3,Lid doesn't attach,Not the most exciting but it is a good learning toy. My biggest complaint is that the lid doesn't attach in anyway.
2,Cheap - lid won't even stay on for baby to put the shapes in,The lid does not even snap onto this toy. It just sits there so of course it comes off as soon as it is bumped. My son doesn't even get the benefit of the shape sorting because he just pulls the lid off to put the shapes in or take them out.
4,fisher price brilliant basics,I bought this for my son on his first birthday. He likes to try to put the shapes into the container. The only problem is there is no way to keep the top attached so he pulls the top off then can't figure out what to do with it. He mainly likes to carry the blocks around lol
3,Could be better,The toy would be perfect if the top actually stayed on better. My son puts the shapes back in but the top always comes off.
4,Back to the Basics--Toy Stands Test of Tim,"I only bought this toy for my daughter's 1st Birthday because it was highly reviewed and you can't beat the price. I thought, ""It looks to simple to be something she'd enjoy."" But I guess the old standards still work. I know this type of block sorter toy has been around for generations and I was pleased to find that my daughter took to playing with it right away. I was shocked that she was so interested in trying to put the correct shapes into the correct holes. She really concentrates on it. The blocks are made so little hands can easily grip them. Only complaint is the lid comes off very easily. It can easily fall off and the blocks spill out when the baby moves it around (carries it, pushes it, kicks it, etc.).Also, since the lid comes off so easily, the baby gets distracted by pulling the lid off and dumping all the blocks out, then putting them all back in without the top...when the point is to put the blocks in through the appropriate hole."
2,Look for a different version,"The top of the box doesn't secure on. So my son doesn't even try to put the shapes in, he just plays with the lid and the box."
4,Baby's First Blocks,"Ho, Ho, Ho and on Christmas morning how lovely it was to see my grandson pull this out of the bag. Easy shopping, easy delivery, the only thing that might make it nicer would be a lockable lid. The little ones love to tote things and the handle is made for toting, the lid however, is not. The lid is fitted loosly and everytime the little feller turned the box the lid fell off and the pieces spilled out. I got a little tired of picking them up."
4,Classic baby toy but ugly packaging,"I ordered this as a gift - the product was as pictured, but is came in a really ugly cardboard box. Being that the gift was for a baby, I was hoping for more attractive packaging - otherwise it was a nice gift."
4,simple and basic,"my baby loves trying to sort the blocks now that she's 14 months, but loved chewing on them well before she knew how to use them."
5,Great classic toy!,"Every child needs this classic toy. The bucket handle is great for taking this toy from one room to another, the colors are bright and the shapes fit like they should. Love this toy."
5,nothing but talent and genius,from ozzy to pride and glory to book of shadows every bit of it is pure genius.if you thought his music was excellent with ozzy its only evolved bigger and better. if you have not heard either one of these albums you are really missing a rare gem to add to your music collection.
1,Whatever happened to???,"I was just thinking about Pride & Glory and the first thing that came to me was: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO?Needless to say, a lot of people have forgotten about this album."
5,Pure rock and roll with alot of attitude!,"I bought this album back when it first came out in 1994. A couple of years later and after listening to it over and over, it wore out. I was bummed that my local music store couldn't get it. Now thanks to Amazon.com, I can get my favorite album of all time once more.Zakk Wylde is one of the most under-rated musicians today. It seems like these days most bands on their albums have one, maybe two good songs and the rest are terrible. Every song on this album is great. Not just in guitar playing but also in song writing. A must have for those love rock and roll. A Classic!"
3,The MG's return! A mixed set.,"Released in 1994, ""That's the Way It Should Be"" marked the MG's first record together since 1977's very disappointing (and somewhat disco-ish) ""Universal Language."" ""That's the Way"" marked the MG's return to the formula that made albums like ""Soul Limbo"" and ""Hip Hug-Her"" so great. Unfortunately, the songs here (both covers and originals) don't quite measure up to the standard of the songs on those great early-period albums (although ""Sarasota Sunset"" comes very close). Another problem is the sonic studio sheen that drains the energy from the songs. I saw the MG's playing these tunes live in 1994 and they sounded much more forceful--a live set of these tunes would have been much better."
5,This is the way it should be (done),This is great. Knowing these guys since the days of Otis Redding this recording makes sure that they still got that touch that made the success of Stax. Go get it!!!!!
4,Good Introduction to Chinese Calligraphy,"Chinese calligraphy is a mammoth subject with thousands of years of history. In addition, calligraphy in Chinese culture has achieved a recognition and respect as an art form that has never been matched by its Western counterparts. Jean Long has written a very readable book that provides an excellent overview to the history of Chinese writing from the tortoise shell oracle bones through bronze inscriptions, pottery vases and, of course, calligraphic scrolls. Also, the author provides basic instructions for how to hold a brush, grind ink, and write a few characters on your own. Given the breadth of the material, the author covers it well, but this book, on account of its brevity, serve as an introduction to whet your appetite. One would then look elsewhere to explore more deeply the various techniques and different calligraphic styles."
3,Ipod Sleeve,It wasn't a perfect fit for my Nano Ipod but with a bit of trouble was able to make it work. Very difficult to put the Nano in and take it out.
3,"Short, but Aged.","I enjoyed reading this book of devotions. Having just graduated a few years ago and intending to return to school in the fall, I figured I might get something out of this book of devotions. The devotions are all short and each has one major point. Some of them give a few interesting tadbits of information and a few offer a really intriguing story.The book has two major drawbacks. One is that there is not enough scripture; most of the daily devotions only have one line or part of a line of scripture. Secondly, the book has aged some since it was first published. Some of the lessons really no longer are applicable to the modern Christian college student. Other than that, it's a decent devotion book for college students."
4,Blue Ink??,"Satisfied with the pen, however when I loaded the pen with the enclosed cartridge after making sure before ordering that I would receive black ink. What do I get?? Blue Ink. This may not seem important to the OEM, however to the consumer it may be a big deal. You say, oh no problem, go and buy black ink. But, that's why I ordered the pen with the black ink!!Next time, when it say's black ink right on the description, please send it!!!One other issue is the shipping time, why the month out shipping date. I would rather order from somewhere else that doesn't take quite as long.Now, as far as the pen, yeah baby, yeah."
1,Allergy warning,"Ricola has changed the sweetener in its products. In the past, the ingredient list included sugar or honey; now it lists ""starch syrup."" Because I had used the drops many times in the past with no ill effects, I did not check the label, trusting that the product was the same as it had been. When I became ill with all the symptoms associated with a reaction to corn, I read the label and then contacted the company to ask what kind of starch was used. I received a response that the syrup was ""derived from corn."" I believe this is deceptive labeling and would advise anyone with a corn allergy not to use this product."
4,These do a great job soothing sore throats and are made from high quality ingredients,"These cough drops are really a first-rate product. They are made in Switzerland and the ingredient list doesn't include artificial ingredients, though they do have natural food-coloring added. In fact, they are made mostly of Swiss-grown herbs with a bit of sugar added for taste.During allergy season here in pollen-filled North Carolina, these drops do wonders for soothing my family's sore throats and keeping coughs at bay.However, these drops do have a pretty strong menthol/herbal taste to them that has taken some getting used to. If you really dislike things that have a strong menthol taste to them, you may want to try Ricola's honey lemon cough drops. The honey lemon drops have the same good quality ingredients in them, but have less menthol and taste more like candy."
1,Unsportsmanlike behavior rewarded,"The main character, Arthur, decides to have a gymnastics contest at his birthday party. He announces to his friends that he will win the award for the best all-around gymnast, and repeatedly tells them that he is better at gymnastics than they are. Then he spends his party sulking because they can do gymnastics well also. His friends then decide to give him the award for best all-around gymnast."
4,"A music fan from Orange Park, Fl","The four stars comes from the very soulful sounds of the Nay on this CD. The audio on the Qanun portion of the cut was distorted - my old real player I hope. The nature of a taqasim is lengthy improvisation on a theme but the cuts were too short to really appreciate the artistry of the performers. From what I could hear, I'd be willing to buy the CD."
1,Pain In @%#&,Got The Wrong CD.Finally found page to report problem.Instructed that I would receive return shipping lable in the mail.CD I ordered not avaliable and may not ever be.Never received return shipping lable.Reported problem of non recipt of lable.Received -e-mail to print my own lable from the wep page.They would later reimburse me for what I would have to payto return the wrong cd.I am not a happy shopper.Way to much effort on my part.I would still like to find the CD.
2,Not as Good as Previous Novels,"Where others have attacked this series of books for not living up to the original Dune, I've tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Sure, they don't compare with Frank Herberet's masterpiece, but then I never expected them to. On their own, the first two novels were good ""Star Wars""-style space opera; however, this book was just not as good. It was almost as if the authors wanted to get the series done and over with so they could move on to other ideas. I think it also lacks in continuity between the other novels. The first two books featured the same characters and followed within several years of the Jihad timeline. This book jumps ahead several decades and introduces and entirely new cast of characters, with the exception of Vorien Atreides who survives because he received life extending treatments from his father. Near the end, the book seems rushed and falls flat. What started out as an OK continuation of the Dune saga fell flat with this novel."
3,Not up to par with the original but ok,"I would compare the Butlerian Jihad Dune prequels with some of the Harry Turtledove series like the World War and Great War Alternate Histories. Lots of characters and subplots but only one or two that really matter. Probably the entire trilogy could have been done in one book that concentrated on Vor, Serena, the Valiant Harkonnens, Erasmus, and Agamemnon. The Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen subplots didn't really work.The end of ""Battle of Corrin"" seems to be setting us up for yet another prequel trilogy documenting the birth of the Guild, the Landsraad, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Mentats. I hope not, but I will probably read them anyway.Its a shame that Herbert died before we could get his entire vision though these books aren't as hard to follow as those by Chris Tolkien."
1,A bit of a disappointment...,"Although the earlier books showed promise, this book lacked any real content. It seemed as if the authors had tired of this series, and just wanted to finish it. The plot was predictable and the characters very uni-dimensional with little if any growth from the previous novels. Reading this was a sad conclusion to my DUNE series (father and son) reading journey. For those who have read the other DUNE books, you will probably need to read this one... However don't rush to buy it and I would wait for the paperback version or better yet, borrow a friend's copy..."
2,Disapointed,I have to say that I am disapointed with they way this book was written. This second set of prequels was not worth the effort. I can only hope a better job is done with the next book.
3,"Yet again, an unfinished work","Much like I thought for the first prequel triology, the Legends of Dune series concludes with a third story that doesn't quite wrap up the story, leaving large, vital chunks of the story in limbo.This series, however, ends on a worse note than the first. Unlike the first series, few of the characters here have shown any development, expect for the robot Erasmus. Second, almost all of the plot follows a confining, this, then that format, allowing for very little natural flow to the story or suspense.I found the Battle of Corrin to be another major disappointment, especially the supposed cowardice of Abulurd Harkonnen. Instead of a coward, he comes off as a tragic hero, and his hatred of the Atriedes seems justified.I suppose now Herbert and Anderson will work on the alleged Dune 7 found in the notes belonging to Frank Herbert. I can only hope they'll do better."
4,"So easy to criticize, so hard to create","These books were great. Are they as good as the original dune books? On the whole, no, but this isn't a case of one writer losing his voice, rather it's two wrtiers who have done a genuinely good job of piecing together the remnants of an awesome storyline. Buy this book, but accept it for what it is: a son trying to finish his father's masterpiece."
2,oh please can we stop now?,"6 reasons to read/ buy this book:1) You endured the Butlerian Jihad and Machine Crusade and now you just got to know how it all ends.2) You are related to the author/ publisher/ distributer and they are expecting feedback.3) You love bad dialogue and incredibly stupid characters who are doomed to repeat their mistakes over and over and over...4) You are insomniac.5) You like to throw big heavy books at people when you are mad and believe me there is plenty here to drive you mad.6) You may be one of the few people on the planet who might actually enjoy this book- there aren't many of you, but there are some."
4,"Honestly, I thought it was pretty good!","Admittedly, it's been about twenty years since I read Dune, and I haven't read the first two volumes in this trilogy. So I don't have the same basis for criticism as some other reviewers. (Some of whom seem to have a screen saver of the Herbert universe on their minds.) But I greatly enjoyed this book. (Or series of tapes, I should say.) I often found myself leaving the car running after I'd arrived at my destination, to hear more. The worlds were perhaps unimaginative -- no local color, really -- but this is a story about people and machines, not a galactic tour. But I still found myself drawn into this strange, yet familiar, alternate world. I don't recall that Dune was THAT much better. Maybe some of the other reviewers are just burned out."
2,The End - Finally!,I am a fan of Frank Herbert. I read this book and series with a mix of slight pleasure and sometimes intense disgust. I suppose I enjoyed the pain. Now this childish pillaging of a great work is at an end!The writing is at a 6 grade level. Everyone is brave or cruel or evil (big words!). Vorian is a 15 year-old trapped in a 135 year-old body.I mean this thing is just so full of holes that if you took the Dune reference away this would be a complete waste of time and money.
3,Not as riveting as Dune,"The book and plot were reasonably well-written and well-developed. However, nothing can comparable with Dune itself. I read the book at my local Barnes and Noble. The one thing I was disappointed with was the 'betrayal' of Abulurd Harkonnen---this was poorly characterzied. What exactly motivated Abulurd to betray ideals and values that he had shared with Vorian for the better part of the preceding 2 decades? However, that said, it is always a treat to re-enter the Dune universe, however fleetingly..."
3,"Not all it could be, but more than others said it is","This book really isn't all that bad as others would have you believe. While Kevin and Brian don't have the overarching and deeply philisopical points to their story like Frank Herbert did they do a fair job on telling a good tale and getting in some background. As for providing information on different things, it would be very difficult for them in a 3 novel series to cover hundreds of years of information after the war but they do provide good insite into many of the instituions in the later Dune novels. Just waiting for Dune 7 and will not be surprised if the Return is because of an Omnius incarnation and religious war is once again spread across the galaxy."
2,Forgot how disappointing,I was missing this one out of the series and wanted to read it to fill the gaps. A necessary read for the series but it drags.
4,Good story with a weak ending,"This book ends the prequel trilogy for Dune.I like the book and enjoy all the puzzles regarding how things evolved before Dune. But the book has a weak ending. When you read about the last big fight against the thinking machines your realize the story doesn't hold up. Humankind could have easily have defeated the machines without bloodshed long before the last battle.Also in the last chapters a lot of characters alters their persona and you do get the feeling that it is a little rushed just to get to the ending.But disregarding that, this was a good book to get the background on the houses and organizations that is part of the Dune Universe. If you like Dune and are a fan of this Universe, then this is a must read."
2,Boring clunky end to the series,"While it sets up Dune, the last third of the book was tired and boring. I needed closure, so I read it, but those who don't vCrd should skip it."
3,Thoughts on Battle of Corin,"The Battle of Corrin is a great history to the Dune universe, but difficult to read. No clear start, middle or end to the story."
3,"Finally, I'm done","At no time have I expected the work of Frank H to be recreated. I did read all the Houses books (which, are better than the Legends series), and once I started the Legends I felt obligated to finish. No reason whatsoever these should have taken three books. A good editor could have made this one decent novel. If the point was to show where all the parts of Dune originated (bene g's, mentats, guild, et al), why did they finally come together in a rush in the last 100 pages of a trilogy? Talk about folding space to make the stars line up!One point about possible ""liberally borrowing from other works"". I just read HG Wells ""War of the Worlds"". The discription of the martians in their machines is VERY much like how the Cymeks and Titans are discribed. Oh well.I fear for the sequel to ""ChapterHouse"" that they are puportedly writing. Hope and pray for an editor."
2,Disappointing,"Having read the two previous (and all other Dune) books, this was disappointing. The characters were more one-dimensional than in the two previous books, the motivations simplistic, the plot less complex and more obviously contrived and directed toward the needed ending. Perhaps most symbolic, there was an unforgiveable error in the year dating the first part of the book; while it should have been printed as 107 B.G., it was written as 69 B.G. This is representative of the thin, poorly thought out nature of the book."
2,A Dune book for Star Wars prequel fans everywhere,"I just finished reading this ""Dune"" book and I have to say I am perplexed. It was mindless entertainment, but I can't count it as good for that very reason. Dune fans have grown up with a series that is steeped in complexities and three dimmensional characters and this is the very thing that keeps us coming back to the series. The original Dune books, while entertaining, all had meaning. This book doesn't. It seems to squander all its potentiality to create real people by limiting their appearences to mere soundbites. In fact the only characters who seem to have been well developed are the robots, simply because there isn't really that much to them. Overall, if you're a Dune fan, you'l act exactly like me. You'll rush out and buy the book, excitedly start to read it-grasping for the sparks of the original series- and ultimatly walk away dissatisfied.AD"
4,"Lots of warrin' in ""Battle of Corrin""","As the Legends of Dune trilogy concludes, authors Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson tie up numerous plot threads and clarify the origins of many elements of Frank Herbert's Dune universe, such as humanity's revulsion of ""thinking machines,"" the Atreides/Harkonnen rivalry, the Fremen, the Spacing Guild, and the Bene Gesserit.This is a very polarizing series. The number of votes for each of Amazon's five star ratings is nearly equal, which I have seen very rarely. I remain steadfast in my opinion that this is a cracking good space opera epic that is less serious thought and more delirious plot than the elder Herbert's version. At this point, I think anyone reading this review already knows whether it has any chance of winning them over."
3,Somewhat anticlimactic,"The Battle of Corrin is well written and entertaining. It also contains the birth, if you will, of the world order found in the original Dune series. It leaves a few large-ish questions unanswered, presumably to leave the door open to more prequels. The biggest questions posed in the first installment of Legends of Dune are answered but some of those answers feel anticlimactic and clumsy in their execution. The resolution of the Harkonnen/Atreides question felt especially unconvincing.The one thing I found interesting in the book is its criticism of democracy, i.e. its inherent lack of long term determination and unwillingness to face critical problems if they have high-cost solutions. This idea is not new, though, and proof of the problem can be found in today's Afghanistan, among other places."
2,Future generations?,"It has been stated many times that this book lacks any substance in comparrison to any book in the Dune Chronicles, so I find no need to expound on that area. Imagine this though, when all of the books are finally written and this trilogy is seen as the first, how many people are going to just give up reading the series and miss out on the brilliant works of Frank Herbert because of the atrocities found here? The authors should be ashamed of themselves and by looking at their website they probably are. The don't have a ""Contact Us"" page anywhere. Maybe they have finally realized their folly and will put their noses to the grindstone for the 7th book. We can only hope..."
3,Not as good as the first 2,"While I am not upset that I read the book (after reading all the previous dune books, I couldn't skip it), it was not as goos as the othjer Legends of Dune books. The handling of the future feud between the two houses was pretty poor and was one of the themes that was most important to the future stories. Anyway, if you are a Dune fan, you might as well read it, but buying a paperback is advised."
1,More than meets the ear,"While an interesting mandolin treatment traditional seasonal favorites, the CD's title as it appears on the jacket is: ""Snowed In With a Mandolin On CHRISTmas Day"" and the only vocal is a reading of Luke 2:14's ""peace, good will toward men"" over ""O Come, All Ye Faithful"" rather than the proper lyrics. It might be noted that Luke 2:14 is much disputed - the preferred reading being ""peace toward men of good will."" Further notes from the CD's jacket: ""Praise the Lord,"" ""To Him who sits on the throne,"" ""A special love and appreciation to my parents ... for their dedication to God...."" You get the picture. If what you're interested in an acoustic string rendering of traditional holiday tunes, something like Windham Hill's ""Holiday Guitar Collection"" might be a better choice."
5,well made flag,I purchased this as a gift for my Mother and she loves it. It's been hanging outside of her house for about two years now and doesn't look worn at all.
2,Not quite what I expected.,I am a bit disappointed in this product. I have tried it before when I was on my cruise. The cake was super moist and it taste delicious. That is what prompted me to order this cake online. When I finally sampled the cake it was very dry. It wasn't moist nor could you taste the rum. I believed the cake was old. It was not fresh at all. I guess I will have to go to the Caymen Islands to get the full experience.
3,Good but too mild,"I like bright vibrant colors and flavorsThese cakes were not that, so to me they were just alrightI found the original and chocolate mild and subtle (people who water their coffee down would like them...I like concentrate from the can)The coconut was nice, and I may buy that one againBasically, this is a 6 pack. buy it, share it, try it, hog it, flaunt it, enjoy it, etc etcIf you go out to dinner and try dessert, think of it this way - its dessert at the houseThe shrink wrap on the cakes are very thick and will keep it plenty fresh for a long time (though the fresher the better, don't want 6+ month old cake)"
4,very tasty,These cakes are quite good. The six pack is a good way to test out the flavors! Very moist and flavorful. A little pricy but worth it
5,Torguga Rum Cakes,"I have been a lover of this rum cake for years, ever sense I vacationed on Gand Cayman Island.The very best!"
1,UPS and Cake,"Unfortunately, i never received my tortuga rum cakes. UPS left this with someone in the building and I never ever received it I went to the person's apt. after tracking the order and to pickup the cakes and they said UPS gave them a computer which they had ordered instead. No cakes. So I can't tell you if the cakes were good or bad.Please do not let UPS leave anything with anyone unless you're home to sign for it. This happened this Christmas 2008, I was heartbroken because I had paid for this already including shipping and handling. It added to an unhappy part of my Christmas.Thanks."
3,Good but not as fresh as getting right there on Barbados,Nice present to give and the the flavors are unique. We were hooked on these cakes when we last visited Barbados.
5,"Murder, Romance, Lies and Great Characters.....","The Bride's Bodyguard by Elizabeth Thornton is a fantansic writer. In this novel a group of women have been murdered because they witnessed a drowning when they were young. Tessa is the last of witnesses living happily in france with Grandfather until Ross Trevenan changes everything. If you enjoy this genre, I would also check out The Lady Lies, The Lady Killer and The Lady's Code by Samantha Saxon"
4,How to save more than a bride...,"I liked this story about a mystery that had happened long ago. It was interesting to see the hero and heroine get together in this story. Both are strong characters that over time have had to overcome a lot. Tessa has been sent from person to person until she escapes to her Grandfathers home, while Ross has lived with the torment of the death of his wife whom Tessa might hold the key to the killer. I liked how the characters were human etc... In this one they basically use Tessa as bait, when she would have gladly done it herself... See how this turns out..."
1,If I didn't love my kindle so much I would have thrown it across the room,"This book is awful. Tessa is a childish, annoying heroine and Ross is an overbearing jerk. It is an endlessly frustrating book. If you like your heroes to treat the heroine like he's her father and full of arrogant I-know-better-than-you attitude then this book is for you. The ""mystery"" isn't compelling. Ross's motives all center around his dead wife and yet we're supposed to believe that the reason he's so terrible is all for the greater good. Save your money."
2,more about safty then comfort,"I wanted something thick and soft so my baby couldn't feel the plastic under his sheet. This one is so thin you can almost see through it. There is hardly any quilting. Another down side is you have to take the mattress completely out of the crib to put it on. But it does help a little and is a safe fit, and washes well."
4,great read. worth the time,"Blood of the Fold is, in my opinion, the best book Goodkind has written. When I first started it, I decided to take it slow, having just come off of the monumentous task of reading the 1000 page stone of tears. Goodkind, however, drew me in with his marvelous plot and characters. I did find it odd that he named the book blood of the fold, and they really didn't play a big part in my eyes, but that is, for the most part, the only thing bad worth mentioning. If you have read the first two books, definatly pick this one up."
5,Only do Audio and this was lousy,PLEASE go back to Brilliance Corp. This audio version was the pits. I would purchase it again if you can get the rights released and retaped by Brilliance. For those of us who only do Audio the complete word for word is the only way to go and I hope book #5 is unabridged.
4,"Read the story, not the sex","Sorry to do two reviews in a row, but (IMHO) it is the lack of richness, the rehashing of ideas, which detracts from what is otherwise a damned good story.The question is not whether Terry is some sort of perv who gets his kicks by writing about strange sex, because the sex and violence that he includes fits into the world he's created. The worst rape would be if he had created this vibrant, living world but then removed its balls by leaving out the darker side.The question is whether or not Terry can get the series back on track by expanding the original ideas and adding fresh ones.If you don't like sex then avoid books like ""Dracula"" as well, and if you hate violence, especially the mindless sort, avoid ""Hansel and Gretel""."
4,Hey mister! You want a good book?,"When I started ""Wizard's First Rule"" I thought, ""This is just like a dozen other fantasy books I've already read"". Twenty pages later, I didn't care. Goodkind writes really good stories. They're based around old themes; a lot of it's like a diet version of the ""Wheel of Time"", except without the brain-melting sensation. But still, it's some of the best fantasy I've read in years."
5,The SoT series is amazing!,"Anyone who says that the SoT series is just like everyone else's hasn't read enough to compare.They are not just good vs. evil.Sure there it's there, but there are other deeper themes involved.Mr Goodkind has obviously put a lot of thought into his books.The idea of the skrin and the wizard's wars in which the towers were erected, are fabulous.And it's not just Richard against an enemie, each book is the aftermath of the book before it.just like in our world feces happens, and you have to deal with it.Richard is dealing with that feces.It's a ten!"
2,Goodkind uses big effects without cause,"I've read all three of his books, and the worst thingabout them is that Goodkind uses far too big effects withoutreason. Everything is huge, grand and largely impersonal. This causes the story to lose its emotion, because everything is just so unbelievable--huge battles where thousands die but we knew none of them, hundreds of raped women that we didn't know, etc. If he made his atrocities more personal, it would read better."
2,Goodkind is a follower who will be forgotten,"Goodkind never dares venture beyond those limits alreadyestablished for fantasy, and in not doing so, his plot andworld in general are bland and lifeless. I'll admit he's fun in place...but I know better things to do than read the re-hashed adventures of all the characters ever written about in fantasy. He'll be thankfully forgotten and out-of- print soon. That's the way of all followers."
1,This was the beginning of the end,"Just pretend that this book didn't exist. Stone of Tears and Wizards First Rule remain to be my favorite books. This book introduced a new nemesis called emperor Jagang that seems to pop up as an excuse to extend this series indefinitely. No mention of him in the two pervious books except at the epilogue of Stone of Tears. The story plot also becomes a little sloppy starting with this book.If you really wanna treasure this series, don't do what I did. Stop at Stone of Tears and forget about the rest."
3,pay by the page,"These books aren't really well written. If you start the series expecting Robin Hobb or George R R Martin, you WILL be disappointed. Nevertheless, each book in this series is pretty readable if rather predictable. I like them because they're long, 1000 pages for $8 is cheap entertainment."
2,My first Goodkind read,"This was my first Terry Goodkind book . . . and will be my last. I bought it at a booksale at work, always looking for something new to read- this looked interesting. I've read the Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series, and realized about 10 pages in that this storyline was similar. I enjoyed the Jordan series, so i thought, okay, this will be good. Wrong. Shallow characters, transparent plot lines . . . I'm ashamed to say that I actually finished this book. It gets 2 stars because I did finish it, but that goes more to my tenacity than to the quality of the writing or the story. Don't waste your time."
2,"The end of the ""Sword of Truth"" series","Generally I am not one to stop and write a review of a book, but I felt the need to warn others who have limited time to invest in sci-fi series novels. I have read the first two installments of this series ""Wizards First Rule, and Stone of Tears,"" both excellent novels. I went ahead and bought ""Blood of the Fold:"" which was a great disappointment. Mr. Goodkind degenerates into endless feminist tirades that take away from the plot and spoil the book. I had been looking forward to the next two books. I would suggest readers stop after the first two. I stopped reading half way through this one."
2,better than the first 2 but still marginal,Eh. That about somes it up. There are better books out there; there are better authors author. By the same token there are worse books and worse authors. Plotting by the numbers here folks.
2,This is turning into a Formula,"Good guy meets bad guy. Good guy wins. Been there, done that. First story was nice. Second was justlike first. Third just like both. Yawn."
1,A Two Hit Wonder?,"After watching two spell binding seasons of 'The Legend of The Seeker' based on the first two books I felt an emptiness. So I did the logical thing and bought this book. What a let down! Goodkind writes like an amateur and his protagonist, Richard fares worse. Richard behaves like a lab rat jumping impulsively at every provocation but somehow miraculously surviving every unimaginatively plotted challenge.The plot runs like a video game, one long series of inane obstacles fostered by cartoon characters and then brought to an abrupt end without a conclusion.Goodbye Mr. Goodkind. I am on to a more satisfying read by George R Martin.I probably won't force myself to go through any other subsequent books in this series."
2,Audio Book Blood of the Fold,"The book is an excellent continuation of the series. However, I got 2 disk 12 and no disk 13 in the package. I went to the bookstore and read what disk 13 should have had and I didn't miss much. It was just irritating and not worth arguing about refunds over.."
5,for the person below,"I believe that this book is very good. After all, it's just the way you look at things. Your very own pov and perspective."
4,Good book,"I have really been enjoying reading the Sword of Truth series. They can be a bit graphic though, especially in some of the fight scenes. This one so far is a little milder then the last one. Can't wait to read the next book in this series."
1,More of the same,"While Wizard's First Rule was a really enjoyable read, by the time we reach this the third book the series is becoming formulaic and simply annoying. Its seems to always be the same; something threatens Richard and Kahlan's relationship (usually a threat to the whole world as well), which is resolved by the end of the book. It's just the same stuff all over again."
1,"Empty world, empty heads","Terry Goodkind's ""world"" is just a bunch ofstuck-together cliches without a life of itsown. Some may say that Goodkind is ""holding back"" on world details because he is using Richard's viewpoint, but Frodo Baggins knew even less than Richard about Middle Earth at large and Tolkien's world still came alive in the first chapter of the first book. If the author truly has spent time on his world, there's just a ""knowing"" quality to the writing...even though there may not be a lot of details, we still feel like the author knows this place well and is taking us on a tour of it. With Goodkind, this feeling is noticably absent."
3,a good read but not his best.,"I just read the first 4 books in this series and the first 2 are the best by far. All are well written and good stories but the action kind of died down somewhat in the 3rd and 4th installments, but great storytelling nonetheless.Great job by a great autthor."
1,It's coming in Oct. Why does it seem so long?,"Is this book going to deal with Richard and Kahlan's child? Or with the Imperial Order?Or neither,or both"
5,Great!!!,This novel is one of the bes ever in alld the books I have read inncluding tolkien bradbury I could not put it down until my eyes were non working!!! read it you won't regret it
4,Blood of the Fold,Personally my favorite book in the sword of truth saga. All my friends and I have a few things in common. This is one of them. We all relate to the characters and sistuations within the covers of this book. Thank you Goodkind!!!
1,Excellent book,Love these stories. They are well written and also have a message. I like that the story comes to somewhat of an end but then more adventures are picked up in the next book.
4,Sword of Truth Series,"I ordered Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth Series in the Kindle version; I like the story, though it is way too similar to the Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" series, even using some of the same names for main characters; but my main issue is with the editing: there are many errors in spelling, missing words, double words and other editorial issues; I'm hoping this is not true for other Kindle products I have yet to finish reading, but it's been true in the books of this series I've read thus far; I do love how they appear on my Kindle through the ""ethers,"" and, in general, like the story, but not the repetition (which feels like a means of bringing the reader up to date if they missed the earlier books, but is tedious to wade through if you have read the all)"
3,3.5 stars,"This book is not quite as good as the first two. An interesting back story begins to emerge about the ancient war between the wizards and the dream walkers. A lot of interesting background information is presented, but the main plot line is a bit weaker than the first two books.After this book, the series starts to really go downhill."
4,Good book,As ever Mr. Goodkind write a long windy book where the main plot gets wrapped up very quickly in a chapter or 2.
5,great series,the seeker continues; love this book series and the tv series- you must read the books to get the whole story
2,Read Tad Williams instead,"While I somewhat enjoyed the first two books, the third left me cold. I cannot imagine that this book would have ever been published on its own. I can only imagine that it was due to the the success of the previous two installments. Unfortunately, I will stop reading the SoT series here. There is not enough time for things like SoT when I know there is better work out there. Do yourself an immense favor and read the Tad Williams books in the ""Memory, Sorrow and Thorn"" series starting with the ""Dragonbone Chair""."
3,"Hardly a great book, but still worth reading.","I read this one a couple of years ago when it first came out. I found it to be rather dissapointing unfourtunatley. I loved the first two despite there obvious similarites too Jordans Wheel of Time series, so I was really looking forward to this one. Still worth reading though. The next book in the series more than makes up for this one though! Mildly recommended."
3,Goodkind has done better.... But keep reading his series....,"Blood was not the worst book I've ever read, but was very close ranking... But... If you bothered to read this book, pick up the next in the series, you will not be disapointed in the least"
5,"Outstanding,an exciting entry to Goodkind's work.","Terry Goodkind makes another outsanding adventure adding to his allready exellent series the sword of truth.This story is one I'll read over and over.I thought I liked Wizards first rule,but this was much better.I would recomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading fantasy."
2,not near as good as his usual,"Terry Goodkind is ussualy a very good author. But I really didnt like this one, but I read on past this one because I had really liked the previous two. Im happy I did because I found out that The Blood of the Fold was only writen to set up the next book. Even if you didnt like this book i suggest to read on i garenty that you will be happy you did."
5,Truly an enjoyable read.,"The latest in the Sword of Truth series is proving the TerryGoodkind is not a flash in the pan. The writing has maturedin each of his books and continues to improve. He has notjust given us a bunch of people to follow around, but hasdeveloped them into true characters that we can root for, oragainst. This latest installment in the Sword of Truth serieshas expanded on the overall theme of the series andgives you a new insight into this world.It also has brought to light an entirely new theme thatwill allow the series to continue to hold our interestin the future. I highly recommend this book as I doBooks 1 & 2 in the series. Enjoy..."
3,"Good, but slightly disappointing.","Hmm...where to begin? First, I thought the book was very fast paced, but had no real developement to the plot. Though, I do admire it for its realism. After all; life is not always productive. I thought that him repeating the fact that Richard is The Bringer of Death was getting really annoying by the end of the book. I have read the fourth one though, and to all of you hoping that it will be better; trust me, it is!"
2,What in the Hell?,"I was tempted to rate this a 1, but decided that the sheer gore and brutality made _Blood of the Fold_ readable, if not overly stimulating. The running theme of these books is not truth, but is instead an oversexed fetishism that would shock and disturb veteran purveyors of hard core pornography. Incest, rape, and sexual torture seem to lurk around every corner of Goodkind's universe, reflecting dubious qualities of the author. Terry Goodkind has all the appeal of a letter-to-the-editor from a dirty magazine."
2,"Repetitive, Repetitive, Repetitive,.......","I thought the first two books were excellent...and as a frequent reader of series books, I could not WAIT to move on to Book 3. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT. All T.G. does in this book is recap the first two books and the entire history of each person, object, place, etc. EVERY TIME it is mentioned. It was so annoying that I couldn't wait to get through it. I will tell you that I only got into Book 4 about one chapter before I returned it. T.G. started the same stuff as he did in Book 3 with repeting and explaining everything. In addition, the characters in the first two books were detailed as far as we knew them intimately. The third book just showed us glimpses of each character. It was difficult to relate to any of them. Overall, I was very disappointed."
3,Slightly better than Stone of Tears,"I think this one was a bit better than the previous book with Richard now the king of d'hara and the devious Emperor Jagang as his opponent. Jagang seems is powerful and the story lines move along nicely and are well written with interesting characters. Still, I think there are too many items that are derivative of Jordan."
4,Editing!,"I love this series, and whilst I felt there were a good many gaps in it...maybe they'll be filled by the next book... I have to say that the editing is really bad. Not enough to make me stop reading, but simple grammatical and spelling errors have no place in a New York Times best Author's book! I almost felt like getting out my red pen...but then realized, *oops, reading this on an iPad!*"
3,It's all about audience...,"This, and the two previous books in the series, are average works, at best. My fiancee picked up BotF and started reading the first few pages and I felt I had to defend myself. Goodkind writes like an adolescent, 'Richard thought writing was hard.' What happened to ""showing"" the reader, rather than ""telling"" the reader? That's what characterization is about, not having one woman in red leather with red hair and another woman in red leather with black hair.Which brings up another point some people have made already: what's with the comic book characters? Strong, sexy, handsome man. Sexy, beguiling woman. Sexy, lesbian lovers. Big, strong bodyguards. Worse even than Jordan.Terry Goodkind writes for teenagers. If you want good fiction (fantasy or science) pick up Orson Scott Card or David Brin."
5,BLOOD DEATH MAYHEM!,Goodkind steps up the action in this latest instalment of the sword of truth series. The editing isbetter though not great.
4,Can't put them down,I find I have become completely involved with the characters. It is a very complex story lots going on but so easy to read very enjoyable escape
3,Fantastic story.,The reason for only 3 stars. If this was the first author/book I read on my KindleI I would ship my Kindle back. All the errors in this story is frustrating.As for the book.. the story sucks you in and won't let you up for air until the last word.
4,Blood of the Fold,The third book was well written and had a great storyline. The sense of closure was well thought out and will lead into book four. This book wasn't as captivating as the first two books though.
2,Terry Takes Some Writing Lessons,"Well, maybe (more on this later). I really didn't like the first two books, but I have to admit, that this one was somewhat better written. The action is a little better here. but the love theme is getting a bit worn out at this point. This book moves better than the first two, but that's not saying much. I give this 2 1/2 stars, but would have given it 3 except that parts of the ending are so contrived and rushed that its as if the author had had enough of writing and just wanted to tie things up. Since all of the loose ends were neatly and quickly tied in the last couple pages, I'm taking this time to bow out of this series. I've had enough."
3,Good first efforts,"Terry Goodkind's first three books in this series (the only ones I have read) have the hint that Goodkind may some day write a wonderful fantasy series. However, this series is not it. It's a great series for young readers but I would skip it if your tastes run to the more mature. If you're just looking for some filler until the next George Martin book is published you won't find this book unbearable but it won't be enthralling by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Terry Goodkind is amazing.,"For those of you who don't like him, why read him? I love this series and Blood of the Fold was an excellent edition. Though Terry Goodkind needs to work hard to reach the greatness that is J.R.R. Tolkien, I think he could do it. When he does, I will give him fives. Until then, the only series I will give a five is LOTR."
1,Hack Author Hates Amazon?,"Quote the Author:""These people [Amazon.com] have set up a system which invites fraud,"" Goodkind said. ""It embraces deception, and there's no interest in integrity. The Internet is like the Old West, and Amazon's the lynch mob.""... July 2000]I DON'T THINK SO! Goodkind is referring to comments posted under his name. I don't think Amazon acted with foul intent when they included the ""I am the Author"" link. Geez, Goodkind, take it out on the little goon who impersonated you, instead of Amazon.com. I'm sure your hackwork ultimately profited by Amazon.com.An AMAZON fan!"
1,MAKE IT STOP,"As a younger man I slogged my way through Goodking's pretentious, right-wing, morally-confused objectivist claptrap along with all the other young men who had nothing else to read. Here's the bottom line.It's bad.Reading Goodkind is like...it's like...you know what? I will put a scenario to you.Imagine that one day you awaken to find that a giant turtle is in your bed. Surprised, you attempt to vacate the bed. A woman's arm emerges from the turtle's mouth and pins you to the mattress. New mouths open in the turtle's shell and begin to bellow unrepeatable truths as your ceiling dissolves into a rich mixture of ragu meat sauce and cellophane. At any moment it will rain down upon you in a merciless torrent.You will die.This is reading Goodkind.Do yourself a favor. Grab Robert Jordan, Glen Cook, Joe Abercrombie, Ricardo Pinto, George R. R. Martin, Daniel Abraham. Anything but this torture-obsessed maniac."
3,Do I hear Wheel of Time?,I like the Sword of Truth series but it is sooo much like Wheel of Time. Sisters of Light=Aes Sedai Sisters of dark=Black Ajah Blood of the Fold=Children of the Light Currently I am in the process of writing a fantasy epic but it is not cloned like this is. Read this series if you are desperate for another fantasy series.
2,Hoping for Better,Another okay novel in the Sword of Truth series. I keep thinking that I will fall for these and eagerly anticipate the next one but I'm still only mildly attached. I have a few more in the series on my shelf already so I'll keep going with higher hopes for the next one.
5,My favorite series,"Though Blood of the Fold isn't my favorite of the entire series, I've read it many times and enjoy it."
1,This book is suitable for toilet paper.,"He's got the one dimensional character thing down pat. Goofy, but extremely powerful wizard who does nothing. Big, handsome doofus. Guy with lots of weapons. Lesbian sado-masochists... Is this supposed to be interesting? Or did Terry have a D&D campaign that got really weird? Why does everyone get more or less powerful depending upon what moves the plot? Adie kicked the asses of numerous undead creatures on her own, yet her and Zedd couldn't take down the reanimated remains of something that Adie had already slain herself! Why is it that Gars can't see an elephant unless its running at top speed, yet they can see a mriswith 500 miles away? Stop the Contradictions!"
4,"Great content, an integral section of the Sword of Truth ser",This book is action packed and at the same time gives an in depth report of Kahlin's homeland. The only fault that I could find in the book is that it was too short. This is justified because it is a story inside the series and could not be made larger without rambling. I eagerly await the next installment.
5,The best books I've ever read,The sword of truth is the most creative and imaginative books I've found yet! You can't stop reading them
5,Blood of the fold....but could not fold the book closed.,"""Blood of the Fold"" was mesmerizing. I simply could not put it down. Goodkind's rendering of characters are so lifelike and real. I can't wait to read the next book. Richard Rahl and Kahlan Amnell aways keep me guessing. You'll love this one!!!"
4,Not quite as good as the first two in this series,Although I enjoyed this book almost as much as the first two this one seemed to get rather streched out and mudied. At times the author didn't really seem to know where he was going
2,SHOULD BE PRESENTED UNABRIDGED!,TO MUCH IS LEFT OUT IN THE ABRIDGED. IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED IN UNABRIDGED. I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY PUBLISHERS THAT WILL NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE RIGHTS WILL NOT RELEASE THEM. THAT IS NOT RIGHT TO THOSE OF USE WHO A WAIT THE UNABRIDGED STORY.
2,A BIG fall down the hill,"WHAT HAPPENED? WFR & SoT where great. But this book. Half of it didn't even make any sense. I've read it four times already and I still don't get half of it. I think Terry's just starting to make it up as he goes. The book it self is okay and I would give it a 6, but I gave it a 4 because it's a real disapointment to the series..."
2,What happend?!,I read the first two books in the sword of truth series and they were amazing! But this one just... I don't it was just bad.
2,Good plot -- one-dimensional writing and character devlpmnt.,"Read this book if you enjoy a story filled with similar one-dimensional characters.In 'Blood of the Fold,' Goodkind continuesto put together interesting plots that arefilled with characters who are either good or bad.The characters in this series behave and react so similarly that reading the book is like listeningto a musician play a single note, without inflection.Goodkind writes his characters at extremes. Characters are either weeping or jumping for joy,are either intelligently saving themselves orstupidly falling into the latest trap in orderto advance the plot.Mr. Goodkind should try to make use of subtlety and a real range of character types in his writing. In trying to avoid the constant barrage of extremes, he woulddo well to remember, as Anthony Lane of the New Yorker wrote, that there is nothing so boringas being excited all the time."
3,So-So effort third time around,"Goodkind brings out his third novel in record time(for hardbackfantasy series). Next time he should take his time! His""borrowing"" from Jordan is getting more obvious. Unlike others, I don't think he is a bad writter, in fact he is very entertaining. But he needs to come up with some original stuff. It has gotten so bad that I'm surprised Jordan hasn't had a hissy fit considering they are at the same publishing house!Also like Eddings and Brooks, he tends to rework previous material and call it a new novel--Boo! Hiss! Something to read until the next Jordan or George R R Martin book comes out. But with his obvious talent he should take more time and effort--I think it would be worth the wait!"
3,"Engaging, but clearly a book written to be a bridge.","The tale is good, the action is quick, but it is clear that this book is not a primary book in the series. This book can be read as a stand alone work, but it is much better if the proceeding three books have allready been read. This book is used to develop some new characters, continue the story started in the Stone of Tears, and to set the stage for later books. That having been said, I did enjoy reading this book. I enjoyed the humor that is in the book, the interplay between Zed and Ann at the inn is delightfull. There is also a good bit of suppressed drama in the book, with the primary parties missing link-up with each other by scant measure.I do recommend this book for reading, but only as part of the series. If this book is read as a stand alone, it is likely to be somewhat unclear."
3,Good story but frustrating,"I find myself frustrated a bit with the third book. It seems that the bulk of the story is nothing but pain, frustration, and strife. It's one of those two steps forward, one step back kind of plays. Get on with it save the day already!"
3,Another villian to vanquish,"Having killed his father, Oedipus, er Richard finds that another villian is threatening his future. This time, it is the 'blood of the fold' that wants to hamper any future happiness Richard may have. These vicious killers want to destroy anyone having anything to do with magic. Richard and Kahlan stand in their way. Reminded me a little of the inquisition."
5,Absolutely incredible,"LOVED! LOVED! LOVED! This book! It started out a little slow, but after a while it picked up. Goodkind is a genius. I really love the Sword of Truth series. can't wait to get to book #4! I liked book #2 a little better than this one, but this definitely keeps the story alive with our favorite characters.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
2,Not his best work,"I would normally give a book such as this a rating of 3 but due to Goodkind's previous work this is pale in comparison. The first two books were well done and captured my attention and my time until the very end. The only reason I actually finished reading this one was because it was so short and I am hoping the 4th book will be better. Goodkind spends half the time reminding us of things we already knew from reading the first two books, if somebody is new to the series they might want to think about starting at book one, I for one don't want half the book to remind me of things I already knew. I hope his next book doesn't dissapoint or I will be done with this series."
1,"I hate to say this, but this book is terrible.","The first book was one of the best I have ever read. It was almost perfect. I loved it, just as I think others did too. The second book was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable. But this Blood of the Fold, book 3, this book is horrid! I cannot believe it is even the same author. I truly hate to give bad reviews on someone's work, but this book is bad. Please do not put yourself through the torment. I got so disgusted with how boring it was, that I am no longer reading on in the series. I think anyone who does is foolish."
4,VERY GOOD PICTURE,"Ive been very happy with my 563S t.v. Although its not high def. I still have a fantastic picture thru my ""s"" video connection. Colors are bright and well seperated and the 32' screen is just right for my room. It has composite, ""s"" viedo and componet conections for dvd and such. It also has front a.v. inputs for games or a camcorder. The internal menu can be adjusted to quite a few settings and the t.v. has four pre-set modes for certin things like movies or sports. Although its sound settings can be adjusted. I recomend playing movies and such through your home theater. I have digital cable and the picture is just so clear I really cant belive it. The remote is just a standard deal it controls two other devices. The design of the screen gives you the feeling that the screen is flat, especially when viewing staight on. Quite a nice analog set. Recommended."
1,CAUTION breaks quickly and has NO warranty!,"I just want potential buyers to know that the email and phone contacts listed within the warranty and on their website are invalid and I can find no other way to contact customer service to replace the mouse that broke within a month of purchase. It is supposed to be covered under warranty, but I guess not. What a scam! So buy this product and other products from this company with caution!"
3,Preferences,"The line between a genious solo-artist and a ego-centric maniac is very thin. It is clearly subjective. For me it entirely depends on whether I like the artist (Michael Brecker) or not (Mainieri). This album passes the test, also because of great drumming, but it is not a 5 like other Brecker CDs"
2,What a mess,"This recording is perhaps one of the worst I have ever encountered. I admit to having only listened to it for few minutes before giving up, but what a mess of an effort. I am sure that when this was originally broadcast there must have been a narrator. Here it is merely a series of voices and it makes things very difficult indeed. There are also some rather rural accents featured on this recording, making it extremely difficult for an American to follow. This is a well-intended, but ultimately a mess of an attempt to render one of the novels of Dickens into drama. The whole thing seems like someone brought a tape recorder down to the pub on a Friday night and hoped for magic to take place."
3,Boundless Profundity,"The Raven dialog drives this novel. I specifically enjoyed the nibbling, figurative and literal, upon Barnaby's shoulder. A delicious pile of words."
2,Not your first Dickens,"There are many pages in this book that are still alive, but here is a novel that, I'm afraid, would tend to confirm the suspicions of some readers who haven't read Dickens yet -- that he's wordy. This gets two stars, but that's because this book is being compared to other novels by Dickens. If it were by some Victorian unknown, we'd be whooping about a rediscovered goodie! Mostly I enjoyed it, but I doubt very much I'll ever read the first 200 pages or so word-for-word. I should note that I didn't read an edition that had the Penguin editorial notes."
5,Historical fiction,This is an overlooked novel of Charles Dickens' but any fan of his or of ripping good stories will more than enjoy it. And the price is right!
4,Original Southern Belles including Anthony,These southern bells are tolerable and very funny. Julia could have made less speeches for my taste. Suzanne and Anthony were awesome.
2,Designing Women 3rd Season,"I bought several seasons on Designing Women and at least one disk in each of the boxed sets had issues, either it would skip or some of the episodes wouldn't play at all. Since we purchased multiple seasons, it took time before we realized that this issue was pervasive throughout all of the boxed sets. Severely disappointing as this was a gift."
1,Bad unit?,"I have other FRS radios, and I though this would be good for the kids to wear to keep track of them. When someone talks on the unit, the words are totally garbled on the other end. Pretty much useless. J&R does not pay for shipping, so $$ on the way back and $$ for a replacement is not worth it. It's possible I got a bad unit, but I'm not investing anymore of my time, except to finish this review."
5,"Puts ""official"" releases to shame...","....by ""official"" releases, I mean releases from the ""BIG"" companies, so out of touch with their customers. Thank God for small independent labels. If you're a HOOKFOOT fan, this is a ""no-brainer"", for those of you scratching your heads, HOOKFOOT was a group of then current/past ELTON JOHN musicians, Caleb Quaye (guitar), Roger Pope ( drums), Fred Gandy (Bass) and Ian Duck (Vocals, harmonica), who played driving, funky, rock 'n soul, with an occasional side of blues. This album was recorded live at the legendary Ardent Studio in Memphis for a long-forgotten radio program. The concert is excellent, and the sound is wonderful. The full tune-stack is:1. TAXMAN (3:25)2. IF I HAD THE WORDS (4:21)3. THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP THERE (6:10)4. HERE I COME (16:04)5. CUCKOO (5:27)6. CRUSIN' (6:58)7. NATURE CHANGES (11:09)8. FREEDOM (9:47)If you're ever lucky to find this, grab it quick!"
5,Definately Five Stars,"I organize a small mystery book club in my town with four or five women who attend regularly. We recently read Intimate Falls and had a great time talking about the novel. One of the girls did a bit of research on the author and we found out that Lance Rucker does quite a bit of research for his books. We all agreed that's probably why the world of BD seems so completely real to us.On a side note, three of the women in my group completely fell for ""Brandy"" and couldn't stop raving about him. I'm pretty sure their husbands will not appreciate the fact that the book club is going to read the second in the BD Series in a few weeks! ;)"
2,think twice before reading,"think twice before reading this book. although it was entertaining, there was no evidence leading to the climax of the story. I was extremely dissapointed and I do not think this book is worth reading. It was a bummer to find no twists in the plot and the ending needs some work."
4,Eerily good...,"It's really a shame that the book can't be found anymore. It's make me glad I got a copy when I did. Mystery and fright are all in the book. D.E. Athkins really knows how to use twists and turns to keep you guessing. It's entertaining to sit while you have an hour free to read. If you can get a copy, do it."
5,An inspirational tale,"Once you start reading, it feels like roller coaster journey leading you through paths that make your muscles tense, relax and gives you the ""Ah"" feeling. It's a truly memorable read."
1,uh.,"This is one of only two books that I've ever really tried to read, and found myself unable to complete. The other was ""The Talisman"" by Stephen King.I think the most difficult thing for me to swallow were the names. ""Thomas Covenant the UNBELIEVER,"" for one. But I almost threw it out the car window when I read about ""Lord Foul the DESPISER."" I am sorry, but my youngest cousin (five) would be able to come up with more creative names. I resisted the temptation, however, when I remembered that it belongs to my library.When I have more time, and more patience, I may try to read this again. But now I will go back to reading a series that is definitely worth while, ""The Wheel of Time"" by Robert Jordan"
1,Much ado about nothing,"You read and read and read, and it all just comes down to nothing. Nothing at all..."
1,This book was horrible,"This book was horrible and depressing. While it might have had its redeming points, I couldn't get past the his raping of the woman in the beginning of the book. I don't care if he's a leper and can now feel his lower region. This story was horrible and should be avoided at all costs."
5,The state of the Land is a rot,"The pain flows through the pages into the firing neurons of the brain, sending shock to the heart as the reader finds Lord Foul has raped and pillaged the Land, bastardized it to a state of flailing fish-out-of-water. There seems to be nothing but despair as the evil sunbane has taken over and the beautiful people sacrifice bits of theirselves to conjure power everytime. There seems to be no way out as Harukai are fettered in the catacombic bowels of a prison waiting to bleed for the sunbane. The unreality and the unjustification of such incidence pains the reader, praying for a panacea to cure this rotten state. Thomas Covenant is the only hope and Linden Avery makes for a new hope. This piece is written perfection of everything wrong in the world, the corruptible everything, and the curable nothing. This paralell with mankind is insightful and poignant. This book is intriging and painful, but no doubt, one of Donalson's best."
5,Best of all the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant novels!,"Thomas Covenant who at the end of the first trilogy had saved The Land and learned to love it, is returned to The Land a thousand years later. The Land has been corrupted by the evil of Lord Foul and nearly all the beauty and magic has been perverted to evil.Thomas Covenant, the White Gold Wielder, and his new companions search for a way to end the worst of the evil, the dreaded Sunbane, and restore beauty upon The Land.Be warned that the 2nd trilogy goes downhill starting with THE ONE TREE and never recovers its wonder and fascination until the end in WHITE GOLD WIELDER."
5,Back to the Land,"Covenant comes across much less obnoxious in this series, although he is still often paralyzed into immobility by his out-of-control emotions. The Land has vastly changed, which gives this series a fresh feel. The introduction of Linden Avery, another emotional basket-case, adds a nice dimension. I would like to read a book that helps me decipher all Donaldson's religios symbolism."
4,Dissapointing,"I want to start by saying i enjoyed these books tremendously, i felt it was well written well described and detailed. But as luck would have it i found the last book to be most upsetting. I mean you go through the whole series of books learning to respect the main character Thomas Covenant and see the main battles he confronts ,personnel conflicks within himself, and it is all summarised by anew character. Not. I feel as through ive been ripped off. I think the author is a great story teller, but why did he go this way, you are led to believe through the battles he fought ,the self denials, that he would finnally get it he was the one, not some newcomer a doctor. I see where the author was going but a doctor, anew character. No. I really believe he should have lived through the final battle with the doctor in tow, to maybe show him the way to self acceptance i dont know but i read all the books and was gravely dissapointed, he should have won over evil not a doctor."
4,Good start to a darker fantasy series,"Donaldson starts out his new series by allowing hints of the Land to leak out into the real world. Then he transports Covenant and Linden Avery to the Land. Only this time, the Land is sick. I won't say how or why, but the result is a very good, mildly depressing dark fantasy. Covenant is more accepting of the existence of the Land in this book, but Linden is thrown into confusion by it.This series is more her story than Covenant's. As Covenant was ill physically when he first entered the Land, Linden's wounds are on the inside, and she struggles with them throughout the trilogy. There's a lot of symbolism and allegory one can read into these books. Or one can just enjoy them as a story of a small group of people trying to restore a Land that once held joy, but is now the kind of place where a man would have to sacrifice his own family to feed a village. Good fantasy in a well-developed world."
4,A difficult read but a great book,"A great book, an unreserved 4 stars.On the ""difficult read"" point many reviewers keep in raising. I've always held the opinion that when writing use the simplest and clearest language of conveying your ideas - so do not use uncommonly used or difficult world when they can be avoided. I've always associated an author who uses difficult words as an intellectual snob.In this regard the 2nd Chronicle is a lot worse that the 1st, it seems like Donaldson has swallowed a thesaurus.Just for the amusement of all here are a few Donaldson classics:Why use ""Celerity"" when you could use ""Speed"".Why use ""Mien"" when you could use ""Expression"".Why use ""Filigree"" when you could use ""Delicate Pattern""And...Why the use ""Tintinnabulation"" when you could use ""ringing of bells""!?!"
4,Slan,"I heard that this book was a classic science fiction tale so I decided to give it a try. There is action, mystery and romance all wrapped into one fun story. With an unexpected ending that will make you want to re-read this classic again and again. A definate keeper!"
3,SOFTCOVER VERSION OF SLAN LIKE SATURDAY MATINEE SERIAL,"This is, as another reviewer suggested, like watching an old film serial: very melodramatic, overwritten and, like all Van Vogt, not about characters. Characters are always subservient to ideas in Van Vogt. He builds a character for half the book only to dispose of them. Why? Because they're not what the book is about. Van Vogt has bigger fish to fry, larger themes to explore: world domination, war, man's inhumanity, atomic power and space travel all rank above his characters and their fate. For those who are more interested in characters than ideas this can be disappointing. Know that going in and you'll enjoy a great read."
3,Weak Characterizations a la The X-Men,"I bought this book from amazon.com because of the popular opinion that it was one of the classics of the golden age of science fiction. I was very disappointed. Why didn't they print it in the smaller and cheaper standard paperback format? But I digress. I thought the book's major flaw was the characterizations. Even the protagonist is two-dimensional and there isn't one decent human being in the whole novel. As an anthropological sci-fi novel, its threadbare compared to LeGuin's Left Hand of Darkness. The whole idea of goal-oriented evolution that the book bases its premise on is ridiculous and has been repeatedly invalidated by science. The book has some redeeming qualities - there are several surprising plot twists. But it's strictly a book to check out at your local library."
2,Dated novel,"Unlike all of Van Vogt's other SF novels, this one has too much 1940's science, and the plot is simple with a Deus ex Machina ending.It was Van Vogt's first novel, and it shows his immaturity.If you like Van Vogt, it's worth reading once. But it's not a keeper."
3,Whats the fuss about,"Tale about repressed group fighting another group derived from them, who live with humans who repress both groups, but is run by a member of the repressed group, but none of the humans know it. So confusion rules.Lot of action so half the time I was not sure how they got to be in such situations anyhow.I suppose it does deal with eugenics, and the fact that evolution happens regardless.For the time it was written it must have been innovative.Rather dated today."
2,Listed as history but it is a novel,Somehow this site listed this book as history but it is a so so written novel.
2,Great watch...so-so HRM,"I love the watch... I wear it everyday and I think the features, the comfort, and the style are all exceptional.The HRM function makes me sad... I really wanted this to work better to be able to use to train with. Problem is, that the wireless connection ""drops"" too frequently and if you don't notice it and reset it, you lose that data.. so it really doesn't work for it's intended purpose.I too have replaced the transmitter battery, but it didn't help.Love the watch.... but it is just not a reliable HRM....If you need a watch by a watch... if you need a reliable HRM look elsewhere."
1,Broken belt in 6 months,This was great till the belt gave away after 6 months of use. Only if the product had a more durable belt. Gave my watch away to my 5 yr old. Out to spend another 100 bucks looking for a replacement watch.
2,not good to swim,"I specifically bought this watch to swim with it, but the lap button for some reason doesn't work well, and sometimes to be able to count the lap I have to press it hard and several times, which makes me even stop my training."
1,"Started out as a good watch, but keep it out of the water","One would think that a watch for an Ironman would function reasonably well in water. After just two months, the watch had condensation inside, which made it difficult to read, then finally stopped working altogther. I would recommend this watch for use on dry land only."
1,Only as a Watch,It did work for three days... After that I never got a reading from the belt. I changed the battery twice just to try everything.A disappointment.Search in Internet there are many complaint about the watch.
2,"good watch, bad transmitter band","I liked everything about this watch- easy to read, great price. Then the transmitter strap seperated at the joint between the main transmitter and the electrodes, making the unit worthless. Replacement band costs nearly as much as the entire unit. What good is a replaceable trasmitter battery if the strap breaks after 6 months. I replaced it with a Polar F6. It cost more, but if it lasts one year I'll be money ahead (plus it has a two year warranty). If it doesn't, replacement bands for the Polar are much easier to find, and cheaper."
1,Not as advertised,"the watch features are great, but I could not get it to read my heart rate. I have contacted Timex and they have sent me another watch, still no heart rate. Now they are sendind me another chest strap, this is two weeks after I purchased it. I don't think tha I shoudl be having this many problems with a new product. havein said that the customer service is great and they offer a cheap 5 year warranty for an additional $5. If the new strap does not work I am going to buy a Polar RS 100"
1,"Great watch, Read the Manual for Changing Sensor Battery!","I've always used Timex watches and like them a lot. This was my first heart rate monitor watch. After about 9 months the heart monitor sensor started giving anomalous readings to the watch. I washed the leads, changed the battery, tried everything, but it wouldn't work. I finally read the manual and noticed where it says when you change the sensor strap battery, you have to push the reset button just above the battery with the battery in. I did that and it worked great. Wonder how many others had a similar issue but didn't read the manual to push the reset button after changing the battery in the sensor. You have to use a paper click, small screw driver, or similar to push it in; it's just above the battery.I gave this a '1' before I found the issue, and want to change it to a '4' now, but I cannot change it after the fact..."
3,"Just enough to get you started, but lacking.","Easy to set up, but pain to operate.Small buttonsDoes not track heart rate unless it is operating in chrono or timer mode.Does not track heart rate across multiple zones/times in each zone. You must choose a zone before you start and track only in that one.Heart rate sensor belt is not sized for people w/ 46 chest or larger. I have it opened as much as possible and it is still tight.Easy to read and semi-intuitive. I like the review and timer functions.For just a little more money, I should have opted for the Polar F7. I settled for this one and now I'm stuck with it."
1,Where is it?,"I would love to tell you about this piece of electronics, but I haven't received it from the ""month and half ago"" order I placed. I am just wanting to know where it is? Impatiently waiting..."
2,band-aid,"I don't have this exact watch, but I have an ironman of the same style (lacks the heart monitor). There are two faults:1.) The way the band attaches to the watch body is weak. Mine held for about 6 months before the band detached from the watch body. I have not been able to re-seat the band to the watch body.2.) There is no rim to protect the watch face from scratching.Shame, because I like the watch:* open, breathable, and fast drying quality of the band* the large digits (easy to read under water)But even 2 stars is much for a watch that had a 6mo lifespan. Perhaps others will have better luck with the band.HTH"
4,"Great alternative to APC batteries, but connectors didnt fit","Bought this for an APC 2200 SmartUps. Was listed as supported, but didn't fit out of the box. Had to change out the connectors on the batteries. Otherwise great product."
2,"Caveat emptor - No ""On Denoting""","I generally agree with everything other favorable reviewers have said about what you will find in this book, especially regarding the fact that it is written as much for the lay reader as for the professional. But, the book, at least the Kindle edition, has one glaring omission. The blurb published by Amazon advocating the book says that it includes Russell's famous 1905 artice in ""Mind"" entitled ""On Denoting"". It is considered the most important philosophical article of the 20th century. It is NOT in this book. I checked the Table of Contents before buying and did not find it, but I bought it anyway, thinking that it may have been renamed.It is simply not there. For the non-professional, the book still has value, but as an inexpensive source for this famous article, the book misses the mark."
4,Very good introduction to modern epistemology,"As others have commented, this is a very good introduction to the basic topics of philosophy from a great 20th century philosopher. Russell focuses almost entirely on epistemology in this book, offering a thorough grounding of the most fundamental issues of human knowledge. The writing is very clear and straightforward in a way that is good for both the philosopher and general public. I couldn't have dreamed of a better writing style for such a book topic.I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 because the focus is pretty much entirely on epistemology and I feel Russell does not discuss metaphysics or ethics as much as he could have. But don't let that discourage you...this book is valuable to the philosophical newcomer."
4,The Problems of Philosophy,"This book is compulsory reading to anyone studying Philosphy, it is written in such a style as to take away the mysteke normally associated with the subject. Anyone can read this book and gain an understanding.Dr. Wallace Devlin, Ph.D"
2,A lot to Chew On,"I am just an occaisional, informal reader of philosophy. I would rate this book two stars, less because of it's content and perhaps more because of my own shortcomings. I found many of the chapters verbose and hard to follow. To be honest, I've found that I am more interested in short snippets of what major philosophers had to say rather than delve into their thoughts myself. When I try, I often find I don't have the attention span to follow what an author is saying, and that is what I found here. Having said that, I will add that I found the last two chapters more interesting. All in all, I would say this book is more tuned to serious lovers of philosophical questions than a casual reader such as myself."
3,THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY,"GREAT REFERENCE WORK. YOU SHOULD HAVE MORE OF THESE TYPE ON LINE FOR HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE OR GRADUATE STUDENTS TO ACCESS."
5,Russsell is Brilliant,This is an extremely thought provoking book. It touches on some of the most perplexing problems that need to be dealt with in philosophy today.
2,It dosent work with PS2 as described.,Im not casting aspersions toward the seller but the fact is this controller has never worked with games it claims it will work with.I have searched everywhere I can think of for any other directions on how to program this controller but the options are limited & so this unit is worthless as a PS2 controller.
2,Too big for my car,"Too big for my car. The microphone is way too big and hard to install. I will prefer a headset next time. Note: The size of this car kit is just like a fist. Before you buy it, remember to check your car by placing your fist near the car plug and try whether it will stick your car transmission or not."
1,Random personality test for the price of a book?,"The only thing that made me buy this book is its packaging -- the publisher cleverly made this seem like a fantastic ""game"" that somehow bears a great, amazing secret...It's no fun game at all. What the book offers is a very simple personality test -- that one gets in [...] or Cosmo Girls or from one of those obnoxious chain e-mails. [...] bucks? Totally not worth it. At all."
3,Book,This book is ok. Wish I had gotten it from the library instead of buying it. But I love books and I just passed it on to a friend. It is a fun book.
2,It is only fun the first time.,This is the kind of book you only read once. After that it mystique ruined. Good book to bring to a party.
3,"Great game, but you don't need the book.","I learned of the cube from a friend, who helped me through the exercise. I have done it for myself and for friends multiple times since. ""Knowing the secret"" (which frankly I think is a ridiculous way of putting it) only ruins it for you if you believe it does. Don't limit yourself, you can play this game again and again. As you change, your answers may change too, giving you new insight into yourself and your path. I do think it is a much more organic experience to do the cube person to person, rather than using the book. Just like reading Tarot is better without referring to the manual. I wish you peace and harmony on your journey."
1,waste of money,"They ask about 4 questions in the beginning of the book; and then spend the other 300 pages babbling on and on about them. Surprisingly, the descriptions they offered in those 300 pages rarely met with my answers. So, unless I feel like doing some serious soul-searching over 4 questions, I was out of luck on it providing ANY insight at all.Either my imagination is completely idiosyncratic, or they just couldn't find space during those 300 pages to put proper answer keys. My vote is the latter.Don't waste your money on this. Try Kokology books instead."
1,"To call this a ""book"" is an overstatement","The book is based on a mind game, which I won't spoil here (out of respect for the reader, not for the benefit of the authors). However, don't be fooled by the 200-something page count. The authors use about 30-40 words per page, as if they are writing poetry, and the entire trick can be described in 10 pages maximum, including commentary. Granted, the game itself is neat and can be used as an icebreaker, but you don't need this so-called ""book"" to learn a tale that belongs in the public domain. Overall, this is a waste of money and shelf space."
4,Not bad,The info is full and interesting. It gets boring as you read so I suggest that you learn it slowly and take time to digest and practise.
4,It is an excellent and creative book.,This book explores your imagination . It is a great game to play with your family and friends - they'll likely enjoy it if they have an imagination!!
5,One Of Their Masterpieces,Steelhouse Lane's debut album Metallic Blue is one of the 90s melodic rock masterpieces. They got attention since Slave Of The New World was selected as #1 melodic rock release of 1999 by melodicrock com. and Rock Report which are the major sources for music fans who like Journey styled rock.Some of you who are already familiar to this genre may notice that many of the tracks were used for other great 90s melodic rock bands. The first track Metallic Blue is used for House of Lords track and Dr. Love is used for Double Eclipse a master piece album by Hardline in early 90s.Whichever album you start you will end up buying both because both albums are of decade best quality.If you like guitar-driven rock such as Night Ranger or Survivor you will love this album.
3,Weak Neubauten Showing; not for First-Timers,"This is an OK album if you're already a Neubauten fan; however, it's a very VERY weak intro to the band. Go get Haus der Luge or Halber Mensch instead. In the meantime, if you MUST buy this album, at least save yourself some agony and go directly to ""Der Schact von Babel."""
5,"My comment on ""Theatres of Oakland"" just about covers it, but...","I have to say that Mr. Tillmany's book on San Francisco theatres finishes in a dead heat with the one about Oakland's theatres.It was very hard to put down, once I started, so I didn't...put it down, that is. Cover to cover in one night, the same with the Oakland book, I kept thinking, ""just one more page, and then I'll turn out the light and go to sleep."" I rarely lie to myself like that, but I didn't regret going through the book in one sitting.It's a valuable reference that will find a prominent place in my library and gather a lot less dust than most of my other books.--Preston Allison"
2,Low-budget endeavor,"Good enough, but photo's are poorly reproduced on inferior paper, book is small, cheaply printed and author neglected to provide an index..."
4,An interesting soundtrack,"I remember Das Boot as an isolated work. Can you imagine at the last hard years of Cold War, a West German production bassed on a submarine at the Atlantic Battle?No matter the film, its soundtrack has very interesting features. The 80's are supposed to be like a lost decade in many musical ways. The nowadays critics disguise the syntetizer... lets say at 100%.So, a lot of years after i saw this film, I notice a lot of great elements at this soundtrack. And of course, I could consider it at an isolated film music, that can show anybody that 80's weren't lost years in every sense or for everybody. There's no easy way to find an european epic music score at that time... or in any time. I guess it is inspired in Vaugham Williams's Antartic Symphony, originally written for the movie ""Scott of the Antartic"".It's not low budget, by the way."
4,A must for ant fan of Natacha Atlas,It's not like previous albums. It is more new age and ambiun. I love it. Natacha has a voice that sounds good doing any kind of music
1,Avoid this PLEASE,"First off, Natacha is a WONDERFUL artist in every regard. However, I still say avoid this CD.Yes, this CD is a departure from her more traditionally Arabic themed music. But the collection doesn't work. I'd rather listen to Enigma, Lisa Gerrard, Delerium, etc. for this genre. Natacha doesn't cut it.Go for Gedida or Something Dangerous...two of her best!"
5,Christmas music at its best,"You will love the variety on this CD. The one of a kind Exultate sound will never become tiresome to listen to.I have just recently discovered this amazing group and plan on attending every concert I can. Lucky for you, you can get the CD,s and enjoy the same wonderful music."
5,Luxurious,If you like fine things you will appreciate this sketchbook. It just feels good in your hand. Sixty pages with the standard pocket in the back. These books are for a lifetime.
5,A great cleaning kit for handguns,This I believe is one of the best cleaning kits available the snap-n-pull system makes it a snap to change to different ends on the cleaning rod.
1,waste of money,I bought this for my daughter to practice on for hockey but she never got to use it. I had the ground completely leveled and this thing was still uneven! Theres no way this could possibly work with just plastic. Save your money and build one yourself the right way. A complete rip off and disappointment!!
5,The single best book on the subject,"This is, in my judgment, the single best book on the subject of the proper role of religion in the politics of a liberal democracy. If that subject interests you, there is no better place to begin than with this book."
2,Save your money,"The laser line is just not precise enough for most work. Squaring the tape measure to the board you're working on is not accurate enough to produce a nice square laser line. I was off by an eight of an inch within a foot of the tape measure. I could use another tape measure to square the laser line but then, what's the point. Just make a mark with the second tape measure or just buy a laser line square. If you just want a laser line projector, you could use this unit for that purpose and that's why I gave it two stars instead of one."
3,Uninteresting,"This is a fine recording, but will probably disappoint fans of the Michael Brecker/Mike Stern/Don Grolnick era. It's good to see Mike Manieri is continuing the Steps Ahead tradition, but the recent recordings have lacked the creativity and the, well, ""stepping ahead"" elements of the earlier years."
4,Good CD- But not their best work,"I really like this CD, it has some great tunes, but after having my socks blown off by both ""Ying-yang"" and ""NYC"" (some of the best CD's I own) I was a little let down."
4,An Intimate Glimpse,"Anyone who has ever been in a love relationship will recognize some aspect of it in this, Liz Reed's third album. From that wrenching feeling that I can't stand this situation anymore but I can't bear to let it go in ""Sometimes I Just Cry,"" to the gutsy power of ""Tell Me,"" all the way to the end and the fresh freedom in ""Another Highway Song."" But the words are only the beginning. Liz has an unforgettable pure soprano voice that can bring tears to your eyes, and while her own guitar work is certainly adequate, she has put some talented friends to work on instrumental and vocal accompaniments. There is greater range and variety in this album than most new artists are able to muster. Everyone will have a favorite song, and yours will be different from mine. And while she has to warn us about the ""explicit lyrics,"" this is by no means the focus. Even her mother forgives the stray expletive if it makes the point crystal clear."
3,Different but to Jewel Esque,"I think that the Alanis, and Jewel days are over and she copies them way to much. I saw her live and she was just okay."
2,Music is offensive,"Although there is a bit of evidence of raw talent in Liz Reed's voice, her explict lyrics are certainly not needed. They have really made me think twice about, and even regret buying this cd. Perhaps there are more intelligent or intellectual ways of getting your feelings across."
5,More please!!,"I found out about the Chauvet cave and this book in the gift shop of another French cave with cave paintings (Font du Gaume). The idea of being within arm's reach of cave paintings was fairly overwhelming. Then to see the book on Chauvet and the paintings found there! What an amazing day!Looking through this book is a constant joy. The paintings were made by a true artist. They are magnificent. If you have an interest in cave paintings, this is the book for you. It is an excellent record of what has been found in the cave to date.I do wish for more expository text but that will come with more study of the paintings, handprints, footprints and other artifacts found in the cave.Until then, I will have to be content to look at beautiful photographs of some of the most amazing art work ever seen."
2,Worked for sometime with too much headache,"I used this product few years ago to stream music from iPod 4th gen. It worked well for sometime but started giving trouble after few months.1. Everytime i have to go through hard way of establishing a connection with the base station. I have to keep pressing the connect button several times by keeping the iPod attached with the sending device.2. the iPod connector was made up of poor plastic and design. The start button was stuck up inside after few months and I was never able to stop the device again unless i put some small pin to push it up.Overall, cheap product. Don't waste your money.I was never been a happy customer with Logitech products. I also purchased thier universal remote and it stopped working after sometime.Logitech, a very less reliable brand! stay away from thier products."
3,Good product,"I had been waiting for a product like this one for some time. It puts your entire music collection into the palm of your hand, and transmits the sound to your stereo. The performance far surpasses any FM transmitter, and works up to 30 ft from your stereo.For $150, it is a bit pricey, but still worth it for me. As stated before, the sound quality is very good will little to no interference...worlds better than an FM transmitter...Downsides....the peice that fits into the top of the Ipod is adjustable for either the full ipod, or the mini (by way of a sliding headphone jack), but lacks that little peice that goes into the smaller jack next to the headphone jack. because of this, the adapter spins around and doesn't feel like it is stable on top of your ipod. Other downside is that the adapter has its own battery source (does not draw power from ipod), which results in having to charge yet another item at your house.All in all, it delivers on it's promise, just a couple of nuisances..."
4,Useful device,"I was looking for something like this for more than a year, its simple easy to use and the most important thing WORKS WELL ! Good sound quality, no sound droping or gaps and I have tried it across doors and about 30 feet from base."
5,Real Scotland,"As an expat Scot, I find myself going back to this book when I start thinking about, and missing, Scotland. Eames is a fine writer and he describes, not only journeys he made in Scotland (around 1990), but a journey he made within himself, as he searched for a more secure sense of his own identity.His description of the land, the people,and the weather are as vivid, honest, and true as any I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Four Scottish Journeys takes me back to the country where I grew up in a way which is almost as real as being there."
5,Squarepusher's best as of yet,"I have this, Feed Me Weird Things and Rotted Note. This is without a doubt the best of the lps. I was relieved to hear its not much like Rotted Note (which I find horrid and nigh unlistenable). I like Feed Me alot, but this is a definite improvement on that. Great CD, if you like Aphex's RDJ check this out."
3,YES,"Another superb release by Tom,I think this release is ok it's no Go Plastic or Big Loada but I still like most of all Jenkinson's work so far. If you like decent music pick this up."
5,........,"I've had this album for a few years now,and all I can say is Tom Jenkinson is,in my view,a genius--and that's not a word i throw around lightly. When it first came out I'd never heard anything remotely like it. It's definitely maniacal,but that's what he was aiming for in the first place. But aside from that,he jumps around from one form of music to another--this is ADD under some semblance of control,and man,what beautiful things can come of that! As a musician you listen to him and can't help but be absolutely blown away; the guy's a virtuoso on everything,let alone the fact that you'd never imagine drum machines could be used in this way. To this day I still put it on occasionally,and I can't help but laugh my head off. It's been how many years since it came out,and still,no one can touch him. Easy listening this is NOT. but when you're in the mood for it,go ahead--put it on. God bless SquarePusher.Lastly,if you happen to like this,try to get your hands on the EP,Vic Acid. Brilliant."
3,"I own two, the size and thickness are great.","The extra large size is great. The mats are soft and slip free, but the surface is not meant for use with shoes. The surface works great for yoga, sit-ups, push-ups, etcetera. But if you need to wear shoes be careful because it will permanently wear away at the surface and leave ruts. Because of the product not living up to its durability claim I am only giving it 3 out of 5 stars. I was hoping to use this item for bootcamp training exercises like P90X, to keep my feet and legs from taking such a beating on my concrete flooring, but anything that requires shoes puts to much wear on these mats."
5,mat,"Nice thick mat, seems to be holding up, my shoes do leave shallow tears in the surface, but I'm not surprised, given how thick it is. Shipping was prompt, packaging appropriate. No complaints."
4,Very Functional,"Good product for the money. It's not as thick as some folks would like, yet this mat is very functional. The mat is also large enough for someone like myself, at 6'4"" and 240lbs. Recommended, indeed.BaldySmith[...]"
4,Excellent story telling,"I only rate this book a 4, because the first book in the series, ""The Frontiersman"" is the best, and I rated it a 5. But really, this book is great reading. The Black Hawk War is a story not told often, but like usual, Eckert tells it very well here and keeps the reader's interest all the way through.If your kid is bored with history, this series of books should make him not so bored."
2,Light years behind.,"Get the Klein electronic screwdrivers. These are hard to use with one hand. They have no grip at the front, and the rear doesn't sit in your hand very well."
5,A fantastic hold'em book for experienced players,"This is one of my favorite poker books. It is not for beginners; it is filled with interesting and advanced topics in limit Hold'em. This is a good book for any reader who is looking to read more advanced material. The section titled ""Do You Pass the Ace-Queen Test?"" was controversial when the book first came out, but Feeney's thoughts has proven to be correct. The Short-Handed essays are illuminating as well. Definitely a great addition to any hold'em library."
3,Six?,"I am confused. I just finished this book last night, but the name of the book was ""Six"", not ""Genesis"". My only experience with Crace, prior to this, was reading ""Being Dead"" and ""Signals of Distress"".Thankfully I read ""Being Dead"" first. If I had read either of the others, I would never have bought another Crace book. No comparison!"
4,Evolution of American Urban Society,Of what I have read of Chudacoff's book has been informative and detailed. It is a information packed book that often times jumps from one point to another. Some times the facts and dates get in the way of the point he is trying to get across but it is relatively an easy read if you do not let that bother you. The pictures are great and really share a look at life was like across America in the early stages of its development.
2,"Informative, but lacking in style and usefulness.","Prof. Chudacoff and Smith's book is concise in its discussion of events and personalities. In this sense it is an ideal _textbook_--but even though it is in its fifth edition it could use some editing! There are problems with textual flow and art, and in useful conclusions: saloons provided an outlet for ""the musical expression of the black soul."" Or how about the oft-mentioned but never defined or measured ""rugged individualism"" of Americans?"
4,A dynamic account of American Urban History,"Howard Chudacoff should be considered one of America's premier Urban Historians. Evolution of Urban Society provides an in-depth yet readable account of everyday life in Urban America. Organized by era, the concepts and problems of urban life are clearly presented."
1,Aboman didn't own a car,"This book covers ""civic emergencies, wilderness survival, home management, auto repair, food storage and health"". I find it odd that the text has been listed under a wilderness survival heading. At only 144 pages its wilderness survival focus is too terse to be compared to books of this genre.If you are looking for books on wilderness survival and want FOCUS in your text, try reading the US Army Survival Manual."
1,My Undergraduate Students Write Better Than This!,"I have a master's degree in neuroscience and I'm working on a Ph.D. I read difficult technical journal articles every day. Furthermore, I'm the coach of a top university cross-country ski team in Canada. The material in this book should not have been difficult for me. Yet I found this book almost completely inaccessible due to the author's inability to portray even the simplest of material in a clear and useful way.This book is abyssmal. The writing is poor, although I suspect that this might be due to poor translation. Worse, the figures are hopelessly confusing and unhelpful. Many of the graphs lack units or labels on the axis. Absolutely none of the figures have captions and the body of the text rarely explains them. Literally pages of raw data is reported, and it was hard to distinguish between real measurements and theoretical or stylized data in the figures and graphs.I strongly recommend that you seek an alternative to this resource."
4,Practical reference,Great book that offers good practical advice. Will be keen to put into practice.
2,Inconsistent,"One minute training is being based on max heart rate, the next it's based on your lactate threshold. There are just too many contradictions throughout the book."
1,cranberry tea,"Describing this material as ""cranberry tea"" seems unfortunate. It is merely bitter black tea with a few shreds of something not definable. Perhaps I should have realized from the picture that it would have no cranberry flavor or scent and ordered the cranberry-apple instead. I will return it to the company and they can compost it, because that is its only value. Laurence"
1,doesn't work for me,"I am a long-time fan of both Elvis Costello and Bill Frisell. At their best, both artists can be phenomenal. But they do have bad moments, and I'm sorry to say this disk is is situated in that portion of the Venn diagram in which disappointing performances overlap. After repeated listening sessions in which I tried really hard to appreciate this, I finally gave up. Costello just sounds self-absorbed, self-indulgent and (frequently) strained (more-so than usual). Frisell is laid back throughout -- almost to the point of being absent. It is a live disk, and even the audience doesn't quite seem to know whether to applaud."
3,Frisell + Costello = Good,"With respect to another review on this album, i initially felt the response: too much costello, not enough frisell. Upon second thought, however, i opine: costello and frisell fit well, and for those of us who are familiar with frisell, he takes a decidedly back seat role. in the end, of course, frisell is preferrable to costello, so this cd should not be pursued by frisell fans; costello fans, as other reviews mention, will not want the album, because costello does nothing to add to frisell's playing. It is nice to see, however, that costello has some taste in music in performing with frisell; too bad he can't pull it off (see his more recent work with bacharach for confirmation). Nonetheless, if you are are fan of mellow, jazz-inflected vocal tunes, where costello is the vocalist, it ain't that bad. If you are lucky, you'll discover frisell, and, well, so much for costello."
1,Michigan Rivet Bankruptcy,"In February, 2006, the new owner of Michigan Rivet Corp. led the company (renamed MRC Industrial Group) into Involuntary Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and dissolution of the company."
5,i'm allergic to dust but i still bought it.,"On the outside a stranger to Neil Gaiman's work might think the Sandman covers represent nonsense,despite the seriousness of the tone.But they're just like the lyrics of a Nirvana song,they have deep and thoughtful subliminal messages in them. Dust Covers tells all about it by the authors.Yeah,the covers do look pretty without the logo and the other features in them(last sandman story! )were cool. Consider this much more than a companion."
4,"Gorgeous images, okay text","Lots of great images and info about Mary Kelly's important but hard to find art. It's a pity the texts aren't better. The interviewer (Douglas Crimp) embarrassingly doesn't seem to know much about Kelly's work, and the critical takes aren't really new or deep.Overall, the new Phaidon series is beautifully-produced, but not really up to the standards the series once set, when it published more significant critical work and scholarhsip. These feel like candies: quick reads, nice pix, but nothing too deep and certainly nothing critical."
2,Lot of problems with windows xp,I have had this drive for couple of years. It is very unpredictbale with windows xp.. doesnt get recognized. I'm getting frustrated now. Probably there was a windows update that broke windows 1.1 usb driver..Beware..all the windows xp users out there..
1,Terrible hard drive - BSOD in windows 2k,"This drive has terrible problems installing and running in a windows 2000 environment. The company offers little to no support. The product worked for a while in a stable production environment, then one day it started blue screening the computer, and it has not worked since, in its original system, or three others wher installation was attempted. It may be that a recent MS windows update broke the USB 1.1 drivers, but right now the drivers are continously being recognized improperly as a scsi device."
4,Fast paced book!,"Annie Spooner had no idea that when her group conducted the annual seance to summon King Richard the Third he would appear to them ... ALIVE! However, an amulet he wore for protection had cast Richard from the 15th century to the 21st century when he was in danger. But Richard was not yet king when he was zapped forward. His brother, Ned, was. Then his brothers, Ned and George, were sent to the 21st century by the Grand Wizbar, followed later by Elizabeth!Dorothy, Annie's friend, was making a movie about King Richard the Third. Richard changed the script in an attempt to rewrite history. A nosy reporter, ""Babbling Brooke"", got involved too. Soon all three members of the royal family were losing their hearts to three extra ordinary women!When the 15th and 21st century clash things get amusing fast! This is a swift paced book that, if you keep your mind of who's who, is full of wit and will keep you smiling as you read!"
1,History buffs beware!,"The only praise that can be given to the author of this book is her original idea to take characters from history and put them in a new situation, intead of sticking with the unmovable plot and re-writing actual events as ""history with dialog"", as the genre of historical fiction has been called. But that is the ONLY praise that can be given. This book was so silly and badly written that I had to force myself to finish it. I avidly read anything Richardian but I would advise any history buff to just say no to this novel."
4,Great Insight into Baseball,"This is a fantastic book on baseball that was ahead of its time. A couple of interesting historical points emerge from these pages. First, there is the link between Will's profile of La Russa and the A's and Michael Lewis' later look at Billy Beane in ""Moneyball."" Second, there is the fact that, of the individuals he profiles, only Orel Hershiser never really became Hall of Fame caliber (while Gwynn and Ripken did). Third, there is Will's use of Bill James' stats and insights, which has become commonplace among younger baseball writers. This is a great read during the cold months of winter."
4,"Basic enough, even for me.","As a person who likes baseball but is nothing more than an avid fan I found this book great. I like the game but just don't know much about it. This book was basic enough for me to get and (more importantly) stay in. I have come across books that get so loaded down with data that I couldn't get through them. Will's book DOES give plenty of hard data but it was still able to keep my enjoyment level up. If you want to learn more about the ins and outs of baseball, this is a great book to start with because it also gives a number of different perspectives from a number of key positions in the game."
4,"Bad Politcs, Good Insight","Picking players such as Orel Hershiser, Tony Gwynn, and Cal Ripken Jr to analyze made the book extremely enjoyable for me as two out of three of them were players I was able to regularly watch. All three of them were players with high integrity and strong character. Had Will chosen the Albert Belle and Roberto Alomar types of characters to highlight, I would have never bought the book.Will dissected the game of baseball down to it's intimate points that are easy to forget when watching the game (especially on TV). I wish he could eliminate his political bias and long-windedness while sticking to his sports topic. There were times in the book when I felt like I was reading excerpts from some Republican campaign manager."
1,Dumb,"Mr. Will, what you've just wrote is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent book were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone who read your book is now dumber for having read it. I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul."
5,a classic to be enjoyed by generations to come,"This extraordinarily written masterpiece provides the reader with an insider look at our national pastime. Will writes with an educationally objective, yet personal style that grabs you from page 1. I didn't want to finish it; I wanted more. Will, like the men he features, is a master of his craft. A must read."
4,"Outdated, But Fascinating Nevertheless","This somewhat outdated book (written in late '80s) is an ambitious compendium of the skills employed by some of the best players and managers of the game. Through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, Orel Hershiser, Tony Gwynn and Cal Ripken Jr., Will fees us a Herculean amount of ""inside baseball."" Perhaps the boatload of statistics and anecdotes are a little too weighty, but Will leavens it with his wit and his solid journalism. Maybe a good baseball fan doesn't need to know all that Will gives us. But as a former baseball fanatic who lost interest for decades, I found it very enjoyable to take a refresher course in the ins and outs of our national pastime and be reminded why I love the game so much. A solid, notable baseball book by a devoted fan."
3,Educational but Stiff,"George Will turns his focus to baseball's technicalities through the eyes of pros like Tony Gwynn, Cal Ripken, Tony LaRussa, etc. The result is an educational look at pitching, catching, managing, defense, and other facets of the national pastime circa 1990. These pages provide valuable insight seldom covered by the oft-trivial sportswriting that rarely examines strategy. These pages provide insight for hardcore fans, students of the game, coaches, players, etc. Unfortunately, Will's thick prose makes for rather stiff reading - perhaps he should stick to political columns, where his prose at least, is much better. Hardcore fans might enjoy this book, but could be better directed towards BASEBALL FOR BRAIN SURGEONS by Tim McCarver, and Roger Kahn's HEAD GAME (about pitching)."
3,"Information +, Style -","Will includes tons of fascinating insights and anecdotes, but the writing is ponderous. He seems unable to be agile in explaining anything. Statistics are frequently presented in far more volume than necessary to prove the point in question. There are misspellings and sentences which simply do not scan. This book seems to have lacked a strong, intervening editor. The result is a book at least 30% longer than it needs to be. In addition, although its 4 stars are still active in baseball, a great deal has changed since then including interleague play, smaller parks, the big home run totals, the even greater importance of the closer, the money -- this book is in big need of an update. It's also surprising that he never really addresses free agency. If he were writing it today, he would need to discuss salary cap and realignment."
2,Makes growing grass seem fast paced.,"Simply too much categorical, mind numbing data (that isn't actually used on a game-by-game basis) to maintain any sort of interest. If it were a book on chess problems then it may have made sense to break down sooooo many possible variables, but it's not; it's a book loosely based on Will's belief of how the game should really be viewed and it makes osmosis seem exciting.As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception. I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing."
3,Typical George Will - For Better and Worse,"As a long time fan of the game, I appreciate insights new to me, especially in the La Russa section. However, in typical George Will fashion, he completely ignores the big issues in order to make his point on minor ones. For example, on hitting, he totally misses the importance of power. It's not that 50 HR w/ 150 SO and 50 BB is ideal, it's that 40 HR + 120 BB and a mediocre batting average leave Gwynn on the second team.On the other hand, what can you expect from a man who thinks that the First Amendment guarantees that the the paid speech of corporate lobbyists displaces the free speech of citizen constituents?"
5,Men at Work,"This book was recommended to me, but I have not had an opportunity to read it. The book arrived quickly and in fine condition."
2,Had I only known. . .,"As a rule, I find most of Mr. Will's writings to be interesting; even insightful. . . Unfortunately to all rules, there must be an exception.I picked up the book thinking that Will would be able to answer questions about the game and it's inner workings. How very disappointing.I was unaware that baseball could be made less interesting than it already is."
5,Men At Work,The quintesential book on baseball. Insights of the game told by an author who understands the game within the game. A must read for all serious fans.
2,George Will can't write!,"The book does provide some very interesting stories and the premise of the book is a good one, but George Will somehow manages to mess it up. I found the book to be very incoherent, jumping from one thing to the next with little, if any, transition. The book has everything, except good writing. I never thought I would say that about George Will, but it is true."
2,"Verbose,overrated","there is a tendencey among well educated baseball fans to make this great game out to be more then it is. George Will is an extreme example of this. Much of this is overwritten,and overblown which is too bad, beacause the subjects written about{cal Ripken, Tony Gwynn and the overrated-underrated Tony La Russa}are quite interesting,though Mr Will turns this book, somehow into a polemic on American values,thereby losing any credibility. Strange. A far,far better example of baseball wriitng exists in Thomas Boswells collections or anything by Roger Angel. This is the equivalent of a $2,000,000 a year utility infielder:overpaid and not worth the money."
2,Flowery Prose Masks Fundamental Flaw,"George F. Will is better than just about any other author I know in using flowery prose to mask what I consider to be his biggest problem; namely, his failure to communicate with readers and hold their interest.Instead of being the insightful and introspective look into the game of baseball its author hoped for, it comes across as pretentious and muddled. While I love baseball, I found this book to be inane and boring.As far as I'm concerned, ""Men at Work"" represents Will's swing at a 3-2 outside pitch. I hope he never writes a book about golf. Pass on this one."
2,Outdated...,"Should be RE-titled ""Men At Work: In The Late 80's"" There are some interesting tidbits but overall this book has not aged well. About as useful as an outdated textbook. Not recommended."
5,quick delivery!,This product came quickly. It was as described. Thank you for the book and sorry it took so long for the feedback.Trust this seller.~R~
1,Give me a break!,"If you're looking for a good baseball read, look further. The absolute twerpiness of George Will comes across in this book. It's clear that when he was a youngster, he was the nerdy kid in the schoolyard. This is the typical example of a pinheaded intellectual trying to sound like an average Joe by writing about sports. Give me a break George Will!"
3,TOUGH BOOK TO WADE THROUGH,"I am not sure I know much more about the Clovis culture than I did before reading the book. I even read the conclusions twice to try to 'get it' and since there is so little evidence as to who Clovis people were, where they came from, how they lived, etc. there is very little to conclude. It's like putting together a 1000 piece jig saw puzzle with 200 pieces. You think you know what the final jigsaw puzzle should look like, but you just ... don't ... know .... for sure.I would not recommend this book for a reader who wants to read something from cover to cover. This is a sleeper. IMO, it is a book to back up research or knowledge on Clovis in small dosages."
2,Attack of the establishment,"The info and analysis on the Clovis period is pretty good. However, the emphasis on the ""authoritative"" position that the Clovis people were the first settlers in the face of a tremendous quantity of mounting evidence that Homo sap. settled North and South America at least 20,000 years before Clovis, greatly detracts from the value of the book."
2,The Early Settlement of No. America,a lifeless story ... a chore to wade through ... I wonder how it turns out.
1,This was a complete waste of my time and money,Don't bother. The students can make their own books and have better quality. I have not used them with my students because I do not want to waste my copies.
5,Don't think twice about buying this CD!,"Jeremy and Jesse will turn non-celtic music lovers into diehard fans. I've seen them entertain a crowd and they give a captivating performance that makes you smile and dance at the same time. If you can listen to this CD without at least tapping your toe to the beat, consult a physician, because there's something dreadfully wrong with you. Seriously,though,this is good stuff,especially from college-age musicians. Buy it for yourself and enjoy the energetic jigs, reels and emotional airs that literally weep from Jeremy's fiddle.It's awesome traveling music for the car and children of all ages enjoy it as well."
3,Not as good as his other stuff,"I love love love Jeremy Kittel - I have all of his CDs that I could track down... I just think his newer outputs like ""Chasing Sparks"" are so much better."
5,The classic work on Jewish humor,This is the definitve work on all of the old Jewish stories and/or jokes which your parents knew. A must have
4,Fair to Middlin',"There are quite a lot of quoted definitions, but it does have great illustrative readings, and good suggestions for internet searches. Also offers statistics that are helpful to know."
1,amazon did their job-but this book sucks,"Amazon shipped the right book and it was on time. This book, choosen by the teacher/school/subject is really dry and boring. It rambles on about a simple idea for pages upon pages. it is easy enough to read, just boring."
1,Talking in Circles,"This book is as clear as mud. I read this book to better understand alternative paradigms that are all too often missing from others on this subject. Unfortunately, the author focused more on including everyone's perspective than making any idea clear."
1,Save your money-rent it,"I had to purchase this book for my MSW program. Unfortunately, since the book was just released this year, there were no ""used"" copies available. This book is AWFUL!! By far the worst textbook I have ever had the misfortune of owning. It's so bad I can't even force myself to read it. Schriver (repeatedly) talks about the origins of words [who cares] and lists 3-4 definitions for each one. ""Smith says it's this.... whereas Jones defines it as..."" and so on. Pick one already! Rent it if you can. Not worth owning."
2,Could be improved considerably,"Schriver's is a text whose reach exceeds its grasp. The theoretical premise and the structure for the text are good. Schriver argues that there are biases in traditional approaches to various systems and that alternative paradigms exist. However, the writing is often dense. The classification of some theories as ""traditional"" vs ""alternative"" can be disputed. Many theories seem to have characteristics of both. On a positive note, many of the readings included in the text are very interesting.As a faculty member who has used the book in a BSW course, I find that I need to guide students through this text. I distribute a guide to each chapter. Essentially I ""translate"" Schriver with more concrete examples. Other texts I have use require fewer translations. Schriver's focus is perhaps too sophisticated for the average undergraduate."
2,DRY,I find this text to be extremely dry reading.... I usually enjoy my SW texts... but not this one! I kind of wish the institution would consider using a different textbook.
1,Horrible! Awful! Awk!,"This is the first computer book I regret buying. It is the most useless use of paper I have ever seen. The author has no teaching ability and no skills at Poser. I had some prior experience using poser, and was hoping this book would fill-in the holes for me. Unfortunately, this ""guide"" creates far more questions than it answers. Mortimer merely instructs the user to play with the knobs until something utterly useless, and ugly has been created. Anyone with a moderate amount of computer experience doesn't need this, and anyone new to computers is far more likely to be scared by Mortimer's art than learn anything from it.I burnt my copy of this book camping, and no it isn't even very good at starting a camp fire. Crumpled newspaper works much better. And reading random bits of crumpled newspaper is far more likely to improve your Poser skills than this pile of garbage."
1,Absolute garbage...,"This book is a complete waste of money. Having owned Poser since version 1, I was looking for this book to contain in-depth data on advanced topics such as: Morph Targets, Textures, Grouping, etc...Well forget about it. This book breezes over these topics in a paragraph or two.Instead, the reader is treated to entire chapters on ""wacky animal creations"" or, as a previous reviewer wrote, turning the dials to make useless distortions.Please, until there is a writer who is intelligent and serious about the software, don't waste your money on this book and go online to get better information."
1,Don't bother,"The book is awful! The artwork is hideous, and the ""lessons"" are useless. Mr. Shamms Mortier is a con-artist, and every book he has written is scam. If you don't believe me, take a look at the reviews of other books he has written; he's left a trail of destruction behind him on Amazon. Thank goodness for free speech!Mortier's use of English in this book is extremely poor. His understanding of the Poser is extremely poor, and his understanding of how to teach is also extremely poor. What I can't understand is why any sane publisher would allow this man to write books. Poser 4 Handbook is basically a republishing of the online material, only more confusing (Shamms can't even plaguerize well). To anyone who wants to learn Poser 4, just read the online documentation for now, and maybe someday there will be a more useful book on Poser available."
1,Amazing!,"What is so amazing, well it's obviously not the book according to the one star I gave it. What is amazing is that Shamms is able to write one low quality book after another and still get publishers and people to buy his books. Some how he has been able to get away with writing over 20 different books with only the most basic knowledge and very brief experience of the programs. I would like to know how he pulls it off, I mean if he can write a book on Poser then I should easily be able to write a book on well, anything I know nothing about and still make money off it."
1,WHY?,"This book is filled with the childish scribblings of a total poser novice whose idea of testing the program was twiddling the knobs. Why anyone would buy a book that tells them to do something they probably already did before they bought the book is totally beyond me.My advice : go buy Richard Schrand's far superior book (Poser 4 Pro Pack f/x & Design) at least with that book you'll learn something, I did."
5,Bonus features alone make it a good value.,"When the original broadcast of the bonus feature ""Mars and Beyond"" was aired on ABC in 1957, Sputnik was the first man made satellite. Televisions were black and white, had 12 possible channels, and no solid state components. Yet there it was, a vision of a Mars landing vehicle almost identical to what became the Apollo lunar lander when Neil Armstrong stepped on the moon.In this same 1957 Disney feature, we learn why space exploration is important - ""over population and the consumption of Earth's limited resources"" make expansion beyond our planet a necessity.As a lesson in our capacity to imagine and create, and as a lesson in our ability to ignore unpleasant facts, this Disney show is a must see.Roving Mars itself is an enjoyable documentary. Ponder a bit on what humans are capable of. Find reason to be optimistic that we can solve incredible challenges if we put our minds to it."
2,Roving Mars,The title of this DVD is a bit misleading. I was expecting to see actual images of Mars as seen from the Mar's rovers. Granted a few actual images were displayed but nothing that couldn't be obtained on the net.The dvd largely concentrates on the planning of the rovers up to launch. Animation then takes over with the landing of the rovers and exploration of the surface.Non the less the Dvd is enjoyable with great attention paid to the accuracy of the animation. Obviously it could not be expected to see the actual landing and deployment of the rovers if it weren't by animation.If you are wanting to see real images of the Mars surface forget this DVd and wait until a Dvd comes out that does show the real images obtained from the rovers.
3,Not very long,This DVD is only about 40 minutes long.It is quite interesting with some nice simulations.HD picture quality is very good but some short partsof the 40 minutes are not in HD.At $20+ I think it is too expensive for what it is.I just rented it.
1,Pathetic!,"I bought this documentary thinking I was going to see images and footage of Mars from the two rovers during their explorations...however...99% of this documentary is COMPUTER ANIMATION! So very little of this ""documentary"" is actual images and footage from the rovers I can only say one thing. This documentary is PATHETIC! It runs slightly less than 40 minutes! If you followed the stories of Spirit and Opportunity in the news...then you've already seen more rover images from that source than what you will see in this documentary. AN EXTREMELY HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! Don't waste your money."
3,A little disappointing,"The concept is great, and you will learn a lot of great stuff about Mars and the voyages there. But the execution fails slightly to live up to the promise. It suggests that you'll feel like you're on Mars, and there's a bit of that, but most of it feels like computer-generated imagery more than actual footage, or the actual footage feels low-resolution. Somehow, it all manages to fail to coalesce into a real feeling of being there. The disc would be a solid disc on its own terms, but it just promises too much."
2,Too Costly For Such A Short,"All the Imax films are great as are quite a few independents, documentary's etc but for a 40min film it should be like $12.95, I don't care if its bluray or not. Blu ray better get their pricing structure in order or they'll never dominate."
2,Rent It First,"First of all I was disappointed not by the fact that there was very little scientific information like one of the reviewers but by the fact that there is almost no actual Mars footage! My guess is 60 percent is about the troubles of building the rovers, and then perhaps 35 percent is CG images of the rover landing on Mars, coming up to a rock, etc, and maybe only 5 minutes of this film (if that) actually contains any actual footage of the planet itself -- the real reason I wanted to watch this film! The movie that I would love to see is one without any narrator, but with just images capturing the sublime grandeur of space (in this case Mars) paired of with some kind of subtle music by someone like Brian Eno.That said, the CG images were nicely done, and some of the scenes of them building the rovers were interesting. My final advice, rent it first (I did) before you decide if you really want to buy it. I'm going to save my money for something else."
2,"ONLY 1 Battery, not as shown","I thought, per the photo, I'd be getting 2 batteries, but I got only one, for the price of 5 (yes other merchants are selling 5 packs for the same price). I hope it is worth the price, cz it certainly isn't worth returning"
3,Fluff!!!,"There wasn't anything wrong with this book. I liked the premise, I loved the name (Sebastian--ooh! la! la!), the writing was good. But, overall, the book for me was just fluff. It was a pleasant diversion for a few hours, but nothing that I will remember or make this one a keeper. I thought the idea that Seb was her protector was good, but I felt Lucy lacked something. I just couldn't get into her. And when her family showed up, it reminded me of the Darling family when they descended on Andy Griffith in Mayberry. Anyway, this book is an okay read. But, I doubt if it is one that will make its way onto very many keeper shelves."
5,Full bodied Marilyn Monroe,"Did any body ever really listen to her sing? Feminine, real, animated voice from a feminine, real, animated woman. Great songs, put together as though a movie was edited. Let's have more of this stuff. Marilyn LIVES!"
1,interesting...,"That's rare about cast (never again seen). It's the clone of the italian ""Trinità"" with Terence Hill and Bud Spencere.Technical quality is horrible."
3,Trinity take off.,Well made take off of the Trinity movies. Follows the origionals very well. Actors are unknown to me but at one time so were Tereence Hill & Bud Spencer. Watch it.
4,Parker Pyne is not a detective,"""Parker Pyne Investigates"" is the same book/set of short stories as ""Mr. Parker Pyne, Detective"" (the former being a slightly more accurate description of Mr. Pyne) As other reviewers have pointed out, these are SHORT stories, and include murder and other mysteries, but that is secondary to the theme of addressing unhappiness."
2,Not the usually brain teaser - pick it up only if u want to complete the Christie series,Short stories which are quick light read. No unexpected twists. Just simple sweet stories. Good for a light read before sleeping but not a book which hooks you.
3,"First half common, Great second half!","The first six stories about helping people to realize their own self-worth are too sentimental. The other stories in the book are much better. More like the Agatha Christie I loved to read. Murder, thief, and ,of course, a clever plot twists. I really like the different version of ""Death on the Nile."" So skip the first ones, and read the last six."
4,"Some ""Wonderful"" Moments","This is a very different album for Janis Ian. Never released in the U.S. If you read her 2008 autobiography ""Society's Child..."" you gain some insight that her personal life, and mental and physical health were undergoing difficult transitions when this album was recorded. ""Why Can't You and I?"" is standard, beautiful Ian at her best. ""Sniper of the Heart"" is a sped up revisit to the tango style of the 1977 ""Will You Dance"". The title track is scary, and honest. The album is very disco, as were other offerrings by her contemporaries at the time. ""Body Slave"" was made into a 12"" long version lp in Australia! Give it a try!"
1,Great if it worked,Installed this expansion and it caused random Sims 2 crashes. Looked the problem up on the internet and it was pretty common. Uninstalled and problems disappeared. I'm disappointed to say the least. I DON'T recommend this expansion.
5,Love going on trips!,"I am in love with the sims franchise, ever since sims 2 and the ability to go on vacations and honeymoons just makes it so much better! Especially if you used the motherlode cheat but only needed 5000 simoleons, its a great way to get rid of excess money!"
4,Good Addition,"The premise for Sims 2: Bon Voyage is fairly simple. Now your Sims can book a vacation and, for a up to a week, spend some time in a new vacation neighborhood. There are three new locations for your Sims to vist: Twikii Island, Three Lakes, and Takemizu Village. Your Sims can go on tours, interact with the locals, collect souvenirs, and take snapshots for their spiffy new photo albums, which can be ordered using a computer when they get back home. Sims don't have to worry about work or school when they go on vacation, and their aging is also suspended.If Sims have a good vacation, they get to choose from some new bonuses when they return. My favorite addition to the game is the beach lot; now your Sims can have houses on the beach and swim in the ocean. Overall I think this expansion pack is worth the money."
4,worth buying,This is a great expansions for Sims 2. Now Sims can go on vacation and do all sorts of new activities. You can send them on vacation to relax or as a honeymoon to 3 new areas or you can make your own vacation spot from scratch. You can also take other family members or friends with you. It's alot of fun!
1,SecuROM ALERT!!!,"Unbeknownst to you, this particular Sims 2 expansion pack will install SecurROM (a rootkit style copy protection created by Sony) to your pc and you won't be able to get rid of it. It's been known to screw up hardware configurations left and right. Nasty!"
1,Not Happy about Bon Voyage and SecuROM!,"I was looking forward to Bon Voyage, and HM Fashion Stuff. I have them sitting on my desk ready to install for the last 3 weeks! Thank my lucky stars I did not install either one. I was waiting for the patch. I was waiting to see what people thought of the patch. If I would of known that Maxis was putting SecuROM in the games, I would not of purchased either one of them. I will have no choice but to box both games up and send them back to Amazon for a full refund. As I can do that since they still have the seals on them. I will also cancel my pre-order (Teen Stuff pack) As I am aware that it will have SecuROM on it as well."
1,Installs unwanted program that can be harmful to computer,"The expansion was really bad, but the worst part is some kind of program called ""Securom"" that installs itself on your computer.The problem is that sometimes when I try to start the game, this unwanted program locks the whole computer and I can't do a single thing, I have to turn it off by the powerbutton which is NOT healthy for a computer.This happens 8/10 times when I try to play the game and it's not worth risking destroying my computer, so I'm uninstalling this game and never buying a Sims game again."
2,Didnt come,"I really wouldve liked to play. But I never got both CDs so I can't. It really is a bummer, for what I paid for it. I did get my $$ back though."
5,My reviews,I haven't recieved my product yet. So i made a mistake on buying a sims2 bon voyage from a diferent Bookseller. It was so scratched up that wouldn't play and it had no product code. Can't wait to get this one from Glen. Just to see how this one will play. I will come back and write a review when i get my item. But I have most all of the sims. Love them all. Very addicting.
5,The Best So Far!!,Have to say besides loving the season this is number 1 of all Expansion packs that they made so far for the Sims 2. I ony played on the island and can not stop plying for the Islands are great so far and love how you can pose for a picture and learn a fire dance which is fun to watch when they are learning it. Hope the other two places are just as fun. Hope everyone will enjoy this. for this is the best yet.
4,This game is just too cool,"I love this expansion pack it's too cool. I personally enjoy having bigfoot in my family, and the voodoo doll is way funny!"
4,Good Purchase,"I'm really happy with this buy. I have most of the Sims 2 Expansions, and this one is one of my favorites. There are a lot of fun things to do in each vacation spot, and so many things to explore. A great purchase!"
3,ok I guess,"This game is not as interesting to me as most of the add on gamesI thought Seasons was much more fun , Pets was more interestingThis one is just ok I would say only buy it on sale or used...."
2,Eh.,"I'll start off with the good things first. I love the ability to build beach lots and some of the new objects, interactions, and destinations are a ton of fun.Now for the things i don't like. First of all there aren't enough objects for the price, I can download twice as much, with better quality, for free. Second, it's extremely glitchy. Lastly, securom..."
1,Not that great,"First of all I totally agree with La Coccinelle's review. I have plenty of memory, graphic cards and anything else that this game needs to run and it is terrible, the graphics in my opinion are cheesy, it took forever to load and as my person on Twiiki Island was actually having fun it all crashed on me. I have unloaded the game and now my computer is happily running how it always does, great...honesty I feel these expansion packs are being put together too fast and not tested really well. The more that come out the more I am getting annoyed, there aren't that much things that adds to decorations, as I said the graphics are cheesy and it is not worth the time it takes to load the game for it to just crash... I can't take it back so it will just sit on a shelf collecting dust waiting to see if they come out with a patch or SOMETHING that will get it to work...I would not buy this until it has been out long enough for the glitches to be worked out..."
3,Definitely the weakest of all the expansions.,"I didn't like vacations much on Sims 1 and for Bon Voyage it's the same case. It doesn't have as much ""replay value"" in it as one would want for paying 30 bucks. The best things about it are the following:*A multitude of new ways to dance (such as hula and slap dance)*The beach locale is pretty cool to look at (the ocean looks really neat!)*The ability to purchase vacation homes at the 3 locations.However, overall, it's just isn't too exciting. The hotels are very expensive as well and someone who doesn't use cheats would be highly disappointed to have their sim spend that much money and get so little out of it. If you have limited money and can only get one or two expansions, do yourself a favor and pass Bon Voyage up. I highly recommend purchasing Seasons or Open for Business, the best expansions of the franchise!"
3,Its ALRIGHT,"Well, this game is honestly fun at first but then it just seems to get boring! I get so bored with the vacations that i end up leaving early! And this last time i tried to leave early the game wouldnt let me leave at all. I had to start completely over with a new family. It was quite frustrating. Also it kinda slowed the whole game down as soon as i installed it. I dont know if its just my computer or the game but still im going to say its really not worth it."
4,"Fun, but not what I expected","This was fun, but I expected it to be a lot more fun than it actually turned out to be! Be sure you have ""The Sims 2: Double Deluxe"" before buying this game! It won't work without it!"
3,Sims 2 Bon Voyage,"This is my least favorite Expansion pack for Sims 2. Unless you have a computer with a REALLY GOOD Graphics Card, this is not the Expansion pack for you."
4,It was pretty good,"If my computer could handle this more, I would love it. I'm reviewing this now from my standpoint when I first got it (through that special where you send in UPCs and get a game for free). I was in love with it, because it was so different. I love the beaches and the asian lands... and the mountains are wonderful too! I would visit these places, and I don't do well leaving my home."
3,Bad Situation Right Out of the Box,Received this game today for Christmas. I went to install it and it said that I needed to burn the ISO image. It's a good thing that I know what to do in this situation or I would be up crap creek without a paddle! I ended up having to zip up all the files and extract them elsewhere just to get the .exe file to install. It must have been a manufacturing error or something but I hope that after all this the game turns out to be really cool. I love the Sims 2 games and have all the expansion packs. This is the first time that this has happened when trying to install a game.
2,Heatsink will only fit a select few server mainboards,This heatsink will not fit any regular consumer mainboards and from what I could find was made for a few select Tyan mainboards that do not have any capacitors around the 775 socket. It will fit your mainboard only if any of the components around the socket are flush with the socket (1-3mm) like surface mount. I was only able to find Tyan 775 mainboards that were like this that this heatsink would fit on. So if your thinking about building a 1U rackmount with a regular mainboard then forget about wedging this heatsink in. It will rest on top of your capacitors and will not make contact or proper contact with the CPU. Thermaltake website lack any motherboard compatibility lists so BUYER BEWARE.
4,Great but not for the novice,"This is a comprehensive ""high end overview"" of the things you need to consider if you're going to design and build an underground house. It is not specific to a particular location or house design. As an engineer this book has provided me with a lot of insight into what I need to think about for my house. If you're looking for finished designs and building instructions this is not the book for you. It has been a great introduction for a house I'll be building in the Sierra foothills in the next few years."
1,Dogs didn't like them,"I will have to give this large tub of chews to the animal shelter since my 2 Bichons won't eat them.thank you,Mrs. Pamela Werling260-489-6086"
3,Good Product...Poor Customer Service,"The Tripp works; you plug it in and it works. However, it started to loose points on a couple of issues. First, it does not come with a ""recycle"" return label like APC has, so you have to flip for the shipping bill yourself. Not expensive, but a bit inconvenient. Second, the RBC7A did not fit nicely into my APC Smart UPS 1500. The width was just a bit wide. It almost seemed that it was slightly bulging on the sides. So the front stuck out just enough to where the front covers did not fit correctly. I had to force everything back together. Lastly, here is where it really lost points for me. I called Tripp customer service about the situation and they treated me with such indifference that they pretty much told me that that's your problem. I was quite stunned by the response and was wondering how they can call themselves ""customer service."""
5,Absolutely lovely!,"If you have ever had a charm bracelet, currently collect charms, or have ever wanted to start a collection - this book is for you! The ideas, history, and photos of the bracelets are all wonderful. It inspired me to clean up my old charm bracelets and, along with my current one, put them on display. They are works of art that tell a story. This book is also a great gift. It has inspired those I've given it to as it inspired me."
5,Charmed Inspirations,"Love this book! It inspired me all over to put together my charms with some of my mother's onto the bracelet she wore. Mine had hidden in my jewelry box for years and after finding this book, I put my charms and some of hers together, and its just beautiful. It's yellow gold, with special events, lockets, children's names, and events from my mother's and my life, along with three gold coins my grandmother had worn as pendants. The book is beautifully illustrated and written, and an absolute joy to look at and read~"
1,Don't waste your money,"I was under the impression that this book would show me how to make these charm bracelets. Yet it's anything but. It teases you with very beautiful pictures of charm braclets, yet that's about it. If you want a book of beautifully made charm bracelets, then this book is for you. If you want to learn how to make them, check out the classes at your local bead store."
5,"Fabulous, fun book -- perfect gift!","This book is a gem! The writing is wonderful, the photos beautiful, and the stories -- really vignettes -- are fabulous. The perfect size, it is also readable -- exactly what every woman wants to have on her bedside table.This book is sure to inspire women across the country to reach into their jewelery boxes and take out their own charm bracelets and wear them again and to start bracelets for their favorite girls to help them create their own ""personal histories on a wrist"" as Zabar describes these wonderful treasures.This book will my gift of choice for all my female friends for all their special occasions."
5,Charming!,"Beautiful little book with some terrific charm bracelets. As a charm collector, it was fun to read about the bracelets of their famous owners. I only wish that there had been photos of the bracelets worn by Jackie O and some of the other notable celebrities. My curiousity was piqued!Great tips for beginning charm collections, and overall, a fun read! This would make a great gift tied with a ribbon and garnished with a vintage charm from eBay!"
5,Charmed Bracelets,"Having recently inherited my Mother's charm bracelet, I have a new appreciation for the ""charmed"" beauty of it. Each charm meant something special to her and I want to continue that legacy by adding to it for my daughter. Loved the book and reading about the history of charms. The pictures are great too."
5,Transportative Earth Rhythms,"These tracks contain some hauntingly beautiful sounds that make me feel very earth-connected. The didjeridoo is amazing, and the percussion and voice make for incredible indiginous sounds, and I imagine tribal gatherings and previous times where we lived in community with the earth."
2,"Very dull, didn't expect a novel, but more interesting than","As I said I found this book very dull, I didn't expect a novel, but I have read other computer ""how tos"" that were very readable. I think a dictionary is more interesting than these Que Quick Reference books. Could use some illustrations etc. I was very dissapointed"
2,No.,"No.Read Beauclerk, Whittemore, Streitz,Anderson, Stritmatter, even Joe Sobran'soverestimated book on de Vere (my apologies,Mr Sobran. I do appreciate many of youressays. I hope you forgive me if you seeme in that dimension you believed in).This Shakespeare's Fingerprintes hassome good things that I did not haveseen before.But that is not a sufficient reason to givemy thumb down. I am sorry for their authors,for I know how hard it is to fight and after allthe sweat, to receive this kind of feedback.I have Aristotle's adage with me to justifymy decision: ""Amicus Plato, sed magis amica veritas."""
1,Many layered falsehood,"Approximately 75 thousand years ago (modern scholarship is not yet able to be more precise) Cave Man Jake, a Neanderthal, pounded and scraped a series of deathless dramas, a clutch of memorable poetry, into the chalks of the land we know as Southern England, and coated it with mastodon grease as a sealant. Wm. Shakespeare, an enterprising businessmen of the stage, hired the multitudinous young genius Chr. Marlowe to translate these works into English. By some shady strategm, public knowledge of this work of antiquarian scholarship was prevented from transpiring to the ears of the public and posterity. One wonders how the great scholar of Cave Man Language actually met his early demise.We know from all this, completely disregarded by the authors, that the Neanderthals were in truth every bit as intelligent as Cro-Magnon Man. Or at least Cave Man Jake was."
3,feels good but too big,"this masturbator does what its supposed too, lol. the only con i can find is that this thing is HUGE! Coudlve made it a little smaller to get the same effect, and clean up is kinda annoying as well."
4,It is kind of big,"Like the previous review mentions, it is a little to big. I am in the US Navy and this helps me thru many a long and lonely night. Sure the clean up can be a little messy but I just incorporate that into my fantasy of giving a rimmer to my partner when I'm through."
3,"good battle system, but slow.","I played many RPGs including old ones. I think the battle system is pretty good, but enemies actually play the game like the player which makes entire battle very slow when sometimes there are about 20 enemies. I had fun and like the game overall, but the waiting time is long and sometimes I had to level up characters even in easy mode.I still think it was the best RPG game I played in DS so far, I find the system similar to PC game final tactics series."
3,"A BASICALLY GOOD BOOK, BUT.....","....one that is marred by strident retro-male leftism (I don't know if it comes from Marsh or Bernard) I mean, I agree that Clinton's no better than Bush, but I find it funny that Marsh and Bernard refer to Al Gore as ""liberal"" (he himself openly admits he's not) in the contemptous way many leftists use the term, while many feminists might find THEM to be ""liberals"" in the same negative sense for defending the Rolling Stones as the ""first victims of political correctness"" Having said that, I still like the book. The best parts are when they display a sense of humor. Example: in response to a religious-right rock-hater's charge that a song by the Cars has Satanic ""backwards-masking,"" Marsh and Bernard reply: ""Well, now we know how he (Cars frontperson Ric Ocasek) got (80's supermodel) Paulina."""
4,On the Run,"As a senior in high school, I am looking for books that will interest me as both a school student as well as a young adult. I have found that book with Eve Cowen's Jungle Jenny.This story is about an American girl named Jenny going to Brazil to see if her boyfriend Cliff is cheating on her or not. While in Brazil she experiences a terrifying adventure as she tries to escape the Amazon.I enjoyed reading this book because it was an easy read and a page turner as well. It had my full attentiveness throughout the whole book. This book can appeal to a variety of age groups. I think teenagers would like this book for example; it has a great deal of suspense. I think that young adults would enjoy this book as well because it is a great page turner that leads to a great climax and ends satisfactorily."
4,My Kind of Music (in My Kind of Town),"I have such varied tastes in music, and depending on my mood, there are different things I want to listen to. This is one of the first CD's I've ever listened to that has something for any of those times. I also love the fact that I'm not just listening to 10 or 12 songs that are interchangeable. Thank you for giving us some talented variety! I may have to buy another copy; one for my car, and one for my wife's."
4,Welcome Back,"I don't purchase many cd's as a rule, however I enjoyed Welcome Back and Fact of the Matter so much that I purchased it as soon as I could. I also enjoyed My Light(deeper than now Reprise). this is excellent listening for all age groups."
5,Want Refreshing New Music - It's Right Here!!!!!,"I HIGHLY Recommend this CD. The music on this CD is very captivating after the first couple of times of listening. There are many parts to the CD, that after you listen to them a couple of times, really stick with you. I have discovered new sounds and new hidden hooks in the songs every time I hear it! The lyrics are pretty serious but the music really rocks! Can't wait for the concert!"
5,Tracks are...,1. The Boy Is Mine -- Branda2. Too Good To Be True -- Rhythm & Soul3. Ghetto Superstar -- Michael P.4. Let'S Rock -- DCM5. Bite The Bullet -- Shot Out6. Shame Shame Shame -- Rhythm & Soul7. Ccarnaval Carnaval -- Les Parisiens8. Pump It Up -- Dj Boom ( Featuring Mad X)9. I Like It -- Angel Moraaes10. Get Nervous -- Club Vinyl11.

Dancing In The Dark -- Garth
3,Good book,"I liked this book quite a bit. It covers the material well and the author does a fair, but adequate job of explaining the concepts. All in all it will serve you well.This book seems to skip around quite a bit, but there is always a lot of material to cover.One of the best books on Office Automation and getting things to work together is Learn Word 2000 VBA Document Automation (author: driza). Another book that some people liked (and some people didn't!) was by Steven Roman on Developing Office Add-ins. Roman's Word macro book is also fair."
1,terrible book,"I don't generally complaing about books so much, but this one I feel like burning. It was so skimpy in its coverage of each topic, that I found it pretty much useless. 30 pages about microsoft word - not very much, IMO. I would reommend Michael Kofler's ""Definitive Guide to Excel VBA"" (Apress) for Excel. Possibly Guy Hard-Davis ""Word 2000 Developer's Handbook"" (Sybex) for Word. And MS-online help for the other applications, i guess. Others have had better luck with this book it seems, so good luck in your own choice!"
3,"For the Developer, Not For Beginners...","""Developing Solutions With Office 2000 Components and VBA"" is a good book for someone who understands the big picture of the hows and whys of VBA. If you need to be led through a few complete examples or see why you would want to program a certain situation, this book is not for you. Aitken warns you of this in the introduction. For those of us a little slow on the uptake, better find another book with which to start. Come back to this book when you are ready to develop."
5,Great Follow up!,"The Follow up to Miss Daisy's first cook book. One of my favorites.Recommend to anyone who likes good food, and likes to entertain."
2,Broke After a Month,Mouse worked great and then stopped working after a month. It only cost 10.00 so no big deal but disappointing nonetheless.
1,spongbob NOT,This mouse only lasted a week then the ball got stuck.. definitely don't like it. It is supposed to made for kids but it needs to be more durable.
2,questionable,"4 some reason, my computer doesn't realise there's the mouse connected..i have to disconect and reconnect evrtine i start my computer..donno if it's my computer or the mouse"
5,"as long as you lather, works great",Though it smells like blueberry bubble gum this stuff works great.YOU HAVE TO BE SURE THAT YOU FULLY LATHER DOWN TO THE ROOTS OF YOUR HAIR.
5,can't wait for vol. II,"this is a tremendous blues disc. james puts on a powerful live performance, while equaly displaying the great guitar talents of hollywood fats and kid ramos. the music is jumping throughout the recording. james harman masterfully makes his harmonica sing. this is a great addition to any music collection, and a must have for any blues fan."
1,"smells bad, contains alot of alcohol and burns skin","I used to love this product, but they changed their formula recently. First I noticed that it smelled different, unpleasant, like industrial strength detergent mixed with elmer's glue. I applied to it to my skin and felt it burning. My skin was noticeably red in the mirror. It used to smell wonderful, like roses, and was soothing and made my skin look firm from the collagen. I called Aubrey about this and they told me the different scent was due to lavender oil they needed to add to denature the alcohol. Why so much alcohol? It causes burning sensation. And lavender never smelled bad like this. They couldn't explain that and recommended I simply return it."
1,wrong product sent,"I ordered Aubrey Collagen and Almond HAND AND BODY LOTION. I was sent Collagen and Almond ENRICHING MOISTUIZING LOTION. It has over 15 different ingredients from the one I ordered. Plus, it has a scent which I cannot use. I will not order from Tao of Herbs again."
3,great tape but...,"I thought this was an excellent tape as far as submissions go, I like the replays and the quality video editing--it makes the tapes watchable and exciting because I do not always want to watch guys in the guard for 5 minutes at a time(that is what Pride is for). I also like seeeing gi and no gi, makes for a good mix. The reason I gave it three stars was the sound track...it is very low rent, mostly ghetto raps with profanity being the used in every song, which means I cannot watch it with my kids or I have to mute it. IMHO, a soundtrack more akin to what you may find on CrossFit would better suit a BJJ video like this one."
2,Boring,"Save your money. This dvd is boring, poor quality film. Unless you competed at this event or know someone who did you'll probably want to skip this."
1,Don't waste your money!,"When you cut right down to it this book is just a 120 page commercial for the SINGMIN PCB. Andrew Singmin uses this book to continuously tell the reader that they'll have more success with electronics if they buy his PCB. The theory included in the book is non-existant, and the projects are simply a step by step guide of what to solder pin x of a 555 IC to. There is no discusion as to why. If you buy this book and build the projects, you will not have gained anything useful."
3,Not the basic analog electronics book I was looking for...,I was looking for a book that would have basic circuits that used transistors. The circuits in this book all use IC's - so not what I wanted.
1,Dissappointed!,"I purchased this and loved it for a year. The motor stopped working just over a year after I purchased it. Which was just after the warranty was up. I only used it for the holidays, so this was a huge disappointment. I purchased this one instead of the Kitchenaid, because several people complained of this problem with the Kitchenaid. This was a huge waste of money for me. Maybe a just got a dud!"
4,Here Come the Brides,"I first read Here Come the Brides in the late 1960's, so this was a re-read for me. It's a fun book, very fast paced and well written. The author is an English gentleman, writing in the first person as an American woman in her 20's living in mid-1960's NYC, working in the bridal department of a large NYC department store. The author makes a few mistakes as to how American women of that time period dressed and talked. For instance, most American women in the mid-1960's didn't wear hats and gloves to work, and on their days off they certainly didn't dress up in a suit and ""brogues"" to take a walk and visit a museum. Most young American women, both then and now, have never even heard of ""brogues"". They are heavy walking shoes, and no American girl would be caught dead wearing them with a suit. But this doesn't mar the writer's writing skllls and good sense of humor. The book is fun!"
3,"Good story, strange illustrations","Bought this as a Christmas book to read to our children on Christmas Eve- the written story itself is nice, but the illustrations are strange at best- very untraditional, somewhat frightening looking people/faces/angels."
4,A delightful album for electronic music lovers,"This long awaited album from the Alpha Conspiracy, formerly known as Necros, will take a prominent place into the collections of those who like the electronic music genre, as well, as those following the evolution of this artist since his first compositions in the demoscene...The mixture of sounds, rythms and ambiences builds up a miriad of extravagant and strong aural images thorough the well planned conjunction of elements, sometimes opposited ones. At the same time, soft and strange emotions arise from the hearing of this talented demonstration of refined habilities.In a few words: Addictive, creative and nicely strange."
4,Squeeze - Closes Out The 90's With A Pleasent Little Album,"I finally had the chance to see Squeeze live on this tour, so I picked up this album prior to the show. Chris Difford did not tour, but does appear on the album. I don't have any other Squeeze studio albums so there is not much I can compare this to. I find it to be a pleasant album that grew on me with continued listens. There are several really good tracks to be found here including ""Domino"", ""To Be A Dad"", ""In The Morning"" and the rather menacing ""Short Break"". The rest of the tracks are all at least decent as well. The album was released on the small Quixotic label and probably did not get the distribution that it deserved. ""Domino"" came and went from the shelves fairly quickly, so it may have been overlooked by fans of the band."
2,A disappointing end.,"What a disappointment. Domino sounds bland, boring and depressing. This from a band that brought such colour to the music scene from the late 70s right through to the superb Ridiculous in 1995. Apart from the odd exception like ""In the Morning"", this album sounds like a group that has lost the the ability to craft a great song.Play, Some Fantastic Place and Ridiculous were three of the best albums of the 90s by any group. Domino is very poor by comparison, and its lack of quality reflected the fact the group was falling apart by this stage."
3,Disappointing after two great albums,"After all the anticipation, ""Domino"" finally finds distribution in the U.S. - and what a disappointment! As a big fan of ""Some Fantastic Place"" and ""Ridiculous"" I felt let down by the bargain basement production and repetitiveness of the songs on ""Domino."" I found nothing as compelling as the highlights on their previous two albums; unless you're a die-hard fan, I recommend ""Play,"" their most consistently excellent album IMHO."
4,Very interesting,"Hans Hofmann's biography is very colorful. And his essay ""Search for the Real"" was a good read for any artist. Even if you don't really understand it or agree with his ideas, the descriptions of plasticity and push/pull are very enlightening. I'm sure he was an amazing teacher. This book is a good read for any artist, as well as for people who do not make art (to get a better understanding of the mind of the artist). This book was great! I recommend Kandinsky's ""Concerning the Spiritual in Art"" as a wonderful companion to this book. Between the two your mind can encompass art and thinking that is related to art in new (maybe even familiar) ways."
5,great book for philosophical art discourse,The philosophy of art is fascinating. this book is a key text for any student wishing to broaden their horizons in this field.
2,could pass,"I had to read this book for a class. Unless you're a die hard Hans Hoffman fan it's definitely not a must read. The book really shoots all over and is difficult to read I found. There are much better art theory books out there along with books that will tell you a lot more about hans hoffman. If you're looking for an art theory book "" The Art Question "" or "" Art and Fear"" are much better books."
3,Thorough investigations on the Proto-Indo-European,"Many distinguished linguistic archeologists made the thorough investigations on the history of Proto-Indo-European(PIE) language. However, I had a slight disappointment on this book, because I had expected a wide range of reconstructed PIE words in this book. This book does not have such a word list. However, it has very precious archeological data for the PIE language. This book also has some commemorial pictures of Marija Gimbutas."
3,Very wide but a lot of compromise,"I'm not too happy about this product but looking at the price, maybe that's what you pay for. The wide angle is good but the vignetting is terrible. The picture becomes almost unusable unless I forgo using the adapter and just hold the lens right in front of camera.I must say however that the macro lens is superb! I can take really close macros now."
2,Not much music for a CD,"This CD only has a play time of 22:55. Nowhere on the case, in the liner notes, nor on the disc itself is there an indication of how short the music selections are. There are 9 songs on the disc, so by doing the math, average song time is 2 1/2 minutes. Come on, this is ridiculous!"
4,Authentic sound,This is one of the only CDs on the market that doesn't have that annoying background techno beat. Just pure steelpan. It sounds great!
3,Could be better,"Although this CD has an interesting lineup of songs, I found the versions of the songs bland and uninspiring. The recording is thin sounding and lacks the rich full sound that makes the steel drums a wonderful instrument."
4,Good Buy,"Overall this Money Clip is a huge space saver, sometimes I forget I have it with me. You can fit 2 cards per slot but it'll be a tight fit.. I also fin some other small cards/papers that I have to carry with me in the ID center slot. I havent had a bill fall out yet but their edges will stick out over the sides especially you have more than one bill, the picture is really depicting that. I currently have 5 cards in the front and still got room for 1, maybe 2 more. Good buy overall"
2,Returned it,"In short, here's why I returned it.1.Embossing uneven.2.Inner pocket blocked by ""made in China"" label and bent my business cards.4.Front three card holders are too shallow and expose cards.5.Bill holder is attached on the wrong side, magnet is weak, & it only holds two twenties.6.It's just too big. Like holding a deck of cards in your pocket.Look to Bey-Berk for a solid, simple, well made product."
3,"If you carry a lot of bills, don't buy it","While this is a well made item, the money clip is magnetic, so it is only useful if you just carry a few bills with you. If you carry more than 10 bills, buy an all metal pressure clip, not a magnetic one."
5,Other names for this book,"""Captain Horatio Hormblower"" was first published as ""The Happy Return"" in 1937. It was then renamed ""Beat to Quarters."" These books, unfortunately, stop on the return to England. But ""Beat to Quarters"" is available on Amazon.com. There are more reviews there."
5,Captain hornblower,I first thought the price was too good to be true! The price for the paper back was over $40. The Condition of the Book was remarkable and that made the price absolutely unbelievable! It was worth the price I paid and I think the company that sold it to me should have charged more but it is too late for that and I am VERY happy with the book!
5,Jaw dropping,"The only place I had ever heard Al Green before receiving this LP, was Pulp Fiction. I liked it a lot and had heard other good things. But this is no ordinary record. This is my favorite record ever. Green's voice is smooth and superb. A very relaxing album."
5,Al Green,"So good! Vintage Al Green. Not many songs in the album, but really good stuff. I didn't know I was a fan until I got this for my Kindle, and I listen to it a lot."
5,A classic Al Green album,"Everyone knows the title track ""Let's stay together"", but the other ten songs on this album are equally good; personal favourites are ""So you're leaving"" and ""It ain't no fun to me"". Of course you should buy this album for Al Green's incomparable vocals, but don't overlook Willie Mitchell's arrangements, both sparse and rich/lush where appropriate. This band has one of the coolest rhythm sections, including legendary Memphis drummer Al Jackson Jr. on the title track. If you are new to Al Green, I'd recommend starting with the albums ""I'm still in love with you"" and ""Call me"", then ""Let's stay together""; but they are all five star albums, and it hardly makes sense to rank them."
2,Remastered ....Not,"Denmon Records from 1986 is the equal, at least, of this sorry edition. Why buy a remaster if you can't tell even a slight increase in quality compared to a version that was released 19 years ago. Even the liner notes are better in the older version."
2,GREAT ALBUM BAD REMASTERING JOB,"This is one of Al greens best albums he ever did.I used to have the original CD but I decided to get the new remastered version,and boy was I shocked the sound qualitiy is not good at all the highs are very muffled and the songs that fade out are faded out faster. So don,t get this version get the original it only has 2 less songs but the sound is A lot better and it is cheaper."
5,AWESOME!!! Just straight up AWESOME!!!!,"This is simply Al Green! Forget anything and everything you have heard other than this is Al Green, early in his career, moanin', groanin', and just plain old fantastic soul singing. If you really are a soul singer subject matter expert, and I rank myself as the best, you will play ""young Al"" over and over. I first fell in love with this cd when it was an album. I was a young soldier, living off post, in an apartment furnished with a component set, a water bed, and my Al Green albums. Needless to say, I was well entertained, and trust me, I entertained well! Al Green will still work for you. Buy the cd and play it to death!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,CFP Certified Financial Planner Examination,"Do not order this book if you are interested in studying for the CFP exam, it will only be waste of your time and money. The book has roughly 200 hundred pages of questions which don't even resemble CFP questions for which no reasoning is given for the answers, only the correct letter. The so-called preparation section looks like it was taken directly from several different books, the fonts and page styles change from section to section, and one section addresses investing as if the reader is a first time invester in mutual funds and another section reads likes you are a small business owner. The books learning section does not even mention, let alone address estate planning, it seems as if the writer does not even know what is on the exam. ..."
4,Excellent northern european jazz!,"The dynamics presented by this trio is of the kind that keeps one interested title after title. This group sounds like other ECM artists in the same style / format (Jarrett, etc.) but with a distinctive northen 'twist'. We've heard the drummer Jon Christensen in other Jarrett and Rypdal formations, and Andre Jormin in other 'popular' ECM groups of recent times. Both are great at supporting Stenson in his exploratory searches at the keyboard. A sense of mysterious, calm -yet- always in turmoil music pervades through out the cd. Highly recommended!"
5,incredible,"this is what an American Idol show is all about. top tier talent in there prime and peak getting down on the stage where business is suppose to be handled. depending on where you go back in time old school knows that the best of the best did there thang on stage. so many great acts on this bill, however James Brown and the Famous Flames owned this stage and for me that performance by the Godfather and the Flames is what I'd call top 5 all time tv music performance by any act in any time period. everybody on here represents though and the music and songs speak for themselves.a must own collection. for the music historian and collector. enjoy."
5,Best Concert Ever?,"I saw the TAMI movie at the age of 10 in Eureka, Ca but could never remember the name of it when discussing great concert movies with friends. Of course 'Woodstock' will always be held in the highest regard (and rightfully so), but the TAMI movie was just as historic. Hard to believe a SoCal radio station gave tickets away! The lineup is a 'who's who' of American & British Rock and R&B. Marvin Gaye and James Brown? It doesn't get any better than that. Buy this DVD and see numerous future Rock & Roll Hall of Famers perform in their prime!"
5,Fabulous DVD,Wow - what a great dvd. We could not believe they got all of this on film. It is truly one fabulous talent after another. Great entertainment which was enjoyed across the generations.Our favorite performance was James Brown - what incredbile energy.
4,Trip Down Memory Lane,"Wow, what a cast--something for everyone. What a diverse group. Too bad its in B&W and not in color. Brought me back to a time when life was so much simpler--and so was the music--simple but sublime."
5,Musical Hisory,"When word got out in Santa Monica that the TAMI show would be in town, my friends asked me to go with them. I was not interested so I didn't go. I sure regret it now. I could have been part of gr8 recorded musical history."
5,46 year wait is over,"i remember my friends and i going to the old lorenzo theatre (san lorenzo,cal) to see this several times. this movie has stuck in my head since 1964 , but FINALLY available on dvd. my wife and i have watched this dvd four times already and we LOVE IT ! ! ! i enjoy watching this more than any concert i've ever attended , and i've been to some great ones ! the go go girls get a little annoying , but hey , it was 1964 and thats the way it was . i seriously like the whole thing , but the james brown /rolling stones ending is ASTOUNDING ! ! ! theres something for everyone on this and well worth the price ! ! !"
5,Ahead of it's Time,"The whole film is worth purchasing just for Lesley Gore's performance of ""You Don't Own Me"". Absolutely epic and waaaaaay ahead of its time!"
5,"roll out the 60's, again.","The T.A.M.I. show video is very well ""remastered"", with excellent video and audio. You will find yourself ""locked in"" on this concert, enjoying the excellent music, when most of these groups were in their peak. of the hundreds of music video concerts I have, this is a top ten!!"
5,Must see,"This is worth it just for the James Brown performance alone, but there's plenty of other good stuff as well."
4,Forty-six years later,"I saw the T.A.M.I. Show in a theater when it was originally released. Most of the performances faded from memory, perhaps unfairly, but I had never forgotten the James Brown set. That's why I bought this disc. Even after the earliest influences of the English Invasion, this was a revelation to small-town white boy. The energy, the unfamiliar music, the showmanship, all burned themselves into my memory. Better still, 46 years later, JB is not disappointing.It's also fun to compare the flash-in-the-pan groups who happened to be famous for their 15 minutes at this time with those genuine stars: the Miracles, the Supremes, Chuck Berry (who deserved more footage), Marvin Gaye, and the Rolling Stones. Even Lesley Gore, who proves here to be a much more capable singer than I had remembered.We also learn how primitive the sound systems were then, by current standards. The video is surprisingly good.Chris Campbell"
5,GREAT DVD,So fortunate to have been able to get the T.A.M.I. Show after all these years. Great music and memories.
3,"Historically, Very Interesting But...","...most of the music just isn't all that great. Compare the later works of James Brown and Marvin Gaye to this stuff and it just doesn't fly. It is good to see footage of the Stones with their founder, Brian Jones as well as The Miracles with Smokey Robinson."
3,Where is Blu-ray edition?,"If this was mastered from a high definition transfer, then where is the HD Blu-ray version of the program??"
1,Missing Acts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have the original Version on VHS. Where are the Ronettes? Where is Ike and Tina Turner? This is not the Full Version!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I am upset that they would even try to pass this off as the original. DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111
1,THE T.A.M.I. SHOW COLLECTORS EDITION,DO NOT BUY! IT DOES NOT CHANGE TRACKS. TO MUCH HASSEL TO SEND BACK. KENT
4,Why is this classic concert cropped in fake widescreen?,"Excellent picture quality, the best sound quality available (not completely drowned out by screams as in past versions), mostly outstanding performances by numerous future Rock & Roll Hall of Famers.But why, oh why, did the producers of this DVD feel the need to crop the picture into a fake 16:9 ""widescreen"" image? Did they think the viewers were too stupid to adjust the viewing ratio on their widescreen sets to the proper 4:3 ratio? If you watch carefully, most of the group shots cut off the performers at the shins/knees, and many closeups are awkwardly framed (Lesley Gore). If you don't believe me, check the DVD that comes with the special edition of the Beach Boys ""Sounds of Summer""; it contains the TAMI show footage in it's original 4:3/1.33:1 ratio. You can see their shoes!If this hadn't been cropped my rating would have been 5 stars; it's still an indispensable musical video document of the sixities."
4,Rock N Roll down Memory Lane,"What a wonderful collection of musical moments frozen in time to be enjoyed forever. It was magical,even mystical to see these acts in their glorious 60's style. Bravo!"
5,FIND IT!!,"Joining other NPR listeners captivated by David Simon's enthusiastic pitch for this lost gem...Godfather of Soul giving way to Stones when they were just earnest young bad boys...sounds indispensable !! Since it apparently finally made it to DVD, how could it have disappeared again??"
2,Disappointed,"If this was a totally live performance by ALL the artist, then I'm ready to be corrected. Although the mic's appear to be hot, not all of the instrumenta are actually being played. Of all the performers the only ones who even look like they are delivering the goods is Chuck Berry and the Stones."
5,A man for the ages,"As one who grew up listening to Mr. Robeson's powerful voice and learning his poignant history, this compilation is priceless. A genius who was not fully recognized in his own time, Mr. Robeson sings to us of ageless mysteries."
2,losers strike again,"not very long, no character development, just violence without motivation, ordinarily I like the last but it wasnt very good violence"
5,Truly Enjoyable and A Great Tribute,"This is a wonderful documentary that not only tells a beautiful story about artist Aljeandro Santiago, but gives perspective on what happens to a town when a majority of its villagers have left. If you are of Mexican heritage or interested in Mexican culture, art, immigration and/or documentaries, this is highly recommended!"
4,"So Human, So Beautiful",What a challenging and emotional project this must have been. I feel very lucky to have seen this at all. Viva Mexico!!
5,My favorite contemporary artist film,This is absolutely is by far the best film about clay migrant statues ever made!!!
1,disappointing documentary,"This was a very disappointing movie, not the artist, but the filmwork. Long monologs with pretty much same stories from the workers and repetitive journeys to the village with same story on how the people moved out didn't help showing the great idea of the project. I bought it to show to my high school students who are mostly Mexican and was hoping to give them a great piece of art and inspiring story, but I am afraid keeping them focused for 57 min will be hard, I had hard time staying focused, and I am usually excited about everything. Also reading captions takes away from looking at the images, and my students are slow readers. I wish there would be more artwork and less people talking; the workers are not good story-tellers! The painting on the cover was so promising, and I don't even remember if it was in the movie."
4,Good ball; way over-priced,"This is a good ball for mid-to-high handicappers, but the $40 asking price is much too high. They're readily available in golf shops & sporting goods stores for around $20/dozen."
2,A Concept That Falls Flat,"I was so excited for this play to come in. I expected a complex mix of the oppression of Catholic school life and the beautiful poetry of Shakespeare's most famous lovers. Instead we get what is basically the script of Romeo and Juliet with lackluster stage directions and zero characterization. There are glimmers of characters, but we never get more than what we would get in some sort of table read. That's what R&J is, essentially: a table read. I wanted so badly for the characters to blossom and for this play to take over their lives, but instead they read it and are done with it. And so am I. Do yourself a favor and just read Romeo and Juliet."
5,Great Book Used for Homeschool,"Really happy with this book, especially the various exercises with the weekly words. It's not just about spelling, but also where the word comes from (there are breakdowns of root words, prefixes, and suffixes), what the word means, and different ways to use it. With an advanced reader some of the words aren't too difficult, but the activities are challenging and teach him more about the words other than just how to spell them. Would highly recommend this book to both secular and Christian based learners."
3,SERIOUS 70'S CHEESE/FUSION!!,"MIKE AND RANDY BRECKER......GENIUSES,HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL,JAZZ GREATS,HARMONIC PATHFINDERS,HIGHLY SKILLED TECHNICIANS.....ETC ETC ETC......RANDY'S SINGING???I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM WHEN I WAS 15 YRS OLD,WORE IT OUT...TABULA RASA....BEST MIKE SOLO EVER!!!!! RANDY'S SINGING HAS ALWAYS BEEN A BIT OF AN ODD CHOICE!!BUT....PLEASE GET THIS ALBUM.....THE MUSICIANSHIP/HISTORICAL IMPORTANCE/VIBE IS WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!EVEN IF YOU DON'T DIG ""FINGER LICKIN GOOD""ALSO GREAT ""BROTHER"" PIC ON THE COVER!!"
1,"May work, but is really dangerous....","I read several reviews of this product that say it works wonders and although I only took one dose, I believe that it may in fact work. However, the ingredient list contains 60mg of Tea Tree Oil. Everything I have read about Tea Tree suggests that it should NEVER be ingested. I did a little research and found nothing to contradict that information. Just to be sure, I contacted a trusted herbalist to get a second opinion. She consulted several of colleagues and they all said the same thing...NEVER ingest Tea Tree Oil. So, although this product may cure your Candida, but it contains an ingredient that if ingested can also be toxic or cause internal bleeding or cause you to lapse into a coma, etc., etc., etc. So, I couldn't possibly recommend this to anyone.By the way, I contacted Solaray to ask why they included something like Tea Tree in a supplement. No one ever got back to me."
5,Best Anti-Yeast product I've found - love it.,"I have tried a number of Anti-Yeast supplements, but I found this one helps me the most. Tho at first I wasn't sure I liked the (tea-tree oil) smell, now I like it ! and it absolutely helped decrease my sugar cravings. Would highly recommend this product, I keep reordering it."
3,Odd smell similar to paint thinner,The contents of the bottle and pills smell very similar to paint thinner. The product seems to work ok but I wont be ordering more because of the odd smell.
3,What is the actual ct on that?,"I am looking at the description of the item and at the picture. The description says ""180 capsules"". The product label in the picture shows ""90 capsules"". The Solaray web-site shows only one packaging option for ""Yeast-cleanse"" and it is 90 capsules.Isn't that confusing? If it is indeed 90, I could buy it cheaper at a local Vitamin Shoppe."
3,"Good product, but not strong enough","This is a Yeast CLEANSE, not a yeast supplement. It works well but since they tend to make one drowsy, taking them at bedtime is the only time that makes sense, and with a recommended dosage of 6 caps, it's a mouthfull. Why don't they make a more concentrated version?"
4,Only 4 stars because of the sound quality.,"It's always great to hear Kraftwerk's albums in German and many times, it's even better than the English versions. There are subtle differences in some songs such as Taschenrechner (Pocket Calculator). On the German version, you can actual hear the song end as it fades out. The English version fades before that point. On Numbers there is a slight difference immediately when the second voice starts counting in German and on It's More Fun To Compute"", there is an extra sound a few seconds after the first chorus. The problem with the disc, or at least the one I have, is the sound quality. It sounds a little duller than the English version and the sound level is definately lower. I played them one after the other to compare and I had to raise the volume on the German version. Still, I always like to have both the German and English versions of Kraftwerk's CDs whenever possible and this is a great addition to my collection."
4,Wunderbar,"I have never owned this album and the only exposure I have had to any of the songs has been those that were on The Mix. Now hearing the original, in German and remastered I am in raptures over this 1981 offering from Das Boys."
1,Check with vender before ordering,Several people have been receiving a 7300LE card instead of the advertised 7600GT. The 7600GT is a good card but the 7300LE does not compare to it for gaming. Check with the vendor and have them verify if they even list this model in there inventory before ordering. Amazon listed PCUniverse and RitzCamera as the seller but they only carried the 7300LE for the price listed.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM ritzcamera,"Like the others have said, it is the wrong card. Ritz will not take responsibility for the mistake, but were kind enough to give me the option to buy the 7900GT at $240 while I go through the RMA process for the 7300LE. If it is to good to be true, then it is probably not true!"
1,I received NX7300LE also,"The same thing happened to me, I ordered 2 of what I thought were 7600GT & received 2 7300LE. I'm still waiting for the RMA to return them & no word yet if I will have to pay the s&H back to PC universe just to get a refund on my CC. All I received back was that it was a mapping error, well this was several days ago & they still have it listed as a 7600GT, it may be the ole bait & switch routine........"
1,Don't have it yet,"Due to a snafu between the vendor and Amazon, I have yet to receive my product. As soon as I get it, I'll revise my review."
4,"Excellent price, but chip within is Realtek","This is probably the only Gigabit card for PCMCIA you'll ever find without breaking your wallet. It works well, the only downside is the Realtek chipset. Performance will never be on-par with the better chips, but for the cost, who cares."
5,Incredible ... She can really rock,"This artist is absolutely incredible, being a Detroiter, I am able to see her live and I must say that she can really put on a great show. She has the voice and the image to really succeed. I just hope more people listen, and she really takes off."
4,helping,"It has not been long enough since my husband and I started to take the Optimized Carnitine but it seems to help,especially, him. We have to wait a little longer to truly see a difference. The price was better than if I bought it from the Life Extention even at the members' price."
5,Does more than I could have hoped.,Seems to increase blood flow near the brain. My upper sinus clears with just two pills thus my MIGRAINE headache goes away. My mood is better.
3,Interesting story but...,"I was intrigued by an excerpt of this book, assigned as part of a short stories unit in my son's English class. Unfortunately, the most interesting part of the whole book was that excerpt. While the author presents a very interesting story of a young immigrant girl growing up in Boston during the 50s, not unlike my own story (although mine would be 10 years later), the quality of the writing isn't up to par. Many chapters went off tangent and the prose was dull. I was disappointed because the book could have been fascinating had it been shorter or written better. Perhaps avid middle school readers may still find it a good read for its subject matter, but only if they aren't picky about writing quality."
2,Don't waste your money!,"I thought this would be the perfect toy for my 18 month old who loves Elmo. He has a couple of Elmo dolls but the fur on this one is poor quality and sheds on everything. It also says ""Hop like a Cat"" and ""Skip like a Pig"" a couple of other phrases that don't make sense. The Elmo I received didn't look like the one in the picture. He has a shirt that says Elmo on it and a little dog. My son loves Hokey Pokey Elmo and could care less that this Elmo knows his name."
1,DONT BE FOOLED,"www.personalizedbyrus.com is the WORST company on amazon.com. I ordered this gift for my niece's 1st birthday. The company failed to mention that it was not in stock. Then when I called to inquire about the status of the gift, I was told it would be sent the next week - A COMPLETE LIE. 2 weeks later I sent an email since their phone lines were constantly busy- NO REPLY. NOW 2 months after I initially ordered it and I cannot get intouch with anyone at the company to get my money back. THIS COMPANY IS A CROOK."
1,very dissapointing,I too was very dissapointed in Elmo's appearance. The picture makes him look so cute with his sweatshirt and jeans and shoes. Instead he comes with a blue and yellow shirt that is too small and has a hard dog sewed to his arm.TACKYUGLY
1,Not all names available,"I was under the impression that any name can be put into a computer and Elmo will be able to say it, but I went yesterday to get the toy for my niece Naja and was told that Elmo can't say her name!"
4,Elmo is smarter than he may appear,"I bought this at the TRU store in Times Square, where they'll personalize Elmo for you while you wait. Just a heads up to those who can't find their child's name listed here that the store got our Elmo to say a name that's not in the Amazon lookup under any of the spellings i tried. I think they entered the name phonetically or something like that. I'm not sure how you'd do this through Amazon, but Elmo is indeed smarter than you might think!As for the quality of the toy, i can't really say, because it's a gift. Looks good though!"
1,Great toy... one problem,"Wanted this really bad for my daughter- Tierney. Yes, her name is not common. I would understand if elmo didn't say it, except the Dora doll will say it. Why wouldn't Elmo be able to if Dora can???? I know my daughter would love this."
5,Good Gift,"My father bought this Elmo for my son,Malcolm's first birthday and it was a hit. My son is always hugging it but I'm not sure if he is aware that Elmo is saying his name. Elmo was not dressed as he is in the picture he only had on a Elmo t-shirt."
5,"Our Daughter hasn't seen it yet, but we're loving it now!!","It's a few weeks before Christmas and I ordered this a couple weeks ago. I arrived in less than a week, so I was impressed by that. It does EXACTLY want it was billed to do! Our daughter's name is Tatiana, so I had my doubts about this product, but I was pleasantly sursprised that ELMO got every last syllable right on the money. It's a Christmas gift for our 1 1/2 year old who just adores Elmo. We've played it for all our friends and they and Grandma can't get enough of it. It's a very inexpensive buy, but it'll be priceless to your child."
5,What a Great Doll!,"I just received Elmo and it is absolutely adorable! It is so soft and cuddly and says plenty of phrases (with and without the name). It is a gift for my niece's first birthday and I cannot wait to give it to her. My only regret is not ordering one for my own 10 month old, and just about every other child I know..."
3,Wish I had waited,"I am disappointed that I jumped into buying this particular Elmo. He says my daughter's name just fine but is very limited to what else he says. I saw the other ""He knows your name"" doll at Toys R' Us and was bummed because there were more interesting things that you could download off of a disc for Elmo to say. Oh well, live and learn."
5,A favorite in our house,"I bought this talking/personalized Elmo for my daughter, a big Sesame Street fan, when she was 15 months old. At 2, she still gets a huge kick out of hearing him say her name. She also really likes the part where Elmo makes you guess the animal sounds. It makes her laugh every time! We have since given this toy as a gift to several children we know and they are enjoying it too."
3,Elmo doesn't work,"I purchased this ELMO for my 16 month old son as a Christmas gift. My son loved him, but didn't play with him too much initially. 3 months later, my son is extremely interested in ELMO, constantly squeezing his hand and hugging him. We have not been rough on this ELMO, however, We have become very disappointed, because he does not work! We've tried new battereies, adjusting the position of the sound box, etc., but it appears that there is some kind of short in the wiring. I contacted Personalized R US, and unfortunately, they will do nothing when it has been longer that 30 days since purchase. This toy is cute, and a great idea, but for the price, I expected it to last more than 3 months. I recommend not buying it."
3,Name not Available,"I was very disappointed that out of all the names available to use my child's name (Payton)was not an option. The main reason for buying this item was to hear her name, without that the toy is really of no use or value."
4,Elmo has an accent but great toy!,"My son LOVES that Elmo ""knows his name"" and at the age of 19 months he plays with him everyday. When we first got him Elmo would say ""Oink like a bird"" or ""Quack like a Lion"" but then about 4 months ago he all of a sudden would say the correct phrases i.e. ""oink like a pig"", quack like a duck"" etc. Obviously they have some quality control issues but it is what it is and now it works and my son loves him!"
1,I can't believe it!!!,"My daughters name is Rose and that name is not available! I am very upset, this toy looks great but come on! The name Rose is as simple as you can get!!!!"
4,Not as good as Elmo Knows Your Name,"This is a personalized item that is not the same as the Toy-r-Us ""Elmo Knows Your Name"" doll. I purchased this doll and about one day later my wife found the ""Elmo Knows Your Name"" doll in stores. I learned that the other doll does so much more then this one so I decided to return it. It is possible to return this item, but you lose the cost of shipping both ways. I never opened this up so I can't say how good or bad it is. I know that one from Toys-r-Us knows more then just one name. You can also program it with the times for things such as Breakfast, Naps, Lunch, and Dinner. The only con here is that you have to program these things exactly on the hour (Ex: lunch has to be 11am vs 11:30am which isn't an option). Also, you can put in your childs favorite color, other family member's names, and you can pick from a wide variety of songs for Elmo to sing. Before you order this doll please check for the other Toys-r-Us version of it."
1,Very Disappointed!! Not what I ordered.....,I purchased this for my son for his 2 year birthday present. I ordered an Elmo wearing a cute sweatsuit and instead I got an Elmo with a tee shirt holding a dog. I am really not happy and feel that I have been a victom of false advertising. I am very disappointed in TRU. This is not like them and they may have lost a very good customer over this!!!
5,adorable,this elmo is extreemly cute.kids of all age love to hear their name being called out by elmo!!!highly recommended.
5,Love it!,"I actually got this doll while I was pregnant at my baby shower as a gift. I was surprised when it had my babies name on it. I personally loved it. And now that that my daughter is 8 months old, she lights up and smiles every time Elmo says her name."
1,Image Entertainment presents another substandard release,"I was so looking forward to watching this DVD. After finding this unknown film noir, I noticed it was issued by Image. Anyone familiar with their products knows by now that purchasing from Image is hit and miss in terms of quality. This one is clearly not remastered - or even restored in any way. In fact, the print is plagued in numerous spots from where the film print had broken and then was spliced together with a few damaged frames at each splice being removed. When oh when will Image have a consistant quality of product? This could have been a delighful purchase has been turned into a lesson not to buy any more DVDs from this company!"
3,Just your average Gangster movie,"To me it was just your average gangster/film Noir with Lawrence Tierney as a man who gets out of jail on parole (thanks to his mom) and despite the help of his family to go straight, he cant help but be uncouth & gets involved with a gang to commit a large sized crime. Nothing but heartache and death follow. Tierney plays a really good jerk :)It reminded me of Invisible Stripes, but it is not as good. Another film that sounded good,but was just run of the mill when I saw it. You really have to be a die hard Gangster movie (meaning you would like a lesser Warner Brothers Gangster movie like Dillinger) to really get into it. Not awful, but not a real classic either.."
4,trimmer string,I am satisfied with product although it was not quite what I expected. Description was not clear.
3,Enjoyable but ...,This was my first introduction to the poetry of Remco Campert - an interesting but frequently unsatisfying experience. A handful of the poems were gems but the majority left me feeling as though the poetry suffered in translation - not a reflection on the translator so much as a sense that the poetry itself was extremely difficult to translate and retain Campert's aesthetic sense. Some wonderful turns of phrases and thought-provoking images - enough to make me wish I could read it in the original.
2,Thought-provoking at times...but verbose and general,"While the author makes some interesting points at times, overall the book is a slog to get through - the book seems to be written as the equivalent of a Master's thesis. Using too many fancy words and complex sentences (and not enough facts and figures) seriously waters down the arguments. In fact, I am not sure the author will convince someone not already pre-disposed to agree with her.All of this might be forgiven if the author offered more implemenation and tactical ideas. This is not a how-to book on the implementation of new philanthropic ideas. It is more of an opinion piece on why NPB is more effective.While it makes some valuable points on this front, overall the book suffers from its intended weight, and it is difficult to recommend as an investment of time."
5,haunting,"This is a richly written book. Gordimer handles the character in an interesting way--one of the reviewers said that she couldn't relate to the character, and I think that is because Gordimer is presenting her as someone who is puzzling to other people, a ""sport"" or new species. You don't get into the heroine's head so much as you try to figure out her mysteries. Of course, that means Gordimer is giving the reader the role of someone from the ordinary world who isn't quite as evolved sexually or politically as her heroine. I found the heroine haunting because of her self possession, her practically unselfconscious drive to grow that freed her of much of the guilt and fear of isolation that keep most of us from doing the right things."
4,Look beyond normal reading,"I do not agree with the substandard reviews of this book. If you are interested in South Africa don't be afraid of a more difficult read and pick up this book. It is a little difficult to get into but once you get used to Gordimer's writing style, anyone will enjoy it. Hillela is a very interesting character who one can not underestimate. I like her spirit, and I truely think she has a complete change of character by the end of the story."
1,big disapointment,"This was a book that i was required to read for my english lit class. Although i didn't personally like the book, many people that i know did. I found the subject matter very boring, partly because of my inability to relate to it. I would only recommend this book to someone with a strong interest in South African politics."
2,Yawn,"This is said to be one of Nadine Gordimer's finest works, and she is a Nobel prize winner, so I hoped for great things when I picked this one out at the bookstore, unfortunately assuming that the Nobel prize would be a guarantee that I would love it. Well, I didn't love it. While indeed a competent storytelling, I don't really regard this as literature. There is not the fire, imagination or creativity one expects, nor the sophistication that should elevate such a work above its peers. I managed to get to the end, but I can't say that I felt or learned anything at all. It makes me wonder if there were political, rather than literary reasons that caused the Nobel comittee to honor this author."
4,Only two problems,"This product is pretty good. It's a comfortable material, the socks go up to a good height, and they look professional. There are just two problems. First, if you get caught in the rain with these socks on, then your feet will turn blue with the dye. Second, they fall down to around your ankle after a few hours of wearing them, like almost all other socks do. Other than that, these socks are great."
2,HUH!,"I am an fan of historical fiction From the Hornblower saga to Kent to Dudly Pope to name a few. I think Molloy's ""Peter Raven UNDER FIRE"" was in bad need of an editor who knows the period of the Bonaparte and English war during the 1790's to 1805. The writter needs to know what makes a COMMODORORE in the British Navy of the period. The line of battle ship in the book was 110 guns. OOPS! The ""HMS Torren"" went to sea to the Caribbean with half a crew. OOPS! It would never have left England with 500 men. Three pirate schooners captured the first Rate Battle ship of the line ""HMS Torren""--OOPS! DAH! The story line was ok and the cast of Characters got better after they are defined as the story progresses. I hope the follow on Peter Raven, Midshipman, gets better."
3,"Has promise, yet still disapointing.","I was actually very disapointed in this novel. I love historical fiction, especially plots surrounding the 1800's and seafaring in the British navy. However I was not duly impressed.The characters were very bland, and very hollow. Without strong, charismatic characters the story remains an skeleton of an novel; something like reading a thick, dull history book in school.I have to give Mr. Molloy one thing, he was very well researched and his plot was excellently devised; but I honestly did not enjoy it."
5,Excellent resource for creative problem solving only,"From a creative thinking/problem solving standpoint, this is a excellent resource. From a opportunity finding viewpoint, it's quite disappointing, personally speaking. Although the coverage on the aspect of creative thinking is very broad and somewhat deep in many respects, with good, useful strategies/techniques and examples to follow, it does not offer much in terms of opportunity finding approaches for the business reader. For that, you need to buy and read Michel Robert's ""Innovation Formula"", and/or Edward de Bono's ""Opportunities"", and/or & Nigel MacLennan ""Opportunity Finding."" Neverthesless, this book is still worthwhile to be bought/read and kept in your personal library. Reading it is like reading many creative thinking books in one go. The author drew a lot - I mean really a lot - of creativity stuff from other books."
5,amazing,this was a book sitting on my bookshelf in 7th grade that got donated to my school and nobody else had been intrested in reading it. I read and did a book report on it and there were people begging to read it when i was done.. I just bought this and im looking forward to reading it again
4,Uglies- Book 1 of Series of Uglies (four books total),"I don't give you the plot because...well its a simple plot and I rather give you an impression...an inclinationThe Series of The Uglies- Book 1- UgliesDespite the gaping holes in the plot and loose interplay with minor and major figures I do like the first book. Its a breeze to read. Give yourself a week if you are busy. Intriguing and banal at the same time. The tension is bound up in this trans-formative surgery when you turn 16 years old. Everybody becomes pretty because it eases social tensions and levels the playing field.Conceptually, the contrast between Tally and Shay at the end really play up the brain lesions in the frontal lobe. I'm intrigued by the problem of finding a cure (pills made in a hollow building with NOTHING to make them is questionable, but...I like the ideas in the series.) So, I'll buy the next book. I am not rushing for it, but I recommend buy the box set."
5,Uglies,"I love this book, and the whole series. The point it makes is wonderful, and I love the metaphors the author makes. It's a little hard to figure out at first, what is going on (figuring out they're in the future, and the Rusties are our people today, or our near future selves) but after figuring that out, it's a wonderful book."
5,Uglies,"A friend of mine is a 6th grade teacher who regularly reads YA fiction for ideas for the classroom. She, and other teachers, all loved this book. I was looking for something interesting, so I picked it up. I've since read all four in the series and gave Uglies as a gift to my boyfriend's 12 year old daughter. This past Christmas, she asked for the rest of the series, including Bogus to Bubbly. I very much enjoyed these books, as each one has a differnet lesson to teach. I was surprised at how invested I became in the lives of Tally and her friends and think that this book, and the rest of the series, are must reads for middle schoolers."
3,Not really ugly....,"I guess I expected a little bit more out of this book. However, I really like the idea of it, and the issues that the author brought to light because they are so relevant to girls today.There were parts of the book that I thought could have been better, such as the Tally/David romance, or Tally's character development; and I think it would have been helpful to have a little bit more description of the setting and some of the technology used in the futuristic world of this book.I realize that this book was aimed towards young teen girls though (I'm 22 years old), and keeping that in mind, it was very interesting for light, summer vacation reading. Overall, it's a nice little story and I look forward to reading Pretties. Kudos to Scott Westerfeld for creating a book with a positive message for today's teens."
3,Left wanting,"I love post-apocalyptic reads...this one didn't disappoint. The only thing that bothered me was the main character Tally...she had too much of a 360 change from being the brainwashed ugly to the better informed one, but oh well, I'm still excited to finish the series!I really enjoyed how three hundred years into the future things haven't changed that much. Everyone still cares about looking perfect and not being happy for who they are on the inside and not what they look like on the outside. I think it's a great story on learning to break out of society's ideas of beauty and to find one's own beauty and for that I really enjoyed this novel."
5,Best series I've read in a while,"I initially chalked this series up as yet another teenage girl coming-of-age story, but my wife and daughter kept telling me I'd love them. So I tried Uglies, and could't put them down until I had read all 4 (Uglies, Pretties, Specials, and Extras). It's a post-apocalyptic future in which the populace is tightly managed through age segregation and chemical/surgical manipulation. It has the feel of Orwell's 1984, but with a modern flare and some eye glitter. I've had just about enough of the crappy superhero movies, and am hoping someone grabs hold of this series and brings it to film. They'll be a hit."
5,Excellent read,"This is unlike any YA book I've read. It captured my attention and kept it. When I was finished, I immediately downloaded the next installment, Pretties. I'd recommend it to everyone."
4,Worth reading,"This book, although not as good as some YA I've recently read (Unwind and Hunger Games, for instance) is still worth reading. The story is fast moving and message conveyed is positive. Characters are a little flat and ending seemed somewhat forced, but I am ready for the next installment nevertheless."
2,Boring,"ok. well, this book is not that bad but its not super OMG good either. i mean it has a good idea and interesting plot but the style is just boring.. i have to read this becuz im in the reaidng bowl and i literally have to forced myself to read it...i hate it because there's so much descriptions and jsut not the poetic or precise ones, just randomness. blabalabla. the part when tally followed shay's clues to get to the smokies was confusing and too much so i jsu skipped it..and the ending about the escape was too easy and i hate it how david forgive tally so easily -wheres the tragedy????"
3,...,"Welcome to a world 300 years in the future. A world where everyone gets to be beautiful when they turn 16, at that age you undergo an operation that ""turns you from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty."" You live in a beautiful party mansion in New Pretty Town with other Pretties and have all the fun you want; and Tally Youngblood will be there in a few short weeks.Tally's friend Shay isn't so sure she wants to become pretty and runs away to live in the wild. Doing so is not approved of by the authorities (though it does happen every once in a while) and they give Tally a choice: Track down and find Shay and bring her back or never become pretty at all."
2,boring,"I had to be assigned this book for my language arts class. it was kind of boring and it just wasn't really interesting for me. I sometimes enjoy science fiction and stories about worlds different from ours (like the giver by lois lowry) but this was boring. Also my friend says the only reason why scott westerfeld wrote this book is because he was ugly and he was jealous of pretty people. Ok, it may have been mildly interesting in the beginning but then things just started to go downhill. This is just not the book for me. A waste of my 8 bucks. I am definatly not reading any of the sequels. Everyone knows sequels are rarely better than the orinal, first book. And if the original first book wasn't very good in the first place, the sequel will NEVER be any better."
2,Unrealistic,"I read this book two years ago, when I was in fourth grade. I found it great at first, but then as I read on, I saw it very unrealistic. The amount of detail spent on the looks of the character made me feel as though I really couldn't connect to any of the charaters. After finishing the book, I promptly threw it across my living room in disgust. I think I really lost brain cells while reading this book.What I actually did enjoy about this book was the overall PLOT LINE! If becoming ""pretty"" wasn't such an important part of this book, then I actually probably would have enjoyed this book. But PrettyTown?! Really? Couldn't have come up with a better title for a fantasy land, no, too hard. Do NOT waste any of your money on this book. Please.Thank you.Jenna Boccio"
4,luved this book!,"Thought this book was great. It was unique and different. At first cassia was naive and selfish,but then she realizes tjat she doesnt want to be ""pretty"". Definately would recommend it and cant wait to get the next one!!!"
3,Great Book,This book was more than I expected. It was full of imagination that the author created and seemed real. The characters also seemed real.It was an adventure that kept you interested and wanting more.
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I am a huge fan of dystopian novels, and ""Uglies,"" the first in a series of four, did not disappoint. Sure, I wanted to reach out and slap the protagonist a few times, but I thought it was fascinating to watch her reactions over the course of the book. I was also intrigued by some of the concepts and plot points that were introduced later in the book, and I am really looking forward to finding out how it all ties together in subsequent books. I've already picked up ""Pretties"" and can't wait to read it!"
4,Fantastic Series!!!,"Didn't expect to like it but I did! Just goes to show definitely don't judge a book by its cover, it was entertaining and I love dystopias like this!"
4,suprising!,"This book touches subjects that, although harsh now, open the readers eyes to a new way of thinking. Do we really base such a large amount of our opinions of looks? Do we really cut down trees for useless things? Do we really encourage wars over material objects? With a futuristic spin that leaves you wondering more about the way we might live in the future, Uglies is a book that is refreshing and a good read.It is similar to the book Exodus, as it points out flaws in the way we live now and what effects it might have in the future. It takes a while to get used to the enviroment that the book portrays, but you soon get used to it. Although I feel as if more could be known about the background and childhood of the main characters, it was nice to puzzle things out for youself.This book offers adventure, romance and a good read.Jessica, 14"
4,Another good book,"It's a good book. It takes you somewhere else, you wouldn't ever imagine yourself, but you identify with the characters and find commonalities with them so it's within reach. It's a fun, fast read. Definitely young adult fiction, but I really enjoy that it challenges our current culture and makes you question the world around you. Another good book."
3,Has a lot of potential,"This book has a lot of the framework for a good post-apocalyptic/dystopian tale. Unfortunately, it gets too preachy in places, like the author is beating his readers over the head with his message. Even with the repeating lessons in self-esteem/self-reliance, the characters are fleshed out just enough to keep you involved."
2,"Narcissistic teenage girls, this book is for you!","When I picked up this book, it was not in the youth section. False advertising!!! I really felt there should have been some warning before I wasted half a day reading this. The writing is completely one-dimensional. This could've been an epic novel, but instead it is a predictable teen love story/clichéd action adventure. If you are an adult looking for a really insightful book, keep looking. If you are a teenage girl of low to average intelligence, this may be the book for you."
3,"Pretty good, but it got a little boring","It took me a pretty long time to read this book. Lets just say I couldn't get into it. Some of the chapters were slow, ecspecially in the beginning when you first meet Tally. Overall it was not a bad read, but it could've been a little more interesting"
1,I dont get it,"I dont like to write bad reviews, specially since this book has so many good ones, in fact I have to admit that is the reason why I read it untill 11%. The idea is good, but there is no development or explanations. I dont know what the interface ring does or where the parents of the uglies are since they are for sure pretties. Ant then the obvious stuff: uglyville, new pretty town, dullsville, etc. Come on, Im sure a professional writer could do better.Maybe Im tough because Ive read many YA dystopian novels and I can compare this one to those, I dont know, I just dont like Uglies."
1,Ender,"I got hooked into the genre with hunger games and divergent. After reading reviews - I thought Uglies would be a good read. However, it was horrible. The characters were shallow and the story line went nowhere. I could not even finish the book (which is rare since I hate to waste money on things I don't read). Don't waste your time!"
5,This book is a must read,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is fast paced, descriptive, exciting and thought provoking what more can you ask for in a sci-fi book. I can't wait to read the sequel."
2,I've read this story before and it was better then...,"Biting the Sun (or Don't Bite the Sun)by Tanith Lee was published in 1999. It's a very similar premise, but the story is significantly more interesting and frankly, the writing is much better."
3,Uglies by Scott Westerfeld,"When I first picked up this book, I thought the premise was very intriguing. A world full of beautiful people sounds like Heaven. But as I got into the book more and more, it sounded more like you know where! It took me a few chapters to really become engrossed in the book Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. I was waiting for all the excitement to start happening. The story is based around Tally Youngblood, an ugly about to turn pretty. She meets Shay, an ugly that doesn't want to turn pretty. Shay runs away and Tally is forced to bring her friend home or never turn pretty. The events that follow start building up to the climax. After the climax, the story doesn't really slow down. The last sentence in the book will chill you to the bone and make you very excited about the next book. After a slow start, I really started to care about Tally and her friends. I can't wait to read the next book in the series, Pretties."
3,mildly entertaining,"This is the first and best book of the series. Nowhere near Hunger Games quality, but entertaining enough. If you're bored after this one, don't continue, they only get worse."
4,Good Foundation...,"This story is filled with great ideas and a wonderful look on current, and future, society. I want to see a lot more character development. This is a great start though. Keep improving and keep up the good work."
4,Good book!!!,"Uglies is a great book for people who love science fiction novels. It is an easy read and keeps you wanting to read more. In Uglies there are 2 different worlds; Pretty and Ugly. They are both separated by a bridge that connects them both. Every teen turns pretty by an operation at 16 and that boy/girl can enter the Pretty world. The Pretty world is high-tech and the dream place to be.In Uglies, the main character is Tally. She dreams about her ""operation"" and cannot wait to turn pretty. A few weeks before Tally's operation, she meets a new friend Shay. Shay is very adventurous and rather live life on the edge. Shay shows Tally a different perspective on the pretty side. One day Shay runs away and Tally is the only one who might know where she is. When the authorities find out, they give her two options: 1. to find Shay and turn her in, or 2. Never be able to turn pretty at all."
2,"The Uglies: Great Idea, but no follow through.","I know many people will hate me for saying this, but after reading the Uglies Series I felt unsatisfied by what I had read. It was such an amazing idea to go on, but it felt like the author barely scratched the surface of what it could be. Normally I can fall into any book and read it very quickly, but every time I sat down I had to reread because I wasnt truly enjoying it. Maybe Uglies just wasnt my kind of book. The story does not flow beautifully or keep you on edge, it jerks you around and not in a good way."
5,Great Book. :o),This was a great book that draws you in. It is like Hunger Games in a way but without the gory parts. Really loved it so I am buying the second in the series.
3,Could have been so much better.,"Let's just get this out of the way: I will read the rest of them. That being said, the dialogue is horrible. Westerfeld clearly does not know how real teenagers talk to one another. And did anybody feel how weird it was for Tally to be so passionately kissing at that age? The premise is genius. If it were to be made into a movie, the screenwriter would have to create brand new dialogue, or heavily edit what he has to work with. Dear Mr. Westerfeld, go visit a high school campus. Mentor middle school writers. Maybe you'll get a glimpse of how they speak and act."
2,Curious?,"Unfortunately, this book was poorly written. So poorly written I could only read a couple of pages at a time before putting it down and coming back to it another day. Sure, I initially picked up the book understanding it is a young adult novel - probably not a literary novel - I can give it some forgiveness. But the writting was so immensely juvenile I felt I was reading a book meant for 8 year old children. My forgiveness can only extend so far. I am curious why this book is so popular. Sure, I can give it 2 stars for originality."
3,The heart is great. The writing isn't.,"The concepts and the heart are great--one might read it as a non-religious meditation on Proverbs 31:30 and 1 Peter 3:3. Maybe that's why it seems that so many Christian women seem to like this series.However, the writing isn't great. To be fair, it isn't horrifyingly ugly, but it isn't especially pretty, either.Writing: 3/5Plotting: 3/5Concepts & heart: 4/5"
3,slow start but best finish,Uglies:This is a great book in a great series. Someone told me that this book was not that great but I thought I would read it. I saw where my friend was coming from but this was not that bad of a book. It kinda had a confusing begging but as it got deaper into the story it grew better and better. I would recomend this book because there is just something about it that makes it great. I have never liked sci-fi I could never finish a sci-fi book. Not saying that their are not any great sci-fi books but this one is one that you just get hooked on. The author at the end of each book leaves you craving more. This book is so intriging. But this is a series you shouldn't give up on. If you don't like the first book I am almost positive you will like the next books. The books get less complicated as you move on. If you do not like the book the book like I say nothin' ventured nothin' gainedd. If you like series these books are probaly perfect.
3,I need to stay away from young adult books!,"An OK book. Quick read, but not the most original concept. A chapter from the next book, ""Pretties"" is included at the end, and I swear the number of times the word ""bubbly"" showed up was enough to put me off the series entirely. I understand it's the whole point of being a ""pretty"" and how they talk, but I refuse to read dialog that sounds remotely like listening to a slang-ridden tween who can't speak properly."
3,For young adults,"I started to read this book because I got the series for my sister who barely reads and she seemed to like them. I did like this book generally I thought the writing could of been better and the descriptions of things could of been thought out and more descriptive. I have read the synposis for the other books and I don't like the direction of where these books are heading. I think it totally goes agaisnt the whole premise of the book and what you are suppose to take from it. I also would like the author to not think I am a total idiot and I don't need everything spelled out for me. I understand the premise of the book and what he is trying to convey to people, but I feel as though he is shoving it down my throat and not letting me figure it out on my own.This book is for young adults you can tell by the way he writes, so I do recommend it just realize it is a very bland way of story telling to me."
2,dissapointing and misleading,"I ordered this book on May 5, and I did not recieve it in the mail untill May 29! I was dissapointed in how long it took them to deliver one small book. Also, the cover was not the same as advertised. I was expecting the cover shown but instead a different one came. The other cover shows naked, headless, chopped up barbie dolls laying in whats looks like a thing you are supposed to throw up into. I was dissapointed with this."
1,sorry for 1 star,"I read this book. this book made me sleephead and boring. It is my opinion. this book is not my type. I like to romance books, fantesy ,and true story."
4,Uglies Review,"Could you imagine a society where everyone looks the same and no one is ugly? In Tally's world, everyone gets to be pretty at the age of sixteen.Or do they? I thought this book had some thought provoking material and was an easy read. The story was realistic even though there were some parts that seemed a little far fetched like the attack on the Specials in the end. There are a couple of themes to the story as well. I felt the characters in the story were likable and easy to relate to. They had ideas and feelings of teens today. I would recommend this book to others and am looking forward to reading the next in the series, Pretties."
5,Not your typical YA book,"Westerfeld's imagination and writing is extraordinary. Every person wishes at some point in their life that they were more beautiful or that they could just change something on their body. Westerfeld takes this idea and turns it around on us. This is not your typical young adult book, this gets you thinking, thinking about morals and what's under the surface of that ""Barbie"" type girl."
5,Great book with conspiratorial views!,"It only takes about a chapter to really get into the book, but once you are you can't set the book down. What I liked most about the book were the views the author had on how the ""Rusties"", or us 21st century people, destroyed the world with our careless ways with the environment. I was agreeing with the book, and it really shows how overrated prettiness is. I recommend this book to anyone who's up to reading an incredibly well-written book."
3,"Great story idea, if you are under 14","Really great idea for a story, but could not get past the juvenile writing. Yes this is a young adult book, but it was so childish at times that I had a hard time getting through it. Not sure if I will continue the series, to be honest the only real motivation I had to finish the book was so that I could start something different."
4,I enjoyed it more than I expected to . . .,"My daughter (who is 12) read this series and recommended it to me. She and I share a love of fantasy / sf novels, and we often trade books back and forth.I thought this series would be a bit juvenile, and yes, it is definitely targeted for teens. However, it is also well written and entertaining, with some fascinating concepts centered around a dystopian-but-hopeful future society. If you are a fan of light science fiction, dystopian fiction, or ""futures imperfect"" type stories, you will enjoy it I think. It's a quick read and a real page-turner.This is the first book in the series, and was my second-favorite (I liked ""Pretties"", the second novel, better.) Enjoy!"
3,"interesting, but couldn't finish the series","I liked this book okay. It's another series about a dystopian society, but not nearly as clever as the Hunger Games. The characters started to annoy me after a while. I finished the first 2 or 3 books of the series, but wasn't interested enough to finish. Although to be honest, I don't read alot of fiction anymore. If you really like books like Hunger Games, Matched, etc. then you'll probably enjoy these books, otherwise it might be a waste of time."
3,Good Premise but Windy,"This is your classic Brave New World rewrite. It is YA, but I couldn't get through it all the way, and neither could my teen daughter. The writing is fairly good, the idea is pretty cool, but somehow it just doesn't get anywhere. For a long time, the main character doesn't really have a goal they are trying to get to. And as they ""go off the grid"" and start meeting people in other circles, there's this strange feeling that comes over the reader that the author doesn't really know how his world works. It feels like he is making it up as he goes along, and could have used an outline."
5,The BEST Book Ever!,"I LOVE this book. I borrowed it from a friend and I finished it in a few hours. The story just pulls you in. I couldn't put it down! I was dissapointed when the story ended as a cliff-hanger! I can't wait to read Pretties, the second book in the series.This book is set in futuristic society and is about a fifteen-year-old 'ugly' named Tally. She is turning sixteen in a few weeks and can't wait. When people turn sixteen, they have an operation to turn 'pretty'. They get their whole body changed. Tally has a friend named Shay, who doesn't want to turn pretty. Shay runs away to a different society that lives like we do today. Then Tally is forced to find Shay under the treat that if she doesn't bring her back to the city, she will never turn pretty. Tally is torn between turning in Shay, but turning pretty and not turning Shay in, but not becoming pretty. If you want to find out what happens to Shay and Tally, read this book."
3,good YA book,"This seems like a good young adult book, but not as mind blowing as I'd thought it'd be based on reviews. I do love some books like the Hunger Games which are also considered YA, but this book didn't really surprise me at any time. I'm glad I read it, but it was a bit meh--the general plot/characters seems pretty overused as well as the whole 'pretty inside' take away--thus I think it's really geared more towards kids/much younger crowd than expected that haven't been jaded yet :)"
2,Not for adults,Some of the young adult books are ok for people of all ages this one however is very juvenile and simple. It is prob pretty good book for jr high age maybe some highschoolesr but any older and you will be bored. Not quite the excitement and drama as the hunger games or twilight or even Harry potter. Not a bad book just very specified age wise.
4,Uglies,This book the Uglies is a very interesting story. It is all about a girl in this future world where everyone turns pretty when they turn 16. It gets really good as one of her friends doesn't want to become pretty and runs away.
5,Uglies,"The book I read was Uglies by Scott Westerfeld. I have never read a book by Westerfeld but I am going to read more I can tell you that. This book is about a girl named Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen then to get her license to turn pretty. Where tally comes from your sixteenth berthday brings an operation that turns your body from ugly to stunningly gorgeous.In a few months she will be sixteen and will get to be pretty like all her freinds before her.Tally's new friend Shay isn't positive that she wants to be pretty yet. She'd rather risk her life in the outside world then turn pretty like Tally wants to. When Shay runs away to this far away city that Tally doesn't even beleive in Tally learns a new way of life as an Ugly.This is a very interesting book and i really enjoyed reading it, most of the time i couln't put it down! I would like to read the second one which is called The Pretties by the same author. I recomend this book to all other adventerous reader."
5,Interesting book,"If you like futuristic stories this book will make a great addition to your collection. The main characters are teenagers living in a society, in a not very far future, where at the age of 16 everyone undergoes some plastic surgery to become `pretty'. There is of course a resistance group and the story will develop into a great thought provoking romance thriller."
3,Boring but interesting enough,A bit slow but the premise is really interesting. There wasn't much action until the end. There were just a few bits of excitement here and there throughout the book but for the most part I felt most parts went on and on for far too long. I will say that it ended interestingly enough that I want to read the second book.
3,Uglies,"The Uglies is an o.k. book in the beginning. I would give the book three stars. Tally was one of the characters; she was brave, courageous she is the main character. In the book Tally goes off and meets a girl named Shay and they have a big adventure.The beginning of the book was good. But towards the end of the book, it started to get boring. It seemed to go on and on. I really wouldn't recommend this book unless you like really long books. During the book it stopped pulling me in. I would also recommend this book to adults who read. Overall the book was o.k. thats my review.(...)"
1,frustrating read,I understood the concept. It was great. But couldn't stand reading Tally. And the weird lingo. I only kept reading because I needed to know what happened
4,Worth the read,"I wasn't a big fan of dystopian novels when I began reading this, but I am now. He created a believable world filled with misunderstanding, mixed messages, and teen angst even for an adult reader like myself can relate to. The MC's journey to the discovery of the truth is an interesting one to follow. There's a message that reflect the current view of what teenagers and adults find attractive and how important it is to our self-esteems. But he didn't do symbolism to death. Also, the author did an excellent job of writing the voice of a 15-year-old girl. I'm his new fan now. I'll be reading his books again."
2,Bored to tears,"It just didnt do it for me. I struggled to finished because of how boring it was. The story line is SLOW, dull, and doesnt grasp attention"
5,This book is amazing,This book is amazing. One of the best books I've read by far!!!! Definitely in the top 5 truly amazing.
5,Best book I've read,This is a great book for teenagers and young adults. It's science fiction that keeps you guessing with a little bit of romance
4,"Standard YA novel, but cool tech","This is a pretty standard trilogy of a Young adult novel - young girl in a not-so-near post-apocalyptic future, thrust into the middle of a struggle between ""good"" and ""evil"", in love with boy A in first novel, in love with boy B in second, and choosing between the two in the third. That said, I still couldn't put any of the books down until I was done with them. A nice variation on our possible future and a pretty original ""end of the world"" scenario. I enjoyed all three books and recommend them if you liked the Hunger Games."
4,A personal favorite!,"This series is amazing! Very original, clever, and fun to read. If you like science fiction, a must read!"
1,"Intriguing plot, but just didn't do it for me","I love reading Young Adult Fiction and after seeing this book as a recommendation from other books I've enjoyed, I jumped right in. The plot and characters seemed intriguing, but the book started off very slow. I thought it would pick up but it never did. I just couldn't finish it, I felt like this was too Young adult for me. I couldn't get past the easy read, words like ""Uglies,Pretties & Littlies"" and I felt no no real suspense or development. Overall I think I just felt too old to read it or enjoy it. This is a very young read."
3,My Thoughts,"Okay, I'm editing my previous review. This book is quite alright. Not as good as expected, but maybe because I built it up to much. The sequels were good. but I preferred the sequels to the first. My opinion. I'm just being honest."
1,A little too Young Adult,"I agree with the reviewer who said this may have been a little too Young Adult for their taste. While I found the concept to be interesting, I found the book to be lacking. The characters weren't likable, and I found the main character to be annoying. While romances in these books are never believable, this one was just awkward and disappointing. I figured I would give this YA book a chance because I really enjoyed The Hunger Games and despite my criticisms for it the Twilight series was actually an enjoyable, quick read. Maybe I've exhausted the list of YA books that I would find enjoyable."
2,Not great,"I know this book is pretty popular, but I don't understand why. I normally love this type of book, but I found this book completely lacking. The characters were dull and not developed. I had no interest in finishing the series."
5,scotts books,i personaly love all of scotts books he has made this whole world in his books its really quite intresting
2,Ehhh...,It was a good first book to the series but if it wasn't for the romance it would have nothing pulling it forward in my opinion...I guess I feel it was a shallow read.
5,Not ugly at all,"In a post-apocalyptic world where looks and beauty are standardised Tally Youngblood is about to turn 16... and pretty.Tally is an ugly and about to receive an extensive operation that every ugly receive when they turn 16 to make them pretty. The only problem is her best friend's run away to a rumoured rebel base called The Smoke and now Tally's in trouble with Special Circumstances.She's given the option of going and finding The Smoke to help all the runaways or staying ugly forever.From the first word Tally's voice leapt off the pages and immediately drew me into her world. There's plenty of action, suspense and questions to keep the pages turning to find out what's going to happen. I know the whole cosmetic surgery idea is not an original idea, but Scott Westerfeld gives a unique spin on things and along with some new inventions (bungy jackets) marks it for a good read."
3,The Devil is in the Details,"I love to read young adult books- some are so brave and they address issues adult books haven't gotten around to yet. This is that kind of book. The set-up, the world created, is great-very imaginative. There are some problems though. Tally is beyond innocent at the beginning of the book- she is...well...kind of stupid and annoying. Also, the plot went the way I expected. All this might mean that I would rate the book lower. However, Tally does slowly get a bit better character-wise. In addition, the well created and imagined world in which the book takes places deserves revisiting. Therefore, I would recommend the book with some reservation, while I myself will move on to reading Pretties."
1,HORRIBLE Ending to a use to be perfect fantasy,"I used to love all thea devine's book and satisfaction is one of my favorite. I love the characters Jancie and Lujan, especially the way Lujan realized in the book how much he loves Jancie and happily throw away his jaded ways to be with her. I want to buy Sensation because I would like to see what happen afterward with Jancie and Lujan. Now, normally, I would read the customer reviews on Amazon first to see what I am getting into, but I was in a hurry this time so I didnt. At the book store, I sort of scan through it and flip to read the ending first (hard to break a habit). OH MY GOD!!! I was aboslutely horrified of Thea's revealing of Lujan's character! And the dissapearing of Jancie and Hugan!! I was so horrified that I drop the book right then and there. There's no way I buy and much less read it now. I have just one question to Ms. thea: WHY? WHY? OH WHY???"
1,What were YOU thinking Ms.Devine?,"I RARELY write or comment on a book. Except for Passion (lisa Valdez) Fantastic book. However this sequel to Sensation if called that was HORRIBLE and SHAMEFUL in it's destruction of the redeeming and healing way Janice love transforms Lujan, the brother of this books character Kyger. To use this book to destroy her,and her life. Was shameful. Kyger, in this story if called that was not even defined or left to grow and flourish. Rather he was hidden in the pit literally of the scam of what is Lujans life. Do Ms Devine make this up to your readers by letting us know that all was not in vain for Janice or Lujan. Who both disappeared in this fiasco of a book. HOW you can bring about the phoenix and restoration of Lujan to his Janice. NOW that's a story. The power of Love. How about it? We readers could use a dose of GOODWILL and PEACE, in these times. DO SERIOUSLY consider to write this tale. I can tell you you'll have alot of readers for this story."
2,"Free is good, but the translation is frustrating at times","This is an old translation and it shows in its maddening inconsistancies. For example, rather than simply referring to the protagonist as Roland, he is called ""Rollant,"" ""Rollanz"";Ganelon, the treacherous Frank, is referred to as ""Guenes""; Charlemagne goes by at least three other names (Carlun?). Other archaic spellings dominate too, like ""Mahumet"" for Muhammed, and gafaluns for whatever they might be.The syntax and diction are stiff and unnatural and line breaks are not noted. Here's a taste:""His arms to bear has shewn great lustihead; In vassalage he is well famoused; Christian were he, he'd shown good barronhead.""So, it is a great story, but the best thing about this version is its price."
1,Clunky Translation and formatting,"This is a review of the free Kindle edition (with the Green and Beige cover).1. Note this is the 1919 Translation by C.K. Moncreiff, and is not an easy read. (not being a reader of old French, I can't speak to it's accuracy)2. FORMATTING: This is not a prose piece. The translation is in verse, but the format of the Kindle edition is not in lines of poetry, but in paragraphs.3. When one goes to the ""Click to Look Inside!"" we appear to be looking at a Dover edition with translation by John O'Hagan. (THIS translation btw looks very readable.) NOT the actual Kindle edition."
3,poetic,"although the song of Roland is a very poetic, i just could not follow the story, this rating is my own opinion, i know many historians that believe this is one of the most beautiful stories ever written."
4,EXAGERATES A BIT BUT...,"well worth the time. Sure, it gets a little repitious, but you really get a feel of how important knighthood and chivalry were to these people so lang ago.Not a must-read, but definitely worth the time for leisurely reading, especially if you enjoy history or just heroic epics."
3,Pretty Pictures! (But don't expect a How-To or a story),"The illustrations are gorgeous!Unfortunately, in picture after picture (not ALL, but way too many) the arms are in the wrong position in relation to the legs, which is a very unbalanced thing for a young child to try to imitate... and the beautifull illustrations are so engrossing that it's hard to explain to a youngster that the picture is showing either the wrong leg forward or the wrong arm up...The so-called story is lacking any real plot, but then, that isn't why you buy this book anyway. Any young child will really really love the artwork. And unlike many other books on ballet, this one shows children, so little girls relate to it in a more personal way.Buy it for the pictures, but for a how-to of steps and positions, get a different book that is more accurate."
1,shallow and predictable,"i have read better books! karen Robards is generally consitant in providing one with a good and even great story. however, she missed the mark here. i found the characters shallow and the story predictable. come on karen ... you can do better!"
2,Not up to Karen Robards previous standards,"Usually, I really like her books, but I was disappointed with this one. I thought it was pretty good up until the ""saving the world"" bit. Pretty far-fetched & kind of rushed & goofy at the end. I also didn't care for ""Hunter's Moon"" for a lot of the same reasons. Her earlier books, ""Night Magic"", ""Walking After Midnight"" were much better. I think she can do a better job. It will make me more hesitant about reading anymore of her books."
2,Not what I expected...,"Gees, I was really let down on this book. The plot really grabbed my attention, but I could not stand Lynn! She was so rude and snotty...she ruined the book for me. Don't waste your money on this flop!"
2,Least Favorite Robards Book,"I bought this book after reading the reviews here and also because I've enjoyed the last three Robards books I've read. This one was not at all as enjoyable to me as the other three I read (Superstition, Whispers at Midnight and Paradise County). Maybe I'm just not a wilderness or cowboy kind of girl because the romance aspect was just ok to me, and the supense, while some parts were pretty good, mostly bored me. I just didn't care for this one, but I love Karen Robards normally so I'll continue to keep reading herbooks."
2,ehhh... unbelivable and pretty annoying,"First of all I hated how the hero began the book by hitting on the heroines teenage daughter... very annoying! I never found anything that good about him, and she was whiney and annoying. Definitely not one of her best. The subplot was very lame and unbelievable... don't bother!!"
3,Good start-bad ending,"This Robard's book was a disappointment. The first half held me in its grasp, making me want to read faster and faster but I could only shake my head once the good guys and bad guys met. From that point, it became unrealistic. Did not care for the ""end of the world"" scenario and how conveniently everything happened for the good guys. For example, when the good guys were cornered and going to be killed, oops, the rock plateau falls and all but one terrorist is killed and this one happens to think that maybe his associates might have been mistaken in their beliefs. Get real! Sorry Karen, I love most of your action/thrillers but this was a major dissapointment."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Good, Either!!!","I ordered this book from the States, waited two months for it, and paid thirty-five aussie dollars. Was it worth it? Well, not really! I should have just waited for the paperback. It wasn't classic Robards as far as I'm concerned. This book should come under the category of Adventure not Romance. It was more of a lust story than a love story. It was okay, but nothing spectacular. Give me ""Tiger's Eye"" or ""Dark of The Moon"" any day."
2,Zippo Tricks,The transaction went without a hitch but the DVD was a joke but not the sellers fault....All in all A+ to the seller Thanks
1,sux,i borrow this video from a friend and i didn't learn a thing. i watched it like 4 times at least and its just a horrible instructional video. but if u really want to waste ur time and money go ahead and buy it
3,Not very good quality,"I have this in ""Candy Sweets"" , and the colors pictured online are a lot darker than they actually are when you get it. The eyeshadows are more of a pastel, and go on very lightly. You have to apply a lot to get a good color. I've only used they eyeshadows once since its not very good quality. It just seem like the pigments aren't very good."
3,You get what you pay for,"I usually buy Lancme products, but since I go through eyeshadows quickly, I decided to try something inexpensive. Avon's product is not the best, but not the worst either. The colors are a little softer, which is perfect for the daytime. If you like something a little more intense, try Stilla (which is pricy, but worth every penny)."
4,Shadows Light gets my vote!,I thought Shadows Light was a very well-done movie! The acting was superb; the story was captivating; the special effects were very professional. I was so impressed by the trailer that I simply had to buy it! I'm glad I did.
4,Shadows Light--A Pleasant Surprise,"When I popped this DVD in, I was expecting the same type of ""low budget quality"" that you'd get from most independent films, but I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the film amazed me, the picture was crisp and the scenes were shot with precision!The story was very easy to follow (due to great pacing) and the effects were far above average. However, what amazed me the most was the acting. Not a single weak actor was in this feature. Kudos to the filmmakers!"
2,eh.,I expected Shadow LIight to be a lot better. I am only giving it two stars out of the five. It was leaning towards corny.
2,Shadows Light,I couldn't finish watching this movie and it was certainly not worth the money I spent to rent it. I would not recommend watching it even if it is free!
1,And then...And then...And then...,"I have never taken the time to write a review for...well, anything. I barely made it through the sample as the whole thing felt like reading one giant run on sentence; I couldn't stop. I breathed a sign of relief at the end feeling like I had read the whole thing in one breath. The story seemed like it had potential...if you can pick it out of the superfluous, haphazard teenage babble."
5,You'll never wanna put it down,"If you are interested in American pop culture and teenage life in conflict with the suburbs and cities, this is for you. Girl is one of my favorite books. I first read it in 8th grade, when I noticed its hot pink color in the library. I promise you, even if things about the story bug you (it's written the way teens talk, pretty much), you'll still have trouble putting the book down till you've read the whole thing. Blake Nelson, if you're reading this, Puhleeease write a sequel!"
4,What an HONEST book!,"It's an honest book, in which everyone can find something from their years at high school. The language is necessarily not a masterpiece in terms of literature but it's REAL, you can feel it, and I highly reccommend it to everyone along with his second novel Exile which I loved even more than this one."
3,when you're unsure,"I understand why people wouldn't like this book because it's not that greatest portrayal of teenagers today or whatever but it was addictive to me and when wondering if you should buy or read this book, read the little intro and if you want to know more/read on or can relate and think you'll like it I say go for it but be prepared to deal with one of those girls who doesn't fit in a high school clique and was probably a groupie in a past life."
3,Oh my...,"I first heard of the novel Girl through a magazine review. It called it, ""out of this world."" And so it is. Out of my world anyway. I found the carachters to be brazen and un-caring, with a holier that thou attitude. The characters (signaling Andrea and Matthew) participate in sex with just about anyone. The part that really made me mad was when a card of some sort was passed around the class room, for and sick student, and classmates blantly refused to sign it. I found that the characters moved through people to stay ahead of the game and only thought of themselves. Is this teenage life? For some, yes. For me? No, it never was and never will be."
3,"sometimes pleasing, sometimes insulting, and a let down","If i had read this book at 14 and had not yet seen the movie i would have loved it. however the movie is my all time favorite and the book does not live up. I feel like he tried to hard to sound like a teenage girl. And Andrea come off as sounding stupid at first. I really had a hard time with a male author trying to write like a teenage girl. Some times he pulled it off, sometimes not so much. Bottom line if you saw the movie chances are you wouldn't appreciate this book as much as if you could have. However most people will fall somewhat in love with the story and really root for Andrea. Even if you get annoyed with the book along the way."
3,'My So-Called-Life' in soft-back,"It's refreshing to find 'teenage fiction' which spotlights an alternative to the glossy 'he-let-me-hold-his-football-and-I-almost-died' novel. If those fluffy romances are cherry-ade, then 'Girl' is Budweiser. It's not perfect - occasionally the references and ideas are embarrassingly misguided and self-aware, but it's so easy to read, and such a welcome break from the norm that I recommend it totally."
4,Please don't think I'm rude..,"but I haven't read it yet. After reading all the comments so far it sounds like a great book. How did I happen to find out about it? Jonathan Kahn directed a movie based on this book. It stars Dominique Swain (Lolita), Sean Patrick Flanery (young Indiana Jones), Tara Reid (American Pie), Selma Blair (Cruel Intentions), Portia DeRossi (Ally McBeal), and Christopher Masterson (for those of you already hooked to Malcolm in the Middle). From what I can tell after reading the reviews, the characters have been changed a bit but the basic message is there. I think those of you who have read the book first will be the lucky ones because of the nature of...oh blah. What this boils down to is I recommend the movie and I thank all the reviewers of the book for enticing me to read it."
2,The movie was so much better - that's a sad thing for a book,"I enjoyed the film 'Girl' based on the book by Blake Nelson. It was cute, funny, and had a nice sense of female independance and self discovery. I was disapointed when I bought the book afterward. I found the narrative style very offputting and I was not able to identify with or care about Andrea. What girl speaks like that? The constant repetition of ""and then,"" and the lack of emotional depth made me finally put it down without finishing it. Usually after seeing a film i.e. The Virgin Suicides or The Ice Storm I am so eager to read the book and find out how much richer and complex the written word is. 'Girl' isn't all bad but there are much better books of its genre out there, and as an avid reader of women's fiction I feel like 'Girl' has missed it when it comes to describing what it is to grow up middle class and female in America."
4,The best aspect of this book is Cybil.,"I had a lot of trouble getting into the book at first because the writing is very i-read-seventeen-magazine-as-a-hobby, and the narrator, Andrea, is perhaps one of the most appearance-oriented, obnoxious high school ""rebel"" ever printed. The character of Cybil, however, who enters the story directly after having shaved her head in a moment of indecision and the overwhelming influence of an older, intriguing rock star, made me cry at so many random places. Little things about her really touched me, the way that Andrea describes her picking grass out of her socks... Andrea's character has no bulk, no substance, but Cybil transforms from a semi-popular jock to a completely independent,lost teenager... SHE is who i identified with. I would be in love if she were a real person."
5,I've never related to a book as much as I have this one.,Andrea Marr and I are the same person! It's nice to read a book that can put your life into perspective. I loved every page. It was fast reading and a really good story for adolecent girls like myself. Isn't Andrea in college now? When's that book coming out??!!
5,"""Girl"" Genius","My own girlhood was little more than a blur until I read ""Girl,"" which brought it all back to me. I hate to admit this, but I, too, marvelled that a man could imbue a character with such an identifiably feminine, teen-aged voice.Also, ""Girl"" has the one thing missing from so much fiction these days -- humor! A definite must-read."
5,Is Blake Nelson really a man?,Blake Nelson may have sneaked a peak at my diary before he wrote Girl. Andrea's experiences are my own. Her thoughts are mine. Her words are mine. Any man who can get inside the mind of a teenage girl and so accurately portray that experience has this girl wrapped around his little finger.
3,Victoria's Review,"This book was true to some girls, but a little on the wired side. Blake Nelson did a nice job, but there was things that not many girls could relate too. The sex and social life was good interp, but she wanted to be as cool as a shophmore when see was a senior and wearing cow dresses, who dose that? I let my friend read it and she gave it back to me the next day 'cause she thought it was too weird. I alest read the hole thing. Putting aside the differences, it was well writen and cool. If you like the out-of-the-ordinary this is for you."
4,"Right on, Blake!","I gotta secret for you. He based the subject matter (albeit very loosely) on me (a male) and our early days in the Portland Punk Scene. He switch genders to make it more interesting. My copy was dedicated to ""Jeff, the first `girl'"". Actually, both Blake and I like girls - lots of 'em! And no, neither of us have grown up a bit -we're both in our mid thirties!"
4,Interestingly interesting novel,"This book I found interesting and exciting to read. It seems like she is very energetic for some reason, like she never stops! I think this book is really for teenage girls or even adults. I think Andrea is the typical teenager (apart from some things in the book that some people might not be doing at that age... if you know what I mean!) But all in all I think this is a very enjoyable story and will get all your emotions up and running. There are some quite humourous bits, like when Cybil shaves her hair off, to impress a boy that Andrea ends up with anyway... OK, I will not tell you ANYMORE and you will just have to buy the book to see what other amazing, exciting adventures happen to Andrea throughout her hectic high school life!"
4,Der Freshmaker!,"In the Kraftwerk catalogue, Autobahn stands out to me as an anomaly. It's sunny and warm, with kind of a Teutonic Beach Boys feel to it. The eponymous track dominates the album, four german hippies take a roadtrip down the autobahn in an old mercedes. The track starts with a steady highway pulse then gets sunnier, almost as if you're entering the country. This Autobahn isn't about speed, it's a stretch of highway with no other cars for miles and cows on the side of the road.The album is devoid of the menance and irony of later releases and the band has pretty ditched the Krautrock muscle of the first three albums. It's a classic. It also doesn't sound like Kraftwerk."
5,"the last 6 minutes of ""autobahn""...","...is among the most brilliant moments in electronic music. aside from the music which needs no qualifying, i am amazed at the production quality here. i always use the last 6 minutes of ""autobahn"" to test how a new pair of speakers, amplifier, speaker cables, cd player, etc sound with old analog synthesizers. a crappy stereo system does no justice to this recording. these nerds were wayyyyyy beyond ahead of their time."
5,Like,"This compact disc was in very good condition with no scratches, and it had the classic original LP cover art."
5,This is Kraftwerk's Best.,"i just bought this album today and love it. i had the original L.P. when it came out in 1974. i'm glad they put it on c.d. Autobahn is great to meditate to. the kometenmelodie 2 is wonderful too. this is just a super great album. if you like electronic music, this is a must to have."
2,Hardly gets out of second gear,"Asides from a tad of inspired repetition found in the long running title track and the shimmering beauty of Kometenmelodie 2, there is not much to wrap your head around when excessive and primitive electronic experimentation claim center stage."
5,Here's where the forefather started,"Autobahn is such an exquisite piece of electronic music that when I listen to it today in 2005, still sounds as futuristic and utterly modern than what some electronic bands could ever produce. You will absolutely not believe that this 22-minute classic was ever written and recorded in 1974 when computers hardly exist and tracks are recorded low-tech. The title track contain a few breaks, fully synthesized electronics and vocal effects that's way ahead of its time. The second and third tracks are ambiently atmospheric and breathtaking. This album goes to show that no one will ever forget how electronic music came to be today."
4,Maybe I'm Nitpicking,"Autobahn is a seminal classic, living beyond our lifetimes in both the ""electronic"" genre, & in music as a whole. A few comments about the CD:The remastering repro is excellent. The original Vertigo vinyl LP of Autobahn was banded into 7 separate but continuous sections; would have liked to see that here on the CD. Would be interesting for CD players with random track-order scramblers.The 4 other selections are also vintage Kraftwerk, but I would have appreciated at least a few others to fill up the disc, maybe from the frustratingly hard-to-round up Kraftwerk ""1 & 2"" or from ""Ralf & Florian"". Total time of this Autobahn disk 43 minutes.The music is 7-star quality; these observations dock my disk rating to 4 stars."
5,Autobahn,"A Very Good CD And A Very Noticable One From The Early Days Of Electronica. This One Is Still Good Even By Todays Standards Of Electronica. The Track Auotbahn Literally Takes You On A Ride, Down The Autobahn! Cars And Trucks Go Whizzing By And Good Stereo Really Helps Here To Get The Full Enjoyment Of This CD. Lots Of Back & Forth Stuff Going Through Your Speakers. Amazing To Listen To. Some Of The Other Tracks Fall A Little Short, But The 17 Min. Of Autobahn Makes Up for It."
4,Saved thousands of dollars,"I purchased a house recently and decided to replace almost all my furniture. I bought The Furniture Factory Outlet Guide for assistance. I saved literally over $10,000 using this book. My one recommendation to use this guide is to shop your local furniture stores, get the furniture manufacturer's name, the group name and/or number of the pieces you like. Then use the guide to call the stores listed in the guide that carry the furniture manufacturer you're looking for, and price shop, one against the other for the best deals. You really don't even have to go to NC, unless you want to spend a couple days looking and figuring out what furniture you like. Then go home and call the stores in this guide. Good luck and happy shopping."
3,Very basic overview,"I'm moving to the Netherlands next month. I bought this book as I had one from this series when I moved to Kuala Lumpur - that book was invaluable. This one hasn't the same kind of info I had hoped for. The information presented here is interesting and helpful, but not what I was looking for. I've ordered ""The Holland Handbook"" in hopes of finding the info I need."
2,"Too big, wrong hinge, covers voice memo button","Pros:* Hard, attractive, affordableCons:* Bigger than the Rhinoskin case for my Zire 71 (even though the 72 is smaller)* Voice memo button covered* Awkward hinging for us right-handed folks--hard to open and hold when using right hand to writeI'm returning mine and going back to a Rhinoskin."
4,Zire 72 Hard Case,Great hard case for the Zire 72. Great price. Does a great job of protecting the PDA. If you are looking for a hard case for the Zire 72 recommend this one.
2,Very unconfortable!!!!,"The good thing about this hard case is that it'll protect the handheld. Those who are left-handed will have no problems, but us right-handed will find it very unconfortable. Since it does not fully open,(the picture above that displays as open as it can be) the case will be in your way to hold it. An other thing that I didn't like was that in order to retrive the expansion cards held in the hard case, you have to take off first the handled in order to be able to get the cards.I wouldn't recommend this hard case if you are right handed"
1,Would not recommend this case,"I was very eager to get this case for my new Zire 72. It's certainly a beautiful case, but not very functional. The front cover doesn't flip all the way under, so that if you're holding it with your left hand, it's difficult to reach the control buttons with your left thumb, as you should be able to. You cannot access the voice recorder button or the slots for the expansion cards unless you remove your zire from the case. Also, the top and bottom are completely open, which provides ready access to the slots, etc, however it does nothing to protect my zire from debris, etc, from the bottom of my purse. Also, the cradle impedes my access to the stylus slightly.I do like the sliding window in the back that opens so that I can take pictures and video, though."
4,Great protection...,"I am not sure why people are whining about this case so much. It isn't the most ideal fit in your left hand, but it can still be used. The cover opens past 180 degrees, so the picture is not as far as it opens. The protection is great!It may not have a belt loop, so if you need that feature look elsewhere.The protection that this case provides is perfect. I throw it in my bag and don't worry about it. I know this case will protect the screen and entire unit. As noted in other reviews, the sliding camera door lets you take pictures while still in the case and protect the lens when not in use.Overall, this is a great case. I would definitely tell you to get this if you want some more protection for your Zire."
5,The best way to protect your palm.,"Nice, Hard, and very confortable. Protect very well the Palm, but make it a litthe big to carry on pocket."
4,what a twist...,"I've always been a fan of Erika Eleniak since her Playboy and Baywatch days. I think overall,her best movie is Chasers with Tom Berenger. This movie isn't bad. It's got a complex plot and an ending that maybe Hitchcock would have dreamed up sooner or later. In fact i gave it 4 stars for the twist at the end.Erika sadly shows no 'flesh' in this flick but like i said,it's a pretty decent story."
2,"OK Plot, not spectacular...",Well the most important issue is that Erika Eleniak never takes her clothes off during the whole movie. That was quite a let down.
5,Muy LINDOS,"Son muy bellos y sin detalles, a mi esposo le facinaron dice que son super comodos, llegaron en perfecto estado, para la proxima los pido medio numero mas.Suerte"
4,5mhp shoes,"Primarily, I like the message that's written inside the box. Months ago I wanted to buy these pair of shoes cause they look very simple and comfortable. Well, the results were awesome,people started asking me where did I get the shoes? For a driving shoes, the are very innovating, even though I haven't driven with them yet...They just fit with dark, classic or white jeans, chinos (even rolling up the pants to give them protagonist)I can recommend this brand to anyone whose buying luxury and style. The leather's spanish, which means quality and comfort!!"
2,A confusing book inferior to Rheas book on Dow Theory,"I found the book not so interesting even though this is the book that probably is the first Dow Theory book. I would much rather read Richard Russells The Dow Theory Today or Rheas ""The Dow Theory"". Both books are much better written."
5,arrive on time. a good read,"good read and nice book. just as it states.reading through again the 2nd time, just wish I could get it earlier."
3,Not for the faint of heart,"Nicholas Gash is always entertaining but he isn't always informative. Despite best efforts to keep characters straight, track possible motives and alibis and follow a labyrinthine plot, it was still difficult to figure out what the hell was going on. The plot fairly gallops and Lovejoy is truly delightful, but I got a little weary always trying to figure out how things matched up. I will no doubt tackle another Lovejoy soon, but I will need a break before I do so."
3,WORTH A WATCH IF YOU'RE INTO OLD WESTERNS: 3.5 STARS,"JOHN TOBIN [JOHN WAYNE] FINDS HIMSELF HOT ON THE TRAIL OF MEXICAN BANDIT PANDRO ZANTI [EARL DWIRE] AFTER PANDRO KILLS HIS FATHER. A LITTLE DATED, BUT IT'S FUN ENOUGH AND IT HAS ENOUGH ENJOYABLE ACTION TO MAKE THIS A DECENT WESTERN. ALSO, TAKE A LOOK AT THE INCREASING ACTING ABILITY OF THE YOUNG JOHN WAYNE."
1,Country of origin,"Container indicated only a ""made for ..."" product identifier. I assume this is another one of those far east suppliers that have created a lot of attention with product contamination. Recall recent concerns about purity of human vitamins. I will not buy anything but American vitamin supplements for humans and animals. Therefore if the retail distributor will not identify the name and it's source, then it is not for me."
3,Not Awesome,I purchased 2 different spanish word puzzle books. The other one came first and has been fun to work with. This one came today and I have tried several different puzzles and I find the book very confusing. Clues are not given well (or at all) and I'm not really sure what to do most of the time.
4,Love it!!,"We bought this high chair for our daughter and we love it. It's easy to use and set up. I would have given five stars but to unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too ""handy"" when you have a crying baby in one of the them. The seat adjusts up and down so your child can sit right at the table with you. As stated above, the legs fold together so you can store the chair when not using. The chair cover is also easy to take off when it needs to be cleaned(which we do in the tub) and is attached with snaps. My little one is ten months old, 19 pounds, 27.5 inches and not even close to outgrowing this chair. I definitely recommend this chair. Hope this helps!!"
2,Its cute but I've had better high chairs that were less expensive,After 5 boys my first daughter just HAD to have a pink highchair for her Princess 1st Birthday Party so I retired the boys trusty BLUE Graco (still in great shape after 4 years) into the basment and ordered this Pink one. After what we paid for it ~ I don't know how to tell my husband I want the blue one back! (Maybe I can fnd a pink cover?!) My daughter is 12 months old & 20 pounds and cannot reach the tray without dropping food into her lap. There is a 3inch gap between her & the tray so half her food she tries to feed herself drops into her lap. The thick padded seat is adorable & comfy for her but it has such deep crevices you really have to dig deep to get every crumb cleaned up. The base is very large & her food falls down onto it after every meal so I am not only cleaning the floor but the base as well. The buckles are awkward & impossible to do with one hand. If you have a petite baby ~ this is not the highchair for you.
5,Couldn't Of Asked For Anything Better!,Had a Graco high chair on my registry list and received this instead from Mom because it was pink and she just had to buy pink! Very easy to put together especially at 8 1/2 months pregnant. I love that it reclines and the height is adjustable. It's on wheels which makes it easy to manuever throughout the house and it folds up very easily which makes it easy to store out of the way while not in use. Everything seems to be great about this chair. Our daughter won't be using it for a few months since she isn't even here yet but I'm sure she'll love it as much as I do already.
1,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HIGH CHAIR!!,"I really don't like this high chair at all. My little girl is 10 months old and 19 lbs and she CANNOT sit in this chair without me putting a pillow or towel under her so that she can reach. When sitting on the regular seat, she is so low that she cannot get her arms above the tray to feed herself. This is a huge pain because I have to constantly take out the pillow or towel that she must sit on top of...out to clean. A 10 month old should be able to comfortably sit in a high chair. I have had her in friends high chairs that are a Graco and she fits perfectly. If I could do it over, I would have opted for a less expensive model that she fits in properly. Don't buy this product!!"
2,Readable but lacks drama and context,"Callaghan was in some ways a pivotal political figure. He not only lead the Labour party to a critical defeat which not only saw the conservatives dominate Britain for a record period but his loss of office led to the destruction of everything he stood for. That is the union movement, Britain's place as a manufacturing nation and the notion of the labour party being a working class movement.The writer of the book has been absorbed by Callaghan's career and has come to like him (as did most of the British Electorate). His biography thus lacks a sense of the tragedy of Callaghan's life and the failure of his Prime Minister Ship and the desolation which resulted.Instead we get a picture of a man on the right of the labour movement who was a decent man and tried in his political career to stand for what he thought was right.A readable biography which looks to much at the man and perhaps not enough at the political context."
5,Two thumbs up,"IMHO, No Secrets is the best novel in the Brandon Drake series. I've lived in Japan for about 4 years before moving to USA, and rereading the descriptions in the novel just brings me back. Plus it probably helps that I'm a big fan of mystery novels.Read this book. You won't regret it!"
3,"For collectors only. Old, scratchy, muddy sound.","This is unmistakably the great Ray Charles, and his genius shows through. But these are really old, poor quality recordings, with very muffled and distorted sound. The talent and music are there, but the presentation isn't. And the material jumps all over the place, from syrupy to edgy to occasional rock & roll (like Kiss Me Baby, which cooks.) Maybe I'm not spoiled by more modern recordings. The other six albums and collections I have by Ray sound absolutely clear, bright, tight and consistent. The music on this CD is certainly good, though, and those who just want to hear Ray and don't mind the (very) poor recordings will indeed find the Father of Soul, with his genius on display. That's fine, but I guess I'm more of a listener than a collector, and I find I basically never reach for this CD, since I have many others by Ray that sound so much better."
2,Bad bad...,"These are the beginnings of Ray Charles when he tries to sound like Nat King Cole.The drums are terrible bad! Just listen to ""See See Rider"" and listen how the drums slow down because of his terribly bad entering into the song. The drums sound bad in most of the songs. The band sounds too loud and you can't appreciate the voice or the piano.There are great Ray's recordings out there. Buy another album."
5,A good look at the oil industry in the United States,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Oil Men"". It is a fascinating overview of the oil industry in the United States in the early 1950's as seen through the corporate eyes of the men and women of Shell Oil Company. I may be a little biased in my review since my father was an employee of Shell during this time.I first encountered this book as a youngster and somehow lost it. I was able to aquire it again through Amazon.com . It gives a brief, but comprehensive view of an industry which is often misunderstood, but which has been of great benefit to our nation. I definitely recommend it to any one interested in this field."
4,keepin it alive!,"This is a Japanese horror punk band. They sing in English but they might as well sing in Japanese cuz you cant understand a word this guy says. Aside from that, this record is awesome. Loaded with 80 minutes or so of horror punk in the style of the great Misfits. The only other beaf I had with album other than not understanding the lyrics is that the songs are kinda long but you get used to that after a couple of listens. This is a great album and also comes with a DVD with live videos, music videos and a short horror movie made by the band! Get this record! it is totally worth it."
1,Thanks Jerry Only!!! Thanks a lot!!!,"I don't need ""MISFITS"" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good."
1,Only buy this book if you sent your Autistic child away!!,"I guess this is something that I feel strongly about. Because we have an autistic child who we love, care for, teach and could not imagine living without. It can be extremely exhausting at times but I could never imagine placing our child in another home. I don't want to judge the situation here but I bought this book thinking it was something our other son may relate to. Not so, since Mori does not live with his siblings except for visitation. Our other boy was extremely sad when he heard about Mori not living with his family. I could not recommend this book to anyone who is facing the trials as well as the rewards of living and loving a child with autism each and every day."
4,Birthday Elmo,a fun birthday toy for my grand daughter who is one and loves Elmo. It is a little stiffer than her soft Elmo's but will be a fun addition to her first birthday
3,Felt unfinished,"I am a fan of Malouf's work and I have always found him very insightful. This book was no different, but it finished too quickly for me. I felt there was a section missing that would really help me absorb the themes and message of this novel."
4,What is civilized? What is savage?,"Can one truely define what it means to be civilized and what it means to be savage? David Malouf focuses on questions like these in his novel ""Remembering Babylon"". The main character, Gemmy Fairley, is a British boy, who was washed ashore in the lands of the native inhabitants of Australia and taken in by them. Years later, Gemmy encounters a settlement of British colonizers, where he is taken in by the McIvor family.In the course of the novel, the reader is confronted with the feelings of different settlers concerning Gemmy and the native people of Australia. As he acts the way the natives of Australia do, the settlers cannot decide, whether Gemmy is truely British. In order to contrast their rascist behavior, Malouf gives the reader a background of the settlers. He relates their life stories in a moving manner, showing how the dreams and hopes that the settlers had before coming to Australia, have been shattered."
4,Remembering Babylon,"I read this for a class on British Lit Post-WWII. It's one of those books that I know I wouldn't have picked up off a shelf on my own, but I enjoyed it. Malouf uses a lot of imagery to convey the emotions in both characters and the community as they cope in their own ways with Gemmy. A very interesting story about a white man who is lost overboard a ship as a child, and raised by the aborigines until he comes upon a settlement of whites. Definitely an intriguing look at race (he is known among the settlers as the ""black-white man""), community, and identity."
3,Hans,"The book ""Remembering Babylon"" written by David Malouf takes place in Australia and describes the life from Gemmy who is a man born as a white but grow up in the bush as an Aborigine and then finally lives in a settlement of whites.I think this book is realy interesting because you get a view into a settlement and its problems. And especially the character of Gemmy and his relationship with the settlers are full of suspense because Gemmy and his relationship to the settlers creates a lot of problems.In my opinion the book is partly difficult to understand because there are al lot of switches in the narrative perspective and this is sometimes confusing."
2,"Confusing, even for an Australian!!","Remembering Babylon, I found wasn't aas good as I thought it was going to be. I found at times it was hard to read. I used it as a book to put me to sleep!!!!It is a book I had to do a test about once. Maybe some others will enjoy it. And maybe I am sick of the Australian History!!!"
5,A Definite For The Glassjaw Fan,"Before Glassjaw, there was a band from Long Island, New York called Stillsuit. Manny played bass in this great band. I actually own this CD. I bought it used for 3 bucks at Wherehouse music, and the case was cracked, but the CD was far from being broken. In fact, this is the best CD I have ever purchased. I incinerated my Linkin Park albums last weekend and I never felt better. I love the guitar work on ""Another Bad Movie"" and ""Creepy"", but a song you can't go wrong with is ""Rush Hour"". I will never forget that song! Anyways, you can buy it on Napster and MusicMatch (iTunes doesn't carry TVT records artists), but it is at a lower price on iTunes. You will not regret buying this if you like Quicksand or Orange 9mm."
4,Great for Glassjaw fans,"I baught this cd a few years ago because I heard Daryl Palumbo from Glassjaw say in a video interview that this band was one of the big influences on Glassjaw's sound. This is also there old bass player Manny's old band, and he was the pimp. I think Daryl was in the band for a while too. Its a good album, really raw, it's like a really raw version of Glassjaw's kiss kiss bang bang days. Buy it, there sellin it for 20 cents and its a great addition to any glassjaw collection."
5,Vegetarian by Linda McCartney,"The book is beautiful, the sentimental value is priceless and the glimpse into Linda's world of nutrition and feasting an eye opener into this enigma from an era gone by. The recipes are wonderful though not earth shaking or all that unusual. Still the book is beautiful and the food tastes good. Enjoy."
5,Linda's Kitchen,"Linda McCartney is one of my favourite people, and finding this particular cookbook was tricky - and who would have guessed I would have gotten it used for around 90 cents! Thank you for the great product, that was in fantastic condition for being previously used."
1,The poorest treatment possible of this story.,"I can't help but wondering why Tim Burton decided to turn the funny, illogic, surrealistic, symbolic tale of Alice into the most boring, standard, predictable, a-thousand-times-seen story. It is obvious that he only cares about the visuals, but that results into a boring movie, because the ""plot"" (so to speak) is utterly uninteresting. Lucky I watched it on 3D, as a 2D movie it would be twice as flat. Needless to say I will not purchase it, I couldn't stand this movie more than once, honestly. To me, it is the second great fiasco of Tim Burton's after the equally unbearable ""Planet of the apes""."
1,"240p over FIOS, are you serious? Back to Netflix.","Just tried Amazon's streaming videos for the first time and was shocked to learn it wouldn't let me watch anything but the lowest streaming quality even though I have tested download speeds of 16mbps over fiber optic. Netflix offers streaming movies in HD, so there's simply no comparison. What a horrible way to watch a Burton movie at 240p. I didn't watch the rest of this one and I'm getting a refund as soon as I finish this review.Run as fast as you can from Amazon video rentals!!!"
5,Wonderfully wacky!,I'm biased because I adore Johnny Depp but this is a good DVD to have on hand. Johnny Depp's character is so goofy and yet well developed. The cinematography is detailed and fun. Helina Bonham Carter is fantastic as the Red Queen. Alice's actress grows on you by the end of the movie.
4,Good!,"I bought this movie as a present, and it was a great price. It works great and I highly recommend it"
2,Too Weird,"This is just too weird for words.... I didn't care for it. More wasted money. I hate movie theaters, but wish I had rented this one from the library."
3,Drug-induced Wonderland.,"Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton is a colorful but somewhat chaotic tale. It would be nice if I could understand what the heck Johnny Depp was saying in this film? He mumbles every line, seriously! His physical comedy is what makes him a fan favorite but when he speaks, I can't stand to hear him. The real scene stealer of this film is newcomer, Mia Wasikowska who plays Alice - she brings a quiet but stubborn quality to the role and I just loved Anne Hathaway as the White Queen, she's a funny little thing! Alice in Wonderland is good but poorly developed, 3 stars for me."
3,Through The Looking Glass,"I think the film had more elements from ""Through The Looking Glass"" than from ""Alice In Wonderland"". Maybe the producers thought today's audience wouldn't recognize the title ""Through The Looking Glass"" as readily as it would the title ""Alice In Wonderland"". Or maybe today's audience wouldn't know what a ""looking glass"" is."
4,"Tim Burton's ""Wonderland"" Adventure","After the missed opportunity of Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature (not to mention Paramount's 1933 live-action curio), director Tim Burton takes Lewis Carroll on a cinematic roller-coaster ride. The 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" has an enchanting spark that somehow eluded Disney nearly 60 years earlier. Mia Wasikowska's inspired performance as a refreshingly mature Alice is well-matched by Helena Bonham Carter's wicked Red Queen and Johnny Depp's twisted Mad Hatter. A tad slow at times, but endlessly imaginative in the Burton tradition. In fact, the new version would make a terrific double-bill with ""Beetlejuice."""
1,"Movie is marked ""not for sale promotional item only""","I purchased this as a gift and felt misled when the description didnt tell me the case has big writing ""not for sale promotional item only"" The seller was notified about this misleading description yet fails to do anything. For five extra bux you can get the real movie that comes with the blu ray, dvd, etc. I do love amazon though, they issued a refund and as always, provided excellent customer service."
2,Very disappointing...,"I waited a long time to see this film and besides the good CG, the movie was just boring.The story was bad and there was very slow character development. I yawned four times and i watched it in 3D, That's how bad it was.."
2,ok really a 2.5,"To start I do not have a love affair with Burton/Depp movies. They have some good, they have some awful, and then there is Wonderland. To me it showcases some what quality actors can do with a bad script, and bad movie. The over the top colors, and cinematography were an attempt to cover up a poor story. I really look at this movie as a 2.5 out of 5. Bad movie, bad story, bad cinematography, but very well done acting, and deliverance of lines.In the end if you are like mnay who simply fall in love with ever Burton/Depp movie, then I am sure you will rate this movie higher and not share my feelings. However, to each their own and for anyone thinking about buying before viewing it once, I would not recomend that path."
2,audio leaves much to be desired,"Even with the volume on the TV and speakers at their highest, it was impossible to hear the audio for this film."
4,Brilliant!!,"Tim Burton's telling of this marvelous tale, which would have been more fittingly titled ""Return To Wonderland"" is truly a visual masterpiece! The combinations of live action and computer animation were brilliantly executed to create this Burtonesque rendition of Wonderland. Quite a wonderfully strange film that I will definitely visit again."
5,"Good Movie, GREAT in 3D!!!!","Growing up, I could NEVER watch any Alice in Wonderland movie b/c that vanishing cat just creeped me out... so, I decided to give it a try again now that I am an adult....and what can I say, I really enjoyed the movie. I first this in 2D and was very impressed by the acting, the imagery, and who can not like Johnny Depp!!! He seems to have a knack for playing the weirdest characters....BUT, the 3D version of this movie just ROCKS!!! it is like this mvie was MADE to be watched in 3D.... it is nothing short of spectacular!!! the images are crisp and FULL of color!!I've never read the book so I can't say if it stays true to story, all I can comment on is what I've seen and THAT impressed me....If you have a 3D TV, I would defn recommend adding this movie to your collection! It is defn worth it! I know I will be viewing it again!"
3,Through the Looking glass!,"I haven't seen the movie but from previews and what other people are saying here about the story being different, it isn't. The Jabberwocky and other parts I saw are from the sequel Through the Looking Glass. Alice returns when she is older, through a mirror this time.Note of interest!! Hatters , people who made hats, once used chemical ingredients like mercury nitrate to soften the felt. It caused tremors and other nervous symptoms."
1,Pulling nails,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen, everything seemed to move along really slow and not a lot going on. Picture quality was great, however the audio quality left a lot to be desired. I could not wait for the movie to end and I am a Johnny fan too. I won't be watching this movie ever again.This was watched on a Samsung 8000 in blu-ray."
3,"good movie, okay 3D","3D effect was bad at times, probably because of all the fast action. 3D looks best during still and slow scenes. The movie was okay, not worth the money really."
2,Not 3D all the time...,"Not so great 3D, I have seen better, like Polar Express, was great. Also this movie is not for young children, it's scary all the way through. The 3D switches back and fort between 2D and 3D. I even took my glasses of to check and at times it was in 2D. I am disappointed with this movie coming from Disney."
3,Genius Unfolds Underland.,"There is a problem with this review: I've never been an Alice enthusiast nor have I read the original books. So read on if that doesn't matter.Tim Burton is most courageous as a film visionary - his films break new attitudes and visual ground. Storytelling-wise, however, his films have memorable scenes chained together with a dental-floss-storyline and medium-to-slow pacing - but more power to him; he's doing what he loves in a market very closed to originality. Burton refreshingly breaks his storytelling pattern for 'Alice' with slightly quicker pacing, and still offers the ground-breaking visuals you ache for. The mixture of virtual and real - sometimes within the same character - is nearly seamless. Alice is played with a quiet sensitivity by Wasikowska, and it's through your strong sympathy with her character that you come to experience and love the characters and of 'Underland'.We are privileged to see the talent of Burton unfold as mainstream genius."
5,Awesome movie!,"First off, I love Johnny Depp, so he completely made the movie! Secondly, I love Tim Burton and this is totally a Tim Burton movie. The colors are amazing, the acting is great, and the costumes are perfect!"
3,Alice in Wonderland,"The film was very unusual, but so was the original. I was somewhat dissapointed in Johnny Depp. They did not maximize his role with the great lines he usually has.It was entertaining, but would not care to watch again."
4,DELIGHTFUL !,"This was DELIGHTFUL! I have not been a big fan of the story Alice in Wonderland growing up (I'm 40+) - - but I have to say I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE. Perhaps part of that is because this is really a SEQUEL to that original story.It's colorful, amusing and very entertaining (the imagination that went into making the characters come to life, the sets and all the people who pulled it off were top notch!)Mia Wasikowska was perfect as Alice!I will be buying this."
5,A New Classic,"This is destined to be a classic of the caliber of The Princess Bride or Benny and Joon. Tweedledum & Tweedledee, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare are perfectly done. Great fun!"
4,"Characters were great, movie was alright.","Ok so basicially i only wanted 2 see this movie is because of (da da da!) Johnny Depp. 4 those of u that have seen my other reviews, this isn't a big shocker. and johnny really was a great actor as always. but i feel in love with the other characters as well. the white queen,red,chesire,mally,mctwist,alice, but the movie itself was... short. the battle wasn't so awesome as i thought it would be. and the movie sort of rambled on and on (my sister kept on turning to me in the movies and kept saying ""wat did the clown say""?)not that i didn't like the movie, just tim burton could've done better. and i hope he's gonna make a sequl, or else its off with his head! (cheesy, but probobly the best line in the movie)"
5,GENIOUS - PURE GENIUS! - BONHAM CARTER!!!!!!!!,"This IS HELENA BONHAM CARTER's show! She gives us a total 3 dimensional Queen - with the ""haps"" and ""sads"" and ""funnies"" with just a little touch of Better Davis? Perhaps the rings, the wig, something very next.DEPP is great as the Hatter - but the accents confuse - sometimes Scots, sometimes North Country.I loved the small touches on Hatter - bloodied finger - too many sewing needles - the thimballs .....COLLEEN ATWOOD's realization of the costumes are always picture perfect - down to the fabric ....... important doing period work.HATHAWAY, MIA W., GLOVER, the rest of the ensemble fit perfectly - this is what Carol intended us to see ...... including the dark sides ....... the moat with the heads.Tiny touch of ""OZ"" - but Alice came before ""OZ"" - so maybe its the reverse.THIS MUST be seen in IMAX - you have to be IN the picture.Fave? CHESHIRE CAT natch.Great music by Elfman - touches of Glass ... but that's to be overlooked."
4,More than I needed or wanted,"When I shopped for this movie, all I wanted was the movie in 3-D, not the other 3 disc's. I have no use for them and it just cost me to much to get the one I wanted. At the time I could not see any other way to get it. Not very fair to force me to buy that way just to get the one I wanted."
1,Don't bother,"Horrific CGI mixed with a drab storyline/story and sub-par acting on almost all fronts made this movie nearly unwatchable, considering the foundation it stemmed from. Granted the art direction was nice and I enjoyed the Church Mouse and the March Hare, though not enough to ever bother watching it again. That being said, if you're looking for this on Amazon, you've likely already seen the film and liked it, otherwise you would just rent it. But if you haven't... please, don't bother. Go get Burtons' Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish instead, something with heart and genuine storytelling."
1,What more can be told about Alice in Wonderland?,"This was a big dissapointment. I am (believe it or not) a fan of the Alice in Wonderland story, which is the reason why I do not like this 3-D version of ""Alice in Wonderland""This film is set many years after the first/original version. Alice is about to get married, when once again, she spots the white rabbit, and follows him. Once back in Wonderland Alice embarks on her true destiny: end the red queen's reign of power.Overall, I thought this film really did not have a great plot, it was just same old, same old. Its like Tim Burton was more focused on the special effects then the story-line."
4,Beautiful,"At first I thought this was the typical post-modern feminist redux for a classic, and so settled in to simply enjoy the design. And I wasn't dissapointed. It's a feast for the eyes."
5,Good Movie and Fast Delivery,"I pre-ordered this in the 3-disc Edition and it was in my hand barely a day after the release date. It was in perfect condition without cracks or smudges (I was worried it might be damaged in transit). As for the movie itself, I love Burton films and this is a gem! Good value."
2,New Alice in Wonderland-WARNING,There was a lack of continuity and it kept repeating itself to the point of boredom.Lousy movie!WARNING: Bought it for my 6yr old grandaughter and it would have scared the daylights out of her.Defintely not what I expected. Glad I watched it before sending it to her.Bill Gunnell
3,Burton misses the mark here...,"One reviewer described ""visual overload."" To that should be added, ""CGI without a story."" Unlike most other Tim Burton films, even the Elfman score comes up short. Sure, the CGI is over the top and the film will probably scare the daylights out of the young fry. But that said, you get the feeling he's missed the mark. Watch the 50s Disney version instead!"
2,fell asleep,This movie made gangbuster in the box office so I had to see this movie. I was bored and fell asleep. Didn't see why it did so well?
3,Oh Johny Say It So,"Bright colors, johnny depp, helena boham carter all point to tim burton movie. It had all the potential to be a great version of this wonderful movie, but instead it becomes very tiring. It is just a collection of Burton's past accomplishments wrapped up in the dressing of a classic. It just has many of the same old tired tricks that go no where quick. He could have innovated somewhere, as the book provides ample opportunity, but it never comes. Worth a redbox rental, but not worth buying."
5,Christmas gift,Made an excellent choice for a co-worker! We have many laughs comparing our daily lives to the infamous rabbit hole :)
5,Alice Wonderland,"i liked because theirs version is enjoy it to watch them,theirs tranfer is totally clean and clear and i love when gets spanish version specially 5.1,thanks"
2,Not impressive in any way.,"There are very few reviews of this so I thought I'd add my two cents worth. I received this movie in the Sony 3d starter kit with my Sony 3d television. Maybe I expect too much but I wasn't very impressed with the 3d quality of this movie. 3d quality, in general, seems to vary quite a bit with content. I've played some 3d video games that cause you to jump because you feel like you're about to be hit with something (with no ghosting), and then this. It's my belief that since this movie wasn't created in native 3d(like Avatar), the 3d was an afterthought. Furthermore, there was signifigant ghosting at times and the 3d effect consistently broke down. To add to all of this, though I'm a Tim Burton fan (Sleepy Hollow, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure et cetera), the movie itself really has a ""been there, done that"" feel to it."
2,....The Brits Don't Like It..!,"....I side with them.Read Amazon U.K Reviews.It's their story..Disney's 1950 Animated tale is much better..!..And Too Much Depp Is TOO MUCH..!..Stay In France, Johnny Boy..!"
4,Great Movie but....,This is a great movie actually - just wish I had gone for the DVD with the all the extras. Worth the price without doubt.
4,"Pretty good movie, don't judge it by the first half","I have to admit watching the first half was quite boring. But after the plot started to unfold and everything else, it was a good movie. I almost quit watching it because I felt it had way too much gore in it to be a kid's movie. With the dragon's head being cut off, the snowdog's eye being plucked out, and the girl's arm being scratched it was almost too much. But after all that nonsense, it was a great movie. The ending was very good. What looked like a rather boring and uneventful movie, turned out to be quite good at the end earning it 4 stars."
4,Great movie...,I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was fun and entertaining. It was colorful and creative. The acting was great and I thought it was a wonderful remake of the original. My son aged 7 and my daughter aged 9 were both entertained. My husband who has never seen Alice in Wonderland before (crazy huh?) was a bit lost but still enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie for both young and old.
5,Storybook pages come to life,I love the use of color in this movie. It is as if an antique storybook has come to life. I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors of our generation. I also like the fact that he likes to explore different views with director Tim Burton
5,Alice In Wonderland,"This movie is adorable! What will we ever do without Johnny Depp? He is brilliant in this movie and I didn't think he could get more brilliant than Jack Sparrow in ""Pirates of the Caribbean""> Superb movie for all ages!"
4,Great effects,"I like Tim Burton and I liked this movie. Johnny Dep is always great but if you are looking for the traditional ""Alice"" story you will find this confusing...creative but confusing."
3,Alice in Wonderland,"Good Movie,But my opinion it is not suitable for young Children.I would prefer to show young children the original version."
4,Great 3d,This movie is great with the new 3d tvs and active glasses. Would recommend. Images are good. Same movie - but with great 3d images.
3,Listen to Alice,"Well done 3D, good video special effects.Would be a 5 star except for the audio (or lack of). There is no secondary video/audio output on the 3D Blu-ray disk (normally used with analog TVs and such). Spent nearly a hour trying to figure out what was wrong with my player (this is the only 3D disk that I have that does this so far). Granted a 3D low resolution video is useless, but how about us audio buffs?So unless you have a newer home theater system that taps off audio from the player's HDMI output, you are out of luck if you want to attach a legacy Dolby audio system."
5,Burton/Depp/Carroll - What else is there to say?,A great take on the Lewis Carroll classic. Entering Burton's Wonderland is a trip you won't soon forget. Love it!
5,REVIEW,Nice story plot. Good collection of blu ray movies! You can appreciate the nice graphics using this blu ray cd. Worth the money!
1,never received,"Still waiting for my product ,I never have had this problem with any other company and will never choose lola teacher ever again!"
1,"Borring & pointless, save your money!","It's no wonder the studios decided to convert this ""movie"" into 3D - with no plot, weak acting, and pitiful directing, if it had been released in 2D, audiences might have noticed how crappy this thing is instead of being distracted by colorful 3D images. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
2,Off with Alice's head,I wish this film would have been more pyscadelic and trippy and less violent and boring. I think they should have left out the battle sequence with the jaborwocky. It reminded me too much of Lord of the Rings. The only character I found interesting was Helena Bonham's character as the red queen. Anne Hathaway totally overacted as the white queen and Johnny Depp was annoying as usual. How could you mess up Alice in Wonderland? It's not rocket science people.
5,Its a Wonderland,"I don't know what it is about the Alice in Wonderland movies? To be wisked off to a place where anything is possible? Yea I think that about covers it, I currently own three different versions of this movie and could not wait to add this one to my collection. . . . . Beware of the jabberwocki!!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"Love love love, absolutely LOVE this movie! It's a great family movie that sparks your imagination. I got my creativity groove back after watching this movie."
4,Alice in Wonderland but --,"HEY DUDE,JUST WANTED TO COMPLIMENT YOU ON HOW YOU ENDED YOUR REVIEW ""WONDERLAND IS WAITING FOR YOU"", THAT WAS BRILLIANT! LOL. I RMEEMBER SEEING THE PREVIEWS TO THE MOVIE AND HAVE SEEN THE ORIGINAL BUT DON'T REMEMBER MUCH OF IT SINCE I WAS ABOUT 5 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME BUT I THOUGHT SEEING AND UPDATE VERSION FROM WHAT I SAW THROUGH THE COMMERICIALS HAD MY CURIOUSITY GOING AND MY RESPOND TO MY HUSBAND WAS, ""WE'VE GOTTA SEE THIS"" JOHNNY DEPP IS ALSO A RIOT AND ANN HATHAWAY? I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS. I KNOW IT'LL BE WELL WORTH SEEING. I LIKE TO CRITIQUE THE DIFFERENCE IN UPDATED MOVIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR REVIEW, IT MAKES ME WANT TO SEE THE MOVIE EVEN MORE.SO HERE I GO INTO WONDERLAND WUHOOO!"
1,traffic lights are more entertaining,"Johnny Depp and Tim Burton teaming on a childhood favorite... sounds promising. Not so much. I thought it was a snore fest in bright colors. After about an hour I actually stopped the movie and sent it back to netflix thanful that I hadn't paid to see this in a theatre. The only good thing about this movie is the song ""Her name is Alice"" by Shinedown. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else to see or waste their time with."
1,boring,I found this to be awfully boring even with Johnnie Depp. I liked the Walt Disney cartoon version to be much more enjoyable. The version I watched had no sub-titles. The movie as a whole was was dark and hard to make out most of the time. I don't see how a young child would watch this w/out falling asleep.
1,Alice Down The Rabbit Hole,"This film was a complete disappointment. Tim Burton is losing his place as imaginative and unique. Alice should be a sweet, young girl who falls under the spell of a dream. She is not the maniac as portrayed in this film. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum are now Dweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber. The catepillar smokes too much and the rabbit has no idea where he is going. The Mad Hatter is completely lost along with the Red Queen. Please take this film and throw it as far as it will go into the blackness that is called Burton-Town."
2,Awful!,"No matter how I tried, I could NOT like this movie. It was too weird! Sorry but I prefer ORIGINAL movies! Why can't Hollywood have a creative idea of their own instead of ruining other movies by remaking them? Total waste of time!"
5,Alice in Wonderland,"This film is a marvel of a mix of technology and live acting. Some of the characters, for instance the Bandersnach, are totally computer generated characters. The actors worked in green screen for much of the film Their bodies were electonically wired to grasp their movements then their costumes and real faces were added later. I love the alice in wonderland story. I've read the original. I've read the annotated Alice where Twas Brillig is translated into understandable English. A wonderful story and a wonderful movie. Johnny Depp is great as the mad hatter. The casting was excellent as was the costuming. I kept checking it out of the library until I finally decided to buy my copy from Amazon."
3,It's good if you like Tim Burton movies,"I watched this DVD & I was disappointed somewhat in the voices of the red queen & her consort. I couldn't understand what they were saying. I have high praise, however, for the protaganists, Johnny Depp & the leading lady. It's really a movie for adults, not children unless they are miniature adults. The Tim Birton effect, is as usual, dark & occasionally humorous. He is truly imaginative. The makeup & background & the characters are wonderfully ""Burtonish""."
4,NOT THE ALICE YOU MIGHT RECALL,"You'd think by all the negative reviews that everyone expected Tim Burton, of all creative people, to follow the book ( ALICE IN WONDERLAND ) in reverential lockstep. It is pretty apparent from the opening scenes that this will not be the case ( and, personally speaking, I would have been disappointed had he chosen to do so ). I do agree that the plot was a bit plodding at times, and on more than a few occasions it seemed as though both the cast and crew had wandered into LSD-land, but there was some good dialogue, and fun takes on classic characters ( Alan Rickman's Caterpillar, Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen, and especially Stephen Fry's wonderful Cheshire Cat ), and despite some false steps, the casting of Mia Wasikowska as a grown up version of Carroll's heroine was inspired.It isn't Burton's, or Depp's finest work, but it is quite watchable, and I did not find the CGI to be anywhere near as reprehensible as some seemed to believe it was."
5,Love it,Really can you not like something Johnny does. It is great nothing like the original. This is a fun movie not really for young children.
2,Nearly two hours of Fudderwacken,"Tim Burton really needs a high-profile failure or two to bring him back to earth and get him to engage strong again; sadly, this movie didn't do that. It's an interesting-looking mess, but it's completely a mess, even by the standards of an Alice movie."
2,"1/3 Alice, 2/3 Harry Potter","Alice in Wonderland is the tale of a little girl lost in a land of nonsense. A land of NONSENSE!This movie has hardly any nonsense at all. It feels more like a Harry Potter movie than Alice in Wonderland. I wanted Alice. Alice get's trapped in a surreal dream-like Wonderland where everything is nonsense and there is tons of wordplay, puns, ect.And the nerve to name the movie Alice in Wonderland. It's not that story. They should've named it Return to Wonderland: The Battle to Make a Harry Potter movie with Alice Characters."
2,Unfortunate,"I was waiting for the actual story; as it is in the book. Where WAS Tim Burton in this? This Movie COULD have been as profound as the book. What patients I did have for it left me with . . . Disney. wow. I found it difficult to remain interested. Nice camera work; effects. I would have preferred a story line that was good, and original."
2,crappy 3d,"Wasn't impressed at all with the 3d. At times the convergence is way off. Things in the foreground will have ghosting (this can be seen when paused so it's no the speed of the TV) while things in the center of the screen will be perfectly aligned. While at times there is good depth in the image it seemed like the 3D was hit or miss and depending on the scene you either had an excellent image or a crappy one.Everything else I've seen in 3d at home has been excellent (AVATAR, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Resident Evil)."
3,I was expecting something a little different..,"First, I'd like to say, I'm a huge Tim Burton/Depp fan. When I picked this title up, I thought it was going to be a retelling of the original store but instead its more ""a return too"" wonderland. The story was ok. I kept this title for some time just to show off the quality of Blu ray and my plasma TV. Looks great also has great sound. Technically very impressive."
2,Ugggh!,"I have always enjoyed Johnny Depp movies, and think they are fun. Alice in Wonderland is a poorly written film, and although Johnny was his usual wonderful self, this film was a waste of my time and bucks."
1,Big Disappointment,"When i first heard that tim burton was directing allice and wonderland i thought. i thought wow after seeing what he did in Batman Returns that Alice in Wonderland was going to spill over with surreal visuals, beautiful scenes and weird characters,all spawned from burton's wildly creative imagination. But instead it was boring, a movie that seemed drab even for Burton, every scene seemed like it was covered in dirt. and I could not picture any child sitting through this without losing intrest in the first 15 minutes Big Disappointment from one of my favorite directors. definatly a waste of talent and money. My guess is burton did'nt get the budget he wanted from Disney and fudged this one. it should be swept under the rug and forgotten. dont even waste your money buying it on Blu Rayunlike Avatar there nothing to see here."
3,Expected more from Burton and Depp,"Not being a remake was a surprize, but little else was. The preview clips were the best parts of the film. It started, ran and ended rather dully. Over a minimal sound system, or TV, the voices were muffled in the sound track. It was very lack luster for a Depp movie."
2,"Good, but not as good as expected","I had high expectations. The movie was good, but not nearly as good as I was expecting. The animations were a mixed bag. Some of the characters turned out really well and others not so much.Only two stars because of the Blu-ray transfer. Disappointment for sure.Upset that the aspect is 1.78:1 and the original was 1.85.1. This blows for those of us with CIH setups. Our blu-ray from netflix had DTS-HD Master Audio at 5.1, not 6.1.I purchase really good blu-rays, but not this one. Just lacks in video and sound features."
3,Good,"I like Burton's films, and can go a long way to stretch with him on his abstract take on things. While I liked the spin the cast put on their roles and the modern visuals of the characters, an overall cohesion was lacking in the direction that left me wanting more. Wrapping the classic story in a modern metaphor of innocence lost and adult perspective on childhood was an original take. The film's a good one to watch if you're a Burton or Depp fan, or if you enjoy dark fantasy, but likely not for fans of the storybook variety of Alice."
3,too much CGI for it`s own good,"This movie is too long and all that CGI interferes with the story line. Also very dark. Thank god for all the really great film noir classics that didn`t rely on CGI or high definiton. Remember when food tasted good without all the preservatives, music wasn`t overworked by computers and big brother wasn`t watching you at traffic lights? Brave New World is here, but just a little later than Huxley predicted."
4,oh yeah,"tottaly excited about this one it's a great product and not to mention its my favorite disny movie ,hello its j-dub ! I'm also sasitfied on how fast it came like in 4 days awsome i would buy from this seller again!"
4,A delightfully absurd adventure,"Tim Burton was a natural pick to direct something like Alice in Wonderland. The movie doesn't really follow the plot of the books or the animated Disney film, but it has plenty of nods to them, and a fun story."
5,Love it!!!,"I hated this movie when I saw it on DVD, but the 3D is some of the best work out there and just really gets you into the movie. A must have!!!"
3,Visually stunning; very little story,"As others have noted, there was a huge pile of money spent on effects and visuals here, as well as on costumes.At least there is a good cast.The main problem is that it all seems so familiar. I thought the Tweedles had arrived straight from Nightmare Before Christmas, the twisted tree might have been left over from Sleepy Hollow, and the music sounds like most of the music of Burton's other films. And of course, there is Johnny Depp, and Helena Bonham Carter. Again.And what was with the blending of the poem ""jabberwocky"" with the story of Alice? That just didn't work at all for me."
2,"""ALICE IN TIM BURTONLAND""- 2010","Director Tim Burton doesn't really bother to adapt ""Alice In Wonderland"" (he and screenwriter Linda Woolverton throw Lewis Carroll's original ""Alice"" books completely away) as much as he creates ""Alice In Tim Burtonland."" As such, the film does not disappoint. . At worst, Lewis Carroll's enigmatic Wonderland is transformed into a standard ""fantasy cinema"" (extremely CGI) landscape where a standard battle between Good and Evil must be fought and won. At best, Tim Burton gives you a typical ""Tim Burton film"" with his trademark touches; such as his creative muse Johnny Depp as a deathly pale, demented, Bozo the Clown-looking Mad Hatter; and his wife Helena Bonham Carter perfectly cast as the tyrannical Red Queen. Anne Hathaway is spacey, saintly and ""blissed out"" as the White Queen. As an almost adult Alice, Mia Wasikowski looks bored and baffled throughout."
2,one of Burton's WORST films.,"A totally joyless experience. I shut it off after an hour. The one saving grace is Helena Bonham carter. The rest of the film is truly a misguided mess, with an interesting cgi look but a horrible script. It's one of director Tim Burton's worst films (an honor I gave previously to 'Planet of the Apes"". Yes, its THAT bad."
3,"No ""out of screen"" 3d effects","No in the room 3d effects. Good depth of field, as you would expect from any 3d movie. Story just as expected."
4,3D movie,Very pleased on the price I got for this 4 Disc combo. Enjoyed watching it in 3D also. Grandchildren love it too.
3,Alice in Wonderland movie,In my opinion this movie is not for children. It's too scary. I would rather children watch an earlier version. I'm a fan of Johnny Depp and it shows his versitality as an actor but not my favorite role for him. I loved him in the Pirate movies and other movies but not this one. Think twice before getting this one.
3,INCOMPLETE,"Even I give the movie an A. The Blue Ray fell short of expectation. Even though you get more special features then the DVD 2 disk it does not very much. They might have done special on the main actors but nothing on the dragon, the caterpillar, the white rabbit and many more they could have done. And there is no director commentary. They are probably going to put on a future Blue Ray to make more money."
1,Fell asleep,When in God's name is Johnny Depp going to star in a GOOD movie? He's being wasted on these Tim Burton films. I didn't enjoy this movie at all.
3,A kids Review,"Alice went to sleep and got woken up by the rabbit. She falls in to the deep hole. When she gets too big and can't get out she starts to cry and makes a pool of tears. She turn back small and falls in her own pool tears. She goes out and meets all the people later. Alice goes to the rabbit house and drinks the drink me bottle and gets bigger. This story has a lot of wired creators like the mad hatter, rabbit, caterpillar and the queen of hearts. Alice had a great adventure in this world called Wonderland. I hope you read and enjoy the crazy things in this crazy book.Stephanie"
2,I can't believe Alice succeeded,"everyone knows that the Jabberwocki should have rightly made a meal of Alice and given control of Underland back to the Red Queen, she's a real looker you know.I would have loved to be cast as the King to her Queen since she wouldn't have had to off me like she did to the King of Hearts."
3,"The First Halfway Decent ""Alice"" Film","The reason I like this film is that I love Lewis Carroll & just about every version of ""Alice"" ever made (with the exception of the Disney and one or two others) are crushing bores - annoying pieces of crap that are basically unwatchable.This version works as a film: it looks amazing, it has a storyline, and it was helmed by a gifted director. It is entertaining & contains several really good performances - notably Johnny Depp & Anne Hathaway.Is it perfect? No. Is it lacking in areas? Yes. Is it probably the best film based on the ""Alice"" books yet made? - I'd say ""Yes""."
3,Rent it...,"I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, and like most people, am a fan of Alice in Wonderland, so I didn't think twice about buying this movie. Being available in Blu-Ray was an added bonus.I wish I could return this movie and get the 20 bucks back. It just didn't ""do it"" for me, with the storyline being ""corny"" (I know, the original is corny, too, but I'm talking CORNY) and the actors were just ""odd""...I didn't realize it was a Tim Burton production--that would have alerted me to the crash-and-burn movie it turned out to be. (I am not a Burton fan...) This movie is just like all of his other movies, so if you are a fan, you might be more inclined to like it than I.As far as the special effects, they are impressive, and the Blu Ray does make them stand out better than a regular DVD.I guess I just wish I'd rented it instead of spending so much on it, knowing that I won't be watching it again. Grrr..."
3,"Good movie, poor DVD","I enjoyed this movie, although towards the end of the DVD, the volume does drop, then return to normal. It does this in three places. I'd give it four stars, except for that."
4,Back to Wonderland,Johnny Depp gave one of his best acting performance as the Mad Hatter. He brought life to a deep charactor. Well done Mr Depp. This movie was enchanting. The special effects were well done. Alice played by Mia Wasikowski now 19 years returns to the magical world of Wonderland. By returning to wonderland she meets some of old and new charactors. This is must see for Johnny Depp fans.
5,"Sweetest, little dish","This is the sweetest, little dish. It was the perfect addition to a baptism gift for my dear friend's baby. It's also perfectly sized for stowing your everyday jewelry at the end of the day on your dresser or bedside table. I'm going to pick one up for myself too."
1,Reason for purchase,This book was purchased as a gift to my daughter who is getting married next fall. I felt it might be a good idea for her to study this before making some of the mistakes I have made in my marriage. I would have welcomed this type of study befor my marriage 40 years ago
1,please do not take this book to heart!,I used this book to try to save my marriage years ago.I just read an article about gaslighting...My ex was the MASTER of the gaslight..he made me think i was crazy.Before you take this book to heart please get outside advice from a therapist.This book caused me to allow many extra years of damage to my life and well being. Even gave me reasons to be cruel to myself after my marriage did dissolve.I read this book in the early eighties. Today(2012) I read the article on gaslighting...a manipulative behavior named after an Ingred Bergman movie. I was journaling and thought about this book and thought OMG I hope this thing is not still in print. But it is!Not saying it is all bad...just get another opinion before you blame yourself for your bad marriage. Sometimes it is not the wife's fault. And you are not crazy.BEWARE
1,You can be the wife of a happy husband,"Unless you are a bible thumper, do not buy this book! I believe in God but this book is completely off base. Masturbation is a sin, working outside of the home is wrong, commit yourself to Christ and he will provide etc etc. This book is so out of date its almost comical. For the 50's houswife, not today in 2004."
2,CD NOT AS DESCRIBED!!!,"I received this CD in December of 2003. Five songs listed in the song samples were NOT on this CD: 1. Cool Yule, 2. White Christmas, 5. Winter Wonderland, 6. Christmas Night in Harlem, 9. Joseph 'N His Brudders. Very disappointing. Three songs that were on the CD, but not listed in the song samples were: Hello Dolly, Blue Moon, A Kiss to Build a Dream On. None of which are Christmas songs!? This CD contains 10 Songs, not 12!!!"
3,Not as advertised,This did not come with the songs listed. Hello Dolly and other songs were added and some songs removed. Is the same as the disc that comes with Christmas in New Orleans.
3,Poor Audio Quality,"Great songs but if you've got high end audio equipment, you won't be pleased with the quality of this recording."
5,A highly original Christmas album,"This is really a great CD, and probably one of very few actually palatable jazz Christmas albums. The key to Louis Armstrong's success where many others have failed dismally (besides the fact that he is a genius and probably the key musical influence of the 20th century) is he didn't try to adapt traditional Christmas standards to jazz, instead performing original jazz Christmas compositions. ""Cool Yule"" is definitely the standout track on this album. Not to be missed is a recording of Louis Armstrong reading ""The Night Before Christmas"" to kids during what sounds like a live radio broadcast. His New Orleans growl is wonderfully unlike any reading of the poem that I've heard! A final highlight is live recording of ""What a Wonderful World"", capturing a vitality I've often found lacking on the original recording."
1,Big Disappointment,Only a couple Christmas songs. Which are good but the rest you can tell the company threw in as fillers that have nothing to do with Christmas.
4,Listen to Louis Armstrong for Quality?,"With the variations of Louis's songs, this album really brings out his creative side. Many people have complained about SOUND QUALITY. Well of course they had $50,000 studio sound equipment with Hi-Tech audio enhancer gadgets back in the day. The point is: People don't listen to Louis Armstrong for the quality of the recording, they listen to him for his style and great personality. In my opinion, this grindy crackling sound emits an aura of oldness and warmth; one feels like he's living back in the 40's where great music can be heard from every street corner and masterpieces didn't cost $15. So if you HAVE to have good sound quality, why, go pick yourself up a nice Brian Sezter Muzac while you're at it."
3,Cool but very difficult and MESSY!,My daughter still has it in her closet from last Christmas unused. Too messy and hard to use....she is 10.
2,DIdn't Expect It,"I thought this CD was going to be great because of Louis Armstrong. However, it didn't really feel New Orleansy."
2,Ugh.,"Bought this at a local market, on sale thankfully, and am fully disappointed. It's bitter and doesn't have great olive flavor, though it is quite a beautiful green color. If you're looking for a mid-premium olive oil I'd recommend Alessi or Lucini way over this product and both are in the same price range."
2,oops another generic hc album,"If you have made it this far you have wasted enough time, just run head first into a brick wall for more fun. Reckon it to your uncles band wanting to play at your party."
4,A Roast Dinner of a Book,"If stories were meals, this would be a roast dinner with steamed treacle pudding for afters! ""The Colour"" is a filling read.Tremain has delivered a story with a stunning landscape - New Zealand in the gold rush - a strong, believable female main character, and a story arc that keeps you reading to the bitter, sad, yet liberating end.Someone told me that a good book teaches you something concrete about life you didn't know when you read the spine. Tremain has taught me about the sharpness of grass, the fickle quality of gold and how to keep a cow warm.Priceless.Bunny"
2,Not My Favorite,"This book was chosen by my reading group committee not myself. It is a book full of great hardship, death, and disappointment for almost all of the characters. I wouldn't recommend it for readers who like Jane Austen."
4,"Very engaging, thought provoking","I have to say that I was surpised how much I liked this book. It kept me hooked and I couldn't wait to find out how it all turned out. I think it's a relevant narrative on the role ""stuff"" (i.e. material possesions) has in our lives. It's got great characters and is a really interesting story.(Sorry, I'm not going to deliver a page-long essay - you'll have to read it yourself!)"
5,Great book,"Octavia is a great writer. This book, along with Parable of the Sower will grab you. Awesome character development, and an unfortunately, believable plot."
4,An Inspiring Parable,"Octavia Butler has written a stimulating,thought provoking tale of 21st century America dominated by lawlessness, slavery and religious fanatacism. Education, family and even more importantly -community, become essential for survival. Although this futuristic picture is often dark and depressing,Lauren Olamina's Earthseed community's diversity and it's vision for the future provide a positive note. In this ""parable"",Lauren makes the ultimate sacrifice of her own family to use her talents for the greater good of the community. How inspiring to read of a Black woman portrayed with such strength and fortitude!"
5,Butler provides a scary yet believable look at the future.,The future as presented by Octavia Butler in The Parable of the Talents is harrowing yet absolutely believable. Ms. Butler continues to provide superb chacterizations and weaves an exciting and fast paced story that is difficult to put down. The novel appeals on several levels - a look at religion and religious persecution; a look at oppression from the eyes of the oppressed and their struggles to overcome. The technological advances presented are very believable and fit in with current trends. The political and social climate she depicts are so real that it's scary. It's eerily reminiscent of Germany in 1939. I am hungry for more from Octavia Butler and eagerly await her next literary offering.
5,Engrossing and Thought Provoking,"This story is for everyone. Ms. Butler writes like a true prophet. If you like the more social/cultural episodes of The Next Generation, you love any of Ms. Butler's stories. You may even begin to believe she's ghost-written a few of them."
2,Very bleak,"I would be the first to say that Octavia Butler is an excellent writer. However, I found this particular tale too depressing. My problems actually did not lie with the violence of the book. I was extremely bothered by an impression that every single character in this story was a victim (and that includes the villans). Even the ending did not seem any more hopeful. What is the point?"
5,excellent book!,Presents not only a history of the early days of Los Alamos but builds a wonderful picture of the woman who understood the deeper aspects of the land and its indigenes people.Well worth the read.
3,Not bad,It was written in a lot which they didnt really mention... but its alright I only need it for one class luckily..
5,brilliant introduction to preliminary thoughts on utilitarianism.,JS Mill being one of the most brilliant thinkers of the 19th century posits his view of the moral philosophy of utilitarianism. While cutting edge in its day / 150 years later we have had the benefit of dozens of additional philosophers of morality and political science. Stimulating to read for the concepts and examples. The average sentence consists of 8 dependent clauses and 100 words. While lengthy and complex arguments are offered / each is structurally sound. Outstanding reading that merits a solid A. It is highly recommended that you reread this book every decade or so to gain additional insights.
4,Short and important,"The foundation of consequentialist ethical theory, John Stuart Mill's Utilitarianism is a must read for anybody who wants to understand ethical theory. While we may debate what makes action right or wrong, Mill's take is one that must be acknowledged."
5,Amazing!,"While I dont agree with some of what is said, this gives a practical view of Utilitarianism, and is truly a good work of Philosophy!"
5,Where is Curtis Stigers?,"I really enjoy this album, and the other two previous releases from Curtis Stigers. I don't understand why we don't hear more from this very talented artist. His voice is wonderful, and he is awesome at playing the sax. I have never heard anyone perform with as much feeling as Curtis Stigers. I really hope that it is not as long between albums this time."
5,Jorma at his best,"This may be one of the absolute best albums Jorma Kaukonen has made (with or without Hot Tuna). His singing is better than ever - very bluesy, compelling, sensitive. The title song is a beautiful ballad, beautifully done. Tuna and Dead fans will love the Dead's ""Friend of the Devil"". Michael Falzarano's Gypsy Fire really rocks. Fine version of Mississippi Fred McDowell's ""You Got to Move"" and other good, rockin' blues compositions of Jorma's. This one is a definite winner!"
2,shower door seal,the seal was represented as a CR Lawrence product when i got it it was a cheap hardware store replacement made in china although it worked for my customer i was disappointed with the false representation i would not have purchased if i had known
2,Doesn't Match Picture,"I agree with the previous reviewers. The picture clearly shows two T's of equal width (4mm). What arrived was a CRL product with a 4mm upper T and a 5mm lower T. Returning such an inexpensive product wasn't worth my time, so I shaved off the extra width of the lower T with a razor blade and it fit fine."
1,Wrong size!! Picture and critical dimension are incorrect,"Picture shown has both ""T"" ribs 5/32"" wide. Product delivered has second ""T"" rib 6/32"" wide: Too wide for some applications, like mine. It doesn't fit."
4,doesnt turn out like you would expect it would,early movie with a different twist with ken wearing his black ha
5,Amazing and fantastic eye-witness history,"I'm still wading through this, but wish I had read this years ago. MacLean's writing style is so similar to Ian Fleming's books that you easily understand how people see MacLean as the inspiration for James Bond. His observation of people, analysis of the circumstances and situations he finds himself in bring the period to life in a way that any number of history books cannot.MacLean's account of his time in the USSR, especially his retelling of the Bukharin show trial, is fascinating and anyone has ever wondered how USSR came to end should read his account of its most disfunctional days before WWII."
4,very good book,I came to this book through a book I had just read called The Phantom Major. That was about the SAS in WWII Fitzroy Maclean was part of that unit. I had been looking to see if anyone else in that unit had written anything. I am glad I found this book. The first SAS guys were amazing people. Fitzroy Maclean happen to be one of the highest educated of those men. You take a guy who has the hardness and darning to be one of the first SAS guys. Then you add his education and diplomatic training to the mix and you have one heck of a combination. This book is really about a guy who is bigger then life living it to the fullest. Please read it.
5,Ripping Yarns,"For those of you who are not in the know Fitzroy Maclean and his adventures served as the basis for conceiving the original James Bond Novels. Ian Fleming and Maclean worked closely with each other during the war.This is the ultimate book for those who would yearn for the active life --- who wonder what it is like to be trailed by soviet spies; who think of the thrill of sleeping in pine scented forests of the Balkans while being hunted by Nazis; who would don a turban and travel with the real hard men of the Long Range Desert Group (none of those softy American seals, marines and the like) into the Western Desert during WWII --- but are too engrossed in reading to leave their armchairs.Reading this book makes one realise what it really is like to live an active life. Throw away your Anthony Robbins, if you want inspiration read this book."
4,A note of apology,"Please read my review, ""Was this the real 007?"" posted September 25th 2001. I must apologise for one glaring inaccuracy. I mention that Mr Maclean, along with Eric Newby and Wilfred Thesiger, are the last of a particular breed of Englishmen. Mr Maclean, of course, is a Scot. Thanks to those who pointed out my mistake. Hopefully you will still enjoy this excellent book."
5,"A terrific, thoughtful read","Diplomatic history, travelogue, military history, and nascent Cold War politics--Eastern Approaches has it all, and it is all very well-written."
5,Fantastic book,Great insights into how children learn and how to create interventions that effectively help struggling students!
1,I cannot recommend this book,"Due to the fact that this man may have been sexually abusing the patients under his care, I cannot recommend any of the information contained in this book.His information would definitely be clouded by the abnormal behavior this activity would exhibit."
1,Zero in this book about how to be more productive,"This is just a few case studies of how this guy diagnosed people, who were labeled as lazy, with something like ADD instead. Nice cop-out. There is zero in this book about how to be more productive."
5,Dr. Levine Does It Again !!,"Follwing on his wonderful book ""A Mind at a Time"" -- Dr. Levine now tackles one particular group of individual learners, those kids who get labeled 'lazy' & etc.. I hope teachers and school psychologists and school administrators and professors of teacher certification courses are paying attention to Dr. Levine. American education can be improved if these ideas make it into the mainstream of the education establishment."
5,Neurodevelopment,"After reading this we lined up an assessment at the study center Dr. Levine started, Success In Mind, in Durham, N.C. A very informative book."
3,you might like it more than I did,"I find it hard to like this, the Stranglers' second, album. Sure, the title track is a masterpiece, and ""Something Better Change"" was a good single, and ""English Towns"" is an understated triumph, but... well, there's not much else that I can get very enthusiastic about. The band's melodic gift is never far from the surface (example: ""Bitching"") but the aggression is often to the fore (example: ""Bitching""). Probably worked well at the time, and especially live, but it hasn't aged as well as most of their other work. Those who like their Stranglers heavier will enjoy it more than I do. It's still, of course, (and this is the old fogey in me) way better than most of the rubbish that gets into the charts these days."
5,Punk Classic,"One of the best Punk albums from 1977, a pure classic and as outrageous as any punk outing."
3,Best Album,"If you've enjoyed the early punk, the vomit-spiked hair and the bottle of beer up your pfui, you will really enjoy this!"
5,Our beagle loves these!,"I ordered several of these at a time. It's great fun to watch my beagle chase them around the kitchen as they bounce haphazardly around. Tennis balls only bounce in one direction. Booooorrring! These things are all over the place and that's what makes them cool. She REALLY got a kick out of the squeaky version, too. I'll have to get more of those..."
5,"Great book, great messages, lovely narrative",Through the storyline David manages to make us notice the wonder of the world and universe around us and then he does the really clever piece. He creates a compelling case that all of us as individuals can shape our own lives and in so doing actually contribute to the shape of the world around us and through that the universe. This book will give hope and energy to everyone who feels that they are stuck or that their life should amount to more.
3,"He's jealous, but not in the way you think","If the game's fixed, then how is Charles Barkley any better than Micheal Jordan by getting money, power and fame from it-- or at least, how does he have any room to talk, just because Jordan profits MORE? He should be suing the NBA for running a crooked game, not blaming one of its pawns. I think that he just doesn't want to bite the hand that feeds him, so he instead acts like a jealous dog and bites a pampered pet."
4,A Great re-read!,"Read this years ago....might even have the paperback still! Delightful story with great characters, and a lot of heart and suspense."
3,Mysteryromance,"A little history, a little romance, and a little mystery. The story moved quickly until the last chapter. Really liked it."
3,I agree with the reader from Chevy Chase,"This book was forced and filled with too much inconsistency. None of the characters acted or spoke in expected ways, and while a little surprise can be nice, not when it goes on for page after page. I couldn't get a handle on Jessica and Lucas and was never even sure if I liked them. Their great love affair felt unnatural and forced and I wasn't even sure until about 2/3's of the way through the book if Lucas even liked Jessica, much less loved her. And while it was evident that Jessica had at one time loved Lucas, since she couldn't remember it, those feelings couldn't be shared with the reader. Jessica seemed to trust Lucas, yet she believed he was a murderer. That, in itself, is cause for much confusion."
3,Not up to her usual standard,"I love this author, but this book just missed the mark for me. It seemed forced and somewhat rough. Perhaps her editor let her down a bit? And the Catholic portion was just not realistic. At that time in English history, Roman Catholics were just not tolerated with a good grace by the aristocracy. And some of the religious jargon was off, like the recitation of the Hail Mary in the beginning. OK, so I'm being picky, I'm sorry. It's just that too much of these reminders (and they were throughout the entire book), that something's disrupting the flow, and it becomes disjointed. For me anyway."
3,"just the facts, please","While the info is interesting, the quiz format is not; you have to constantly turn the page to get any answers. It should have been advertised as having this format."
4,Fun!,This was a fun book that we used on a road trip. Although a lot of the questions were pretty tough (at least for me) it was a good book and we learned from the different questions and answers.
3,America Trivia,The book was delivered in a timely manner and in good condition. My family and I have enjoyed reading and using the information contained in the book although it tends to contain a lot of very old information which seniors would tend to know more than the younger generation. Overall it was a good purchase.
3,Good coffee table book,"This is a great coffee table book, it has a lot of different American trivia. My friends and family all pick it up and start testing their knowledge or learn new things."
5,GREAT,"these is a great book, i bought these for my father's birthday, and he will love this book!!!!! and it is so hard to find a book like this."
5,Really good,"Really thorough book of American Trivia. Appreciate the breadth and depth of subjects, that hit on many segments of America and American history."
2,The only big thing about The Big Book Of American Trivia is the disappointment level.,"It's not big at all! If you were to take all your books and arrange them by height, this would probably be right in the middle, maybe even a bit on the smaller side. Do not be fooled! If you're looking for a truly big book, keep looking. Always check the product dimensions."
2,America Trivia,I am an Activities Director for seniors and am disappointed in the American Trivia publication. The topics are repetitive and not enough stimuli
5,Loads of Fun,"OK, so we're all in a patriotic mood now, and why not? America has a lot to celebrate, and this book is all about every aspect of American culture and history. I found this book in my doctor's waiting room and liked it so much I bought it myself. Everything is here--history, TV, movies, pop music, food, trends, politics, especially the US presidents, lots more. I like the format of having the answers on the backs of the question pages. It's good clean fun, and we've enjoyed it with the family."
3,"Good, but there are better ones","This book has a lot of trivia questions. And that's one of the reasons why it isn't a great book. With 3,000 questions, one has to strain to find the interesting ones. A much better bet is the book titled ""Quizzing"" which I found had interesting answers to almost all the questions it carried."
5,Excellent Help for Teachers,"As a teacher of Special Education, when I found this book, I knew I had found something great. I found it to be a great help in understand IQ scores, parts of IQ scores, and disabilities. There were very specific ideas to help students in your classroom with various disabilities. There was a great section for parents and helping parents learn to accept their child's abilities and disabilities. I bought this book for myself and later lent it out, I never had it returned. I talked my school into ordering one for every Special Ed teacher in our school. All of us have found this to be an excellent reference."
4,. Tarantella D'Altri Tempi,"Though not being a professional in music, this piece really caputured my attention, it has a special way to leave a lasting impression. I really, enjoyed the rhythm and flow of this piece of music. Beautiful dance number and very romantic. The steady beat, keeps the passions soaring."
5,A wrong made right.,Ordered this for a coworker for an xmas present about 2 weeks before xmas. Waited on it to arrive but it never did. Emailed amazon and they shipped out another set that I was able to get before xmas and give to my coworker. Awesome customer service. She really enjoyed the present.
5,Grease ! & @,Great movies for my older grandaughters - similar to High School MusicalGreat service and price
4,An Awesome Book,this was a great book. Ron Burt is a very talented man. he was my substitute teacher and that is how i heard about his book. he is an awesome writer and loving brother. if u are reading this Mr.Burt good job. im Crystal from Mr. Canos first period class at King High School. Keep up the good writing..
3,not as good as expected,"I expected to hear something very romantic and stylish latino dance music. But it turned to be an ordinary clarinet with band. It has some latino rythem, but not very strong. It seems to me this is not a latino dance music. The player has some CD better than this one."
2,Did not help our dog's scratching.,"Sorry, but this shampoo did not help our dog's allergic reactions to summer grass and leaves. Went back to regular shampoo."
5,Works,"My yorkie has very sensitive skin. He is constantly scratching, flaking and bleeding. This really works. He had relief right after the first shampoo!"
3,dog shampoo,"When I first recieved it, I did exactly what it said to do. It showed no results, however, It also said that it would take a while. I am still bathing him twice a week as recommended. His hair is returning slowly. He still has the yeast smell. The product is okay. But not what it was advertised to be."
4,seems like it worked,"I have 3 Hairless Chinese Crested dogs, 2 of which have the skin issues. So I purchased this to try and help. It seems to be helping to clear up their skin."
4,cure for my dog's skin problem,i have a chinese crested hairless dog . it's common for the=is breed to have skin problems. mine was blessed with pearly cysts on her legs. this shampoo has started to dry them up. something no other product that i've tried has been able to do. i'm very happy with Keratolux.
1,BEWARE!!!! NOT PLENUM Cable,"Beware. Even if you type in Cat6 plenum in the amazon search engine and even though this seller states on the product description that the cable is plenum it is not. It is manufactured by Monoprice product ID: 8108. Please check their website and you will see this cable for $105.24. If you look at the larger views of the cable on the website you will see the red and white box, that is exactly what I received. This seller deliberately does not show the correct picture of the product."
2,Music is okay if you can get it to play,"This is my Christmas music purchase of the year; well I also purchased the Muppet Family Christmas on which John Denver sings and was actually the inspiration to purchase this. I was also influenced by the ""limited edition"" tag and that it contained extra tracks. Apparently there was a version a few years ago that had several tracks cut off. This one is simply the complete version of the album with all 13 tracks as listed. I might have given it 3 stars, but this CD will not play in my kitchen mounted, Sony undercabinet player that plays every other CD just fine. It must be a production problem where the index isn't being read. But that's the main player I use for Christmas Music and so a disappointment and a return to make."
3,Not his best,"I totally agree with the music fan from Kansas. I thought the songs were very melancholy and almost a bit depressing in the way he sings the songs. Rocky Mountain Christmas has much more energy and is a much better cd. Also, you've got to get the John Denver and the Muppets Christmas cd."
2,"Pleasant, but bland.","This collection contains nice renditions of many classic Christmas carols. The title track is a delightful song, but the remainder of the collection sounds flat in comparison."
4,Neonatology,I absolutely love this book. It is very informative. I purchased it beause I am considering working in the NICU. I would definitely recommend.
1,See a copy before you buy,"I don't like saying negative things and I've debated posting this review for quite a while but I feel I must. I'm so mad at myself for having bought this book just from reading descriptions that I have to say something.I have quite a few photography technique books and this one was one book too many. It has some nice images along with brief explanations on how they were created. The problem I have with the book are the manipulated images, which make up about half of the book. I'm sorry, but I just don't see the point in adding water, clouds and birds to all those images, and often it's the same bird. I'd recommend looking through the book before purchasing, and if you can put up with the manipulated images, go for it, but I just don't see the point in them. Another thing-I haven't gone digital yet but I imagine that the manipulated images can be produced quicker on the computer nowadays."
2,Not enough technical information,"I purchased this book expecting to learn techniques for darkroom effects, but the book didn't teach me much. After the introduction, there were a few pages on techniques, but being a photo student, I already understood them. The rest of the book was mostly a showcase of the artist's photographs, which is fine because many were beautiful, but it was just not what I was looking for. I just wanted more specific examples of each technique instead of the thought process for each photograph."
1,Falling apart already...,"Washed these in cold water once and the stitching came undone in a lot of places, and they started to fade, cheap for a reason...."
5,Clarity and logic on an often-muddled subject: leadership,"Dr. Joni has created a clear, logically compelling case for a new kind of leadership appropriate for the complex age we live in. Too many leaders (and leadership models) still believe that leading is all about making decisions in the splendid isolation of the corporate suite. Dr. Joni shows how to create teams of inside and outside advisors that will keep you from becoming the next Enron -- and avoid being blindsided by the competition you never saw coming from the corner office. More than that, there is profound advice here for leaders at all levels of their careers trying to navigate the tricky waters of corporate politics. A must-read for business people today."
3,missing pages,"This book is a pretty good read. I am writing at this moment to complain about the missing pages, 295-342 are missing. This would be a discussion of the Marianas campaign. This is the paperback version, purchased July of '08. Beware the missing pages! Otherwise it is a pretty good read, but for me I prefer a deeper look at each battle, rather than an overview."
5,Only single-volume needed!,"Truly the only single-volume Pacific theater history one needs. Spector is well documented in his history and historiography, presenting and evaluating differing schools of thought on the Allied campaigns on the Second World War. The primary focus is US grand strategy and the internal struggles that came with it, but the author never fails to hail the men at the pointy end of the spear. Most importantly, Spector is accessible, achieving an academic work that's a pleasure to read."
3,One important caveat: read this before you buy,"(Kudos to Amazon for having inserted the words ""Spanish Version"" soon after I originally posted the following:)One important caveat: If you look at the ""larger picture"" on the web page, you'll notice it says ""Introduccio'n en Castellano"" and ""diccionario"". The introduction is indeed in Spanish, and the dictionary is Greek->Spanish.Two minor quibbles: The web page says ""leather bound"", but it's not. It's cheapo leather-look, as would really be expected at this price - so no big complaint, but be aware you're not getting a terrific deal on a leather-bound GNT. And, getting really picky, the font is decent-sized, but with very thin strokes; I'm finding it irritating to read.A better choice for some might be the new Zondervan ""Reader's Greek New Testament"" (ISBN 0310248884) which has a more-readable font and much nicer cover, font, gold-edged pages, etc. for around the same price."
1,Oh my god! How pathetic!,"Ok, lemme be honest ... I downloaded the mp3s for this album, I listened to them, and I decided NOT to buy the album -- EVER. I've bought all the other albums, so I AM supporting Funker Vogt, but ""T"" is a ridiculous album and FV doesn't deserve my money. Heck, they should have paid ME for having to listen to those mp3s. This album has NONE of the intensity of the bands other works. It seems to me that they just wanted to keep the fans happy until they could come up with another album. I dunno. Read the other reviews for more info."
4,"Solid, but becoming outdated","In 10 words or less, this book is: Full of great information, laced with advertisements, and becoming outdated.I bought this back in 05, and I carry it with me to any friends house when they request I lend a hand to any problem. It covers all the hardware in modern computing, from the hard-drive, soundcards, monitor, and speakers.It talks about various minor to major XP hacks, awesome downloadable tools and utilities, understanding XP, improving boot-time, overclocking, and more.On the downside, every 20 or more pages, there's an ad touting it's magazine, and much of the online content it talks about has now become trial/buy versions, and like anything in the computer industry, it doesn't help much with Vista. Like I said before, it's a bit outdated.I would still recommend buying this if you're a noob to real hacking/mods."
5,Title Mozart Die Zauberflote,Mozart: Die ZauberfloteI really loved this performance it was truly first class!The star performance of leading singers were superb and the whole opera has never been better performed.
3,Lovely version,"This is a very good performance of The Magic Flute. I must admit, the black-face Monostatos is a little off-putting (what? you can't find a good black tenor for the part?), but the singing is good, and in German (important to me). My favorite version of The Magic Flute is still that of the Düsseldorf Marionettentheater, but since that is not available on DVD, this will have to do."
3,Hasn't arrived...,"The product looks great, and I'm sure it is, but it hasn't arrived yet! As I didn't go for the tracking option, I guess it could be lost forever in the post system. Fingers crossed for a late delivery"
5,Amazing,I'm 23 years old so I've grown up on Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. This ranks as probably my all time favorite stand up special. Amazing.
5,"Hilarious, especially for parents","The best video to get for your favorite exhausted parents of small children. I would not hesitate to buy this video if you HAVE children, but since I don't I bought it for several friends with kids and they were literally falling over laughing. Insightful, funny, reality based comedy about the craziness of being a parent. Yet he manages to poke fun at kids without being mean or cruel. Funny, really, for anyone - especially the dentist routine!"
4,Bill Cosby Himself,Loved this video - could watch it over and over...I had seen it before but wanted to have it in my collection of comedians of the 50's
4,One of his finest,Definitely a great comedic stand up performance. Bill does not have many live video performances that I can find. This is a gem.
5,Very Funny,Once again Bill Cosby's humor is great for the whole family to listen to and to relate to as well.
5,great job,This DVD will be enjoyed for many years.Service was fast and deserve the 5 star rating.This is a must see performance.
5,Now I UNDERSTAN!,"When I first watched this with my father years ago, he would laugh until he cried. I laughed but never really got the full gist of it all. Now, I am 42 with 3 year old twins...BOY DO IT GET IT NOW!!!! I just watched this the other day on Starz and I fell out laughing, crying out laughing like my father did years ago...now I know why he was laughing so hard. I can remember my mother calling us: Jesus Christ and Dammnit and SOB! We as kid knew who she was yelling at by the tone and name...lol. Cosby is a genius! He took real life and made it into his stand up routine and finally to the Cosby show which I MISS SOOO MUCH!!! Cosby Himself is the best if you are a parent to more than one child...you'll get it once he starts talking about his kids...yes, I used to be an intellectual myself Mr. Cosby...no more! :) Best buy you will make if you are a Cosby Fan!"
5,Funny..Funny...Movie,If you haven't seen this old movie from long long ago...You must purchase it...This is BillCosby at his best...I gave it to my son and him and his family really enjoyed it...Thanksfor offering it...
5,The ultimate standard to which all other family entertainment must compare,"What can I say about this show except that I can listen and watch it over and over again and continue to laugh as hard as I did the first time I heard it? This is the epitome of what clean, family humor should be, and Cosby is at his finest in this act. I recently ordered this DVD version for a friend to replace a VHS cassette that had literally been worn out from repeat viewing and averted a rebellion in her home. She was ever so thankful as were her children, a whole new generation being exposed to the funniest stuff I grew up with. Buy this, watch this, laugh until your cheeks and sides hurt."
5,Cosby At His Best,"I would of loved to see this live, but i was not born yet, i didn't relize how funny bill cosby was untile i saw this. everything he says is true to the bone. from drunks, to dentist, to children. this is a great movie. mr. cosby is one of the best comedians of all time. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
3,A Cosby classic with reservation,"The quality of this video is excellent and a reminder of how Cosby could wow an audience with his stories. Many are delightful--the dentist, the birth of the child and some of his views on the marriage relationship. Where I had difficulty was with his dialogue on raising kids and his harsh criticism. Parenting is not easy but I feel he goes on way too long as an irrational parent. Maybe this was status quo in the 70's but viewing it in the 21st century I find some of it unncessary."
3,Loose disc.,"I purchased this disc as a gift. Upon receipt, the item sounded like many shattered pieces shifting about inside the case. Although this was intended to give as a gift, I felt compelled to ensure that I wasn't passing on damaged goods, so I had to break the cellophane seal and check. I was relieved to find that the disc had simply come loose from it's intended molding and no scratches were apparent. It was a bit embarrassing to explain to the recipient of the gift that it was in fact NEW and not a resale DVD. Also, I tried to find a way to contact Amazon or the merchant to ask about what to do if the item was broken. I found no way to contact either entity other than returning the item with the label enclosed. I needed this item for a gift and didn't have time to ship it back and wait for a response. A customer service number or email is needed, Amazon.com!"
1,Crap,The DVD didnt work. I've seen this before and its hilarious but whoever manufactured the DVD put out a terrible product. I threw it away having never watched it.
1,not recommended,I didn't like this that much - parts are ok but in general it's too slow and something about it I don't like - so fast forwarded after 10 minutes and got done with it quickly.
1,What a waste of time,"I had never seen a Bill Cosby stand-up show before and was thrilled to get my hands on this one. the fatal error I might have made was to see Chris Rock before I saw Cosby, Because after CR, everyone else sounds so average. Anyways, I stopped viewing this after 30min as I had not laughed a single time. The jokes about the weekend and alcoholics, as well as the much vaunted dentist skit, were all terribly weak. I bet if Pryor, Murphy or Rock had used the same material, they would have brought the house down.I am very disappointed and i confess I made a bad investment here."
4,very funny,Bill Cosby is great. This stand up is very funny. He is very clean is his comedy. Would recommend item
5,Funnier than I remember!,"Great DVD, I saw him live and wanted to see the video again that I saw as a child! Hilarious"
5,Classic Cosby,"This stand up routine is sure to please anyone who has ever been a child or spent any amount of time with children. The first time I saw this act, I laughed so had I cried. His physical comedy and timing really make him a one of a kind comedian. I can not wait to add the DVD version to my collection!"
3,A little dated,"Really good comedy stands up over time and this was just average. Also, his tone comes across a little preachier than I remembered. Mainly I bought the DVD for my kids, as an example of clean but still funny comedy yet they were bored. Not bad for the low price, but I'll be donating it to the library rather than revisiting it again."
5,Brilliant,"Almost two decades later, Bill Cosby's masterful stand-up routine ""Himself"" is just as hilarious as it was back in 1982. Why? The topics he discusses are universal and have quite literally set the groundwork for lots of modern-day observational comedians such as Jerry Seinfeld. From drinking on the weekends to the minutia of family life, Cosby takes in the details of daily life to filter out only the good stuff.Cosby's dentist routine is one of the most fall-out-of-your-seat hilarious routines of all time, and even the most jaded of people will surely find humor in this.Overall, it's impossible not to recommend this film to anyone who wants a riotous laugh, and I look forward to the day that they port this over to DVD so that it will become truly collectible."
5,One of the greatest stand-up comedians ever,"Bill Cosby has an unmatched quality to his stand-up comedy. No one else can brag of an hour's worth of this level of good, clean comedy. While other comics resort to vulgar language and constant sexual references, Cosby continues to have a type of comedy that anyone can enjoy.Nothing more than Bill with a chair and a microphone, ""Himself"" is a source of great, non-stop comedy that is well worth its low retail cost. Anyone who enjoys good stand-up should not hesitate to pick up this classic."
4,"Bill Cosby, Himself","I have seen this before and I really enjoyed the sitcom. I wanted to see it again, so I purchased it, so I could let a coworker borrow it because she had never seen it before. Bill Cosby is a great comedian without all of the language to bleep out. I enjoy watching his facial expressions when he describes funny things."
5,The Best Stand Up Ever!!,"This video is the best! I have never laughed so hard in my life. I had to shut the TV off because I couldn't breathe from all the laughing. The trip to the dentist is the best, and Bill's ""right on"" analysis of kids was like watching my own life. I saw this video for the first time over 5 years ago and it is just as funny today. If you ever watch/own a stand up video make it Bill Cosby Himself. You won't be sorry!"
5,Cosby at his best,"If you have kids, you can't go wrong with this one. A laugh out loud stand-up on parenthood. If you have grown kids with little kids coming along share a copy with them for Christmas."
4,portion of DVD is worth buying it,the monologue about drinking and dentist is very funny and its worth it. Always liked Bill Cosby's show and comedy
3,Great Drawer; Terrible Instructor,"I checked this book out at my library mainly to try to get some ideas on how to draw animals more realistically (making the hair look more real). While I was amazed by the drawings in the book, I really didn't learn anything from it. The author should have gone into more depth with the demonstrations. They are each broken into three steps: the outline, the basic shading, and then it's done. So many steps are skipped, so you don't really get an idea of how the author did the drawing. Again, the author's drawings are incredible, I just wish he had gone into more detail on how he did them."
5,Art book,Great reference book to add to my studio collection. Very well described and a useful book to have for future work.
2,¿Que puedo decir?,"Yo me considero un gran fan de Sasha. Me parece de las pocas ex-timbiriches que es fiel a si misma y hace lo que ella quiere.Quiero dividir mi comentario en dos:1 Ella canta bien, maneja bien su voz en las canciones y se percibe el sentimiento en su voz. Es algo totalmente diferente a lo que ella había hecho antes.2 EL CD ES TERRIBLEMENTE ABURRIDO, por mas bien que ella cante es imposible escuchar mas de dos canciones juntas. Es demasiado monotono. Se necesita estar con borracho con tequila para poder escucharlo.¡SASHA VUELVE A LO TUYO, 11:11 Y TRAMPAS DE LUZ, HAN SIDO TUS MEJORES TRABAJOS!"
2,La Tariacuri?,"Sasha, que te paso? Tu voz es muy buena para cantar lo que quieras, pero este disco es definitivamente para adoloridos y borrachos en la cantina.Ademas que el tono que le das a todos los temas, el disco resulta sumamente aburrido como mencionaron en otro comentario.Ojala y tu proxima produccion sea algo mas interesante."
2,WHAT'S WRONG WITH HER VOICE?,"BUENO, QUE MAS PUEDO DECIR, ES UNA PENA QUE HAYA GRABADO FINGIENDO SU MELODICA VOZ.QUERIENDO IMITAR A NO SE QUIEN ,.EVOLUCION? TAL VEZ, PERO SI LAS HUBIESE CANTADO CON SU VOZ NORMAL, ESTE HUBIERA SIDO UNA JOYA MUSICAL,YA QUE LA MUSICA ES BASTANTE BUENA,PERO LA CAGO AL HACE ESOS PUJIDOS AL CANTAR!!!"
5,Easy Cooking,"First off it should be mentioned that this is a very attractive cookbook with great photographs that inspire cooking. I've cooked a bunch of things out of this book and, as somebody who doesn't have time to attempt huge and complex recipes and never wants to fail, this book is perfect for me.The recipes are very diverse, from pancakes to stir fry. Most are quick (under 45 minutes certainly). They are straight-forward to prepare and yet have a creative twist that gives them personality. You'll most certainly find some favorites in Cook 1.0. Since they are easy to remember without looking at the book every time you go to the store, you will find these dishes in heavy rotation."
3,Cooking,"Not a bad cookbook. However, it's probably just as easy to get the vegetarian recipes off the Internet. All in all, just OK."
4,Wonderul experience with seller,I had previously tried to order this book from another seller and was not treated very fairly. This order though was sent in good condition and in a reasonable amount of time. I appreciate such customer treatment.K
5,Thriller,If you like blood and gore this is the movie for you! The subtitles and action will keep you guessing.
5,awesome flic,"GREAT movie!!! Lee Byung-hun and Choi Man-sik are incredible!!! Be forewarned, this is not a film for the squeamish, everyone else, enjoy at your own risk!!!"
2,Disappointing Film Noir,"I purchased expecting to see the battle of good vs. evil inside a young man's mind: the psychological edge of matters, that is. And I was very disappointed. It was, on the whole, a relatively humane treatment of savagery, that is, given the topic: but yet still too violent, and exagerated. Further, the whole plot became increasingly improbable and without much, if any, of the noetic and spiritual insight I was hoping for. I gave up on the movie 25 odd minutes from the end: it is quite long. In short, too much meaningless cruelty, and not enough thought, or even for that matter, plot. I advise staying with the classics, such as Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", Hitchcock's ""Rope"", or perhaps one of Brian De Palma's suspense mysteries. Another film of late, that I highly recommend, btw, is ""Dark Portals: The Chronicles of Vidocq"", starring French actor Gerard Depardieu."
3,Extreme at its extremest range,"There are some movies that affect you for so long that you start wondering if your mind is still there with you. I have watched this movie 2 days ago and I am still in shock. If it wasn't showing graphic violence, dismembering, cannibalism, and human fecal, I would rate the movie 5 stars. Why 5 stars? Because the theme of revenge is the most attractive topic to read about or to watch and this movie is the best so far depicting it."
2,What a waste of talent,"This is a beautifully-shot, intensely-acted film that, unfortunately, has no intrinsic merit. Long and nasty, it is disease on film, no matter how accomplished the film making. I feel diminished in my soul for having watched this. Kim soo-huan's hunt for the killer in the beginning of the film was excellent. The rest was a waste. Referred to as a revenge/horror movie, the true horror is that the over-the-top violence becomes, ultimately, tedious."
1,cold and flat,"The psycho doesn't look that mean or even if he's a psychopath who doesn't look like one that didnt come off either. Highlight of the film was when he turned tables on the good doctor I think because horror then had a frame of reference .hero or victims seem two dimentional card board cut outs I cant empathise with. This seems to be a recurring fault with Asian horror flicks. The flashing blood and gore ho-hum seen it before. The real crime is there is no real build up before killer comes comes out into the open. This film is leagues away from "" Audition "" now that's scary. I wish someone would make a horror film on the life of H.H. Holmes and go into his torture and dismemberment rooms in Howard's Castle that he built under everyones noses downtown Chigago doubled as a hotel at one point in contrast to life as a husband buisness man and doctor. Now that would be a flick.The hero detective boyfriend was true eye candy for an asian man that redeemed the film !!!!!!!!"
3,Extreme Vengeance!,"This movie brings the saying ""an Eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" to its ultimate literal meaning! I think what captivated me through the entire movie was the superb acting of both leads. I didnt mind the gore, but I think the movie was kept 30 minutes too long. A few subplots (the taxi rides, the canniba, the clinicl) could be edited out to make this movie more tight."
4,Great Movie!!,"As Im sure alot of people are also very bored with the lack of GOOD horror movies that have been coming out in the past few years, I decided to give this movie a shot since it had decent reviews.I have to say, I really enjoyed this movie. When it comes to movies, especially horror movies, Im pretty picky.Theres something about asian film makers, they know exactly how to pull you in and get you hooked.I would most certainly recommend this movie!"
4,I saw the devil English subtitled,"Not one for subtitled movies but this movie has made me think differently about having to read through out the whole movie. What you miss in subtitles they make up for in there acting. Not a kid friendly movie at all... to much of everything. One heck of a movie. Revenge of a dead women and her man lets the guy live, but he never learns and with each evil way a worse corse of action is taken to revenge her death and try to save others from this devilish creature."
5,Legion:ISTD,"This is one o those movies that'll bother you whether you're into the genre or not. It may seem to take a while before it takes off, but when it does, HOLD ON!!! IT'S GORETASTICK!!!"
5,"Awesome Bluray, Awesome Movie","In my opinion, the acting in this movie is awesome. The bluray quality is awesome. Watching this movie made me want to buy more Korean blurays. Hollywood is getting lame."
4,Intense,"Dark, twisted look at human nature. Our hero grows more evil as he chases a serial killer and he begins to become his prey. Fascinating."
5,Why I gave it a 5 star rating.,Why am I giving it a 5 star rating and recommend it?Quite simple.. really...Because.. if my pregnant wife was beheaded by a blade wielding psychopath with complete disregard for human dignity who is dead set on creating mayhem and raping women and teenage girls.....I would do exactly what the lead character does to the murdering misogynist.. I understand the madness behind the revenge... I get it...and so will you.
1,Tasteless,"Gory, unsettling, violent ! Could not finish ! I felt it was a waste of time and the kind of thing the younger generation should not be exposed to !"
5,Masterly Crafted,"Ji-Woon Kim is one of my favorite Asian directors. The movie runs well over two hours and I was left wanting more. You do need a thick stomach for this but if you love the gory revenge movies that Asian Cinema seems to have perfected you will love this one.Acting, cinematography, script, all top notch. I even dare say, better than most American movies out this year."
4,Didn't know what I was buying,I wish there were more details in what this thing was and what it was for. I'm not that much of a techie and I wanted something to connect my camcorder to the pc to edit film. I thought it was a basic fire wire hookup. This wasn't necessary at all. Too bad you can't return things once they are already opened. I'll try to sell it on ebay.
4,'Read Between the Lines' and 'Tool Box' under a new name,"This two-CD set is actually two full albums: Disc 1 is Read Between the Lines, Disc 2 is Tool Box. Wouldn't you think maybe they would say that somewhere? It doesn't say anything about that on the cover or on the back of the CD, on the scanty liner notes, or on the discs that are labeled only with the track lists, the artist's name and the label names. Not a hint of the album name anywhere on the discs. As far as I know these CDs sound just like the two original albums. And I like them so I only knocked this set down one star for deception!"
2,Low quality video,"The video was of subpar quality, due to the amateur photographers. Overall not a very good video. Will be looking for a better quality video."
2,Don't bother,Yep...Part 1. Can't even imagine how there could be a Part 2. I didn't learn a thing from this one. I think I wasted my time on this flick!
3,Worth a look,"Better editing would have really helped. With that said, this was a very amateurish, but interesting, account of Bigfoot. Definitely worth a look for the enthusiast."
1,Really Badly Produced,"A few people decided to go out into the woods of Arizona and use a standard VHS camera, yes a VHS camera (in 2008)to document some made-up foot prints of a Sasquatch. The dialog, sound mixing and story line are just plain bad. It's almost worth renting for $1.99 to see how badly some things can be produced."
5,Cilla,"This CD caught my attention because being a Beatles fan I wanted to add it to my library. Personally, I like some selections better than others (in this CD). But it must be noted that Cilla displays her talent in all of the cuts. This CD is part of musical history."
1,For the lesser mind,"Not very interesting and dated, like something out of Reader's Digest. I laughed a lot at the dated profundity but the list was not quite as funny as Letterman's top 10."
3,Interesting but very much dated,"This book needs to be updated to include modern greats, such as Einstein etc. Otherwise, an interesting and informative experience, although the poetry part was a bit dull."
4,Inspirational Introduction to Will Durant,"This was my first introduction to Will Durant and it did not dissapoint. It was a very quick and easy read as well as being both a great historical refresher and a great insight into the mind of this legendary figure. The book includes top ten lists of the greatest thinkers, poets, and peaks of human progress among others. Durant's commentary is very insightful and his selection methodology is well reasoned. This has inspired me to read more of his works and texts from his Top 100 Best Books for Education."
2,Disappointing,"I've been working my way through The Story of Civilization, and loving it. Fast, fun, educational, and entertaining. So when I found this audiobook before a long car trip, I thought I would enjoy it.I was wrong. Okay, from time to time it provides some interesting insights. But it is full of ""insights"" that are obvious (Plato was one of the greatest philosophers), and odd (Whistler's paintings are faddish), with lots of fluff in between (long paragraphs about why people might object to Aquinas being called one of the world's greatest philosophers, with very little time left to explain what Aquinas' contribution was).Skip it unless someone gives you a copy for free."
4,A Revelation !,"I am not an economist. In fact, I hold these guys in low esteem. But I stumbled across 'Speaking of Liberty' when searching for references to 'Globalisation' and 'Free Trade'. What a revelation ! I hadn't thought of how close economics and politics really are. But Lew Rockwell makes that point very clear. Just read the chapters on 'War and Freedom' and 'Free Trade vs War'. His points about the Gold Standard, Business Cycles, and - what I see as extreme - Capitalism are debatable and I disagree with some of his findings. But I have to admit he's got some challenging points. He writes very well, his book is a pleasure to read. His view of 'Free Trade' is just devastating. Tremendous book."
5,Speaking of Liberty Review,"Being a daily reader at www.LewRockwell.com, I am familiar with Lew's writing and his devotion to liberty, free markets, peace and property rights. This book is a most worthwhile collection of some of his best words on the subject; such that I ordered one for my father, one for my children and one for myself. We all would do well to learn what freedom means and what liberty yields and Lew's contribution, Speaking of Liberty, is a great place to start."
4,Award winning book of poetry,"This book was awarded ""The Poetry Book of the Year 2005"" by the American Authors Association.Fabel's poetry is likened to that of Robert Frost. The author makes excellent use of the iambic pentameter in his work. Rather than end of line rhyme, he employs imagery and human passion as his method."
1,terrible service,"It was a disaster. I ordered the book for my son's class at Auburn. I never got the book! When I tried to have it tracked, I was told it was through a 3rd party and could not be tracked! It said nothing on the order that it was not through the site posted. They kept telling me it would be here any day. He waited all month for his book, and did not have it for the test!! I will not ever use Amazon or this site for any books that need to be delivered in a timely manner. I now have to go through the process of turning in a claim!"
3,Enjoy a tour through the history of the world jewelry,I choosed this book because I study jewelry and I recommend the book to anybody who is studing the same.
2,A Mixed Bag,"The strength of the film is its technical aspect. For the time, the special effects are quite good. Acting is also strong. I was disappointed in the plot. The script just doesn't accomplish the job. Essentially the theme is ""art"" (in this case music)is superior to business. All business people are evil and only artists know how to celebrate life. Violence, robbery, and deception of any kind is justified to teach the evil businessman a lesson. That's the subplot that just doesn't hold up.Jimmy Stewart's character, working with Paulette Goddard's character, ""save the day"" by staging a lottery, which they have previously discussed was not legal. Here again, there's no logic. They do the very thing the script writers prohibited them from doing. It's a non sequituer."
3,Interesting Film,"Ever the professionals, both Jimmy Stewart and Paulette Goddard gave this film their best effort. Goddard was certainly a gorgeous woman, and her musical number in this film was very interesting...her legendary charm is highly evident. The number itself is a bit odd...she begins in a glamorous gown, singing...then switches to a female version of a Spanish male cabellero (sp?) outfit, flirting outrageously with all the girls...then switches into another glamorous gown and dances the tango (extremely well) with her male partner, who appears to be authentically entranced by her...the first time I saw it, I thought, ""What was THAT???"" Only Goddard could have pulled it off. It didn't appear that she and Stewart had much in the chemistry department, but they did give it their best effort. It's a pleasant film."
1,Worst adaptation ever,"Every year, I enjoy reading, watching and listening to as many different adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" as I can. And since the price of this one was right - 25 cents - hey, let's try it.Well, it stinks. Why? Because they cut the story down to less than half an hour!! I kept thinking ""What's the rush?"" Why cut it so severely?Does Lord Olivier shine? Who can tell? It all went by so fast!"
5,Amazing! Stunning!,"I was in Egypt and thought I had discovered a CD which wasn't available normally. So I was surprised to see it's listed here. I've listened to this album a thousand times and can sing N'Dour's ""Sama Guent Gun"" almost by heart (though I don't understand what it means).You're depriving yourself of a true musical wonder if you pass up this one."
4,"Funny, sentimental... and good music, too.","Despite the fact that it features John Denver, whom many people dislike, this album is one of the best things to come out of the Muppet phenomenon. Denver is an excellent musician, and the Muppet singers hold up their end through both classic Xmas tunes and lesser-known seasonal songs. The most notable tune here is ""When the River Meets the Sea,"" but don't miss Rowlf the Dog singing a melancholy ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" A good break from the normal Xmas tunes, especially in a season that has so little musical variety."
4,Denver & the Muppets make Christmas come alive,This is one of my favourite Christmas albums of all time. We had a copy of the cassette many years ago {which went missing) so I had to get a copy of the CD when it became available. I'm not disappointed. Denver remains one of the great musical poets of our time and coupled with the endearing muppets provides for a warm musical feast. I particularly like The Twelve Days of Christmas and Silent Night is one of my alltime favourite versions of this classic carol. Goodnight Kermie; Goodnight John!
2,This CD is missing 3 great songs!!!,"I ordered this CD thinking it would be like the LP, but discovered [...]that it is missing 3 songs. The rest of the CD is good, but I was greatly disappointed in that the CD is incomplete."
5,Unforgettable,"My children are grown, have children of their own, but we still check out each other regarding this Christmas CD. It is the one we put on when we decorated the tree, the one that spans generations and continues to live on in our hearts. It has songs of pure fun, such as Twelve Days and Little Saint Nick, and pure heart-warmers, as in It's in Every One of Us. It will live in your thoughts and deeds throughout the winter months and warm you to your toes."
4,One of my favorite parts of Christmas,"I had a bad copy of John Denver & The Muppets. I played it until it no longer played any coherent sound. For several years I have searched for another tape and happened across it again while searching for fundraisers of all things. Not many people, who have seen the Muppets, cannot relate to at least one of them no matter what their age. This collection of music is no different. It contains many old and new songs, funny and serious, and I am sure it will be a favorite of many for years to come. If you are a child at heart, you will love John Denver & The Muppets."
4,"A must-have, but missing some of its best","I had an old cassette tape of the original vinyl LP of ""A Christmas Together,"" so I was thrilled to find it available on CD. As much as I love regaining access to this classic collection of Muppets, I was highly disappointed to learn that two of my favourite tracks, ""Where the River Meets the Sea,"" and the touching and beautifully simple recording of Rolf (Jim Henson) and John Denver singing ""Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"" are missing from this album. It's particularly sad to lose that track. Still, the rest are well-worth the owning, but I do wish that the studio would re-issue the CD with *all* the songs intact."
2,I'm so disapointed :(,"My parents own 2 copies of the LP version of this album. I've listened to it FOREVER. I bought it thinking it was the version that I had grown up with. It isn't...If you've EVER listened to the LP version, and that is the version you love, DON'T BUY THIS VERSION.Other then that, If you love the Muppets and their music. This is a great set of music"
5,A cherished memory.,"After seeing the original TV special, I was compelled to buy the album and promptly wore it out. What a joy to find it's on CD. Hard to not enjoy the delight and whimsy of the late Jim Henson and John Denver in this wonderful album. My only regret is that the video of the original show is not available."
5,Splendid!,The album is a wonderful Christmas treat. It is funloving and at times beautiful. I look forward to sharing it with my kids and grandchildren.
5,This album has been our family tradition for many years.,"Our two children grew up with this album at each Christmas. We played the tape in the car during our Christmas shopping. and although they are grown now, this is still the album they request to hear on Christmas Day. We even have the sheet music and gather round the piano to play and sing these tunes each Christmas Eve. Thank you John Denver and Muppets for making such a wonderful tradition and memory for us."
2,Missing Songs,"This CD is missing songs from the original soundtrack. When you select to hear certain songs from this website, it plays the songs that are missing. For example, ""Little Saint Nick"" is not on the CD along with some other songs."
5,GREAT CD. FAMILY FAVORITE!!,MY KIDS WHO ARE NOW GROWN ADULTS STILL LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!! IT BRINGS BACK MANEY FOND MEMORIES OF WHEN THEY WERE KIDS AND LISTENED TO IT AT CHRISTMAS TIME! WE STILL PLAY IT EVERY CHRISTMAS!!!!
3,John Denver and the Muppets: A Christmas Together,The CD was in perfect condition but the CD case was cracked even though it was packaged in very good shipping material.
5,Traditional tunes with Heart!,"This CD has something for everyone, such as a drama queen in the ""12 days"" cut, Carribean beats in""Chrismas is comming"" and a nice pairing of voices in ""when the River Meets the Sea"". Adults andchildren will find this an enjoyable additon to their Christmas music collection. It's a re-release of and older vinyl album by the same title and jacket, but in a cleaner format. If youenjoy it as we have, think of giving it as gifts to friends and family!"
1,Bitter Disappointment,"I ordered this cd thinking it was the same as the title of the same name that was released in 1979. I was terribly disappointed to discover that this copy does not have three of the original recordings. Be sure to double, triple check what you order."
1,Don't get Laserlight Version - Buy the CUTOUT Version,"I loved, loved, loved this album as a child. I had in on my wish list last Christmas and put in in the CD player the minute it arrived. You can't imagine how crushed I was that this cd was missing three songs from the original album. ""Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", the sweet ""When the River meets the sea"" and the cruelest cut of all, it doesn't have ""Little St. Nick"". Don't buy it. Point your browser to the Cutout version instead, don't make the same mistake I did."
1,Very Disappointed,Your description of this title states it was released in 1979...however it does not have three songs that were on the 1979 release..don't understand and was very disappointed.
1,My favorite! BUT...,"This version is missing songs...the best ones, too! Don't buy it, look for the full version."
3,WE LOVE THIS ALBUM BUT HAVE THE FULL VERSION. NOW WHERE IS THE DVD???,"We have this CD but the full version with the missing 3 songs that are described below by the other viewers. I bought it YEARS ago. My query is...why isn't this available in DVD format?? My 4year old son saw Kermit in the Macy's Parade this year (2008) and LOVED him. So I rolled out this CD that I've had for years. He ADORES it but keeps asking me who the characters are who sing. So, when I went to look to purchase the DVD...it is NADA. COME ON!!! There is a whole new generation who is ready to PURCHASE!! PUT THIS IN DVD!!!"
5,wonderful memories,"I believe our first copy of this music was on an 8-track! We were already big fans of John Denver and this holiday collection was just wonderful. I have looked for several years for this on CD.If you want to feel happy and find the Christmas joy you may have misplaced, just put in this CD and wrap yourself in the love and warm fuzzies you're gonna feel!"
5,John Denver and the Magical Muppets,"Wow, what a great cd.I love this wonderful Christmas cd so much, that I've been searching for the vhs tape of the show that John Denver and the Muppets did together for about 15 years now. I know it is out there,because the Disney Channel has had it on the air before.One of my great joy's is christmas music, and by far this cd is the best."
1,Does BMG music ever read these?,"I too, have been searching for the complete CD of The Muppets and John Denver - A Christmas Together, with all 13 songs. We still have the LP, which my children grew up listening to. The first CDs that came out DID have all 13 songs on it, as we bought, but my son lost his.After buying another one in 2001, we noticed that even though the item number remained identical on the CD, there were 3 less songs.I have attempted to email the customer service department at BMG, but never received a reply. At least we can still play the LP when the kids are home at Christmas, but I keep hoping...."
3,saddened by the loss of my favorite song,"I have always loved this album, it has been a part of my life as long as I can remember (my parents still own the record), and I have always loved the non traditional Christmas songs that were on it. When I ordered this item for my self however I was quite saddened to find that the song When The River Meets the Sea, had been edited out. This was always my favorite and I believe that the cd should reflect the same songs as the original. Expecially since that song was the only one missing. If the cd had been complete I would have no question given a review of 5 stars."
5,A MUST HAVE,"This is by far one of the best Christmas albums ever, ever! Miss Piggy gets a little obnoxious, but you would expect no less from her. Simply the best. Nuff' said."
5,A Holiday Favorite,"This is my favorite Christmas album! Take this out every holiday season during tree trimming and gift wrapping time. Mostly classic Christmas songs with a Muppet twist with John Denver. Converted my wife into a Muppet fan with this album, needless to say it is a must for fans of The Muppet Fan Show."
5,book worm,received in great shape very good cd anyone who likes john denver or the muppets will like this cd
5,Great for the kids...,"We had this album on tape when I was a child, and now I love sharing it with my kids! It's so fun to sing along with the muppets characters."
3,Not the full album,"Buyer beware! This is the ten track version, you'll want the full thirteen track edition."
5,My favorite holiday albm of all time.,Wish I could purchase the video TV show this albm was made from. The music is very different and very holidayesque.
5,Love the muppets,"I like the muppets and John Denver. The order came quickly and I am very pleased. I especially like ""the 12 days of Christmas"""
3,This One Is Missing Songs.,"I remember watching this Christmas special on tv when I was kid. I still have the LP version. The songs on this album are a good mix of some fun songs (e.g. ""Christmas Is Coming"" with Miss Piggy), classic carols (e.g. ""Silent Night""), and happy ballads (e.g. ""A Baby Just Like You""). Unfortunately this album isn't the complete album. It only includes 10 songs instead of 13. The songs missing on this album are:""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas""""When the River Meets the Sea""""Deck the Halls"".Even though the album contains some good Christmas music, the album isn't complete. Therefore, I can't recommend getting it. Buy the version that has all the songs instead."
4,Almost perfect.....,"It is so wonderful to have this old favorite on cd, and my daughter loves it as much as I always have. But as someone else here mentioned, I do not like that it was edited and made shorter than the original. Why in the world did they not include ALL the songs? You can buy the tape cassette in some stores which has extra songs. And it's worth it. They leave out a few really *wonderful* songs on this cd which is really too bad. For that, I cannot give it five stars. If it had all the songs on it, I'd give it a thousand stars as one of the best holiday cd's ever. Fun songs, beautiful songs, and some classic songs.Also - yes, WHERE IS THE DVD??? I would love to have that!!!"
5,Great Album,"I love this CD!! Growing up my sisters and I played this record over and over every year for Christmas...however, I was sorely disappointed when I grew up and no longer had a record player and couldn't find it on CD. Then a couple years back I was able to find it and was sooo excited, except the version I have only has 10 songs. I will definitely have to get this version as it has all the original songs."
3,An incomplete nostalgia...,"I grew up listening to this album, but was disapppointed to find out that it was not the complete version that I remembered. ""Little Saint Nick"", covered by Dr. Teeth and company was gone. More importantly, ""When the River Meets the Sea"" was curiously missing. Since this song was central to ""Emmit Otter's Jug Band Christmas"", and since it seems Disney and Henson's Co. will never agree to release that soundtrack, its ommission was especially disappointing. Still, it is a good family Christmas album, with a nostalgia scale matched by few holiday albums."
4,Where is Rowlf?,"I had the Australian LP pressing of this on the record player continuously every christmas since I can remember (until the record player died)... And we had Rowlf singing ""Have yourself a merry little christmas"" accompanied by himself on the piano.It's not on this CD!! How very sad.However the CD is still very good, and I just love Miss Piggy singing ""Five Gooooooold Rings, badum dum dum"" as well as all the gang and all the favourites.I miss Rowlf - but I am glad there was a CD available of the rest."
3,Somewhat disappionted....,"because I have the orignal recording, and I noticed that on this re-release or whatever, it's missing three songs, which happen to be my favorite : ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas"", ""When the River Meets the Sea"", and ""Little St. Nick"" they are not included.This happens to be an album I've been listening to since I was a kid, and those songs not being on this cd, really disappoints me."
2,Edited Version -- NOT FULL ALBUM!,"As a child I remeber listening to this LP over and over again during the season... however, I was disappointed to learn when I put this CD in that it was not the whole album I remembered.. missing are ""Little St. Nick"", ""When the river meets the Sea"" and Rolf's great ""Have yourself a Merry Little Christmas"". I cannot recommend this CD."
1,DO NOT BUY THE Laserlight VERSION OF THIS CD!!!,"Do not buy this version of the Muppets ""Christmas Together""! Many Muppets fans, including myself, have been tricked into buying this cd thinking it was the original... when in fact it is missing 3 of the most important songs (Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, Little Saint Nick, and When the River Meets the Sea). Do not support this [cd]! If you grew up listening to this album every Chirstmas like I did - you will be very dissapointed!"
2,NOT THE REAL DEAL,"This is normally a 5 star album, but I am deducting a star for each song that was (savagely) cut from the album. I fully recommend purchasing the 13 song version of this album, not the 10 song version. Unfortunately, it is out of print and hard to find. Thus, I reccommend EBAY or HALF.COM and buy it used. It will be worth whatever extra amount of money you have to pay, just read the rest of the reviews to find that out."
2,Not the Total Album,"I recieved this CD as a gift. I was excited since I listened to this album as a child. After listing to it I realaized that there was 3 songs missing. Little Saint Nick with Animal on the drums, Have Yourself a Merry LIttle Christmas and When the River Meets the Sea. I was dissapointed with this CD. Had it not been a gift I would have not bought it myself."
5,One of Hrabal's Best!,"Total Fears takes the form of a series of letters to an American student before and during the Velvet Revolution of Czechoslovakia. It is equal parts a love story, a personal memoir, and aching commentary on the fears Hrabal felt during the Communist regime as both a writer suppressed by the regime and fueled by it. Hrabal, a man of afterthoughts, writes his letters much as he does in his other works, in streams of consciousness. He moves from one topic to the next and then beautifully intertwines them. Though this book does not follow a traditional plot, it is traditional Hrabal, and moves the reader to see the extraordinary in history, love, and the conflict every one of us faces inside. I was truly moved by the book. While I do not consider it to be at the level of Too Loud A Solitude, perhaps Hrabal's most successful work, it is one of the warmest books I have read in quite some time. I highly recommend it!"
5,THE Must Have Classic Tut Book,"Written for a curious public, this is Howard Carter's only published account of the finding of the tomb and clearing of the ""Antechamber"". It is easy for some, more than 75 years after its discovery to fault Carter for his handling of many of the objects from the tomb. Here you can read of some of the problems and his solutions first hand. Included are the photos Burton took during the clearance. Some of these are to be found nowhere else. The step by step emptying of the famous ""Painted chest"" is fascinating. You can actually see the condition of the objects deteriorate as the bottom of the box is reached."
5,Fascinating,"If you love Epyptology, you'll love this book. Written like a diary, it will keep you on the edge of your seat, waiting for what's around the corner. A must read!"
4,Good Book,This is a very interesting book. Who could do a better job then Carter at writing a book on King Tutankhamen. I only wish they could have added a few more pictures of the beautiful treasures in the tomb.
4,It's like being there!,"There are two things that make this book special: Mr. Carter's description of not only what he sees as he enters the tomb, but his emotions as well. The other special feature is that the book's pictures have been interjected within his story in close proximity to what Carter is describing at the time.Carter also makes it extremely easy to understand what he is describing by referencing specific plate numbers. This is useful when the reader is not familiar with the name of an item because it never existed in modern times.For a person who enjoys reading stories of true events, Mr. Carter has given us a gem of a book. My only wish is that Mr. Carter had available to him at the time the technology of color film. His descriptions of what he sees and the stiking colors he witnessed in the tomb leave one yearning for color prints."
4,Great Challenge.,"This is a great book. The daily challenges are difficult, but in the end its worth it. There are many unexpected twists, but once you commit, you don't quit. Justin wrote this book to be very raw, so don't take stuff the wrong way. Overall, a great buy."
3,Not what I expected,"I purchased the book because of it's title, but found it took me in a direction I didn't expect. Although it is probably based on a real life issue, it has its humor. I can truly say its a reading I would have never picked up on my own. All in all it was entertaining."
3,Hoping for better ending.,Overall this book was ok. It was neither great nor the worse book I have ever read. It had its moment. I think this story had lots of potential but it left me wanting more. It was not a difficult read but I found it to be too predictable. Crazy is as crazy does. I figured the ending before I got to it. I was a bit disappointed though. I expected more out of Julian Payne and at times he seemed a bit nave to be a player. This book will keep you turning the pages until the end.
3,Definitely Interesting,"This is my first book by MB, it wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was definitely interesting enough to keep me turning the pages. To me that's all that really matters. I agree with some of the other reviewers he should have had a better proofreader. Also, I think he could have done a better job with developing the chracters. I can't believe Julian was so simple when it came to Oliva, I mean come on after the first encounter you best believe I would have caught on much quicker as to what a crazy and deranged person Oliva truly was. Aside from this the book will keep you turning the pages."
2,Use Your Library Card,"Radio talk show host, Julian, has a one-night stand with a woman who assures him that what happens in Chicago will stay in Chicago. Well, you can tell by the cover of the book how this is gonna play out.Typical book of this genre. Nothing special here. Dialogue heavy and a thin plot. Easy read, though. Would work on the beach, on a plane, or in a waiting room."
2,Play Misty for Me -- Revisited,"Baisden must've liked the radio personality/stalker Clint Eastwood movie so much that he re-wrote it almost scene for scene. Hated his poetry-if someone sent me poetry like that, I'd laugh him out of town. And - if I saw ""brotha"" and ""sista"" one more time!!! AND I can't believe he referred to another of his books (The Maintenance Man) in the storyline of this book over and over! I think Blaisden is a lot like Julian, both are just too much in love with themselves!"
3,God's gift to women,"I read ""GOD'S GIFT"" and I must say I was unimpressed. I expected more development with certain characters and subplots. The fact that Julian encountered a woman who was mentally unstable was quite believable. What was however unbelievable was the fact that he took so much of her mess never seeking assistance from law enforcement. Overall the book was somewhat interesting yet predictable at times. In my opinion, this was not Michael Baisden's best work, but a decent read none-the-less.Bottom line, the message in this book is very clear. Be careful who you take home. When emotions begin to run high, it can be a recipe for disaster."
5,another great book,"gods gift to women is a story about the mistakes that others make that a person has to pay the price for. julian is a hard working good looking man who is also a single parent raising his 10 year old daugter. well one nite he met this beautiful woman named olivia brown.they slept together and the feelings were mutual but this olivia is psycho and she wants julian no matter what it takes to get his attention,if it means kidknapping, killing, and stalking by all means necessary. i cant go into details because it will give the book away, but i feel that its a great novel that will keep you on your toes, and when you read it, it definitly looks like it can be a movie"
5,Off the Chains!!!!,"This book is one of Mr. Baisden's best works. Since I've only read the Maintenance Man series, I didn't think I would be able to get into this book. HOWEVER, I was DEAD wrong!!! This book, in my opinion, was a fantastic read. I think there should be a Book II, who knows, maybe the nut case (Olivia) isn't really dead.....LOL!"
5,God's Gift to Women,"Another great book by Michael Baisden. The story is full of laughs and inspiration. Something to think about. Note to the fellas: If you see a beautiful lady in a red dress, run like HELL! because she might be crazy!! Loved this book..Happy reading."
3,Pretty good..,"WEAK POINTS: The plot was very predictable. The parts about Terri went from being realistic to flat-out corny and read more like a romance novel would. I was surprised they didn't run to each other with the wind blowing (but they were in Texas, I guess Chicago would've worked better for that scene). The poetry was pitiful.STRONG POINTS: I think Michael Baisden would be a fun person to hang around with because the sometimes-cynical humor mixed with most-of-the-time laugh out loud humor would keep me entertained. A few characters were edgy, some bold, and some were just enjoyable to meet (I liked Eddie and Sam ""West-siiiiiide""). The theme of the story is strong and I really do appreciate it. I hope a lot of brothas read this. The dialogue made the story fun and the knowledge of scenery made him look experienced.Overall, a pretty good read."
1,DID NOT LIKE,I did not like this book. It started off slow and gets even slower in the middle. It was a good story line though. Just was not written well.
5,Michael Baisden keeps getting better and better,"This book Was the bomb!!. A real page turner, I have read every one of Michael Baisden books, and he gets better and better, with each book. I read this book in 3 days. I could not put it down... the character Olivia really blew my mind,moving across the country for a man!.I also gave it to my single friends, so they can realize one night of passion can lead to a lifetime of pain.... good job Michael."
3,God's Gift to Women,"I just finished reading the book--it was fast paced and a quick read. I agree with most of the reviews i.e. lack of character development, unrealistic behavior of the characters and a predictable story line. It reminded me of the movie, Thin Line Between Love and Hate. I could not believe how stupid he made Eddie, his best friend in the story. I still think that his first book, Why Men Cheat, was his best."
4,GREAT BOOK FULL OF DRAMA,I JUST HAVE TO SAY I LOVED THIS BOOK... I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN THAT OLIVIA CHARACTER WAS OFF THE HOOK.IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK BUY THIS ONE!.
3,God's gift to women,"I read ""GOD'S GIFT"" and I must say I was unimpressed. I expected more development of certain characters and subplots. The fact that Julian encountered a woman who was mentally unstable was quite believable. What was however unbelievable was the fact that he took so much of her mess never seeking assistance from law enforcement. Overall the book was somewhat interesting yet predictable at times.

When emotions begin to run high, it can be a recipe for disaster."
2,Not As Good As His Other Books,I just couldn't get into this book. Not as good as his other two. The antics of the woman stalking him just didn't draw you in. I wasn't impressed.
4,"""God's Gift To Women""",The book is very interesting.A bit predictable by how the first couple of chapters were written but none the less still a good book.The characters were nice and were described in deep detail.The story was deep and action packed after the first beginning of the end.I liked the way the main character Julian Payne kept straight to the point and spoke his mind with whoever he talked to no matter who it was.Julian Payne was a single father who lived in Houston but was involved with a woman that would change his life for ever.
5,"Steph, Southwest Philly","This was a real page turner, I could not put it down. EXCELLENT BOOK AGAIN BY ONE OF MY FAVORITE AUTHORS."
3,Better luck next time,This book was very predictable. I thought it was going to be off the hook but was sadly mistaken. I took this book right back...
1,Awful,"This book is filled with incorrect spelling, and misuse of punctuation. I don't know how anyone was able to tolerate it. It could have been written by a grade schooler. The poor use of language is surprising. Why didn't Mr. Baisden hire a decent editor? The errors were too much of a distraction to even concentrate on the characters, or so called plot. I'll pass on his future work."
1,I HOPE THIS IS A PHASE,"THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT AND ONLY BECAUSE I SPENT MY OWN MONEY FOR IT. I LOVE HIS OTHER BOOKS AND EVEN WENT TO SEE THE PLAY FOR ""MEN CRY IN THE DARK"". I TRULY BELIEVE SOMEONE ELSE WROTE THIS BOOK AND PAID MR. BAISDEN TO PUT HIS NAME ON IT. UGH!"
1,This book is nothing more than movie plagarism!!,"This book is a ghetto combination of 2 good movies, Michael Douglas' Fatal Attraction and Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me. What kept nagging me was the arrest/fight scene between the obsessed female and the police. I read it over and over, trying to remember where else I had heard or read this confrontation. Again, I figured it out!! It is the article which appeared in a certain prominent African-American (small-sized) magazine when Lionel Ritchie's first wife (Brenda, I think) first found out he was cheating on her.Mr. Baisden, you should be ashamed of yourself!! You need to improve your writing skills and research your subject matter before you ever write another book!"
1,Thumbs Down!!,"Lets see where I could possibly start with this one. Okay, let me just give it to you guys straight. Predictable plot, poorly written, and under developed characters. Lucky for me I borrowed this one from a friend. I found myself becoming greatly aggravated with the author with each page that I turned. There was a point where even the description of the ...character changed. ... So simply put. I would leave this one in [web] inventory. Check it out at the library, heck borrow it from a friend. To spend money on this one will be a great loss."
1,Psychotic Woman... same ole story,"I gave the book 1 star simply because it's probably Mr. Baisden's best written book out of all the ones I've read.However, I suppose I'm dissapointed in the development of the charactors. It may have been better if we hadn't found out what happens to him in the beginning of the book and then have to read through all of the drama, and poor decisions he makes to get there.I do think it's good to get a male perspective in fiction, however it's scary that his protaganist Dr. Terri seems to have almost as many issues as his antagonist Olivia.I'd like to see him use his style on more developed characters and stories and less on stereotypical drama.I only read this one for a book club."
4,Fresh but predictable,"Brother Baisde has don it again, this book is a winner. The chactors were fresh and likeable. Even though the story is not new and befor you finshed you know what was going to happend you wanted to read it through. I likr the different twist he had put on the old theme of there is a thin line between love and hate. I think this would make a great movie for TV or the big screen."
5,MUST READ!,This book was totally awesome. I am an avid reader and this book was so good. I took it everywhere I went. I read it at every stop light and even into the bank to read while I was in line. I enjoy all of Michael Baisden's books and I have yet to be disappointed. It was extremely funny but it dealt with extremely serious issues also. It is very refreshing to view things from a man's point a view and I finished it in 2 days only because I had to work and go to sleep. I am looking forward to reading many many more books from Michael Baisden and I would recommend it to anybody to read.
5,They are something else!,"I love this song. It reminds me of my boy friend. He called and requested this song for me. Justin has the kind of voice that tuches your life, he knows how to get your atention, and he KNOWS girls by the millions. Chris, (skunk man), is trying to be himself. I can see it in his eyes and in his moves. J.C. is sweet. I can see it in his style and in his face. Lance is as plane as it gets. While the other guys are trying to do the style thing, with the baggy pants and stuff, he choses to be himself. He also has a (to die for) smile. Joey has got the bodd. He's 100% all guy! I disagree when they say that they are trying to be the Back Street Boys. They are Rare, and ginuine. If they are trying to be anyone, it's the New Kids On The Block. Think about that for a while. The New Kids where, ""All That!"""
2,They are the little version of Back Street Boys,"my vewiew of them is not all that good. even though i do like them a little bit. i think that they can write there own songs and stop copping tha back street boys. Thats how they make there money is by taking there songs. dont take this personal, this is my oppion"
1,Bait and Switch!!!!,"I bought the more expensive version of Julius Caesar for the Kindle because the cover art shows the ""Shakespeare Made Easy"" version. This is just the public domain play that I could have gotten for free from Project Gutenberg. Note -- rating should be zero stars, but it won't let me leave it blank."
1,Julius Caesar CD,I am disappointed with the CD they are scratched or something and i can 't use them in my classroom. I have wasted my money. i dont know if I will order from here again.
4,Ceasar was powerful and then lost his power.,"Ceasar,waas a very powerful man in his day and time. Mark Antony was a good guy with a bad reputation. Ceasar said, ""Forget not in your speed, Antonius, To Touch Calpurina; for our elders say The barren, touched in this holy chase, Shake off their sterile curse."""
1,Interesting history but poor resolution,"Having read much historically about the the Roman emperors, I was very excited to be reading JULIUS CAESAR. It was interesting at first to compare the characters of the play to the same names we read about in history books. I felt that this is one of Shakespeare's most difficult books to interpret in today's language. Even though this edition does have extensive foot (or in this book, side) notes, the reading process was confusing having to look back in forth. If you are just reading this play to read some Shakespeare, try another less difficult Shakespeare work, like A COMEDY OF ERRORS. Thsi is much easier to understand, and for beginners, you will probably enjoy it more. But if you are a beginner looking for a tragedy, try ROMEO and JULIET. While the language can be confusing at time, this classic story should really be read by all."
4,The Tragedy of Julius Ceasar - Kindle,"I purchased this Kindle edition as a preparation for the audio drama version. Although there are no commentaries in this edition, the price is free since volunteers provided the version for Kindle. For background information on the play and its writing, I go to Wikipedia.."
4,Exciting and Fun to Read,"Next to ""Macbeth,"" this is Shakespeare's most violent and brutal play. It's also very exciting and easy to understand. The only thing that scares me more than Banquo's ghost from ""Macbeth"" is the horrible thought of a person choking on hot coals."
5,"Once again, morality vs. politics","This superb play by Shakespeare somehow reminded me of Antigona, the first play which directly examined the always complex interplay and usual confrontation between political reason and moral reason. This play is an excellent account of the immediately previous and subsequent days of Julius Caesar's assasination by Brutus, his best friend, and other conspirators. Brutus is persuaded by the resentful Cassius that Caesar has betrayed Rome by abandoning the Republic and turning to Dictatorship. Brutus gets to be convinced that, in order to save the Republic, Caesar must be killed. This puts him in a great dilemma, for he loves Caesar and he's his closest friend. Here we see in an acute form the way in which political power gets in conflict with morality and feelings. Friendship, power and betrayal are the basic subjects of this excellent piece of work."
1,Deplorable (...),"A further proof of the dumbing down of our society are this entire series. It is a shame and a disgrace that ever such as these were needed. For those who can't follow the text I suggest you get the Folger series. The only real problem with understanding Shakespeare would be the ancronistic words. The Folger series, in fact most editions of Shakespeare, provide notes explaining those words. Shakespeare is poetry. Changing the words to ""modern"" english is as futile as rewriting Robert Frost. It is pathetic."
2,Lithuanina songs/dances,Skips in many places. Not like the vinyl version. I was expecting more than what we got. would not buy again from this site
3,"Fun, but not a story at all.","I was a little disappointed with this book. It was recommended to me and we love Suess, however I thought there would be a bit of a story to it, which there isn't. Also, while the quizzes are funny the first time, it's not really the kind of book you come back to as you already know the answers after the first time you read it. I would recommend this as a library book versus buying it to keep."
4,Like no other Cagney film you have seen!,I found this DVD by accident and took a chance. You have to be willing to stay with it as the production is somewhat overwhelming as it appears that the story was originally intended for the stage - and that is how it is played. But the characterizations that Cageny encounters and orchestrates are mesmerizing. You will never look at Cagney quite the same way again.
3,Big Cagney fan,"I will purchase any movie that has James Cagney as a cast member. This movie, not really good, but they do the best they can."
5,good guide,"great strategy guide, loved it and it was very helpful, especially finding some of the harder side quests and items and stuff, loved it and suggest it for xenosaga players."
2,Typical Brady product,"This guide is decent enough, I suppose.. until you get to the part with the hard boss, where the guide utterly fails to mention that 1. the boss has two specific elemental attacks, both of which the party could have been protected against and 2. the boss has INSTANT KO attacks, which can't be protected against but really, would have been nice to know ahead of time. This is absolutely typical of Brady--a guide which is good to a point. Past that point, you'd better just save a lot and keep your fingers crossed. Next time, I think I'll stick with web guides--at least they have an excuse for being amateurish efforts."
5,"Before there was Dylan, Bragg or Thompson, there was MacColl","Here is MacColl unfettered by the sapiness of '60s folk music that sent the likes of Bob Dylan running for the dark side. Though you might not know it, MacColl had a huge influence on Dylan, Billy Bragg, not to mention more traditionally oriented artists like Richard Thompson, Mick Hanley, Andy M. Stewart and Dick Gaughin. Timeless stuff here, fetched from most of MacColl's recordings, making it a representative collection of the many themes of MacColl's career. You will find the best renditions of historical songs as well as radical, labor-politics influenced songs. Of the latter, ""Dirty Old Town"" is probably the best known."
3,I liked this better than Westworld,"[...]When I was a kid I enjoyed Futureworld much more than Westworld, mainly because I liked the coolness of the robots in Futureworld (whereas in Westworld the robots were all too human). Clark in particular left a favorable impression on me.I think the story in Futureworld is more enjoyable than Westworld, because it revolves around world domination conspiracies. Westworld is just silly paranois about robots, whereas Futureworld is about robots being used by humans to evil purposes. Unfortunately Futureworld is poorly produced as a lot of potentially exciting scenes, like the fighting between the real and fake humans, are never fully developed, leaving the impression that the film was hastily put together.Still, after 30 years and having been largely forgotten, this film continues to be an enjoyable sci-fi film."
3,The widescreen R2 Spanish DVD is cut,"Films buffs will want to know that the Spanish R2 'Mundo Futuro' DVD is missing footage. There are four cuts totaling 2.5 minutes of missing footage:1. The pre-credit sequence is missing.2. Some dialoge during the press invite, round table scene.3. When Peter Fonda explores the remains of Westworld.4. Dialogue at the very end.Until a better version is released, your best bet is to pick up the R2 UK full frame edition which includes all of the above cuts."
1,One of the Worst Sequels of alll time!!,"It was very much anticipated after the success of ""Westworld"" that this movie would be just as good as the original. Sorry to say that it doesn't do any good! Yul Brenner is only in this movie for about 2 minutes, and that's in a dream sequence!! Don't waste your time on purchasing or watching this retread! It's a waste of time and money!!"
1,BAD TAPE FROM GOODTIMES,"The VHS tape I received from two different vendors was very bad in both cases. This tape from Goodtimes appears to be about a third generation copy. The label on the tape just has a place to write in the movie name instead of being preprinted like the better movies I have received. The picture quality is grainy with sparkles around the edges and a flatness to peoples faces.I tried a different vendor who said theirs was from Warner Home Video, but when the tape came it was also a Goodtimes video. Now I will be eating the shipping charges to send it back.I suggest that everyone avoid anything made by Goodtimes and that .......... and any other vendors avoid them, too."
2,Moribund sequel devoid of inspiration,"The Bottom Line:Westworld isn't one of the greatest movies ever made but it gives the viewer a sense of vicarious pleasure and intrigue through the world of Delos, not to mention a riveting chase sequence near the end; by contrast, Futureworld is lacking in almost anything interesting and has long, long sequences in which people stand around and talk without anything interesting to say.2/4"
3,Mild sci-fi for its time.,"Futureworld is a good mild sci-fi movie for its time. I am NOT a fan of CGI so I like movies that do not use CGI. The movie is so much more realistic when costumes/models and animatronics are used. Futureworld is a good movie to have to add to your collection, but it is not as good as Westworld. I have seen much worse movies, some made recently. I had Futurworld on VHS for a long time as was glad to finally see it released on DVD."
2,Not having Goodtimes with Goodtimes Home Video,"FUTUREWORLD is really not a bad follow-up to WESTWORLD, but Goodtimes Home Video makes viewing this film a very bad-time. The only thing good about it is seeing Yul Brynner back if this is the only way we can get to see him. He was very good if only for a short segment in this film. Hard to recommend this version at all."
1,Usual Leftist Prejudices Impersonating Ideas,"This book is the usual leftist self-parody. To quote Shaw, ""This is not a book one should put down lightly. It should be thrown with great force."""
4,charles review on its good to be king sometimes,this book is a great book if u want to fin out how a wrestlers life is. Jerry (the king lawler) has a lot to talk about in this book he talks about his divorce in memphis. the main reason why his wife broke up wit him. jerrys life is matched up to the title its good to be king sometmes. His life is great because of his sports entertainment job as the comentator with jr his ife is great sometimes. that is my reaviewcharles fowlkes
4,"Great Memphis history, sad ending","I wasn't sure what to expect with this one, compared to the hype with other recent WWE releases. I was pleasantly surprised, though.Lawler gives us his take on an amazing career, without overly taking credit for inventing the entire business the way others did (coughcoughHogancoughPiper). If you were a fan of some of his wild Memphis angles, you'll love the description he gives here, not to mention the backstory of how Jimmy Hart, Kamala, Andy Kaufman and others got their starts.The sad part of it comes towards the end where he talks about losing Stacy and how he tries to find a woman, any woman to replace her, albeit just for outward appearances. He comes across as a real person, and not the Memphis superhero some may expect, and that's true throughout the book.Not required reading the way Mick Foley's books are, but definitely not a bad choice."
2,Painfully written; a disappointment,"I enjoy Jerry Lawler as a tv commentator on wrestling... his sophomoric character can add to the circus atmosphere. But not hundreds of pages of it. Too many references to his high school buddies. Cornball humor is one thing, but this is cheeseball. What you won't find is much depth on the history of Memphis wrestling. A few ""early days"" anecdotes and the Andy Kaufman rehash. Sorry, Jerry, even that's not fresh. And the chapters that go on and on about his last wife are simply an embarrassment. It's written on a 15 year-old level because, frankly, he hasn't grown up at all. I hoped for a lot more."
3,"""It's Good To Be The King"" Review","Jerry ""The King"" Lawler joins the ever-growing list of wrestlers who have decided to write an autobiography on their life in and out of the ring. ""It's Good To Be The King... Sometimes"" chronicles Lawler's life from his days as the self-proclaimed ""King"" of the Memphis territories to his current career as a commentator on the WWE's Monday Night RAW broadcasts. While I didn't find this book to be in the same leauge as some of the others (particulary those written by Mick Foley), it is a good read and covers some interesting topics like Lawler's departure from the WWF due to his wife's release, his many problems with females including his most recent wife, Stacy leaving him, and many other intruiging stories. If nothing else, ""Good To Be King"" makes for an entertaining read."
4,Mostly of interest to collectors,"This book was written by Frederick B. Patterson, son of NCR founder John Henry Patterson (not the J.H. Patterson of Maneaters of Tsavo fame). While the prose are not exceptional it is a rarely seen example of the African Safari journals that were so popular in the early 20th Century. It is also notable for its high quality photographs. It includes photos of and references to famous professional hunter Denys Finch-Hatten who guided the Safari and became famous as a main character in Karen Blixen's book (and subsequent movie) Out of Africa."
5,This saved me from junking my laptop,"When my USB board burned out I thought I could no longer use the laptop. Not even knowing if anything like this BUSlink USB adapter existed, I did a search and found it at Amazon. It works exactly as advertised, replacing my original USB ports. Most of the time I have four peripherals plugged in at the same time. A Godsend!"
1,stay away from this thing,"I got this USB 2.0 card and tried with my card reader and mp3 player. It sees the drives but as soon as you want to copy file to the drive it gives write delay error and corrupt your storage device. I had to format my mp3 player and lost my data. It does not matter whether you do it with powered or not, the result is same. I would say stay away from this junk"
1,4 port usb 2.0 installed,"I have a hp portable bought in the spring of 2002 with a 1.3 ghz processor and a 30 gig hard drive that came with xp.I bought the 4-port usb adapter expecting the extra ports to be a tight fit.It turns out the lid (which is wider than the main body) hits the top of the connectors on the card. To close the lid the card has to be pulled out.The CD that came with the package to install the drivers didn't work. It tried to install, but gave a message that the install failed.According to the directions, you need to get SP1 (or maybe its driver). The directions also suggest getting the latest drivers from the buslink web site. I did and that driver installed just fine.I have only tried a couple of devices (a 1 gig lexor media which loaded 900 megabytes in 3 minutes. And a WD 120 gig usb harddrive which I looked at some pictures.) Neither device required adding drivers."
5,Sports Night is amazing,This show is another one of Aaron Sorkin's works with witty banter and fast paced quips inter-spaced with touching poignant dialogue. It has well set-up and emotionally evolving cast of characters that flesh out this world perfectly. I recommend this as a great show with light and intelligent humor.
4,Great entertainment on your Kindle when traveling,Doesn't take many brain cells to absorb. Great for travel when you have a few minutes to burn and are tired of reading.
3,"Gives the same weight loss tips as seen on ""Oprah""","Although I enjoy hearing and reading Bob Greene's books, there was nothing new in this one. Most of the pertinent information has already been heard on ""Oprah"" or in his previous material.Though the recipes sounded delightful, they were not practical or convenient. Several ingredients would require many stops at specialty stores."
1,Bob Greene,"Have ALL his books and I would not recommend. His system may work for Oprah, but not a good direction for me"
5,Wow!,This is a knock-yer-socks-off collection of music featuring an amazing female vocalist and several instrumental pieces. Music doesn't get much spicier or much better than this! Listen to the samples and hear how great this album is for yourself!!!!
5,Perfect Pizzelles,"I recently purchased this iron because I was tired of paying what the grocery store wanted for them. I love it. I am able to make ice cream cones, bowls, and plain old cookies. I put off buying this iron for a long time because I did not want another useless appliance in my house. I purchased this from Amazon as a refurbished piece and it works perfectly. I use it at least once a week, if not for myself for my young son who loves them too! It has an adjustable iron so that you get the perfect cookie each time according to what you want. The recipes are great also.It comes with a recipe book, spoon and wooden turning tool for making cones or rolled cookies. Oh! The cookie iron has a flower on"
1,candy,I was very dissapointed in the product. I had to throw it away because it was old. Never again will I order candy on line.
3,Mostly of Historical Interest,"In 1940-41, it looked like Hitler might invade Britain. Tom Wintringham, the author of this little book, was instrumental in forming the Home Guard, as he'd been a Communist volunteer in the Spanish Civil War. In NEW WAYS OF WAR, he gives some information about fighting and fortification that would be of use to British resistance fighters.Unfortunately, because Wintringham was a commie, he spent far more time bashing Britain for the sin of being capitalist than in outlining how to resist invaders. So while some of the pro-communist propaganda and Spanish Civil War stuff is historically interesting, the book is useful more for what it tells us about Britain in 1940 than it is for showing civilians how to fight."
3,"Old, still could be a must for statisticians, not so much for others","This book is pretty extensive, however, you can tell it was published a long time ago when it calls the F-test a ""new"" thing in statistics. I would only recommend it to people who are statisticians or in the process of becoming one. People who are just taking one statistics course, or perhaps want to learn for their own research need to find something more user friendly."
5,Excellent book,I found the writing clear and easy to follow. I recommend this book to anyone looking for an excellent introducory text in statistics.
4,Pledge allegiance to the funk,"This funk fiesta can't quite reach ecstatic jamming heights ala Headhunters, though still contains enough meaty grooves to secure its status as a classic spin."
5,still groovin,one nation has been sampled to death this whole cd rocks too bad clinton could'nt rekidle his flame in the 90's but still the funk ain't dead yet george goes into phrases galore on pe squad with the last phrase being fried ice cream is a reality if you don't knpw what fried ice cream is it's cooked up cocaine someone singing backup if i could i'd love you more than powder i could be wrong a weird cut which is normal for george and the true funkateers and mike hampton rocks
3,damn,"A good album .. not a great album. The groove comes and goes and there exists a certain possiblility that this record was mixed in the studio under altered states of minds. Go figure. That being said, Lunchmeataphobia, originally a 45 that was included inside with the full size vinyl, should be listened to under the most maximum, bigalicious, giganto speaker system you can find, turned past 11. Yipes. Guitarama Mama!! WooooHoooo!! Still LOVE this song real loud!"
4,My music,"I am from the era when music was GREAT and everyone who performed it had a distinct sound. Now it's all puff and fluff. So, to re-introduce myself to those great albums makes me very happy."
3,a good intro,This is a good introduction to facial care and cosmetic surgery. Dr. Irwin writes plainly and tells you the pros and cons of each teatment and what could go wrong. She also gives brand name suggestions of products to use.
3,OK,These baseball pants are ok. Was looking for the knicker style because my son prefers the Ian Kinsler look. The build looks reasonable from a stitching standpoint but I wouldn't go so far as to call them premium. The fabric is not all that thick and the knees are not reinforced so I expect that they will tear pretty quickly under my son's regular use.Not as good as the adidas brand that we got at the local sporting goods store and cut shorter. It's just difficult to find the shorter leg baseball pant for kids. Seems that the entire market has total sold out to the flat bill ball cap and pajama bottom pant look.
5,Brit Flick!!!,"Finally a great action movie set in England, and not by Guy Ritchie!!The 51st State, although no masterpiece, is a fantastic way to spend 90 minutes - violence, comedy, a little sex and a lot of Sam Jackson and it's set in the UK.America - at last you can see that it's not just provincial towns, cups of tea and Hugh Grant sound a likes this side of the atlantic.The 51st state - go see it!"
4,Fast paced movie.,"S. Jackson looks good in a kilt.Robert Carlyle had some fun with his character.The story was average, but it had plenty of action and some comedy."
3,Oddly I liked this movie...,"I'm not one for drug-related movies, but I had to check this one out when learning Paul Barber (aka ""Horse"" from ""The Full Monty"") starred in the movie. His part is sadly short, but comical. The language is a bit rough, but it fits well with the movie. Jackson did a good job in this, I believe, being the kind of movie it was. Give it a watch and see what you think."
4,Elmo's In The House!,"Not bad. This ultra-violent and ultra-profane action comedy does provide quite a good dose of laughs, thrills and golf. I was shocked when this film was yanked from the local theaters after only one week of playing; so when I saw it on the shelf at the video store, I grabbed it as quickly as I could. I was quite pleased with the result. The film plays out much like a Guy Ritchie-Quentin Tarantino crime caper with the music and editing of a John Woo Hong Kong superaction film. Highly entertaining and much better than I ever expected. Although the witty dialogue helps beef up the shoddy plot lines, it's Jackson's presence that gives this film its credibility. Samuel L. Jackson is, and continues to be, one of the greatest actors in our generation...and its because he carries movies like this one. You gotta love a movie where Jackson's character is one part Mace Windu, one part Jules Winfield and one part Tiger Woods."
1,Formula Movie,"Join two cool, hip stars like Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Carlyle, add a bland and oh-so-edgy direction, a couple of jokes and visual effects. Then, put a stylish, intrusive soundtrack, lots of f-words, and naturally some sex and drugs. Oh, and a guy who uses a kilt, just to make it a bit more witty. That should make for the absence of an interesting plot, who cares anyway? This is a ""Snatch"" wannabe (and even that movie wasn`t terrific by any means) that doesn`t quite work. Disposable."
1,"SAMUEL JACKSON, A PHARMACOLOGICAL GENIUS. YEAH! SURE!","TALKING ABOUT A MISSCAST. SAMUEL JACKSON CAN PORTRAY A HITMAN, A PIMP OR A THIEF, BUT A PHARMACOLOGICAL GENIUS, YEAH, RIGHT!"
1,0 Stars - This movie is awful!,"I only wish that I could give this lousy piece of crap 0 stars. The plot is disjointed at best. Meatloaf as a villain is a joke. The actors are boring and lack charisma. The story takes far too long to unfold, so for the first 30 minutes you don't know what you're watching. The ending is just plain dumb. Samuel Jackson should be ashamed of himself."
3,Formula 51,"A qiute good offbeat film that unfortunately misses the mark.For a start a large number of Americans will not get the irony of the film. Looking at the film in retrospect now, you have to be English to understand some of the humour . Also to our transatlantic cousins, there are other cities in The UK after London!The superb Samuel L Jackson is playing a toned down caricuture of Samuel L Jackson for us tamer brits; ha ha.However I do enjoy this film and seeing Jackson trading insults with assorted British tv actors who ( lets be honest )are not going to set Hollywood alight. With the exeption of Robert Carlyle plays a great comical/cynical sidekick who always delivers in his peformances.It is also refreshing having a British action film, not wussy period dramas or crappy romantic comedies starring the antichrist Hugh Grant!"
3,I actually love it,didn't think it would be anything really not Sammy best bet hey i love his sence of humor in movies always funny....
3,lightning paced testosterone fueled action comedy,"If you like movies like ""Snatch"" and ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,"" you should love ""Formula 51. Multiple sets of bad guys chasing after the secret drug formula in Samuel L. Jackson's head. The story takes off quick and only slows down for a brief, tacked on romantic subplot with two of the supporting characters. Don't forget to pause your dvd player if the phone rings or you'll miss a good chunk of the action. Samuel L. Jackson is so cool in this flick, that the kilt(which isn't explained until the final credits roll) adds to his manliness."
2,Not one of Jackson's Better Formulas,"Comparing this movie to those of Tarantino and Monte Python give Formula 51 too much credit. ""Tarantino on the Thames"" this is not. Beyond Samuel Jackson, the only saving grace of this movie is the sexy assassin played by Emily Mortimer. An almost unrecognizable Meatloaf (yes.. the rock singer) also has a small part but adds little to this formula.The plot relies on a very odd and offbeat offering of comedic and at times graphic violence. The plot is old and worn out but the movie however, invokes a few laughs. In many parts you will ask yourself, ""what the hell was that all about?"".If you like Samuel Jackson you may like it. Be warned however: Formula 51 is definitely NOT one of his best. This is rental entertainment at most."
3,Not Bad!,"You have to get use to the style of this movie for a while after it begins. It was not what I expected, but was entertaining and certainly unique."
2,Mixed FORMULA.,"If you like movies to be loud, obnoxious, and filmed in a manic style that's reminicient of an MTV video, then FORMULA 51 is for you. It seems to me when a movie has numerous interludes of a character standing still, staring at the camera whilst the latest punk/heavy metal/rap song is booming that time needs to be filled due to lack of story. This flick was simply okay, I have to admit I turned it off at the one hour mark because it was kind of dumb. Trying to be different and stylish doesn't make a movie cool, the coolest movies are different and stylish because they aren't trying to be. If you like gritty TARENTINOesque films watch PULP FICTION again instead and be rewarded with a better SAM JACKSON performance and a movie thats light years ahead in coolness over this loud mess."
2,"Clearly Worships its Idols, but Can't Hope to Match Them","Bearing a wealth of guns, drugs, quirky characters and fiery chase scenes, this desperately wants to be a cool, slick, suave black comedy in the same vein as Pulp Fiction or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. With none of the panache, authenticity, or cornerstone performances that made its forefathers into modern classics, though, it comes off as a weak, uncertain impersonation instead. The plot plays it loose and loopy, with characters losing sight of their own motivations between set changes, and becomes especially doublecross-happy as the credits near. Samuel L. Jackson plays the only part of note, as nothing more than his standard blue-lipped hardass, while Emily Mortimer is thoroughly unconvincing as a cold-blooded killer and Meat Loaf occupies the bizarre role of a drug-dealing Macguffin who constantly speaks in the third-person. Forgettable, shallow and bland."
3,Interesting Film,"Yeah, it's tough to buy Samuel Jackson as a world-class PhD biochemist. His vocabulary is very street, jive, non-college educated. If you watch enough Samuel Jackson films, you quickly get the idea that he writes his own dialog to fit his actual persona -- it doesn't matter who his character is, or level of education -- he's either jive, or predictable (e.g. the film ""Basic"" -- he's done that character in several films too).But, the plot of the film is that he invented a drug that will get all the kids high without bad side effects, and is super cheap to produce. It quickly becomes an interesting action film with a deadly hit woman, who alternates between trying to kill her ex-boyfriend and trying to reconcile with him.Lots of shootouts and blood and explosions.And a surprise ending."
3,"""Formula 51,"" or quality garbage","""Formula 51,"" they say, is a film that falls into that ""love it or hate it"" variety. I can see some truth in this common notion, but I myself am neither thrilled nor irked by the movie. Like a drug, this film's highs don't come without grating lows. For instance, the cast is superb (putting Sam Jackson and Robert Carlyle together was ingenious), but the plot is incoherent. I suppose an incoherent plot can be ignored in a movie as shamelessly comical as this one, but the fact that the best stuff is sandwhiched between a laim first and final act is harder to overlook. On top of that, ""Formula 51"" evokes choppier editing, flashier glitz, and more distracting tunes than an MTV music video. In the end, I just found myself too enthralled by a second act which never lead to a satisfying conclusion."
3,"Enjoyable, but don't expect too much","This film does take a lot from Guy Ritchie's style, but it's not exactly the same. It also reminds me of ""True Romance"". I think this movie also goes a little bit more towards ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"". The basic story is the staging of a drugdeal for the formula of a superdrug. This keeps going wrong due to all the schemes the main characters are involved in. I found this an amusing film. Don't expect anything truly original, but there certainly are memorable performances and characters. If you like something that's a bit off the wall with a lot of action go see his. Don't expect it to be the next great thing though."
5,Great Intro,"This book is simply great. Lots of historic pictures, and an easy to read and well researched text. Great book and I'll be looking up other books by the same author."
3,I prefer Odetta the folksinger,"If you own the Essential Odetta you do not need this one. The Essential is the full version of her glorious live performance; on this we have 8 cuts from that CD, and not necessarily the best ones.The other studio work ranges from pretty good to wonderful, but it is only 9 cuts. Odetta is a breathtaking performer who too often allows herself to perform second-rate material. With the best stuff, she's unbeatable. Saro Jane is a favorite song of mine; she is just fantastic on that one. And her performance of Woody's Rambling Round Your City is a winner. But I find her Battle Hymn rather dated, and the backup chorus by Milt Okun suffers from the same flaws the backup chorus on the coeval Cisco Houston LP does. Cool Water also fails.And personally, the final four performances fail to make my cut. All performed much better by others, all sounding contrived and obligatory, all very much uninteresting to me."
1,overpriced,The description was kind of misleading. I definitely thought I was getting more than one tube. $6.49 SALE price for this was outrageous.
3,No way it's worth $47!!,"Bought this as a gift. I'm sure these little packs are nice to have one handy while traveling, or whatever. But people should be aware these little tubs are way smaller than ""normal"" play-doh tubs. There's no way I'd ever pay $47 (the supposed ""retail"" price) for this pack. It's worth about what I paid for it--$6.93."
4,A hardware Geek special,"This is not the usual USB external floppy drive, it is not slim and, most important, it is not a tight-integrated, built-to-be USB drive. This has a massive case containing a standard-design internal 3.5 inch drive, mounted to an interface board with a floppy controller and USB interface on it - I cracked the case and started swapping my big stack of ""might be usable"" old drives through the unit - If you also are a hardware hacking geek, you will love this for it's test-bench functionality. Test and align internal floppies without having to open your CPU case or even re-boot when changing drives."
