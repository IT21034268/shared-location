2,Should have let them stand alone...,Maybe it was an impossible task to cover SOIA's music...maybe they were just the wrong groups to try. Most insulting was the cover of Just Look Around! How do you do that to that song and feel good about it? A person unfamiliar with SOIA would listen to this and not at all get it. Terrible execution.
2,Not for small water gardens,Really did not see a difference after using product. Still have clarity problem but it's not sludge. This product is probably for larger ponds.
4,It works but don't use more than you need,I enjoy feeding my fish so some are over two feet long and none under a foot. Its safe to say I get a fair amount of waste on the bottom of my 800 gallon pond. I bought sludge away to help the filter and i will say the it did its job and when the catfish swim hard on bottom you don't see them stir anything up. The only thing is that my water is tinted like light tea and I used the recommended 1 oz/100 gal.
5,Top notch boot,"I got a pair of these from Ecco directly as a replacement. I do a lot of outdoor work logging, splitting, tractor, hiking. These are the best boots i have ever owned. They are pricey but I think they are worth it. Better than even the high end Wolverines or Doc Martins I have tried. They feel like slippers but are tough as nails. I wear them all day even in the summer. You could really do anything in these boots. Comfortable enough for long hikes but tough enough for every day labor. Ecco hit one out of the park with this boot."
3,ECCO Track IV Plain Toe High,"I had these shoes for about a month, and just as they were really becoming broken in, a two-and-a-half inch tear developed between the mid-sole and the bottom sole. I am pretty disappointed because I own three other pairs of ECCO shoes and they all have performed really well, so I was shocked that the sole failed so quickly."
3,Brilliant author,"Mark Perakh is a physics professor. He has written a series of book reviews of books by Dembski, Behe, Johnson, Ross, Jeffrey, Heeren and others. Unintelligent Design is not a sustained attack on intelligent design. The first chapter, on Dembski, is the longest chapter I have ever read, is highly technical, and becomes tedious and boring. The book becomes easier going in the chapters on Johnson and Jeffrey. This book also contains essays on the scientific method, probability and the Bible code. Perakh has written a devastating critique of the Bible code. The author several times uses ""like"" where ""as"" is meant, and he uses ""meaningless"" when ""wrong"" is meant."
3,Highlights and lowlights,"Perakh isn't a dumb guy, and he does a great job with some of the intellectual issues, especially in regard to probability theory. What drags this book down, and what drags most books down that take a similar approach, is that Perakh spends far too much time mixing in ideology with science. Unfortunately, for the open-minded skeptics like myself, this does little to relieve the suspicion that there is an extreme amount of dogma on both sides of the issue. An exemplary of ""how to do it right"" is Stuart Kauffman, and I would encourage both sides of the intelligent design debate to take his lead and run with it. For those of us with open minds - humility and charity are preferred to pompous ridicule."
5,Intelligently debunking intelligent design,"Perakh has really done it! For years, I have been studying creationist exegeses designed to ""prove"" harmony between science and the Book of Genesis, and I have been studying intelligent-design pseudoscience. I thought there was nothing new under the sun. I was delighted, therefore, to find any number of original observations in this book. This book should become a handbook for anyone who wants to counter Ross and Schroeder, on the one hand, and Dembski and Behe, on the other."
2,Doesn't answer how spontaneous emergence emerges,"Enjoyable reading. Fine and creative arguments for Design- Unintelligence having dominance. But doesn't answer the key issues of Design-Intelligence: who or what impulse was the origin and catalyst for emergence of Design-Unintelligence? Who or what kept providing the propulsion (engine & fuel) to maintain this Perpetual Motion Selectio-mechanism machine called evolution by natural selection?Design-Intelligence answers these key issues with evidence that is persuading more and more scientists and non-scientists. Until Design-Unintelligence can grapple with these key issues, Intelligence wins out over Unintelligence, no matter how rigorous the detailed arguments and data engagement."
5,"Transparent, convincing and entertaining.","I was intrigued by the title of that book, which seemed to indicate that its author would concentrate on the problem of suboptimal design. However, as I started reading I soon realized that it is much more than I expected. Dr. Perakh capitalized on his background as a physicist to debunk a whole series of popular neo-apologetic books, written both from Christian and Judaic standpoints. His analysis of errors in the books by Ross, Schroeder, Aviezer, Heeren and others is not only very transparent but also entertaining. Highly recommended to anybody interested in the controversy that has arisen recently because of the advent of the Intelligent Design movement and its Wedge echelon. Five stars!"
2,Science In The Eyes of a Scientist=Atheist,"This books is full of ideology and sparse on courtesy. Perakh attempts to play the part of the unbiased, cool, collected and rational scientist. Meanwhile, he casts his adversaries as ""arrogant"" ""ingoramuses"". Worse yet, he tries to undermine the work of Dembski and Behe by not so subtley equivocating their work with the work of Bible Coders and preachers.Perhaps one day we will see a book on intelligent design that deals squarely with the intellectual ideas. This is not that book.Not recommended."
2,Remember Voltaire?,"Whether Dr. Perakh is entirely wrong, partially right, or entirely right is almost irrelevant. Anyone trying to understand his ideas has to dig them out of a tremendous pile of dirt he heaps on his opponents' (or victims?) heads. This alone makes his arguments highly suspect. There are few, if any, cases when someone resorting to vicious personal attacks in a purportedly scientific argument has been right."
3,"awesome, but more of an EP than a full length","there's just not enough songs. and though the atmospherics make the album, there's as much buildup as there is payoff... an album with songs this epic should run an hour, but september 000 doesn't even hit 30 min. still, release it as an EP an i agree with the other reviews, it's awesome. this album comes off so naturally it feels like the secret machines just casually threw it together, but at the same time, it's totally crafted."
5,local citizen - fascinating gentleman,"Former Ambassador Warren was a most fascinating person - very aristocratic, yet down-to-earth. He was a family friend as long as I can remember. (He lived in Greenville, TX in his later years, when we knew him.) He had so many interesting tales to share. A wonderful person to know and talk with. I haven't read the book yet (I'm purchasing it now), but I'm sure it's great, knowing him. History is all about people, and he was talented at reading people and situations... very intelligent, of course, with great insight.Fletcher Warren Reporting for Duty Sir"
4,heads up...,"charm was beautiful, be careful, though, because it is only one-sided. The front is the silver heart, but the back side has the indentation and black color. Probably better as a necklace charm than for a charm bracelet."
5,Excellent,Really liked this... and yes Mio captures the center stage.... I always wondered why so much anime desktop art was of her... now I know... you of course need to view season 1 first. Hopefully there is a follow on with them in college continuing the band to their ultimate goal...
1,Disappointed,"The Amazon review above states =Newcomers and out-of-practice participants will find an informative and approachable program in the 30-minute beginner's form=. I beg to differ. Never have I been so disappointed from an Amazon purchase and misled from the overwhelmingly chipper reviews. I found the tape frustrating, lacking clear instructions or enough ""variations"" of the poses for people who aren't contortionists. You indeed need to watch the tape a few times to even attempt to keep up with the pace. Unless you really are comfortable with yoga for a few years, I say try another tape. I'm going right now to sell mine online. I hope someone buys it."
2,great yoga - low quality dvd disc,"I enjoyed what I saw, but the dvd seem to be very low quality. Two of the three lessons go corrupt half way through while watching.I would try to find a digital copy to buy and not risk buying corrupt dvd"
5,Very nice DVD,"This dvd is worth to have and I'm very happy to have it now. I must to say thanks for amazon.com company for they have sent this item so quickly to me. This dvd is necessary to have for all yoga lovers, because sometimes we have no time to do our yoga practice and this dvd gives you advice how to make it short but very useful before you start your work day. So enjoy it :)"
4,Excellent!,"I got this DVD several years ago and have since also purchased Bryan Kest's, Rodney Yee's, and several others for variety. My husband and I always return to David Swenson! We find his voice instruction and workout flow the best. His instruction syncs up perfectly with the workout and I always feel I'm getting a great overall workout in 30 mins. My husband will do the 15 min. if he's short on time, but we find the 30 min. workout feels the best. The 45 min is a little too advanced for us so when we want a longer workout we go with Rodney Yee. (we've both been practicing yoga for several years and we find ourselves well past the beginner stage but not anywhere near being able to perform some of the more advanced moves that are awe-inspiring but don't feel doable) True, the production quality of some of the newer DVD's are beautiful but don't be fooled by the shiny covers, David Swenson is the best! I wish he would put out a newer DVD!"
2,Annoying Chatter...,"I was very disappointed with this video. I found Swenson's talkative style distracting and unnecessary. Rather than allowing you to breath and experience the poses on your own, this tape subjects you to a constant barrage of commentary. I practice yoga to escape mindless chatter, so this tape wasn't for me."
5,Was this recorded in 1977 during the first punk wave?,"LOVE this band!! I saw them open for the Damned about two years ago and have been a fan ever since. If you are looking for old school punk (spiky hair, skinny ties, pogoing & spit) and don't mind a record that has a shoestring production type sound... dude are you in for a treat!!Highlights include ""Poor & Wierd"", ""Rotten Love"", ""New Pair of Shoes"" and ""Dolly Parton"".... but in reality the whole thing is a real kick in the pants begining to end!"
5,I like it like babies on speed.,"This band, at a whopping 5 stars, sound like a mix of the dickies and j. thunders with a little speacail ingrediant of their own. They made love with my ears. I like to see them live. The boys make goodness with my dancing feet."
2,is it really over?,"not the typical bargain music. buyer beware. not saying there arent any good songs just not as many. they seemed to float away from the reggae style. for the ones purchasing this for the vocally extraordinare, Josh Fischel, beware. didnt have to many of his slow accoustic songs with him wailing away with his original syle."
4,"Loved Hope, disappointed in Penny","This author is obviously one of the good dog people who listen to their dogs. This is the sequel to Nop's Trials. Hope is Nop's son. Lewis gave the dog to his daughter Penny to help her to recover from the death of her husband and daughter in a car accident. Penny becomes obsessed with the dog and sheepdog trials and becomes fairly successful. Wanting to be close to her, Lewis and Nop rejoin the sheepdog circuit with great success in the ring, and somewhat less with his daughter. Hope, Nop, and Lewis and his wife do well in the end, but I am disappointed in his daughter and hope that her situation will resolve itself in time."
2,Sleepless in Vegas,I bought this to help with my wife's restless leg syndrome and her hard time of getting to sleep during bedtime. She said that it made her even more restless and prevented her to go to sleep.
3,Description was very vague,I have been looking all over the place for a book on Pennsylvania wildlife for my granddaughter who live in another state. I was very happy to find this.
3,not a rating a question,"there is no information for this item. is it Monsters the old tv series? is it the first season if so. and does this include the episode ""holly's house""? definately some valid questions and if it is all three it would definately be worth its weight in gold."
2,Ease of Use,"The button for Play,Pause,Fast Forward, etc. is very difficult to use. Sometimes have to hit it several times before it functions."
5,A beautifully entertaining story,"A little girl can't go to sleep, so the wind asks what he could do to help. And that is the flow of the story ~~ as nighttime winds down to the soft sigh of the wind.There is a magical quality to this book ~~ one that keeps me reading in delight. (If I have to read these books to my kids, it better be enjoyable for me too!) The pictures are beautifully illustrated. I am now a David Jorgensen fan. And I really enjoy Katy Rydell's writing in this book. It's very musical and lyrical ~~ whimiscal too. It's a delightful book for my children to hear before they go to bed. And the pictures are a joy to behold.This is one purchase we won't regret buying!10-15-03"
1,PASS,"Im sick of these sound alike bands- this stuff has been donemany times before, but better- this is wimpy music. Stay away!"
5,New stuff from Jayy,"First of all i love this cd, it is my favorite of all time. I love his voice and the simplicity of his lyrics that catch and hook you throught the whole cd.But after familiar 48 broke up jayy(the lead singer) is making a new cd and has the first single on his website to listen to. I have listen to it and it rocks check it out at Jayymannon.comBuy this and the next cd and you wont be dissapointed!"
5,The best cd you never heard of.,"This is the best band you have never heard of. I can't compare them to anybody, because nobody sounds this good from front to back of a cd....If you like creed, tonic, dishwalla, july for kings, greenwheel, collapsis, nickleback, etc.. You will love this cd and soon will love it alot more than the above bands latest efforts. I am a HUGE creed fan, but this band is better from front to back of the cd. I have no clue why they are not popular. ... I'm telling you buy this cd right now."
4,i can see it- This band will be big,"When first putting this CD into my headphone cd player, I was suprised of such good quality off a debut album. The lyrics were fresh, instrument playing was tight, and the singing itself wasn't bad. This group did remind me of Default and Nickelback a bit, but for the most part they are making a good name for themselves. Since these sort of bands are big right now (Lifehouse, The Calling, Default, etc) I think this band will be right alongside of them. Not that it's a bad thing."
3,"Decent attempt at what copying Bush, Creed, etc.....","They're not overly talented at playing their instruments and there's no groundbreaking producing on the album but it's decent and a couple of the songs, most notably ""the question"", ""on my own"" and ""i know"" are the type that get stuck in your head if they're the last song you hear as you exit your car. sure they sound somewhat similar to bush, creed, live, goo goo dolls, and about four-dozen other bands, but how diverse and original can you expect a genre of music which utilizes 3 chords, the guitar-bass-drum formula and teen angst. they're not exactly blazing an original trail but not every band can be A Nirvana, Beatles, or a Metallica in terms of inventing a sound. if you want a good album which you'll find yourself humming and singing along with grab it."
5,On their way up,I've been following this local Philadelphia band for 2 years now and I love them now as much as the first time I saw them. Jayy has this amazing voice and a great sense of feeling in his songs. Their songs are really catchy and you will find yourself singing along with them! They are great guys and a great band and I can see them climbing the charts real quick.
5,Fabulous Familiar48!,"I have to tell you this CD is excellent! Every song on ""Wonderful Nothing"" is so great, it'll take me listening to it over and over again, to chose a favorite song.....very seldom does one buy a CD by any artist, without getting a few duds...but I have to say these guys are pure talent~ A blend of beautiful lyrics with a sound that takes the songs all the way~ Refreshing heartfelt soul with a definite new rock edge!! You won't be dissappointed!!"
5,One of the best Emo CDs out there,"This is honestly my favorite Emo CD. The lyrics are amazing and really come from the heart. A combination of good music and catchy choruses make this such a good album from start to finish. They use a perfect blend of acoustic and electric, something you can listen to over and over. Personal favorites include: Place of You, Endings, and I Know. Nothing can beat the heartfelt emotions of Familiar 48."
3,Dumbed down for production line educators,"If the book was meant to provide a quick overview of American history as a two week long introduction to more profound study it would rate 5 stars. But this book is being used as a textbook to present the totality of American history to high school students. I've read the book and talked to educators who are using it to teach American history. It is being misused as a textbook. Some are saying this is THE book to use for teaching American history. That's like saying all the news worth knowing can be found in USA Today. The 3 stars is for the trend this book represents. Otherwise, it may be OK if applied properly as a sparse intro to American history."
4,A new and more experienced Vivanativa,"The album is great, and the songs show they were really worked out, the packaging is a bit flimsy, but still ok. These guys can rock, everything from blues to ballads, to pop oriented tunes. They sound even better live. Lets hope sales are good and that they can do a crossover like other artistsn from Puerto Rico such as ricky martin and Puya"
1,Waste of Money,"No organization or explanation here - just a waste of time and money. Comprised of long, boring sections that are nothing more than a layman's translation of the statutes with no paragraphs, highlights, breakdown or summary, followed by lists upon lists of sample questions, again with no organization or explanation. Look elsewhere for something that will actually teach you and prepare you for the test."
1,"Dated Material, Incorrect Information","I studied this book, but it was a waste of my time.I found out that it was about New York State exam after I got it. But I thought basic information would be the same and it would help even though it is about the New York exam. But I found that this is dated material and has some incorrect information. Taking a 6 hour Notary class and the 2 sample exams they gave me in class helped much more than this book did. I felt that it was a waste of my time to study this book and would recommend using updated exam material from your state."
4,"Important well-written book, but I couldn't finish","I bought this book on the advice of many professionals (nurses, professors, social workers) who rave about it. It deserves the raves and it did teach me a lot. But, about two-thirds of the way through, I just couldn't take it anymore. Make sure you are ready to trudge through a history that goes from bad to worse. I, however, may be too close to the subject. The social worker portrayed in the book plays a dual role where she has the child removed from the home and simultaneously becomes a champion (albeit ultimately ineffective) of getting the child proper medical care and subsidies for the family. I am a social worker of many years and I found myself despairing about my own profession. Important book, I repeat! Cautionary tale that needed to be told and is told very well. Not a light read by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Watch OUT for the wrong assumptions about HMONG,"Good book!!! I'm HMONG myself... and if you ever read this book, watch out for the assumptions made about the Hmong people, and the negative comments...argh!! I underlined all the wrong assumptions and the negative comments.... you wouldn't believe some of the things people would say! anyway, it's still an interesting book, some facts about the Hmong people in the book are true though. It just really upsets me that the book protrayed the Hmong people to be DUMB and STUPID."
5,A wish for the future,"I can only hope that Ann Fadiman is the FIRST and ONLY person permitted to communicate with any alien who chooses to land on this planet and all others must read her findings before any further contact is attempted. We cause such unmeasurable damage out of ignorance, as Lea and her family endured, when we see the world in one demention only. If this can happend when bright and well- intentioned people interact with other bright and well-intentioned people-if of another culture- I fear what mayhem we may cause when we come in contact with members of another species. Makes me hope that SETI is an excersise in futility."
2,interesting concept but too drawn out,"the main story of a little girl receiving sub-par health care due to 1)a lack of communication and 2) the inability for the Hmong and American cultures to mix is a great idea. However, too much Hmong culture and history is thrown in that seems out of place. I would not have read this unless it was mandatory."
1,BORING,Had to read this book for school... it took everything I had not to throw it in the fireplace and turn it to ash. What a ridiculous thing to write about - foreigners who can't read or write English & their child is hurt. Compassion for child? Yes. Compassion for parents? No.This is a boring read.. move on to something else if this is not a mandatory read.
1,Sympathy Please!,"After carefully reading this book, one can easily draw the conclusion that this book is merely a plea for sympathy of Hmongs living in America. Obviously the author wants a much more expansive government health care system to cover these immigrants. The author makes it apparent to the reader that it was not the Hmongs fault for immigrating here and becoming a burden to our system. She justifies it through her vendetta against U.S. involvement in Vietnam/Laos. Quite clearly Fadiman wishes to express her extreme views in order to gain sympathy for these poor, uneducated, helpless Hmongs."
4,The tragedy of cross-cultural miscommunication,"The Spirit Catches you was a wonderful, yet tragic book. It was very well written and gave me a look at what it must be like to immigrate to this country - AND - what it must be like to serve a community of immigrants. Although it is not a novel, it has many elements of fiction in it... the story of a family and their experiences through the hardships of life. The book lacks the happy ending of most novels, however. There are times throughout the book when I had to put it down, because of the emotion of the story.I highly recommend this book. If you serve the public in any capacity, I would consider this book required reading. I do suggest that you keep a dictionary nearby - Ms. Fadiman has quite a vocabulary!"
5,So good!,I loved reading this book. It is amazing at showing you the vast cultural differences between the American doctors and the Hmong family experience.
4,Spirit catches you,I enjoyed this book a lot because it conveyed to me the strength of a community and their fight to never give up. It made me aware of how ignorant people can be and how frustrating a communication barrier can be especially when people are saying basically the same thing but don't understand that. This Hmong family loved and cared for their daughter so much and never believed for a second that she wasn't worth it. Many times the family was told that their daughter was going to die but they never lost hope. The Lia's family never stopped caring and that's what family should always do. It made me realise that people in our society may give up too soon on people who were in the Lee's situation. This book teaches the value of life.
4,Required....in a good way,"This was required reading for my Intro to Sociology class at college my freshman year. I have to say, at first glance I thought it would be a bore, however I was pleasantly surprised to the contrary. The author writes in a detailed but simple manner which helps to bring the reader in quickly. There is such a conflict in the story between cultures that the reader cannot help but wish that there was something that they could do. You grow to love and sympathize with many of the characters throughout the story.This is a very interesting, and oddly enough, quick read for a book of it's size. Defintely go pick it up."
5,A Story of Unconditional Love,"There are many themes in this book-unconditonal love, cultural clashes and misunderstandings. The author does an excellant job of telling both sides of the issue-the medical establishment's frustration at what they perceive as noncompliant parents and the parent's frustration at what they perceive as people trying to take their child away. Fadiman alternates between the story of a family trying to do what they believe is right for their child and the medical care the child receives, and the history of the Hmong. The history is very well done, as is the entire book."
4,A non-biased journalistic approach,"In contrast to what some other reviewers have written, I found this book very non-biased. As a physician, I felt neither attacked, nor blamed. Rather, I felt that the author portrayed both sides of the problem in a very nonjudgmental, journalistic manner. It has made me more mindful of the cultural issues that may be affecting my patient's ability/willingness to comply with my treatment regimens."
3,The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,This book is worthwhile to read to learn more about the Hmong people. It gives a good background on these people without glossing over some of the bad stuff.It would be good for the medical anthropology student.
4,"Got it for school, it didn't bore me to tears","I got this for a class I hated, with a prof I hated, and I also hated the other students for the most part. I believe I got a B- in this class, so for me to say that this a pretty good book really means something."
3,The Spirit Catches you and you Fall Down A Hmong Child,"I enjoyed what I read but I clicked on something which told me more than I needed to know about epilepsy etc and I could not figure out how to get back to the end of the book .ps. You had my daughter , Sarah Eberhart's name on this and she has not ordered this book. She ordered a How to Book re the Paper White and got the wrong one and tried to cancel it but couldn't figure out how to do it. Please contact her."
3,Cultural Clash,"In the Hmong culture, epilepsy is viewed as a gift from God. But in this case, there was indifference on the part of the medical staff to reach across the cultural divide and find a way to help this child, who ended up surviving severe brain damage and living several decades in a coma. It is a fascinating and troubling view of one of the ways in which our medical system needs to be reformed."
3,g,"Book was okay, gave insight into a culture different from my own. Good read, interesting although some parts were dry/confusing."
3,Too Much,"As a physician who teaches the art of medicine this novel covered very well the nuances and the overt cultural barriers and how they play into the very real therapy of patients. She did it in a non judgmental way . However this book is twice as long as it needed to be and it begins to drag with endless details about the earlier Hmong life, it becomes a historic novel, much obviously important to set off the cultural points but it finally became a little boring. Overall an excellent addition to literature for docs but just finally overwritten."
5,Enlightening!,"My family sponsored what I now believe to be a Hmong family in the late 1970's or early 1980's. My parents were very disappointed when the family from Laos didn't move to Utah, as planned, but elected to live in California, because they were told that Utah had only snow and cold. My son has recently lived and worked among the Hmong in the Sacramento area, and has learned to love and respect them."
3,Cultural divide in the medical field,"This was an assigned book for an English class. It really depicts the divide between culture and medicine. There were many themes we were able to pull from this true story I.e. cultural divides, medicine vs. spirituality, language barriers and cultural issues in the medical world and Hmong history. Good book."
1,The spirit catches you and you fall down,The Spirit catches you and you fall down: titleI chose this rating because I paid for it and never received it on my Kindle.i still want to receive the book!!
2,It just went on and on and on,"I really wanted to like this book, honestly. Sadly, I just couldn't finish it. From the start we know the ending, so the story is about the details. I just couldn't get into those details or feel for the family."
2,More like ... you fall asleep.,"Ok, let's just call it what it is - a chic book. That can be good and bad I guess. For me, I couldn't stay awake. In fact, I only made it halfway through. This is for the type of people who dig historical fiction or for those who pretend to care about human suffering. Suffering which will never be theirs yet serves as a good platform for sterile discussion."
1,I couldn't have asked for less,"In short: elongated. Fadiman has the perspicacoius ability to take an anecdotal quip and stretch it out to the length of, well, this 300 page book. Buyer beware: you're getting much more than you bargain for with this one. Overly-specific med-speak, tens of pages of garment description and an overview of the Vietnam War all seemed to have enough weight that Fadiman could wedge them comfortably in this tale about a sick little girl. Whether you're looking for action, drama, comedy or informative writing, you'll find none of it here. Let's just hope this is Fadiman's second and final work."
1,"Oh Boo, hoo","While the Hmong culture's values of stubborn solidarity, family unity, & a new desire to become educated should help them thrive in America, this book should not be a chapter in their cultural history that they are proud of.Chosen ignorance, even if due to a defeatist attitude from generations of abuse, is a pretty poor way to show love for your child. The mom never even learned numbers so she could dial a phone for help. & animistic superstitions make for some entertaining stories, but people from an American upbringing that really believe them aren't playing with a full deck of cards.In summary, a wayyyyy long drawn out, super boring, overly detailed, tedious story. Could easily have been told in 5 fairly interesting chapters & still kept in the sob stories about how the Hmong suffered, don't really want to be here, & it's not their fault."
5,Great book,I ciould not put this down. it was an incredible look into a culture. The history of the H'Mong was very interesting.
2,if it weren't a required reading....,"This was OK. I had to read it as part of my Asian studies curriculum. This wasn't completely boring, and I did learn things I never knew about the Hmong culture. But really, I'm no PhD in Asian studies so I would definitely not have read this for leisure."
3,The Spirit Catches You When You Fall,"While imparting a great deal of information about the Hmong and their struggles against the reigning Laos government, it reads more like a history book than a novel."
5,If we do not live in a bubble ....,"If we do not live in a bubble, we in the US today need to know more about each other. Gone are the days when we could reply, ""It wasn't in the curriculum."" If we want to practice anything, i.e. medicine, mental health, HR, management - anything - we need to know how to share in learning about ourselves and about each other."
5,Eye Opening,"Being in the healthcare field I knew I wanted to side with the decisions the healthcare team made when people were telling me about the book. All that changed the moment I opened the book. I oscillated back and forth siding with the family and then the medical professionals, until about half way through the book when I finally settled down and opened my mind to the words of the author. Now done with the book I realize there never were two sides. I realize that there were no wrongs and no rights, but a series of tragic mistakes. My eyes are opened and my mind is armed with the knowledge this book brought. This is a book everyone today needs to read. In a society where we place so much blame on one thing or another we need to remember that we are all on the same side it is to our benefit to approach the situation with an open mind and a lot of understanding. Otherwise the results could be as devestating as they were for the family in this book."
5,David R Grube MD,"If there is one book that all medical students should read, more important than Gray's Anatomy, more important than Saultz' Family Medicine Text, it is this tragically wonderful book about a little girl and the whole world. Read it!"
4,Bridging A Gap,"It is often an arduous task to bridge the gap between two conflicting cultures. I think it is very important that all health providers understand that it is crucial to incorporate a patients culture and beliefs into the care they are prescribed. As someone outside of the culture, Anne Fadiman does a good job of embracing the culture and trying to understand their feelings on healing. It is disturbing to detect the sense of superiority that one culture feels they have over another. At the very least this book should open the minds of its readers, especially health care providers, to the importance of cultures and perspectives outside of their own."
2,Drowning in Details...No Matter How Fascinating,"While I am only about half way through this book, I'm so very frustrated with it that I felt compelled to write a review. I won't deny that the subject matter of this book is both heart wrenching and, at times, appalling as the reader is taken on a difficult journey of exploring 2 cultures clashing at the expense of a defenseless child. However the writers overuse of details, her desire to focus on the menusha and her tangents and asides really bog down this book for me. Perhaps her having written mostly for publications hasn't cultivated her writing so that a successful book might result. This story may have been better told in a 3 or 4 part magazine series or on multi-night series on Dateline or 20/20. I will stick with this book since it is my Book Club read and (perhaps) I will reconsider my strong feelings as I read on, but I feel the writer has done this story an injustice."
1,Still waiting,Ordered this book back at the very beginning of January.. Still have not received it. Ugh. Need this for class and I'm missing out on important points.
4,:),I'm very happy with this purchase.The description was accurate and shipping was timely.I would definately order from this user again.
2,Ethnic Details,"While the author seems very well versed on the Hmong culture, beliefs and primitive healing methods, she carries this information too far and in too much depth. This would be a good textbook for a student who wants to study the Hmong people, but certainly not for pleasure reading."
2,Book Review,"The book itself was reasonably priced. However, I did not enjoy reading it. I had to read it for a diversity issues class in grad school, but was glad when the portion of the class dealing with this book was over. It made me feel very frustrated with the Hmong people and how their adoption towards western culture would only happen if it was convenient for them. Overall, not the greatest read."
5,The hardest book I have ever had to read & highly worth reading,"Going for my MSW at Rutgers., we have been assigned this book to read and do a group presentation upon. It is heartbreaking, yet at the same time, extremely revealing how the conflict of cultures can hinder medical treatment in the U.S.A. Particularly, the arrogance of Western educated medicine comes into play on how thethis family is treated by many, except a handful, who come into their path while treatingthe daughter with severe epilepsy. Also, the U.S. involvement in the Hmong massacre during the Vietnam war is eye-opening, and makes you wonder, again, what isIraq really all about (as if I don't know)., NOT ABOUT SPREADING""democracy"" OR prosperity....A MUST READ...."
3,Interesting and needs to be read by every medical intern!,A sad but true story of multi-cultural ignorance on the part of the dominant medical etablishment. A bit repetative but informative.
4,you will devour to the last page,"Anne Fadiman relates a true story of a Hmong family stroked by culture shock when their youngest child is diagnosed with Epilepsy, to the family the disease is known as ""Quaug dab peg"" or the spirit catches and you fall down. A battle between the doctors and the parents is created on whom will provide the best treatment. The spirit catches you and you fall down is highly recommended-you will devour to the last page."
3,Decent book....just decent.,"This book was very interesting in the beginning. It talks about Hmong history and the differences between American and Hmong traditions/culture. It was also eye-opening to hear how our medical system treats people who just plain don't fit into our lifestyle. Also, the story was fairly well told from both perspectives. My biggest con toward the book is the writing style. While it is inclusive yet not too long-winded, the organization and structure is lacking. Overall, though, I recommend this book if you have ever known a Hmong person or heard little about them, but know nothing of their culture."
1,Bore you to pieces,"This story could have been told in a much more readable way. It could also be quite a few less pages if the author didn't constantly repeat herself. Not to mention that it was all over the place. One minute we are in the hospital, the next we are in the Lee's home... Then we are in Lao? What happened to chronological order? I don't care about every ounce of history in the 2,000 years of the Hmong culture. Spare me some and give me what is relevant to my profession. This was brutal. If you can avoid it, don't buy this book. Borrow it from someone that has highlighted the parts of significance and skim it. Horrible."
4,Great read and informative,I thought this book was very insightful and gave me so much to think about. I work in the medical field and take care of Hmong patients occasionally so it was helpful in understanding their culture. Very interesting.
5,Laotian people in USA,"What an incite into the cultural differences between the Laotian population and the Americans, and the problems faced when they come to America. Especially if they have health issues."
5,Wonderful Insight,"I completely enjoyed this book. The author offers great insight into Hmong culture and the American culture by relaying a true story without throwing personal opinions and biases into the mix. This book encourages the reader to look deeper within themselves to analyze the roots of their own thoughts and actions. This is a must read for any American, not just those with a medical interest. Lessons can be learned by all."
5,Book of many emotions,Tears and weeks of reading and putting the book down. It pains me to think we as Western healthcare providers are so shallow to think there is but one way ... our way.
5,Touching,"A great book to understand some of the problems with healthcare today. As a pessimist, I found the book opened up some of the problems with health care today."
5,A read for all ages,One of my favorite books of all time. My Cultural Anthropology teacher had us read this book and I don't regret one minute of it. It's a very touching and compelling book. You will not want to put it down once you get going. I believe that it's a great read for all for it really opens your eyes up to another families culture and their intimate life. The knowledge you will acquire from this book is worth the time spent reading it. So buy it!
5,Excellent Read,This book is excellent. Written with an unbiased opinion. I could not put it down. It made me examine how I view others.
4,The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down,"For those readers that enjoy understanding other cultures this is a very easily read book on the Hmongs. You are introduced to the Hmong's culture and customs through the medical community in Merced,CA. The doctors have the arduous task of caring for a Hmong toddler diagnosed with severe epilepsy. The total lack of understanding of the Hmongs by professionals within the social system, physicians, and community is explored and examined. They are an intelligent and complex people deserving of our respect."
5,A beautiful book.,"This isn't just a story about an immigrant girl lost in the labyrinth of western medicine, but of human beings who lose sight of the soul, their own and those inhabiting the other. I understood for the first time how a country like ours can indiscriminately bomb and destroy another country without any thought to the annihilation of human life by seeing it first on an individual level: Lia and family meet their western doctors. Fadiman tells a compelling story in a very even-handed manner."
4,Good Book,"I didn't know much about this translation of the Bible, but was very pleased when I started reading it. It is a good experience reading a different translation because it can help you see the passages you have read before in a new way. I found the modern day language easy to read, and The side bars about what the true meaning of words or customs very helpful and informative. The Bible also has the words of Jesus in red.Review from Wanda"
5,The Perfect Gift!,"STAR BABY is the perfect gift for any newborn or toddler! Margaret O'Hair and Erin Eitter Kono have created a timeless picture book that all children should experience over and over again. The love and support that are evident throughout are sure to instill a sense of safety and self-worth to children at a very young age. Now, that's a gift!"
5,A stellar book!,"A wonderful book to read with babies, toddlers and young children alike. Children enjoy rhyming along as you read the book."
3,Too Similar,"I thought that this book was too similar to Joan Bauer's other book Rules of the Road. Although I enjoyed both very much, they are very close in terms of character qualities and themes of each story. I hope that you have also noticed these similarities, however still enjoyed these books."
4,Not What I expected,"Because of Hope's situation and the kinda rough-looking cover picture, I expected her to be a more hardened character- I thought her name would turn out to be ironic. Well, that wasn't the case. In fact, Hope is young for her sixteen years, and has remained stubbornly optimistic in spite of being abandoned by her mother. Her naivete and, sometimes, immaturity bothered me at times, but the plot was strong (a heated political race between the corrupt current mayor and a diner owner who, although much more scrupulous, is dying of cancer). The quirky characters and the surprising ending kept me interested, and I finished it in about a day and a half. A worthwhile read- but perhaps more appropriate for a middle-grade audience than the recommended ""young adult."""
3,Excellent story about a girl who has lot's of problems,"Hope Was Here by Joan Bauer was an excellent book. I reckemend it to anybody who likes to read. I really like this book, because it makes me fell like I am really there. With the characters. This is the first Bauer book I have read. It makes me want to read more. Hope is a 18 year old girl, who is a waitress. While working Hope makes a new friend, named G.T. G.T has cancer. But, he's running for mayor. Since he has cancer nobody thinks that he would make a good mayor. Does G.T. die while trying to become mayor? Read Hope Was Here and find out!"
5,Kool,"Hope was here, by Joan Bauer, is a fascinating and funny glimpse of one girls life, a life filled with good food, romance, eccentricities and family. Hope is our sixteen year old narrator, a waitress working with her aunt in a rural town's diner, who takes a humourous view on her unusual life. Reading Hope's voice is like talking to an old friend. Miss Bauer created a likable character, but Hope does have her faults which makes her all the more real to us. Not only are the characters great in this book. The author wrote with lots of description and feeling, allowing readers to feel grief when sorrowful events occur, happiness when happy things happen, feel every sensation, taste every food. Whether you're looking for a good laugh, a good cry, or just a good story, Hope Was Here has something for everyone.By the way, that was for my school review. ---Meg"
5,MORE THAN JUST A GREAT STORY... A TRUE GIFT OF HOPE!,"Hope Was Here is exactly what its title suggests: a story full of HOPE. Joan Bauer's writing style is EXCELLENT - she writes in a way that everyone can relate to, and her characters become so real that they seem almost tangible. This book has it all: humor, great characters, a page-turning plot, and above all, a message that sinks deep into your soul. Bauer looks at life from a charming and humorous perspective while also exploring very deep issues in a sensitive and heart-warming manner. This book is NOT just for young readers -- I would HIGHLY recommend it to readers of ALL AGES who want a good story that will touch their heart and leave a long-lasting impression. Thank you, Joan Bauer, for an incredible book that left me with a heart full of HOPE!"
4,Hope was definetely here!,Though the title and cover is misleading- i wuz thinking it had something to do with the world trade center- it turned out to be an incredible book about a girl's journey as a waitress with her aunt to wisconson- where she seriously begins a new life- that often gets visits from her old life. This is also i must read book u will be intrigued to read in one sitting- it ends on a sad yet happy note that will leave u longing for a sequal- A must read for high schoolers!
4,Hope was here,"This book, ""Hope was here"" is a great story about love, friendship, family and politics. It is about a girl and her aunt who move from New York to a small town in Wisconsin. They have to move because the restaurant that they were working at went out of buisness and there is one in Wisconsin that needs employees. At this restaurant, Hope is a waitress and Aunt Addie is one of the cooks. At the restaurant they also met nice people like, Braverman who is also one of the cooks, G.T, their boss who is suffering from lukiemia. G.T. is also running for mayor, but you have to read the book to find out what else happens with that. this book is very interesting and when i was reading it, i didn't want to put it down."
5,Hope Was Here was great.... please read her other books too!,"I've personally had the opportunity to speak with Mrs. Bauer during the spring of 2001 and can tell you that she's as delightful a person as her books are. Hope was Here is truly a magnificent work of young adult fiction that not only every teenager should read, but every adult as well. Digging deep into the heart of small town America and political sabotage, Joan Bauer gives it all and a piece of herself as well. If you liked this book, I most definitely suggest you check out Sticks, Squashed, and especially Rules of the Road ...as they are all spectacular works...."
5,One Of The Best Books Around!,"I have read many books, and Hope Was Here is one of the BEST that I have ever read. Joan Bauer, the author, did an excellent job on this book. The writing is flawless, and I love the way that Bauer compares life to waitressing. Hope Was Here is a book that has everything in it. There are some funny parts, but this book doesn't need humor to make it good. Hope Was Here also has many messages in it, so it's a great read for anyone, whether you're nine or ninety. If you haven't read Hope Was Here, you are missing out on a great story!!"
4,Hope was here,"""Hope was here"" by Joan Bauer is a sad,revolting story. It captures the readers mind.A man named G.T has cancer, wants to be the mayor of his town. Struggles the with the election.A girl named Hope takes G.T has her father.Both her parents left her when she was a small kid.Hope and friends help G.T win the election. The one worry that family members of G.T has is they're worried that one day or later G.T might die."
3,Hope Was Here,"""Believe me when I tell you,"" said Hope, ""I know survival."" Hope Yancey, a 14-year old waitress, experiences a new life, with her amazing aunt Addie, in Mulhoney, Wisconsin. She resides in a house above the best restaurant in Mulhoney, the Welcome Stairways Diner. Hope is introduced to the considerate G. T. Stoops, who is running for mayor against the current, undefeated mayor, Eli Millstone. Even though G. T. Stoops has leukemia, numerous people think he should be mayor, although some people think G. T. has lost his mind. Hope sees the goodness and graciousness of G. T. Stoops, and she will do anything it takes to help him become mayor. Will G. T. win the election? Will Hope finally fit in with the community?I liked Hope Was Here. It is an intriguing book which will make the reader want to know what will happen next in Hope's life. Joan Bauer has written an interesting, political novel, which every politic will find entertaining."
2,Can you say sappy?,"Beware, the good reviews that this book has gotten have been honest, but too forgiving. Hope is sometimes an unbelievable teenager trying to do it all. ... Hope is constantly trying to save the world. Another note is that this book is too short, 186 pages is not enough to develope the complicated plot that the author attempted. I think 30 more pages would be satisfactory. Although I thought that the characters were intriguing, I also thought they needed more faults. The story is very satisfying, but sometimes more should be expected."
1,Hope was Here,"I recently finished the book ""Hope was Here"". The book is about a girl named Hope. Her father abandoned her when she was young. Also her mother didn't want to take care of her so her aunt Addie did. Hope and Addie have worked at a lot of restaurants together. The book takes place in a small Wisconsin town. There also is a person named GT who owns the `Welcome Stairway"". Hope and Addie both work and live at the ""Welcome Stairway"". The main plot is around that GT is running for mayor against the current mayor Eli Millstone.I personally didn't like the book because it never held onto one subject. On the first page who knows what's happening and then it goes to Brooklyn. I recommend this book to nobody at all. It may have gotten a Newberry medal, but ""WHOOP DE DO BAZZLE"". In my opinion I give the book 0 stars."
1,hope was here,this a book called Hope Was Here. It is about a girl a named Addie. Addie lives with her aunt Hope in wisconsin. she lives with her aunt because her mother could no longer take care of her. her mom said she could always count on her sister to do any thing for her. so addie lives with with aunt and misses her mother dearley. her mother told Addie that she could no longer see addie.I did not like the book hope was here because i thougt it change subjects to much. it also didn't tell enought about one person. i would not rcommed this book to anybody it is not a book you can in to.
3,Hope Was Here,"Hope is a teenager girl that lives with her aunt because her mother gave her up at birth.She has moved place to place becasue Addie her aunt is looking for work. The last place she work was closed down. When Hope turn twelve years old she changed her name to hope before it was Hope it was Tullip.

Will he win read the book to find out.I would recamend this book becasue it is full of surprise and adventuresErickson,L aka~ Lilbit"
2,Hope was here,"Do you enjoy adventure books? Do you like books that keep you on the edge of your feet? Well if that is so then I have found the perfect book for you. The title of this particular book is Hope Was Here, writen by Joan Bauer. The main reason thet I would recomend this book is because some people can relate to the main character ""Hope"". She is a teenage that is having her world turned upside down! Her and her sister must move over and over again because every time her sister gets a job she gets it at a diner.and every diner she gets a job at either shuts down or it gets takenover by another company. And when she moves her life gets turned uside down. I am going to stop there because you can read the rest and find out how her life gets turned upside down!BY:Devon Aikens5"
5,An Awesome Book,"This book was fabulous. I must admit that at first I thought it wouldn't be all that great. By the time I was through the first pages it had grabbed my. I am astonished by the balance of humor and touching moments. The story itself is very moving and I completely was fascinated by each and every character. There are so many startling events and twists that I could never put the book down. This is by far the best book I have read this year if not ever. Being a teenage reader, I reccommend this book for anyone of any age."
5,Harvey scores a big goal,"This book is for all adult women who play soccer and then pass this book to your husbands , boyfriends or significant other its a must read !!! Harvey caught the essence of exactly how deprived I felt not being in competitve sports when I was younger . Now later in life I like Harvery's wife became an organizer of women in sports. I felt like Harvey was writing about me . It was truly enjoyable to see a man appreciate and understand his wife's new found interest and ENCOURAGING it . What a wonderful book. Im sure I will see Harvey's wife in our OTH (over the hill) divison one day. Keep kickin it up !!! I recieved this book from my wonderful husband :)"
4,A Nice Addition to A Christian Home,"This is a lovely Bible. The colorful graphics, page layouts, and inserts are appealing to the younger age groups (adults too) and really draw the reader in. The language is clear, easy to read, and easy to follow especially if you are familiar with the traditional KJV. I took one look through it at my local Borders and just had to take it home with me. If you have children, this would make an especially nice gift Bible (I wish I had received one like this back then). I would also recommend this Bible to youth group leaders or youth Bible study groups. As a former youth group leader, this would have been my Bible of choice. The only thing I would recommend to the publisher, if a second edition comes out, is to include maps. I make constant reference to them when I read, and it would be a good way to start teaching youth the Biblical geography we hear so much about in the news today. Otherwise, I really like this Bible. Buy it and enjoy."
1,Never Buy Used,Unfortunately in an effort to save a few bucks I bought this Bible used. Someone had written some pretty vile things throughout the book. Won't do that again.
4,Pretty good,"Smell is very pungent. Works best when carbon is removed from filter. Follow instructions on bottle but do not be afraid to use more than 5mL at a time, depending on how sick your fish is. Good product to have on hand along with Melafix."
5,"Excellent, natural product.",This is an excellent anti-fungal. I use this with my Betta splendens - from fry to adult. Excellent for spawning and community tanks.
3,Did not help my fish,"I've had two Dwarf Gouramis that had fungus (different occasions). I put them into my hospital tank and used Pimafix as per all the instructions. Both DGs died. Now, I cannot be sure why they died. Maybe the fish were too far gone already, both lived for about a day in the hospital tank. All I can say is that it hasn't helped any fish I've treated with so far. In the fish forums that I've visited, most of the opinions is that Pimafix does not help. Anyway, this is just my experience, you might have a different one."
3,Noticeable beauty around the ugliness,"3 1/2The melodically screeching post-punk outfit's early work was always a bit rough around the edges to say the least, largely accounting for such a gritty allure amongst fans. With some of Storm's more thoughtful compositions though we begin to witness the grinding mechanics of front-man Tim Kasher at times yielding into a kinder, gentler thing, which does contrast their wrenching sonic bursts all the more effectively and hinted at the impressive evolution which was to follow."
3,good but not even close,"When i first heard Cursive's ""such blinding stars for starving eyes"" (first LP) I was thrown off my feet and amazed by it. I then learned about the second album and ordered it quickley, assured by other reviews that i had read that it had ""blown their first album out of the water"". No, this album does not even come close to there first one. ""Early Storms"" is very good but, i think that there are magor flaws in the recording of it. Especially the snare drum, sorry to be picky but the drum sounds on there first album are incredible. Second of all the songs on this album towards the end drag like syrup. It lacks the anthem type sound that the first one had. But don't get me wrong, this is no sophmore slump. But if your going to buy this album, get the first one first."
2,"WANTED! PUFF ""BEAT-THIEF"" DADDY","PUFF DADDY IS WANTED FOR STEALING THE FOLLOWING HITS: ""THE MESSAGE"" ""LET'S DANCE"" ""I'LL BE WATCHING YOU"" ETC. PUFF DADDY SUCKS, FOR REAL, WHAT KIND OF LYRIC IS THIS: ""THREE COURSE MEALS/ SPAGHETTI/ FETECHINI / AND VEAL / BUT STEAL / EVERYTHING'S REAL IN THE FIELD / SO WHAT YA CAN'T HAVE NOW LEAVE IN YOUR WILL.."" SOUNDS LIKE JD'S GHOASTWRITING! THE ONLY THING THAT KEEPS THIS DISC MOVING IS THE FACT THAT BIGGIE, BUSTA RHYMES, AND JAY-Z MAKE CAMEOS. SO, PUFF, TURN YO MIC IN AND GET YO SELF A TURN-TABLE AND START PRACTICING."
1,Puff Daddy is an untalented music robber.,"Puff Daddy, stop using Notorious BIG's death to launch your career, you know your music is sh*t. Your songs are as boring as hell, you've destroyed great classics by the Police and Grandmaster Flash and Lisa Stansfield. Leave music alone and get a life."
3,Partying and Grieving,"Many of Puffy's songs on this album are fun, and great when partying, but many other songs are depressing. It is understandable that with the death of B.I.G., Puffy would be distraught, but to express it in his music lowers the listener's spirit.On the other hand, his other songs make up for the bad ones. The songs ""Been Around The World"", ""It's All About the Benjamins"", and ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"" are cool and fun to listen to. I also think ""I'll be Missing You"" is a very nice contribution to the album.This album is cool. I don't agree with all of the songs on this album. But most are good."
1,Worst rap album i have ever bought.,"Puff daddy sucks. When I first bought this album, I was kind of excited to open to it and listen. I thought if he was affiliated with biggie, he must be good. WHOOPS!!! worst waste of 15 dollars! Puff daddy has no talent at all. He is the worst rapper i have ever heard. He needs to stop leeching off off the death of B.I.G. and quit rapping. His producing was alright, but he cannnot rhyme for his life. PUFFY, IF YOU ARE READING THIS, STOP RAPPING. sure, he's getting good business from the 12 year old girl consumers(i'm sure that's who most of the people who wrote the positive reviews are), but when it comes to being decent, he can't. This album sucks. Don't buy this. It is absolutely horrible. Puffy, stay with nickelodeon, you'll always have fans there, but for the real fans, FORGET IT!!! puff daddy is horrible."
1,Burn this CD and try some real hip-hop,"If you really dig this CD, well, you must be new school to the rap game...Try some of these groups CD's for size : A Tribe Called Quest, BDP, Public Enemy, EPMD, Jungle Brothers, Gang Starr, De La Soul, Eric B & Rakim, any of the Heiroglyphics crew, Ultramagnetic MC's, or most rap crews that were kickin it in the late 80's and early 90's.....Try some of these CD's and then rethink what hip-hop is all about... It AIN'T this albumAnd if you still think this album is still the bomb, pick up a copy of ""Full Clip"", the compilation album from Gang Starr to see what sampling, lyrics, and real hip-hop is about.Scott La Rock (peace) must be turning over in his grave right about now... (and if you don't know who THAT is, THAT'S where ya lost!)"
1,Wack,"If you consider this ""classic"" hip-hop, then you don't know nothin' about hip-hop. Hip-hop is based on LYRICS ( something Mr. Combs should be writing more of ), and BEATS ( uninspired at best ). For a real primer in hip-hop, listen to LYRICIST LOUNGE from RAWKUS RECORDS or get some albums from The Roots, Tribe Called Quest, Above the Law or Digable Planets for starters."
4,Stop Hating,"This CD is not that bad, in fact it's pretty good, maybe really good, almost great. OK I won't go that far but I do think this album deserves a little appreciation. Most people who consider themselves true hip-hop fans (like myself) would never have a Puff Daddy CD in their collection they would consider it Pop-Rap this ins't real hip-hop. However, I am not ashamed to admit that I own this CD (don't get it twisted, owning any of his other albums is out of the question). I think the production on this album is excellect, and the fact that Biggie is all over the CD makes it worth owning. The best song on this album is Young G's, a song featuring Biggie and Jay-Z (how's that for real hip-hop?). Don't be so quick to diss Puffy, give this CD a good listen and be honest, it's pretty good."
4,All You Need/Want From Puff Daddy,"Puff Daddy will never be a legend in rap. He's not original, he's skills are weak, and he's commercial. But looking back on ""No Way Out"", which was my first rap album, I find that overall it's not all that bad of an album, but for different reasons than you may think. The main reason I like this album is because of the guests that appear on it. From Biggie Smalls to Twista, almost every rapper from New York appears on the album. And everyone of these rappers lays down lyrical performances that are stellar. Especially Biggie Smalls on ""Victory"". The only song in which Puff really does a nice job on is ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"". But otherwise, ""No Way Out"" is just an album with solid production and tight guest apperences. ""No Way Out"" is the only Puff Daddy album that you need in your collection, because the rest blow."
1,"PUFF DADDY'S ALBUM WAS PHONY, THAT'S WHY WE DON'T LIKE IT","It's not that we think ""No Way Out"" was a bad album, it's just that it was phony. Puff Daddy doesn't write his own lyrics, He samples all His beats, and he took credit for ""I'll Be Missing You"" when he didn't even write any of it. Puff Daddy didn't write any of ""I'll Be Missing You"", and that was the song that made him big. So his album was phony and all the other songs he had like 7 or 8 people writing it when it was only featuring 1 or 2 people. And sampling is okay but when ALL of your songs are samples that just proves you have NO talent."
3,Should be called Notorious B.I.G & The Family,"This CD is not as bad as I had remembered, but his CD's only get worse. The reason this CD is decent is because most of it had a lot help from Notorious BIG. The later releases of P-Diddy show that he is a very weak rapper without his homeboy. As for his homey Mase, thank God he is out of the game. If you look in the credits, the only good song that Sean Combs wrote mostly on his own is ""Can't Nobody Hold me Down,"" and how good is that song if you think about it? Do not buy this new, cause you can find this CD and about twenty more in a used record bin."
4,NoWayOut,Im from the west coast but this is honestly one of the better albums from NY....It is really good wit only a few tracks that you must skip....Except for that this is another goood rap CD ignore the PHDs..another bad thing is that this cd is not itmeless so listening to it in the present time may not sound so good but it was wonderful back in the day 97Best tracks 1. No Way Out (Intro) 2. Victory 3. Been Around the World 4. What You Gonna Do?6. If I Should Die Tonight 8. Young G's9. I Love You Baby 10. It's All About the Benjamins [Remix] 11. Pain 12. Is This the End? 16. I'll Be Missing You 17. Can't Nobody Hold Me Down
2,Could Have Done Better,How can I say this.... This cd was awful except for a couple of good songs but other than that it lacked good beats and good rhymes. I think Puffy could have done a much better job with this album. It wasnt put together very well and in my mind I believe this was his worst album he has ever produced.
1,Misrepresentation of hip hop to this generation,"C'mon now, real heads will not pick this up. Just a blatant attempt of misrepresenting rap music in general to make some quick $$. Aargh go pick up some Gangstarr, Hiero, Company Flow, whatever, you so-called Hip hop fans are bent on ruining this genre of musik."
1,What can be said that hasn't been said already?,"This album is part of a neverending conspiracy, on the part of the big willies/soldiers/gangstas, to dismantle hip-hop music and make it softer and hard to swallow. And most of the record-buying public is playing right along. So sad,it really is. As Prince Paul once said, ""it's a shame hip-hop died so young."""
1,Save your money!,"I know that I'll catch all kinds of hell from a large percentage with my comments,but f#(k it! This is one of the weakest albums ever. Why should I spend my hard-earned money to hear samples from songs I've heard a 1000x's before? Moreover, why should I have to suffer through a lot of posturing and weaka$$ rhymes just to hear the samples? Why do people listen to his $h!t? This ain't music; as a previous reviewer mentioned, this is a product, which is why Puffy shares his fans with all those teenybopper brats.Bottom line: this is commercial hip-pop that most real fans of the music have wisely avoided. all others should do likewise.And one more thing--to all you biters all there with this ""playa hata"" nonsense--grow up! That line is as tired as this album."
1,Wack to the infinite degree...,"Anybody with discernible taste in music and a good deal of common sense will avoid this one. The day he starts making his own music and starts speaking about real world matters instead from his jiggy impulses is the day that he gets props from me. Until then,he's just as disposable as every other fake jack on the mic."
2,Whose this guy think he's fooling?,"I remember first seeing Sean ""Puffy"" Combs in Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Big Poppa"" video sitting in a hot tub. After listening to this album, I'm convinced that's where he should have stayed. He sure as hell doesn't belong in a recording studio. This album exposes Puff as a true pretender in rap music. How many 80's remixes can you have on one record, anyways? His ryhmes are uninspired, his vocals simply annoying. The two stars I did gave ""no Way Out"" are only due to of a few listenable guest appearences on the album. I hate to think that a younger generartion, never having heard N.W.A. or it's artists ,thinks this is where rap started."
1,too bad there is no 0 star,"Can somebody either shoot him or send him to North Pole or something... He is false representing Hip-Hop with his uncreative lyrics and beat biting; he is a horrible dancer as well (i must mention) Buffy, stop stealing other's beats... and oh, writing your own lyrics helps too. YOU SUCK ! Please, don't buy this CD...this is a CD with bunch of BS songs put together... looking for tru hiphop, go get yourself the new Roots album or any KRS-one classic album... anything but Buff Mommy"
2,Puffy!! Sit Yo a** down boy!! U can't rap!! Brotha!!,"""Young G's"" cool beat, wacked verses by Puffy and Jay-Z, the 2 worst rappers 2 grab hta mic. Butt tha songz wit Biggie and Kim iz the only reason your album didn't cope a 1. Sorry Puff, U, Mase, and defentaly The Lox R all totally wacked!! Butt Faith iz the most gorgeous thing i have ever seen!! She iz so beautifull!!!"
3,"ok cd, but could be more original","all of you who are dissing this cd, you gotta admit that this cd is pretty good. ill be missing you is a good tribute to big, even if puff copied the song by sting. some other tracks are pretty sick too, like victory, senorita, and cant nobody hold me down. i would have given this cd at least 4 stars if it wasnt for the unoriginality of puff's lyrics and beats"
1,"if ever there was a 0-star album, this is it","if you have common sense and a life, and you know what real hip-hop is,then do not buy this piece of $#!+. about te only thing it's good for is a coaster."
1,YO PUFF STICK TO PRODUCING!!!!!!!,"I WILL ADMITT THAT PUFF DADDY IS A DOPE PRODUCER AND HE FOUND A GREAT RAPPER IN BIGGIE SMALLS BUT HE SOUNDS SO BAD WHEN HE RAPS ON RECORDS. HIS LYRICS ARE WEAK AND HIS FLOW IS WEAK AND THE ONLY GOOD SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS ""I GOT THE POWER"" AND HE DON'T EVEN RAP ON IT. PUFF DADDY APEARS ON OTHER PEOPLES VIDEOS WHICH HE DON'T EVEN RAP ON AND TAKES THE CREDIT FOR THEIR SUCCESS DRE WOULDN'T DO THAT!"
2,i can't believe I loved this CD in 9th grade,"I used to love this CD and once I found out all his beats were ripped off of r&b and rap classics from the 80's after listening to old school nights on the r&b/urban radio, I gave this CD away cause he's making money off recycling older beats. The only thing that is relevant about this CD is memories from my high school days and enjoying the music while it was hot but in the end it's just recycled music, just like every other hip hop artist is doing today thanks to p diddy and his bad boy cult leading to ruff ryders and murda inc and all of that mess."
4,GUILTY PLEASURE,"Puff Daddy couldn't rap back then, and he really can't now either, but SOMEBODY bought this record. Back in 1997, you weren't even considered real if you didn't bankhead bounce to ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"", sing along to Big's (as well as Mase's and Puff's) lyrics in ""Been Around the World"", or ""throw ya' hands up"" (like Busta said) in ""It's All About the Benjamins"". And don't front on the gangsta tracks like ""I Got the Power"" with The Lox and ""Young G's"" with Jay-Z and Big. In the latter song, Puff proved why we don't buy his albums expecting dope rhymes from him (""...nice cars, nice b's and rings/Guess it's safe to say a n like me got nice things""). We instead bought No Way Out expecting a party, and this album rocked many a frat house back then.So what were you doing when this album came out? Hating Puff for beat-jacking and weak rhyming or running to the dance floor whenever one of his songs came on? You did both? Me too."
1,There is no way out of having zero skills,"Puff Flabby can buy artists, can buy girlfriends, but he can't buy skills"
1,No respect for unoriginality.,"This guy is making rap look insincere and altogether bad. Sure, he may have hit records.....but why should he not?.....the songs he STEALS were hits to begin with by the original artists. He raps to a song and calls it his own creation. What unoriginal bulls**t. I recommend if you want REAL ORIGINAL rap, to check out any 2PAC album or the new Public Enemy (There's a Poison Goin' On"")."
1,Hey 'Puffy': try to write on your own!,I don't like that he is rich 'cause Sting knows how to write a song
5,PUFF DADDY IS FINE,WHEN IT COMES TO MEN YOU ARE ALLWAYS ON MY LIST. I THINK THAT YOU ARE GOD'S GIFTAND THAT GOD HAS DEFINATELY BLESSED YOU IN MANY WAYS.
2,You wanna a real rap album??? Get DMX or 2pac not this sh*t.,2pac is the greatest and DMX is one of the best and Puff Daddy is a good producer but a bad rapper.
1,Puff Daddy Is As Weak As They Come,"The worst result of Notorious B.I.G.'s death is that it somehow gave Puff Daddy the notion that he needed to move centerstage. Let's say this right up front: Puff Daddy CAN NOT rap! And his wiggidy-whack production ""skills"" mainly consist of ripping off other people's songs lock, stock and barrel. And since when was ""Every Breath You Take"" a funky jam anyway? Puffy's probably the weakest rapper to ever hit it big, and that includes MC Hammer. In fact, Puffy resembles a modern-day Hammer, from his utter lack of original ideas right down to his parachute pants. In ten years, he'll be thought of exactly like we do Hammer now -- as an inexplicable explosion of shoddy hip-hop that somehow managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes for a couple of years. This is the absolute worst. If I could rank it less than 1 star, I surely would."
1,Puff Daddy is such an un-original biter,"In my opinion i think this ""Puff Daddy"" is a person that cant do anything for himself so he takes others creations. Now isnt rap or hip-hop supposed to be about originality and comin with the best beats and tight verses, well that isnt the deal with this man. the only thing that adds anything to this cd is B.I.G. rappin over a few songs. I think this cd takes away from the whole idea of rap, or even music in general. Maybe doin a remake of 1 or maybe 2 songs would be cool, but this is realy overdoing it. I also think when he had the static with Tupac, puff and bad boy just got torn apart by the great Makaveli and his crew the Outlawz. Dont even take a look at this redone, bittin, replay, poor excuse for an album. (R.I.P. Makaveli)"
1,NO TALENT!,"the only thing that amuses me about ""puff daddy"" is the way he steals other peoples' music."
1,Worst album ever,"Puff Daddy is a non-creative fool. Bad production, bad everything. Very morbid album."
3,dark album then and now,"puff never could rap thank god he had help from mase, big, kim, and busta rhymes on here anyway the album cover is dark you got puff, mase, the lox, and black rob dressed like they at a funeral on the front and then you have biggie on the back standing by a herst really dark message then this album was relerased the year big died along with life after death."
1,...,"What gave Puffy the idea he could rap? He's an ok producer, though he's far from being creative. Lyrically, he's fooling himself if he thinks he makes a good rapper. He has a weak flow, and relies on guest artists to carry him through his songs. The beats on this cd are weak, he really needs to step away from the music industry for awhile, and learn how to create music that brings something new, instead of just trying to cash in on the fads of the moment. My advice, forget this CD was ever made. And to all the people who think this is the 'best rap album ever' wake up and try listening to a real emcee, like MC Ren or Hutch. To wrap it up, this CD is a waste of money, plain and simple."
4,Not as good as reviews say,"P.Diddys debut album is considered a classic and with all the hits on it i do consider it a classic, however with that said this cd is not all that great.With the exception of all the singles on this LP it is not very good however all the songs are still listenable"
2,"Puffy, Why Cant you write your own songs?","This CD is not as bad as I had remembered, but his CD's only get worse. The reason this CD is decent is because most of it had a lot help from Notorious BIG. The later releases of P-Diddy show that he is a very weak rapper without his homeboy. As for his homey Mase, thank God he is out of the game. If you look in the credits, the only good song that Sean Combs wrote mostly on his own is ""Can't Nobody Hold me Down,"" and how good is that song if you think about it? Do not buy this new, cause you can find this CD and about twenty more in a used record bin."
5,"Its a tight CD, I have it and I listen to it about everday","The Cd was phat. That was an off the hook CD. Puffy, Mase and the crew no what they doing. I will by all there Cd's I also have Harlem World thats a tight Cd also."
4,According to Forbes magazine.....,"Puffy made 52 million in 1998. Gee I wish I couldn't rap, sing, dance or produce. I'd be a millionaire. Get real all you haters. All rappers ever sing about is money, and cars anyway so it's no surprised they are jealous of his sucess while they pump out ghetto tunes that don't sell."
2,Mixed Bag,"There are a few absolutely awesome tracks on this album, there are a few decent tracks, and there are a bunch of [bad] ones. You're better off just downloading ""Victory,"" ""All About the Benjamins,"" and maybe ""Been Around the World"" and ""Can't Nobody Hold Me Down"" ... I would highly recommend those songs because they do feature some incredible, mind-blowing rhymes. Other than them, there really isn't much else here so don't waste your money."
2,Not much to say about this one.,"There are a few good tracks on here, but after a while they just get boring. I am more of a west coast rap fan to begin with, but I gave this a try, and I'll have to say unless you like Puffy's style you can avoid this CD."
1,No Way Out by Puff Daddy,"this isn't kris okay this is his younger brother, john and first off i would like to make a review myself on the artist puff daddy. the cd is okay. the songs that have Foxy Brown & Lil' Kim in them are gonna be hot of course, but he doesn't rap good. everybody that he has on his songs out perform him and what gets me the most mad is that kelly price sings almost every single hook and yet does she get any credit? no, what happened here puff?"
1,DO YOU REALLY KNOW HOW TO RAP??,"i bought puffy's tape, but i regreted!! i wonder if he really knows how to rap, instead of doing those ""un huh, what, ya..."" in the back! for real, the best song in the album is ""missing you""....the lyrics are touched, but not the music...'cuz that's not your idea! i don't want to say the truth....but i can't stand someone who can't rap and still make those Gs. If Pac and Biggie were here, you wouldn't be what you are today, so you'd thank them for dieing! oh,one more thing! in Ebony magazine, you said you are not ready for marriage, but why did you have kids w/ your girlfried? don't be that selfish since you gets rich. you named yourself puff ""Daddy"", so be a real man, be a real Daddy!!!! oh, last thing, if anyone haven't bought his album, i will glad to give it to you!"
1,buffy,"sean ""Buffy"" combs is nothing. this cd is not his. every song on it is someone elses. he has no talent. he cant write his own song. just like the rest of bad boy. NOW THAT 2PAC IS GONE BUFFY AND THE BAD BOY FAM ARE TRYING TO TAKE OVER. BUT IN THE WORDS OF PAC ""N***** TALK A LOT OF S***, BUT THATS AFTER IM GONE, CUZ THEY FEAR ME IN THE VISIBLE FORM"" AND THAT IS TRUE. WITH PAC BEING GONE PUFFY IS TRYING TO MAKE HIS COME UP. HE COULDNT TRY WAS PAC WAS AROUND BECAUSE HE KNEW IT WOULDNT HAPPEN. EAST COAST IS SOFT, SO IF BUFFY, PIGGIE SMALLS AND THE OTHERS."
2,If it wasnt 4,Big and Jay-Z It wouldnt be any stars because that song is hot but the other radio played tracks are good but not great dont let the hype fool you dont buy.
1,"""No Way Out"": A Musical Mess","What do get when you rip off old 80's songs and add some bad rap lyrics over them? You get Puff Daddy's ""No Way Out"" . Its sad that Puffy's rap music is being preferred over the music of such talented rap acts as A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. Honestly, who wants to listen to Grandmaster Flash's ""The Message"" become poorly reworked again? What may steam hip hop fans the most is how Puff Daddy makes it look like rappers are in it just for the money (see ""It's All About The Benjamins"") and that all rappers are good for is boasting about how much money they have & how many cars they own. What also is annoying is how he can hold a negative ""ballin' gangster"" persona one minute and the next be a supporter of anti-violence and positivity. To sum it all up: no originality, no skills, & no hope."
1,Negative 5 stars,GARBAGE... I only came across this CD because my roommate played it. Just about every beat is sampled off of a well known first time hit. Puffy wants to make money. That's all there is to it. The reason he mumbles is so ALL we can hear is the snappy beat. If you buy this CD you are supporting the end of rap music as we know it. True hip hop fans would not let this garbage anywhere near the turntable. Fluffy is without a doubt the worst thing to happen to music EVER... without a doubt. (I cannot overstate how bad this 'music' is)
1,WITHOUT THE FAMILY THERE IS NO PUFF DADDY.,"PUFFY DADDY WITHOUT PEOPLE LIKE FAITH, MASE ETC YOU ARE NOTHING"
1,WEAK/WACK/FEEBLE/TRASH,"Listening to this album will make you wish that 2pac and Biggie were still alive. Hip Hoppers, we have go to be more selective and not let bullsh-t like this slide for rap!El-715"
1,"Umm, can u say BITER?","PD really s**** hard. Every one of his songs with the exception of one contains a sample of another song, or totally rehashed. PD isn't a rapper at all. He just wants to switch lyrics around on old 80's songs and turn them into cash. The only reason I bought this is because I actually liked that BIG dedication. Even that was rehashed. I warn you, if you buy this, you'll hate it in 1 week. I've had this CD for 11 months. Haven't listened to it in 10. If u want a some good rap CDs, get the 2Pac/Makaveli ones and Ice Cube CDs."
1,"This should just be ""& the family""","Puffy's new album is really (and I know I'm not the first to say this) pathetic. His ""family"" provides the only real enjoyment. Without them there wouldn't Puff would be out on the street. His solos blow big time. He's lucky he has the CA$H or he couldn't afford to pay royalties. (Then Sting would be on welfare) The only thing worse than this would be an Puffy Daddy CD composed of original songs. Spend your dough on a good album like BIG WILLIE STYLES. Hope I never end up with a disc this bad again."
5,Puffy is the S$?t. I like his new single with jimmy page,"Hi, Me and my friends have all had the CD now for over a year. It's still in the top three for us. I can't wait for the new one to come out."
1,"If I Could Give It No Stars, I Would","Puffy is a joke. His music is as weak as his name. True heads realize this, and the rest of you need to do your homework regarding hip-hop music and culture. Puffy is a rip-off artist, and this album proves it. Those of us who know the music that preceded hip-hop recognize over half of his beats. His lyrics are rooted in your generic ""Get Money""-type babble. How much dough do you think he made selling stupid people a song called ""Mo Money, Mo Problems""? Puffy's a businessman, not an artist. Wake up and smell the capitalism."
3,ok cd,"its a good cd, i guess, 1 of my worst cd's but its still not that bad but it only has bout 4 or 5 good tracks. there r too many samples also. but tha good songs r on mtv or tha radio or wutever all tha time so i barely listen 2 tha cd nemore but its an ok cd."
1,bad cd,"This cd best describes the word sh**, never before have I heard such annoying songs as the so-called all original songs on this album. Yea it's too bad piggie had to die, but you just can't rip off every 80's song in the book, no thought or lyrics went into this, mabey you can take a few samples from other songs but you can't take the entire songs (including the lyrics.) Puffy just made money and fame of BIG's death, and everybody sayin puffy is so great. And puffy means ""puff"" as in smoke as in canibus and so on... parents like his music,(take a guess why.) Puffy may have had 1997 but his time has passed. Please don't promote ""puffy"" by buying this cd."
1,One of the worst albums ever!,"Puff Daddy needs to makes his own music. Just about every song is unoriginal, and the originals are terrible. The album lack creativity and originality. Everyone thinks he's so great because he worked with Biggie, but he's nothing but a horrible musician."
1,The Most Unoriginal Album Ever,"""No Way Out"" was a terrible album. Every song on the album has a sample from a classic song from the 80's. This album ruined those particular songs. It features ""candy-coated-- *"" type of rhymes as The RZA quoted on ""Wu-Tang Forever."" So if you want to listen to real rap, not just cheap rhymes by a ""no skills"" rapper to ten year old beats, pick up a Gravediggaz or a Wu-Tang Clan album."
5,JOINT IS BANGIN''',First of all!!! All you Playa Haters need to stop hatin' and start congratulatin'. Sean Combs has business strategies and street smarts which is a good combo. That's why he is successful at what he does. So don't hate!!!!
3,"Great songs, great versus, thoughtful, but unoriginal","Puff Daddy, ""No Way Out"" is a fairly good CD, with some good songs. Been Around the World, Can't nobody Hold me down, and I'll be Missin' You are my favorites. The others are just normal rap songs, nothing special. The rest get kind of boring listening to. There are other soundtracks that are better. (Such as Good Will Hunting!!!)"
2,TOO MANY SAMPLES,"Can he write his own music? RZA blows him out of the water. He can only sample stuff others have used before. Everyone of his ""good"" songs and Biggie's songs are sampled."
1,Terrible role model for all the young listeners.,"I'm only a teenager, but I know well enough to judge this CD according to what it says. The young people in the country should not be subject to such explicit wording. The lyrics have way too many swear words and set a terrible example to all young people as well as adults. DO NOT BUY IT OR LET YOUR CHILDREN LISTEN TO IT!!!!!!!! Puff Daddy has no respect for anyone else. The only song worth listening to on the entire album is ""I'll Be Missing You."" SERIOUSLY!!!!"
1,Severe Ear Problem (ask van gogh),"This entertainers album was so bad......just had to tear my ears off. This was a severe problem...must've have been a curse....maybe he's satan in disguise? Hope he doesnt try to hurt me in my sleep, heard his fans have enough problems with the sandman... Well anyway my keyboard is now bright red. DON'T WORRY its drying fast and i dont really mind cuz i like ""hot"" colors! (im a scorpio)p.s. hey sean are you related to ray combs? i see the similarity..... leave my ears alone"
1,too many samples,"how many sampled songs can you have in one album? go make some original music, puff"
1,very confusing................,how in the hell did puff doofy make his money?!?!?!?did he become the smartest pimp and sell mediocre rappers to the masses 10 at a time!?!?!?!?!?as for the umbrella holder............HAVE YOU NO SHAME???????????????????????????????
1,zero stars if possible,"I bought this album back in the day when I obviously didnt know what I was doing. Puffy, D.Puff, Diddy Puff, whatever his name is has absolutely no skills on the mic. He's the lamest rapper of all time. He should seriously stick to producing and I aint saying he's all that either. He's so rich no thanks to his rapping ability. Thank You"
1,the king of wackness,i wish he would stop ruining records that i grew up on.he can't rap the music is cheesy and is embarassing.how do so many bums today get record deals? not an ounce of originality in there pinky.playing over songs is not creative.where have the standards gone? he gets the most blame cuz he is the most influential rapper out there period.until folks stop all this endless sampling then puffy is there leader.a mind is a terrible thing to waste.
5,how can you not love this cd,"this cd has bigge,mase,lox,black rob evry one that has made a big inpact on rap/hip hop evry one shuld have this cd it has more then 3 classic songs on it. the rymez that bigge drops are hot.puff makes a big bang on hip hop charts with this.HOW CAN YOU PPL NOT LOVE THIS CD OH I KNOW HOW YOUR TOO MUCH INTO YOUR NEW HIP HOP THAT HAS NOTHING BUT GOOD BEATS.PARTY RAP LOL"
1,the worst album of 1997,"During a cross-country trip last year, my brother played this album in the car.... and after finishing (enduring, actually) the entirety of the album, I suppressed my urge to pull the cd player and throw it away... I thought to myself...my god, I thought MC Hammer was horrible enough, now this talentless hack who's only saving grace from total comparison is the almighty ""street cred."" is filling the void (that doesn't need filling actually) of hammer's deserved decline. Not a single song in this crap exhibited creativity and meaningful depth to it. Before you dismiss me as a rap music hater, I'd like to say that i enjoy listening to a tribe called quest, the roots, and de la soul... Now those 3 artists are making MUSIC.... Puff (fluff is more like it) daddy only recycles hits from the 80's and raps (godawful) about the usual stuff.... I advise buyers to stop plunking your hard-earned cash and get something else... anything but this stinking crap..."
1,biggest biter on earth,"puff daddy can't do anything-he can't rap, can't produce, doesn't have an original bone in his body, and justs stands there as though women are supposed to kowtow to him or something, whatever...he samples from other famous songs, talks over them and the general public calls that music? and i thought most rap music was already going downhill. and now he's in the news because he allegedly hit someone over the head with a bottle? what, puffy, did your agent finally realize you have no talent? i hope you go to jail so we can never listen to your pathetic excuse for music ever again."
2,THIS IS NOT RAP,"yo if yall wanna be jammin with the real stuff go out and buy some DMX or 2 pac. at least they can write their own songs. Oh yeah and puffy, STICK TO PRODUCING."
5,One of the hottest albums ever,Puff Daddy is one of the most talented people ever. He is someone who will be in this buisness for a long time. He definetly is superstar material
1,Terrible,"Weak, fluffy, hyped-up garbage. The beats are weak and the rhymes are weaker. The highlights of this album are the guest appearances, without question. If you made the mistake of purchasing this album all those years ago - good luck getting rid of it. Probably wouldn't even sell on eBay.Diddy is a great entertainer with great vision, he is just not a legitimate hip hop artist."
1,This is bad,"I only bought this album for one song- ""Friend""- because Foxy Brown my favorite rapper was on that track. Big mistake. The only good thing about the song was Foxy's verse. Senorita is decent, I liked the Spanish beat. The rest of the cd is very bad. For example, ""Pain"" is a terrible remake of Roberta Flack's 1973 song ""Jesse."" I have Roberta's Killing me Softly album on vinyl, and if you listen to the original, Puffy's version sounds terrible. Every song but the intro is sampled. And every song on the whole album is about making money, or getting women. It's tiresome. Save your money."
5,Hitohira no Jiyuu,"This song is pretty sad once you find out the story behind it. It seems that Takuro (the songwriter/GLAY member) had lost somebody very special in his life and is expressing his grief in this song. I think it's a very touching song, but best for just listening..not really something you'd dance to, not even slow dance. It's more of a listening song than rocking-to song, you know? But overall, I think it's a great song."
5,a good tv show,David Hasselhoff did a good job back in the day better then the remake of what they did before yea
5,Knight Rider season 3,"I really enjoyed watching these videos. I watched it every week when it was on TV, but it was great to see them again."
4,Great series. Well worth the purchase!,This was a great series and I feel that season 3 was the best of all 4. The show really hit its stride in this season. I only wish there was more in the way of special features. The only special feature on it is a bonus episode from season 4.
3,"Love the show, BUT...","I own every season and every season has at least one ""problem disc"" that has trouble playing (if it plays at all) in whatever DVD Player I put it in, even my computer. If it all worked it would have 5 stars."
3,"Knight Rider, Season 3","I had already purchased Seasons 1 & 2. What I especially like about this series is what KITT, the car, can do. There is a lot of action, and it is always different and with often unexpected results.This series takes a close second to the series called Airwolf, which I purchased some time ago."
5,"WOW, I think it's worth buying!!!","I bought this season coupple of days ago, and WOW, is all I haver to say. It seems like the shows are longer, better acting (well some scence), and I like the scenes where they had edited them in the tv broadcast.If you are a Knight Rider fan like mylself, then this should be in your collection!!!"
3,Knight of Dissapontment,"I was really looking forward to season 3 of knight rider of DVD.most of my favourite episodes are in this season,Sadly this is the most lamest transfer on to DVD #I have ever seen.I can accept that they had to replace 2 prince songs because of music rights.However what I can't except is the clumsy mess up with sound effects.Only 2 episodes in the entire set are as they should be.Kitt's engine sound is missing in places buttons sounds are also missing now and then.The really bad episode in this set is Knight of the chameleon it sounds a chase scene near the beginning sounds totally rubbish. No engine sound no tyre sound.For an official universal release this is really pathetic.I hope season 4 isn't messed up like this.A company like universal should not be making these mistakes in products."
1,gfhfh,I got a fake item. Only a some of the songs on the music sampler listing are on the CD the others are not there at all. I ordered for this CD collection because I loved a particular song; which unfortunately is not on the CD I received although it is displayed on the playlist as one of the compilation.But why display fake information? Returning the item is not necessarily a sensible option as it simply not worth the effort that includes time. A bit of honesty would go a long way. I would still purchase a CD from the same supplier if there is a way of telling them what I actually wanted; and they can deliver. Music is such an important item in life that it is dangerous for people who do not know what it means to deal with it.The lack of a channel to communicate with a supplier makes online purchases a risky business I am afraid!
1,Terrible collection.,"What a waste of money. I love Italo Disco, but this collection is a disgrace. In nine out of ten songs, the first five minutes of each song is monotonous beat, and, if you've suffered through these five minutes of beat, then the actual song begins. To the makers of this collection - empty beat has never been a part of Italo Disco. I wouldn't even label it as Italo Disco, but rather ""Empty beat with a little bit of song at the end""."
2,T H E___O N L Y___F R A G R A N C E___I___D O N ' T___L I K E,"I am very happy that another reviewer likes this perfume and that it reminds her of her mother. Love is always a wonderful thing....For me, however, this IS the only fragrance I've NEVER liked. It reminds me of a rather austere and detached-from-the-welfare-of-her- students school-teacher, or perhaps a VERY snobby rich girl. I guesstastes -- and noses! -- differ. All I can say is I feel very uncomfortable when smelling ths fragrance. Yes, it smells BETTER than rotten eggs -- but to me, not much. :(Sorry)"
2,Wow!! What happened,"What happened to the LOX. This album is not what I expected. What a horrible album. Only a few tracks is hot. The title track and the Yonkers intro are the only tracks hot. If you think I'm Jiggy and not to be f****d with are decent but the rest is nothing but lack of lyrics and used samples. Jadakiss can get down for his, Styles can rhyme a little something and Sheek needs improvement. The LOX can do better than this and their previous demos sounds different. This group went from the Warlocks being hardcore to The LOX being pretty boys with Puff. They are really kicking themselves in the rear end for not starting their careers with an album produced by the Ruff Ryders, introducing DMX and the other Ruff Ryder peoples."
1,The best track on the album is the intro.,"That statement sums up the entire album. ""Money, Power and Respect"" is a decent single, but only because of DMX and Lil' Kim. The album is one wack song after another. The person(s) who rated this a 5 star album must be on some sort of cheap drug, or they just don't listen to hip hop. Too many rappers nowadays are able to come correct on cameos, but when it comes to their own album they bomb ( ex: The Lox, DMX, Mase [sorta] )."
1,Waste of time,This album was horrible. I expected a lot from the Lox and what I got was bullsit. I ended up tossing this album in the trash.
3,"Different day, different rating","The problem with this album is youll change your mind about whether you like it everytime you listen to it. There are som good tracks, and some not so good ones. But theres no cruise to tracks or ones youll remember and want to play again and again. The lyrics are generally ok across the record, but at points are pretty wack. Beats are a bit repetitive but thats cus i dont really like em. Pretty much in keeping with the tradition of Bad Boy bein gay, but you might like it! what do i know anyway."
2,Same old Bad Boy,"Man, how can a hiphop-record get so bad. These cats have almost zero talent. But the record is still better than Puffy's ""No Way Out"" LP. It gets two stars. Nothing I would recommend anyone spending their money on, but they represent the better side of Bad Boy."
1,Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack!!!!!,"I hope to save everyone out there some time, and money. I'll be blunt, if you're looking for a shake your booty get down funky hip-hop Cd. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. If you're looking for a Hardcore beat-bumpin Bass droppin' lyrically gifted Cd... DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM. If you're looking for a nice shinny coaster for your Grandma's coffee table, YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM. I only wish there was a 0 stars option available because this Cd dosen't deserve one!!!!!!"
2,Double R,"Dont buy this album cop dat We are the Streets, da album on a label who aint given a F**K Double R."
3,"Not the best rap CD, but the best BAD BOY rap CD",This CD was alright. I'm sure The LOX's next album will be better since they're with Ruff Ryders now.
1,weakkkk!,despite going over to ruff ryders who are as terrible as puffy when it comes to that stuff they call music this group is weak.they have no flow or feeling in there work.puffy tried to give them character and they still stunk up the disc.and now with the way overrated ruff ryders production&crew it will get even worse.
3,Dual Message Stamp,"I really only needed a ""FRAGILE"" Stamp, but the price was tiny-! The Shipping cost was more than the stamp-! It works O.K., & I'm happy with it.Thanks, Amazon-!"
4,Pretty good,"Eleven-year-old Jessi Ramsey loves to dance. She makes a new friend, Mary. But soon Jessi notices some strange things about Mary. She starts getting thinner and thinner, and she's not eating. When she talks about it with her friends in the baby-sitters club, she finds out that Mary is anorexic. Jessi knows Mary is in danger. But if she tells someone, it could mean losing a friend. Read this book and find out what happens!"
3,preety good,"not the greatest but its ok...it all happens when jessi along with other students offer to help out with a free trial young children ballet class, it is then she takes notice on a girl, mary that she is getting thinner and her mum is commenting on how fat she is. Because of this Mary thinks she is fat and jessi along with the bsc realise she may hae a eating disorder because she has all the symptons. Jessi trys to tell Mary but she ignores her remarks. What will happen to Mary? Its up to Jessi and Mme Noelle to save her life."
4,Beck on Guitar,"The Yardbirds showcased three of the greatest guitarists of all time: Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, and Jimmy Page. This collection of music with Jeff Beck is well done. The sound quality is great and the songs are too. This is a great record for for anyone interested in the Yardbirds or just great blues."
1,Pointless if your cat has its nails,"In theory it's a great idea, but in reality it's pointless. My cat scratched the hell out of it when he went to cover his mess. When I went to lift it up, all the liter came falling back into the box. So, I have these extra bags lying around. If your cats nails are trimmed or if had them declawed it would probably make more sense to use them."
1,Liners are not good...,"I have had two Booda Cleanstep litter boxes over several years. The litter box is wonderful and I would recommend to anyone. However it is very frustrating finding liners to fit the box. I have been ordering the ones recommended, but found I have to use 2 every time I change the litter. The bags do not fit well and they are very thin. My cat does not have front claws, but still manages to tear the bags. Also, it's impossible to find the Booda liners with cleanstep in the stores. I'm still on the hunt for better liners."
3,a lot better than nothing,"even though I have a smaller booda dome, I need the jumbo liner because the cat scratches very vigourously and the smaller liner ends up not covering the bottom. Unfortunately it is hard to find the liners. In my area four separate Petco stores sent me on a wild goose chase involving lots of time and gas money. They would call ahead, the store would say they had the liner, and when I got there, they didn't. All these stores actually sold booda domes. Unfortunately also most web sites don't realize there are different sizes. I just got through visiting five sites and could not tell whether the liners they were offering were jumbo or not. I think it's a fine product, the lower rating is just for the limited availability. Amazon only has one in stock of the right size, so it's not worth getting with the shipping. I will have to keep looking."
5,cat box liners,"Got them very quickly and they worked well for me. Petsmart, where I bought the cat box didn't carry the liners anymore for the box, so I was releived that Amazon did."
1,There's only one word to describe these...,"TERRIBLE! The fit is terrible. The bag is so thin that it tears with the slightest provocation. There are only 8 in the bag and you pretty much have to use two at a time. Did I mention that it doesn't even fit right, even though it claims to be made by Booda?!? What a mess and a huge disappointment."
1,"Weak, don't fit","While the Booda cat litter dome is fine, the liners are awful, and will prevent me from buying another Booda dome. I don't know if these guys are trying to keep their profits up, or what, but they should pay the extra .01 cents per liner and make a liner that fits and that can hold the amount of litter that fits in the dome without breaking when you pick it up."
3,Boodle Box liners,"The liners are very much like trash bag liners - nothing special. However, they do not split open the way some customers have said!"
3,Good for a cat that doesn't enjoy tearing things up.,"This product would be wonderful for a pet that doesn't tear things like plastic bags. Or if you're going to change out the entire litter box every other day. I think it may have lasted three days. I scoop the box every day, but by the third day or so I knew I might as well not have put one in the box. It is, however, what was advertised and I don't fault it in any way for what was said."
1,"Great idea, but doesn't work","We purchased the litterbox at a local petstore and ordered extra liners on Amazon. Seller is great, however the product itself the cat HATES. He rips the plastic apart and it shifts all over the place, leaving litter everywhere inside and outside the box. We've opted for the old litter in the box, dump, and wash method. It's easier, in our opinion. Now little bits of plastic aren't all over the place."
1,Garbage!,"Way too flimsy. These things are really, really thin, and your cat WILL claw through them. Unfortunately due to the weird design of the Dome, these are the only bags I've found that fit halfway decently."
5,Booda Dome Liners Finally Found!,"Sadly I went searching for these liners in PetSmart & Petco and neither had them. I found them online and am very glad because I used a garbage bag and cut it to fit the Dome and that DID NOT work out. Even though our cat tends to wind up poking small holes in the bottom when he digs too deep, I feel the product is good to use based on it's size and I can easily clean up the mess left from transferring litter using my vacuum."
1,Don't fit,"Not only do they not fit the Booda dome very well, the cat destroys them when she tries to cover her poop."
5,Liners are Great,"Litter box cleaning is much better using the liners. It is easy to put liners in, scoop the litter and dispose of them"
1,Poor Design,These Booda Dome liners do not even fit into the round base ! So what happens is that there is excessive baggie that you cannot smooth out that eventually the cats scratch to bits and smithereens! Do not waste money on these bags .... the design is poor and they do not work well at all. Very dissapointed.
2,It's a cat box not a limited edition car!!,"We have three cats which use the dome box, one of which is a huge mane coon, and it's great. We have no more accidents with him because he can actually fit into the box with no trouble. For a couple of weeks after we bought it we were fine, and then we started having problems finding the stupid liners!! The Booda people are a bunch of idiots simply because of the fact that you know what??? It's a cat box, people aren't going to replace these every year like they do cars!! I'd be a lot happier with this product if I could actually find it."
2,Not Worth the Price,"I paid over $170 dollars for a paperback book that I will only use for one semester. The information presented in the book is soley common knowledge that any reasonable person would already know. Do We really need to know that managers have to make decisions, or that they must plan?The study of management is important for those wanting to work for a business or own and operate their own, but I don't belive this book has brought me any closer to giving me the skills and knowledge to own and run my own business."
2,not what I ordered.,"The item came on time but was not the item I ordered. I did receive a Cleveland Brown's 2x3 banner, but it was not the one shown in the picture.I'm not sure if there was a mistake in the shipping process or if the website has the incorrect picture, so be weary if you are picky and only want the banner with the brown's elf on it. I received a banner with the same brown base but it had the Cleveland Brown's helmet on it instead of the elf. Luckily I'm not too picky so I'm not going to bother to send it back."
5,Really Cute and Unique!,"These little riding boot ornaments are adorable! The colors and true to the photo, and they are well-made and the ideal size to hang on the tree."
4,I like this book !,"It about first time of New York City's Police man, I like the story that the author told in the book very much."
3,Good for the price,"Could be sturdier, you need to apply some good downward pressure to keep the grater stable. Metal is a little thin and flexes easily."
3,"A bit big, not so sharp","It grates cheese fairly well, the blades aren't so sharp but what it's really good as is taking up a whacking great chunk of my closet space."
2,Sent a cheap Chinese knockoff of Traex grater in product photo December 2012,"The photo is of a Traex Stainless Steel 4 Side SG-200 Drip Grater which is sold on Amazon for $17.11. The Traex is a very high quality grater. The Traex brand will be stamped with the word Traex or Dripcut or possibly Volrath. (Mine is stamped Dripcut, although the ""t"" in the stamp is very faint.) I have owned one of the Traex graters for about 15 years and used it hundreds of times. It is a wonderful product.I wanted to give one to each of my daughters and in December 2012 ordered this item based on the photo. What I received is not what is pictured. The grips on the ones I was sent were square not ovoid. The build quality of what I was sent is very flimsy and the graters were somewhat bent out of shape went I received them. My 15 year old Traex is as square as the day I bought it.Maybe okay for the price but you won't get the high quality grater shown in the photo."
4,great grater!,"I wanted a simple, sturdy box grater without the rolled bottom. This fit the bill. The top edge is a little unfriendly - wish it had a thicker top or padded grips, but overall it's great"
4,It does the job,This is a solid cheese grater that will not fall apart on you. I have had many other kinds and they all broke. I recommend this product.
2,Terrible tool for tough veggies,"The main reason why this grater was purchased is the absence of the rubber base. However, the angles and the design makes it very difficult to grate carrots and even cucumbers to the appropriate form. Perhaps it can work better for cheese but not for tougher vegetables.Also, the design is kind of cheap. I'd go with something else."
3,book has very simple modles,this has very simple modles. It is good for the beginer. The paper comes in many colors.
3,Not as easy as it looks,"I thought it would be fun to do some origami, but it is hard to figure out the instructions for a beginner. The easy part of the title was lost on me. I ended up with a butterfly that actually looked like a road kill frog. Oh well, I guess this just isn't for me. Other's may enjoy this paper kraft."
5,great projects,I got this for our younger son. He really likes making and building things. He really liked this and still uses it.
2,Just okay. Could be better.,"I got what I wanted for my daughter in terms of size and color. The quality isn't great. The zipper malfuntions frequently and has since she opened it. The slots to store games are a pretty tight fit, but ultimately we can get games in 2 out of 3 slots. I guess for what I paid and what was available in the stores it was satisfactory."
1,Junk,"The first one failed, didn't read DVDs and would not eject. I sent it back in under warranty and the replacement did the same thing. What a junker. I've had all kinds of Onkyo equipment in the past and it was all top quality. Not this piece."
2,not the usual onkyo quality,i bought this player on 12-27-02. ive returned it 3 times to circuit city. the audio occasioally drags badly. all 3. i love onkyo products and have had good luck with all except this model.
1,Wish I'd Read These Reviews 18 Months Ago!,"You can add my name to the list of ""victims"" on this product! I also bought this DVD Player 18 months ago as part of a Home Theater system which included the Onkyo TX SR600 Receiver/Amp and the fantastic Bose Acoustamass 15 speakers. No complaints on the receiver or speakers, but the DVD player started acting up after 12 months and has now just quit altogether. It lights up but can't get the drawer to open. I found all of these negative reviews while researching a replacement, which I guarantee will NOT be another Onkyo."
1,Poor Poor Poor Quality & Worse Support,"Let me start by saying if I could rate this product ZERO stars I would have. I bought the Onkyo DV-C600 6 disc changer for myself and the newer version for my dad a year later. Little did I know this product is of the poorest quality. Within 2 years my DVD player [died] on me and less than a year after that it's now completely fried. My father's situation is much worse. His player died a year after he owned and Onkyo refused to repair it. I also own an Onkyo tuner, which [died] after a year and half, they repaired it and figers crossed it hasn't broken yet. I'm 3 for 3 on defective equipment so be warned DO NOT BUY ONKYO unless you want POOR POOR POOR QUALITY AND WORSE SERVICE/SUPPORT!!!"
2,More Problems,"I agree, it locks up on DVDs and CDs and I only use store purchased/rented ones. The tray movement is loud, inconsistent, and slow. I have owned it for almost one year and I have become very frustrated with the quirks. I would not recommend this model at any price."
1,Painfully Slow,"This DVD Changer [is unacceptable]! It's slow to react. You'll sit there for 5 seconds and wonder did the batteries go in the remote...well no they didn't--the CP500 is just SLOW! This player gets confused when CDs and mixed in with DVDs. So be ready to babysit it and have the desire to slap it when it doesn't do what you request. Overall it's not user-friendly. This is NOT what you would expect from Onkyo. I previously owned a Kenwood CD changer and a single Toshiba DVD player, and everytime I use this piece of plastic I wish I never ""upgraded."""
4,Awesome praise and worship CD,"""One Thing"" is the main reason I bought this CD, but I was pleasantly surprised by the rest. Marvin Sapp is truly annointed. With each new release he goes higher and higher. He really knows how to usher you into the presence of God."
5,YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM!!,"If you are in search of anointed praise & worship, this album will not disappoint. I cannot stop playing the album over and over again -- nos. 9, 10, 4 and 1 are AWESOME!! If you are a worshipper, please get this album.Be blessed."
5,"ABSOLUTELY A ""MUST HAVE"" CD!","This CD is absolutely, without-a-shadow-of-a-doubt, a must have cd! I am speechless and in complete amazement at how anointed this cd is! If you are desiring to feel the presence of the Most High through praise and worship, then it is a requirement for you to purchase this cd! ..."
3,o.k.,i have been aware of marvin since 94 when he came aboard commissioned - he has serious vocals! i liked his first 2 albums best. this one is ok...3 stars because he can really sing.
5,Great Preparation,"As a former second grade teacher, I found this book an excellent preparation for second graders. There are many concepts and skills that are normally taught in late first grade or in second grade. The pages are well presented and have a fun element to them. The book would be appropriate to use throughout the second grade year as some of the sections may be somewhat difficult for before the school year starts. I bought it for a child who will start second grade this year and he loved it. His comment was that it was ""pretty easy""."
5,Excellent study of both AI and Common Lisp,"I have no background in computer science or AI, but found myself needing to use Lisp for various creative and artistic purposes. I've spent a lot of money on books relating to Common Lisp, but I wish I had just gotten this one and Touretzky's ""Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation."" The particular strengths of this book are its detailed discussion of advanced topics, especially optimization, and the practical overview of current and historical AI topics through programming examples. Very clearly written."
3,Buy this one last!,"Probably the weakest of the Elijah's Mantle albums.These are all older songs which have been reworkedto be played live; somehow in the reworking, thepassion and emotion are mostly lost. While stillmuch better than watching an hour of tv, I'd sayif you're building an Elijah's Mantle collection,buy this one last."
5,One of the greatest albums ever,I've had this album for over 10 years; and it's certainly a classic. I love each and every song on this album; even the interludes blow me away.I still listen to it and it never gets old...I love it just as much as I did back then; if not more. This is one of the few albums that I can listen to every song without skipping to the next. Love it!
4,Takes me back to when R&B was good,"Faith Evans, 1995 debut Faith was released in the fall of my eigth grade year. I remeber the first time I heard Soon As I Get Home and instantley liked this song. The Aaron Hall featured remix was even better, the other single from the disc You Used To Love Me was a classy chilled out number. Evans builds on a basic, hip-hop-influenced funk, alternating between simmering grooves and sultry ballads making the album is a first-class debut."
4,Alright album,"This album had one made over song with mary J Blige and it was a great album to kick back to like Soon as I get home, ain't nobody, are my favorites too."
4,This is the best of alll her cd's,"I love this cd, she was making her way into the music world and her music spoke the truth!This cd shows her rreal vocal talent and her great writing skills. IIt's a soothing cd and I can't stop playing it."
5,"One word: ""Reasons""","That one song is the most stellar on the album, but there are several noteworthy songs. Buy it."
4,Classic Faith...,"she does it again. All is fair in love and you never get tired of knowing someone shares the same feelings about love, or the lack thereof, as you do.In the same spirit as her debut album, Faith let's us know we need to keep up the faith and not give up on love because when you have it, it's a beautful thing and just the memory of it can make you thankful!Go 'head, Ma!"
4,Best of Faith!,"What do you get when you come across a milder version of Mary J. Blige, and a more natural version of Whitney Houston? The result is one of the most influential R&B singers of the 90's. Although her lyrics aren't as prolific or convincing as Mary J, and her voice is a lot tamer than Whitney's, Faith Evans does more than prove that she can hold her own ground on this impressive debut album. Standout tracks are ""Aint Nobody"", ""Love don't Live Here Anymore"" with Mary J. Blige, ""Soon As I Get Home, and a few others. While it certainly has some boring moments, this album makes Faith Evans a serious singer to be reckoned with.El-715"
5,Great Toy To Stimulate Imagination!,"My 2 year old received this for Christmas this year and he also received an oven set. He would much rather play with the portable ""grill"". He loves putting on the oven mitt, and mixing up the food. The wooden pot and pan will stand up through many play dates! Believe me! Melissa and Doug products are exceptional."
5,like George? yes? So you must buy this book!,"Very good biography from george harrison. I believe george's fans should read this and ""I me mine"" too.I, Me, Mine"
1,Jack of all Trades - Master of none,"Aaron Leitch's book is interesting, but it deserves not more then 1 starts! The author seams to be a Jack of all Trades, but master of NONE - involved with Middle Eastern Religion and Mythology, Shamanism, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism and Alchemy, Traditional Wicca and Neopaganism, The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, Thelema, Angelology, Qabalah, Enochiana, Psychology and Consciousness Expansion, Cyberspace, and Modern Social Commentary. Evocation and Ceremonial Magic are not salon-games or past times, but serious operations. Even the suggestion that each student has to alter the work implies less knowledge then expected from any author of this genre! His Wiccan and Neo-Pagan roots truly show in this work. Thumbs down all together!"
1,Incoherent,"I regret the time and money expended in acquiring the following information. In no way can I recommend this book to any reader.This work is incoherent and reflects the incoherence of the design of the MathLie Mathematica Package. The text is neither an adequate introduction to the package nor a suitable reference. Descriptions of functions are locally incomplete and globally scattered throughout the book. Only after considerable searching does one find that, in fact, there is little functionality for the solution of any but the most trivial systems.As a tool to learn applications of Lie Groups to Differential Equations, this text is useful only insofar as it represents the thinnest introduction to the material, suitable neither for the expert nor the novice.As a tool to expand the capabilities of Mathematica, it is a pointless exercise in using essentially undocumented encrypted code with no evident organizational principle. One may well do better to seek help from a divining rod."
4,"Read a Little, learn a lot","The author presents a well-researched, and well supportedcritical work. If this book does nothing else, perhaps itwill make people read more critically, and always search forthe Bible's true meanings, not the ones THEY want to insert."
3,"Not Bad, But definately not great.","Approximately half the songs on this album are decent, and a handful of them good ( ""24 hrs to live"" springs to mind ). I don't know why I see so many 5 star ratings, The lyrics aren't that good ( sometimes they're downright horrid! ). On my first listen through the album, I was able to name about 7 of the umpteen samples used. Typical PD production."
5,A Great CD!,"The only problem is the last song. I think Mase sounds bad in that song(I guess he can't sing, just rap). Otherwise I think this has REALLY good songs and is worth owning if you like Mase."
4,"I like Ma$e, He's all right","Yo mase is a good raper. He's different from the other rapers. He's calm, thats a good and bad thing."
1,Thankful He's saved,"I'm so thankful that Mase is now Pastor Mason Betha! He's now married and a great preacher. His ministry is S.A.N.E. ministries. You can go to his website and hear his preaching!It's nice to know that He gave his life to Christ and turned his life around! I wish more rappers would do the same! For the record, I meant 5 stars, not one! ;)"
1,Mase the Disgrace,"Am I the only one that thinks that Mase sounds like Forrest Gump on crack? Half the time you can't understand him. I think the music is bogus, enough with the sampling and no talent producing. Mase reminds me of my five year old neighbor, and he's got more skills! The only reason Mase sells, is because of surburban white girls and paid reviewers. ANd the funniest thing is, he tries to be hard on pop, kiddie beats. Mase, please don't show your face."
1,Weak weak weak weak lyrics!!,"Sometimes if the beats are too trendy or wack for me, I can still get past that if the lyrics hit my head. Maybe some wordplay or something that requires a little thinking. Not MA$E. All he's concerned about is money and women, and he will never rap about anything substantive. I know there will always be wack artists producing crap for the mainstream, but damn, puffy's making that all he puts out now. All you jokers out there in the suburbs buying this crap, please stop, it's gettin tough on those of us who define hip hop culture to get real music played. Just because a lot of people like something, doesn't mean it's good music. Need I mention ""ice ice baby""? I think MA$E is the modern day Vanilla Ice"
1,It's awful!!!,"This CD is just terrible. The only semi-decent song is ""feel so good"". thats probably why its the only one on the radio. he should quit his job!"
2,Mase is cool.,"Mase is cool because he raps real slow and slurs his lyrics. Also, he's never been arrested for ""nuttin domestic"". Most rappers like to brag about their rap sheets. Mase raps about the usual rap subjects: money, girls, his mercedes, and beating other mc's up. Lyrically it's like almost all rap except Mase doesn't constantly talk about smoking weed throughout the whole record."
3,Mase-Harlem World,"Wow, I used to own this album, I copped it the day it came out and I really like it. Then one day I lost it, all well. This album is aight and its ur typical diddy produced album also. Diddy uses so many old beats that it gets sickening, Mase really isnt that good when it comes to getting down on the mic, which is sad, also his voice gets annoying and things get too repetitive, sounds like another rapper I know?!?!?!? 50 Cent, You get What I'm saying. He is outshined by all of his special features which is very sad and disturbing. Anyways there are a few good tracks on this album, feels so good, looking at me, what u want, 24 hours to live, and cheat on you. So if ur a fan of Diddy and the Bad Boy family and ur used to hearing recycled beats on a 20 track album then go get this, u might not be dissapointed."
2,Harlem World,"This is one of the 1st rap albums that I bought, and I still toss it into the CD player every once in a while when I want a laugh or two. Honestly, I don't think that there was a lot of talent used in the creation of this album."
1,U GOT TO be KIDDIN ME!,"OH MAN! when i first got this CD I was in love with it! but now, the CDs that r in my CD player is Limp Bizkit and Blink 182 while Mase is in the case on my rack somewhere. I hate rap and rap all sounds the same anyway."
2,"More mediocre, tired rap","Although Puffy and his East Coast cohorts occasionally turn out a viable party track, this Mase album generally falls short -- Hip-Hop's vital energy and cutting-edge sound are almost totally absent, replaced by Mase's bored-sounding voice and money-obsessed lyrics. His boasting lacks even the ""Yeah-what's-up-now"" excitement of other self-promoting rappers like Ice Cube and B.I.G. This poppish album DOES pack three or four popular party tunes, but as a rap album for listening, it is just tired and dull."
3,ITS GOOD IF YOU LIKE A TWST OF R&B AND HIP HOP,MASE IS A GOOD RAPPER AND WORKS WITH MANY PEOPLE KEE UP THE GOOD WOR
3,SellOuts,"This is a pretty tight album for an inexperienced rapper such as Mase, but looking back at such rookie albums like 2Pac's ""2pacolypse Now"" and Jay-Z's ""Vol. 1"" it is pretty much nothing. It also lacks a significant blockbuster hit which most successful rap albums have. ""Feel So Good"" is the closest thing to this. Also, seeing all the Bad Boy MCs that feature on this Puff Daddy-produced album, it feels funny listening to this- almost as if Mase is just a sellout like the other Bad Boys. But that won't change his music.WeSt SiDe 4EVA !"
1,Maybe speech classes would help,"Ma$e is, in a word, horrible. He is basically, and everyone who isn't brain dead should know this, a way to make money, that is what Puffy (that panzy) saw in him. He is a sell out to rap and basically the whole Bad Boy label is. Mumblin' Mase should just move up to his big house on the hill and keep his mouth shut. ZERO STARS"
1,despicable,"Mase's whiny nasal voice is reminiscent of Puff Daddy's, which I noticed when it remained difficult to distinguish the two from each other after several listenings. After Puffy lost the man who wrote all his lyrics for him, Biggie, he quickly replaced him with Mase, and continues to steal beats and rhythms from elsewhere to rocket his artists to quick but short-lived 'fame'. Puff Daddy's habit of stealing songs has angered me repeatedly, and I don't think I will buy any more Bad Boy merchandise or listen to the radio when the songs are playing; it's like listening to the oldies station because old stuff keeps showing up. That idiot Puff Daddy just cannot stop sampling, sampling, sampling, sampling, and pretending he's something he's not."
5,Harlem World is tight,"Harlem World is a great cd. All the songs are awesome. My personal favorites are Will They Die 4 You and 24 Hours To Live. Mase isn't the best rapper ever, considering he slurs his words a little, but he's pretty good. This cd features great artists on almost every song. But don't worry, if you're the kinda person who buys a cd for it's main artist and not others, you'll still here A LOT of Mase. Most of his songs have fast beats that'll rise your spirits while some others have hard slow beats like Jay-Z's songs. I have to admit though, Mase has too many interludes. Whoever purchases this cd should enjoy it."
2,"Some good tracks, but overall, it's wack.","HARLEM WORLD, by Mase was a much anticipated album, and although I don't like Bad Boy, I enjoyed ""Feel So Good"". I bought this album and was so disappointed. Some tracks are okay{""Do You Wanna Get $"", ""Take What's Yours$Q}, some tracks were really good, like ""Will They Die 4 You?$Q, ""Feel So Good"", and ""The Player Way$Q, and some were terrible, like ""What You Want$Q, ""Love U So$Q, and ""Jealous Guys"", with 112 and Puff Daddy. Overall, this album isn't up to par. There is too much sampling, too many stupid interludes, and the guests weren't good{with the exception of Busta Rhymes, Eightball, MJG, Lil' Kim, DMX, & Jay-Z}. There were guest appearances from Puff Daddy, DMX, Lil' Kim, Billy Lawerence, Eightball, MJG, Busta Rhymes, Lil' Cease, Jay-Z, 112, Monifah, The Lox, and Black Rob."
5,Buy.,"It feels like Mase has lost his cache, which is a real shame, because this album is top-notch shtuff. Lasting appeal, and still relevant and better than most that's new."
4,MA$E. What Can I Say?,"I mean Ma$e killed it with this record. You can hate all you want because it is easy to hate on Ma$e and this whole 'Shiny Suit' point in hip hop history BUT there are some really sick tracks on this record even is Ma$e rhymes a bit S-L-O-W. Funny how now I would love to hear someone like Ma$e on the radio these days, funny how what was 'bad' back then doesn't seem so horrible now lol."
1,"High production value, zero lyrical talent","I'll give credit where credit is due -- the production value of this album is high, which is typical of this record label. There are your typical beats and samples which will be popular with the mainstream radiowave crowd. It feels polished and heavily produced, but the ""star"" of this charade is Ma$e, a talentless [singer] who's more or less the product of good timing or a good hook-up with the label/producer, because this guy is the biggest joke I've ever heard, and would *never* have gotten a deal if he had just walked in off the street to try and strike a deal. Nobody who claims to be a fan of rap or hip-hop should be able to say with a straight face that they like this waste of time. This genre's been going downhill ever since the pinnacle of Wu-Tang Clan's ""36 Chambers"". None of this Top 40 sewage even comes close to the unique and revitalizing sound of that album."
1,It wasnt good.,He is a poser and doesnt know anything. I bought the cd thinking it would be good but it sucked.
5,Nice Serving Bowl,I just love this serving bowl. I bought it to go with my Shadow Iris dinnerware. I really need to order one or two more because this bowl has proved to be invaluable for various uses in my kitchen. It's the perfect size for whipping eggs or mixing instant mashed potatoes for those hurried times. It's just the right size for tuna or egg salad and plastic wrap seems to cling to it pretty well. What's not to like there?
5,great value and quality,"Although these bowls do not have the Shadow Iris pattern, the green rim coordinates very well with the dishes. Just the right size to hold side dishes. I am planning to order more for use during our holiday dinners."
4,Super sexy,"I have about 15 CDs which have a collection of Bossa Nova hits and this album is my absolute favourite. In fact, this is the third time I am buying this particular Bossa Nova album. Someone pinched my earlier two. Do you need more convincing."
4,Rich content with helpful vocabulary help,"I bought this for my 3-year-old girl who's going to a French immersion preschool. She loves it! She likes it when I read to her (I speak pretty fluent French) and she can figure out things by looking at the pictures. E.g., when I read a sentence and ask her in French what a certain object is, she'd point to a picture. She also likes to hear the CD. The book is colorful. The pictures and the English translation for the scripts are very helpful. My 7-year-old boy who doesn't speak French also likes to read with us and he'd read the English and I do the French part. I can tell the book is appealing for kids no matter what language it's in. I give 4 stars because I think they could have done better on the recording with more animation and variety in the tone, etc."
3,Play and Learn is not very engaging,"I haven't been able to find something as entertaining as Learn in Your Car French for Kids (Marie and Robert going to the fete). The CD on Play and Learn is completely in French without any clever songs, stories, or activities that the kids can really follow along to. If they know a LOT of French then maybe it would be something they can follow along to, but it certainly doesn't teach anything using English/French together in an engaging way."
1,not a good purchase,"I bought this book to work with my grandchild who can speak some French, (I am French) and with his preschool class where I teach once a week.The songs are ok, but not very engaging. There are lots of spelling mistakes in the CD list of songs (a real turn off) and the lessons are not meant for beginners at all.Even though the accents on the songs are authentically French, the language isn't. ""un baiser tres grand de bonnes nuits"" is a complete translation, not authentic language.I bought this book, ""winner of a 2005 Parents' choice award"" and am completely suprised that it won !I regret my purchase, which will be donated to Goodwill at my next trip there."
3,Just Ok,"I am a little disappointed with this product. Although the book is great for non-French speaking parents (it has French on one side and English on the other, along with illustrations) the cd is not very entertaining for a baby or toddler. Not to mention, at many points, the voice on the cd does not even sound like a native French speaker (I speak French and have lived in France). There is really only one person speaking the entire time (it sounds like the same person does the adult and child voice), and the whole cd is the ""adult"" saying or asking something and the ""child"" responding. There is no music or anything that would make my baby want to listen to it."
1,Annoying cd!,"Although this book has some good qualities--English translations of everyday French conversations--I found the recording to be extremely annoying! It would have been fine if they had not chosen to use adult voices (and especially, men!) to stand in for kids. What's the deal with that? I thought it was a joke when I heard it in the first track, but then it continued throughout the whole cd. Terrible! I also expected the cd to have all the songs on it, so I could play the music in my car for ky children, only to find out I have to download the songs as mp3s and copy them onto another disc. What aggravation.I am disappointed with this purchase and will not recommend it to others. Poor taste, and poor quality"
4,Like it!,"I disagree with the complaints that the reader sounds monotone. I think it's a nice change from the constant chirpiness of most children's recordings. I think she sounds like a real mom. The little voice, whether child or adult, cracks me up. Like another reviewer, I don't want to learn how to reserve a hotel room or order in a restaurant, but listen to the dialogue and pronunciation in everyday use."
3,"""Yawn""","While "" Play and Learn French"" has a native French speaker narrating songs and talking through differing activities that are illustrated in the book, I find it a quite boring presentation. My daughter who is five years old will look at the pictures and finds the cartoon ""bandes desinée"" images amusing but is not taken with the cd language tracks. When learnign a language, especially at a young age, even as an adult, I recommend buying cd/ book collections that are easy listening so that the more times you listen, the quicker you learn it. This book/ cd option is not one that you'll want to listen to time and time again. We have many cds and sound tracks which are genuine and captivating. I recommend he following: Un Deux Trois: First French Rhymes (Book & CD) (French Edition) [Paperback]Opal Dunn (Compiler), Patrice Aggs (Illustrator) as well as Comptines a Chanter 1 - Book + CD-Audio (French Edition) [Audio CD]Collectif (Author)(Book & CD)."
4,Enjoyable and Helpful,This book can be used by those who are familiar with some basic French vocabulary and grammar.The book and the CD together help those who want to speak French right away. It is a fun way of learning to speak French.
4,"Good item for the price, but if I could be a little more picky...","Praise: I love all the different daily activities and dialogues included in the book. I have been learning vocabulary myself, even though I already speak French. It's really nice to have an audio version of the book on CD as well. On the CD, they have native speakers acting out the dialogues and singing the songs.Criticism: The narrator on the CD could use a little more enthusiasm in her acting--her voice is pretty monotone. Also, the little girl's voice doesn't sound like a real little girl, but an adult making a kid's voice! I thought the producers of the book could have been more authentic. The songs don't really have any accompaniment as far as musical instruments go, so they're not that fun to listen to, but I plan on learning the songs so I can sing them to my kids in a more animated way."
4,Formidable,Charming and age appropriate. Engaging for the parent and digestible for the child. I am so happy someone did this. Its unique
5,Use only sporadically but it works!,"I am an off and on ""I want to learn French"" person. I know a few phrases only and enjoy picking up new ones every now and then. This book is fantastic for that. It gives me the visual context I need (phrases written in both French and English) to go with the pronunciation on the recording. I find it quite easy to pick up new phrases any time I attempt to. So I would have to rate this a great beginning French primer."
1,Garbage smells better than this product!!!,"I purchased this product to add to a spritz for my hair.This was absolutely, the worst smelling scent i've ever smelled. It was rancid. I knew it had to be a joke for it to receive such positive feedback. I'm now convinced that the positive reviews were from employees of the Co. forced to do so. No Joke!!!I notified the seller as to my feelings of how incredibly awful this scent was. I was informed there was nothing they could do. Told me to notify the manufacturer, which made no sense, since I ordered this putrid scent from the seller. They never informed me as to how I could contact the manufacturer. I filed a claim with Amazon, and they found in my favor, and refunded my money.Two more words to sum up my review: STAY AWAY!!!!!!!"
5,Yes more please,This is a very very good scent of Jasmine Essential Oil.I purchased this actually at my local grocery store and I have used it to add to my bath line products.Since this particular scent is sensualizing I like to add 1 to 2 drops to my products that I create for evening time. Right before you crawl into bed scent.This is a very good Essential Oil.
5,Erotic!,"This is probably the most erotic gay 'novel' ever written!!!! The details are fabulous!!!I now own 2 copies, so when the 1st wears out, I will still have one to read and reread!!"
3,Noisy introduction to a talented young folkie,"The debut from modern folk-prodigy Oberst was a noisy, rambling, sometimes melodic wreck of an acoustic-based, whine-intensive album which often disguises a songwriting edge with harsh production accentuating grating vocals. Still, at a mere 18 years old it was no wonder that borrowed charisma and instrumental knowledge combined to turn many heads in the industry. Behind the jangly and blatant pleas for attention this Dylan upstart had forged for himself at that point (fractured, goaty vocals and dissonant, musically frustrated climaxes) lies an undeniable songwriting intelligence that shines brightest in tiny transitions while Oberst is not so determined to convince his listener he is in pain."
1,A Horrible Game!!!!!,"When I bought this game, I thought it was going to be good. But after playing it, I was wrong. The graphics are a joke. Especially for being on PS3. The graphics were better last year-2k6, on Play Station 2. The crowd looks like they are in a nintendo 64 game. Also, during gameplay, the players move like zombies. This game is a complete waste of money. I wouldn't take it for free. NBA 07 is a much,much better game."
3,Im not the basketball type.,"This game is good. I didn't like it much cause i dont like playing basketball in consoles. I consider it boring. The game itself gives the user what it offers. Nice graphics, nice gameplay and a very well whought game. I recommend it (or 2008) to any basketball lover."
1,ps3???,"Graphics and gameplay are very disappointing for a ps3 game. I've never been a 2k7 bball fan, but thought ps3 might make it better, and this was cheap. After trying it twice, we never played it again."
3,"Thought-provoking, but flawed","Capon's Parables of the Kingdom is bound to bring about fruitful re-examination of the parables captured in Matthew 13. However, Capon seems to confuse the intent of the Gospel writer in placing these parables together with the intent of Jesus, who, in all likelihood, did not order them in this way. Moreover, Capon, who is a Greek scholar, often focuses on the importance and possible interpretations of Greek words used in the Gospel; as Jesus may not have used these particular Greek words (Matthew was probably written some 40 years after Jesus' death)or may even have told them in Aramaic, this emphasis can be misleading."
4,Pre MMORPG Fun,"The PS2 version of this game had the best interface (pc version is a bit clumsy), but overall the game play is fun and progressive. At times it can become a bit tedious but the overall story does keep it moving along.Overall, a game geared towards RPG and content players."
2,Misleading size dimensions,"I was expecting a 32 inch width. The label on the carrying bag specifies 32 inches. The actual width is 29 inches! The ends were easy to set up but the two middle leg supports were impossible to connect until I bent them slightly inwards, then they were easy to connect to the main frame. I would've given 4 stars if the width had been stated accurately."
4,Strong first release,"This is the first Mixologists album released to the general public. However, the Mixologists have a somewhat old and extremely successful history by winning (or being on the top 3) of multiple DJ battles and championships in Europe since they originally formed in 1997.Before they released Champion Sounds in late 2003. DJ Go and Benny G (Mixologists) released a CD ""Flip the Script"" on Knowledge magazine's March 2003 issue. That CD is a must-get five-star CD. Similar to this one but with more melodic tracks combining excellent hip-hop with classic drum and bass. In addition, Flip the Script, introduces the jungle drummer and MC trip.Don't get me wrong. This CD is worth buying to understand what the Mixologists are all about but if you like this, you need to get a copy of Flip the Script and you will be extremely satisfied. You maybe able to find it in the web or by subscribing to Knowledge magazine and ordering past issues."
2,Restrictive Limitations,"I have evaluated this product as an alternative to using the free Microsoft FolderShare service for syncronizing files & folders between my computers. I have found that there are some very restrictive limitations when configuring a file sharing workspace. More specifically, a file sharing workspace is limited to 2GB or 5,000 files, whichever comes first. Once the limit is reached, the files in the workspace will no longer be synchronized.In these days of 4GB+ flash drives, having a 2GB file sharing limit is terribly restrictive. I have stopped using MS Groove as a result and am currently looking for a better alternative to FolderShare."
2,Microsoft Groove 2007?,"Though I received this product for free...I have not really tried it out, for at least 30 days... I would say it has its issues, some down time, but it does allow users to upload files to a little server... so that users or groups can collaborate with each other, and if a user is not online and editing a file, it will automatically be up to date once that user logs in... which I consider truly amazing!-John C."
3,It seemed to fly okay.,"This book seems to be aimed at two distinct age groups. Children towards the top of the stated target range of 4-8 years might find the (small print) text interesting, while younger children would be more likely to enjoy lifting the flaps to see what's underneath.I bought this to give my son a chance to get accustomed to the idea of flying. At 16 months, he enjoyed looking at the illustrations and lifting the flaps, but he had little patience for the text. Perhaps the book did make the trip a bit easier, but the trip also made the book more popular. After we returned, My First Plane Ride became one of his favorites.There's a minor typo, though. The text talks about the plane arriving at ""it's"" gate. So far my son hasn't noticed. :)"
5,Family fun,Great movie that we need to bring back. Wholesome fun without all the cussing and nudity.
4,A really nice Don Knotts comedy from 1971,"This film seems to capture some of the magic DK created on the Andy Griffith show, although I agree with some of the reviews here that the plot slackens somewhat compared to his 60s comedies. Still, it pulls together elements of these and the AGS, so it's definitely worthwhile for the DK fan. I guess it just didn't fit into the 'Reluctant Hero' pack that is available, but in terms of content, it is that sort of film."
1,Not funny at all,"I'm as much of a Don Knotts fan as anyone on the planet. But my high expectations were brought low as my family and I suffered through this stink bomb. It is simply dreadful. There is not a funny moment in this movie. Compared to this movie, ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" gets ten stars."
2,"Love Don Knotts, not this movie.","The story line was predictable and not very funny. Don Knott's role was well played, but the friend (Frank Welker) was incredibly lame. I also thought the ending was pretty weak. I love Don Knotts, but didn't love this movie."
3,The Ending?,"First off let me begin by saying I really like Don Knotts, I also like Elaine Joice (growing up when she was on Match Game I made it a point to watch it) and Yvonne Craig was very good Loved her in Batman and Kissing Cousins. I recognize and have enjoyed lots of movies with the character actors in this movie. (they a few of them that showed up in various movies at that period of time. And How To Frame a Figg was pretty good in parts. However the ending had to ending it had something to be desired. When I got to it I thought wow another plot twist, but noooo. Without telling about it and revealing it to first time watchers I'll just suffice it to say when you get to that plot twist it just suddenly ends. Credits roll music that's it. Did they run out of money or film? I'm not saying don't watch it because it does have it's momets that are funny but don't expect a good ending."
2,Nearing the end of the line,"This work of Don Knotts' doesn't hold a candle to ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken"" or ""The Reluctant Astronaut"". One of the most disappointing aspects is that Knotts is not the bumbler he was in the other movies, but place second fiddle in that aspect to a young unknown (to this day) actor playing a city garbage collector.As for the transfer of this movie, however, all I can say is...it's too bad some of the movie companies don't put this kind of care into some of the classics....it's beautiful.While I can't really recommend the film on its own merits, I will say that if you are a fan of the movie, you will be thrilled with the job MGM has done with putting it on DVD.Film and trailer are both anamorphic."
1,Not even as good as the original,This battery is not even as good as the original. It is 850 mAh where as the original is 1000 mAh. The product description conveniently left that part out? somethings a little fishy about that.
4,sampler,"Megan McCauley has a strong individual sound in her voice. Her music is a different but beautiful combination, kinda like Michelle Branch meets Avril Lavigne. Her sampler only has a few songs on it but most of her music you've probably already heard because she's already been on several soundtracks ex. fantastic four and Elektra. If you want a few more good songs to listen to I suggest getting this album sampler."
3,Good Book,"A nice review of light Aircraft from the early years of experimentation to todays production. . .A little dated it would be more useful with some updated material, and more technical information and recommendations. . ."
4,Delightful Hanukkah story,Read this book to my grand kids this year at our family Hanukkah party. They loved it. I loved it too. It was a nice precurser to playing the dreidle game.
2,Looking from a perspective of useabillity,"Hi all!This book isn't neceserily a ""Linux Programing"" book because other than commands to mount the diskette or CD-ROM or DOS partition it really doesn't have anything with Linux but with curses and UNIXoids in general. It creates an editor using curses library under consoleCreating yet another editor under Linux is not what Linux society now needs. It would be better that the writer has concentrated on advanced concepts of GNU make, automake, autoconf, gdb, i18n libraries calls, and the linux system programming overall, or at least to describe curses functions as a reference so that the book can be usefull even after one has read it.The book is perfect for a UNIX/C beggining programer, but considering usability, it has come out 5-7 years to late for any Linux user.And last, I would reccomend ""Programming with GNU Software"" from O'Reilly instead."
4,Featured Alternate of the Writer's Digest Book Club,"A unique compendium of 9,000 descriptive phrases. Helps to overcome ""writer's block."" Provides fresh ideas""...deserves a place on the desk of every author, creative writing teacher, and editor. Easy to read type. A bargain."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"The phrases are helpful to hilarious. This book is also a must-have for all aspiring authors, it's handy for putting things into words that you can't quite put your finger on."
3,decent product.,"Truby has valid ideas. Though you have to take his ideas with the knowlege that Truby himself was never able to successfully apply them. His sole pro credit is as a tv writer on a series made over a decade ago. But that doesn't stop Truby from pontificating on all the ""mistakes"" made by writers far more successful than himself."
1,"Terrible software, no Customer service","Attended the seminar, got the book, purchased the software, the other negative reviews were right. Terrible software, cannot even open it up because it requires 2 activation numbers. Customer service took 3 days to respond with activation #. And now it has a new activation# and won't take the new one given to me.. Had to order a backup... Would not recommend this software, just read the book and attend the seminar.Also They(customer service) are very difficult to reach....it seems to be all email, and late email responses...have yet to talk to anybody at Truby.com!!!!!!!! after calling for 4 days!!!"
5,It works!,I followed the process in John Truby's Blockbuster software to write two romance novels. Found a publisher for both. Am now on the third book and have ordered the upgrade for Blockbuster.
4,Good look at the early republic,"Oftentimes, we lament the existence of political parties and see them as the source of all evil in the country. Freeman's book takes a look at 1790s America, when parties did not yet truly exist, and finds that it was not much better.Some of the material here I have read in different form elsewhere, but there is also a lot of new stuff too. In particular, the different methods of attacking political opponents were new to me.Just as we often bemoan the existence of parties, we also sometimes complain about the lack of shame in today's society (as shown through reality TV, etc.). This book also shows the flip side of this, to an era when honor and self-respect are deemed so important that even slight insults can lead to canings and duels.Freeman does a good job at showing a political world that is quite different than our own. If not perfect, this book is still good enough to recommend to anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
4,a beautiful book but......,"An absolutly gorgerous book. I think I am a little greedy in that I was expecting more from this book. I believe there are around 60 recipes. Some are divine, some were the standards found in many books and some I don't think were worth putting in(like chocolate dipped dried fruit). There are numerous lush pictures and poetic discriptions of candies made at La Maison Du Chocolat but no actual recipes or guidelines for candy making. Although I may sound critical, the book is truly beautiful and one can sense the author's passion for his art."
2,"Pretty Pictures, thats about it.",this is easily one of the poorest written pastry cook books ever. Don't expect any of the recipes to truly work. Referenced the book for a chocolate souffle after owning it for a few years. I could tell just by looking at the ingredients that the recipe wouldn't work.
1,Overpriced noise,"Paid $35 for the CDs, because I was desperate and sleep deprived - my son has sleeping issues. What a bunch of BS. It did nothing for him, after all the promises and guarantees on their website. Contacted customer service for a refund. No one ever replied to me - $35 down the drain. This is how companies make money by taking advantage of desperate people who are looking for relief."
3,Disappointed,"I wasn't able to play this CD. Unlike most CDs, it is not a stamped copy, it is a burned copy which makes it unplayable in my older CD player. For $20 I expected it to work like any other CD.I was able to listen to it in my computer and I really like the CD. Too bad I can't drag the computer into baby's room because I've heard so many good things about the sleeping magic of this CD."
1,Slow growing seed... Poor quality,"I am new at growing wheatgass about a year into it. I have purchased seed from many different vendors but I have to say this seed ""Todd Seed"" have been the worse to grow, it normally takes 5 to 7 days with other seed from sprouting to 7 or 8 inches for harvest. I'm growing under the same conditions and this stuff is taking forever and does not look healthy, I gave it a try 2 other times with the same result...SO I will go back to the other vendors who did me right. Sorry Todd your seed is poo."
1,Seeds Plus Bugs,There were bugs in this product. I've grown wheatgrass from seeds for over 15 years. You can tell when you first fill the soaking jar w/water (to rinse them). Gently shake it back and forth and the bugs float to the top. If you bring a bug into your pantry it will lay eggs and you'll have bugs in all of you grains. I had to throw it away.
4,Greatest (and only?) Korn Shell Quick Reference,"I now code in ksh on a daily basis. This handy little reference follows the organization of Olczak's excellent book ""The Korn Shell User and Programming Manual"" which I learned from. I only occasionally have to refer back to documentation and his Quick Reference Guide is just the ticket. My copy has a lot of yellow highlighter and margin notes. The previous reviewer's complaint about lack of an index is valid but since the Guide is only 44 pages it's not much of concern. Once you become a regular ksh coder you'll find the Guide indispensable. I have."
2,Let Down in the End,"Well, the book was very helpful up until the last chapter (and most difficult) on financials. The author gives you just the bare bones and then you are either on your own, or you are directed to her website where you can download more detailed help for a ""low cost"". Very frustrating. Would not recommend."
4,if youre in a hurry!,It's a great book if you need to get all your facts and figures together in a hurry. It doesn't replace her big book of writing a business plan but this does the job in a pinch.
4,Not really a romance,"I enjoyed this book but I don't think it should be catagorized as a romance novel. Graham was likeable but a pig. Submit got on my nerves after awhile. I could see why she had reservations about Graham, but still she was a prude in my opinion. It wasn't your usual mind candy romance but it was very enjoyable. It leaves me wanting to read more of Judith Ivory's novels."
1,Unbelievably Boring and Bland,"The book had potential, but Ivory writes with such a strange, convoluted style, using uncommon words here and there, that the book just infuriates you. The plot would have been better had Ivory's writing been more commanding of a true romance taking place. I think the book was a huge waste of my time and money. This was the first book I read of Ivory's, and needless to say, probably the last."
2,"Great writing skill, Unappealing Hero","I am a big fan of Ivory, and her superb writing shines in this book. However, the hero ruined it for me. He was childish, degenerate, and had few, if any, redeeming qualities. Another thing turned me off: the hero had an on-going sexual affair with a woman other than the heroine throughout the book. The hero was just icky to me. The heroine lacked emotion (which I think was the point Ivory was trying to make), and all of this combined ruined the romance aspect of this book for me. Not a very solid *romance* in my opinion, but a great *story,* if that makes sense."
3,Left me wanting more,"This was the second Ivory book I read and was really expecting something more. I got lost in the details in this one and how the plot just drug and drug and drug along. I really wanted to like and feel for the characters, but nothing ever came along to make that happen."
1,BORING,I never connected with the characters in this book. I have read countless romance stories; this was no romance. This was the first and last book I read from Ms. Ivory. Please do not buy this book!
3,Not as good as her other books,"I will preface by saying that I normally really like Judith Ivory's books. This one is the exception. I cannot pinpoint why. It wasn't as steamy as her other books for one but there was something more lacking and I am not sure what it is. I was just disappointed. Don't let that stop you from picking her other books up because I really liked them. So, if you are just starting out on Ivory, I would recommend one of her other books like Sleeping Beauty. Her writing under Cuevas is good too."
1,DON'T BOTHER!,Quite possibly the worst book I have ever read. And that is saying a lot because I have read thousands of books! I don't know how they called this book a romance. The two main characters hardly ever interacted with each other until the last 1/4 of the book. The hero was in another relationship with another woman during almost the entire book. I definitey could never get into this terrible story. PLEASE PASS THIS BOOK UP!
1,Not what I expected,"This book dragged on and on (hard to finish it). There was no great mystery behind it. I did not like the hero a bit, he was such a libertine! And the widow, well, not much to say about her either."
2,Very strange for a romance,"The writing was good but I just didn't like this book - the characters or the story. It wasn't much of a romance, in my opinion. And I sure didn't like the ending. I think I'll pass on Ivory from now on."
5,"It was great when Judy Cuevas wrote it, too!","What a bummer, to wait for the next Judith Ivory book, order it, and find out it's the same book she wrote under her other name of Judy Cuevas. Why doesn't ... the Review indicate that? ...All her other books (under Judith Ivory) are wonderful, she's a great writer. Black Silk is not your ordinary Romance Novel but it's written well and it's unusual plot and characters make it a book to remember. Too bad I didn't remember it was issued before!"
1,The Back cover is misleading,"I purchased this book on the strength of the back cover. It did not live up to my expectations.I don't know exactly what I disliked about the book, but it did not engage me with any of the characters. I lost interest by page 68. I flicked through thinking that I was not giving the book ample opportunity, alas it was not the case.There was nothing wrong with the writing, but at times I felt that I was not reading a romance but a history book, with very unlikeable characters. The book was beyond slow.I am sorry but on the strength of this book, I don't think will be purchasing another of Ms Ivory's books.Just because a romance is set in histrical times, does not mean it should not be exciting!"
3,Love Country Style,This is chick lit but I thought the author could up the page turning factor by dispensing vital information about the characters' personalities in bits and pieces interspeced thru' out the entire plot instead of dishing it out in one go. It spoils the suspense of the plot.The rural description of the English farming life mirrors the current reality quite accurately.
3,Pretty darn good,"Really enjoyed this book, It was the first of hers that I read, and it was at a time when I was just not in the mood for anything too serious. Although the ending was predictable, the characters were fun and it was a good read."
3,Cute and Well Made,"I like the mitten, but the characters are a little hard to distinguish. They are well made, but the children have a hard time telling what is a mole and what is a fox - the characters are not easily identified. However, it does help children in the retelling of the story, which is why I purchased it."
4,excellent if life was a little longer.,"We just finished a custom trim job for one of our customers. This job has a 10,000.00 trim up-grade package. We custom made much of the trim and used several of these cutters. They worked wonderful in the hardwoods but did dull under the heavy usage faster than we would have liked. I like the Delta tools."
1,The Jinx,Boooorrrriiiinnnnnggggg. This book was so far fetched from reality like any of these things could happen and would happen. Everything that came along was so predicatble. Also the author really needs to leave her subliminal politcal messages out of the book and concentrate on her writing-so she can write better books.One star was too generous.
5,Great Resource for Marketers,I bought this awhile back and found it to be interesting. I used it as the base for a college paper. Advertising today holds nothing to the raciness of the 50's and 60's. Back then they were subtle and clever. Today we are too blatant.Great book and definitly worth the buy. But kindle readers may find it not as intriguing without the clear bold pictures
4,good basic holster,"good holster for the money retains firearm well, wish it had a larger area for a wider belt like 1,5 vs 1,25"
1,Bizarre Designs are of Limited Usefulness,"It's hard to imagine how the designs in this book would be useful. They are not very good drawings as such things go and they are not particularly representative of the Art Nouveau period.A Dover reprint of old public domain material that perhaps should not have been revived. Save your money, there are better sources out there for animal jewelry designs."
1,Not so classy,This item seems cheaply made and not well put together. One of the votives broke immediately and the twigs dont stay attached to the frame the way they should. THE COLOR IS BLACK...not brown. That was very misleading. I spent too much on shipping and product for this and I actually bought two..
4,pleasantly surprised,"I used this flour to make the banana bread recipe that is on the back of the package. After reading some of the reviews, I was quite worried about how it would taste. I was able to serve the banana bread to some friends that were visiting and we all enjoyed it. I have not used the flour for anything else, however, I did not notice the bean flavor that has been mentioned in other reviews."
5,To Be Fair..!,"Okay, clearly some people are sensitive to the bean taste, but not everyone is. This flour is well worth a try! After trying rice flour mixes, cornstarch and potato starch mixes - please! - I didn't happen to like the slimy texture of those. Bob's Red Mill AP GF Flour is all I use, and I'm completely happy with the results. All my bread is from Bob's sandwich bread recipe, I am addicted to Bob's chocolate chip cookies, and my ""normal"" husband and I have crumpets made with the AP GF flour every afternoon. I wouldn't live gluten-free without it."
1,Terrible garbanzo bean aftertaste!!!!,This mix tastes terrible. It was a waste of money. So sad because it's so hard to get good gluten-free bread and costs so much more than average bread. I was so disappointed.
2,"Things look awesome, but the taste.....","I was given about 5 bags of this flour (I have celiac disease) by a loved one. I've tried making everything from cookies to waffles to bread and cakes. Everything looks amazing, but has a strange, sweet, extremely unpleasant aftertaste. I'm going to throw out the rest of it."
2,Would rather use beans than this flour.,This flour has a terrible taste. I'd rather puree beans and use them. It would taste better. I prefer honeyville's almond flour over this anyday.
2,Very strong off taste,"Recently started a gluten free diet. Have to say, I was hoping for a lot more from something that claimed ""all-purpose"" . First use was in pancakes. Now, I like garbanzo beans, but the garbanzo/fava bean flour in here was overpowering in it's taste. Sorghum or rice flour w white/bean flour is much closer to what I'd consider as ""all-purpose"" to get a good protein content."
1,Terrible flavor!!!,"I used this product, and my family hated it! we have found that Oat flour is the best solution, the flavor of this product was so overpowering that you could not taste the other ingrediants, flour is suppose to be used as a base, to take on the flavors of the other ingrediants in the recipe, this product has a opposite effect , it has a horrid aftertaste. In todays economy we cant afford to throw away food because a product has a poor flavor. Dont waste your money on this!"
1,Awful!,"While I will agree that it's pretty handy to be able to sub this cup for cup, the taste is so awful and the texture so gummy that it outweighs the convenience BY FAR! Made banana muffins (with a recipe from the company) and the aftertaste is so bad I can't stomach them, even with lots of banana and sugars. Truly disgusting. If the taste were good I could overlook the gumminess bit add them together and it's beyond unpleasant. Yuck. So glad I only bought a small pack to try first!"
3,Strange flavor but great texture in baking,"There's a reason why all of the recipes on the back of these packages involve sweet baked goods like muffins or banana bread - you need to add something sweet to the flour to cover up the flavor. I think it's the large quantity of bean flour in it, which makes it taste very strange, not exactly pleasant. I made a normal (non-sweet) bread with it that had a wonderful texture but tasted unpalatable unless I made it sweet - the bread made EXCELLENT french toast, covered with sugar, cinnamon and honey. So this flour definitely has its uses, but as a bread substitute it's poor at best."
4,great product,I am new to cooking without wheat. This flour makes it alot easier. I live 50-100 miles from good shopping so thie is a good way to get what I need
5,Good for gluten-free pizza,"Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free All-Purpose Flour, 44-Ounce Units (Pack of 4)This flour finally restored the basic right to eat pizza in my gluten-free household. Whisk together one cup of warm water (90-100 degrees F), 1 teaspoon of yeast, 1 1/2 cups of this flour and a dollop of olive oil. Turn your oven on for a few minutes, pour the batter into an oiled skillet and let it rise in the warmed oven for an hour. Bake just the crust at 375 for 10 minutes. Then spread the cheese or other toppings on the crust and return to the oven until the cheese is bubbly and browning. Serve the pizza and pass the tomato sauce! (Don't bake the pizza with tomato sauce - the crust can't keep liquid from penetrating - that's gluten's job."
1,Bizarre Aftertaste,"Tried the gluten-free mix in apple muffins sweetened with applesauce and agave nectar. Awful. Had to throw them out, but I figured it might have been the baking powder that lent this strange, bitter/sour aftertaste. Then I tried it to make a roux for a chicken-broth-based cream sauce - and I had to throw that out too. The aftertaste is highly unpleasant and I don't see how anyone gets past it. I'm very happy with Bob's Gluten-Free Pancake Mix, so this was a surprise."
5,The best thing in the world for my son!,"My son is allergic to wheat, corn, oats and rice. It is soooo hard to find anything that is Gluten Free and does not contain rice. So I was ecstatic to find this and immediately went home and made peanut butter cookies. They turned out great. I admit they have a bit of an aftertaste but it did not deter me from eating four cookies. My son loved them, and he is very picky. Even my daughter loved them and she can have regular grains. The recipes on the [...] website were very helpful too."
1,Better off making your own mix,"I used this mix a few times to make a cake and muffins. It is super gross! Ruined the flavor of both. You're better off making your own blend of sorghum flour, tapioca flour and potato or corn starch. Stick with Bob's Red Mill GF bread mixes, but skip this one."
2,Do you like Beans?,"Bob's flour is one of the first mixed GF flours that I tried. The only problem is that everything I put it into, ended up tasting like beans or lentils. I tried to thicken soups, tasted like beans...tried to make cake, tasted like beans. I seriously thought I had some sort of taste bud problem. I always cut the bag open and poured it into a container, so I couldn't check the ingredient label. In desperation, I went to the supermarket and looked at the bag. Sure enough, Bob mixes ""GARBANZO BEAN FLOUR"" into this mix. So caution, if you like bean-tasting food, then this is the best flour for you!! Instead, I'd highly recommend Gluten-Free Pantry's Beth's Flour mix. It's amazing in both texture and taste, and works as a substitute for any recipe that calls for flour."
1,Bob's Red Mill GF Flour,"I tried this three years ago in a birthday cake and it tasted so foul, only one person in the house could stand to eat it and that was after it was then smothered in Nutella. So today I gave it another try, not sure why, and I am going to have to throw these cookies out. I am not someone with a sensitive palette at all. I've used Better Batter with lots of success and for brownie recipes, have used buckwheat or cornflour with a lot of success. Their other products are just fine: this bean flour issue is no joke."
3,ok for how old it is,i did like it but the older model did freeze the system sometimes so be careful because it will freeze the system
4,Fun Hockey Game,"From someone who is not a hockey fan and hasn't played a hockey video game since Blades of Steel on NES (Damn, I know) this game is fun. Like I said I'm not a hockey fan so I wasn't sure if this game would be too advanced for someone who just wants to pick up the controls and try their hand at it. To my surprise this game is easy to play even for someone who's only knowledge of hockey is ""get the puck in the net"". Hell I didn't even know they changed sides after each period like tennis or football. I'm not sure how much I'll play this game but since it's cheap now it was worth picking up. The graphics are nice and the gameplay is fun and simple enough for a hockey-know-nothing like me."
4,Dream Sight of gator land,"I just love to watch these DVD`s,specially in winter time with nice relaxing background music, then I feel relaxed even when I am at my spinning workouts, nice and natural view of a beautiful landscape. It`s just a dream to watch.."
2,WEAK!,"When I ordered the EDITED VERSION of HARLEM WORLD, I was excited to hear it. It was a good and appealing for the first week, and that was it.I don't listen to that cd much anymore because MASE couldn't rap well, the beats are so so, and the guest stars aren't that good. Also, if you compare the dirty version and the clean, there is a track missing off of the clean."
1,Mase let me down,"I got this album as a gift, and I was excited because I had already heard ""feelin so good"" and ""lookin at me"" When I put it on, I couldn't stand any song on there for more than a minute. I only like three songs on there, the two above and ""what you want"", and then that's only because Total drowns him out. I also noticed how conceited he is, like most rappers are. Then he throws in pointless interludes. And finishes his album with a PITIFUL attempt, trying to sing a slow song. There are lots of guests: Busta, Dmx, Puffy (of course), Lil' Kim, ect. Someone needs to tell Mase that collaborating with lots of artists DOES NOT guarantee success."
3,MASE THE HARLEM BAD BOY,"MASON has a great voice for rapping but his lyrics are really not to to different through out the album. Puffy hooks the beats but the album does not strike big. this does not belong on the rap charts, maybe the dance charts."
5,the best music,"First of all I would just like to say that Mase's music is the ""BOMB."" I almost listen to it everyday. Anyone who doesn't have has to get it. But he really needs to get his s##t going in his music videos they are all the same. The only good ones are the ones with Puffy in them. Don't get me wrong I LOVE his music he just needs a little help."
2,""" Harlem World "" brings birth to a "" Harlem Girl ""","Mase's album was complete trash. Let me rephrase that. His album was sewage. He only had two songs that I liked, while the other songs were far from making the grade. The last thing we need is another L.L.. Maybe we need Canibus to break his butt down on a record."
4,BLAZE THE CHARTS,"MA$E IS VERY CUTE i JUST LOVE HIS LIPS. iM MAD MA$E RETIRED I HOPE IT WAS FOR A GOOD COST AND HOPE MY HONEY WILL BE BACK SOON, HIS CD WAS VERY BLAZED AND HOPE HE WILL MAKE MORE JUST LIKE IT. P.S ALL YOU PEOPLE SAYING IT IS CORNEY YALL CORNEY."
2,A feather in his cap,"I have read every one of S. Woods' books, but this one was my first big disappointment. It is obvious Mr. Woods wishes to promote his political agenda, which he has every right to do. But it so overshadowed everything else, that the story line was lost. If making all conservatives look like dishonest morons was his goal, he certainly succeeded in this book.The story was predictable and certainly not his best, but my enjoyment was also very tainted by his unabashed promotion of the liberal viewpoint as the only intelligent, honest way to go.Mr. Woods, many of your fans are conservative. Please don't slap us in the face with such one-sided, offensive, and actually untrue writing."
1,Thriller? Think again,"My local library had this book on display because it is a political thriller during this political season. Don't let the description fool you. It is not a thriller. The story line is good, but I think Woods went to print prematurely. Some of the actions of the mafia nut will, frankly, make you laugh and say ""yeah right!"" This book was written pre-9/11, but even back then the secret service would not look the other way when bomb sniffing dogs hone in on a ""chocolate cake."" They are not going to miss massive explosives under a podium at the DNC and they certainly are not going to miss a sniper rifle hiding behind a heat vent.The suspense doesn't exist in the book and even if it did there are too many unbelievables to make the book intriguing."
1,Not a novel,"Stuart Woods has written some excellent books - Chiefs, Palindrome and many others - but this is not one of them. The title is ""The Run : a Novel"" but, in fact, this is not a novel; it is a political diatribe. If you think Cuba has a great form of government and love Fidel, Ted Kennedy and similar communists, you may enjoy this book. If, on the other hand, you think Thomas Jefferson got it right, Rush Limbaugh is a moderate and the Second Amendment means what it says then you should pass on this one."
3,Interesting but not realistic,"This book tells the story of a senator from Georgis (a moderate Democrat) and his run for president. Of course ""the run"" for president is full of suspense and plenty of close calls. The story held my attention, but some parts of the book were highly unrealistic (including the political scenarios). This would be a good read for person who is interested in politics, who wants to read something light."
2,Stuart is a Liberal and this book proves it,"I have read most of Stuart Woods books and usually enjoy them mainly because I am looking for escape and don't have to think very much. This book selects the liberal's worst boogy man, the mountain man, hard right gun freak, who doesn't exist, as the villain. He also does a less than believable portrayal of the political figures. All in all a poor effort."
1,Wrong cds in box,I received this audiobook but it was not the one that should have been in the box. It wasnt the Run at all.
2,Politics Over Shadows the Story,"The purpose of popular fiction is to entertain, to ask the reader to step into the story world and suspend belief.Stuart Woods takes the weakest character from his best seller, CHIEFS (Will Lee) and gives his a run for the White House on a Liberal ticket in THE RUN. The political agenda kills a weak story that has been done over and over into nauseous pap.Nash Black, author of SINS OF THE FATHERS."
1,Run away from this book,"The Run is one of the dumbest books I have ever read! The storyline had potential, but the end result of every attempt at a plot twist was ridiculous. ""Run"" away from this book!"
2,the run is more of a trot,"as with other stuart woods books the plot moves along nicely, but a little predictable. the problem for me was the heavy handed political tone.if you like those good hearted democrates and hate those nasty house of representives republicans who voted to impeach bill clinton then the political tone will not bother you. if your politics prefers style over substance then you will like it. for example, canidate will lee insists on appointing an ethics advisor. he finds a perfect retired judge and introduces him with great fanfare, but then never consults him. oh well his intentions were good.over all a light trot...not a hard run."
2,Thriller? NOT!,"While the book moves along at a good pace and is a very easy read....it is NOT a thriller, nor did I find much in the way of suspense. (Read Konrad's review - it hits the nail right on the head]. I'm a big fan of Mr. Woods. His previous books (Dirt, Swimming to Catalina, Choke, Dead in the Water, Worst Fears Realized] were great fun, lots of twists and turns. All were Five Stars! This book however is NOT thrilling --- anyone that said so either wants to sell you the book or finds mowing the lawn thrilling! If you are a ""Woods"" fan and must read it....save your $$ and buy it in paperback."
1,Should have written a white paper,"This is my first and last Stuart Woods book. I wanted to try a new author so, unfortunately, I went out and purchased this book. It was so unbalanced where the political characters are concerned (all the good guys are Democrats and all the bad guys are Republicans or conservatives) that I almost gave up in the first quarter of the book. However, I am a disciplined reader so I finished the book. I suggest that the next time Mr. Woods wants to write a book with a one-sided political viewpoint he just write a white paper for all good liberals to read and spare the rest of us from his preaching. I will gag every time I see a Stuart Woods book on the bookshelf from now on."
4,Not bad at all!,"I had never heard of Stuart Woods and picked up ""The Run"" on a whim. I was very pleasantly surprised. The action was nicely paced, the story grabbed and held my interest throughout, and the ending was believable and satisfying. Nothing about the characters rang untrue -- perhaps a little stereotypical, but never unbelievable. I know very little nor am interested in politics, but enjoyed this book very much nevertheless. I look forward to reading more of Woods' books in the future."
4,An engrossing realistic story about a presidential race,"The Run is one of Stuart Woods' best books yet! For anyone who is interested in the inside workings of a U.S. Presidential race, this is the novel for you......especially if you are a Democrat. Woods has a great talent for crafting interesting characters while at the same time, creating a fascinating and believable story. There are all kinds of political dilemmas and alarming situations posed in this book; ones that could actually happen. While reading this book (in one sitting) I felt as if I was an inside staffer on the campaign, sitting by and observing. A satisfying read to be sure. If you read this and like it, read Chiefs and Grass Roots as well. They are equally as good."
1,Could have been so much better.,"I read Mr Wood's previous novels that featured Will Lee and they were good. I thought this would be too. Boy, was I wrong. It was so bland. This doesn't mean I won't read anything else by Mr Woods, because he doesn't always disappoint. It would be nice to have a sequel to Orchid Beach. I thought that was a wonderful read."
2,Disappointing,"This book was referred to me by a friend who thought that since I have worked in politics, I would enjoy the book. Here's what I will tell her -- it's about 85% accurate about how traveling presidential campaigns work, and that missing 15% created a problem for me. I kept saying,""That would never happen"" or ""He'd never do that."" And, the plot is too thin. The book is written mostly in dialogue, giving you little or no character development. Overall, it's a disappointing book that could have benefited from more research."
2,Not Up to Snuff,"Once again Stuart Woods has given us eminently readable book using characters from past novels. Unfortunately this one is nowhere near as good as some of his earlier works. The characters here seem very one-dimensional and a few of the plot twists are unbelievable if not downright ridiculous. An earlier reviewer mentioned this was the first book by Stuart Woods that he has read and he wasn't impressed. May I respectfully suggest reading ""Chiefs"", ""Run Before the Wind"", or ""L.A.Times"" to see Woods at his finest."
3,Predictable political plot by in large,"This book gets three stars because it's an easy vacation read and the pages turn pretty easily. I also learned some interesting trivia about the campaign world. But beyond that it's a pretty flat read, particularly for Stuart Woods. While Woods isn't likely to win a Pulitzer prize ever, his books are generally both high energy and original. This book is neither.The book is full of cliches. Will Lee reminds me much too much of Robert Redford in ""The Candidate."" The right wing stalker has been done over and over lately. The plotting is painfully predictible -- every crisis point has a happy ending. Even the dialogue is predictible. Do we really need to listen to the standard flight attendent speech in its entirety?Bottom-line: Not one of Woods' better efforts and there are better political thrillers out there. Still, if it's the only thing available at the airport, it'll entertain you for a few hours."
2,I demand a re-count!,"A recount of the money I spent on this book! The story was decent but contrived and forced a bit. I typically like Stuart Woods and have read just about all of his books, but this one was a disappointment and certainly the weakest of his I've read. It gave me the opinion that he was under some pressure to crank out another book and this was the best he could do. ""The Run"" is losely based on the 2000 Bush/Gore race. Add in an assassin (resurrected from ""Grass Roots"")and a Hollywood starlett with loose morals and a friend on death row (?) and you get a choppy story with little substance. Woods also used this book to inflict his personal Liberal politics on the reader. I personally disagree with those politics and don't want them creeping into my recreational reading. If you just must read it, it's worth a few nights. If you have other options, however, exercise them and vote against ""The Run."""
4,Grass Roots Remembered,"I vaguely remember Will Lee as being a man of moral virtue in Grass Roots (my favorite Stuart Woods book). He now returns as a man running for President. Unusual circumstances cause him to run before he is ready. Lee maintains his integrity throughout the campaign. There are many plot twists, assassination attempts, and a past love encounter to hold one's interest. Woods includes characters from some of his other books, but he does not feel the need to characterize them in depth. Surprises abound. They made this a good read."
1,Weak,"I picked this up hoping for a thriller but ended up slogging through it waiting for something to happen. I have not read any other Stuart Woods Books but I hope the others are better - I don't think I will risk it to find out. The characters are more caricatures with little development. The antagonist is a right-wing militia member (of course) who is out to kill a ""moderate"" Democrat candidate for President. The motive for this is never explored. The book is overly predictable and not very imaginative."
2,Where's the Action?,"The MarginCongressman Will Lee has decided to run for President of the U.S., the story develops around the campaign. Herein lies the good and the bad of this Stuart Woods novel. There is an enormous amount of information about campaigning that is very interesting since this (2008) is an election year. That part is interesting just from an educational point of view, however it crowds out the action normally seen in a Woods mystery. Throughout The Run there are a few assassination attempts and there is some action/excitment around these events. The ending is action filled, if you can wait that long.As far as my recommendation, it's an okay novel, but far from his best."
4,THE RUN - A quick-read political suspense thriller,"Hoping for another vacation with my alter ego (of-counsel stud investigator Stone Barrington), I got to vacation, instead, with a superb political suspense thriller, THE RUN. While the novel is light, breezy, and mostly predictable, Stuart Woods nonetheless holds you wondering about the actual fate of its main character, presidential nominee Senator Will Lee, to the very end. The stage is cleverly set for a myriad of possible twists and turns (could this thing go deeper than a never-elected President Ford?), but instead the shortest distance between two points prevails.For the Stuart Woods’ purists, cameo appearances by movie legend Vance Calder and former Stone Barrington flame, Arrington Calder, should suffice until Stone returns.Read it for what it is: a fun, quick-read thriller that is far more interesting to ponder than what we face in the voting booth this fall."
1,A vote NO,"I am a big Woods fan, but this one is a major disappointment. From political cliche to White House spin, this one feels like it was written by the DNC. There is a glaring absence of Wood's great style and use of character, and it felt like the book was thrown together to hit a deadline rather than tell a great story. I won't forget this one!"
3,3 1/2 star story,"The basic premise of this book tells the story of a man's run for the presidency. Its a straight forward novel (forgive the redundancy) with few surprises. This is not a top of the line thriller by any means, but the storyline is fast and to the point. With the thrills being few, the story is more about the goings on behind the scenes, and the angst and glory that goes along with politics. There are some manipulative, as well as criminal, characters spread throughout the novel that give it an overall fast pace.A quick read...recommend...Library"
3,My first Woods book,"This was my first Woods book, and I was not overly impressed.I picked up the book in an airport to read over a weekend - definately easy to read and kept me fairly interested, but unlike The State's (SC) recommendation on the back cover of the book, I don't think Stuart Woods could not ""teach Tom Clancy a thing or two"".Maybe I would have been better off reading the first Will Lee stories and moving on to this one, or maybe had I not lived through an actual close Presidential race this year would have made the book more exciting, either way it kept me occupied, just not coming back for more Woods."
1,Ridiculous Premise! Contradictory characterizations.,"Woods book THE RUN begins with a senator and his CIA employed wife sharing important matters in their personal and profeesional lives. hey seem well suited and honest with each other. Suddenly the author throws two facts at us, and each of them changes character and hides truths from their best friend. Ridiculous. Bad read."
3,"Entertaining, if shallow","If you are looking to kill a couple of hours the next time your flight is delayed, there are worse ways to do it than the latest novel from Stuart Woods. But then again, there are a lot of better ways to do it as well. First a warning, if you are a Republican, you are probably going to have a hard time finishing this (although I managed to make it through). Basically most of the characters just take it for granted that the Republicans are evil. But then again, maybe that isn't so far off the way Democratic operatives think (and vice versa).The story is entertaining, if somewhat predicatable. But not many of the characters have any real depth to them. The blurb on the cover compares Woods to Ludlum and Clancy. Although this is my first Stuart Woods novel, I have to say no way. In fact, as political thrillers go, this one is not even as good as James Huston's."
3,A GOOD READ,"Another great book by Stuart Woods. The suspense is wonderful and throughout the book Woods keeps you wanting more. My favorite Woods book is Dead Eyes, so read it if you like Woods."
2,Not What the Title Suggested.,"This book just didn't quite hit onto either of the reasons I purchased it. I bought this book on the basis of the title and the cover, which suggested it would be an interesting discussion of law, with, perhaps, a morbid thrill thrown in. This really isn't. What this book tends to be is a long examination of the history of women in medicine, and, more particularly, of one woman practicing in New York, who seems to quite possibly have been overpublished and undertalented, quick with the knife, and self-aggrandizing. If you are writing a treatise on the history of medicine and feminism, this would be an excellent work to refer to. If, like me, you picked it up as a lawyer or out of morbid curiosity, do yourself a favor and skip it, there's neither enough law nor enough gore to get you through the views on the advancement and development of gynecology as a specialty."
2,Stick with Court TV,"This is a very well-researched detective work on what in it's bare particulars is a complicated and powerful story in the annals of sexual politics, modern media and the darker recesses of professional medicine. However, what interest is inherent in this material is lost amid the author's refusal or inability to write in a direct, accessible manner. Academic history needs to be saved from academic prose -- this book is exhibit a."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was advertized as regarding the manslaughter and subsequent libel trials of Dr. Mary A. Dixon Jones in 1894. Based on the advertising, I expected the book to be about the two trials, the evidence involved and the courtroom machinations of the lawyers. Instead, it is a tiresome rendering of the history of gynecology, women's rights (or lack thereof), and disagreements in the medical profession. I found the style more academic than popular and suggest that the author was aiming more at the professional historian than the casual reader. Even for the professional historian, there is a great draught of facts surrounding the trials and there is more information on the history of gynecology as well as unproven speculation as to the effects of the trial on the medical community of Brooklyn."
5,please read this,Hi my name is Jenna Angelini and i have been looking all over the internet/web to see pictures and read all about Dalton James but nothing is working i get stuff that does not make sence and that does not say anything about him i want to read everything about him i am basicly in LOVE with him i think hes an awesome actor and hott to hehe well i loved YOU Dalton in My Father The Hero!

3,did they change the formula,"I have been using this product for 30yrs(yes really). This is not the same formula. It has that same stingy feeling of the non-aloe vera one, and that same sharp smell. I am not saying it's the seller's fault. Note to seller-can you ask TwinLab if they have changed this. If so, like they did with Coke, go back to the original formula..."
3,Too much mixing and matching,"Yes, there is such thing as ""too much of a good thing"". In Michael Flatley's case, the ""good thing"" is mixing and matching different dancing styles. He is notorious for breaking rules and pushing limits. Yet you can take Irish dancing only so far. Mr. Flatley's work in ""The Celtic Tiger"" is anything but Irish dancing. In fact, it hasn't been Irish dancing for a while. I keep thinking of that scene in the Budapest version of ""Feet of Flame"", where Cleopatra (former Morrigan) performs a delightful little strip tease to the sounds of flamenco.Michael, keep on doing what you do best, but don't call it ""Irish dancing""."
4,4.5 Stars,"Overall, very good production, as Michael Flately put forth yet another thrilling light, dance, and music show few (or no?) others can rival. If this is your first exposure to Michael Flately, this DVD is bound to glue you to your seat until the show is over.I would have given the DVD an unquestionable 5, except for several minor issues. Having viewed his incredible ""Feet of Flames"", this show falls just slightly below Feet of Flames, as that was one unsurpassable achievement by anyone, Michael Flately himself included. Also, there is just a little too much similarities between ""Feet of Flames"" and ""Celtic Tiger"" - several of the dance and compositions are nearly identical. At last, the show is a little bit too much ""Las Vegas"" than the genuine Irish dance show I was expecting... a few dance numbers stood out as ""out of place"".Nevertheless, there is more than enough here to keep almost anyone interested. Highly recommend this!"
2,Not like the other Michael Flatley shows.,Not as much tap dancing as the other ones. You probaly have to be Irish to understand the theme because I didn't.
3,Lacking,"Nowhere as good as Riverdance! Dancers did good, but there was no indication of the link between parts. A commentator would have helped."
2,Fading out.,"Celtic Tiger is really just a modified version of Feet of Flames of years ago. There is little new material or choreography, and it does not have the spectacular effect of Michael Flatley's earlier works. Sadly, Michael can no longer dance as he once did. It is a good effort, and certainly worth seeing, but don't expect to be electrified."
3,"Is not the same Flatley, definetly.","If you are expecting to see something -not better- but at least comparable to Feet of Flames, forget about it. This is a 100% Las Vegas show, and to be honest as a Las Vegas show is very good, but forget about all the art and ellegance of the 1998 Hyde Park concert. Celtic Tiger is a bunch of cheerleaders (and at one time even a striper!) jumping and dancing ryhtms taken from a Barney's childrens show. Flatley's dancing capabilities have considerably decreased. Is still good, just don't expect to see what you saw in Feet of Flames."
1,Disappointing,"Overly glitzy show that actually has very little to do with the history of the Irish nation. The musical numbers start off promisingly enough, but soon become overly long, deviating from the main concept of telling a story. There are stripteases, mediocre soloists, bikini clad women, bump and grinds, lot's of fire, smoke and glitz, glitz, glitz. Add that to Michael Flatley's ever growing ego, (and, my, does he enjoy displaying it onstage)and you have a very superficial hour and a half of rubbish."
1,I've never laughed so hard in my life,"Michael, Michael, Michael -- what in the hell went wrong with you when you decided to put a show like this together?. I can understand the idea of bringing in new dance forms for experimentation purposes. But the product that came out from this vision was absolutley ridiculous. For one I dont think it says much for ""lady liberty"" to do a strip tease and for two for Ireland to become the ""celtic kitten"". With 100% emphasis on sexuality -- this show is 100% horrible. I would never suggest this on anyone. And I think that Michael Flatley should hang up the shoes now and let a new handsome idiot take his place. In conclusion -- this show annoyed the hell out of me and I cannot believe that he even produced such a product."
3,mediocre show at best,"There are a few good sequences, but overall it is nothing like Riverdance or Lord of the Dance. The filming of the show is especially annoying. Every second or two they switch to a different shot. It's impossible to appreciate the dancing that way!"
5,"BRILLIANT , BREATHTAKING, BEAUTIFUL AND MUCH MORE","We saw the show in St. Louis and were spellbound. The DVD is wonderful. I love the dancing, the costumes, the music and the theme. The dancers in this show leave you breathless. There is some unbelievable footwork here. As a Michael Flatley fan, I was waiting anxiously for years for another show to add to my collection. I wanted something totally different from LOTD and FOF. This show is amazing. It is completely new yet equal to the previous two. Michael is brilliant and he is a creative genius. I recommend this highly to any Flatley fan. All I can say is THANK YOU Michael Flatley!!!!"
5,Performace With The Stregth of a Tiger,"My parents took me too this and I had once seen riverdance when i was younger and was amazed, but at 16 i thought it would be dumb. Was i wrong! This was the most amazing performance I've seen in my life, looking at it on DVD still gives me and my family goosebumbs its that amazing.The dancing goes through every type, Jazz, Hip-hop, R&B; to folk-dancing and each dance an amazing and well written story to go with it. A Must Own!"
1,Worst Ever,"I found this show to be the worst ever, Irish dancing teacher and fan of LOD & Feet of Flames, this was utter rubbish. Tacky tacky tacky. Theme was okay but strayed so far from irish dancing it was terrible. A stripper in it too, what the hell was the guy thinking??He's pulled far away from his famous Irish dancing to do this stuff which had I have know I wouldn't have wasted my money let alone bringing this in from overseas to view it.Best advice, save your money and enjoy all the other shows, this DVD is better used to sit my coffee cup on to stop it staining the table."
3,I disagree with some of the editorial review...,"To say that Michael Flatley is the, ""genius behind riverdance"" is a slap in the face of Moya Doherty who was the real genius behind Riverdance, and the woman who put Flatley on the map when she gave him the lead dance role.. For those who haven't seen ""Riverdance, A Journey"" (1996} It is a great video account of the beginning of Riverdance.. how it started.. the interviews, the whole deal from concept to the first New York show."
1,Horrible!,I bought this album for one song b.c. I was desperate. It is the only song that I listen to!
1,WHY WAS THIS CD NOT RELEASED IN AN EDITED VERSION TOO?,I had started to like Total when their single Kissin You came out on the radio and I loved it. But when Total's debut album came out I was disapointed to know that this cd did not have a edited version too. I know that Total's second album was edited too. But overall a great debut album for Total Get it
5,WESTERN ROUGHSHOOTER,"FINALLY, A BOOK NOT ONLY ABOUT THE TECHNICAL ASPECTS OF ROUGHSHOOTING, BUT ABOUT THE LIFESTYLE OF THE AMERICAN UPLAND BIRD HUNTER. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE BOOKS THAT I KEEP READING OVER AGAIN.THIS BOOK DELVES INTO WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT: DOGS, GUNS, BIRDS , AND THE STYLE IN WHICH ONE PURSUES THEM. IN PARTICULAR, IM GLAD TO SEE A BOOK ON UPLAND HUNTING THAT DOESN'T STATE ""THE 16 GAUGE IS OBSULETE"". MY ONLY CRITICAL ADVICE IS THAT HE OVERLOOKED THE WESTERN ROUGHSHOOTING (CALIFORNIA QUAIL, DOVE, CHUKER) THAT I ENJOY.IM WAITING FOR MR ROGGENCAMPS FOLLOW UP."
1,waste of time,This book is a slapped together rehash of how-to books on wingshooting. Two or three sections are unedited transcripts of interviews the author conducted with acknowledged experts. They may be experts but it sure makes for painful reading. Mr. Roggenkamp has a great enthusiasm for wingshooting that does come across. I liked his advice to hunt with the best gun you have - don't leave it in the cabinet and that a day in the field is more than a full limit. He seems like a nice guy but he is not a writer and this is not much of a book.
3,Coby MP-C888,"The product is good with some drawbacks. Given the number of songs the device can hold (240 or so) and the primitive user interface, the only rational way to use it is in shuffle mode. However, when the player is turned on it restarts at song 1 and plays them in the same order as before. So instead of listening to all 240 songs over a few days you listen to the same few hours worth. I don't know if they have access to a good random seed, but using one would make all the difference.I don't get a day's worth of listening out of a battery.On the plus side you don't need a cable to plug it into your computer. So, you don't have to worry about losing the cable."
4,Not bad for the price,I bought the Coby for my husband for his birthday. He was using a CD player on his way to work and now he just uses the Coby. The instructions aren't the best but he has found his way around it and enjoys it quite a bit. He says the sound quality is good too! The only thing is that the batteries don't last too long. Other than that it is great for the price. I am thinking of purchasing one for myself too! It is so compact he just puts it in his coat pocket and forgets about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a non-complicated mp3 player. It just serves its purpose which is to play your favorite songs on it.
1,terrible product,it does not work. I spent 20 maybe 30 hours and no luck. the guy from costumer service had no idea either. If you pay $5 for this mp3 that is $5 too much. The worst thing I've ever got
1,Horrible experience with this product and the Coby company,"I recently bought 4 of these mp3 players. I had bought one and thought it was pretty neat, so I bought three more (one for my wife and two as gifts). Within a couple of weeks, however, each one had started to malfunction in different ways. I was quite upset, so I returned them to Coby and requested a refund. The Coby company refused a refund, never sent any replacements, and the elusive person who was the only one who could authorize a refund was conveniently always ""in a meeting"" when I called. I am now out more than $120 dollars with no explanation or apology from the Coby company, much less a working mp3 player. I would highly recommend NOT buying this product!!"
2,Can only fit 1/4 the amount of music as it says it can!,"I like it - it's simple and easy to use - but the memory is actually only 230,000 kilobyes, not 1 gigabyte as advertised. I can't imagine that the software that runs it takes up 75% of the available memory so basically this is false advertising. I'm going to take mine back and get one that can actually fit the amount of information it says it can."
4,Only missing one thing!,"This is a fantastic collection, but it's missing ""Strange Love"" the gloriously cheesy theme from Lust for a Vampire, performed by ""Tracy!"" Anyone else know of a collection that does include this track?"
5,Read It,"There is little I can add to the existing reviews save yet another resounding confirmation of this book's brilliance. Konin is a superbly written, award-winning thing translated into Polish, Hebrew, German and Italian.The book is impeccable stylistically and intellectually, and the thorny issue of Polish-Jewish relations is penetrated with honesty and insight. The people interviewed and depicted in the book are -- well, simply, REAL."
5,Well worth reading,I found this book absolutely fascinating. My Grandmother came from Konin so for me it was a look into the world my Grandmother left behind.
5,Tight,"Biggie used this Isley Brothers Classic Properly to me.Biggies take on ""Between the Sheets""&He knocked this Jam out.Biggie could FLow on anything&was very skilled at bringing His Vibe.this is a Tight Jam still."
4,A great book outlining the complicated history of dinosaurs.,"This book is full of maps and charts on when, where, and how the dinosaurs lived. It is an excellent resource for seriously interested people. The only thing I didn't like about it were the sometimes misleading illustrations. If I remember correctly, Tyrannosaurus is pictured with three manual digits."
3,"A good read.............. however, not very deep","Benton does a good job giving an overview of when and where dinosaurs roamed the earth. The art needed a little more attention to detail and the maps could have been more precise for my taste. But, all in all, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to all."
1,Utterly useless junk.,Nice kit and case but that's about it. The butane iron is hard to light and hard to keep lit. Skip this and go buy something more dependable since time is money.
5,Great Work!,"This is truly an amazing album. Though it is different from Rusted Roots other albums, fans will not be disapointed. In a word, beautiful. Absolutely and completely beautiful. Buy this album, you will not be disapointed. What a creative band!"
5,"Like rain after the ""Remember"" drought","My first RR cd, ""When I Woke"", is still the only one I've never gotten tired of. As a fan who was pretty disappointed in ""Remember"", I couldn't be happier with ""Welcome"". For me Remember lacked groove-ability...I have no doubt that it was a sincere recording...but not my cup of tea. I would love to see the Welcome songs performed live; this album has totally renewed my interest in this excellent band. Basically, if you like to dance at the concerts (or in your house), definitely check out Welcome. ""Cry"" is the only track I'm not into; the high pitched vocals are irritating. Still, one not-so-great out of a whole album is a lot more than can be said for most music releases. Oh-and I feel the lyrics are much stronger here in that I can understand them without the liner notes. Whatever, to each her own, but I prefer to be reminded of how awesome their lyrics are on a constant listening basis. Why obscure genius?"
2,Terribly disappointing cd,"I've seen the band live 5 or 6 times since the mid 90's. Everytime, except for the last time I saw them (on tour for this record) was exceptional. Not only was the concert lackluster, but the cd was worse. Honestly not a single song on this cd impressed me enough to want to listen to it again. The songs seem ...forced. After a few weeks of giving it a chance, I gave up. I can't recommend this cd to anyone. Get Cruel Sun or When I Woke and leave it at that."
2,They have done much better in the past,"I am a big Rusted Root fan and have been for several years, but I was left disappointed with this effort from the group. The umph was missing in this disc. If you like some of their original stuff but are sick of listening to the same 4 CDs over and over again, check out some of their live stuff."
4,They are hear to stay!,"If you liked the old Rusted Root with Jenn Wertz and the first two albums then this is a must purchase for you! I've been a lover of Rusted Root since the beginning and living only 30 miles away from their home city of Pittsburgh I have seen them play dozens of time as a group and jamming at Club Cafe on the South Side. Last fall when I saw Wertz back with the group at a small little pub I knew they were back on track. They are on top form with this album... it has hints of Cruel Sun yet it is distinctly its own album. Some of the songs are uterly amazing, such as ""Blue Diamonds"" and their is not a bad song on the album. I must admit the last two albums they did kind of spooked me but I still liked them, but Welcome To My Party is music to my ears I would rank it along with Trey Anastasio's new album the best music I've prurchased in several years."
2,Hmm.....,"I am actually quite disappointed in their albums after their big ""Ice Age"" break. I feel like they lost their roots!!!!And in 2003 I saw them in concert.... I could not believe how trendy and popish the girls were dressed. I have been a long time fan of their music. I saw them in '96 when I was a young teenager and loved them!But I could not believe when I saw them in concert that the girls sold out like that. Their more recent songs sound so ""poppy"" and not so much of their old stuff. There are maybe one or two songs but the rest.... they might as well have asked Britney Spears to join the group.If you want to fully taste and embrace Rusted Root at their finest, purchase When I Woke... and stay away from the pop albums."
2,"Still can't come close to ""When I Woke""","Perhaps I am spoiled by ""When I Woke"", but once again Rusted Root failed to excite me with the CD, though I desperately wanted them to succeed. I believe the band's strength lies in improvising and jamming, upbeat songs. But, for the last 3 CD's they have slowed things down considerably, I and just cannot get into it. Things start great with ""Union 7"", but go downhill from there. If you want something like ""When I Woke"", this isn't it."
3,What happened to their primal scream?,"This album offers much less of the driving drum beat and haunting vocals that made Rusted Root one of my favorites. It is a solid, mellow (almost R&B) alternative, but it probably won't get as much play on my stereo as their earlier albums."
2,Too slow for my taste--never finished,"By the time I got to page 50, I realized that I was skipping pages here and there, so I didn't bother finishing. Too much background, I guess."
3,Jesus in Egypt . . . . by Paul Perry,"The book is interesting. Most of it is collected legends at the various locations claiming. Though it may be documenting a very good commercial travel program most Egyptians - Muslim and Coptic Christians - take pride in the fact that Jesus and his parents chose Egypt as a safe haven. If you visit Cairo and take in the Pharionic Village the museum there has a good summary of that special visitors travel.Inasmuch as the Coptic Church, oldest of Aramaic speaking churches, documents the event historically a certain level of credibility supports Perry's effort. The book is worth a good look.Amazon carries a significant number of books related to Aramaic study and many students appreciate these resouces."
5,Great belt quality,"I`m very please with this belt. I ended up tring the Gator back belt from Good Year. but this one looks very good. It fit my 1998 Altima GXE WP,ALT, PS."
4,ADDAMS FAMILY,Every one knows that the real addams family are the best from all the rest. Great Movie.
4,St Croix USVI Bike-o-vision,"Iexpected more flowers and beach, but the view was still beautiful. Did have to work past feeling I'd go off the road if I looked at the scenery instead of the pavement, but finally convinced myself nothing would happen. Scenery reminded me of SE Oklahoma, though."
2,"confusing, with limited life span","We put a couple of these rather high end fans and controllers in our newly renovated kitchen and dining room. They work relatively well. However, after less than 2 y of daily use, the large buttons plastic buttons become less responsive, and the more you push them the worse they get. [...]."
1,SW350 review,"I bought 2 of these wall control units. In a little over 1 year of use (just past the warranty), the mechanical buttons no longer work. The electronics are fine, but the button for the light gets progressively harder to operate with time until it no longer works at all. This is a piece of junk."
5,fantastic,"I suggest with any purchase like this, always get a jeweler to give you a correct size measure. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,"Excellent, Uplifting, Encouraging Book!","Joy. Now there's a word that few of us really understand. This book defines it in ways that we all ""get"". It's the little things that bring us joy and happiness, not the great monumental mountain-top moments. Being held by a loved one when we're unloveable in one story that comes to mind. I highly recommend this book as a stress reliever and a spirit uplifter!"
5,Exceeds Expectations,"We received our 6 pc bedding set in just a week or two. When it arrived, I found the colors to be warmer than thought from the picture. I was surprised by the suede trim and patches which make up the ""cowboy"" features. This is much nicer than I expected. Seems to be of good quality and is just adorable."
4,Richard Zorza Comments,"I am the son refered to in the review.Please note that this book is available for individual noncommerical use on the web athttp://www.zorza.net/resources/waytodieI have only filled in 4 stars since this is a required field, and the prior review gave this number. It is not for me to give a rating."
1,Shallow story and insipid prose make a classic mediocrity.,"I do not like light-weight ""mysteries"" or suspense stories, of which this novel is a paradigm. The protagonist tries to be witty, in a kind of purified, decadent French way, but she still sounds like a hick from upstate New York. Her relationship with her lazy employee (Derek) would only work if she had a good, meaty affair with him. The story pooh-poohs the presence of a recreation hall for seriously ill men and women. Only a fool would not object to a facility that is designed for failure: the mentally ill will be allowed to wander in and out of this playground. The plot moves along ""smoothly"" with no edge, no suspense, leaving the reader numbed from its extreme dullness."
2,"cheap, writes well","This pen is VERY cheap. It feels so light, I worry it would blow away if I left it outside. Also its very ugly, and definitely will NOT win you any style points. It writes well, and consistent and you have to really TRY to get it to bleed (by coloring in the same spot for a long time). I don't like the way it scratches the paper. It feels like a cheap marker.Honestly if I need something that writes well and does not bleed, I'd rather just use a pencil."
3,Not the same when Dave isn't doing it live,"Some of the lists are very funny, but it's missing something in book form because you're missing Dave's delivery. Also, a one-joke book gets kind of thin quick. I recommend only reading three or four lists at a time so the novelty doesn't wear off. Great bathroom reading."
2,Aquired taste?,There's mabie a hand full of the list's that I thought were funny & a few had potential but for me most of them were for me pretty stupid.
2,Living Abroad in Belize,"I think if this was my only source of information on moving to Belize, I would discontinue entertaining the idea. Fortunately for us, there are other sources of information out there. It is still full of valuable, yet biased information. If you can look past the editorizing(?).Good for balanced information only."
1,A sham!,"This book purports to be written by someone who left their regular life to move to Belize and start a new one. However by the authors own admission, he does not live in Belize, has no plans to live in Belize, and only visits there occasionally.Yet, he is going to give advise on what the experience is like and how to do it?This is a joke!"
3,The lowdown on Belize,"I went to Belize in 2002 with the ""Retire in Belize for $450/month"" tour. Belize is a dump compared to Mexico. Petty theft is rampant. The natives hate Americans as much as any place in the world. The people who aspire to live there are mostly wannabe tax evaders and deadbeats escaping the bill collector. It's hurricane territory. Malaria! There are few bargains to be had. Besides the fact that English is spoken, Belize is attractive only to world-class windsurfers. Learn Spanish and stick to Mexico. Hope I saved you some trouble."
4,A good start to an excellent series,"Buffy summers our intrepid heroin arrives in sunnydale, the hellmouth for the first time, and as well as having to slay vampires (for she is the chosen one), she has the even herder task of making friends!This is a good clear series opener, giving us all the details about Buffy and the Series basis. There is action, humour and Sarah michelle gellar looking stunning as always! Buy this video! It is by no means the best episode, but no Buffy fan should be without this feature length opener. ENJOY!"
5,cool,Buffy the vampire slayer is my favorite show! David Boreanez is my favorite actor! This video is my favorite of all the others!
2,Not enough combat detail,"Most of the book involves biographies of officers rather than the enlisted grunts. There was a lot of information on who commanded what unit, other officers they knew, and higher command info that was extremely boring. It seems like the majority of the writing is about the pre-war homelife of the individuals, including where they went to school, their marriages, where they worked, etc. I was hoping for detailed combat information about the Pacific war, but the majority of this book will keep you looking someplace else."
3,Not a big picture but a ground view,Some books explain the big view of history. However I often prefer the view of the small eye witness. This book is basically transcribed interviews of selected veterans. Something like a guy or two reminiscing over drinks. Some are priceless.
3,Direct Connect Convenient But...,"This is a decent saw. The only problem with them is the direct plug feature. It is nice to plug your extension cord directly into your circ saw but this feature will wear out with use. You'll end up have to gut the direct connect and add a cord to your saw. Or, like a lot of people do, just junk it. I would highly recommend the Skil HD77. Top quality saw that's built like a tank. It is rather heavy, tops out over 16lbs I believe. If that's too heavy go with the Skil HD77m. Much of the steel is replaced with magnesium alloy. This sacrifices some durability but cuts the weight of the saw down by 2lbs."
3,Technical Comment,"I read the reviews and bought the disc. Nice, clean but lacking much surround sound due to faint rear channeloutput unlike a recent purchase of a Mel Torme disc.Max YoungRichmond VA"
1,OUCH!,"This one's a total waste of time. Sorry guys, don't bother - even as infant books go this is bad."
4,It's Magnum!,You can't go wrong with Tom Selleck! The only thing I would add is more Tom Selleck. ;)
3,Slow delivery,"It was a gift so I don't know about the condition it arrived in, but I haven't heard any complaints so I think the condition was fine. However, it was SLOW to arrive. Missed my brother's birthday by a couple of weeks."
2,"Wonderful show, but very poor quality DVD's!","I completely agree with the previous reviewer. I think Magnum, P.I. is a fantastic show, one that I definitely wanted to own on DVD. I had previously bought the first two seasons and had no problems with the DVDs. However, I've had nonstop problems with the discs from Season 3. Many episodes skip terribly, or stop in the middle and bring you back to the menu screen. One episode won't play at all! I'm extremely frustrated trying to watch these DVDs, and I feel ripped off. For all the money these sets cost, you'd expect them to be top quality! It's too bad for such a great show."
2,"Excellent content, lousy format","At this point, sales of the show on DVD pretty much represent pure profit to Universal - so it is incomprehensible that they were trying to save money by releasing this on lousy quality, double-sided discs. Never had so many problems playing DVDs. Five stars for the show, zero stars for the physical discs. A real shame..."
1,Buyer Beware,"Sadly, it is a mistake to purchase ANY of the Magnum series. You can never be sure what you will get; these are the lowest possible quality products. I have season 1,2 and 3. With 1, there are 3 episodes that will not play. Season 2 has 2 episodes that will not play, and season 3 all of disc 2 will not play. It is a disgrace that Universal has done such a miserable job with such a great tv show. But save your money."
5,"Magnum, P.I. - Third Season","For anyone who grew up loving ""Magnum"", this series is a BIG winner. I've purchased all three season sets and each season gets better. Can't wait for the fourth season to be released!"
1,Angry,"I purchased this item in good faith and when it did not arrive prior to christmas, I emailed the person who I believe was the seller to let them know that I never received the Magnum PI Third Season that I had ordered. I have never heard another word. So I am very dissatisfied and upset."
5,OUR HERO!!,"Those of us who were fortunate enough to know Colonel Bank in his later years applaud the author for this in depth story of a great man. Colonel Bank was our security officer at Beach Road Community and at age 80 was a tough enforcer. He would go out on the beach at night and confront any situation with a military bearing and confidence that brought any situation to an early and successful conclusion. Late in life, Col. Bank was always fit and quick witted..........he never let us know the true nature of his military heroics. Thank you for the book.....Pete Siracusa"
5,"Enlightening, Entertaining and Fascinating","This is the ""untold story of the ORIGINAL Green Berets, written by one of those originals, Edward F. Fitzgerald. It's dedicated to and includes stories about Aaron Banks, the ""father of the Green Berets."" I now have a greater appreciation of the Green Berets. Although this is written as a novel, the names of the participants are changed to protect the innocent, but the events are real. This combination of fact and fiction gives the reader an insight into the training events and the actual encounters. It opened my eyes to the courage and sacrifices these men were and are currently all about. I recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know anything about the Green Berets, and to all those who do. It's a keeper. Raleigh Pinskey"
1,substance free,I learned nothing from this book. It simply tells you what is required by the exam and where to find information sources. This book is a glorified outline of exam 70-224 and that is all.
5,What a blessing!,This album exceeded our expectations - Kathy Troccoli's music is so anointed! Vendor was fine to work with - no issues.
2,Love the head... problem is that's all you get (picture WRONG),"Don't make the same mistake I made. Unless you are only looking for the head pictured in this image.I love the SLIK tripod head, don't get me wrong. But the picture leads you to believe you are getting the whole tripod. Wonder how many they've tripped up with this image.Amazon, fix the image please. Just show the head to reduce confusion."
4,I think its a unique CD. It makes you stop and think.,Very interesting to listen to on the sofa on sunday afternoon
1,NOT acceptable!,"The book was not acceptable! The entire cover was torn, the first few pages were filthy and most of the book was dog-eared. Why do these sellers assume we consumers want their trash? Will be more careful the next time!"
3,It's okay,"This book arrived in fine shape. This was my first book to read of the series and I was disappointed. The story theme is okay but all in all it seemed rather childish. By the end of the book, it had improved a bit, but I won't read more of the series."
2,just okay...,"I agree with another reviewer - the reading is trite and monotonous, to the point I was skimming. It lacks characters, plot and writing with any kind of depth. It is definitely a simple read to the point it offends the reader. The cover is the best thing about this book. I am a beekeeper so it was nice to have hives talked about. But like everything else, it is just the surface. The characters, settings, and storylines are too cliche. Stick with Mitford."
1,Disappointing,"Disappointing. I could not finish it. I'd seen it compared to Jan Karon's Mitford series and I loved those books. This was like a flat, pale attempt at imitation, and one that tried too hard. While I've seen these characters described as quirky, I saw very little character development and nothing to make me care about them. I think what was most difficult for me was the strange mix of tenses. It wasn't a first person narrative, but the mix of tenses was odd and incredibly distracting.The book has received other, very positive, comments and I have no doubt that it will appeal to many people. I'm just not one of them."
1,The most insipid book on which I have ever wasted money.,"If you are in the 7th grade, you might like this book. My guess is that Gail Fraser has not spent any time in the northwest. For example, no one who lives in Eastern Washington would say ""let's go the west coast."" It is also poorly researched. Towns have police chiefs, counties have sheriffs, yet the town of Lumby has a sheriff. On the Sheriff's report printed in the Lumby newspaper, a 20 year old is cited for driving intoxicated, but not for being a minor in possession. These types of errors make the book less believable. In fact, does Ms. Fraser live in this country? One expects the characters to start jumping up and down clap their hands and say ""oh, goody."" This book is sophomoric and insipid."
4,a sort of history of the town of Lumby,"This was an interesting book to read. The people are interesting. The situations are reasonable. It is something of a nothing story, a sort of history of the town of Lumby and how a married couple came to buy and rebuild a monastery outside of town. It is a bit too simple, though. There are no real harrowing incidents and no real tragedies, just people rebuilding the monastery, others falling in love, others starting a business, etc., and it all works out like you would want it to. There are no problems or hassles and the money never seems to be a real issue."
2,Not quite what I expected.,"After reading all of the Jan Karon books (from a town called ""Mitford"")....twice, I was anxious to read the ""Lumby"" series. I'm glad I just got the first book to read before ordering more. While I found the main characters interesting, and Montis Abby unique, I thought the word choices were trite, typical,and monotonous. There didn't seem to be the joy and spontaneity that the ""Mitford"" series has."
2,"Not Philip Gulley, not Lake Wobegone","I bought this thinking, hoping, it was an Oregon version of Harmony or Lake Wobegone. But the writing is so heavy on expository and so lacking in narrative charm, I had to give it up. She writes like an accountant."
4,Good First of the Series,"I have just discovered the ""Lumby"" series. This was a good first book and to be sure I will read the next in the series. Lots of interesting people ""live"" in Lumby. I can't wait to see how the subjects interact with each other."
5,Refreshing,"I usually read mysteries,but liked getting caught up in the lives of little Lumby. I'm already reading Stealing Lumby."
4,Cage your cell phone,"This is an excellent solution for those than carry cellphones in jersey pockets. I found that mine collects moisture. This cage is nice place to secure the phone. The plastic insert is worthless as it gets crumpled to the bottom of the cage in no time. I found that I can put a smartphone and a tube in the cage, no problem. It's easy to open as you ride, too."
4,Utilitarian but useful and well-made,"I've been using the Cage Rocket for the past 6 months for my bike commute and it's perfect for my (modest) storage needs. Big enough for keys, ID holder and a cell phone (iPhone and Droid will fit), the padding minimizes any rattling around. So far no problems with water leakage from the rain, or any cracks or brittleness from the cold (coldest ride so far was 8F). My only caveat is that the Cage Rocket only fits certain types of water bottle cages, I had to replace my cage to get it to fit."
2,Not Standard Water Bottle Size,"I wanted to use this to carry my iphone, spare tube, tire irons, maybe keys and patch kit. It actually did, with a little jimmying to fit the phone into the tube. However, it simply does not fit into lightweight (plastic) bottle cages, and maybe not into any cages without opening them up a little. I tried to put mine in, and ""snap"" (literally, snap!) it broke an arm on the bottle cage.It might be that with metal cages, you can bend the arms open and put the container in; however, I would worry about it bouncing out."
3,Nice gadget,"Nice little gadget. I think it will look better painted, not a very pretty black color. Not sure how it will hold up, the lid seems kind of weak."
1,have not received product,"I ordered this product well before christmas,yet I still have not received it. I have an email out to the company and I hope to learn more soon"
4,max is terrific,"""Bang,"" said Max has been a family expression for many years, but we lost or gave away our copy ""Max's First Word"" years ago. The book is as wonderful as we remembered. The particular copy I bought was in pretty ragged shape, but I knew that would be the case - it only cost 99cents. And that the book was well used tells me that someone else loved it as much as we do."
3,VERY DIFFICULT TO READ,"Our 14 month daughter loves this book but we hate it. The story is cute and she loves the pictures but it is very difficult to read. The words do not flow and I found myself having to read it slowly because what I was reading did not sound right. The sentence POT,Max,said Ruby. BANG,said Max is harder to read out loud than you think. Your child will probably love it , you probably won`t."
2,not as vivid as his another album also named unadorned,"This one is slow and sleepy, boring and tedious."
2,Review of Twin Lab No-Flush Niacin,"I purchased this product from your vendor, AllStarHealth.com, because it was cheaper than the Vitamin Shoppe where I had purchasd it before. I think the reason it was cheaper was because the product is old. The safety cap came off in the lid indicating to me that it was old and dried out. I will use what I purchased, but will not order from this vendor again. I am not being critical of Twin Labs but, rather, of AllStarHealth.com."
4,Not bad for the money,"Although this pan is a bit small, it is a perfect size if cooking for 1 or 2 people. The pan heats up quickly and cooks evenly. I use this pan in our vacation home on an apartment size electric stove (with the coils). I tossed my old stir fry pan due to uneven heating and this one seems to work just fine. Good price for a Calphalon pan."
3,stir fry pan,"Heavier than I expected, the handle was unweildy and difficult to grip. Not very steady either. Good, even heating, the food that I prepared came out well. The small size was handy, but it was heavier than I had hoped - I have arthritis, and the pan was heavy for it's size."
3,Too Small,I like the stir fry pan and it works great but the size is too small. Would of bought a bigger one but didn't see one at the time
3,Not as big,"I was a little disappointed in the fact that the product wasn't as big as I thought. I haven't used it yet but, given that some of my meal will be just for one I suppose it's ok."
2,Too narrow bottom,The small bottom causes this to heat very slowly on an electric stove; would be better with a gas stove.
4,Good Value,"Good value for the money.It was smaller than I had imagined it. Remember its 9"" on top and tapers down. Good quality product.Great for preperation of a side or dinner for one or two people."
2,Too small,It is non-stick and so small it makes one serving of a veggie filled stir-fry. I was so shocked when I got it I had to show how dumb of a pan it was to all the people on the elevator at my apartment LOL. So if it say 9 1/2 inches don't buy it.
4,Old gods,"This is a pretty decent compilation of the Young God's music. It contains the best stuff they have done. The problem has allways been that besides a few excellent tracks, thier albums have been difficult to listen to in whole, partly due to the experimentation but also to the fact that they sound the same and tire you out. Anyway they have donce some really great stuff such as l'amourir and gaoline man that are really worth looking at. Even if at the time it was maybe not that evident, they have influenced almost everybody in recent years who has been doing industrial electronic music. Their best singles are both powerful and beautiful."
5,Great Conversation,"The act of reading has been mistakenly called solitary. It is all about dialogue and this book has it in spades. Michael Ondaatje and fellow editors from Brick Magazine, a literary journal, invited over 70 past contributors to submit essays singing the praises of lost, long-ago, out-of-print or underrated books that mattered. In other words, it is a collection of love stories, all personable and short. It is a delight on several levels: not only does it suggests some good-sounding reads, it also introduces some interesting reader/writers, many of them Canadian who do not get enough recognition in America."
4,Be careful of typos!,"This book provides a speedy but readable and comprehensive approach to financial math. For a slower and more careful approach to the mathematics, especially with regard to local martingales and the construction of the stochastic integral, I recommend Steele. An important warning about the 2nd edition of Elliott and Kopp is that Chapter 7, the longest and most important chapter in the book, which covers continuous time European options and the Greeks, is *rife* with typos: incorrect subscripts, superscripts and signs, mixed up or missing variables in expressions, backwards inequalities, etc. This chapter was clearly not edited carefully, and can be a little frustrating to read."
5,Excellent - Good Mathematical Level,"Does an excellent job of presenting the mathematics WITH RIGOR. The mathematics is more mature than Bingham & Kiesel, but the book is more accessible and far more readable than the similar texts by Karatzas & Shreve and Musiela & Rutkowski."
1,sized too large to fit zen v plus,The overlay for the Zen V doesnt fit. It's way too large so it doesnt lay flush.
3,installing kitchen cabinets and countertops,"it seem to have some sets missing.i feel there should be better directions on how to cut the perfect sink and faucet hole to match the plumbing,for beginner."
3,Helpful but lacking.,while this will help you some it is not really worth the money. It is not detailed enough and glosses over key information. A little like watching a DIY show where they go from start to finish in 20 minutes.
1,Product is a Sham -- Picture is deceptive,"Contrary to the picture when I bought it, this is just the drill bit case. There are no drill bits included."
5,Thoughtful and enchanting short stories.,"These short stories are an excellent description of human emotions. The different points of view of the characters within stories are well presented. The many different characters and locations are beautifully and fully captured. The stories are definitely not all 'upbeat', but they will intrigue you. A good choice when you want to 'get away' for a little while.The book itself is lovely and well made, and the introduction provides information about the author."
4,A must read for those who dare to dream,Mr. Adi Kohler is a true pioneer whose story will inspire and help all understand the spirit of Aloha (no matter where you collect your post).
1,Horrible product,"Don't waste your money. This polish is really thin for a UV top coat. I tried it on my acrylic nail and it was super thin and not even close to a ""diamond"" finish. I added 3 more coats and nothing. Plus after 3 days the color started to yellow big time. I will not not ever buy this crap again!"
5,This was a great book. I know how to hunt snows now.,"This was another great book by DENNIS HUNT. I know how to hunt snows now because I learned what equipment I need, what kind of concealment to use, how to set my decoys up, what kind of stratagies to use, where to hunt and when, I learned when to call and when not to, I learned about shooting too and even got some receipes."
5,I am ready for the snow!,A lot of good information was in this book. It is well written with some humor. I liked - Robo Duck. There is a lot of truth to it. The chapters on decoy and receipes were great also.
5,The book was outstanding and really helped me this spring!!!,There were so many good things in this book that helped me become a better snow goose hunter.
1,disgusting,"While I was not offended by the profanity which Barry warned about in the foreward, I was disgusted by the bodily functions that consumed this book. Barry spent 2 whole pages on vomit...which I almost did after reading it. There was nothing even remotely funny in this scene (and most of the book). The only reason I finished the book is because I don't believe someone should rate a book without actually having read it. I will NOT be reading anymore of Barry's books."
1,Vile,"I love Dave Barry's weekly column in the paper, and I really liked his prior novel, Big Trouble. His book Dave Barry Does Japan is also a wonderful read. So, by any standard I'd be called a Dave Barry fan. I was severly disappointed to find I hated this book. It was vile and disgusting. In the beginning of the book, there is a disclaimer about the book containing bad words. Okay, fine, no problem there. The book should have had a disclaimer worded something like this: ""This book contains graphic and gratuitous depictions of torture, and very little humor"". Then I would have skipped the whole thing and saved myself from being deeply disturbed."
1,Tricky Business,"I read this book because it was picked for our Book Club. I found nothing funny in this book. It was absurd. I guess I am one of the ""uptight"" readers! If you want to be entertained, find another book!"
3,Big Trouble is HILARIOUS!,"Dave Barry's ""Big Trouble"" is one of the funniest novels I've ever read. Unfortunately, this is a review for Tricky Business. It's still kind of funny, but it's not as fresh and surprising as Big Trouble is. It's also a lot more ""adult"" -- a lot more sex and adult language/violence than Big Trouble. It feels like a little too much for a supposedly light, humourous romp.The book also recycles more of Barry's humour column material -- like funny band names, etc.It's an easy, light read, but if you can only read one Dave Barry novel, pick Big Trouble."
3,Good but not great,"I considered 4 stars, but settled on three since Big Trouble set such a high bar. This is a very readable book, with lots of engaging fun, but I expected - like Big Trouble - a tightly orchestrated slam bang book. It's a fast, good but not great read (look at the re-sale prices). The reviews that knock the book for language and ""vileness"" are over-reacting. It's got nastiness, but all in context and not gratuitous. I can only hope that a movie treatment, if there is one, comes up with more riotous interaction."
4,Good but his comedy work is better,"Dave is stretching and it isn't as good as his first book, but I did like it. There is a warning in the front of the book that this one contains bad language, and he isn't kidding. I'm a fan of murder mysteries and there is some mystery here, but not a lot. I like those werid Floridain mobster kill/sex/drugs books, and there are a number of them but this one is better than those. At least the comdeic elements can make you laugh, although if this were to really happen, no one would be laughing. So if you liked Big Trouble you'll like this one."
4,My Funny? Valentine,"If you enjoyed ""Big Trouble"", you'll love ""Tricky Business."" Bathroom humor notwithstanding, (there is a warning at the beginning), Dave Barry succeeds again with a bunch of wacky characters who find themselves thrown together on a casino ship. The band's rendition of the song ""My Funny Valentine"" is particularly hilarious."
2,WARNING: Scenes of physical torture!,"WARNING: This book is not a light-hearted comedy. It contains graphic descriptions of physical torture. (And, as the author often says in his columns, I am not making this up.)If you can tolerate that, the humor in the rest of this disturbing and disappointing book is worth two stars."
2,"Dave, you disappoint me.","I was really disappointed in Dave with this book. He is my favorite writer, and this one doesn't meet his standard of intelligent humor. I was hoping for the best after his wonderful Big Trouble, but Tricky Business is not close. To give you a hint: the f-word is used on almost every page. To quote Mr. Barry, I am not making this up! The situations are hilarious in concept, but the writing of the situations is pretty bad. The swearing does not help the writing sound intelligent. I'll give him this though; several scenes did make me laugh out loud, and the whole subplot of the two escaped senior citizens is hilarious the whole way through. Overall, however, I recommend his books of columns first and Big Trouble second."
2,Filthy Language Ruins What Could Have Been a Great Read.,"From the start Mr. Barry warns the reader that this book contains foul language and that if one is offended by such language then don't read it. While I am no prude when it comes to obscene language I do believe that this book goes over the top. Rather than write a better description of the characters and their surroundings he just goes the easy route and throws in a huge dose of bad words. The best part of the book occurs when the old retired gentlemen are in the picture. The most amusing part is where the two make their escape from the retirement home to be able to board the Extravaganza of the Seas. I wish the book had focused on these two even more and less on the sexual prowess of the band. If you like a filthy read then this is the book for you, otherwise I'd say skip it."
2,Too crude,"I love Dave Barry's humor columns, and I really enjoyed his first novel, ""Big Trouble."" But this one was too crude for me. Maybe Dave has written for the newspaper censors so long that he had a lot of dark ideas waiting to get out.It has been some time since I read this, but I remember feeling that the cursing and sexual content were a lot stronger than they had to be to move the story along.The writing is compelling; the story is interesting and grisly way that one of the characters dies still makes me shudder to remember. But that sort of thing isn't my cup of tea.For me, ""Big Trouble"" was a lot funnier and also had a great plot. Dave's best asset is his amazing sense of humor, and his characters are more believable because of the goofy thoughts that go through their heads, even in serious situations.I hope Dave keeps writing novels, but I wish he'd lighten up on the adult-only content."
3,It's pretty gross,"As a parody it's not very funny, but it's too silly to be taken seriously as a crime novel. Parts of it may make you smile. It's a good book to pass the time in a waiting room, as long as you have a strong stomach!"
2,bad novel from a good writer,"I guess this is supposed to be a comedic farce but I really wasn'table to laugh at it after the one character brutally castrates andmurders another.I've read some Elmore Leonard stuff and this isn't even close. I getthe idea the author is trying to write the kind of snappy crimefiction Leonard is known for, but the voicing is just off.The book wants to be a farce, and the final third of it, asconflict comes to a head and the bullets fly, does have afarcical quality. I enjoyed the film version of ""Big Trouble""(didn't read the book) which, perhaps due to inspired direction,was a light crime farce.Really a poor novel, but not too tedious because Barry does havea thread of breezy wit in his writing style. I question hischoice of how he's gone about writing in the crime genre here."
4,Lost At Sea,"I'll admit it. I'm a Dave Barry addict. I read the columns on line and have read most if not all of the books he's written.Certainly, this one has some funny moments. But it feels like Barry is torn between trying to produce a serious thriller and a book based on his tried and true humor. Personally I'd rather he just stuck to the humour -- when reading his books becomes more business than pleasure, it's time to get back to the basics.It's not that you won't enjoy this book -- you will -- and that's what I'm giving it four stars. But the laughs are few and far between; it's not the Barry I've come to know and love."
3,Enjoy It For What It Is,"If you want to read a fun story that is an easy read and will make you laugh, pick up this book and enjoy yourself. If you are looking for serious literature with important insights on the human condition and the meaning of life, I suggest you look elsewhere.This funny story set on a gambling boat sailing in a hurricane is quite witty and creative. Along the way Barry manages to skewer local news broadcasters, organized crime, backsliding professional musicians, senior citizens, and the primal urge to gamble.The story itself which involves underworld drug dealing and profit skimming along with an action plot isn't all that important. It's merely there to give Barry an opportunity to make funny observations and create memorable characters.The bottom line is that it's funny but I'm not sure I would recommend paying the full hardcover price for it. [...]"
2,Sophomore slump?,"I enjoyed Big Trouble a lot, but this one didn't grab me as much. Well, I guess it still GRABBED me, as the plot kept motoring along and I wanted to know what would happen next... but I didn't enjoy it as much. And I think the main reason was the gratuitous violence. There really is too much of it, and it's too graphic. Stomach-churning, literally. The old farts from the nursing home are a riot, however. (And they're not involved in any of the violence!)"
3,Tricky Business,Not something I would normally read but gave it a go as I like dave Barry. The book was good and kept me interested to the end.
3,Good but mediocre compared to others,"I found Barry an entertaining read, but didn't have the ""bite"" of a Hiassen or Dorsey."
4,Very funny,"Dave Barry has done it again! A hysterical glimpse into a very strange night on a casino ship. Not for the weak stomached, as there's a pretty gruesome vomiting scene, and some other stuff pretty high on the blood-and-guts meter. Dave Barry pokes fun at sensationalist newscasts, rock bands, the preparation for storms, and just about anything else you can think of."
2,"Clumsily written, wierdly violent, a little funny.","There's no question that there were some really funny moments in Tricky Business. And, excepting some really grotesque dipcitions of torture, it's a light, easy read, which I suppose was the goal. But as much as the plot came together, the writing didn't. Barry drifts between slapstick comedy, sappy romantisism, and noir crime novel violence.The changes in voice and style were sudden, and completely unconnected from the story. It kept me from getting lost in the story in a way that I wanted to. I was always aware that this was an effort - ""Ah, Dave's trying to be funny. Ah, Dave's trying to be a serious writer. Ah, Dave's making fun of South Florida.Not bad for a couple hours of diversion, but one could certainly do a whole lot better with an author who knew what he was trying to write."
2,"Say it ain't so, Dave.","I'm a big fan of Dave Barry's work. I never miss a column, and I enjoyed his first novel, Big Trouble. But this second novel was a Big Disappointment. It has too many characters, some of them indistinguishable, some of them cliches. The plot drags. Worst of all, it doesn't offer more than a couple of laughs. The humor seems to be aimed at 14-year-olds. So does the stomach-twisting violence. And how many vomit scenes do we really need?Read something else of Barry's; don't bother with this."
3,I thought I was missing something when prototyping-I wasn't.,"3 Stars == NeutralityIf you are looking for a book on conducting quick usability testing with potential users without touching a computer, this book is for you.If you are looking for special techniques that you think you're missing when it comes to modelling on paper, then look elsewhere. You would do just as well to read the remainer of this review.A summary: Draw a complete interface, including buttons, menus, and other interface elements on a bunch of sheets of paper -- one piece for every window, dialog, or behavior. Don't use a ruler. Hold the pieces of paper in front of a potential user. Have them attempt to perform tasks relevant to your system without how-to assistance. After a few users, you'll have a good idea of what's utterly unusable."
2,Chain Puller,"This book chronicals the life of a guy who grew up discontented, maybe even neglected by his parents, or at least his father, was always rebellious and eventually joined the Hells Angels. It seems from the earliest age he was struggling to prove himself, which he continues to do in this book. He succeeds in pulling his own chain, primarily, focusing on how tough he is and how little he cares about conforming to society's expectations--to the point that he becomes unlikeable. On the upside, I didn't quit reading it--interesting enough to lead me to the end. Then I through it away. I didn't care to keep it on my bookshelf. As I write this, there are more used ones for sale here than there are reviews. Not a good sign."
4,Surprisingly Good,The book is about the life and times of biker / bodyguard / actor Chuck Zito. Its well written and gives details about some of the more (im)famous moments of the Hell's ANgels motorcycle gangs recent past.Zito comes across as more intelligent and elloquent than I expected.
4,street justice,"This was a very quick read for me. I was done in a couple hours. Anybody curious about Chuck Zito or interested in the Hells Angels should read it. There's a fair amount of chest pounding, but a lot of reality, too."
4,he beat up jean claude van damm he cant be a bad guy !,"I read this book in a period of about 4 days it was very interesting to say the least. The book of course starts from when he was a kid going all the way through adulthood to his role on oz and the jobs he has had between bodyguard, bouncer. I know there was a ghost writer but i think the thing that kept it from a 5 star book for me was the constant park the car, get off the bike and punch somebodys lights out and keep going we all know that he and the angels are all tough guys no need to keep putting it in peoples faces through the whole book but I enjoyed reading it."
1,Disapointing,"The Book summary on the back cover calls Chuck Zito a dying breed. Well, if that is the case, respectfuly, I say let that breed die. If you want to here about how tough Chuck Zito is and what a wonderful organization the Hells angels is, than this is the book for you. Chuck basicaly braggs about his encounters with celebreties and glorifies and justifies physical assualts on others. He also reveals that he has a distorted sense of justice. I was hoping to find something substancial and edifying in this book, but was I was greatly disapointed. Although, the book reveals Chucks determination when facing adversity (a admirable quality) and you may be interested in hearing about certain details regarding his encounters with celebraties, his arogance and warped sense of justice arouse disgust."
1,ABSOLUTE RUBBISH!!! 0 STARS FOR THIS WANNABE TOUGH GUY LOSER,"This is a book about a criminal who should still be in jail. Actually i think he should be shot,hanged or put down-along with his fellow biker filth. The book is nothing but rubbish. Zito is not a tough guy-seen the tyson/lewis press conference. Yep zito was there but when the blows were exchanged he was too scared to go in. This man is a lying sack of sh$t. Dont buy his book-boycott it."
1,did not receive,"i am still waiting for the book. over 4 months . i still want the book.it was supposed to be new and hardcover, please send me my book. i paid for it and want it.bobby belfiore179 may placemassapequa park,n.y. 11762i am an old customer and i'm sure its just a mix up , but i want the book now"
3,What did you expect?,"Read the title, look at the cover, what do you expect but a fanciful bunch of stories told by a guy who would rather spend time with ning nongs than his own wife and offspring. Yet it is entertaining and worth a read if your interested. I suggest if you want to learn about the Hells Angels get something that is closer to the truth, Chuck states in this book that the ""gang"" wasnt selling drugs and that it was only certain indivuals, if you have any sort of passing interest in this gang you will likely know the truth regarding the Hells Angels and drug distribution from the 60's on, Chuck Zito must think we are all idiots."
1,Garbage,This book is about an overgrown child who alienates his wife and child to be more loyal to a bunch of even more over grown children. I thought it would be interesting to read about a different sub-culture but the entire book is about fighting...which is pretty much what i thought it would be like.Sometimes there's honor in fighting but when i realized his attitude is way overblown and he was ready to get in anyone's face for looking at him wrong I put this book in the garbage where it belongs. This book represents alot of what's wrong with society today.
3,Interesting Phenomenon,"To be clear, I have not read this book. I would only like to comment on the book as emblematic of an interesting phenomenon: that one of the main symptoms of chronic illness is the desire to talk about it to anyone who will listen. The sufferer may rationalize this urge by saying that it is an attempt to reach out for help. But what is interesting is that usually the sufferer is most long-winded about his illness to people he deems unlikely of providing any direct assistance."
1,No Good..,"It looks good, but the quality was no good!!! The ends were falling off, and I do not recommend this product."
1,Better read the Book,"I had to re-read the book,the movie does'nt have any part of the book in the film.Anyone who has read the book will be very dissapointed with theDVD.The only thing I can think is that maybe there were 2 version's of this film, one for The USA and one for foreign countries. If you are a fanof Chester Himes I suggest you read his works"
5,a great relationship book,I thought this book was insightful and funny. A great reminder not to take things too seriously and to enjoy relationships! A great book to read with your girlfriends! I've already bought copies for Christmas gifts for my best friends who definately need to see that certain myths are MYTHS!!! Enjoy!
2,A detailed account,"This book does what it says--gives a blow by blow description of a trip in a camper and should prove useful to anyone planning such a trip. For an armchair traveler, the book could be substantially improved by a professional editor. In addition, the authors' lack of Spanish fluency seems to have resulted in a shallowness that prevented a deeper understanding of the people and situations they encountered. The authors ate in their camper which also may have prevented insights gained through the usual conversations over food and drink with locals. They did identify what they found to be the most reliable map."
3,Not a Travel Guide,"There isn't much of anything out there that covers this space, so I give it a grudging 3 stars. It's good to know that a retired couple can make this trip, with dog, happily.If your looking for ""travel writing"" that offers a literary adventure and shows the feel and texture of the experience, that's too much to ask of this book.If your looking for the standard travel guide that provides insights and cultural information, that too is in short supply; the only research that appears to have gone in to this is the author's trip itself.All of that said, buy it if you want to make this trip! You'll find idiosyncratic info on routes, farmers markets, how to approach finding a free beach to park on, etc. You'll experience their trip, unfiltered, and learn exactly what they learned.Nicely printed and bound on heavy paper."
3,The Raven and the Rose,This was the first book I read and it was pretty good but I hated the ending (or at least what comes just before) and I probably wouldn't recommend this book to my friends for that reason. Luckily I bought another book by this author or I may not have read anything else after this one.
2,A Thorn among the Roses,"I am a big fan of Virginia Henley so I was very disappointed in this book. I had to force myself to finish reading it. The characters are not likeable at all especially the heroine. And how can a book be good if you can't even find something likable about the characters. Rose is a spoiled, headstrong brat and not much more can be said about her. This really was not a very good effort. If you have not read any Virginia Henley books I suggest reading a different one. If this had been my first I am sorry to say it may have been the last and that would have been a shame as she has written several others that I like and have kept for my own personal library. This story will not be one that I keep!"
2,No plot or character development,"The inital plot sounded as if it had promise but failed to deliver. V.H. rushed through the novel. The heroine's reactions are unreal and childlike. For example, someone reveals a huge, life-shattering secret to her and a moment later she just shrugs it off and forgives everyone! What? This novel would have been better is V.H. had drawn out certain parts in the beginning so the impact of their role in the story would hold more power. Also, she tries too hard to rephrase romantic or erotic language into the time period. I have never heard of male genitals being referred to as ""long manroot"". What is he a tree? All in all, the characters aren't well develop and neither is the premise of the story. If you really want this book find it for free....thats all its worth."
3,Fequiere 1,"I was a little dissappointed because she left some loose ends, for instance why did she not let the the kings brother Clarence get his for forcing himself on Roseanna and what ever happen to Linclon her second husband. I like her other books better. In those books at least the finished with each storyline."
2,Not one of Virginia Henley's best!,After reading A Year and a Day (the only other V.H. book I've read) I was very disapointed at this book.
5,Very touching love story,Not only was this an excellant book but so are the rest of her books. Well done!!!!!!

5,A Great Zoo Just Got Better,"The Marine Mania expansion pack of Zoo Tycoon is great. While adding marine wildlife and shows to your zoo increases the level of challenge, I have personally enjoyed Marine Mania more in the past week that the past several months of Dinosaur Digs. But don't get me wrong, I still want my Dinosaurs.The increase in features such as new marine animals, tanks instead of exhibits, new buildings for making $$$ and very decorative foliage all add a whole new look to any zoo, making a great zoo even better."
4,Zoo Tycoon et al.....,"I love Zoo Tycoon (not Dino Digs so much) and I'm sure Marina Mania will be awesome - judging by webshots and the buzz at various fansites. I can't wait to incorporate ""3D"" water into exhibits. But I do have a word of warning for those who are not familiar with the Zoo Tycoon games. This game is not for people who like fast-paced action games. No explosions or monsters to kill, - no gore (unless an amimal escapes, or you let one loose). So this might bore some to tears. But, that being said, it's still a great game. It's very challenging trying to keep animals and visitors happy and have a cool looking zoo. If you ever wanted to be a zoo keeper when you were a kid, you NEED this game!"
1,BEWARE! Does not work with Zoo Tycoon 2 for Mac!,"My daughter really wanted the Marine Mania expansion pack, so I searched the internet until I found it at Amazon. All the details appeared to indicate that this product worked with Zoo Tycoon 2. However, it only works for Zoo Tycoon 2 for Windows, NOT for Macintosh. Therefore, I now own software that I cannot use, as we have Zoo Tycoon 2 for Mac. If you are a Mac owner, make sure that you do not get caught making this mistake."
3,Not really for kids?,I bought this game for my 2 kids age 6 and 8. The game is a little bit too complicated for them. I had to sit down and try and learn it to allow them to play. The game ran way too slow for my patience and required a lot of learning. I would only recommend it for older kids or adults who have alot of time to invest and already have a pretty powerful computer system.
5,"Great, Great, Great!","This is a great add-on to the Zoo Tycoon series. The animals and the buildings are really slick and can add a lot to your zoo. However, I can't think of anything else they can do for this series to keep it running...."
2,I am MAD,"I bought this game from a guy and when i got it, it said i had to have the original game. I am going to sell it.Do not buy this game if you have the original game."
5,Can't Wait 'til it comes out!,"About 2 months ago, I got the original zoo tycoon, and dino digs. My friend(who also has the games) told me about downloads for them on the internet. So, i began searching for some until I came to one site. I saw the words 'marine mania,' so I read a few sentences about this. I thought it looked pretty cool, but wasn't really thinking because I was tire. A few weeks leter, I was with my friend and we were looking for downloads at her house. We came to the same site I had been on and I saw something new there. There were about 5 screenshots, and we were in awe when we saw them! We looked at the dolphins, and all we could saw was ""Awwwww!"" Ever since then, we have been waiting and counting the days! We both plan to buy it on the 17th! This game looks awesome! The graphics are great, and so are the new features! I saved every screenshot I found for it, and use them as my desktop background! I can't wait!"
1,Whats the point?,"This game is one of the worst tycoon games I have ever played, and most of them are terrible to begin with. What is the point in adding on to an already terrible game?!"
5,Two-To-Three,"I'm not sure where they get off on the ""two-to-three-people"" thing, but I'll tell you now that unless you're sleeping with leprechauns, this is not true. It could possibly fit two of you, but it depends how big of an individual you and your tent partner are.Overall, I love the tent because it does the job and does it well. It's light, easy to set up (took me maybe five minutes, though I am an ex-boy scout), and fits in a relatively small bag. I currently have it in a compression bag with my atlas and road maps fastened under my Alice Pack."
5,much fun,My sons have so much fun wiht Thomas the train that adding Rolf's Castle Bridge keeps the playing for hours on end. The values that Thomas the train teaches my sons are great and they use them in every day life so thank you very much.
3,Flimsy,"These are made of a thin one-sided terrycloth. Don't seem to fit a standard jump seat very well. I have them one their, barely. They would be better if they were more like the material boat covers are made from. Keep looking... :)"
4,Very Cute!,"This little guy is just cute! The dispenser seems to work well with 3"" chlorine tabs. I do not think that the product will last more than a season or two at best but these things never do. Also, I have noticed a slight build up of chlorine residue that gathers in the thread pattern and causes difficulty in getting the top to go on straight. A little cleaning and the problem is solved. All in all a fairly inexpensive way to bring some fun to your pool."
3,Quality Issue,The tablet canister that screws onto the bottom of the alligators head does not thread properly. The threads on the bottom of the alligators head are injection molded with the head so the tablet canister slips over half of the threads and then bites onto the last thread or two. It was inexpensive and is working for now so I don't plan to spend the time to return it. Otherwise the product works fine.
2,missing part,I love the way the product looks but I thought it was supposed to come with the cholorine dispenser and all I got was the alligator
4,Bad paint,"Functionally, this product is fine. The only problem I have had is that after about a week, the paint started coming off of the frog that sits on the alligator's head."
1,Chlorine Tablet Dispenser,"I had to return this. The body of the allegator had a hole in it and it sank to the bottom of the pool. Also, because of its horizontal length, it interfered with the automatic vacuum sweeper's air line."
3,Good Reference Book,"This book is great to give you some general guidlines, obedience, and information on raising your puppy. The information is good and useful, however as you begin raising your puppy and you need more information you will end up having to buy some other books that are more specific. For example this book does give some good obedience instructions with great picture demonstrations. However it does not go into great detail about each command so if you have trouble or this method doesn't work for you, you will most likely have to buy another book that is specifically written on obedience. I highly suggest ""Rover, Dont Roll Over"". This books has great illustration though and if you need the extra pictures as an example of how to do something then definitly purchase this book as a nice reference guide."
2,the key physics is largely buried under the heavy notations and equations,"if you don't have enough energy to bite through from the beginning, stay away from this book. The key physics is largely buried under the (unnecessarily) heavy notations and equations.However, it may be a good source for reference."
1,somewhat disappointing second edition,"This book used to be really modern and avant garde in its first edition, but the second edition somehow doesn't make upwith the first one. There are quite a few misprints and it looks as if the concise style of the first edition had been abandonned for a more talkative, but confusing style. Also, J. Wiley really overmarket their products in recent times. The jacket of the book is just full of rubish publicity about the merits of the book. ......"
5,Trombone needs oil,My son ran out of oil for his trombone 2 weeks prior to me ordering it from you. I found the oil for an unbeatable price and bought two bottles. It arrived in a timely manner and has helped with his sticking problems.
2,Disappointing,This CD includes a selection of 12 songs from 12 musicals (listed above) produced on Broadway between 1935 and 1946. There are no liner notes included to provide an overview of the period.
2,Disappointed,"From the description/picture I expected more. I knew the diamonds were not great quality, but the settings do not look too great. Also, it is VERY light, in fact it somehow has already bent a little so it is now a little distorted. The measruement and diamond quality was accurate, it just does not look as ""nice"" as the picture. However, delivery time was speedy."
5,FamilyLife does it again! :),This is a wonderful resource! It's a creative way to tell the Christmas story and the figures are very nice - not cheap looking. It's very easy to use and great for the whole family!
1,Are you kidding me?,One wise person. Open baby Jesus before Christmas. Giving God presents for Christmas?!!!? Presents shouldn't be the focus of Christmas! Get a regular nativity and a Bible and tell the story yourself. You don't need this hoaky product to have meaningful Christmas.
4,What a fun read.,"This past week end was the perfect time to read this novel, the Pebble Beach Pro/Am was taking place for real. This book is a quick read and I'm only sorry there will not be a sequel. Now I will never know if Shane tells the truth and if he gets the girl.Perfect gift for golfers or mystery fans or a combination of both."
1,Paint it any color and call it every bull out their.,"Anyone that can smell this bull. Little Yellow Jackets left horn is turned down, not up or even with the other. Hes a one of a kind."
1,I've learned more on the wall of a bathroom stall than I did with this garbage!,"This book contains no information that can't easily be found with a quick google search. I have no idea who let this dunce write a book. I purchased this book with the hope of gaining new insight, however after getting half way through the book, I realized that a physically handicapped hamster could have written something more insightful. I can believe I wasted $1.50 plus shipping on this tripe! WHAT A JOKE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!"
2,A list of spells ranging in the same topic,"Ok, we all want written spells, right? Ok! But what you get from this book is nothing more than about ten spells using the same principles, so if you don't like the first of the spell (personally, I thought the book was going to be more useful), you can throw the entire book away, cause they're always like each other. As the subject can easily increases (cause different ways of writing the spells wields different results) I think the book could be more diverse, what surely don't. I read the book in less than an hour, and really, I just liked one spell. Wasn't worth my money - or my time."
3,a little trippy,"I purchased this for my 4 year old as an alternative to all of the big budget/toy tie-in movies. The DVD was well made and has beautiful, rich colored art work. The songs are sweet and catchy. My daughter enjoyed it but it didn't keep her interest. She hasn't asked for it again and I was a little put off by some of the subject matter in some of the songs - death mentioned, etc. I like to think of myself as progressive and admit that some themes do go over my kid's head but this was just getting to the line I prefer not to cross. I gave an extra star for creativity and for not having a purple dinosaur."
4,The hidden glory of India,"Product was just as I had hoped. The book was in good condition at the right price. I received the book, not waiting too long. Thanks. Bruce M."
2,well?,"I was very excited for this to come in the mail, and then it did ,and I opened up a big bag of let down ""sorry to the makers"".it just looked very cheap (understanding the price) i get it, however, the boast from the makers and buyers isn't entirely true ..This looks as something my grandma Thelma might wear ""respectfully"" love you grandma."
2,Out of Stock!,"This looks like it would be a very nice ring, at least that's what other customers say about it, but I wouldn't know personally because I placed my order and received an email the next day saying the item was out of stock, even though Amazon's website says the item is in stock (and still says it's in stock today). I emailed the supplier and asked how long it would be before it was in stock again and they replied it would take 45 days (from Feb 20). But amazon still says it's in stock. Place your order if you want but the size 10 I ordered won't be available until sometime around the end of March or beginning of April."
2,Those who know the basics of writing will find this useless,"I am a professional business writer and editor, and I decided to purchase this book to gain a fresh look at what I do for a living. What I found was a slim book filled with tired old words of advice. If you have any writing background, this book will be of little use to you. However, I can see that it could be of use to people who don't have a grasp of the basics. Those people would probably be better served by a more intensive reference book, though."
2,A lot of info missing from this map...,"What's missing (this map was dated 2004):*Rongai route is not labeled.*Lemosho route is not even on the map.*Many camping areas are not labeled or are missing from the map altogether (for example; Fischer, Sheffield, Crater, Forest, Millennium, etc.).*Some trails shown do not lined up correctly with reference points they are known to pass through (for example; the trail from Kibo Hut to Gilman's Point doesn't pass through Gilman's point on the map).*Weird mix of elevation reference points and color coding done in 'meters' while adding 100 'foot' contour lines.*Misinformation about the routes coming from the north (Rongai/Loitokitok) as being dangerous and closed when in fact that are open and safe. Years ago they were dangerous but the situation was resolve some time ago.*A blurb on the side of the map pushes the Marangu route as the best but its really the worst because of the sheer numbers of people."
1,The worst science book that I have read recently,"The book coveres big topics, e.g., free energy (Chapter 19) and nuclear fusion (Chapter 20). The author, however, did not even get simple facts correct. W (watt) is incorrectly identified as ""Tungsten"" on p.623 and 625. JET is said to be ""Joint European Toms"" (p.626). It should be ""Torus"" instead of ""Toms"". I wonder how many Toms are there in Europe under this scheme. It is a waste of tree to print this book."
3,The World's 20 Greatest Unsolved Problems,"20 Greatest Unsolved Problems covers the fields of Astronomy and Cosmology, Physics and Astrophics, Biology and Paleontology, Neuroscience, Geology, Chemestry, and Energy.It should be required reading for anyone interested in acquiring a better understanding of the current ideas of science as a whole.The price was right as shipping was far more than used market price and in almost pristine condition."
5,Wide Range of Topics/Wide range of explanations,I really enjoyed reading this book. I am not very proficient in some of the areas covered. I thought the book did a great job of explaining the topics and then giving me some of the explanations that are possible and then finally coming to a conclusion. The book will definitely make you think and understand how little human beings really know about the universe they reside in. I feel after reading this book I know what questions should be asked and I now I have a better grasp of some of the world's greatest mysteries.
4,One of the better looking !!,"This game shows some brilliant visuals just because of its advancement in graphics technology, but its somewhat shameful that it couldn`t deliver graphics that could beat the less advanced Playstation2.The smoke and dust effects aren`t upto mark, not even equal to Ps2`s Gran Turismo 3 which isn`t at all a full pledged Rally game.I give it 4 stars because of the vertex and pixel shading utilisation to a large extent."
2,Ultimately disappointing,"This console (X-Box) port results in slick graphics, annoying music and unrealistic physics. The intensity, the hair-raising stress of on-the-edge racing is completely missing. If you think this is a 5 star racing sim, you should get out more often!"
1,P.O.S.,"Unable to run on either my desktop (XP) or my Vista laptop.Locks up my laptop and either locks up or blue screens my desktop on which I can run anything from crysis to the latest iteration of Microsoft flight Sim with everything on high and all available periphials.Yoke and wheelrudder pedals,four throttle,etc.Wound up shredding the disc.That'll teach it not to mess with me boy.If it was possible I would have given it no stars. ..!."
5,Does he ever make a bad album?,"Glen Velez never ceases to amaze me. He uses rhythms and instruments from all over the world, but his music never conflicts with itself. Many times he seems right on the edge of collapsing into percussive noisemaking, but with his unequaled sense of harmony, and melody, he never fails to make the most original music today."
2,not even unintentionally hilarious,"Maybe I'd have liked this book better if I'd read the others in the series (though I don't know if I could stomach two more volumes worth of this). But seriously ... an annoying heroine, a boring hero and interludes that are described with phrases like ""woman heat"" and ""male part""? Sigh ... I may be willing to read just about anything, but I found it hard to make myself finish this. Still, two stars for good historical research."
3,Not the Best,"This book was not the best in the series. Of course, I started at the end with the Blue Viking, but still, the story trudged along and I did not care for either character. Try another one."
5,"Another great read from Sandra, very funny & very hot indead","I cannot think about Sandra's books without having a smile on my face. And when I read them, which I have done loads of times I am in stitches. Eirik and Eadyth are another of Sandra's perfectly matched couples. They will have in tears of laughter with their antics. Especially when you read about Eirik standing on his head.Thank you Sandra for giving us another marvelous story in your Viking series. I love them all."
5,TOTAL AND COMPLETE ROMANCE AT ITS BEST!!,Lady Eadyth proposes marriage to Eirik of Ravenshire and the ride never ends. This book is the most. I could not wait to get back to find out what would happen next. Extremely funny in parts so much so that you laugh out loud and your husband will wonder what your reading. Edge of your seat page turner. The physical and emotional and sexual attraction once they recognize it is extremely powerful. She is a strong woman used to running her own life and hates having to depend on a man to protect her son from evil. Eirik plays an equally strong man who underestimates the power of love. Surprise ending too. Definitely a keeper.
2,Use: for either the Telephoto adapter lens or wide angle..,Don't buy this or the Telephoto lens which attaches (Olympus TCON-17F 1.7x Tele Conversion Lens for Olympus SP-310/350 Digital Cameras)... you will be wasting your $$ on something that has very little affect overall on the enhanced telephoto abilities of a casual use camera.
5,Great family game for all ages,"We love this game particularly because it is suitable for many ages. We have children ages 4,7, and 10 and it is very hard to find games that we can all play together as a family, and have everyone really be able to participate fully, especially the 4 year old. This game was perfect! We all had great laughs watching each other act out the names of the characters and our little one was thrilled that she was getting a lot more of the answers right than mom and dad even were for once! haha This is great family fun, and I would love to see them come out with additional card sets to go along with the game, especially the easier young children cards."
4,Fun,"This is a very fun game. I got it for Christmas. This has anything and everything about the Disney characters. If you think you know disney, try this game!This comes in a tin, so it is very durable. It has recieved banging around from trying to put the lid on the box, and yet the box is not crushed.This toy really isn't educational, unless you call answering questions of Disney and learning to do wacky actions is educational.There could have been a longer board, but over all, Mattel did a good job."
5,A Good Guide to the new Features in Java 1.4,I found this book to be a good tutorial when upgrading to Java 1.4. Afterwards it was also useful as a reference book.The book clearly explains the new concepts and features in Java 1.4 and has many examples. It doesn't waste time explaining how to program in Java instead sticking to the new features. It is good to have a book that focuses mainly on new features instead of being filled up with information that is already known.It is a good book for finding out the new features of Java 1.4.
3,JDK 1.4 Tutorial,Don't judge a book by it's title. I had hoped that the book would be a good primer on not only the newest version of Java but of Java itself. As a novice I was disappointed. It did provide some nice insights into where Java wanted to go and how the changes would get it there. But I had hoped for more. When I get more experience with programming I look forward to coming back to this book and more fully appreciating what it offers.
4,A lyrical and beautiful short,Gorgeous and lush photography combine with great settings and great acting. This is a beautiful short film that takes advantage of its Santa Barbara setting and a complex but romantic script.
1,The worst,Neither intuitive nor user friendly. Microsoft has lost me as a customer forever. The product is a bad dream. Competely dysfunctional. I paid good money for a product that requires me to completely relearn software that was functional.
2,For Now It's A Nuisance,"Far from user-friendly, you will be at the office later at night tearing out your hair trying to find the buttons on the tool bar for even the simplest of office tasks, wondering ""Why did I get this program again?"" Its like reading another language after using previous editions of Word, which I was a big fan of. I guess with some extensive getting used to the it might be nice but for now it's a nuisance. I can't find anything on this toold bar that looks like an airplane cockpit. In the words of Thoreau ""Simplify.""Good luck sending files as attachments to colleagues-they won't be able to view the newere version. Get used to saving in ""97-2003 Word Format."" Also, won't comply with other programs such as e-fax unless saved in this manner. At this price, you could do without the headache."
1,Gigantic problem with this product--beware!,"I purchased Office 2007 Premium to upgrade my existing Office 2003 installation. Installation went fine, and I worked with the product for a few weeks. Then I wanted to use some templates--and found out that even though I spent a lot of money to purchase this product, IT DOES NOT COME WITH TEMPLATES! You have to download them from MS Office online.When I tried to download the templates (resumes, brochures, etc.) the website finds my old 2003 installation and rejects the newer version, claiming that my product key is invalid. There is no work-around for this, and I have yet to find a solution. In other words, if you have a previous version of Office, none of the templates or online content are available to you.How Microsoft would let a problem like this get through testing is beyond me. It illustrates the incompetence that has become the norm for this organization (check out the Vista disaster)."
1,"Ok, if you don't know how to use prior versions","I've owned this version for over two years. I am a power user of Office XP and earlier version. This 2007 version made even the simplest task very time consuming (at least an hour). If you have invested many, many hours in developing expertise in the earlier versions - expect to re-invest at least those hundreds of hours. Finally, there is NOT an easy way to transition to this new version. RESIST, DELAY and AVOID moving to this 2007 version. (It is not easy to remove and re-install back to 2003.) The ONLY improved application is Outlook.Whoever developed this for Microsoft should NO LONGER BE THERE and should NEVER be allowed to develop another piece of user software."
1,Lost Productivity,"If you are familiar with prior Office versions and you are a busy person, do not go to Office 2007. You will loose hours and hours of productivity trying to find menu items that you knew right where to find in prior versions. Microsoft decided that they know what a user wants when it comes to using their products. So instead of giving you the choice of using the older Office menus, Microsoft does not give you a choice so that they can force you into the new menu system. Read the rest of the reviews and ask yourself, does Microsoft really care what the users want when they could have easily provided users a choice of menu systems?"
2,BUYER BEWARE THIS SOFTWARE IS SLOW!,"I have used Microsoft dating back to first DOS program. I own two companies with about 50 plus computers between them. So I am the guinea pig on all new software.I have an extremely fast computer, with 4 gig of ram, terabyte of 4 fast hard drives on XP pro. I have built many computers. I only share this with you so you will see I am no novice.I cannot stress enough how slow my system is now when Outlook is on. Do a Google search with ""Outlook 2007 slow"" and you will see what I mean. I also agree with others about the so called ribbon approach. This all reminds me of when BMW introduce their infamous idrive. Al their tech people thought it was revolutionary.What really happened was catastrophic to BMW. I was present when a customer came in the show room demanded their old BMW back or they would sue.You need to wait until they get this fixed and I recommend you make sure it is fixed. I cannot believe they released such a dog program."
1,I need to rant,"Honestly, this version of office has infuriated me beyond belief. I actually want to do harm to the Microsoft idiots responsible for the UI design. I have always supported Microsoft's UI design. The old consistent window menus are gone, and now you got something called a ribbon. You'll jump through hoops trying to adjust the stupid thing.It takes me longer to do a simple task before I found out where they hid a command. Bottom line, navigation is completely different. Was this supposed to be easier to use? It seems everything I need to do take a couple more steps.The operating system gets mangled (Vista) and now Office. I have never been this annoyed about a software product from Microsoft. The last software that annoyed me this much was Photoshop, which I felt didn't support the shot-gun approach."
2,No so good,After close to a year of using this product I still find it frustrating and inferior to past versions. For the most part I don't like the menu structures.
2,Think twice about Word...,"After several weeks using Word 2007 regularly, I haven't found any new functionality for memos, technical documents, or anything I do regularly. Microsoft promotes their ""fluent"" interface for graphics design, but if you aren't craving graphic design capabilities, you'll probably be disappointed. The icons and command interfaces are quite different and, to me at least, not very intuitive. I see no real added benefit to compensate for the lost productivity of re-learning how to do everything I took for granted in version 2003. Outlining and Track Changes features are especially disappointing; at best counter-intuitive, at worst, downright glitchy.Excel has not been a disappointment. The sorting and Autofilter features are much more flexible and easier to use."
3,Necessary Evil,"As the title says, sometimes you need to have Office. For instance, you deal with a person or company that sends you Word 2007 formatted documents that need to be edited and returned. Otherwise I'd just use OpenOffice."
4,Had a little kink with the installation but the MS people helped me a great deal,"The product is exactly what I wanted. MS Office is basic for business these days. Getting used to it is hard at the beginning, if you have had other Office versions, and with the new layout certain things are more difficult to find, because I was used to the old menus. However once that realization came to mind I understood the logic of the new layout and overall is great.I Had apparently received the wrong CD in the package but Microsoft Customer Service helped me a great deal and we got it resolved, it took a little longer than I would have liked but they ultimately resolved the issue."
1,MS Office 2007 - falsely represented,"This product is listed and pictured as the Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version packaged product.It is not.The item is a duplicated CD. The only identification is the serial number/product key which is printed on a white mailing label and placed on the unmarked CD.It is enclosed in a clear, plastic unmarked DVD case.The duplicated CD does contain Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version. The product key/serial number does work.This item is not a sealed Microsoft-labeled box or product CD nor is there any written material with it.It is mailed in a bubble-wrap DVD mailing envelop.This item is not the pictured item (which it is associated with) on the Amazon.com site.This is false representation."
1,No Merchandise,Cannot review merchandise because the seller took my money and never sent me the item. Had to file for a refund.I need Office 2007 for my work. I will purchase it elsewhere. I know it can be tricky to use.
4,Takes getting used to,"I like the 2007 version but seeing how the last time I upgraded was to 2000, there were some huge differences in some areas but nothing that one can't figure out. I'm still checking it out but so far so good... I wish I could say the same for Vista."
1,Defected Package,I Received defected package twice and unable to instal the Microsoft office 2007.Pari
1,Pokemon Computers,"Just want to state the product was never shipped and supplier did not answer my e-mails, and neither did Amazon.com, despite three phone calls to them. I rate both of them the pits! I bought the product again from E-Bay."
1,Poor Service,"After 3 weeks I had still not reicived my item. No contact by the seller. I contacted the company and got a poor us story. ""your item is held up on the boarder"" But... ""I just so happen to have one here in my office that I will express ship to you..."" Two weeks later my item arrived."
4,"Pricey, but some good stuff","I am a college student and I bought Office Student/Teacher 2003 a year and a half ago and so I used the trial for Office 2007. I found out all that I was missing by not getting the Professional version. I got the software for $199 (thank goodness for Academic pricing) and I feel it's worth it. The only reason I give this software 4 stars is because you can only put it on one computer and if you have multiple computers, you have to buy another copy (the main reason I liked Student/Teacher versions--you have 3 computers you can install software on) and the price. But, if you find out you need programs like Publisher and Access, it's worth every penny!"
1,"Not the FULL version, this turned out to be the Academic Version","I was very disappointed to find that the vendor sold me the Academic Version of this software under the guise of the FULL version.The vendor agreed to a partial refund, but to this date has not issued any refund.I'm not happy with this transaction."
5,First impressions of the new MS Word,"Well, I disagree with the others here. I haven't done that much with it, but I really like the way the new Word works. Instead of a drop-down menu when you click on something like ""insert,"" you get the whole bar (now called a ribbon) replaced.I use tables a lot and I like all the features that are sitting right in sight on this new version."
5,Microsoft Office,Received my merchandise on day requested and I am very happy with product. Will recommend product and seller.
1,have not received a working product,I received a product that was for setting up a new computer and asked the seller if this was the correct product before opening it. They said yes and to open it. I attempted to install it and it says there is a corrupt file or missing file on the installation disk. I emailed the seller and they said they would send a replacement disk immediately. I have never received it to date. I sent an email last week saying I had still not received the product and have not received a reply.
1,Learning Curve provides opportunty to get off of Office Bandwagon,"The major investment individuals put in software is not the $ amounts to purchase, but the hours ,weeks, & years of time it takes to learn how to master the product. I have spent years working with Excel , Access, Word, and PowerPoint. O-2007's new interface put me back to--if not day 1, week 1. I will have a lot to learn to approach the level of competence I have with O-2003. The new Ribbons seem a lot less flexible then the Icons & Menus. I am not happy with this product.Seems to me like it is a good time to see what alternatives are out there."
1,Echoing other complaints,"I've used MS Word since the mid-90s, and this is like a slap in the face from Microsoft. I can't imagine they tested this with anyone not involved in its development. Everything one needs and has learned to access in earlier versions has been spread to hell and back. It does auto-formatting contortions a python would be proud of. I had to set up a task bar with all the old icons...heck, I can't even describe the struggles I'm having. I got this suite on the cheap (educator's discount), and am going back to using Open Office, which I had installed on my new machine to tide me over till I got MS Office. Microsoft, for God's sake, stop changing stuff simply for the sake of change, and before you foist another such abomination on the public, take a few users of old versions and have them give it a run...and I mean average users--the kind who don't need or want every damn cutesy thing you can come up with."
1,Performance sucks! Not worth the money!,I installed Office 2007 Professional right after it came out. Unfortunately the overall performance sucks. Outlook is almost unusable. Most actions take three times as long as they used to take in Outlook 2003. The interface is radically different and takes forever to get used to. I recommend to stick with Office 2003 or to get OpenOffice.
2,Not worth the price tag,"I purchased this product thinking that the new features would be well worth the money. I was wrong, this is a buggy product that has a 50/50 chance of correctly opening my old 2003 documents using (compatibility mode).How could Microsoft overlook this?I have over 500 documents in office 2003 and now I have to click and HOPE that they transfer over correctly.Also this program has a hard time translating products from different programs like movie magic, exports from old contact lists, and pretty much everything that I've tried.The only reason I gave it two stars is because the user interface is 'pretty' giving the program a clean look, but to put it simply I didn't buy this program for its looks.For the price tag Microsoft needs to make a program that is FULLY backwards compatible and communicates with other programs properly."
1,Worst Software Package that I've ever bought.,"I upgraded my office 2003 with the new Office 2007 just a couple of months ago. I've been a Microsoft fan for a long time but needless to say, I've never been as disappointed with any software upgrade as I was with this one. Everything takes at least 3 times as long, it takes forever to get used to, and simple commands such as ""word count"" take forever to find. I've been happy with Microsoft software updates up to this date, but I'm amazed that a company such as this would alienate its customer base this way!!..If you're thinking about buying this package...I strongly recommend you to find something else!!!"
1,Makes me feel like I've never used a computer before,"I've been using, or rather, attempting to use, Office 2007 for several weeks now. Only every time I want to edit my document, make a formatting change, etc. - things I could do in a second in Office 2003 - I invariably end up searching the ribbon in vain and turning to the help document. Good luck finding that, incidentally, it must've taken me five minutes the first time. Seriously, ""steep learning curve"" is an understatement - Microsoft has absolutely trashed Office's interface."
4,Buy the upgrade version if...,"If you have any (check on requirements) Microsoft Office stuff installed on your PC (or get some), buy the Office 2007 PRO Upgrade version for less, and get Office 2010 Pro Download free. 2007 must be installed by some time before or in October, and 2010 must be downloaded by then, also."
3,Microsoft Office,"The programs are nice but the default view of them looks too ""fluffy"" I prefer the Classic Microsoft look over this. Also, my old Word program used to print the address barcodes on my envelopes. The new Microsoft in order to regain this feature you have to pay for a 3rd party postage program."
1,Microsoft blew it,"The menus in these programs are completely unusable. Microsoft won't admit they blew it, but instead want us all to believe the menus are ""more intuitive"". BS. I've been researching the issue, and evidently a company has software that makes the menus in Office 2007 look like Office 2003. ThinK i may get it. [...]"
2,Beware of Office 2007 Professional,"I'm running under XP SP2, which Office 2007 says is acceptable. However, when I tried to run OUTLOOK 2007, it hung. I had to drop back to OUTLOOK 2002. The remaining applications run fine."
1,Never received,The person I ordered this product from never sent it out. I sent an email questioning when I should expect it and was never responded to. Distributor065 should not be allowed to have an account if they are not going to comply with the agreement.
1,Supper bad seller!,"Never received item. Contacted seller by email. Seller did not reply.Shipping for the intem was Aprio 11 - 14, 2008. Then change to April 17 - May 2, 2008. I would not buy from this seller."
1,Office 2007,"I did not get an opportunity to use this product, as the seller sent me an OEM version, clearly marked ""only to be sold with a new PC"". This was a violation of the EULA, and Minnesota law."
1,Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version,"I was very disappointed with the product and service from Brainstorm Co. I ordered a new copy of the software and when received it did not appear to be new at all. More importantly, the software was not able to be downloaded into a computer after several attempts.I also did not get an acceptable response for return of software to Brainstorm Co. I did receive an email that said I would receive a return address label the next day but was not ever received after 8 days.I have since filed a claim through Amazon and if that works as planned I will be pleased with AmazonJohn Gabrenas Jr."
1,Never received item,I never received item from seller and having problem with the seller. Thank you.
1,Stay 2003 or Open Office,I posted this on the single Word review but thought it to be important to put here as well.The user interface for Microsoft's Office 2007 is horrible. I had it installed at work thinking I had an upgrade. From the confusing and unintuitive user interface to formulas that don't work there is no way that I can recommend this for business professionals. Stay with 2003 or get Open Office unless you like pretty pictures.
1,A Downgrade,"I almost never write a review for a product online. In this case, I felt obligated.In absolute terms, Office 2007 is an incredibly useful piece of software. But who cares? The relevant point here is that the 2007 suite is a HUGE downgrade from previous versions. The interfaces are much more complicated and less useful, and the .docx extension in Word is problematic. Unless you have a specific reason to purchase this software that you're already aware of, there's no reason to buy this product."
1,User unfriendly,"This is a horrible package. Not at all intuitive; what used to be extremely user friendly menu bars have been turned into something convoluted and difficult. I could breeze through creating really nice and effective presentations in PPT-03; this thing takes minutes to search out how to perform some very basic functions, all of which were painless with 2003. Screen is excessively cluttered with these menu ribbons. I am taking this off of my computer and going back to the older version."
2,Why did I bother?,"One of the most painful experiences I have every had to load. Hours of frustration. Perhaps because I wanted to keep my 2003. Finally did custom install with nearly all features turned off. Boy that was not in the book. I know it takes time to get use to something new, but things that should be right up front have became a game of hunt and peck or research. Some I have just given up on and went back to 2003. Valueless or seldom used features clutter ribbon. The whole layout/ribbon is nothing more than someone's opinion of what works best for them or what MS thought would show the best. Frankly, I think thier opinion stinks. I would rather have had a real user design the ribbons verses Marketing or a MS programmer. Marketing at its finest and I bit."
1,Over Rated Program,I have used Office 2007 for a while now and I had to switch back to office 2003. The program is very buggy at best and a lot of the features are not stabled at all.1st problem in the paragraph section every time you write something it goes to double line. By the time I am finished I have to go back and redo everything again with the settings.The whole program is messed up it also takes up 4 gigs of ram which is a hog.I think I will stick with office 2003 until I am buying a new pc.
2,May not be worth the time and money.,"Office 2007 has some features that are better that 2003, but nothing I couldn't live without. And be prepared to spend a lot of time relearning the programs. Considering the cost in time and money it may not be worth it to change to the new version. For a real bargain download the free office suite from [...]."
1,Office 2007 - versus the older version you already own,"You will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have.Don't expect to turn this version on and be able to use it. Many changes are literally imposed on you, like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars. Missing menus and the auto-double space setting every time you hit return.There are new features which can be helpful to some, but Microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining.The arrogance of Microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible.You upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual."
3,Almost Full,"This may seem a little outdated, however, Cool. There should be manuals that accompany this package as the old versions did. Nobody wants to use $100.00 worth of ink to print out manuals.Otherwise the product is what I expected."
1,Overpriced junk - beware of high grade counterfeits,"Most of the tasks that can be accomplished by Office 2007 are easily accomplished with OpenOffice. However, OpenOffice is free unlike this rip-off that costs almost $500.Also double check your copy is not counterfeit. All office packages I ran into recently were high grade counterfeits. Not sure if a Microsoft Office suite is worth the trouble or money anymore when there's free OpenOffice. Compatibility is getting better too."
4,Rating Microsoft Office Suite,"Other than being far too expensive, as required by Microsoft, the product is exceellent. I use a number of the elements in the suite, and find them easy to navigate. Amazon's service in this transaction was outstanding."
1,Ghastly!,"Got it at the office; been using it for a couple of weeks. Haven't found a single new thing I'll ever use. As for the rest, well... it's all there if you can find it.If you loved going from XP to Vista, this is the ticket for you. I don't get it. Why? Why do they hate us so much?"
3,It's Not All THAT Bad,"I'm not having that much trouble with Microsoft Office Professional 2007, although I will agree with a lot of long-time users out there that it has ""failed-safe""d itself to point of frustration. There is dumbing down, and there is DDx2. Hey, nothing ventured nothing gained. We'll see ...Someone out there suggested that Microsoft should allow alternatives, and that would be a cool thing."
3,"Beware of ""refurbished"" versions","I had difficulty loading the software. Upon calling Microsoft for assistance, I was informed mine was a ""rebuilt"" version and I would need technical help. Received help loads and works fine. Not sure how to verify that before you purchase or if there will be future issues because of it, but buyers should know what their getting."
1,Still waiting for resolution,The seller sent me a defective item and still hasn't come through and made good on a resolution.
1,"Didn't work, no response from vendor, rip-off",Disk would not load - message said 'corrupted'. Vendor never replied. I now see others have had the same issue. I am waiting for my credit card refund. Do not buy from this vendor.
1,MS You Have Ruined Another Program,I simply cannot express my digust with Microsoft for destroying this suite of products. I upgraded to MS Office 2007 and regret wasting the money. How on earth can a corporation like this be so stupid ? All of the menus have changed- nothing is recognizable. In an instant all your experience is gone and you begin from square one. I have worked with this product since it was a DOS based product and am speechless.We should band together and help stop this insanity. Isn't there another product out there that we can go to? This is what happens when you allow a corporation to dominate an area. Let us start over with a company that has a clue. Microsoft you suck !!!
3,the office ribbon is absolutely horrible,"what kind of a company rewards loyal users by putting up a roadblock to productivity? this is the worst software 'upgrade' i have ever seen, and I've been using software for the past 20 years. yes, there are additional useful features. yes, there are fixes to previous limitations. but no, they did not have to be implemented with a completely new UI. The office ribbon is like GM taking the steering wheel and putting it on the other side of the car, and calling that a better car, though indeed, the new car has a better engine. WTF? why would anyone approve this without at least having an option, add-in, or whatever work around to go back to the classic menus? unfortunately this is a business school case worthy example of how not to treat your customers."
2,Look Before You Leap!,"WARNING! Do not assume that installing Office 2007 will make your life easier.If you have been a long-time user of MS Office, and you install Office 2007, you will EXPERIENCE EXTREME FRUSTRATION when trying to use OUTLOOK, EXCEL, WORD and POWERPOINT (I haven't tried the other programs).In order to navigate the programs somewhat effectively, I had to purchase a progam from China to make the use of Office 2007 Pro more familiar.It is inconceivable to me that Microsoft would trash all of the excellent work that has been done on the Office product suite . . . but they have succeeded!I unistalled Office 2007 Pro and have re-installed Office 2003 Pro.I pity those employees who have been ""upgraded"" to Office 2007 by their company.If you insist on trying Office 2007, I wish you the best of luck!"
2,Yet Another Microsoft Improvement!,"As another reviewer mentioned, I really like Microsoft products, but the latest version of Office is just not very productive. In the previous version I could access what I needed through simple menu selections. But now I have to go through some really goofy tabs. And quite frankly, the tabs are probably okay, except, why can't I have the choice between the Office 2003 menus and Office 2007 tabs? I mean, really, Microsoft gives us the new and imporved Windows, but then doesn't gives us the ""Classic"" version. Why not give us the Classic Office? (Microsoft, have you heard of Coke Classic?)Come on Bill, some of us here are pulling for you, but you're just not listening!"
1,Office 2007 Productivity Reducer,"Since Amazon does not offer a zero star, I had to give it a 1 star. MS Office 2007 has a new user interface and no new functionality. The interface is drastically different from the old one and as a result productivity suffers. I now spend a lot of time online trying to find out how I used to do things. I don't understand why MS did this. This upgrade is not an upgrade, is is a repackaging of office 2003 with a new layer of complexity ontop of the software. I would return the product if it were possible. I have already uninstalled it and have switched back to 2003. Also, documents created in office 2007 are not backwards compatible with documents created in office 2003; make sure you save your files accordingly."
2,No productivity boost for me.,"I've been using Office 2007 since early January 07 and am still struggling to locate Excel and Word commands that I use to be able to execute in split seconds while drinking coffee and talking on the phone. While some of the deeper functions are now more up front with this revamped format, the side affect is that the top level command interface is now significantly diluted with all the infrequently used features and functions. What really I miss in Office 2007 is no longer being able to use many of the common key-stroke commands, and being able to modify the Toolbar (now called ""The Ribbon"") interface from within the application. I really liked being able to customize the toolbars in previous versions of Word and Excel according to my own needs. While previous versions of ""Office"" had their problems, this latest version, so far, has definitely been a drag on my productivity."
1,Office 2007 - Microsofts arrogance at its best.,Office 2007 is nearly unusable. All the useful commands are spread out over mutiple ribbons making every task a challenge. There is no customizablity at all. You are stuck using the ribbons exactly as Microsoft created them. It is plain that they are so arrogant that they think they know what you need more then you do. They have also filled the software with frilly useless features that have no place in the professional world. They make it nearly impossible to create macros and if you do succeded at making one you can't place on any of the ribbons. This is without a dought the worst version the company has ever produced. It is quite clear the negative effect of no competion. Don't upgrade until you have absolutely no choice. The headache is not worth it. For every improvement in this program there are 10 negatives.
2,Doesn't Deserve Praise,"I bought and installed this product because I had a new computer and I required the tools to access and manage various work documents. I figured it would be a moderately useful upgrade on previous office products. However I was mistaken.This version of Microsoft Office takes the concept of ""bloatware"" to new heights ... it seems the folk at Microsoft have been distracted by their own interface trinkets and have forgotten to address even basic useability issues. The result is a program that is sluggish, counter-intuitive and presents a whole new learning curve, even for those who are/were familiar with previous versions of Office.If you have a lot of time on your hands to learn a ""new"" way of doing things that different without being better (frequently worse) - and you have no desire to work efficiently with your computer, then perhaps there would be nothing to complain about with this new version. Otherwise, I really can't recommend it."
1,"HORRIBLE, FORGET ALL YOU KNEW ABOUT 2003","This has to be the worse ""upgrade since millenium""It it NOT user friendlly and i really hate to see when it is deployed here where I work. These people are going to panic. I myself take the time to become an expert in software I use. 2007 is taking its toll. Nothing seems to be where you expect it to be. I am not impressed at all with it. I teach office 2007 suit and i myself am having a time with this. very frustrating. - 1 star."
1,Fisher Price has bought MicroSoft,"The new Office 2007 proves that Fisher Price has bought Microsoft. Or at least has strongly influenced their Human Factors design folks. If you are an old hand using the office products (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) you are going to HATE office 2007. Tabs have replace menus, buttons have replaced menu selections. It takes forever to figure out where they put things. It's slowed my productivity to a crawl. This is the best advertisement for Open Office that I've ever encountered. And Open Office is free. So why did I just pay $400 for misery????"
1,pirated software,"The product is not new, it's a pirated copy. It's just a CD in a sleeve, no literature, box or warranty."
1,never received,item never received. seller unresponsive I cancelled credit card payment fon non receipt after 4 weeks
1,Where is it?,"It is very hard to review this product, as I have yet to receive it. My account was debited almost two months ago. I have attempted to contact the seller three times, with no response. I am going to have to give this a very bad review!"
1,"LOL, Davemill (his review's below)","I had the same experience... the network administrator friend who helps me with my computer software and hardware was here and I asked him to show me how to do what should be a simple task in Office, but which I had been unable to figure out how to do. He has a genius IQ and I think he may have been a computer in another life... and was unable to do it!"
1,Requesting a Downgrade,"Horrible. Was forced to upgrade four months ago. Requesting a downgrade. No time to learn new word processors and spreadsheet utility programs, which, apparently, is what this is.Praying this goes the way of Microsoft Bob."
3,Easy install and some nice add-ons - but no compelling reason to update,"1. the packaging. Probably the worst software packaging yet devised. Don't assume you wont be breaking it open to get the discs out. You just might have to.2. the install. Fast and easy as an upgrade. Approximately five minutes from start to finish. One reboot. No glitches.3. new functionality. The ribbon menu at the top of the screen is nice. But it's all a bit so-what.4. should you upgrade? If you can afford it, and want some of the new menu functionality, then it's a nice upgrade. If you are happy with Office 2003, and don't care about easy-access menus, then don't bother."
1,MS Office Professional - a real turd - Excel continually crashes,"For a die-hard Windows guy, I have to say - I'm ready to move to a Mac and not have to deal with Microsoft. Excel crashes continually. I have now had this product for about 1 year. I have been having problems for about 8 months and have dealt with MS support through all of it, including 3 complete removal/reinstalls, etc. MS support still has no clue. I have now spent hours upon hours with them. It has been a total waste of my time and theirs. It is a clear case of ""Lost in Translation"", where a company has chosen to off-shore its support and yet has not followed-up to see if it really takes care of its customers. MS is truly not taking care of this customer...Microsoft Office Professional 2007 FULL VERSION [Old Version]"
1,Access is a nightmare!,"I didn't like the new ""ribbon"" idea at all. It has taken me months to get the menu, sorry ribbon, to look anything like it should. Contrary to Microsoft's belief, most workers do not get any time at all to configure software to look the way they want. If it isn't familiar our of the box, it is a failure.Access crashes all the time and has made me totally unproductive. I now work in Access 2003 instead.Avoid ... too many faults to list here in too many areas. What a total time-wasting pile of rubbish!"
2,Office 2007 Excel is slow ----- slow ---- slow!,"Microsoft Office Professional 2007 UPGRADEWhen I run spreadsheets with graphs Excel 2007 is about a third slower than Excel 2003. Obviously if you are looking for an increase in productivity, this is not it. I am also disapointed in the way Excel 2007 handles graphs on their own workbook page (not inbedded in a sheet) In Excel 2003 I could spread the graph across two monitors and the chart would contract if I narrowed the window. Excell 2007 puts the chart on two monitors with half on each moniter and is restricted in size to the size of paper you can use. If you contract the window, part of the chart disappears.Word appears to work OK.I have not tried Access, Publisher or Power Point yet.The cover says Accounting Express is included but it did not load when I installed Office 2007."
1,Happy to be free from Microsoft Office,"The brief story is that I purchased Microsoft Office 2007 in 2007 with an new HP computer. Functionally Microsoft Office was adequate - it was sometimes difficult and crashed for incomprehensible reasons but it was what was on the market. I installed it on two subsequent computers. The license was declared invalid when I installed it on a fourth computer. I only keep two computers at a time and I uninstalled on the the two discarded computers. Rather than hassle with customer nosupport at Microsoft I decided to give Open Office a tryout - I immediately forgot about Microsoft Office - Open Office is at least as adequate as Microsoft Word from an interface standpoint but, more importantly, no computer crashes and no upgrade fees."
2,Microsoft Office Professional 2007 Full Version,"We ordered and paid for two separate copies and only received the second disk in one box, no set up disk. I wrote and no one got back to me.So if you don't need what you paid for go ahead and buy from them."
4,Good service from supplier. Product hard to access,"I was very satisfied with the supplier. Contact and delivery information were excellent and the product arrived in the time promised. However, it was very difficult working with Office 2007 and I actually had to contact my computer's manufacturer to assist with getting the software uploaded onto my desktop. I have not yet had the time needed to seek similar assistance from my laptop's maker. Excellent service from the supplier, but maybe the Microsoft corporation is too big..."
2,Defective CD,"I purchased the product at a discounted price. I received the product promptly, but it was defective. Calling Microsoft was no help. The product key did not work to activate the on-line version I downloaded. So, I returned the product. It's been over a week and I'm still waiting for the refund. I've since re-purchased the product (full price) from a local office store. It loaded with no problems and is working fine."
1,Bad shipping never got package,I never got my package. I would recommend not to order from mimcom because he will never ship your package.
1,Dissatisfied,I never received the product. I order this product twice from two separate indepedant dealer associated with Amazon and it is now 5 weeks later and I still don't have the software to use. I am very unahppy.Bob Z
4,Just so you know...,"There seems to be some misinformed people on this website that thing that the Satan in the book is the evil ""Satan"" which decieved adam and eve and such. However the book clearly states that he is not: He assures the three boys that he is not /that/ Satan, but only named after the fallen one."
5,Eerie Story Of Both Divine & Mundane Implications,"I shall be forever grateful to my sardonic 7th grade English teacher for making this required reading. Who is the mysterious stranger? Is he God or the Devil or just some terrifying conjurer? Ultimately, it really doesn't matter as the little boy in this story learns that fate can be a hard master & that hope and courage are the only weapons with which to fight it."
5,A Staggeringly Sublime Work of Art,"This is one of the finest personal allegories I've ever read. I was struck by the literary quality of the work -- quality which wasn't sacrificed by a quantity of painful emotional content. The ending was NOT unhappy or cynical; it was an expression of an artist, an insightful social satirist trying to be honest enough to, at the end of his life, turn that insight onto himself. The result is astonishing, a powerful account of one man retrieving the disparate parts of his self after a life of physical and spiritual fragmentation."
1,CHEAP!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I bought this and tried to make hummus and it started smoking!!! I was so disappointed. I did NOT have a receipt, so I bought ANOTHER one. ....the first time I used it, it was fine. I was relieved. ....THEN the 2nd time I used it, it started shaking and then stinky white smoke came out the back AGAIN!!! I couldnt believe it. I don't think Black and Decker have very good products at all. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,expensive junk,"I also got two of these. The first one started smoking and burnt out on the second use (I was mixing softened butter and flour. It should have been able to handle it). I returned it. The second one hasn't been any better. The plastic center of the grating blade came apart and won't stay together, so it's not usable. It's going to cost me $25.00 to get a replacement blade. Forget it!"
2,look for another one,"This Food processor just didn't make it.We had it less than two months and it stopped grinding while the motor continued going and it started to smoke.I was able to get it to work a little longer but it won't turn off unless I slam my fist against the button or twist the top off. It is also a pain to clean. Food gets stuck under the stem and whenever I am blending liquids (ie eggs) of some sort, the stuff leaks out.My daughter cut her finger on the slicer disc while taking it out of the dishwasher.Maybe there is a better one out there."
2,buy something else,"I used this, maybe three or four times in two years and then I took it out one Thanksgiving and it just didn't work. When it worked, it worked fine."
1,They don't make them like they used to,"I had a Black and Decker processor that I got as a wedding present over twenty years ago, and it never let me down once. When it was time to get a new one, I got this 1500 thinking that it's a B&D and I can't go wrong. Well as as soon as I tried to grate some cheese the plastic ring on the shredder/grater blade snapped off. The next time I used it a metal pin in the pastic cover that holds the blade securely broke the plastic groove it was in. Too bad B&D went down the drain through the years."
1,Don't bother,"This is the worst Food Processor that I have ever worked with.Two of them stripped their gears when I tried making bread according to the direction in the manual. The motor kept turning, but the spindle did not. What good is a 500 watt motor if the gears cannot handle a heavy dough? It could not process the dough. It also does not have overload protection."
1,"Save your money, buy a Cuisinart!","I bought this as a gift two years ago after the reviews here, and Consumer Reports rated it a good buy. It's good at first, but I've had hamsters that lived longer! The shredding blade broke on the second use. After about the 6th or 7th use, some kind of black material started flying out of the bottom, and then it died, with the mysterious burnt plastic smell everyone talks about. I'm amazed there hasn't been a recall and I'm disappointed that B&D would sell such a poor quality product. Just bought a new Cuisinart at Costco. Spent more, but it is OUTSTANDING!"
1,Reversible slicer/shredder disc doesn't work,Wish I can rate it as no stars! Save your money. This was a complete disaster. The reversible disc doesn't work. The shredder-side of the disc isn't sharp enough to shred. Can't even cut my finger on it even if I tried.The cup is very flimsy! Too bad it cannot be returned since it was a present for my mom!
1,Two for two,"I thought the first one breaking the gear assembly was one of those things. Black and Decker is a quality brand, right? Wrong, apparently. I bought another and it broke on its first use - on cream cheese. This food processor couldn't cope with **cream cheese**.Extremely shoddy merchandise. Find another one."
1,Black and Decker make worst appliances,"Some years ago I bought a BD food processor. It worked four times then the gear inside cracked in half. Recently I was stupid enough to give them another try. This one worked exactly three times,now it makes a grinding noise and does not spin. How do they sell these?"
1,It was good untill It stops working.,"This is my first food processer.I buy this food processer in apr. 2004, and after that I went on a vacation so I actually started to use it before 2-3 months. It was really good untill it works, but one day It suddenly stop working with the little burning smell. I find out the book which come with that, and I was happy to see 1 year's warranty for the product.I called the customer service, but they says they can't do anything for that because the product lot number was old and they can't cover that under the warrenty.but the manual of the product says that this product has one year warrenty. So I am really disappointed.so consider to bye little expencive food processer, instead of buying this."
1,processor frustration,"For Christmas we asked for a food processor and were given the Black & Decker FP1500 Power Pro II. I was so happy for my wife as it would make her life so much easier. I read the instructions and we got ready to chop some veggies. My wife kept cutting everything small, I told her you don't need to cut everything so small. We placed small pieces in the processor and it continually stopped working. I was very frustrated by how little it took to stop the blades. This thing is going back and I will not be buying a Black and Decker. In the end it turned our excitement into major frustration."
1,"Don't Waste Your Money! Previously Rated 4 Stars, Now 1.","I rated this food processor after receiving back in January with 4 stars. It is a nice food processor, when it works! I had to ship it back to B&D in June for a replacement since the motor burned out on it. Mind you I only used it sparingly and had probably only used it 6-8 times when that happened. Now here we are in September and I burned out the motor on the replacement model after using it only ONCE! And I'm not grinding meat here, I'm just chopping veggies. The company has been great at sending a replacement, but this time I'm hoping they refund my money because the food processor isn't worth a dime if it's not reliable and I have to ship it back every few months. Next time I'll spend more and get a name brand you can trust!"
1,Unreliable Food Processor,I used this food processor for 3 times only and never exceeded half of the capacity and still it broke!!!! it seems that there have been many complaints about the same problem: gear problems. i.e. the motor spins but the blade doesn't. I opened the machine and found out that the gear is made of plastic!!! it was all rubbed.I don't recommend this product at all.
2,"Lots of watts, but little attention to desgin","One of the big reasons why you buy a processor w/ a higher power output is to knead dough--and this machine is not designed well for that specific task. The dough blade is stubby plastic that allows much of the ""capacity"" to be wasted, with flour pooling underneath it. Also, the wet dough at the top spills up through the dough blade, out of the center, and then leaks under the bowl! What a mess. The motor starts to stink like burned-rubber-effort if you knead for more than one minute. And finally, the dough paddle is IMPOSSIBLE to clean on the inside (after it's gotten all that leaked dough up and inside it). This machine is powerful enough, and thus makes a good batch of pesto, but is badly designed."
1,DOA,"I received my food processor for Christmas. I had noticed the same processor at a different store that came with a bonus blade for fine shredding. I decided to see if I could buy accessories for mine online. I could not find any accessories or replacement parts for the Power Pro II. I was concerned about the number of unfavorable reviews I came across during my search. Despite the numerous negative comments concerning the motor going out, I decided to keep it. I used it for the first time tonight to make a sauce and was only halfway finished when it stopped working! I strongly recommend NOT purchasing this food processor!"
4,New Features are Nice after you learn the New Toolbars,I beta tested the new office since last year. I had already spent lots of time in the help section and online learning the program. I really liked the new junk folder in outlook and decided to spring for the program after the beta and trail versions ran out.
2,Another Major Dissapointment,I only purchase this upgrade because my original OEM package did not have powerpoint.What I ended up with is another brain fart by Microsoft. What possessed them to go out of their way to incovenience long time users of the products is beyond explanation.What I have now is hours of lost productivity resulting from a completely remodeled GUI. LIke I really to spend my days learning a new interface. For what. What gain in functionality am I benefitting from.As far as I concerned from heere on out. Microsoft is populated by a bunch of jerks trying rip off the corporate world. Too bad they don't have to compete on merit.
4,Good Deal on MS Office,"Very good price from Greatbuy Software Outlet. Product arrived in a few days in quality outer packaging. As for the program itself, I like the latest changes to MS Office. I have used other versions over the past 12-15 years and I like the way the menus/ribbon work on this update. Using Excel and Outlook much more than Word, the changes to these programs definitely seem to be an advance for MS in terms of point-and-click facilitation. The license for installation on a second PC is an added bonus."
4,Great Office Suite,"I have been using the Microsoft Office products since their introduction many years ago. This upgrade (2007) looks and feels somewhat different than past versions, but once you get used to it...it is fine...even better than before because a lot of the commonly used functionality is right up front, not buried in sub-menus. The help function is much more user friendly as well.Great Product!"
3,Office 2007 not as friendly as previous editions,"We think Microsoft took a step backwards with Office 2007. While it is prettier looking graphically, it is far less intuitive and Office Outlook is simply unstable compared to the Office 2003 version it replaced. Most staffers who've tried it think there are more keystrokes needed to do the same thing. We've spent many frustrating moments trying to figure out what buttons to push to get it to do what we want.We have several other computers in our small office and we will not be upgrading the others to the new version. Sorry Microsoft, but we only gave it a three, but probably deserves less."
1,The Worst,"Windows 7 on my new HP computer is pretty good. No complaints there (so far). But the so called MS Office ""upgrade""? The worst piece of software design I've ever seen! Ribbons? Really? This is the most ill-conceived, illogical, and un-user friendly piece of junk I've ever seen produced. Luckily, I still have my old CD ROM version of MS Office 2000. AND I found out it is still compatible with Win 7 (shhhhh, don't point that out to those greedy ****** at Microsoft). I'll be deleting the new Office as quickly as possible and installing my old Office 2000."
4,No big deal!,"I upgraded form Office 2000 to Office 2007, expecting to see major improvements. I was disappointed. Office 2007 has some enhancements, but it also has some glitches. If I had been able to try it first, I probably would have just stuck with my old version of Office."
2,How do I open the box?,I am a fairly well educated person who is handy around the house. It took a 25 minute call with Microsoft customer support to get the box open. Customer support had to pull up a diagram and walk me through 18 steps.
4,Microsoft Office 2007 Standard Upgrade,My purchase was based on an upgrade to Office 2007 at work and wanted to be consistent at home. Excel functionality is better than 2003 and other areas are very similar. The look is a little different and took me a short period of time to figure out. If you're open to a little change then you'll be fine. The one issue I had was with Outlook's installation and Microsoft tech support was great in solving the problem.
1,Worthless,"Claims to be ""great for small business"" but every open window of the softwaresays ""Not for commercial use"" at the top.Oh, and the new packaging is the worst I've ever come across. nearly impossible to open. If they were trying to design a product to irritate people, they really couldn't do a better job.This product has had one good effect. It's finally sent me over to Open Office."
1,Open Office is free -- get it instead,"[...]OpenOffice: open source ""equivalent""All the power 90% of you people need, and zero cost. TINY download. SMALL space consumption on drive. EVEN a portable version. Can open and save Microsloth documentsFREE. no licensing hassles. no demonic EULA."
3,Microsoft Office Standard 2007 Upgrade,was not happy with the upgrade at first but have gotten used to the difference in the old system.
3,Has bugs in the program,"The Excel program loses ""comments"" which you have to reset. On a few occasions my Word shows little number buttons in lieu of the picture icons in my tool bar.I also have to do HELP frequently to find where they're hidden some of the functions I'm familiar with."
1,"I hope I can soon afford a Mac...Vista soured me, Office 07 is sending me packing","I've used MS Word since the mid-90s, and this is like a slap in the face from Microsoft. I can't imagine they tested this with anyone not involved in its development. Everything one needs and has learned to access in earlier versions has been spread to hell and back. It does auto-formatting contortions a python would be proud of. I had to set up a task bar with all the old icons...heck, I can't even describe the struggles I'm having. I got this suite on the cheap (educator's discount), and am going back to using Open Office, which I had installed on my new machine to tide me over till I got MS Office. Microsoft, for God's sake, stop changing stuff simply for the sake of change, and before you foist another such abomination on the public, take a few users of old versions and have them give it a run...and I mean average users--the kind who don't need or want every damn cutesy thing you can come up with."
1,DO NOT DO IT!!,"I am far from an expert, and I have spent many hours trying to get things to work, but this - and VISTA - are the worst! for the neophyte, it is very difficult. MS seems to be trying to be ""cute"" and fancy, but they do not have much for the ordinary user. My advice is STAY WITH XP & 2003 as long as you can. Maybe when the USERS get things straightened out, it will be better."
2,BEWARE before you buy!!,"Beware! Even though the official MS Office website states taht yo can purchase the $240 upgrade version as long as you are a licensed user of any version beside the student version between 2000 and 2007 - if you purchased your version with the computer (as OEM) you are NOT eligible to do anything other than to put 2007 on THAT computer ONLY - you cannot transfer it - not even once. So, if like me, you bought a new computer and wanted to upgrade, you're out $240 - as I am. And I'm seething. The MS guy told me that OEM version upgrades ""live and die"" with that computer - but I can't use the old computer and it never said that at the website when I carefully checked to ensure I was eligible to purchase. MS continues to do this sort of junk, so my next upgrade is going to be a real upgrade: a MAC. All my buddies who use Macs are quite happy."
2,Sad how Microsoft has gone downhill,"Office 2007 may seem ok at first. The menus are all ok for me to use, so I don't have to build menus from scratch. But after installing the trial, I found numerous complaints that would make me want to trash it if I had it.1) Word doesn't want to integrate with Outlook very well2) Everytime I want to send a mail message I accidentally click on 'Paste'3) The flags and categories for Outlook are annoying and just add to the time spent administering email without helping me more than Outlook 20034) Along with all of the other Microsoft products I've tried in the past month, it hangs, corrupts its own files, and generally takes up too much memory.I'll stick with Office 2003, which doesn't have nearly as many flaws. There is no reason for me to upgrade.I'm also back to IE6, Money 2006, and will not upgrade to Vista.I've lost volumes of emails because I can't downgrade my Outlook files.Good Job in alienating your customers, Microsoft. (so what's new?)"
2,Frustrated,"This product does not interact with an earlier version of Peachtree or Outlook, so I am unable to use spreadsheets to create documents, nor does it look at my Outlook Address Book. It is also frustrating to find some of the formatting that I was used to in the tool bar. I need to give it more time since that was a feature that had been reviewed before. Hopefully, I will get used to it in due time - but the inability to interact with Peachtree or Outlook is extremely disappointing."
1,Terrible!! Don't buy this!!,"I bought this product because my Office 2003 was old and since I was doing business emails, I wanted to be up-to-date. Big mistake! The new toolbar is a disaster!! Took me two hours to do find out how to do a mailing label. ACT doesn't read this new version so I couldn't use Word as my word processer for ACT applications. It was a mess. I uninstalled and went back to 2003."
3,Jerusalem Diamond,"It was pleasant reading, but no-where near the standard of The Physician or The Shaman. I sometimes question the obligatory love/sex inclusion, when none appears to be warranted, especially in this novel."
4,Yhe Jerusalem Diamond,Also this author is using foreign names and languages without bothering to have them checked by somebody who knows. Very careless !In Spanish there is no name like ESTABAN. It is ESTEBAN.Same with BENVENISTO. It should be BIENVENIDO.I doubt very much there exists a family name in German written DEITRICH. It must be DIETRICH.My guess is that the yiddish name for fool is NARR and not NAHR.How nuch can it cost to have these things corrected before printing a book?
3,"good, but not enough to make me want to read more by this author.",Characters sound 21st century. Archeological info believable. Story just long enough and geographical information is believeable and gives you the feeling of learning about a part of the world that you know you won't be able to travel to yourself.
2,So far so good,"This book has an interesting story including the heritage of the family, of course a diamond, but it has some characters that doesn't have to be there. At the end of the book the only thing he has is the diamond, he has no family, no lover, etc.The question is: Will you change your actual family for your heritage?"
5,Good for international business,"I found this multicultural Spanish business dictionary extremely useful for doing business in Latin America. Spanish business terms can vary from country to country, and this is to my knowledge the first dictionary of its kind that addresses this issue which is critical in the global market."
5,The only multicultural Spanish business dictionary available,"Business terms vary from Spain to Latin America, and within Latin America. This dictionary provides the variant business terms for the leading Spanish-speaking trading countries, which makes it one of a kind.It also provides the latest computer terms used in business, an indispensable feature for today's business. Highly useful."
2,where are the batteries??????????,every picture of this product shows it with batteries. but they are nowhere to be found. somebody goofed up!!!!! feels good though. thankfully i had some batteries
5,OH!!!! God what a great feeling when using this.,Tingles the head so bad that U will hate it when U stop using this thingy. I Love this more without the vibrating heads.
1,"Cheap, greasy imitation","We love the Ting Ting borrowed from a neighbor enough to purchase our own. We ordered a Ting Ting but, instead, were sent a cheap replacement branded ""Don Long"". Not only was the product cheaply made, but all the tines were coated with grease and dirt."
1,No tingles here,I love head massages but this didn't do that. Felt like wires poking me in the head yuck
3,not too bad,"feels pretty good, but it is a little flemsy. about what you'd expect for the price. It's not like a real massage or anything, but I do use it occasionally, and it does get the blood flowing, so it's descent for the price."
5,Made my wife happy!,"I was looking for something like this because my wife is always asking me to scratch her head. After reviewing many options I picked this particular model and it has worked out perfectly, she loves it. The vibrating tings (tongs?) really give her scalp a deep massage, and she can use it on herself (or I can drive for her). The design is also nice, the arms can rotate so that the whole unit is pretty flat (good for packing) and since they're copper they can be bent to fit any head shape or size.Overall a very worthwhile investment, recommended for anyone looking for a head scratcher / massager."
4,WAW I FEEL SLEEPY,"its really nice for relax and massage ur head i love it ,, i have before the normal one without the battery so its fun and u feel good but its heart ur head with more use but with this one u can use it just attack it with ur head XD"
3,READ THIS if you are looking for something better!,"I've been looking for a scalp massager, and almost bought this one until i read the reviews and so many of them said that this massager was great, but not as great as they wanted it to be, so i continued searching.....Ok so for those of you who are searching for ""the best scalp massager"" check out the felicity 5 in 1 massage system. It comes with an attachment like the one this massager has, but it also comes with one that will massage the middle of your head like so many of you have expressed that you desire. [...]"
1,Probably the cheapest quality thing that's ever arrived from Amazon,"If you're thinking about ordering this POS, just go into the bathroom, take $12 out of your wallet, and flush it down the toilet. You'll get more enjoyment out of the process. My vibrating head massager came with broken plastic and wires that had become unsoldered. Even for ""made in China"" this thing is ridiculously cheap. By ""cheap"" I don't mean inexpensive. I mean CHEAP. Not only that, but the tines are a heavier gauge wire than they should be, and actually don't feel as nice on the scalp as the lesser-expensive, manually operated units. Move along, nothing to buy here."
3,Does what it says,"Only after using it for a while the smell of melting plastic comes from the battery compartment. The ""arms"" are a bit stiff and don't really work like the original but it still does what it has to. I hope the melting plastic thing isn't serious"
2,Thought I'd like this being electric...,"I read several reviews that said they loved the electric vibration of this item. I got one based on those reviews, I was sorry I did. It is very loud and vibrates too hard!! Nothing relaxing about it at all!! I'll use it without the thing turned on I guess."
2,Too buzzy,"I would not recommend this massager for tension headaches, as the sound and frequency of the buzzing motor are more annoying than comforting.Although the tips are rubberized, the vibration causes the metal spines to move around and eventually touch one another, which makes the massager rattle noisily. If the spines were completely rubberized, this rattling might be eliminated, leaving only the buzzing of the motor to contend with.I would have to try another product before I am sold on this concept."
1,The WORST thing I've EVER gotten from AMAZON,"I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS DEVICE. IT WORKED WELL FOR ABOUT 1 WEEK. WAS VERY, VERY GOOD FOR ABOUT 1 WEEK AND FOR REASONS NO ONE CAN EXPLAIN IT STOPPED WORKING.I have every intentions on sending it back to you because it's GARBAGE. Amazon should be ashamed to sell such CRAP!"
3,Cheap but functional doohicky,"Relatively cheap plastic and metal, the head copper pieces bend back (out of custom massaging shape) fairly easily. The Battery cover door, in the handle, doesnt close fully, it swings shut, but doesnt click shut, we either need to hold the door down so the batteries dont pop out or tape it shut. For the price, its not bad, but it is not very high quality, and it could definitely use an adjustment setting/option for the speed of vibration."
5,What a wonderful gift!,"I got this as a Christmas gift from my husband, and I was initially very skeptical. I get frequent headaches, some of which are migraines, so I'm definitely willing to try some different things to get relief from the pains. Ting Ting worked wonders, giving me relief in a matter of seconds! With mild headaches, it gets rid of the ache quickly and keeps it away. I found with the strong migraines that it definitely decreases the pain to almost nothing while turned on; however, it didn't get rid of it entirely, and I found the migraine creeping back after a bit. The level of pain improves significantly, but, for me, it wasn't a cure-all. Don't throw out the migraine pills just yet, but I highly recommend this for people with or without headaches of any kind. It will be used over and over and over again in our home, for sure. Enjoy!"
1,Horrible Product,"Beware, you may not receive the same item which is displayed. Cheap plastic. Even the copper wires are not proper. Horrible."
4,Good gift.,If you're not quite sure what to get someone this is good idea. Relaxing and feels so good. Who doesn't like a head rub?!
2,Honestly,"Good company, good service. But the legs of the massager are too rigid. So t is not comfortable for your head. Besides, the vibration speed is too high, so that does not help. Trust me. I would prefer a non - motorized one."
3,You get what you pay for,If you know anything about this type of product then don't expect that this will produce AMAZING results. The product was too big for my head and had to be maneuvered too much to get results. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,couldve been much better,"The guy was overacting in this film. Paula brought life to this film. I waited for it to hit free streaming so it was free. Through the entire movie, I kept saying Boy, he's a terrible actor and where did they find this cast? You have to start somewhere so maybe it will be better next time."
5,Perfect Collector's Item for EVERY Lucy lover!,"This doll is absolutely perfect for Lucy lovers who can't get enough of her! I'm just sorry I missed the premier doll -- the Vitameatavegamin Commercial.Not only are the details on the doll precise, but the memories of the show which this brought back are worth the price alone.A must buy!"
3,Barbie as Lucy,Barbie as Lucy is a wonderful idea. But I can only give this doll 3 stars. This is because I do not feel the facial features are as close a match to Lucy as the other two Barbies in the series (Lucy's TV Commercial and Italian Movie Lucy). But still a great piece of pop culture art. And a must have to complete this collectors set.
5,Give your child a great start to reading & writing!,"As a an elementary school teacher, I know that kids definitely need literacy activities at home. As a mom, I also know that it's hard to fit everything that kids need into the day! That's why 1-2-3 Reading & Writing is so great! It has fabulous activities that you can easily do at home with your pre-school child to give him/her early experiences with reading & writing. It's very simple to follow, and you can use things you already have around the home for these great hands-on activities. For example, some of the activities use soap, golf-tees, tongue depressors, old magazines, buttons, and even snacks to teach your child beginning problem solving, eye-hand coordination, alphabet learning, etc. Most of the activities don't take a lot of prep-time, which is perfect for busy moms! This has great helps for making learning FUN! Isn't that how it should be anyway?"
1,The Empty Chair: Handling Grief on Holidays and Special Occasions,"I didn't find this book helpfull at all. I'm seriously tired of hearing and reading ""your loved one died you didn't"" because it doesn't feel that way. I hope if you try this book in your grieving process you can get more from it than I did"
1,It wasn't strong enough,"I ordered this item so I could put a 8 inch plate in our display case. It wouldn't hold up the plate? I was a waste of money.The photo that goes with this item, doesn't represent it well."
1,Not the same as the picture (no wide back),"This 6"" plate stand does not match the picture. I told Amazon to look into the picture since the back is not shown correctly. I want the wide stance for more stability. Returning what they sent (thin back like shown in the 9"" picture)."
3,plate holder,i ordered an arcrylic set of several plate holders (easels) andwhat i received was 1 and was charged $8.99---but as i reviewedmy order it appears that 1 easel should be at most $4.99--and ihave no idea where the set went
4,an attractive masculine ring - very comfortable,"Yes, the blue stone shown on screen is darker than the actual stone on the ring, but the blue is unmistakable, the ring is a good weight and very comfortable. There is great variation in natural stones, so I'm not the least disappointed in my purchase. A very comfortable attractive ring."
2,blue topaz,this ring i am not as saticfied with. it iz not as dark blue az i thought it wld be. but from now on i'll juz but diamondz.
2,Too tall,Somewhat poorly designed web site.(Hard to figure out how to return item)Cost of return and restocking fee made it unfeasible to return item. I will donate it since I can not use it.
2,Not for walking,"Designed for wheels, but not for shoes. The angle chart is probably fine for wheelchairs or scooters, but is not appropriate for walking. If you are seeking a ramp for someone to walk over thresholds rather than step, it is necessary to get a much longer ramp...and it seems to me the price increase for the longer ones is our of proportion. Haven't yet found the solution for my 88 year old parent; may have to construct one myself."
4,Just what we needed,"I ordered this ramp for a 1.5"" threshold. It works very well, although it was an inch too wide for our doorway, so be sure to measure first. We had to have it cut professionally."
5,Finally found it!,"I have found a product of unsurpassed quality hat does exactly what it advertises it does! Exceptional product - If you need one, and you know who you are, you could not do better Than this product! I will purchase more!"
1,Junk,"Total junk. Didn't trim at all! I asked my husband if he wanted to try the small head for trimming his beard and moustache and he came to the same conclusion - throw in with our electronic recycling. I ordered this to see if it could replace my yearly purchase of my lilac-colored Panasonic bikini trimmer, but no such luck. Love my Panasonic, but was hoping I could get an equivalent product for less money. Hope springs eternal."
3,Ok trimmer,"I have overly sensitive skin so that means I can't shave or wax down there. I decided to try this trimmer to try to trim all my hair off. I've used it for a couple of years but I can't say it's a great trimmer. It does get me a very close trim though, not just in my bikini area. The thing that's frustrating is how easy the top half snaps in two. I have to keep snapping it back in place and that's really annoying. When I received it I didn't expect the material to be so cheap, but for the price I should have seen it coming. I've never used the shape templates and have no use for them. I'm replacing this trimmer now because the blades have begun to dull and it's nicking my skin a lot."
5,the perfect hair trimmer!,"Let me just say, this is an amazing set! The trimmer does not pinch my skin like others that I have tried, and I love how it has that little light on it, that makes trimming those *ahem* delicate areas a bit eaiser. The stencils are fun to play with, but take a little getting used to using, but it deff makes trimming your hair into shapes so much eaiser."
3,So So..,THis trimmer works ok. Can't really trim very close but the small head makes it easy to maneuver. The construction could be improved as it feels really cheap which is expected for the price.
4,First Time,"Destiny's End is a fascinating story and good read. I was able to identify with the main character Jake and found myself wondering how I would have acted given the tough choices he had to make concering his marriage. The other main character stole my heart almost from the beginning. Ellen struggled to discover her own path and the author did a terrific job in building her character throughout the book. Jake's love for the outdoors and his road adventure were entertaining and also informative. I've been to many of the places he visited and I understand why he made his ""pilgrimage"". I also found my way during times of trouble by taking to the trails. Destiny's End is a terrific first novel by Cal Muzikar and is a well written book and I highly recommend it to the members of the boomer generation. I'm one of them."
3,Dont judge a book by its title,While this book has usuful information for a non-student it reads more like a college text. It is more appropriate on a class reading list then for the casual safari goer.
1,Certainly NOT very good condition,"I was somewhat disappointed in the condition of the book that was listed as ""very good condition"". It was a library book with stickers all over it and worn cover. The book itself is fine, but I will be reluctant to purchase used books in the future."
5,Worth it's weight!,"Just returned from two weeks of safari in Tanzania. We took only three books with us. Two field guides and a novel. Based on others reviews I chose the full colour photo guide by Withers and this one; the Estes. This guide is worth it's weight. It's not small. There is no way it's content could be edited down. It's all important. When you see an Eland bull lower it's horns the Estes explains why. When you see a group of elephants and they are all male the Estes tells you why. My ten year old was so glad to learn so much about her favorite monkeys.(the Black Faced Vervet!)The explanations and observations really enriched our animal viewing encounters. Small black and white line drawings. No photographs. Easy to read and understand the symbols and charts. Very much like a text book but, much more interesting. Wishes for future edition would be the inclusion of the social behavior of the Ostrich as they are such a large and obvious member of the Savannah."
2,Did not find it that useful in E. Africa,"The pictures are black and white drawings. We brought this and the Audubon Society Guide to African Wildlife (or something like that) and we much preferred the Audubon book. It was more compact, had a durable vinyl cover and had color pictures with quick facts on each animal - which is really what you want in the moment on a bumpy safari game drive. I would get the other book instead."
1,Does not fit Graco Duoglider!!,"I bought this to go with my Graco Duoglider stroller and when I got it, it wouldn't fit all the way on it. I ended up giving it to one of my friends who has a Kolcraft double stroller and it won't properly fit hers either. I did use it for my single stroller and it was too big. I'm going to buy the Graco Quattro Duo here soon to replace the Duoglider and hopefully this will fit on it since it's shorter than the Duoglider.Edit: I got the Quattro Tour Duo stroller and this fits perfectly on it."
5,Good buy.,"This mount is solid, stable, and well made. I was a little apprehensive about using a suction cup, but it is extremely secure."
5,1 Year later...,"I've had this a little over a year now and it's still stuck to the windshield in the exact spot I originally put it. I have an old (large) satellite radio mounted to it and every few months, as the temperature changes, I'll have to re-adjust the angle of the screen from slightly sagging. With the satellite's original mount, I was adjusting it almost daily. This mount is FAR superior to the one that came with my Sportster Replay. For the price, you can't beat it."
4,Better for sports,"I love these holsters. They do break a little easier than others. I've replaced two already, however, they are inexpensive and the super-strong clip is way better if you jog and don't want to have your phone bounce right off. I just buy three at a time."
1,A Waste of Money,"I have had cellet phone holsters in the past that lasted me years, unfortunately this one broke after about two weeks. I used it normally and when I unclipped it one day the very fragile frame design snapped in two pieces. Quite disappointing."
5,excellent film,"This is a timely and thoughtful film, dealing with a sensitive issue (sexual abuse by Catholic priests, of their students in a Catholic school) in a careful and powerful way.It is well written, well acted, well directed. A great success for writer/director Nathan Scoggins.I highly recommend it."
3,Misdirected and Disconnected,"Sexual abuse of young boys by Roman Catholic priests interests me especially since the church and pope are so homophobic and anti-gay. This movie disappoints me because it fails to deal directly with this timely issue, but plods along a path of innuendos and half-truths. I don't even remember hearing ""sex"" or ""abuse"" in a story that looks, sounds and feels amateurish.Even though I've played the scene over and over again I can't figure out how Washington discovers the dead priest submerged in a dark swamp. Was this sloppy editing? Why was the young priest not questioned as a murder suspect? What happens to the headmaster who covered up the homicide? This screenplay was poorly written and misdirected."
1,Kindle is not ready for atlases,This is a review of the free sample.Kindle's zoom is not yet capable of enlarging the maps of this or any other atlas so they are readable without a magnifying glass. This is an excellent book in a print edition and I highly recommend it in print but not Kindle.Amazon may wish to hold offering atlases such as this until it solves the basic readability problems.
4,More Disney trivia,If you have the other 2 games and you want more cards this is the best thing to buy but some of the cards seem like repeats from the game.If you do not want to buy the whole game this would be a great way to have fun but without the board game.The kid cards are great because each has a picture on one side and 5 easy questions on the other. Many of the cards are from the same movie so if you know the movie well you will do well.
2,ok,"I used it only once .In first use itself, round brown rust like patch came up.I wasn't expecting this poor quality from calphalonAfter using with oil it cured itself ..it is working fine nownot that much great buy"
3,handle is heavier than the pan and does not balance.,"this griddle is made from hard anodized material which is nonstick and it does get the job done.however, one thing bad about it is that it does not stay flat on the stove, because the handle is heavier than the griddle. so u cannot use it on a small burner, u have to use it on a large burner and u have to hold the handle most of the time if u want proper heat distribution. else the side opposite to the handle doesn't touch the burner and stays a little above, because the handle is heavy."
5,Excellent book. Shows the fake and how to prove it,A great read! Everything involving exposing frauds from the past to the present! Great history lessons of Houdini exposing psychics to modern day tv fakery. A must read!
3,Good book - bad typeface,"This is a good - not great - book on investigating paranormal claims, that should be of interest to the skeptical community. It has some interesting material on the classic spiritualist cases of Eusapia Palladino and Mina Crandon, as well as on Italian miracle relics and Indian god-men. However, I have to knock off a couple of stars: one for being a bit too self-promotional (one chapter is a laudatory interview with the author), and another star deducted for the publisher's obnoxious typeface that makes the text difficult to read.This is certainly not the first book I would recommend on the subject - that would be James Randi's much more comprehensiveFlim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions. Secrets of the Psychics is too hit-and-miss to be a good introduction to the subject of paranormal claims. But if you have already read Flim-Flam!, and are looking for more, this is not a bad addition to your collection - if you can get over the horrible typeface."
3,Talking clock,Good little clock for time and temperature but volume alittle weak for beyond three feet.
4,talking clock,"Very nice, I don't know that anyone needs to know the temperature of their room? A blind person uses this clock. The buttons on the back may need a cover so when they reach to push for the time they don't accidently unset it by squeezing them. Someone else does the setting."
3,Compact audible time and Temp device,"Small, egg-shaped audible time and temperature device, with digital display. ""Voice"" is a bit low and may be difficut to hear.As with many of these devices, an alarm is included--featuring ""chimes"" of different types. My elderly Friend's favorite is the ""Coo-Coo"".For a visually impaired person, I believe that this device is not as good as the Pyramid-type. But if you're ""Coo-Coo for Coco Puffs,...."
3,you get what you pay for----------cheap,"I am not blind and am otherwise able but bought this talking clock so I wouldn't have to turn the light onto learn the time and temp at night during sleep. The voice is tinny, fast, and not very understandable unless you hold itup to your ear. I will use it and remind myself that you get what you pay for. It IS worth 10 bucks, just don'texpect anything more. It looks cheap and may not last in which case it will be tossed."
1,not as expected,This is very hard to hear and understand.It was not what I expected. I bought this for my elderly grandmother because her vision is bad. Didn't work as expected. I would return it but that's too much trouble.
4,The Mayor of Lexington Avenue: in search of justice,"I enjoyed this novel. There are a number of twists and turns in the plot that kept my interest. The characters are an interesting mixture of the good, the bad and the opportunistic.By no means is this novel a challenging read, but it is an engrossing one. And, along the way Mr Sheehan shares some insights into many different existences.A recommended page turner, and I look forward to reading other novels by Mr Sheehan.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
4,Author Argues Against The Death Penalty,"The author, an experienced Florida trial lawyer, argues strongly against the death penalty thruout this book. The plot is centered around the circumstances of the false conviction and subsequent execution of a retarded nineteen year old set up to take the fall in a murder case by an ambitious prosecutor and corrupt police detective. The first part of the book seems to move and flow significantly better. I don't particularly like the use of the flashback chapters. But, all in all, I found this to be a reasonably good thriller with lot's of action even though I do support the death penalty."
3,A Partial Dissent,All the other posted reviews were so enthusiatic that I hate to be ambivalent. I thought the first half was compelling. Jack Tobin is too good to be true. The group he put together was just too easy. I enjoyed reading this book because I love a good story but Mr. Sheehan has not joined the first team yet. I await his second foray
2,Not All It's Cracked Up to Be,"Good writer, but predictable plot. I agree with a couple of other reviewers who felt the first and second halves of the book were written by different people. Characters are not exactly cardboard, but they are somewhat stiff and stereotypical. There's also a lot of contrived and predictable dialogue.My biggest problem was going from part 1 to part 2 and it was like, what the heck happened? We find ourselves ten years down the road with all kinds of important stuff having happened without being in the novel. The reader gets a quick update to bring us to present day, which was a major turnoff for me.The love interests that develop in part 2 are hokey. I also felt that part 2 was unbelievable in that our hero - a corporate lawyer without litigation experience - was taking a death penalty case, especially when he was taking time out for jogging and candlelit dinners when he had only a few weeks for trial prep. Any litigator worth his salt wouldn't do that."
1,Canoeist's Little BOok of Wisdom,Beware- I ordered books totaling over $25 for free shipping and they split it nto two orders with identical dates and charged me for shipping. This is as dirty a game as there is. After several years of good service Amazon has decided to stoop to a new low. Almost immediately there is no way to fix the order or to lave a complaint.
5,Just as Good or Better than Today's Stuff,"For some reason I can't get into Cathe's Gym Style series at all. I find it very boring and almost too much per muscle group. You would think this is like that, but it's somehow not boring at all with a good pace and an upbeat atmosphere. It might appear a bit dated but I love it. It has 2 to 3 sets per exercise, some of them drop sets. You can also easily pyramid up or down with your weight. It is really very effective, cued well and easy to add onto another workout because it's chaptered and gets right to the menu. Like the other reveiwers said it's a split workout designed to work different muscle groups on different days."
1,first time buyer,"I needed the book ""understanding Elem Algebra"" for OCC I was very happy when I saw it online for less than the school store after I purchased it I found the book I ordered was ""Understanding Elem Algeba sequel"" it was a total waste of money I had to buy the book at the school store anyway. Complete titles should be listed!!!"
2,Incomplete,"This book either fails to cover a couple of very important facts. Women do not enjoy shooting like men do, their hands are too small to properly hold many common service weapons, and they are afraid of the recoil and muzzle blast. These are biological factors that can't be overcome. This book deals with achieving the minimum, and meaningless, standards set by law enforcement academies and organizations. They have nothing to do with one's ability to function in a gunfight. Call me what you want but in sixteen years of law enforcement I have yet to see a woman who could be effective in any type of physical altercation involving a male opponent. If there were no double standard in the physical requirements, this would me a mute point anyway."
4,salon pass,i use it frequently to help in reducing pain in the back and the sciatica . again is easy to apply and helps.
3,Great Stuff,"My wife recommended that I use this product for my neck strains. Like many of the other reviewers, I am in love with the minty sensation the patches give you. However, other than the cool,refreshing feeling it gives you, it doesn't do much for my strain. It relieves the pain for a bit but it comes back within an hour or two. Having said that, I will still use these patches because I love the minty feeling."
5,Excellent pain reliever!,I bought this several months ago in an attempt to get some relief from my muscle and joint pain associated with Sjögren's Syndrome. I was hoping for at least some minor relief so I could quit taking so many NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen. Salonpas worked FAR better than I anticipated! The patches adhere easily and stay put. Pain relief occurs generally in about 15-20 minutes. I also have very sensitive skin and these don't bother me at all. No skin reactions whatsoever. I highly recommend this product.
4,Use it all the time,I have used this Salonpas fr 15 years. Takes the pain in 10 min. and it has no ordor. I give then away to friends and family. Ana
5,These are great!,I've used prescription patches and these patches. These have worked far better for me -- especially because they fit better on my neck and don't fall off.
5,I LOVE THESE PATCHES!,"I absolutely love these pain relief patches! They work better then anything I've ever tried! I was in a car wreck several months ago and my neck & shoulder hurt daily from it. These little guys really help dull the pain! I've found that if you take one patch off and put another one on, it can cause a burning feeling so I never put a new patch where I've just removed an old patch from. That could just be me though. I would highly recommend these to anyone with muscle soreness/tenderness! I think they're awesome and I'm glad I found them! I bought my 120 pack from Costco for $7.99!"
1,burned my skin,Shipping and price were fine. But the product burned my skin. I would not use it again. Now sitting with 119 patches will not use.
2,no good,i just bought this product today from walgreens for the pain in my elbow..dont kno where these pain came from but its been goin on for some time..anyway i bought this and put it on and i feel no diffrent at all!!..the pain is still there and i will not buy this again..
5,It works,This is my second order of this product because it realy does a good job. My order this time included an order for a friend who I had given some to try and he found them equally worthy of more.
4,Salonpas Patches,Meet my expectations and did a satisfactory job for my problem! If I can not get this product from my local Drug Store I will order this from Amazon.
1,Waaay cheaper at Costco!!!,"I went to my local Costco and they had these for 7.50 regular price. On sale, it was only $5 for the pack of 120!!! These work fantastic, Asians discovered this years ago."
3,Read the label on the package,"These are amazing patches, but I only gave them 3 stars because the product detail is wrong. It says they are 3 x 2 x 2. In reality, they are only about half that size and have less medication. I have had great success from using the larger patches on my lower back."
3,"effective pain relief, but smelly methol odors","Salonpas is similar to Bengay, TigerBalm, etc, but in a convienent patch form. I wasn't expecting the strong odor unfortunately. My wife cannot stand it (even though I can) so wearing that patches at night, when I want the pain relief the most is impossible."
2,I can't recommend this product,"I have a bad back and have used the large drugstore type pain patches for years. The price + reviews for this product sounded great, but I really can't recommend these to someone like me who has a chronic problem. they are just too small and the smell is horrendous, very very strong. I am not getting the relief from 2-3 of these that I got from one large patch. I am really sorry I bought 2 boxes, I will probably not use them."
5,not happy,"I GET THESE EVERY MONTH. ALWAYS--$38.76 ALL OF A SUDDEN, THIS MONTH WAS--- $46.56 I THINK I CAN GET A BETTER DEAL AT WALMART!!!!!"
1,Did not relieve osteoarthritis pain!,"After reading the product description and customer reviews, I ordered the product to relieve pain in mu knees and legs. I followed the directions for placing the patches. I expected some pain relief but got none. After applying the patches for several days with no pain relief, I discontinued using the product. I do not recommend the Solonpas Pain Relieving Patch for pain relief. Try instead topical creams, for example Blue Emu."
2,I don't recommend,"Hi - I bought these in hopes of relieving golfer's elbow in my left arm. I'd put these on my forearm area and then go have a golf lesson or go hit a bucket of balls. Well by the time I would finish, the skin would be on fire, and taking it off was like removing duct tape off of a hairy mans leg. VERY painful. My skin would remain red and sore for awhile. After about 3-4 times using them, I had to return them. It is possible if you use them on tougher not so sensitive skin that they would do what your looking for. But for sensitive area's like forearms, or neck etc, I do NOT recommend them."
1,ouch!,I wore this patch on the back of my neck for only ten minutes. The burning sensation was so acute that I removed it.I had a visible rectangular burn on my skin for over 48 hours. Watch out!
2,Burnt my skin,"I never thought my skin is sensitive and I don't have any allergy, but this patch burnt my shoulder skin. I thought burning feel is from menthol or active ingredients, but it actually burnt my skin. It is now all brownish and started to peal. It will probably take 2 weeks+ to get healed."
3,for sligt pain relief,"it will help to ease the pain slightly for muscles and may temporary reduce some joints pain , but it is not a magic so dont expect a big relief . off course it will differ from person to person depending on the situation and case..."
3,OK for some things. Not a miracle cure,"So far I have tried it on my back and on my knee. Doesn't seem to help the back any, but may have done some good for the knee. More importantly for some; it doesn't do any harm. It should be safe for at least a try."
5,Salonpas Pain Relieving Patch Changed My Life,"I have neropathy, fibromyalgia, and arthritis I am especially bothered in the cold New England weather. My friend suggested I try Salonpas I could not belive how quickly it worked and lasted for hours. I can put the patches on and in 15 min or less I am ready to go walking without pain.I will not allow myself to go without a suppy on hand. Patches work better than meds. My doctor has prescribed many prescriptions for my pain over the years, some of them very expensive and they did not work as well.Yeh Salonpas, I love you and will take you every where I go."
2,watch which one you buy,i bought the blue box of salonpas at walgreens for my sprained and strained shoulder. the doctor had my on pain meds but nothing was helping. saw the add on the tv and thought well it cant hurt so i tried them. worked wonders for my shoulder went to a diffrent walgreens to buy some more and got the smaller ones in a green and white box. apparently they are diffrent very diffrent i think ill go back to the blue box this green one made it hurt more. so if you try one and it doesnt work try the other you never know.
5,NGK Spark Plugs: Great product!,These plugs are a great product; the price was very good and shipping was fast. Thank you.
1,Yet another poorly written book,"This big was a huge disappointment. First, the photos are not rare, nor are they presented in good quality. Secondly, some of the pictures are misidentified, which makes me wonder how much research was done. A fine coffee table book but not a good source for those looking for rare photos of the last Romanovs. I recommend The Romanovs: Love, Power, and Tragedy. Much better."
4,"Good book, but not great","The photographs are beautiful. There are fewer of them than in most other Romanov photo collections, but then, I haven't seen most of them elsewhere, either. One quibble is that several of the photographs seem to be mistakenly identified-- which daughter is which, and so forth. Slightly annoying. The book could also have done with more accompanying text and descriptions. Most pages contain just one or two photographs with brief captions."
2,Not really worth buying,"Hmmmm, I was decidedly disappointed in this book. Many of the pictures contained within were very poor quality and there were some blatant mistakes in identification of the family members. A good many of the photographs are not new to the collector of Romanov books. I would not recommend this book if one is expecting to see anything new. I dont think Mr. Blair Lovell would have been pleased!"
4,It was good.,"It was a good book, but I hate it how they kept getting the Grand Duchesses mixed up, and they called Marie Olga and Olga Marie, it was very annoying."
4,Loved it!,"I thought it was a very good book with lots of nice photographs, but as said before, the names of the Grand Duchesses was changed and mixed a little and the author continually repeated himself. The years of the photographs and the ages of the Grand Duchesses in conjunction with this was also a little mixed at places. Other than that, it is a wonderful book and I love it!"
3,"Not altogether bad, not altogether good","I'm afraid the endorsement by HRH Prince Michael of Kent creates a false expectation. The photo identifications in this book are far from accurate. The author has made several false identifications; she can't tell Olga or Anastasia from Maria, and has made one or two very careless mistakes, such as suggesting that a particular photo was taken by a particular grand duchess (who just happens to be in the middle of the picture). There are some photographs that I have not seen in other Romanov photocollections, and the information contained in the text SEEMS spot on. However, I would not recommend this for anyone who does not have extensive familiarity with the Romanov family already."
4,Works for me!,"Plenty of content in the reviews below. I enjoyed the cutting-edge medical content. Pretty close to what I've been reading in the medical journals, and the story around which that topic is wrapped provides an interesting vehicle.It's always interesting to read the opinons of others - especially on the same topic. Some folks obviously got worked up over this book. Make up your own mind...it's well worth the time."
4,Judas Virus,"Great medical science fiction with some great medical ethical questions to ponder. Reality of even though it is fiction, it is possible with science advancement."
5,Just as described,"The product was just as described, it works perfectly. I have used this brand before and never had any issues with it. It's just a great product.I received it quickly."
3,Jhelisa - Whirl Keeps Turning,"The High Steppers (otherwise known as Lee Hamblin) give WHIRL KEEPS TURNING a more percussive beat and sprinkles in a more electronic instrumentation. The original vocals, however, are kept intact -- you'd be a fool to mess around too much with her voice with traditional mixes such as these. Outside, on his mix, goes for a more jazzy mix, the highlight of which is an extended piano solo. But the final track, ""Drum and Bass"" mix of ""Secret Place,"" is nothing like today's drum 'n' bass. Instead, it's 100% dub, a spare and lazy day on the islands."
5,great service,"I was very happy with this seller. The product was very good, everything they said it was. And the service was extremely fast compared to others I've dealt with."
2,Copied version of original,Product is ok but could not register with microsoft. Came back as pirated. however it works for very basic stuff.
1,"Never received, No Response from seller","I was very disappointed as I purchased this item hoping to have it with-in the time guaranteed. I didn't receive the item, I tried contacting the seller and I didn't receive any response. I did call Amazon and the customer care person was very courteous and put a claim in to guarantee my purchase. I am not happy with the seller but I was assured by Amazon's commitment."
1,In response to the first reviewer.,"You don't need to be a student or to own your home to get the Home and Student version. Any one can get that version. Microsoft doesn't enforce the student part and by home, they mean where you live."
1,Useful functions now buried under useless functions,"Microsoft essentially took all the useful functions of Word and shuffled them around, while adding some useless functions to distract you (do I really need a blog template?) The new ribbon (it's not even visually attractive) takes all intuition out of navigating through the app. Each command is now a small icon (for all those illiterate Word users) and is variably sized (meaning your eye jerks over each section, instead of down aligned lists). Customization is almost totally left out. Old versions let you customize the toolbars with commands you use most so they're what you need, grouped together to easily find. Now you're limited to one pathetic Quick Access bar. The abbreviated icons / heiroglyphics means it no longer reminds you of shortcut keys (and you have to wade back into that infernal ribbon to find them, meaning they're no longer a shortcut.) I'm all for learning if new & improved, but this yellow-boxed garbage is just counterintuitive."
3,Only supports 1 PC and 1 Laptop per License.,"I called Microsoft to inquire about licensing and sadly, this only comes with a license for a single PC and a single laptop (I'm not sure how they distinguish between the two). However, If you have a home or are a student attending K-12 or University, then you're in luck because you qualify to purchase the Home and Student edition for 1/3 of the price and the ability to install it on 3 computers on a single license sans Outlook."
1,Office 2007 - th worst ever,"I have used every version of Word and Excel since back in DOS.2007 is without any doubt the worst collection of office software that Microsoft has ever made.It is particularly bad for users of previous versions who will tear their hair out trying to accomplish simple tasks that they had mastered long ago.It gets worse. The programmers at Microsoft have severely limited the ability to customize the interface. You loose a lot of real-estate to the ""Ribbon"" and you cannot get it back regardless of whether you use many of the features they decided you need or not."
3,Office 2007 versus 2000,"I didn't want this software, but as Office 2000 was no longer supported, I had to upgrade. Office 2007 is hard to navigate; I can't find much of the items I want; it is not user friendly and I wish I still had 2000. Like Vista, they took a great system and made it harder to use and confusing. Nothing is where it was, so finding what I want is frustrating. Why can't they leave a good system alone?I don't like it at all. 'Nuff said."
4,"Not User Friendly, But What Else is New...","I upgraded to MS Office 2007 because I am a computer hardware and software junkie. Besides that, I like the challenge of solving problems. Office 2007 is one big challenge. Like many others, I don't understand why MS made so many changes in Word, in particular, that make it a nightmare to use for many of us that have been using its predecessors for years and years. The challenge has been much more than I anticipated, but I still would have upgraded knowing what I was getting into."
5,Great savings on quailty product,Great savings when ordering through Amazon. Microsoft Office was new in packaged and worked for what we needed it for. We saved about half compared to where we lived and got all the extras we needed in this version.
5,New User,I know that I give this office 5 stars because I never used the older versions that the other reviewers did. I did have to take the tutorials.I have really enjoyed the office and it has been a great learning experience. Other reviewers that gave the Office low scores were the ones that had the older version. They had a lot of changes and a lot of new things to learn which they did not enjoy.I can say that if you never used any other version of office you will enjoy the 2007 full version.You do have to take the tutorials to get the full benefits of the office.I have been using the office for all most 2 months at the end of August.I would recommend this to my friends if they are interested in putting in the time to learn the software.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the item hoping to update my office system. I opened the product, installed it and then TRIED to use it. It was so totally different from the Office 2003 version that I could NOT figure it out. After several unsuccesful attempts at using the program and lots of cursing, I called Amazon. I returned the product to them and got a partial refund. I lost some money but kept my sanity.I don't know what Microsoft was thinking when they came up with the new format, but for people who use only the basic components of the program, they TOTALLY missed the mark."
1,Hopelessly broken.,"I had high hopes for this release of Office, Microsoft seemed to be making a move towards embracing more open standards and the revamped interface was supposed to be an improvement. Unfortunately, it is anything but. Many ""features"" seem to simply not work. Want to insert images in your document? Be prepared to spend hours manually arranging the page to get a simple in-line image inserted. Want to undo? Better know the ctrl-z shortcut, it seems to have been removed from top level menu options. Remember the standard of File, Edit, etc menus? All gone, replaced by a confusing, difficult to navigate, contextual bar.I could rant for pages. If you need something to type up your grocery list, this is a horribly expensive way to do it, but it can probably handle that. If you need professional word processing capabilities, you'll have to look elsewhere."
1,got a much better deal,"At Amazon you can buy MS Office 2007 Student and Teacher (which includes Word, Excel and Power Point) for $104 and you can also buy MS Outlook 2007 for $79 for a total of $184. Why would anyone buy this product for $324? Microsoft is really silly with all the MS Office versions (not to mention all the MS Windows versions)!"
1,IF you have time to learn a totally new software.....,"you might like this. I don't have that luxury. I need to be able to open the software, do what I want to do, and move on. We purchased the Basic 2007 version on our new machines, and I've already re-installed the Basic 2003 version after 2 weeks of fighting just to print an envelope. How could they mess something up so badly? WHY would they change something so radically that is the basis of so MANY offices out there? If I have to learn a new software, I might as well look around to see if there's some other software I like better."
1,Ripped Off,Had to reload my daughters laptop this week.. only to find out that this copy of Microsoft Office was apparantly an illegal bootleg coy- and Microsoft shut it down.. so now my daughter has no Office software for the first day of school tomorrow.... So not cool!
1,bad choice,"This is not a functioning copy of the software. it was originally distributed for other users and does not have a validation code. therefore, it is not possible for us to get it functional on our computer. i have sent an email to the seller, but have not received a response. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT WITH THIS SELLER!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Microsoft Office Standard 2007 [OLD VERSION],"What I received was OEM System builder Pack ""intended for system builders ONLY"" with a warning that the package did not contain any disc that can be used to install software on a PC.This was not in the product description and was not what I thought I was buying. I bought it on Amazon from a molong99 and have tried to get instructiions on returning it. I went through the email process at Amazon without a response. I then sent a certified letter to the return address on the package, got the green slip back but again, no response. My charge card bill has already been paid so I am out $165.00. STAY AWAY FRON VENDOR MOLONG99 AS THEY HAD NO RETURN INFORMATION POSTED WITH AMAZON. I found out while trying to learn how to return the item, that another person also had the same lack of results with this vendor."
4,Satisfied,"I was satisfied with the product. The only problem is that I am brazilian, the language I installed with my windows is portuguese, and in noplace it was written that, with the the full version, I would not be able to have the menus in the same language that my windows - i do only get them in english"
5,Excellent,This product is excellent. I am thoroughly satisfied with the product and uses it everyday.
2,Microsoft 2007,"When I tried to install the Microsoft 2007 software, it would not install. I called Microsoft and they told me that since I apparently did not have a validation ID included in the package, the program could not be installed. After 15 hours of phone conversations over a period of two days with the Microsoft technicians (in India), they were able to provide me with a working validation ID and install the program. During the process, however, they disabled my security system and firewall for a period of 24 hours. They wanted to know where I purchased the program. I had no telephone number or e-mail address for the seller, only a mailing address. Also, the package was marked ""Military Appreciation Edition."" In addition, most of my defaults were deleted, I still have problems with accessing other programs, and I constantly get error messages on the screen. I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed."
4,works well,i like this new program but be ware that it is a RAM hog and requires a faster processor to work properly
1,Deceitful Seller,The blood item never arrived and the seller never responded to the email. I hope Amazon dump this seller in the river it has named after.
3,MS Office 2007,"It is not stable on Vista. Word often shuts down. Plus you can no longer do ""save as"" from Word. That adds a few more keystrokes for certain duplicative type of Word products."
1,You will re-install Office 2003 within 24 hours of using Office 2007,"Sorry Microsoft, but your ""ribbon"" user interface is the most retarded upgrade feature ever. It renders all your Office applications useless. I have no interest spending hours to learn a completely different UI and to recustomize the toolbar all over again (I'm not even sure if it's even possible to customize the ""ribbon""). The ribbon is ugly and WAY, WAY, WAY, WAY too big.My advice: try to avoid upgrading for as long as possible."
2,Office Suite TK,The software is very good and performance with new computer is excellent; however Microsoft has notified me that the software not valid. I returned software to vendor and looking for a replacement. Not recommended unless valid from Microsoft
2,Product Not What I Ordered,"I did not receive the Microsoft Office Standard 2007 FULL VERSION, what I received was a product that comes with the purchase of a new computer. The product key was not active and the version sent to me was for computer techs who fix computer for others and place software on there system, which leaves the customer no way to place the software on their own system. I was not satisfied and after I tried to contact the vendor, I received no response."
1,Microsoft Office Standard 2007 Full Version,"I purchased this software for my daughter. The Seller listed it at a very low price and I felt it was a Good Deal. She received it in normal delivery time but the software was definitely USED but was advertised as NEW. It was the Wrong software (Office Professional) and it came with two cds which were very scratched. She could not install the software in either of her computers.I have tried to contact the seller, Kevin, without any success. I am just hoping that Amazon will eventually refund my money."
1,Why pay when you can have it for free?,"Microsoft Office has nothing that OpenOffice doesn't have, and OpenOffice is free![...]I'm not associated with OpenOffice in any way, but I do use it exclusively.And I am not a fan of Microsoft, who uses their position to further mislead people. I won't buy, when I can get the same functionality for free.r44chopper"
4,Pricey but have to have it,"When are we going to start the open source office revolution? I'm tired of shelling out $300 per PC so people can have email and such. Anyhow, the software is good and does what it is supposed to do."
2,not what I thought i was buying,"The price was good, but what I received in the mail was not what was pictured on Amazon. The cd case was silver and label ""OEM instatllation for a new pc configuration."" I emailed the company to inquire if I could still use the product and did not receive an answer back. The software is still sitting, unused, as I have not decided to attempt to use it yet."
1,Wasn't even an authentic copy of Microsoft Office.,"I purchased a copy of Microsoft Office 2007 from a 3rd party seller and found it wasn't even an authentic copy of Microsoft Office. I started getting pop up messages from Microsoft that I might not have an authentic version. Upon further investigation, I was able to verify it was indeed not an authentic version. When I contacted the seller and asked if he knew why I would have this problem, he asked no questions, but wanted me to contact him privately. Instead I contacted Amazon who gave me a complete refund after an investigation of their own. Shame on you Kazootie 123 and thank you Amazon."
3,"What does ""full"" mean to you?","This ""FULL"" version does not have Access. I must be dense, but I thought that MS Office was not MS Office without Access. I know, I know, it says what is included, but I was in a hurry and just bought the product based on the header ""FULL VERSION"". Do not buy if you need Access. I guess you will need the ""FULLER"" version if you want Access. But, bottom line, it is MS Office (less than full) and works with my windows laptop without a hitch. Stay with PC and stay with Windows, you won't be disappointed. Also this upgrade of Office takes some getting used to if you have used the earlier versions. I don't know why Gates can't leave a good thing alone and just upgrade when necessary."
4,Quality Product,"The product came in a timely manner. It was exactly as described, and works very well. Good value for the money."
1,this books sucks!,"Big time waste of money. Pix are bland, boring, old, and most of them are small. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this log to add to the fire! Good for....propping up your loose table leg."
1,The Boring Revelation,"I was anxious to get this book. However, I didn't find any new or interesting insights into the meaning of John's Revelation. It was pretty much just constantly dismissive of everything John wrote.John was just using a figure of speech here and didn't mean anything by it.John didn't write this passage so pay no attention to it.John was just being symbolic and didn't mean anything by it.John is happy that you are trying to correct the negativity of his imagery.By reading the previous few phrases you have pretty much read her book. If an angel of celestial order did help write this book then that angel doesn't seem to know very much. Bottom line is it seemed to be another book of new age channeled nonsense without substance and designed to appeal to those scared about the future as described in prophecies, which are all very similar, from around the world's various scriptures and cultures."
4,Awesome Fingerplays,These seasonal fingerplays are great. My favorite two are about rabbits. When my children are playing with playdough I get out the rabbit cookie cutter and quote two of the fingerplays from this book. One is called A rabbit in the meadow on a sunny day and the other one is called I looked across the meadow and what did I see. There is also a spring fingerplay about umbrellas and rain. I would like to send home a copy of this fingerplay with a small cut out umbrella for each child. I feel that this helps them to learn the fingerplay by heart. Another fingerplay from this book is called A cute little duck stepped out of the lake. I have a stuffed duck that I show to the children when teaching this fingerplay. This is also a great book. Thank you!
2,bandit,"this item is not as pictured... the back is very low and hits your head at the top of the neck. this is very uncomfortable and I would not recommend it to anyone taller than 5 ft. The bar at the bottom of your back hits the tail bone and is also very uncomfortable. I wish I could return it for a refund, but it has already been assembled and in the water. That was the only way to know how comfortable it would be."
4,Poolmaster: Not what it use to be. Quality wise......,"As with ALL Chinese made products, this lounge chair is not the quality of when it was made in the U.S.A. Buyer Beware !!!"
4,Great Single,"Great singles for only having two songs, the edited rock version of the Benjamins, and the LP version of Been Around the World. I am not exactly the biggest fan of Puffy, but the single is Cheap and a good buy for anyone. The cover even looks pretty good. Enjoy it!"
1,Terrible,"Yeah, I know this song is almost 13 years old, but I came across it the other night for the first time in years. I was so repulsed that it moved me to officially vent. I hated it then, and I still hate it.These guys (especially Fluff Daddy) are a big part of the reason that music has gone down so much in quality. They take someone else's music and then mumble on top of it and think they are artists. Seriously, these guys talk like their mouths are filled with marbles or marshmallows. Just when you think it can't get any worse, The Notorious P.I.G. chimes in to say, ""I've got even more marshmallows in my mouth and I can still rap!"" Well, you won the round of Chubby Bunny, guys, but we all lose."
1,Awful,"If you really enjoy fish and admire their beauty, admire them in a more suitable environment. Fish might not make noise and complain but they have physical sensation and they have needs. You wouldn't keep a puppy locked in an unventilated cage with all of its waste, so why would you keep any other living, feeling creature in similar conditions with no filter, no heater, and such a small amount of water that the constant chemical changes cause it stress, illness, and ammonia burns? Bettas can deal in pretty harsh conditions. That does not mean they should have to. Before you buy this product or any kind of bare minimum fish bowl for your goldfish, guppy, or betta, remember that you are assuming responsibility for a real PET, not just a cute decoration on your wall or end table."
2,Hoping for another great Smiley Novel,"After reading ""Horse Heaven"" and loving every minute, I have been anxiously awaiting Ms. Smiley's newest novel. It never grabbed me, nothing terribly interesting or exciting happened, and the big con played on our likeable main character wasn't so very awful. It was basically blah and I was disappointed. If you really want to read this book, don't buy it! Get it from the library or borrow from a friend who has already spent their money on it! Sorry Jane, looking forward to the next one."
2,No smiles from Smiley,"I bought this book based on an enthusiastic review in the Wall Street Journal, a paper I trust, and because I had heard of Smiley's previous well known works. But Good Faith was a huge disappointment. It dragged along for literally hundreds of pages before she brought us to the true dramatic crisis; what led up to that crisis was B-O-R-I-N-G. Even when we finally get to the ""crisis,"" it seems like no big deal, and is resolved undramatically and quickly. The main character, Joe, also has little depth and spends no time contemplating the morality (or lack thereof) of his affair with a married woman. This book only deserves two stars because Smiley's writing ( as opposed to story-telling) is so good. I may try ""Moo,"" but I'll get it from the library this time."
2,Booooorrring,I really did not like this book. I was going to say I hated it but actually the writing wasn't bad and I liked some parts but it went on way too long and it was pretty predictable. I read it through just because I was sure the ending would not be what I expected - but it was. What a disappointment.
1,You can't make Realtors exciting,"Wow, a story about Realtors, developers, and Accountants and it is dull. Who would have guessed! Even the sex is dull! The book makes the S & L crisis dull. This a a turgid book with uninteresting characters plodding through. When you reach the end it is ""so what."" Plot summary: Boy meets Con man developer, boy gets greedy, boy gets burned, things go back to normal when boy realized greed isn't good. There were interesting pieces of characters. The most interesting one seems to be Joe's former girlfriend Sally. The fact that the most interesting character is dead at the beginning of the book should tell you how interesting the book is."
2,good faith - not enough to go on,"What a disappointment! Smiley's newest work is not only mundane and uninteresting, her usual wonderful writing is absent so there is nothing in this book to get hooked on. The novel follows the prosaic life of a prosaic man, with little insight or tension to keep the reader interested in what might happen. It seemed as if Smiley herself was not very interested in her protagonist's life, leaving little to recommend in this book. Try her earlier books which have some life and spark, and brilliant writing."
2,"too much, too little","Too much graphic sex, predictable ending, and disappointing treatment of what could have been an enjoyable novel on the greedy 80's."
1,Bland and Boring,"This book is so tedious, filled with pages and pages of boring superfluous details, that it is hard to get through. The promise of a great ending never materializes.Save your time and read a good financial thriller by Stephen Frey instead."
1,Most BORING book ever,I decided to read this book because of Jane Smiley's reputation. After an entire book of weakly drawn characters and a plot that is so transparent I wanted to scream - absolutely nothing of any significance happens. I kept reading because of her reputation. I wish I hadn't wasted my time on what I would consider one of the most BORING books ever written. Some of my children's beginning chapter books are more interesting.
5,Under-appreciated author,I've read several of her books. All are different and all are very good. Her characters are extremely well drawn and believable. The plot moves along and is interesting. I think that she is one the best authors writing today. I especailly liked this book.
2,"Meandering, unrewarding, predictable","There's not a surprise or twist to be had in this slow novel about uninteresting people. A real estate scam as obvious as it is mundane, and a passive main character = a terrible read and waste of time."
1,Disappointed,"After reading this book, I admit I felt empty. After building up characters and relationships, Smiley seemed like she got ""end of the book"" fatigue, and tied things up too quickly. I felt that the main character, Joe, was flat and just a little bit stupid. I'm sure the reader saw where this was going, but he sure didn't. The ending seemed contrived and didn't really make up for the crimes committed. Marcus' and Jane's motivation was unclear. By the time the very long book was over, I didn't care what happened to any of the characters."
3,More potential than heft,"Joe is a comfortably fixed low-achiever of a real estate agent in a small NJ/NY/PA town that's beautiful and off the beaten track. His marriage has broken up, and he's just getting along being a good only son to his religious parents and surrogate son to the parents of an old girlfriend who was killed many years ago. It's the early 80s and the reader knows the savings and loan crisis is looming and a real estate bust, but poor Joe does not.Into town rides a con man who pretty much takes everyone for a ride -- leaving Joe all but penniless. It's a little more complicated than that -- whether the con man started out as a con man or started out more or less honest, then got sucked in is never entirely clear. Joe has a couple of girlfriends along the way, but ends up single as he began.It's a book with more potential than heft. Smiley wanted to write about greed and land and betrayal, but in the end didn't have much that was original to say."
5,excellent story,"I listen to the audiobook. The story is a great for mixed adult male/female audience as it identifies with work, buying a house, not too romantic, but inticing with its high stakes property investment. Joe is in ordinary guy who is humble but grew up by white collar people and has a modest real estate job. Good Faith tells the story of the eventual whirlwind of Joe's life after he comes into contact with Marcus Burns. Marcus Burns with his air of know-it-all attitude takes Joe on ride of persuasion. The pursuit of money, pride, 1980s arrogance and confidence of real estate development intersect in this great book."
3,An decent addition to your sci-fi collection,"Having read several of the previous Nebula Awards compendiums, I expected nothing less than 350 pages of excellent sci-fi. While many of the pieces in this book were excellent (Silverberg's comes to mind) some of the essays also seemed somewhat pendantic and overly emphasized in the volume (it seemed that there were as many essays as short stories). If you haven't read a Nebula Awards book before, I suggest buying a previous volume. Even so, #32 was good enough to merit me purchasing it after borrowing it from a friend."
4,Onenote and freestyle note-taking,If you are accustomed to taking notes by hand this program is a easy transition to word processed notes that still allows for freestyle note-taking. The organizing features are excellent and the program allows you to search your notes for keywords.
5,Nice Rock Solid Bench Block,I got this bench block to do some minor gunsmithing work and it works like a charm. You get a nice solid heavy chunk of metal and it seems to be of good quality. I've been banging away on this thing and it does the job. No issues no complaints. For 17 bucks you really can't go wrong.
2,Disappointed,"Not sure what I expected, but the suggested questions did not add much to what seems to already be common sense."
1,NOT a conversation starter.,I am now suspicious of so many positive reviews. The questions in the book are good for someone you already know. If you are trying to break the ice with someone new FORGET IT !
5,And they lived Happily Ever After....,My friend invited me home one weekend to meet his family and hang out. It was a 3 hour car drive and I was really nervous about what we were going to do to fill the time. I had this book but hadn't really opened it yet so I thought I'd bring it along. It was a GREAT conversation starter and really helped up open up and get to know each other! We began dating the day we came back form the trip and are now married! It was a great book and we have since recommended it to anyone and everyone.
2,"Yes, 1001 Questions But They May Stop Conversations","Most of these questions, posed to a stranger, would leave you talking to yourself unless you were in an episode of The Big Bang Theory.This certainly has a lot of questions, but whether they have any value as conversation starters, the other reviewers' comments notwithstanding, is suspect. I have a tough time imagining asking someone with whom I need a conversation starter (548) ""What does this quote mean? 'He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep, to gain what he cannot lose.' (Jim Elliot)"" Or, (242) ""When you fly, do you prefer to arrive at the airport extra early or get there just in the nick of time? Why?"" (852) ""What determines how much trust you will place in a spiritual authority?""If you want to use this with a friend, then maybe there's value but who has trouble conversing with a friend?"
4,Good Choice !,This is a great book for just about any type of gathering. The questions are provocative and entertaining.
5,great... recommend,It was a great buy.it was perfect condition. Very interesting book. Cheap and it will interest anyone from all ages. I would not think twice if i were you. Great
3,Not really cocktail party talk,"It really IS a complete list of conversation starters, but most are not ones one would use at a cocktail party. Many are excellent for engaged couples or other relationships where deeper intimacy is desired. I guess the name is correct that it covers all kinds of occasions, but they certainly aren't questions one could use at ""any"" occasion! The more intimate ones probably should be required of any couple who are getting serious!"
4,"interesting book, good service","good for getting to know people, getting your own brain thinming ,always a good thing right!"
1,"I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV","This book is just what I would expect from a movie and TV personality... not very intelligent at all. It tries too hard and takes itself way too seriously. Kim Cattrall seems like a somewhat intelligent woman, but why did she think that playing a sexually liberated woman like Samantha on ""Sex and the City"" made her an expert in sexuality? Ms. Cattrall does not reveal anything new about human nature in this book. There are no revelations here... just a pretty coffee book with endless cliches. Did you guys know that bio-chemistry had alot to do with human sexuality? IMAGINE THAT! and, I bet you did not know that your BRAIN is the most inportant sexual organ. Gosh darn it, I guess I better start using mine! If you are really interested in sexuality (and you should, because it is an important aspect of human nature), there are much more intelligent books than this. Don't go for this Hollywood/HBO slick job."
2,"Great cover, but the content nothing than average cultured person does not know","I somehow knew when I bought it that I was falling into a marketing trick. The title is extremely misleading as it hardly develops the concept of what is ""sexual intelligence"". Ms Cattrall basically states that our sexual emotions, feelings and perceptions are guided by the mind, which is kind of obvious, but any original conclusion or insight is absent from the text. That aside, the book is read in 1 hour and it feels like talking with a friend about this topic, and even if no new ideas are developed during the conversation, is fun to have it anyway. After all we are talking about sex."
5,Beautiful book--inside and out!,"I add my voice of praise to the other reviewers already before me. Lynn Morrissey's gorgeous book, ""Love Letters to God"" is beautiful inside and out. Lynn's background includes music, which is evident as one reads her lyrical, poetic heart-prayers to God. Her words simply sing. So does the exquisite art work by the gifted Katia Andreeva. The combination of these two talented women was definitely heaven-sent. This book touched and challenged me (but not in a guilty 'you must!' way) to go deeper and richer in my prayer life with God--through the written word. How inspired! This beautiful book will inspire you and your friends as well to do the same. A perfect gift for Easter, Mother's Day, or birthdays. I highly recommend it."
5,"Speaker, author and media personality","Lynn Morrissey has a beautifully poetic way of writing, in a deeply personal manner with candor and humility that draws the reader into an intimacy with her, while revealing the kind of relationship we can all have with God, through faith in Jesus Christ. ""Love Letters to God"" evokes every tender emotion, bringing the reader to examine his or her own life, heart and prayer-life. Simply gorgeous to look at, inspiring to mediate upon and a book to be cherished always."
5,Such Beauty!,"I was amazed when I opened up the pages of LOVE LETTERS TO GOD and found such beauty--beauty in the heart-touching depth of the writing and beauty in the amazing artwork that graces each page. The book is like a sweet, magnificently crafted invitation to draw closer to our Heavenly Father. It doesn't get any sweeter!"
3,"Nice, but bulky to handle","It fits and works nicely for my 2005 4Runner, however instead of folding up into segments this one requires rolling it up and then fastening the velcro strap around it. So if someone is sitting in the passenger seat I have to take it out of the car to roll it up to store."
1,600mAh,"This battery (by ""Wireless Technologies"") is a cheap 600 mAh battery made in China with (likely) no independent tests of its safety. If you search Google you can find a 1000 mAh E635 battery or the original and safe 800 mAh."
5,Love It!!!!!,Love It!!!!! It's perfect for frying. No mess and easy to clean. I would highly recommend this fryer. This is the second one we have purchased.
5,A devided Big Daddy!,What a great idea. It works well and it solves the problem of how to deep fry two items at one time. Thanks!
4,Reliable product.,"We bought this deep fryer around 3 years ago and it is still working great! We received a fancier deep fryer for a gift, but the fancy one never seems to get hot enough. This deep fryer has never given us any problems."
1,Not worth the money because it doesn't work,"I got the Presto Dual Daddy and it is the worst fryer that I have ever had. It doesn't have a temperature control and it heats the oil to almost 450 degrees, so everything was burnt and undercooked. When I got into contact with the company they where very rude to me and admited that they where aware of the problem but did nothing to fix it. I have a few fryers in the past and this one was a waste of money."
4,Perfect,"Just what I wanted, heats up fast and great to store away when not in use and the price was great."
3,Good fryer but no temparature adjustments,This is a very good fryer and used it about 5 times during thanksgiving and only thing that I didn't like about this the temperature could not be controlled and the oil starts smoking quickly.
4,Presto is the way to go in fryers,"I bought this fryer after wearing out my old one just like it.The only con I have against this product is the way the power cordconnects to the fryer. I say this because it falls off the fryer.And if you dont notice, your meal will be late because you have toput the magnetic plug back on the fryer and let it heat up again."
5,Awesome,"Tough and works great. I like the protective container it came in and the detailed instructions. I'm not sure the alcohol scale math is accurate but that works out for the better, my wine had to be stronger than what the math told me."
4,Good Value,"Although the glass work on this hydrometer is a little and delicate, if handled carefully, that shouldn't be a problem. It works as expected. The seller shipped timely, but did not provide tracking."
5,Simple is better,"After clumsily breaking my more expensive/complicated hydrometer, I purchased this one. It is simple, no-nonsense, easy to read and nicely affordable. When I clumsily break it, I'll replace it with this same product."
5,Nice hydrometer for a small price,"Item was as described and arrived quickly. The case is a bit small to take a hydrometer reading, but otherwise it works well."
2,It works.,I am kind of disappointed. I didn't expect a whole lot for four bucks but this thing is pretty low quality. The gauge is just a piece of paper wrapped around the core and glued closed. On the bottom of mine the glue didn't adhere correctly and it is coming apart. It doesn't really affect the ability to measure but it is annoying.
2,Good tool but...,Get the Hydrometer with a built in thermometer and save yourself another hassle of finding the temperature of the wort/beer.
5,High quality,"Hydrometer arrived in great shape and works well. Now I know for sure when a batch of beer is ready to bottle!Also, for those that complain about the ""testing container"" that it comes in being too small... That tube is just the packaging. You are supposed to buy a ""HYDROMETER TEST JAR"" to test in. Or buy a more expensive hydrometer that comes with one :}"
5,Nice very nice,This is another great deal on a very high quality product I actually saw the same hydrometer for 3 times the price once again another great deal on amazon.
3,"Works well, but VERY fragile.","This hydrometer produced results consistent with what was expected, but it is extremely fragile. I would rather pay a little extra and use one with thicker glass (obviously they amount of weight in the bottom would have to be reduced). I broke mine picking it up out of the sanitizer. I didn't hit it on anything, bend it, or grip it hard. I picked it up and the top cracked off.I found the instructions to be somewhat lacking, perhaps if you have been using hydrometers for awhile, you won't need them anyway. That said, it took no time at all to find everything I needed to know online.Will I buy another? Maybe? They are inexpensive, so that's a plus. I will probably look around to see if I can find something that is a little better quality without being too much more expensive. If you do get one of these, just be careful."
4,Hydrometer,"This device is inexpensive, yet does the job. I have no complaints. They are fragile. I have dropped and broken one, but at this price I don't worry too much."
3,Wrong for what I needed,"Product probably great for home brewing but not for what I needed it for. The images were too small online - but for the price I ordered it thinking that being a triple scale hydrometer, it would have the scale I needed, but it didn't. Fast shipping but I needed hydrometer for measuring the volume of peroxide."
2,Not the Best Book I found,I got a few books to get ready for the LAST. This book is a book of tests without any real reading or writing review or examples of essays. The LAST is a reading and writing test and a good reading and writing review should be there. The LAST tests in the book were not like the LAST I took which had many more long readings and some long readings had just one question. After the test many people I talked to did not feel that good about the test and a lot of them said that they could have used more time so do not worry if you feel that way. Some people did not leave enough time to do both the reading test and the essay. I heard you just have to get near to 70% correct do well on the reading test. Good luck on the test. I am pretty sure I will pass but this book did not help me improve my score.
1,Just a Back Up,This book is just a back up for the Barrons book. Do not use it for your main preparation. I was very disappointed and you probably do not need it at all.
3,Helped me pass the ATSW the first time,I used this study guide (and this one only) for the ATSW and I passed it the first time. It was a good representation of the questions asked on the test and the explanation of all the possible answers in the sample questions was very helpful.
4,Excellent resource,"Has a variety of explorer activities to keep students working on the idea of past explorers. I like having these activities, but have to find the resources for each explorer listed myself. Would have been great to have a page about each explorer for students to use a s a resource."
5,Great Item,"I bought this item for my 2000 VW Beetle 2.0L. It was the exact fit as the original, even the connectors fitted perfectly like an OEM part. Overall quality was good at half the cost for an original. It was a great purchase and I definitely recommend this item if you're looking to save some money."
5,My car is always clean!,"I bought this for my husband and he loves it. He keeps it in the trunk and I have to say my car is always sparkling clean. It has good stuff for your money. The way my car looks, its worth every penny!"
1,A hideous betrayal,"I feel that the author had an intriguing premise in cloning Jesus. However, the tangent it ended on was to me a betrayal of the promise of the book. It assumed that the only ability of a Jesus clone was ""miracles"" and gave little substantiation for the popularity of Father Peter. I also felt that there were a multitude of loose ends and extraneous baggage to the story. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK and am destroying my copy."
4,Compelling story,"The novel is darkish but has a very compelling story line. I read both the English and the German version and found the latter one full of blunders and translation mistakes. However, in English it is really fun to read. The concept of cloning things past -- aptly coming up two years after Michael Crichton's ""Jurassic Park"" -- does not leave the impression that Monteleone simply rehashed Crichton's idea: It has entirely different consequences when applied to the blood of Jesus. Light fiction or not: This book gets my recommendation -- and I ask the admonitory question to Amazon: Why the hell is this book not available for Kindle?"
3,blood of the lamb,"This is an interesting book with a controversal subject. It does contain many errors in facts that it uses as part of the story line, so the author should do better research ie: southern Indiana is as flat as a pool ( it actually is rolling hills, Northern Indiana is flat). May be controversal to those who are religious for it does show some of the not so pleasant sides of many types of Christian religions. Borders on medical science fiction for a basis to the story. Easy reading, not really scary, but controversal subject."
4,A nice little tale about falling in love.,"Beyond the black and white, this is a quiet, absorbing tale about 2 people who meet and fall in love. The excitement of first contact is eventually transformed into the boredom of familiarity. The characters have to dig down really deep into their souls- each has to decide for themselves if the relationship is worth saving. And in a sense perhaps they can then figure out what true love may be all about. Love as intangible as it might be, is the real star of this movie."
5,Spectacular!,"If you are like me and think that indie movies are not your thing then, this is the movie that will convince you to think otherwise. Once again, this is Tambay Obenson at his finest. The two main characters-Gabe and Schola show such raw emotion that any viewer of this movie is bound to stay to the end of the movie and afterwards REALLY question the reality of ones' own relationships. For you guys out there, this is NOT a girlie movie but for you gals, it seems like it is."
1,terrible,"This movie has to be one of the most painfully pretentious pieces of pseudo art I've ever had the dis-pleasure of wasting my time watching.The acting is atrocious across the board. It's painful to watch, really.If you read the reviews here, you get the sinking feeling that they were all written by participants of this ""piece of art"".Check it out: One of them was even written by director Tambay A. Obenson under his own Amazon account.It almost would make you feel sorry, a grown man feeling the need to hype up his own failed work by writing a review about hi own movie... well he's a self declared film critic after all and writes for a bunch of blogs... how comes everybody writing for a blog is a journalist these days?There are so many brilliant independent movies out there and even the lesser ones are still more rewarding to watch than this failed attempt at artistic film making."
3,Good job Tambay!,"Hopes, dreams and love are one's desires, yet pose life's struggles. Centering on two characters- Scola, an aspiring actress and Gabe, an aspiring film maker, the film portrays the two as free spirited individuals in the beginning and takes on the search for meaning when one encounters the other and develops a relationship. In the end, they fall into the point of self evaluating or defining one's desires or redirecting from original desires. The struggle is inherent- reality versus the dream. The color scenes are a bit too raw, but ask the questions of life or what's next? It is the poetic black and white imagery in BEAUTIFUL THINGS that are the more powerful accounts, capturing moments of original desires."
3,no,"I didn't like this book, it had no plot. I wish I didn't read it. You can if you want......mabey you will have a fun time. I am only 7 years old so i have no true taste."
4,An English Language grammar for french speakers !,"The preface states : this grammar is adressed to University students and students of Grandes Ecoles or equivalent to Ivy League University students in North America from the beginning of their studies up to exams and competitions of all levels.Goals of this textbook :help the student assimilate and utilize the structures of today's english spoken and written without affectation or vulgarity by educated Anglophones ( Brits and Americans) .Some characteristics : emphasis on levels of language( written, familiar, very formal , etc), importance given to verbs , nouns and adjectives construction, american idioms, eight lessons on certain abstract notions such as how to express purpose, preference, incertitude, constrast.It comes with exercises and the answers to the exercises."
1,Don't waste your money,"There are lots of things wrong with this phone but the two that stick out in my mind are 1) the phone never holds a charge. I am constantly loosing calls due to a dieing battery and 2)(this may sound strange) this phone does not feel good when held to your ear. Most phones I have had in the past are ergonomic if you will, this one is not. I can only talk for a few minutes before I am ready to switch to another phone."
5,Helpful for stressed lawyers,"Lawyers need all the help that's available. This book is a strong step in the right direction. The many helpful areas included how to both avoid and deal with stressful situations. It was easy to read and contained valuable stress lowering and self esteem raising techniques.Wayne D. Ford, Ph.D., author of ""The Attorney's Guide to Stress Management"" docwifford@msn.com"
4,Useful but a little expensive,"I purchased this to get my monitor's build-in USB hub connected to my computer and ran this around the video cable to the case. Great product, does as expected and soft enough plastic to allow flexibility in wrapping and still remain out of the way.I would think as a stretch usb cable there would be too much tension - a regular straight usb cable would be better."
5,Funny Funny Funny,I caught parts of this on either Showtime or HBO and laughed my head off.. my dog thought I was having seizures - haha! The ostrich and the carolers story with demonstration - worth price of admission.. I will be buying this and sharing with everyone I know...
3,Not great material,Bryan Callen is a very funny comedian and capable of much better than this. There are some laughs but the set doesn't flow and gets side-tracked by physical gags. Worth watching if you are a fan but probably won't convince you to buy his next special if you are not.
2,Looks better than it performs,"The fountain unit is good but the hose was too thin and fittings too weak to run off the pool cleaner outlet I had to buy a thicker hose and hose clamps. The pool cleaner adaptor is just barely large enough, with loads of Teflon tape otherwise it just blows off when turned on.Once I got the unit to work using the pool cleaner pump, it did lower the pool temp 10 degrees, which in Texas, makes the pool temperature very comfortable. The unit is not an easy install however."
1,Don't buy,Clamps were plastic and of very poor quality. The hose leaked immediately after one use. Can't take the pressure needed to make a decent fountain.
2,Poolmaster 54510 Grecian Floating Pool Fountain,"So DISAPPOINTED!! I ordered the fountain it worked for 5 minutes and then the hose popped. My husband tried to patch the hole and nothing worked, he even put a new hose on it and that popped too. I want a full refund."
3,Pool Fountain,"This pool fountain was a replacement for one that I had previously. It was easy to assemble and worked well, however the tubing was a little cheaply made and ripped. Luckily the tubing was quite long, so I could cut it, and had enough for it to work."
3,Good for Kindle,"I sampled three popular law dictionaries for Kindle (1)Law Dictionary, (Mass Market) 6th Ed. (Barron's Legal Guides), (2)Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law, and (3)Nolo's Plain-English Law Dictionary. By far, the best I'd seen is Barron's. Among other things, instant search is enabled, and there are hotlinks to related terms. Webster's is next (e.g it's got hotlinks, but shows only one definition per page). Nolo is the worst; it's like all they did was convert the text. Try before you buy."
5,Merriam Webster law dictionary,This dictionary is more concise and easy to understand for a beginning law student. Black's seem to assume you already know everything and does not cover some of the simple terms I look for. I'm sure a complete edition of Blacks would be great i just don't have that yet.
4,Good Dictionary,"A very good dictionary. The only drawback is that it is not very comprehensive. It does not include all the terms you expect to find in your daily activities, but still a good option to have around."
2,Less Helpful Than a Regular Dictionary,"The first thing I noticed about this dictionary was that the format was a little strange. It was not as clear and straight-forward as I would have liked. Secondly, it actually does not have a lot of the words I needed. I used it the first day and now I have gone back to my free Dictionary App or online Legal Dictionaries."
4,Decent mascara,"This is a good mascara but I prefer Maybelline's Colossal Volume mascara. I liked the idea of the two layers, but I don't think it makes a huge difference and just adds some extra time to my make application. I do think it helps with the curl but not enough to make me want to buy it again. Definitely not a bad mascara but I'm going to stick with Colossal Volume, which gives me more volume and length in my opinion."
5,AS GOOD AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN,I DO NOT KNOW WHY THIS IS NO LONGER SOLD IN STORES. PROVIDES A PERFECT FOUNDATION FOR APPLYING ANY MASCARA.
2,Outdated,"Product was dry and flaky. Outdated. Maybelline had a great product in this mascara, it is a shame they have discontinued it."
3,Nation State,"this album is good, the beats are a little repetitive but the overall mix proves to be a good dance set, even with it being so short. if you like the hard-core underground acid sound, then this album is definately for you. i especially like the way acucrack jumps from a prog. house beat to breakbeat then to jungle. i just wish the songs were mixed together, oh well."
2,"Good for a tunnel, but not much more.","When it's positioned in your layout, it makes a bright, orange underpass, but using it for it's intended purpose is a bit troublesome. The little gray cement barrels don't always fall down when you press the top, and it gets my kids frustrated that they have to bang it several times. Also, unless you position the cement truck in just the right minute position, you are not going to get the cement piece into the back of it, as it's an extremely fine fit. The gate arm is the same used on the toll booth bridge, and it's horrible. Most of the time, it doesn't work, and the rest of the time, you have to use extreme pressure with your finger (hard even for an adult) to get it to work. Forget about your kids having enough strength to press it. The 2 little cement barrels are pretty small, and bound to get lost, then this thing serves no purpose. But, like I said, it looks nice as a big, orange tunnel!"
2,Book?,After three and a half months I am still waiting for the product .... when will I get the book?
4,Lesson Plan,"A good reference for making lesson plans. Read it slowly, you might get bored with its pure print. If you are a new teacher, this booklet can guide you."
2,False Advertising,"The gum is fine. However, the image shows that the packs of gum are the old, original packs when in fact they are the new packs that have the flap that never keeps the packs closed. Single pieces of gum are always finding their way out of these new packs. I thought I found the old packaging based on the image."
1,Solo un hit,"A pesar de la importancia del tema ""Copacabana"" en la carrera de Lissette,es esta realmente la unica cancion de importancia en este disco. Resalta un poco el tema ""Si hay amor Volvera"" de la autoria de la artista. El resto de los temas como ""El Cochecito"" y ""Si Senor como no"" suenan aninados y anodinos,muy lejos de los grandes temas de gran fuerza a los que Lissette nos tiene acostumbrados. Si te interesa por el hit realmente no vale la pena,pues hay una version muy superior (aunque mas corta) del tema en su disco ""En Vivo"". Menos que regular"
2,Pretty Good !,"The CD-ROM is not designed to fill your whole monitor screen which is kind of upsetting,and there are videos that you cant hear at all.Other than that it'll serve its purpose.Buy it,and you will see what im talking about.!Goodluck!"
4,Works well,"This review book was pretty thorough, I used it more than the saunders. THe saunders questions are easier to understand than these, but other than that it is a good book and cdrom"
4,excellent,I thought this was a great resource when studying. it was a great review of info and there were a ton of questions to go through. there is also a cd to use in your computer with questions. i thought this was well worth the price i paid.
1,seller sucks!,seller sucks! i've been waiting for my book for almost a month now and i received no information about it being canceled. i had to contact amaazon for them to tell me that it was canceled because they no longer have the book! so basically the seller just left me hanging while im over here waiting. Im a full time nursing student. This is bullcrap and so is the seller! i would no suggest buying from the person.
5,Excellent Decal,"The sticker wasn't the easiest to put on, but I think some of that was user error. The sticker is large and very noticable. I am trying to represent ""Made in Michigan"" and have had many compliments on the decal. I would suggest a little more sturdy of a packaging for the mail, but I love it."
2,Not overly pleased.,"Shipping was fast. The item would be acceptable...IF..#1) It was in fact WinCraft..but appears home-made. Which is ok, but not what I thought I was buying. It is not as pictured!!! #2) NOT 8x8..the stock its printed on isn't even 8x8. Though the size would be ok, IF... #3) My husband who has placed numerous of these types of things, could not get it to stick. I bought two. So, I flushed $17. I am not a happy camper. If we could get them to stick, and stay stuck I would be happy."
1,Horrifically Bad,"It is difficult to review this book given the large number of blank/missing pages it contains. In the version that I received, 28 pages are blank (randomly distributed thoughtout the chapters). This book has extraordinarily low production values - it is essentially unreadable. I emailed Amazon (the seller) about the problem and received no response."
5,perfect,"This book is just perfect.In the first part of the book the puzzles are introduced with some words that can give you an idea of what's going on. I usually don't like these kind of things, but ok, this is ""Learn Chess Tactics"", not ""Test your tactic level"" or something like that.All the puzzles are from recent games, all the solutions are correct, every solution is analyzed in depth."
2,Hard to follow,I learned from this book but there is only one diagram per example so it is hard to follow the play that is spelled out only in chess notation. You have to set up the examples on a table to see how the many moves listed end up in showing the tactic being explained by the book. The book should of had many more diagrams with the moves indicated.
3,"Tactics are Crucial, But...","Tactics are absolutely crucial (and Nunn does a superb job as always), but... you need more than that in order to move past your mental blocks in chess. You might want to check outChess Brain 2.0 : New Neural Techniques for Rapid Chess Improvement"
4,Try a little tenderness,"Brook Benton certainly tried his hand at tenderness, perhaps never more so than on this coupling of two original mid-sixties LPs. His soothing, rich baritone caresses the lyrics of the songs, which find him accompanied by Glenn Osser's string laden band on That Old Feeling and a more sparse, but vastly more interesting, orchestra compiled and arranged by Anita Kerr on My Country. That band consists of a tiny string section, rhythm + vibraphone and a couple of french horns, which are used to great effect by Ms Kerr. Also we get a chance to hear her peerless close-harmony singers in sympathetic rapport with Benton. If you're in the mood for soft lights and sweet music you'd be well advised to put this CD in your player. Don't turn up the volume though, or you will hear some extraneous and slightly irritating noises on some titles, reason enough to withhold one star. Otherwise a most enjoyable collection of one of the forgotten greats of crooning."
3,salt in his shoes,It was about a boy named micheal almost gave up his dream of playing basketball.because he thouth he was to short to play. his mother told him if you put salt in your shoes he would gettaller than he TO PRAY every day. he did not go back to the park for
5,Grandson Books,"Bought the book for my grandson and he loves the books, this one is his favorite. The books came sooner than expected and in the condition it stated."
