2,"OK, but not my cup of tea","This book was recommended by a friend. Enthusiasts of fantasy novels may enjoy it, as it is readable. The author's inversion of London had some appeal, and he knows his city well. Ultimately, this novel failed for me. It read too much like an extended version of a good D&D game and not enough as a piece of literature, at least for my taste."
2,Not my cup of tea,Book was suggested for our book club. Not my cup of tea. Too many people and places. Gets very confusing.
3,Strangely Addictive,"I have been anticipating reading this book for quite a while and had finally gotten around to buying and reading it. I went in thinking that this was going to be an awesome adventure, which, it was. But, I am used to American authors and they way their books flow. Gaiman being a British author writes in a stop-flow kind of manner. The two main villains in the story are hard to understand and needed a dictionary to figure out a lot of the words they were saying.This story is strangely addictive because of how out-there it is in the London Below.Enjoy either way. : )"
1,"I tried, I really tried.","I realllllly tried to complete this book with enthusiasm to read it, but I found that it was an inner personal chore to complete at least 2 pages of this book (kindle version). Neil Gaiman is my favorite author this month after reading American Gods and Anansi Boys, but this...this story does not do anything for me. It came to the point where I had to return it because the story infact goes NOWHERE as mentioned in a previous review. Maybe it was because this was an early story of Gaiman, but I'm definitely glad that he has stories much much better than this in present day."
2,A tired plot badly written.,"Take Douglas Adams and Clive Barker, put them in a blender on low speed and sieve the remaining sludge through a filter which extracts talent and originality - and you have ""Neverwhere."" Reading this book reminded me how glad I was that I had long past burned the fiction I had produced in high school. I gave this book 2 stars rather than the signle one I was tempted due to the one sentence gems of literary promise which emerged from the muck every three pages or so. There is scattered evidence that Gaiman can write, however he has a lot of work ahead of him if he wishes to produce a novel worthy of the paper it's printed on. The amount of people giving this book five stars is frightening, and I suspect these readers need the same type of exposure to well honed literature (the kind without pictures) as Gaiman himself."
2,Abridged? How about massacred!,"I immediately fell in love with this book when I picked it up two years ago. That is why I was so disenchanted with this auditape version. I thought it suspicious that it was only two hours but though what the hay. My suspicions proved right, this ""shortened"" version is a masacre and leaves the characters flat. Skip the audio version of this one and go straight for the print - you won't be sorry."
3,Meh,"The writing was good, but I never felt very connected to the characters. The whole story seemed rather rushed. The premise was interesting, but I never felt fully engaged in the world the writer had created."
2,Flat.,"I had such high hopes for Neil. Sandman is great, I love his girlfriends music, and my favourite modern author holds him in such high esteem. And then.... That's it. Neverwhere is just a deflated random mess. It is at best a diverting read, but at this point the premise has been done so many times, and better, that the book is not recommendable. It's..Tales of the Nightside, but not that good. Actually if he had kept it to a Nightside length he might have been okay. The characters are cutouts, the premise shaky, dialogue cliche', and descriptions vague and unimaginative. If he wants to do a sequel, which was left wide open, I might give him a try after so long to dial in his long story craft, but really, this book is bad, I'm only going to try one more novel before giving up on Neil as a long story author..He is of course still brilliant as a screen (Coraline) and comic (Sandman) writer."
3,Passable urban fantasy,"There's a parallel fantasy world underneath our feet and above our roofs. It's a dark and dangerous place, akin to the ""realm of faery"" of ancient European folk tales.Most sane, respectable people aren't aware of the place. _Neverwhere_ follows the adventures of a white-collar office drone who, after an act of uncharacteristic bravery, finds himself drawn into the parallel world beneath London.It's a wonderful set-up, with vivid characters and settings, but ultimately I felt only moderately entertained by this one.Anyone who has read Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett will find _Neverwhere's_ style and feel very familiar. I'm frankly kind of burned out on snarky, arch fantasy. If this sort of work hasn't worn out its welcome, you may enjoy it more than I did."
5,I love this book.,I have loved this book for so long now. I would almost beg for a sequel. The characters perhaps the best developed of any Gaiman has done keep this story fresh even years after the publication. I recommend the story highly. A true orginal.
3,"Good, but predictable.","Fascinating premises, interesting characters, and a noble purpose. Just the kind of book that could be great. There was just enough predictability to bring it down a notch.A good read for lighthearted entertainment."
3,"Fun and imaginative, but never natural","An imagination allowed to run wild. Definitely a fun read, and super-consumable. The plot and characters are a bit forced. I never escaped that sense of being told what to think and feel, so while the ideas are fantastic the story itself wasn't very rewarding."
3,meh,"I thought this book had great potential. I felt the author did pretty well at making his under London city come alive, but I do not think he did much to make his characters come alive. I didnt get to know door at all. I didnt much care for Richard. I loved the fox and wolf men. The plot was really good at the beginning and had such great potential... but I was let down. I am glad there was no romance in this.. I every once in a while like to find a book with no romance. It really was over all an okay book, but it could have been so much more!"
5,I am enchanted with Neil Gaimans Neverwhere,"I had never heard of Neil Gaiman, took a chance on the title and cheap price(bargin table) of the book. I just love it when I pick a good one! He had me by the 22nd page. His characters are endearing, frightening and funny. What an imagination the man has. He was able to pull me into his world with such ease. Can't wait for his next book, he is now on my favorite list."
3,Hampered by lack of story,"Gaiman has created a brilliant underground world using the names of London Underground stations to create settings and characters. This is a dark, enchanting world that I loved to explore along with the characters, who are also varied and intriguing. The problem with this book is that it is utterly lacking a story. Characters chase each other through foetid tunnels, gloomy rooftops, and abandoned buildings, but Gaiman provides no compelling reason for any of it. Very much like a comic book, the characters are great on the surface, but we never learn anything else about them. I really tried to like this book because it is a beauty for anyone who loves London or its Underground system. Unfortunately, the boring story left me at the station..."
4,A Hero with Yet a Another Face,"Of course, Neil Gaiman's first novel has been compared to ""Alice in Wonderland"" and his own Sandman comic series, but what this story most embodies is a Campbellian Hero's Mythic journey. This includes almost every element of Campbell's journey: a call to adventure, threshold crossing, the tests (complete with helpers), transfiguration, and return to the world. Gaiman's also touches on these themes in his later work ""American Gods""(and probably better there than ""Neverwhere"") and I think, no one is writing mythological stories as good as Gaiman right now. Gaiman manages to write about these themes with a wry sense of humour that never detracts from the importance of the stories he tells. This novel gets 4 stars instead of 5 only because I read ""American Gods"" first and I'm rating them relative to each other."
4,Entertaining,"Found the paperback displayed in a bookstore; had never heard of the author and the book lay tucked away for several months before I decided to read it and -- wow -- couldn't put it down. I thought the story (fantasy) original and enjoyed the characters. Good, quick read for summer holidays."
3,I have a mixed view of this book.,"I have never read anything by Neil Gaiman before, but this particular book grabbed my attention. While i did enjoy this book, it still fell just short of what I was expecting. The secondary characters, the Marguis de Carabas, the Lady Door, even the villianous Misters Croup and Vandemar were strongly written, full and realistic. Yet, the story's main character, Richard Mayhew, seemed strangely made of cardboard. His reactions to the happenings around him seem forced and predictable. He seemed to me to be an outsider to the entire novel, not just to the world of London Below. In my opinion, he just didn't fit."
2,Where's The Beef?,"This book started so promosing, but in the end was one big dissapointment. It was extremely anti-climactic and really did not go anywhere. Speaking rats - what more can I say. This novel is meant for a young teenage audience who are not mature enough to understand thoughtful writing."
1,Putdownable.,"I really wanted to finish this book - it came so highly recommended on Amazon. But with less than a hundred pages to go, I threw in the towel. By page 280, the author had done nothing but tell us what each of the three main characters were seeking. No information was teased out along the way, and I found that I didn't care whether any of them lived or died. I just wanted it to end. It seemed more like a dull adventure video game than a book, and I don't read video games."
1,i was not impressed.,"Neil Gaiman created another world below London called ""London Below"" that is unimaginative and disappointing. It was a silly attempt."
1,Boring. Tedious. Predictable. Dull.,"Gaiman is published, I'm not etc etc.I was reading this in good sessions, 60 pages or so at a time, and I got to around 300 in and just couldn't be bothered to finish it. I lost count of the number of times I rolled my eyes. The characters names e.g. Lord Rat-Speaker. Come on! That's the sort of thing you come up with when you're 12 and a write a story.After all the hype I was incredibly disappointed. Maybe I'm not a big enough believer in pixie dust and unicorns..."
1,Didn't care for it,I loved Good Omens so I gave this book a try. That got me to read Terry Pratchett - I figured HE must be the good one. I found this book boring and trite and just plain stupid.
2,You might enjoy this if you are under 17 years old,"Even then, you might not like it. Gaiman is a competent writer, capable of holding a story together and presenting a whole array of coherent characters. Unfortunately, this book reminds me of some of the fantasies I read when I was 15. At the time, I accepted them as semi-interesting stories, lacking depth (in characterization, in message, in storyline), but nonetheless worth the read. Perhaps I value my time more now than then, but parts of this book were boring and the characters were flatter than Eric. The humor and characters seemed to be aimed at a younger crowd, but occasional scenes and thoughts were very grown up. A strange mix that doesn't, at least for me, work."
2,Lame,"This book was a waste of time. It is the only Gaiman book I've read, but it doesn't belong anywhere near the best fantasy writing available today (like Rothfuss and Martin). The ""world"" isn't that great, and Gaiman leaves waaaaay too much unexplained. It also lacks any discernable theme. It kinda reads like a book that was written in one sitting and then never edited.Gaiman has a decent knack for dialogue, but he woefully lacks the talent to create a story with depth and breadth."
3,Fun to read but...,"It is rather plain book and I can't see what people find so special about it. The characters are way too comics-like and that might be just the problem - I don't like when comics books are written, I prefer them to be just a comics book.In fact, the only characters that I truly felt had some depth were the two murdering villians. Richard was in shock for 90% of the book, Hunter is flat (super hero) even though the twist in her story and Door didn't do anything to get any depth and was just another grey character.Other than that, the plot is fun, though the ending is way too weird for me, I don't like plots that twist so much without any visible explaination."
3,An odd little book,"This was an odd little book. Richard Mayhew is cast into a secret fantastical world beneath London after he stops to help an injured girl on the street. He encounters rat-speakers, a fierce bodyguard, and numerous other strange beings in his pursuit of the girl named Door. Trying to reclaim his former life, he is caught up in Door's quest and the mystery surrounding the death of her family as they flee enemies with an ever-changing agenda. I enjoyed this book, but I felt like I never quite knew what was going on. It lacked tension until the end but was otherwise enjoyable to read."
4,A very curious tale,"I've not finished the story yet (school really gets in the way sometimes), but what I have read is curious, complex, twisting, amusing, and fascinating. My best friend recommended it, and I would certainly do the same to those who enjoy mystery, adventure, fiction, and London."
3,Dissected plot,Vivid imagery. However continuity difficulties at times due to frequent shifting scenes and times with multiple characters enjoyed hero and adventures
4,excellent read!!,excellent read! could not wait to turn the pages. keeps you interested as to what happens next. will definitely look for more books by author.
3,First Gaiman book... eh...,"I have never really read anything by Gaiman, but my book club chose this book and a friend of mine is a HUGE fan. Like ""go stand in line for 2 hours so I can have him sign my book and say hi for 10 seconds"" fan. I was pretty excited to finally read something by this author. Truly, it was just okay for me. I get the ""gap"" and ""falling through the cracks"" and where he was going (and went pretty well) with it. However, my biggest problem was that the writing was just slightly overdone at times.It felt forced much of the time and slightly overwritten. Like the author was trying too hard. I got confused at places because he kept pulling us out of the story to feed this odd need to over explain - and then grazing over things that really could have used a little more explanation.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book. I just felt it was too much and too little all at once.Recommended for his multitude of rabid fans and those that enjoy a light fantasy."
3,Wouldn't recommend in 2010 for an avid fantasy reader.,"I found this novel somewhat difficult to finish. I actually debated discontinuing the read about half way through the work. The story seemed to lack meaningful character development and replacing much needed 'why's' with a collection of random events/encounters in a world that was not all that fantastic. In hindsight wondering to myself what all the hype was about, I did a little research. I can only guess that this novel became a launching pad for other great works to spring from since the storyline was around in 1996. One example would be a movie called 'Dark City' in the overall feel of the environment and villainy. I honestly do not know, but being an avid fantasy reader in 2010 I did not find this novel to be particularly notable in comparison to works that I am accustomed to since 1996. I give the novel 3 stars because I can see how other Author's and possibly screen writers works were influenced by the style and story of Neverwhere."
3,Average fairy tale,"The enjoyment of this read will depend on the preferences of the reader, if he likes to read fantastic tales in the line of ""Alice in Wonderland"", where the juicy part lies in the story and the interaction of some particular characters with magical powers it will suit him, however if he is looking to read a captivating fast paced thriller with a plot full of twists and turns and featuring a surprising ending, this is not the book as he will find many chapters. a bit naive, repetitive and tedious and the ending good but somewhat contrived. I would not say, the book is bad, but it is not dominated by an special charm to make it unforgettable."
5,A fantasy about modern alienation,"A wonderful fantasy about an imaginary London that lurks below our everyday life, it's also a powerful meditation on the alienation of people living a modern life, our addiction to things instead of experiences, and the casual we we ignore those who are not as lucky as we may be. Oh, and it is also wildly entertaining, vivid and compelling fiction with characters that are difficult to forget."
5,"If you never read anything again, read this","I discovered Neil Gaiman in an airport bookshop. While wading through the piles of Grisham, King, and Crichton, one cover caught my eye. It was Neverwhere. I spent a good part of my vacation in Hawaii with my nose in this book. The moment I finished, I took it to my Dad and told him that he had to start reading it immediately. Since then, both of us have read it several times. This is an amazing book. There is no other way to put it. Neil Gaiman is the only person alive who could write a story about a dangerous, hellish underworld, and make you want to be there.P.S. I could see this as a really good movie, too. I'd cast Ewan Mcgregor as Richard, and Michelle Pfeiffer as Hunter."
4,There and back again,"All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!"
5,Loved it!,"After reading Stardust, I was hooked on Neil Gaimans writing. Neverwhere did not let me down. Great characters, captivating storyline. I read this in two sittings."
5,My favorite escape novel,"I'm a big fan of Neil Gaiman, and I bought this book as soon as it came out. It became one of my favorite novels to read, and when I was depressed I'd hide in my room and read it for escape and pretend I was in London Below. Neverwhere is one of those books that is so easy to slip into and feel like you fit right in. The characterizations of Richard, Door, Hunter, Anaesthasia, Marquis Carabas, and the very evil, very creepy villains, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, are extremely well-done! They feel real and whole and you do care about them. The story itself is exciting and surreal and makes me proud of being a Neil fan. His writing and imagination is top-notch here, bringing up some disturbing images while also being very funny. Highly recommended to fantasy and sci-fi fans, or just people who love books."
5,"Awesome, just awesome!","A beautifully produced volume of the author's preferred text. If you're a Neil Gaiman fan, this is definitely a special edition for your collection. Comparable to the Hill House editions of American Gods and Anansi Boys. I'm going to enjoy reading and re-reading this volume."
4,A bit of a disappointment,"How can I give an 8 to a book I consider a bit of a disappointment? Especially considering it's a first (solo) novel? Well, I saw the BBC television series first, and it was outstanding. One of the greatest television shows of all time. Naturally, the book should be even better--right? Well, sort of. There are a couple of places where more material is added in the book, but for the most part, it is just a novelization. I suppose my expectations were too high, so when the book wasn't one of the all time greats, I was disappointed."
3,This is about Neverwhere.,"Neverwhere, by Neil Gaimen, is the story of Richard Meyhew, a normal person who one night literaly runs into a girl badly hurt, named Door. He has no option but to help her. The next morning after he had helped her, and she left, he realized that knowone regognizied him.I found this book fairly interesting. I liked how as a setting he used Londons underground rail. I recomend this book, to anyone who likes eccentric types of books."
4,Me again,"What I meant by that Neil's style is somewhat simple is that he lacks a sense of structure (in this book, anyway); take Alan Moore or Emily Bronte, they certain have a good sense of organization. Neil's style is too matter-of-fact, too Hemingway for me."
5,"I thouroughly enjoyed this book, didn't want it to end","I found the characters great, fun,scary,. I was so glad when Richard went back to be with the underworld. Neil Gaiman is a fine author. I would like to read more."
5,If only Neverwhere was Neverending...,"This is an excellent book. Not only is it imaginative, creative, yada yada yada, but it's so much fun to read! If you like fantasy, action-adventure, or just plain books, you'll like this one."
3,Fascinating story; lackluster characters,"This story was built with a rich imagination. I loved reading about what odd scenario the characters would find themselves in next. It was clever, interesting, and quite a page turner. The characters, however, especially Richard and Door, were too shallow. I never took to them the way I wanted to. I didn't long for their success. Door had so much potential, but the details just never came out, and Richard, well he was mostly a doofus. If this author could make us really care for the characters, this would be world-class storytelling."
2,I tried to like it,"Neverwhere, like most of Gaiman's fiction, to my mind, seems very scattered. I always enjoy the worlds he creates, but the actual denoument leaves much to be desired. No matter how much his work matures, he always reads like a young Stephen King to me -- great ideas, but the endings are so godawful as to ruin the entire book.Neverwhere has a crappy BBC made-for-tv movie version. It's only slightly worse than the book, and it will save you a slog through the original text."
2,Disappointing,I read the Graveyard Book and loved it for its originality but found this one disappointing and full of cliches.
4,it was good,"I read this a few years ago. I don't remember the details but I liked that it was different how he was a regular guy, an unlikely hero."
2,Ultimately Forgettable,"There really wasn't a whole lot to this book, and after seeing so many positive reviews of it, I had to give my opinion.As the title of this review suggests, this book is overall forgettable and not worth the money to read. I liked the premise, but I didn't at all care for the characters, everything seemed rush and the 'villain' of the story and his reasons for being said villain come out of nowhere AT THE END OF THE BOOK.The problem is that in the end, there's nothing that makes it stand out."
3,Written for young adults,"I liked this book, and I love the alternate reality/universe/world storyline. I just wish someone else had written the book. Stephen King, Connie Willis, Caleb Carr or anyone else who could write more descriptively.I was hoping for a book like the Talisman, by Stephen King, and ended up being disappointed.If you like fantasy books, I am sure you will like this one. If you want a book dripping with ambience, atmosphere and writing aimed at adults, this book is not for you."
2,Unimpressive story with unlikable characters,"The hero is a boring, mundane, dumb as a post British businessman, the sort of character that you often see in British fiction, and always seem to see in British fantasy.The story revolves around a magic world beneth London where the homeless and lost really live. I found that just offensive to turn the real tragity of homelessness into a trite fantasy fairy tale.I didn't care about the characters, and although the setting was decent (once I stopped being annoyed by the idea) the conflict wasn't too impressive.In the end, the boring british guy discovers his own potential for greatness (good for him! I didn't see any potential for greatness in him at all) and chooses the magic London fairy land over his boring life.Yawn.AIM"
3,"Again, not particularly good","My brother likes Gaiman's books. He's younger so that might explain it, but there's not much plot to any I've read so far. It's more like a series of things happen, and then more stuff happens, and then the book ends."
3,Abrubtly cut short ending,"I was so swept up in this story with all of it's unexpected twists and turns and fabulous characters. However, as the book winds down, it seems as if the writer was in a hurry to finish and the characters suddenly become shallowly depicted. It seemed as if the ending was re-written to condense it and the way the main characters leave things made little sense and left me feeling cheated. Overall, A good writer but the ending made me feel like I wasted the hours I enjoyed at the beginning of the book."
2,Emotionally flat,"While Neverwhere presents a fascinating premise, the characters who live in this world are emotionally flat. Gaiman creates a world that is so violent and dark that it's completely inexplicable why the main character would abandon all that he knows to permanently enter this world. This decision ultimately reveals the character's utter failure to emotionally connect with anyone in his life, and his decision to leave his world cannot change who he is, only where he will live out the remainder of his lonely and unconnected existence."
2,disappointing,"This was just a disappointing book. Wonderful, intriguing concept and I wanted to like it. The stage was set - mood, characters, etc. but concept was never fully developed. I had to force myself to finish reading it. One that I would never recommend or reread."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Otherworld slip mystery.A young man not particularly going anywhere finds himself losing touch a bit more with the garden variety normal world, and slowly begins to realise there is more around him than he realises.Thanks to a meeting he is drawn into this other society and out of his shell by way of this mendicant supernatural society.While the ordinary world was a bit dull, this one is full of danger and weird that he has to negotiate, whether friends, or new enemies."
3,"Really good, then the ending","This book was incredible. It was really well written and I was enjoying it throughly, but then I reached the ending. I felt that the ending was really stupid, as if it had been written by another author. Still, check it out and make up your own climax."
4,excellent book!,"i loved this book. i couldn't put it down. it drew me in, and i got attatched to the characters; door, hunter, richard. Neil made you feel like there really WAS a london below. there should be a sequel, after the ending, i want to know what happens to richard and door's sister! all in all, this is an excellent book."
5,Perfect combination of fantasy and reality.,"If you like Steven King and Clive Barker, ever wanted to visit the places you read about in Everville, The Talisman or the Gunslinger books, Neverwhere is right up your alley."
5,My first experience reading Neil Gaiman,"Neverwhere was the first book I read by Gaiman. In fact, I'd never heard of him before my sophomore English teacher gave us Neverwhere to read for a class assignment. Previously, I had absolutely no interest in fantasy; this book, however, completely changed my mind. Neverwhere isn't your typical fantasy novel - Gaiman's writing is gorgeous and exciting."
4,Stunning other-world experience.,"I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy and admit to being jaded. However, Gaiman's work in this book is beautifully written, suspenseful, and original. As with his style, there is humor and clever twists to the story of a man lost in an alternate London... seeking his fate among mystical vagabonds, mysterious magics... and a myriad of bizarre characters. (ok, I've used up my M's.)I read this in 2 nights flat, and sighed when it was done. Recommend heartily. Only 4 stars because I thought the ending was a bit pat, or perhaps I was just annoyed that it ended at all."
3,A bit overated,"The characters were very unique and the setting straight out of a child's dream, but overall the book was slow. I felt it lacked that crucial element that makes a book into a ""book you can't put down"". Perhaps I just expected too much, reading all those great reviews. So judge for yourself - give it a try."
5,Everywhere unseen,"This book has characters that keep you interested and a plot so imaginative that it kept me turning pages till my eyes hurt. It is one of the best books I have read, and I read alot. Gaiman makes his characters real enough for you to feel scared for Door and Richard. He makes the marquis come to life with his wonderful description of him."
4,Too much walking on the surface...,"I found myself turning the pages but being disappointed at the lack of depth. The characters are just that-characters and not ""living"" people. It is a good read and I loved the concept. If you like to stay on the surface of things-read it"
5,Completely mesmerizing,"This is the first material by Neil Gaiman I've read, a situation I must rectify immediately if this book is an true example of his work. I found the world created by Gaiman to be fascinating, horrorifying, comic, violent, bittersweet and just a little too realistic. It takes very little to believe such a fantastic world exists and Gaiman is masterful at sucking you into it completely. The characters are fascinating and all too human (even when they're not) and the entire plot line gripping. I literally couldn't put this book down and I immediately wanted to read further adventures of Mayhew and Door and their many colorful associates. This is not for sci-fi/fantasy fans only. Neverwhere takes you places you've never been, even though you've been there often. Great book! Steve Isenhowe"
4,A fun read!,"This book is a real fun read. I read the British version and really enjoyed it. It is the story of 2 Londons, the London that we know and the London underneath which is invisible to us and what happens when someone for above falls throught to the underworld.I hope that we get to see the tv program that was made of this."
5,One of the best pieces of fiction ever written.,Gaiman is a master of putting words on paper. From his masterful wit to stark horror found in the truths of our society. His works of fantasy take to you from the past to modern times without skipping a beat. Neverwhere is a perfect example of great fantasy and how it should be done. The characters are real in your mind and you want to join them on their trip throughout (literally) London.
4,Get Lost in London Below!,"I have been looking forward to reading Neverwhere for some time. I finally picked up a copy at a used bookstore and settled on reading it; Neverwhere did not disappoint. The first few pages went by effortlessly as Gaiman drew me in by sympathizing with the somewhat boring a predictable life of Richard Mayhew. As soon as a half bloodied up young girl is found crumpled before him on the pavement, Richard's whole life changes. Gaiman takes you on an adventure in London below where he uses the Underground tube map to guide you around the stations you once thought you knew...I couldn't put Neverwhere down each time I picked it up. Several hours easily went by as I consumed this book rapidly. I strongly recommend it. It will leave you smiling at the end."
3,Falling through Society's Cracks,"Interesting and well-wrought premise: ""falling through society's cracks"" as being more than simply symbolic. Liked ALL the characters.This is full-throttle alternate universe, which may be perfectly your cup of tea, but is a little too action-packed hectic for me. Still love Gaiman."
5,"Graceful, vivid writing (spoiler)","Highlight of this deftly-constructed fantasy is Gaiman's elegant but powerful prose style. Template of ordinary man thrust into increasingly bizarre parallel world was also powerfully done in Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide series and Spencer's Resume with Monsters, but Gaiman still has much to add. Some interesting trivia about the history of London, and London's ambience and atmosphere powerfully drawn.There is a clever allusion to Neuromancer in novel's comparison of the blue of the sky to a ""television tuned to a dead channel"" (note that at the time Neuromancer was written, that signified a different color.)Gaiman has strong logical underpinning, although there was no apparent reason that Croup & Vandemar did not consume de Carabas as they did to their previous victim. Only structural imperfection is that the ending feels tacked on and wanders on a bit long.Nevertheless, well worth reading for its plot, characters and writing."
5,Just beyond the surface,I enjoyed this book. I have read a couple of books by Gaiman this one was by far his most enjoyable. He seems to write about things that are just beyond our perceptions. I wish that he would have gone into more detail about these people who have slipped between the cracks...Anyways I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to friends.
4,Enjoyable novel,"Mr. Gaiman often adds fun details to his books, and this is no exception. It's a book I enjoyed a lot, though not quite as much as American Gods. Overall, this book made for an enjoyable read, and any Gaiman fan should enjoy this. If it's your first Gaiman work, be warned that Gaiman writes stories that are different. If you're into fantasy and alternate realms, this book will definitely be a good reading experience!"
4,"Great, but not for Neil","If anybody else had written this book, I would have loved it and I never would have raised a finger, but I really did expect more from Neil Gaiman. It did not have the depth or literary value of Sandman, but I will say that it is an entertaining story and will not let you down if you don't have any preconceived expectations."
4,This is actually about a 4- read,"I read NEVERWHERE after one of my web site's reviewers reviewed STARDUST and attracted the attention of Mr. Gaiman. As a result of that review and my reading NEVERWHERE and GOOD OMENS, I interviewed him and that interview can be found at All About Romance at http://www.likesbooks.comI enjoyed NEVERWHERE and was taken by its quixotic nature and how fun the author made the villains, well, most of them. It was also the most ""visual"" book I've ever read, which fascinated me. Having interviewed the author, I'm all the more fascinated!TTFN, Laurie Likes Books"
3,Just didnt get sucked in,"I really tried with this book because of all of the positive reviews, but I just didn't get sucked in. I suppose it was because the first 150 pages I just could not connect with the characters in the bookOtherwise it was well written, and it was a refreshing style. It just didn't have the goods to get me interested."
5,Wonderful dark fantasy,"Neverwhere was one of those books that really sticks in my mind. I don't think I'll ever forget its characters and images. At heart it's a standard fish-out-of-water-turned-hero story, but Gaiman's dark humor and incredible imagination make it far from formulaic. This is the best novel I've read in a long time.I wasn't a Neil Gaiman fan; I picked up Neverwhere because the jacket copy caught my eye. I've now read everything by Gaiman I can get my hands on, and it's almost all terrific.This book would be great for kids 12 and older. It's intended for adults, but I would have loved it at that age."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,Bought this book because is sounded like a book from another author. This book is well written and I am sure the other books this author has written are good as well. This is just not my cup of tea. If you like books with horror mixed into an everyday story then this is the book for you.
2,I didn't buy into it at all.,"I watched the superb Hellboy Golden Army film while I was reading this so so novel, and it really hammered in my dissatisfaction with this book. This occured because of the wonderful underground world that was created in Hellboy if not by Del Toro, then the person who wrote the original graphic novel. The whole London Underground thing which ties the names of tubestops to characters is absurd and ridiculous. Imagine if Neil Gaiman were not a household name (sort of) but a first time novelist trying to pitch this story to Tor publishing. He would be thrown out within seconds. Luckily Gaiman has a wonderful imagination and is a gifted writer so all is not lost. But lame is really the best word I can come up with to describe the whole plot. I loved American Gods and Stardust, but Gaiman is definitely hit and miss in my book."
2,Lame,"I made it half way through. But come on, aside from the character mentally noting several times that his life was gone, the author made no attempt to make him appear at all concerned that he had lost everything and was now in a completely alien environment. Even worse: Could anyone possibly protect door from the killers? No...only Hunter could stand a chance. And GEE, guess who shows up as the bodyguard a few pages later. Oh Hunter! There you are! Glad they worked you in so well. And the lame image of the ""knockout amazon"" was too much. Anytime a strong female character appears in these shallow books, she has to be stacked. Please. Also, the characters of Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandawhatever were shamelessly stolen from the Bond movie ""Diamonds are Forever."" So I guess what I'm saying is skip this one."
1,Neverwhere... goes NOwhere,"Based on what I've heard about this author and the interesting premise for this tale, I was greatly disappointed. Although I was drawn in at the beginning, I soon realized that this was just an endless series of underground characters engaging in violent acts against each other while the plot meanders along passageways with little explanation for events and an ultimately disappointing conclusion. I may give Mr. Gaiman another try, but based on this first taste it will be a while before I bother. This was even suggested to me as a possible young adult novel, but I would suggest parents steer clear unless your student is a high schooler or older. I won't be surprised if others rank this review as ""not helpful"" because they disagree, but please respect an alternative opinion. I am an open-minded, avid reader of a wide variety of genres, so I thought it only fair to include an honest review from a different perspective. Hope it helps wavering customers."
2,"starts good, but then...","I've always enjoyed the Sandman comics, and that prevented me from reading this novel when it was first released; just because Gaiman can write a superb comic, does that mean he can write a good novel? After reading it, my answer is no. It's very unfortunate, however, because his protagonist, Richard Mayhew, is very well characterized, and quite funny at times. I had a hard time understanding just what the point of this novel was. My guess: it's a version of those D&D quest-novels I overdosed on back in the early 80s. If you suffer from fantasy role-playing burnout such as I do (since junior high), avoid this book. Also, I figured Gaiman could be a bit more creative and avoid the ""lost subterranean world"" fall-back setting."
2,too slow for me,"I saw all the positive reviews for this book and decided to grab it. I can't for the life of me figure out why people love it so much. It was one of the few books I didn't want to finish. Granted, it was excellent storytelling...but the story, in my opinion, is boring. With little to no action, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a little adventure."
5,Excellent Fantasy Book,"Neverwhere is an excellent fantasy book (as my review title implies :p) based in modern day England. In the book, Richard Mayhew is a young man who's decision to help a wounded and bleeding girl he finds lying on the sidewalk. This act propells him into the world of London Below, a dark, magical version of London that cannot be seen by the inhabitants of normal London, also called London Above. When Richard returns to London Above and finds that he doesn't exist there, he is forced to stay in London Below and help the girl he found on the sidewalk in her quest to find out who killed her family, and why."
4,Neverwhere,"Neverwhere was the first book i'd read by neil gaiman, long before i'd read any of the Sandman work he's done. And i loved the book more then i had anything i'd veiwed before. And still do. The ability to transform the world and places in that world into something obviously appropriate for those who wished to see it as that.Neverwhere takes you deep underground and into worlds that you would possibbly never even consider exsisting with charecters that capture your intrest."
2,Confusing,"On the paperback edition of this book, one reviewer is quoted, comparing Neverwhere to ""a dark, contemporary Alice in Wonderland..."" I must agree, Neil Gaiman's writing is just as confusing as that of Lewis Carroll's, except less ""classic"". Some ideas were appealing to me, such as the young girl Door's ability to ""open"" things, but most were not. (For example, the London Below is a whole seperate world made of sewers, rats, people who speak to rats, and people who speak to rats who are taken away by the ""darkness"" never to be seen again.) Many concepts are left unexplained, and the ending is unfulfilling."
3,Popcorn for the mind.,"I ""liked"" this book in the same way I ""like"" popcorn. It provided an immediate rush of flavor and texture without actually satisfying my deeper hunger. It reads like a screenplay (which is not surprising, since it was originally developed as a TV series) and some of the author's more obvious ""let's see how our Sympathetic Male Character is affected by his Flaw"" work irritated me greatly. I would have enjoyed this much more if Mr. Gaiman had created it in the medium he is most obviously suited for -- graphic novels."
2,A bit disappointing,Being a loyal Terry Pratchett-fan I thought I'd read a book written by the co-author of Good Omens. I have to admit that Gaiman's style is rather original and the plot is quite good as well... yet his writing style was not as imaginitative as I had imagined. I finished the book and was left with an unsatisfied feeling.
5,Sorry about the confusion,"this a good book. it is reaeally good fool. It is like fantasy, but not really. it is good. it is a good book that is good and it is a book, see, it is a good book and i liked this book beacuse it was a book that was a good book that was good."
5,Awesome,"This book just flies off the pages. The charaters are so easy to like (or hate, or fear) and the world is so real I found myself up until 2 A.M. just to get to the finish and when I finally got there I was just sad that their wasn't more. I hope Neil Gaiman writes a sequel. Excellant book."
3,A bit disappointed,"Perhaps it's just that I read this book in-between reading A Separate Peace and The Life of Pi, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the the author's writing ability. Good ideas, but not well executed. I hoped to be moved and captivated like I was when I read Clive Barker's Imajica, but the author isn't able to invest his characters with enough depth to make them memorable."
3,"Great premise, but falls flat","Gaiman starts out with a dilemma for protaganist Richard Mayhew: he can either help an injured woman on the streets of London, ruin dinner plans with his fiancees boss, and cost him the relationship OR he can pass the woman by in the hopes that someone else stops to help.Mayhew gives up life as he knows it after stopping to help. The next thing he knows, he's plunged into a London parallel universe frought with danger and adventure.While Gaiman's premise and plotline are genuinely creative, the storytelling falls flat in critical points, leaving the reader disappointed. Contrasted with Gaiman's American Gods (both creative, witty and well-written), I'd recommend reading American Gods over Neverwhere."
4,Suprisingly Good,I have never been a reader of fantasy or science fiction and wasn't sure I would like this book. It was like reading a fairytale. It was really interesting and has inspired me to read more by Gaiman and other writers like him. Give it a try!
5,Awesome Fantasy!,"I'm not usually a fantasy fan, but for this I would make an exception. The book is fantastic and grabs you right at the beginning. Having been to London recently and gone everywhere on the tube this book holds a special place. Neil Gaiman takes the everyday world and twists it into something fantastic. Definitely a must-read."
4,Worlds' creator,"If I have to write a review about every Gaiman book I like, I'll become a writer myself. ""Neverwhere"" is such a nice, page-turner story! Sometimes I feel like NG could make a good story out of an empty tax form. This book, though, didn't hit me as wonderfully as ""American Gods"" (and that might be the only reason why I gave it four stars), but the mastery for creating new worlds and compelling characters is right there. Please don't stop writing, Mr. Gaiman."
4,Awesome world created by Gaiman,"I simply love the story told so well by Gaiman in his way. while not at all the best of his works, it is still quite capturing, even the second time.You cannot miss with Neil Gaiman. purchase without guilt."
5,Great Adventure awaits when you fall through the cracks!,"Stopping to help a young,strangely dressed woman seemed like a good idea at the time. Richard has to rethink his choices when he awakens the next day with no job,home or identity--however he can speak to rats,through their interpretors and associate with the most colorful, if deadly characters put to paper. London Below is full of creatures and times that have fallen through the cracks of time and space. Danger and adventure are around every corner. A great get-away read."
3,Alice in not quite Wonderland for Grown-ups,"Apparently a story-from-the-scriptGreat fantasy ... so wouldn't mind seeing the show-from-the-script.Neil Gaiman actually wrote ""Stardust"" (one of our fav fantasy movies) ... have bought that book but haven't read it yet (waiting for the movie to fade from imagination). So meanwhile we have been taste-testing other Gaiman's (and the bonus it that through him we have got on to Kadrey).I enjoyed this soooooo much more than ""American Gods"". He created another world that exists under London. It is kind of an Alice In Wonderland for grown-ups. It keeps your interest through all the travails of the hero."
3,Free preview pages much better than rest of the book,"After reading the free preview pages I was anxious to purchase the book on Kindle and read it. I rarely spend more than $4 on any Kindle book and so this was a treat for me. However, once I got past where the free pages left off the book took stranger and stranger turns. I had a hard time buying into the world the author created. At times I forced myself to keep going just because I paid for it. By the final 1/3 of the book, it did come together and form a cohesive narrative."
5,Honestly this book is one of my top ten.,"This is the story of a simple ordinary man who because of an act of kindness,for doing the right thing.,has his life turned down side up. He becomes a hero because a hero is what is needed. In each situation he is placed he does the honorable thing. The characters, from angel to senile earl, are the stuff of fantasy, but the setting, modern day London and then some, is .just a step away from reality. An unforgetable morality tale."
1,Weak,"I've tried these pliers on a number of projects and found they don't work. They lock so loosely that I hold more firmly with my bare hand. I adjusted the settings from weakest to strongest and didn't see a lot of change. It definitely held a little better on the strongest setting, but no where near strong enough to get through the tasks I needed them for."
5,Love these,"Great design. Works so much better and easier than the other design for locking pliers. And this brand is very sturdy. I thought I'd be cheap and bought a small cobalt brand locking pliers from Lowes for $5 less than this pair. It sucked. Wouldn't grab worth a crap, kept slipping off of things. A pain to use compared to these. These are very much worth 5 more dollars. These may be not as non-flexing as the larger pair of hanson locking pliers, but they are half the size. They are still way more sturdier than other brands that are similar sizes. Frankly I've yet to notice a difference between these and my larger pair, but I've only just got these a few days ago."
5,Finally!!,"This is by far the best tv show of all time. Even my seven year old son begs to watch it. I can't wait to own them all. Also, check out Tim Daly in Private Practice on ABC in September. He has always been my favorite."
5,Wings the 5th season,"Love it! I loved this show when it was on TV. As there is mostly nothing enjoyable on TV anymore, I enjoy having these to watch."
4,One of the funniest,"I discover this when I finished watching Cheers, and I was no disappointed. I love Brian, Joe, Roy, and of course Antonio. I also like Casey and Fay, but I can't stand Helen. I think she is one of the worst actresses -she overacts all the time- I've ever seen but the others are so good that I enjoyed the series despite her."
4,Great Gift for a Wings fan,"This product was great to give my sister-in-law who loves the tv series ""WINGS"". Arrived before Christmas as promised."
5,thank you,Enjoyed this product so much. I would definetly buy from this seller again. Fast service and product was in great shape. Thank you
5,My visitation to the clinic is excellent!!!,"I love this album! I strongly recommend this to anyone. Other than the music, check out the artwork on the album cover is so psychedelic. Last, but not least this a great seller with such great prices for hard to find items. Also I recommend this seller."
4,Return to form - whatever that means.,"If you like Clinic, you'll like this album - if you don't know who they are, it's a better introduction than Winchester Cathedral. Better than Walking With Thee for the relative diversity. More focused and cohesive than Internal Wrangler, but without the initial feeling of discovery that comes with that album. On this one, they know what they do best and do it."
4,"Moving, Gentle Story of Two Gringos and a General in Mexico.",This is a quiet gentle story of an aging man who comes to Mexico to die by the hand of Pancho Villa and an American woman who eventually finds herself involved with a Villa general. Both have baggage in the US and are trying to find something in Mexico that has been missing from their lives.
3,Class Assignment,"I would not have read this book on my own. My literature instructor at Santa Monica College assigned it. It took a while for me to get into the book. I would recommend it if you are looking for something totally different than a fast pace, exciting read."
5,A Little Gem,"A wonderful, engrossing, stylishly written, suspenseful, compact gem of a book. But after reading it, I was shocked to find the average customer rating to be 3 stars. This was based on just 2 reviews, one giving it 5 stars and the other 1 star. I suggest that an average rating not be given when the number of reviews is so small, where the effect of just one negative review (which I find in this case to be completely unjustified) can be devastating and misleading to potential readers."
3,"Bring On More Red, Crackly Creatures - YAY!!!!","As a sequel to the story 'Planet of Evil' I find this book a success as it doesn't tread old ground like nearly every other sequel out there in sequel land. But, as with all books, there are some boring parts - mostly political situations. This is not one of the greatest books written, nor is it the worst. It's one of those that fit in the 'alright' category. But it does have an appearance by the red, see-through, crackly creature. Oh yeah, once AGAIN, Nyssa is turned into ANOTHER creature. No wonder she chose to stay in a leper colony instead of with the Doctor."
2,A Review,"Overlong and complicated,a sequel to Planet Of Evil wasn`t needed.There are some nice ideas here,waiting to burst out,unfortunately it just doesn`t happen.Characterisation is haphazard making it difficult to enjoy or appreciate."
5,Great Book!,"This is one of the best books by Pearl Buck. It is a story of inter-racial love and the challenges faced by a Japanese woman and an american soldier and the fate on an innocent child who is deprived of love and caring from both parents, thanks to the society we live in. Unfortunately, these situations are prevalent even today!A great book which would appeal to every man and woman who have ever faced the demands of love!"
2,The Plague of readability,"I have no doubt that this book was originally outlined as a historical thesis, as its general readability [outside of the final chapters] is very poor. Yes, there is factual data amongst the 288 pages, and it does manage to paint a picture of what occurred in Europe at the time, although it is seemingly repetitive. One does not really get a sense of the disastrous effects of the Black Death upon society until the final chapter, and even then the true harm is left to the reader to imagine.If the point of this book was just to look at the historical event from a statistical/scientific point of view, then this book might have been abridged to an extended magazine article.Interesting, but a bit too pedantic."
3,Polish Folk Song collection,"Have most of this group's work, so comparing it with the others it has some of their most popular and delightful songs ie Kadzioleczka, W olszynie, Co ja mysle, Laura i Filon. I prefer these to the ""village"" medleys but I'm sure other people would enjoy those, especially those who were born in Poland and these would bring special memories. As always the singing and harmony is lovely and the orchestration also, though I find some of the old rustic instruments a little discordant."
5,I like the rolling pin!,"I am very pleased with this rolling pin. It's a nice weight, light enough to manage but still heavy enough to do a good job. I used to use a marble rolling pin but it was so heavy and this is a pleasure to use. It's easy enough to clean, too. I would recommend this rolling pin to anyone."
2,Not much helpful,"I had great expectations in this book however was disappointed after reading it. Only 20% of the situation is helpful, there's not a lot of information that a grown up wouldn't know. Most of them are just common sense - don't gossip, don't get personal, etc. For the price it is not a great resource as I expected."
3,"A lady, apparently, does not say much","Pretty much everything in this book should be common sense, but as we all know, common sense is quite uncommon. I was somewhat irritated that pretty much every other page says, given the situation, a lady is supposed to ""say nothing."" This book didn't tell me anything I did not already know."
5,Great book,This is a great refresher on manners. It is also a great gift for someone that needs to learn a bit of Etquette without being hurtful to a friend.
2,As A Lady Would Say,This is just common sense. I did not find anything in this book that was new to me. In any event I gave it to Goodwill and hope it helps somebody.
2,only 50% applicable,"There are some useful rules that I pick up from this book. Yet, if you apply the whole book in real life situation, you'll look like a total snob. Also, most of the content is common sense, such as, don't be rude, give positive responses, etc."
1,Common Sense,"Unless someone grew up with no social graces, this book is full of absolute common sense. A unfortunate complete waste of money, do not buy"
2,nothing new,"I didn't find nothing new in this book, just common sense, the only thing I want to practise is to keep my mouth shut when someone is rude and that I don't have to answer anything that is not only going to show how clever I am (not that I think so) but to put me at the same level of the offender.- And I don't really agree with not saying anything to a pregnant woman, of course I say nothing when I only have a clue but I'm not sure if the lady is pregnant or not, but when it is pretty obvious I believe it would be rude of me if I don't say nothing, congratulate or show some kind of interest, it is something big in anyone's life, I believe.-"
2,As A Lady would say,"The book to be given as a gift seemed to be ordered well in advance, but didn't come on time.....regretfully. However when it did come, and the receiver got the issue....she claimed it to be ""just fair"" So I guess that gets a negative x 2 response.And this ridicuously silly website does not have a submit button for answering the review. Howconsumer dastardly can a company be????"
2,a few highlights but not quite enough,"i was expecting pearls of wisdom in life's truly awkward moments.after reading it, it felt like having just had a chat with one's auntie - nice, pleasant and somewhat helpful. however, i could have just had that chat instead.i have since stumbled across a book called Life Scripts, which is more what i was hoping for in this book (and what this book isn't)."
5,A must read for every man that has sex with men!!,"When I decided to buy this book I was hoping for some insight info about sex with men. I am bisexual and in my country (southern Europe) sex between men is just something that nobody discusses...Dr. Goldstone knows what he is talking about, he is blunt but very informative; he goes straight to the point and gives you lots of important information on how to take the most out of gay sex and be disease free...You definitely have to read this book, even if you have been in bed with thousands of men and think ""you know it all""...believe me...you don't..."
1,Disappointing follow-up,"I bought this CD and gave an entire listen and I hate to say that it will likely be the last time I listen to it. If you liked Anthony David's previous CD, don't get this one expecting more of the same. Gone are the acoustic style and Bill Withers-style songs. This new CD has a very rap-infused beat with drum machines and over-produced vocals. It's a shame and I hope that this talented singer hasn't blown his chance."
5,if you loved the first album,"you'll love this one too. it's still sincere, but has less acoustics... but still... i dunno, he managed to hang onto his realness and he still stands out as one of the best neosoul artists. i can't say which song is my favorite, they're all great. i really like ""something about you"" and ""smoke one""."
4,Good Music!,"I recognized his voice from Jessica Care Moore's CD...he was tight on track #9 and his new CD is just as phat & meaningful....its one thang to be able to sing, its another thang to use that gift meaningfully...he's done both and that's what's up...buy the CD and continue to support POSITIVE Black Music!"
5,Excellent!!!,"I live in Atlanta and have seen Anthony perform live numerous times. I just picked up a copy of his latest CD today and I absolutely LOVE IT!!! I like it even better than his first CD. My favorites are ""Smoke One, ""Everything is Everything"" and ""On and On"""
4,A Good Deal,"This set of clamps is reasonably priced, apparently well made, and ergonomically designed. As an amateur luthier I found them a good value, and as it is said, You can never have too many clamps."
5,"Denali 2-Inch Soft Grip Spring Clamps, 10-Pack","Tight grip and holds as they should with no slip. The ends that clamp, also swivel to fit the piece better when clamping so it can be used with odd shapes. Great product!"
5,"Stripped Down, Beautifully Simple and Oh So Sweet","If you like the Coen Brothers ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" soundtrack, you'll love this CD! It captures authentic old- time music at it's best. Americana, Appalachia, simpler times...it all at the heart of The Acres music."
1,"Dark, darker, darkest","I was pulled into this book like a moth to a flame. I kept reading to see where it would end. Endless graphic sex scenes between one character, and then another who was cheating on another one. The whole premise of the book was intriguing, but the author never pulled it off. Not one character had any redeeming qualities. Flat dialog ran throughout. This is such a dark story, it makes you feel that the author holds absolutely no faith in humankind. It went from chapter to chapter, as each character spiraled down and out of control.If you love to watch ""B"" movies and soap operas, you could probably tolerate this book.It seemed to be a good book, a page turner, which it was, but the ending was as flat as the dialog."
1,Run Away! Run Away!,"I was foolish enough to believe the reviews. This is one of the worst books I have ever purchased. Poorly written, shabby editing and a pathetic story line. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, and ended up throwing it away (along with my money)."
4,Too Close to the real thing,"A friend gave me a copy of this book, and to my surprise it was very good reading. The only thing that was out of place is that this book and its content seemed too real.As a child a family in my block had this same thing happen to them.When the father died his other family came to the funeral. The book kept me interested and it was full of twist and turns. Miss Black keep up the good work and get another book out soon."
2,Just OK.,"I had heard a lot of good things about this book, so when I got it, I moved it to the top of my ""to be read"" book pile. I was very disappointed. I found it very boring until the very end, and some of the topics were a bit controversial. All in all not a total waste of time, but I won't be searching out another book by this author."
2,"I read it on vacation, and threw it out when I was finished.","This book was highly recommended, which is why I purchased it. Glad I bought it used because I threw it out when I was finished. Just a predictable romance novel. Not at all what I had hoped for."
1,I truly can't believe we're reviewing the same book,"I'm sorry, but I can't believe the accolades this book has received. And I'm quite disappointed that I spent $18.00 on this paperback. Sure, the book had a fun premise about a man living a dual life, but the ending was the most depressing, suicidal conclusion I've unfortunately had the experience to read. Please, if you want to read it, save yourself the money and get it from the library. Although this is one book that I won't donate to neither a library nor a women's shelter, as I normally do with non-keepers."
1,"Terrible Writing, Terrible Book","The author must have a slew of friends to have so many positive reviews. Based on the glowing reviews, I made the mistake of buying this book. Cardboard, unlikeable characters; unbelievable plot; and just plain boring! If there was a minus rating, I'd use it."
3,Not what I expected,"It took me a long time to finish this one; it was so slow at the beginning. The story wasnt really unbelievable, but some parts left me wondering. I do know that there are some men that do live like Reginald, but the whole ""sleeping with his best friend"" story was too much. Then there were some characters that I didnt see the relevance as to why they were even mentioned (the other married couple that the husband was cheating, and the whole oldest daughter being pregnant story) I did, however, like the suspense toward the end, but the ending was a complete disapointment. Okay read, but wouldnt recommend to my friends."
3,"Good,But...........","This book was a good read but I felt that the author gives too many un needed details and she dragged the story out,I feel more than it needed to be."
2,disappointed,I had selected this book for my book club based on the great reviews. We ended up switching books after I started to read this one. It turns out it's just a romance novel. Not much to discuss with a book club. This book is good for a laugh...the characters are ridiculous. That's about it.
2,Weak Plot,"I bought this book because of the good reviews, but I was disappointed. It had a weak plot and was basically a silly romance novel. I finished the book but was glad when it was over."
2,Not what I expected,"I purchased this book for a book club and was expecting a mystery/thriller about a man carrying on a double life with a secret family. What I got is a ""romance"" novel disguised as suspense. Nearly every page describes some passionate encounter between characters, and stilted dialogue fills in the rest (the frequent product placements make me think the author is getting royalties). We actually chose a different book for book club, but if you're looking for a topical romance novel about cheating husbands, it might be a quick, fun summer read."
3,The *kayters* review,"Reginald Brooks is a big-shot with a marketing company who spends two weeks in Orlando and then two weeks in Miami - ostensibly for his job. The real reason is that he has two families. Neither one knows about the other. The first family with the wife he's married to, Tracy, lives in Miami. The second family, with his mistress Renee, lives in Orlando. As the story begins, Reggie has decided to come back to Miami full-time and give up his second family in Orlando. The book goes on to unfold multiple secrets that all come unraveled when Reggie decides to come clean.When I first started reading this book, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not. There is lots of gratuitous sex and quite a bit of cursing - not what I usually gravitate towards. But I perservered and I am glad that I finished the book. The ending (part 3) was worth waiting for. I didn't know what was going to happen and the ending totally blew my mind. Now I'm waiting on a sequel!"
5,Wow!,"This is one of the best plot lines I have ever read, especially the sex scenes, they were so hot! I'm still fawning over the private detective, Brent Stone! His attraction to his ""client"" was so electric and so intense, you felt the pages were going to catch fire and I just couldn't wait for them to end up in bed together. Quite honestly, I would read all of this author's books just for the sex scenes!The plot of Reginald's lie was equally as engaging and I couldn't have guessed it would end up the way it did with the mistress. All in all, this is a very interesting read. I could not put the book down until I finished."
4,real page turner,This book kept me turning the pages from beginning to end. The characters were fascinating and often infuriating. The plot was a fascinating idea that the author developed expertly. Some great suprises along the way this book is anything but predictable. A great debut novel and I can't wait for Ms Black's second book.
1,poochie rebel without a cause [stinks],"Ok, I got this cd for free and the only reason i took it was because it looked so funny i didn't think it could be serious. I was wrong. Apparently Poochie is serious about his music. Which is really too bad, because it [stinks]. Alot. Usually i think that bad music is funny but this is so bad that it isnt funny at all. This kid looks like he is about 14 or 15. It seems like every song on here is about Poochie ""being back"" Almost all of these songs have very stupid intros and the music sounds like it was made on a keyboard. It is very cheesey. Seriously poochie, you should just give up. This cd shouldn't even get 1 star it should get 0 but that isnt an option."
5,Amazing Stuff --others take note,Poochie's Rebel without a pause rules.There is obvious talent here - keep it coming pooch !!How many kids this age could be delivering the goods like this ??
1,What a load of old rubbish,but then if she's psychic she probably already knows what I think of her. Save your money and buy a good book on horse behaviour
2,Good for the city kids,"I was incredibly disappointed by this book. Of course, I have ridden, bred and trained horses since I was 10 years old. However, any fool who has every been around horses should have figured out everything Ms Solisti-Mattelon has to say in this book. That said, there are a lot o fools out there, so I'm sure there is a place for this book. Just don't expect great insight."
1,I hoped it would be better,"Jonathan Lear promises to treat one of the greatest subjects around; the relationship between psychoanalysis and philosophy. As a psychoanalyst who has also studied a lot of philosophy, this book seemed to have been written for me. If only! Lear has the maddening habit of never saying what he means, and instead couching all his thoughts in the most obscure prose. Reading this book is like wading through fog, or trying to follow a conversation on a crackling long-distance line. If only the apparent complexity was in line with the contents. But having just read the book twice from cover to cover, I can honestly say that Lear's conclusions are strikingly banal - and that he just expends vast amount of footnotes and bluster to reach them. Someone needs to write the book that this might have been. My choice is probably Adam Phillips, a wonderful British psychoanalyst, who I'd recommend everyone check out."
2,"Happiness, Death and the Remainder of Life","Lear's book had three chapters. The first chapter, Happiness, was depressing. In the second, Death, about all that happens is Lear attempts to replaces Aristotle's ""the good,"" with Freud's ""death."" It is the first time I have read about death without words like remorse, regret, sorrow, victory, or resignation being used once. Yes, I found the word guilt. The NY Times Book Review (Freud KO's Plato, by Richard Rory, Oct. 22, 2000) waxed on about the brilliant last chapter, so I read on. The last chapter, Remainder of Life, will have no consequences, impact or add new ways of thinking to my future, or anyone elses. Lear seems to know this stuff, but quoting others and referencing multiple sources does not make a good book, it is how you use the source material. The three chapters of the book can be summed up in three words, nothing new here."
4,Heartbreaking and beautifully written,"I picked up this book because the author wrote to my sf/f book group to introduce herself. I wanted to see what her books were like, and now I intend to seek out more. I expected the book to be like ""The Handmaid's Tale,"" but, though the themes were similar, I thought Marley's writing was more full-blooded than Atwood's (perhaps because she is more familiar with the science fiction genre). The book is beautifully written--Marley has a distinctive writing voice--and ultimately heartbreaking. I did cry at the end. The characters are subtly and fully drawn. Although not without a few small faults (I didn't quite buy Qadir's conversion), I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading thoughtful, thought-provoking science fiction."
4,The Terrorists of Irustan,"I found this book to be similar in many respects to Margaret Atwood's A HANDMAIDS TALE, and several books by Sherri S. Tepper. An excellent read, a book I plan to add to my library of women writers whose message is insightful and thought provoking."
4,Beautiful and brilliant,This story was amazing; Louise Marley gives a wonderful view into an alien society--which has its own parallels on Earth. I hope for a sequel.
4,Timely reading,"I would highly recommend this book and author. The book is very well written and despite its very serious subject matter, there are moments of lightness and humor.It's not the type of book you can easily say you ""enjoy,"" because the subject matter is dark and disturbing, but it is involving and compelling and thought-provoking.This was the first book of Marley's that I have purchased and based on its quality would purchase another."
2,déjà vu,"Not that the story is bad, but I was disappointed. Marketed as a fantasy novel, it resembles too much what we hear about the Afghanistan of today. I guess when I pick up a fantasy/SF book, I expect more subtlety in the treatment of ideas. This one was a let down, especially because I had liked her previous trilogy so much."
1,It isn't what it seems!!!,"I wouldn't bother ordering this bag, its advertised with a changing pad, when you recieve it there is no pad, and the quility is so-so nothing special. If you ask [the store] why you didn't recieve the changing pad thats advertised with the bag, they simply tell you if your not satisfied with your order send it back...."
5,Loved it.,Good purchase - sturdy and my niece even used after I was done.Matched the theme in my son's room as wlel.
5,Hats Off!,Great job! Arrived early and they were nicer than expected! I thought they would be used but looked brand new
3,Not as pictured,My straps were different than the picture.. not a big deal to some but it was kind of a big deal for me since I was using this to replicate movie props that required certain color scheme..great product anyway.. just not what was pictured with the strap color.
1,Buckle will break!!!,"Great frame, however it comes with a seriously flawed kidney pad. Particularly the release buckle is the source of the problem. YOU WILL BREAK IT in the first few tries to open/close it.You will need to get aftermarket straps, the kidney for sure.other than that it's great.1 star because it broke on the first try. In fact, me and my buddy got one each and we both broke the buckles INSTANTLY. when you get something and it breaks instantly, that's a 1 star product."
5,"Marine Tested, Marine Approved","This pack came in great shape, it looks like it was brand new! It is the exact pack frame that I had when I went through MCRD San Diego, only a million times better because it is not held together with tape! Can't wait to get up in to the Sawtooth Mountains and do some hiking with it. I have the medium sized pack and it fits on the frame great. Attaching the pack to the frame is a little confusing at first but is not to hard to figure out with a little help from Google."
2,Not as described....,"Shoulder straps...two different types, but didn't notice til they kept breaking. Had to use a snap link to keep it on, during a 22 mile trek no less. Frame itself is okay, hip pad not as thick/wide as a real one."
3,"Adequate frame, substandard straps","While the frame itself is perfectly adequate, the straps that come with it fall far short of the mark. They are very cheaply made and the padding is on the thin side. Worse yet, the quick release buckle won't cinch down on one side, so I've had to buy new straps from a better source.If you don't plan on carrying heavy loads and if you're willing to risk having to buy new straps anyway, go for it. Otherwise, just go ahead and spend the extra money now on a higher quality product."
1,Not worth getting,"My kids really love anything gummibar, otherwise I'd return it. It skips in the beginning and is short and not worth that price. I'm better off going on YouTube."
5,gummi bear dvd,"awesome. my 1 year old son loves it. every time he starts playing up, i just put on gummi bears and he calms down straight away"
4,very happy with Gummibar,I have a granddaughter that absolutely loves this video. She is very young and who knows she also maybe able to learn other languages with this video. Thank you so much.
4,Lots of Fun!,"While there are really only three different songs on the entire video, the Gummy Bear song is recorded in a number of different languages. The song is fun and infectious. My granddaughter just loves it and I have to admit, I do, too. I love to pick her up and dance with her to the music. You can only take so much of the video, but it sure is fun while it lasts. For those who complain about the cost of a dvd with a limited selection of music, I say if it makes the kiddo happy, it makes me happy, and is money well spent."
3,Gummy Bear Video,"Just not what I thought it would be. My grandson won't even watch it. In fact, when I took it out of the player, he told me it was 'junk, throw it away!' :("
2,Disappointed,"My son is 20 months old and absoutely loves the Youtube Gummy Bear videos so I decided to buy the DVD so he would stay off my laptop but I was disappointed. This video only features like 4 songs I know you are thinking but the product details says it has 11 songs yeah it does but its I am a gummy Bear (English), Cho Ka Ka O, Nuki Nuki, then I am a gummy bear 7 times in various languages such as German, Hungarian, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish...so that some 7 times in a row in different languages is REALLY boring and annoying follow that is the Cha Ka Ka O again but this time the English version and then Nuki Nuki (Short Edit). I wish it included the Futbol song and La La La I love you but it doesnt I was very disappointed."
1,I thought it was an album judging by the price.,"This was one song in about fourteen different languages, it should only be the price of a single then. I feel ripped off! They really got me cause I bought two of them. I saw it on utube and without checking I assumed that it was an album of songs."
3,Expensive and only a couple songs,"My baby does like watching this dvd but there are only 3 songs in english. Since I paid over 13 dollars, that is not a very good value. The other songs are just foreign language versions of 2 of the song. I was disappointed. The songs are catchy and my son does watch the video intently."
4,Great Information,"All in all, this is a great book on long term investing. Nick uses simple and true math to prove the points. I was able for the first time to fully understand dollar cost averaging and I now have a new view on bonds.Only problem I had with it was his 'voice' as he made comments about working with a financial planner. At times I felt as if he was calling me stupid if I didn't agree with him. He also didn't make ANY good arguments of why I should use a planner....his only point was they a planner will stop you from selling when you shouldn't. Guess what Nick, I'm a big boy...thanks.Again, it is valuable despite my one gripe."
2,EDITING FAILS,"Interesting plot, great actors - but poorly edited. The story meanders endlessly - much like ""The Red House"" (Edward G. Robinson)."
4,Nice product,"Nice price. You get what you pay for. The edges don't all tear perfect, but it's a fine product. I'm satisfied and would buy this again."
4,Exactly what I was looking for,"I needed a screw driver set that included torx bits, and this one had the right price (as cheap as many sets that didn't include the actual screw driver), had several different kinds of bits. Yes, its mostly taken up by philips and flat head screw drivers, but there's enough there to justify the cost for me. The screw driver itself was nice too. Comfortable in the hand, the gearless ratcheting system worked very smoothly and was easy to operate. There's a compartment in the handle you can open by unscrewing the back of the handle, which was a nice extra for carrying the bits you might need without carrying around the whole case. Speaking of the case, I liked that this one had a case that will comfortable fit into a tool box. Overall, I thought this was a nice set to have around the house."
2,"For Beginners, Perhaps","It's a mediocre, high school-level basic photography course peppered with a few 950 settings and tidbits you can just as easily find on the quick reference card that comes with the camera. All of the illustrations are in black and white, and, if the photos were actually shot on a 950, (which I doubt), they are so poorly reproduced here as to do the camera a disservice. The things you really want to know about a 950 are available for free on a variety of web sites. Are you a beginner? Buy a good photo basics book or two on lighting, the effect of shutter settings, etc. Buy one containing color illos and glossy paper while you are at it. Are you an experienced photographer needing to know about digital cameras, which resolution settings to use, how big a memory module to buy, which batteries to use, and minutiae about the 950 in particular? Search the web for some sites set up by 950 owners, and even Nikon's own. I almost never return books. This one went back."
1,A Short Course in Nikon Coolpix 950 Photography,"The book is spiral bound which is about the only high point about it. It describes very basic techniques which are displayed by very poor photos. The worst thing is that there are descriptions of color techniques/problems that are shown in black and white. Don't even bother ordering this book, it is a total waste of time and money."
3,"Some decent info for the beginner, but poorly printed","This book is self-published. In other words, Dennis prints the pages from a laser printer and then binds it. As such, the photos do not look that good. It looks to me like an HP PCL printer driver in the banding/speckling, so the photos look ""digitized"" and not smooth.Dennis, switch to a Postscript driver and halftone those graphics and photos. That would make the photos and graphics much smoother in the final print.Some decent info, but nothing earth-shattering here. I think the poor printing has turned off a number of readers, but the content is still OK, especially if you are a beginner. I have been shooting with SLRs for a while, so I was not that impressed, but it did have a couple of CP950 tips that were valuable."
2,Photo Class Manuscript,"Mr. Curtin's book looks like it was used at a community college photography class and then zeroxed poorly. The photos are pretty grainy for a book on digital photography. If you are using this book as a resource guide, subjects are hard to find. Granted, Nikon camera guides are often poorly translated and difficult to understand, but this book doesn't clarify a lot of things. For example, I use an off-camera Nikon Speedlight in a lot of my photos, and it took me 6 weeks to figure out how to turn off the built-in camera flash but still fire the external flash. I finally found the answer on the internet. If this book were selling for ..., it might be worth it."
5,A fascinating and informative study of the Texan,"Enhanced with an informative foreword by Kinky Friedman, Texas In Her Own Words as told by Tweed Scott is a fascinating and informative study of the Texan. Compiling interviews with people drawn from all walks of Texas life, Texas In Her Own Words includes commentary and observations from stars such as Willie Nelson, Darrell Royal, and Liz Carpenter; a wealth of fun and interesting facts of the great state; illustrative pictures vividly capturing the pride of many Texans; the origin of the Texas image and attitude; and discussion points for diehard Texans or book groups study the history and culture of the Lone Star State. Texas In Her Own Words is very highly recommended for its concise analysis of Texas pride and its wonderful in-depth coverage of every given style and stereotype of Texan."
5,There is hope,"What can I say? Like Lee Smolin, I too am a recovering mathematician, and this book helped me out the trap. I love mathematics and majored in it at university, but soon fell prey to the seductive sense of omnipotence comes with thinking that one can manipulate reality with equations. I give this book my highest recommendation, especially for those who have become demotivated by the crisis in science. One condition though - don't read it in isolation. Essential companions are Peter Woit's ""Not Even Wrong"", and my own book ""The Virtue of Heresy - Confessions of a Dissident Astronomer"".The Virtue of Heresy: Confessions of a Dissident AstronomerHilton RatcliffeAstrophysicist"
4,I knew it....,"Always knew physicists made things up to suit their sensibilities. I knew it 25 years ago - Balanced particle creation, beautiful theories. It all smacked of too many special brownies. Always bothered me as I pursued my education."
5,The Trouble with Physics,"I am still wondering why theoretical physics is behaving like it is doing...losing the essence that characterizes the scientific method. After reading this delightful and incisive book, my only concern is to know how long it will take to string theorists to accept we are following the wrong way...as physicists. I just wish this book captivates as many honest people as the honest author desires."
3,Two parts,"This book has two different parts: the first one is vibrant and, even if I did not agree with many of the author's statements, I enjoyed it. You can find some contradictions and doubtful assertions, but it is so lively and well-thought that you cannot stop reading it. You realise that, often, believing in a theory is a matter of how it is told, because I do not think that more than 0.01% of the readers are able to know if the different arguments (pros and cons) are really valid. Really worth reading.The second part is devoted to the way science is done, and how to improve it. In my opinion, this part is very weak; the way the author justifies the success of the Copenhagen interpretation is unacceptable; the promotion of alternative theories, difficult to justify; the situation of investigation in Europe, idealized. The good thing is that this part is shorter than the first one."
1,Kindle Version is Faulty,"I downloaded the free sample, and was impressed enough to buy the book in a Kindle edition. It downloaded (after a long time) to my Kindle, but was unreadable, and wouldn't download successfully at all to my iphone. Amazon ignored my on-line plea for help. A few days later, by telephoning the Amazon help desk, I was told that the file was faulty, and that I would be issued a refund, the Kindle version of the book would be withdrawn from the Amazon website, and the publisher would be contacted to prepare a new Kindle file, which might take months. None of these things has happened yet, a week later. Doesn't Amazon test Kindle files before putting them on sale?"
1,Only for cynics,"People should be able to research what they want and not be ridiculed just because they have some clever ideas. My professor is from Harvard and paid more attention than this author and he is a string theorist, and should not be ridiculed. From my personal research on the subject I feel that the aspects string theory I have focused on are very likely because they explain alot. Does that mean I should be ridiculed? If you don't like something, forget about it and write about something you understand."
3,Decry the String Theory,"Lee spends a lot time explaining why the string theory may not be a valid approach to atomic structure, but doesn't in my view claim one for himself."
3,Confusing but fun on my Kindle,"This is a facinating book. I am an engineer, not a physicist. Therefore, I am not fluent in the language. I look up words. I found that Smolin is a controversal person probably with both or several groups of other phusicist. He refers to other physicists as friends, but when I searched for information about him I found that he like other physicists often disagree, which should not be surprising in research and theory exploration.I have not finished the book for several reasons, but I am reading only this book plus daily the newspaper. I'll give another review when I have completed it."
4,Interesting read,I got this book because I had read a book about string theory before. Now I don't know much about physics but this book was an interesting and easy read.
3,The String Snapped,"Lee Smolin, a fair-to-middling popularizer of physics vents his anger at himself and others for pursuing the chimera of an 11 (or more) dimensional universe and a ""theory"" that produces 10^500 distinct theories. Unfortunately for the reader, Smolin manages not to define his terms, and gives no clue to how this number of 10^500 was arrived at, nor even what a distinct theory means.The book is almost solely interesting for its treatment of the sociology of string theory and the way its practitioners monopolized high energy particle theory for much more than a decade."
3,Hard for me to read. I prefer mystery stories.,I am not enthralled by this one. It was purchased for something to read and I read it when I am not graced with another book or the internet connection...
3,doesn't mean it is a medium good or bad book,"I'm wanting to understand my universe better but at age 57, much of my current upgrading comes from the history and national geographic channels. I'm only 45 or so pages into the book and I read it in doses... I just barely follow all of the references to all of the theories and their details (sometimes I feel I need to stop and read a book about each subject quickly and then return). I appreciate the purpose of unification and it is basically why I am reading this book. I will finish this book and be glad I did but as reading is recreational and thinking on this level is closer to hard work than fun... there is just enough content to keep a motivated reader (me, who wants to better understand the universe) moving slowly through the book."
3,Fair,"This is a complex subject but the author does tend to go on and on and on. Make sure you have an intense interest in the state of modern physics or you will never get through this book. Not saying it isn't a good book, just for special tastes."
4,The Trouble with Physics,"This is a mature, unbiased and informative analysis of an important aspect of science that is generally hidden from public view. It is also an enjoyable read."
2,Review pending. 2 stars after reading 24%.,I've only got through 24% after three weeks. It takes a real nerd to get through this stuff. And to think that all I wanted to understand was string theory. HA! Big question is should I apply the 30% toss rule.
4,Refreshing,"I taught university physics for 36 years and I found this book to be a refreshing analysis of both the history of breakthroughs in physics and the confusion of recent years. The discussion of the reverberations of successful unification theories was especially enlightening. In a discipline that right now is rife with tons of speculation, it is not often one finds a practitioner who is willing to acknowledge troubles in the camp."
4,Nice review of limited area of physics,"I found the book of interest and a worthwhile read. You should have some background as this in not intoductory material for first time readers in this area. At times the book becomes tedious, particulalry when the authour deals with his concerns over the current state of physics. I don't fault his view or positions, they were convincing and logical, but judicious editing would have helped the reader and reduced the redundancy."
5,On the nature of physics departments in the US,"This is really what the book ultimately is all about. It is a physicist who has invested his life into tackling the big problems out there, which is what I'm sure every freshman physics major plans on doing with his PhD in 8 years or so. Smolin comes down hard on String Theory, but rightly so it's become an overly fashionable and sensational topic that is dominating science currently. I agree with the authors' point that the physics departments out there at the University need to be more open minded with what they allow to have studied.I would recommend this book highly because I felt it was one of the best books on science that I have read. You may not agree with Smolin, I had a few disagreements with some of his topics but over all I can see the point he is making needs to be taken more seriously so science can be done properly."
5,Very cool watch.,"I got this watch from a box of watches my dad bought at an auction for $28.00. I first passed it over expressing an interest in a gold-tone Invicta but revisited it. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was solar powered and set by the atomic clock. I cleaned it up and downloaded the user manual and was impressed with the features the watch has to offer. The wave ceptor feature even works in our apartment which is constructed of block. As of the date of this review, the watch was set last night at 4:05AM. Another thing that really impressed me was the luminous material used. The watch hands and the indexes glow quite well all night long. I don't really worry about the mineral crystal getting scratched because it is inset and well protected. I am 6'3"" and 215 lbs and the watch wears quite well on me. I would like to get the polyurethane strap for the watch. Overall, this was a great find."
2,big.,"I bought this watch as I liked the feature set. That said, I found it to be way too large for me (I'm 6 foot tall, 170lbs so skinny) and on my wrist, just looked funny. I did end up with another Casio with the same feature set (Forester) that fit my wrist much better."
1,"Buyer Beware. This is oversized, bulky and strap may need prefessional adjustment","This item is much bigger in reality than the online picture lets on. It feels very heavy when you wear it. When I got it I had to have a jeweler resize it for me. I tried myself but it is more complicated than implied. I am not a happy camper at all. I have long been a fan on buying online but I guess you have to be careful when buying watches online. I never make online bad ratings but had to make an exception for this. Please, buyers beware."
3,the watch is too bulky,dont get fooled by its looks.Its not sleek as shown.The dial is heavy and looks like a miniature football field on ur wrist.Except that all the features are very good for the price.Would recommend to those with huge wrists.
4,Casio G shock atomic solar stainless steel watch,"This is a good looking watch that can just about survive a atomic blast. It's a very heavy and thick watch but thats what makes it a G-Shock, all the extra padding and things that make it virtually bullet proof.I like the analog/digital layout and as long as it picks up the WWV signal it will keep perfect time, plus the colored dial with all the stainless just looks great, almost a dress watch.If you want a watch that looks great, is hardened enough to wear to any work situation, and is large, this is the watch for you."
4,Form over Function...,"It's a very stylish watch and I get compliments on it all the time, but the display for the functions like stopwatch, alarm, and date display are small and hard to see. Also, the date is off and I haven't been able to properly set it."
5,Solar Atomic Casio Watch,"The watch is certainly large and makes a statement when you're wearing it. Very masculine and although looking like a quality timepiece, doesn't look overly glitzy and bright as a cheap watch will quite often come off as. I like the automatic light for night time viewing, or when in a theater or darker area. With the sun charging the battery, there's no need to try to save energy or worry about the battery running down. I liked the red in the dial but the blue might be nice too. Easy to take links out once you figure it out and the technology just amazes me."
3,"Just realize it's a pamphlet, not a book.","It was cheap, so I can't say it was mis-priced. While I don't agree with the author 100% about everything, she raised some good points, and I felt I learned/grew my faith a wee bit by reading this. It's also, being compact, a nice piece of prayer encouragement that you can keep with you.Just beware that you aren't exactly buying a ""book."" Note the few pages (20? maybe? I should check....). And the ""book"" has similar dimensions to a tract or deck of cards. This is truly a pamphlet. Useful or worthwhile, possible, but nevertheless a disappointment to someone expecting a book."
2,Not very useful when the examples are written in RUBY!!,"There's a lot of why and what but almost no ""how"" here, unless you want to learn a language called Ruby. He doesn't even give much in the way of Ruby code, either. It's mainly a lot of complicated program diagrams that look like an ad for Visio. If you want to read ABOUT code generation, buy it. If you want to see actual code generation, skip it.Sorry, I can't jump on this bandwagon."
4,A good introduction to meta-programming.,"I had already written a few code generators when I saw this book and was hoping to find some insights into improving and extending what I had already done. The introduction gives a really nice overview of the designs patterns you can use. But this book is not about programming and the author assume you have the skills to implement the program you want to meta-program already.The author illustrates his approach using a language I had never heard of before, Ruby, which is an OO scripting language that is quite compact and powerful and included is some basic tutorial info in the appendices to help you follow the examples. Overall a good book that I am glad I own and have read. I get the feeling I am going to go back to it many times."
5,"Beautiful, an oldy but a goody","This book is just plain beautiful. Every page, every sentence. It's about a beautiful little girl who talks about her involvement in their garden. The pictures are so pleasant, the whole tone is so calm. It should be on every child's bookshelf. I love the fact that the little girl just looks like a normal little girl in pink sweatpants and cute little chubby cheeks, and isn't a child model. Love love love! It's a classic."
5,review,Great movie.....you get to see some pretty famous people very young....we just love most movies that have Goldie in them....thanksDarrell
4,Great Comedy,I watched this movie on TV the other night and had forgotten how funny it was. Hoping to watch it with my granddaughters.
2,Never received,"I ordered the DVD in November for a present. The DVD never came. The company is suppose to issue a refund, but I have not verified that as of yet."
1,Umm corny?,"I wasn't expected much from this movie.One Sunday afternoon I got bored. So I looked for a movie to watch on TV. Wildcats was pretty much the only thing that jumped up at me. Turns out its a cliche football rags to riches female doesnt get taken seriously till they all hug at the end when they get to the championship. It maybe predicable because of my age (20) and I've seen really good football films...(Friday Night Lights, Remember the Titans, Rudy...ect) But this was not a good movie. Decent would be pushing it. If you are expecting a football movie...dont waste your time."
5,"Good movie, Good price","This is a good deal for this movie. Price was cheap, quality of movie was good, shipped quickly and arrived undamaged. Not too much more you can ask for when buying something online."
5,Love this movie!,"I have watched this movie many times.Owned it on VHS for years and always wanted to replace it with DVD.Now I have.Great comedy, woman-power and perseverance wins."
4,it shows women CAN do it all.,"this is a positive influence on men and WOMEN, it shows women can do anything, coaching a bunch of losers like the wildcats back to humanity is a hard thing to do. but she did it! Goldie Hawn is always an inspiring actress in any role she plays. she will always be my favorite. (ANYBODY KNOW WHERE I CAN GET A COPY OF THE SONG ""FOOTBALL""?) i cant seem to find the soundtrack anywhere. please let me know at"
5,"Football is cool, even for girls.","A great, lighthearted comedy with serious undertones as Goldie plays a high school track coach who wants to coach varsity football, but the men won't let her. James Keach is the evil ex-husband who uses her daughters as pawns in an effort to get her to give up her crazy dreams. A cast of notables in supporting roles includes Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson in their first movie roles, Nipsey Russell as the principal who believes in her and Bruce McGill (D-Day from Animal House) as her arch-rival, coach of the Prescott Falcons. Look for outstanding, underappreciated performances by unknowns Dave Kanakas and Dave Nieker as Goon #1 & Goon #2"
3,"Sharpe's Gold, Spain 1810","Lieutenant Sharpe and Sergeant Harper of the 95th Rifles are detailed to recover Royal Spanish gold from Spanish Guerilleros. The British Army numbering less than 30,000 men are poorly supplied and are at their last lines of retreat in Portugal. Viscount Wellington in overall command of combined Portuguese and British forces personally emphasises to Sharpe the dire need to fund the fight against the esitimated 350,000 French armies, recovering the gold is vital.Sharpe outwits Spanish guerilla leader Jovellanos, retreating to Almeida where a massive unexpected gunpowder explosion destroys the Cathedral (which was used as a magazine) and fortifications. Sharpe escapes to Portugal and Welington, the gold funds the defensive lines ogf Torres Vedras. Marechal Massena is halted 30 minutes from Lisbon."
2,Amazon customer review policies are idiotic,"Currently, I am enjoying working my way through all of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe novels. Simplistic good versus evil adventure stories with a few twists, entertaining with minimal intellectual challenges. Nice historically based novels with afterwords by the author explaining where he took some literary license. I highly recommend all of Cornwell's work to those who enjoy this type of adventure writing, and most emphatically for those in high school, or those seeking similar reading experiences at a later age.But let's get to the title of this review. Amazon asks us all to review products almost as soon as the purchase is made, often before the purchase is received. Therefore there is no review here for this particular novel, because not only have I not yet read it, I haven't even received it.So to whatever moron at Amazon who is responsible for this policy, do us all a favor and resign."
5,Very Satisfied,"Shipping was fast - product is sturdy, easy to clean, and holds just the right amount of water for a 2 hour work-out. Easy to carry by the connecting strap bottle-to-lid. Much better than re-using the flimsy desani bottles. Hopefully, this is avoiding the chemical issue in plastics."
1,*sigh*,"First and foremost, if you are interested in a good book on a comprehensive study of Bagua, Park Bok Nam is the way to go. This book however, all I can say is, if you are more interested in just (random) applications and learning something that goes in the complete opposite direction of real Bagua, fine, then get this book. But just remember authentic Bagua is alot smoother which can make it more effective for defense along with creating greater health benefits and coordination.I have been told Erle has excellent Taichi stuff, I guess its true. But like some of the other stuff of his I have checked out, he seems too tied up with dim-mak applications and san-shao to the point that you forget what it is you were originally studying."
1,Bogus Bagua,"Ok someone must have blown up a fish market because something stinks! Not even suitable for a new student of BaguaZhang, and here Erle is claiming his book to show a ""complete"" system of BaguaZhang? HA! Fat chance. So what does this book have going for it? Some basic application and dim mak points are shown, but on some little kids? Just what is Erle suggesting BaguaZhang was used for? I shudder to think. I have always questioned Erle's background and credibility, I think the so called""expert"" and ""secret"" information he shares in this book more then answers any question about him I my have had in the past."
4,Another great book from down under.,I just read the bagua book and I am now looking for a teacher! The information shows the whole bagua system and not only one part of it as others have shown. I was amazed to find that bagua is a real street fighting art and the deadly strikes to dim-mak points are awesome. What intrigued me was the linear form which I have only ever heard about in the past but which has now been published for the first time. It will take some time and effor tto actually learn the linear form. So it is also essential to have the video tape on this form. I use the book as back up when I am not near a vcr.
3,Humm,"At first I was disappointed; these screwdrivers look cheap. Then I had occasion to replace a light fixture in the bathroom. The magnetic tip held the screw, making my job easier. The tip seemed solid enough as well--at least it didn't round off with the first turn. Not bad."
4,Workbook/Studyguide Vol. 1 for Destinos,"This workbook is an excellent expansion of what is learned in the Destinos Student Edition text. At the time I ordered the workbook and text, I thought I would be receiving the CDs that are referred to in the workbook. These were not included. It should be made clearly that CDs for the text are different from the workbook. It should also be made clear that the CDs for the workbook have to be purchased separately."
1,Destinos Workbook/Study Guide Vol 1,Workbook had many test questions answered in INK. Does not allow me the chance of testing myself.TWO PAGES OF OFFICIAL ANSWERS TO TEST QUESTIONS WERE RIPPED OUT. UNABLE TO KNOW IF MY ANSWERS WERE CORRECT.

3,Old dead footballs,"I was pretty peeved to find that there was one small piece of Leather and the rest was a dimpled football style hide I believe to be from a pig, it was totally useless to me so I gave it away to a guy down the road who uses it for grease retainers for trackters."
2,Cheap but ugly,"When I received the item the leather had damage where it had been folded. Another area had been crimped from when it was tied up with plastic bands. There were nicks and blemishes on the other end of the piece. The piece itself was also smaller than expected, approximately 10"" x 37"" of workable space before subtracting from the areas with damage.I had bought these pieces to be used as paddle strops for some straight razors, but any significant defect of the face would render it useless. I'm going to end up trying to smooth the back down enough that it can be used but that's going to be more time and effort than I was expecting to put into what was suppose to be a simple project.TLDR: If you're looking for a piece with a relatively smooth surface do look elsewhere."
4,Good price and service,"The thick belly leather scraps came on schedule and were as advertised. The backs are pretty rough, but they worked well for the projects I am using them for. The price for this thickness is excellent."
5,Never Thought I'd Fall in Love With a Trash Can...Until Now.,"I bought this trash can 1 month ago and I'm so glad I did. Love the color, it totally brightens up my kitchen, and it hides the bag completely!I've read other reviews (for different colors) that have complained about the ""large"" plastic hinge in the back. It sticks out 3 inches or so in the back so you can pick it up easily. It's not a drawback, in my opinion and the hinge is not flimsy at all. Not sure what the big complaint is there.It was cheaper when I bought it a month ago (July 14) at $109. (including shipping) and it was totally worth the over $100 price tag."
5,Better Than I Imagined,"This garbage can is far better than I imagined it would be. I love the color, the construction and size. Although I must admit, it was a bit taller than I had thought it would be. We actually don't really use the mechanical foot opener like I thought we would, we prefer the handle on the lid. I debated on spending good $$ on a garbage can for months, but I'm so pleased with it that I wish I had gotten it sooner."
5,PoolGuard,"So far, I really like this alarm. It was easy to set up and place in the pool. It is very easy to dis engage the alarm and take out of the pool for swimming. My pool cleaner (Kreepy Krawler) has not set it off. The house alarm goes off and on with the outside alarm. The alarm is not too loud but loud enough to hear it in an emergency. We have a freeform shaped pool and I was concerned that the wave motion would not activate the alarm in some circumstances. That has not been the case. We tested the pool with several gallon jugs tied together (about twenty lbs worth) and the alarm always went off. It is the waves that sets off the alarm. If you have wind action that gets your pool into a wave motion, this alarm will drive you crazy. We have terrible wind here, but our pool never gets wave action going during wind storms so it has not been a problem, so far. My only complaint is that I wish there had been a second key to turn off the alarm. If I lose this one or my dog eats it, then what?"
2,In Ground Alarm,"I've installed inground alarms for customers. Pool Guard is the easiest to set up. I mount the alarm on 12x12 paver, so you don't drill in the deck. As much as the manufacturer says there are fewer false alarms, my customers tell me of false alarms. This the better of the less expensive alarms. Buy a door alarm and a pool fence."
2,Not a transcription of Dylan's harmonica.,This book contains a transcription of Dylan's melodys not his harmonica solos. Besides that the lyrics were not included making even playing the melodys a challange.
1,Should have paid better attention to the reviews,"If when searching for this book you typed ""Bob Dylan"" before you typed ""harmonica"", this is not the book for you.It isn't the quality of the book that is at issue -- that seems fine. It's clearly the choices that were made -- most notably the aforementioned decision to transpose all the songs to C. Anyone who wants to learn to play harmonica, even as simply as Dylan does, will probably be willing to buy more than one harmonica -- and changing the keys renders the ability to play along with the records useless.Changing keys (to make it easy for piano I guess) is a common problem with simple music and tab books. I usually only buy books that say ""Authentic Recorded Versions"" on them -- and even then I am often disappointed."
3,Dylan Harmonica Music,"A great collection of Dylan songs. The harmonica pieces are easy to understand and are shown in numbers as well as the proper music. The were no words on the sheet music though, so it can be tricky to find out where in the song you are."
3,"Carnegie Hall on November 14, 1952","Love You MadlyThe music on this CD was recorded at Carnegie Hall on November 14, 1952. During his long career Ellington played many prestigious venues including Newport, Theatre Des Champs Elysees, and The Royal Albert Hall, but perhaps the most important venue for Ellington was Carnegie Hall. Starting in 1943 and continuing for several years Ellington would stage concerts at Carnegie Hall to showcase his compositions and his soloists. Many of these concerts are groundbreaking. However this one is not a groundbreaking concert. The sound quality is only fair, and the only long piece is ""The Tatooed Bride."" (The version recorded at Ellington's November 13, 1948 Carnegie Hall concert is superior.) There have to be atleast 15 or 20 CD's of Ellington's concerts which are better than this one. For completests only. Dizzy Gilespie shows up on ""Body and Soul."""
2,The usual blah!,"I used to like this band, very much. They started off as a sort of French Duran Duran poppy band, that later evolved into a French Depeche Mode with darker sounding themes and sounds. Unfortunately, you don;t have to listen too closely to notice that all their tunes begin to sound alike. Even as my French is a joke, I can almost make out the way their songs go at first listen, as the grooves are well worn in their capacity to compose new music. As far as the lyrics or vocals go, same thing, and equally as disposable. I will be disposing of most of my Indochine CDs in the near future, but I will still keep my Duran Duran and DM albums. Their best albums? ""Danceteria"" and ""Nuits Intimes"". Alice & June is just repackaged, rehash with some frills as consolation prize."
2,Another disappointment!,"For 30+ years we (our families) looked forward to the Claxton Fruit cakes during the Holidays. Last year we bought several and even wrote the company about the poor quality (no response back). Decided to try again this year, bought one today, it looked fresh. Worse than last year!! Dry, burnt tasting nuts, no flavor...total waste of money!! I am a retired food mgf. and it sure shows when you cut costs and forget what built your business or maybe lost the secret recipe. So long Claxton...it was nice knowing you (back when)!"
5,Super delicious fruitcake,This is chock full of fruits and nuts with just the right amount of sweetness. It is perfect with a cup of tea.
5,fruitcake,a little disappointed in price as my local grocery store sells these for apporx $4.00 each meaning a total of $20.oo not $32.00. Cake itself is very good quality.
3,Too many words,This book is very dated and the style of writing reflects the era of writing as much as the author I suspect. It is very wordy yet has some interesting comments. I did not like the assumption that Christianity represents the pinnacle of religious evolution.
2,disapointed,"i saw this guitar and thought it was so beautiful. i thought it would be a nice cheap guitar to pack around with me, and it wouldn't quite matter if anything happened to it, because of it'a lack of cost.on the day of the estimated arival i got a letter saying that the guitar was out of stock and they had to recieve more. on the day of the second estimated arival i got a letter saying that they were once again out of stock, and that the item would be cancels within the next ten days and to redeem this item call back. i allowed the item to cancel, then called back ten days later to double check that it was canceled. i assumed the money would return to my account since i hadn't reseived anything. they never returned my money to me, and i never got a guitar. i originally ordered the guitar over a month and a half ago. as pretty as the guitar seems, i dont suggest ordering from this company."
5,Great non-greasy sunscreen,"I was first introduced to this sunscreen by a fishing guide. It is a clear gel. I immediately liked how it seemed to ""dry"" on the skin as you rubbed it in. There was absolutely no greasy residue what-so-ever which is a huge pet peave of mine with sunscreens especially in a beach environment where sand sticks to anything. Not so with the SmartShield Gel. It is a little on the pricy side though and difficult to find hence purchasing it here on Amazon."
1,Worst Laptop Ever!!!!,"I have an Aunt and an Uncle that work for Compaq, so I got this computer relatively cheap. I was very excited when I got it because at the time it was one of the fastest on the market. About three months after I got it, it started shutting off whenever it wanted, more and more frequently, and the fan WILL NOT STOP, even when the CPU usage is below 3%!!! I sent it back, not once, but twice! Same problem over and over again. Now my warranty is up, same problem... Do you think that Compaq's customer service would help me or my family members that worked for them?? NO. Not only does it still shut off all the time, but the cd-drive is burnt to hell... cant even read a cd-rom. Guess what else? The floppy drive wont work either. All I can do is type in MS Word for about an hour, thats it. I would never reccomend this computer to even my worst enemies. GET A DELL. SERIOUSLY."
1,Brick Heater,"This computer is very heavy. The screen is cheap. Battery life is an insult (90 min at best). The computer gets so hot, it puts my oven to shame. As others noted, the fan rarely turns off and is as loud as a leaf blower (I can't take a nap with laptop on). And of course it is always shutting down, or shuts down when you try to power it out of hibernation. I used to think it was a problem with one of my drivers, but from reading these reviews and seeing how ubiquitous the problem is, its obvious compaq dropped the ball on this one."
2,Not funny,"4 months after I bought my presario it started shutting down suddenly and the fan went crazy! I can't play any gamez or use the modem for a longer period of time because the computer crashes....Overheating problems with any application...It's just standing on my desk and the fan works all the time...why do I have 2 buy a cooling pad when I spent such an amount of cash on this thing...I owned a presario before, but i have never had such problems....Oldies but goldies......They should print a warning for hot surfaces while working with this notebook...Use it only as a typewriter because buying a home cinema is more effective and cheaper in order to watch a DVD!"
1,useless!,This book is completely useless.Try instead any yoga breathing book.The writing style is very annoying.No information.Save your money.
5,The Breath book I ever read!,"Anyone who is interested in reaching their full capabilities as far as vocal performance NEEDS this book! packed with tons of insight, explanations, and unique exercises, this book is sure to have you holding out notes until the end of time... (well OK maybe not that long) but still! Metal, rock, R&B, Reggae, in fact ANY genre of singing all rely on basically the same thing... support! And mastering your breath is the first step in allowing you to sing effortlessly and truly enjoy singing =) Grab this book today!"
4,Good breathing workout -- useful for learning to engage the right muscles,"I'm an advanced beginner who's been taking voice lessons for about 4 years now. I found ""The Ultimate Breathing Workout"" very helpful and would definitely recommend it. The tone of the writing is annoying, there's no question about that. I appreciate Jaime Vendera's enthusiasm, but his self-promotion and goofiness start to grate. In the end though, it's in the exercises he describes that the value lies. The exercises were helpful to me both in strengthening my breathing and in making me aware of the muscles I needed to engage. He proposes certain exercises (such as holding your breath) that other writers (Richard Miller for example) dismiss, but nothing he suggests seems dangerous to me or too wacky. Likewise, I've found that his workout provides a very useful singing warm-up as well."
4,Great Workout!,This book combined with Raise Your Voice is awesome. The workout is kinda intense at first but you get used to it. Its really the best way I've seen to make quick improvements.
1,Allergic Reaction,In my mid-fifties I developed an allergy to 14 and 18 carate gold. Now it's a few years later and I can't use many sunblocks because of the chemicals that deflect the sun's rays. My derm. recommended using a zinc oxide base and it's great. Well it now appears that I also have a problem with something in Source Naturals Skin Eternal. While my issue doesn't negatively reflect on the product I thought someone might benefit from my experience.
4,Very impressed,"I have been using this product for almost a week. I only use it in the mornings, but may start using it at bedtime. So far, I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles around my eyes and the deep furrows I use to have between my eyes, are much less noticeable now. I'm very impressed. I have rosacea, so wasn't certain how I would do with this. So far, so good. It doesn't make my face red, which is a plus and it seems to be helping my broken capillaries on my cheeks and by my nose. I'll give an update in a month. I'm also going to try it on some broken capillaries on my leg and also some scars and see how it does. Good product."
3,It's OK,This is a rather heavy creme that doesn't have a great aroma. I purchased it to use on my hands and arms and one jar doesn't last long and (at least with my chemistry) it doesn't smell great.
5,DMAE cream,"I purchased this product as a smaller travel size to keep in my overnight bag. I like the product, it feels silky going on and moisturizers well. I got it initially because the skin on my forearms was thinning some, and getting flaky. It does seem to have helped. I only wish I had used it sooner! If you have it on your fingers though, keep them out of your mouth! Tastes nasty!"
5,I have been using this product for a few years and I love it.,"I was laid off for a period of time and couldn't afford this face cream, I noticed my skin did not look as fresh. Once I was able to use the cream again, my face once again felt fresh."
3,Its Ok but nothing spectacular..not as advertised..mostly hype,"I have some sagging starting to show around the jowls, and some wrinkling/crows feet, to be fair I just started using this cream three weeks ago, SO FAR...This cream is just ok... Its claims are mostly hype, however, when using it at night before bed, my skin feels nice in the morning, but as far as repairing wrinkles and sags.. sorry guys its not the answer, and Ive tried em all.... the one thing that has helped the most is facial strength training.. its time consuming, and most of us want a quick fix, me being one.... while I had some down time, I decided to be faithful with the facial strength training, and those results were pretty good, but you must keep at it, and I dont have the time.. also... DMAE is a good supplement for the skin with sags, but taking it internaly is better, and you can go to health stores, buy your own DMAE make your own cream very inexpensive, and add much more DMAE to your cream with much better results"
3,Not recommended,"First off, I love Source Naturals products. The Skin Eternal cream is wonderful. I bought this because of the DMAE (even tho Skin Eternal has it in as well) and also bought the DMAE Serum (see my seperate review of that -- horrid stuff). It's not as creamy as Skin Eternal and the smell is more like a cotton candy smell. The serum burned my face and made it itchy...I took it off immediately. Then I tried the cream -- no bad reaction to the cream. It's just so-so. I honestly prefer the regular Skin Eternal cream as a better night cream. There are other products to remove brown spots. Beware of this one. Like other reviewers, I DO NOT have sensitive skin. The only other time I had a reaction like that was when I was a teenager and tried a Mary Kay product (never again!). This contains tree nuts and soy. I have hay fever, so that may have been an issue. I can't say I'd recommend this."
1,disapointed,Not what I was expecting at all and really I don't think it helps my skin any. Just a cream nothing amazing.
5,Removes brown sun spots,"DMAE cream really works! I have used it to remove all of the brown sun spots that I picked up after spending the summer in Florida. I think it is also plumping up fine lines. I used two differently labled DMAE creams by this same company. They both worked, but this seems the better of the two. Also, a little goes a long way."
2,greasy,"When I first used it, I thought the greasyness would disappear, but it did not, and I added and my makeup and it balled up, don't know if this would work, I have stopped using it, and I even used less rubbed more, no way, could this enter your skin."
2,No difference,I'm 30 years-old and have been using this product for about a month. I haven't noticed any change in my completion at all so far and am not sure how effective this product really is.
4,An excellent compendium of stimulating reading!,"I found the selection of short stories well-chosen and nicely balanced. Cleverly written and imaginative, none failed to please. Stimulating and enjoyable, this would make an excellent ""pillow book""."
3,Okay,"""Historical"" is not, perhaps, the best way to describe this book. The stories use different time periods as their settings, with the preponderance of them focusing on either the Victorian period in England or France during and after the ""Terror"". Most of these are quite good. One of the best stories, however, is the tale entitled simply ""Garden"". This story goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden (not an historical period, but never mind). ""Garden"" is deliciously heretical, with hints of sexual awakening. The book turns inevitably to sadomasichism. This is due to the fact that one can only write their favorite words for genitalia so many times. Some of the stories are merely poorly drawn character studies where the author takes forever to get to the real business of erotica, if they ever do. Some of the tales fail to meet the ""wet test"" altogether. Recomended, as long as you don't mind skipping stories."
5,Supberb!,"No long description of this book is necessary, just trust me.....it is a book you will not put down till you finish it!... I have an extensive collection of books written about the Holocaust and this one is one of if not the best. I began to read it and I immediately was drawn into the story and could visualize what the author endured so very long. No matter how good a book is there are usually a few dull moments or something like that, but this book honestly never did. Each page, each word was brilliant! I read it in just one day, there was no way I could put it down. So I recommend this, do not begin the book until you have a free day and then begin it in the morning and let yourself enjoy it without having to be interrupted for work, school. etc.I would really like to thank the author for this incredible book!!"
3,"Good lighting, excellent shots of Morgan's anatomy!",The best part of the whole movie was the undressing sequence of Morgan in the bathroom and the bathing sequences - excellent! Not much acting but great body shots of MF! I would watch it again just for that!
2,"Morgan gets nude, Stevens acts weird and not much else","This ""thriller"" is a waste of time unless(and yes i did enjoy them) you want to see Morgan Fairchild nude! the only other ""good"" thing in this mess is a fine job by Andrew Stevens as the ""stalker"" who looks nice and has women chasing him. You feel for this man who has lost his grip on reality and hope that the young assistant who loves him can reach him and pull him back from his madness. I don't think that making the victim seem so snotty and crass and the sicko so likeable is what these movies are suppose to do."
2,only 2 things I liked,"I didnt know what to think of this movie when it first came out , I played hooky from school and went to the mall and went to the movies , and saw this one , I just sat there dumb founded and wondered why arent the cops doing anything , Then again there wouldnt be a movie would there lol ?The only 2 things I liked in this Movie are Morgan Fairchild and the idea she finally shot and killed the freak at the end .The very idea that a mad man /rapist can be reduced to a child is not all that strange , I can see anyone mocking a jerk and reducing him to nothing , then again it could piss them off and make matters worse .I like seeing a woman carrying a role where she is NOT the victim but the heron and finally Morgan Fairchilds character did that .BTW I do remember hearing the song for the theme in this movie and recognised it as Dionne Warwick , but can someone tell me the name of the song and where I might get it , it may be the 3rd best thing I liked about the movie lolCiao"
2,"Boring, B- -",Hijust a short scene with some t&a; from Morgan Fairchild nothing else worth mentioningRegards
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"This movie is HORRIBLE. In fact, when I think of the ""worse movie ever made"" I think of this one more than 20 years later.Worse yet, it was the first movie the local theater charged the then-unheard of four full bucks admission price for (before then movies at night were three fifty). I felt violated after paying four full dollars to sit through this ""thing,"" like the wimpering fool crying at the end of this atrotious film.Junk. Garbage. Trash."
5,Good Book,"This book is very informative, it covers all the basic wood turning tools and know how. I would recomend this book to anyone starting out on a wood lathe or just to get a refresher course."
4,Raffan - Turning wood,"A good basic introduction to the selection, preparation and turning of timber. Green and seasoned wood is dealt with and many aspects of spindle, face plate (bowl) and cup-chuck turning. Richard Raffan is a world renowned master of the lathe and has an engaging and easy to understand manner. Close up shots and clear focus of the turning process is a feature of the DVD / lesson material. This is a sound, well prepared and presented introduction to the craft of wood turning, tools and timber. I have been turning since 1982 and purchased this to brush up on some bad habits and found it most useful."
4,This was a very good book !,"This book was really good . It made me want to keep on reading,but the thing I don't like is that it has the normal Sabrina stuff . I also recomend Age Of Aquariums ."
3,Ok but should have been called 'fair wind',"It wasnt as great as 'Showdown At The Mall' or 'Prisoner Of Cabin 13' but it also wasnt as bad as 'Dogs Life'. Reading the title of the book makes you think its all about the prom when realy thats all talk untill the last chapter, what the book is actually about is a fairwind spell. The fact that Sabrina keeps been taken out to buy dresses gets boring after a while, i think this book is actually at its best at the beginning fading out as you go on. But i wouldent completly rule it out its written very well and i like the story line. I think it was better than 'Age Of Aquariums', i think all the Weiss' books seemed to drag but this was a good one."
5,Work Fine,"These tees work well, haven't broken one yet. I've still got all of mine except for the ones I've forgotten on the golf course.I'm no pro, but no noticeable difference in distance between these or any other tees."
1,First swing - snap!,"First off - these other reviews are fake. If they are truly unbreakable, why do they sell you so many?My first swing, SNAP!"
3,golf tees,they look good but i haven't tryed them yet because it is winter sorry but i will try them this spring
3,Unbreakable (Not Unbendable!!),"The item was exactly as described!!! It did not break after a bucket of balls at the driving range...However it did bend after my first tee shot... I rated this a 3/5 because it was a decent item, but the bending of the tee makes it kind of hard to hit from. I was able to bend it back in place (Sort of), but I kind of expected a little more. Just be aware that this occurs."
4,"Great tees, just one problem...","...they dent instead of break.They're great tees, don't get me wrong, and I've yet to break one in 2 years. Sometimes they get lost when they ""bounce"" backward (""regular"" wooden tees do the same thing, or they just break) and I can't find them, sure. That's not a product defect, that's an eye defect (or what I call an ""I-defect""). Although the tees themselves don't break, they do dent at the point of impact (the widest part of the tee, where the ball sits). I'm not good enough to tell you whether the tiny height/tilt difference has a large effect on my shot, but I can imagine why it WOULD to someone else (after all, each tiny dimple has an effect, right?). So that's the only reason I don't give this product 5 stars."
1,sad sadder and saddest,Hi i refuse to give this book a worthy so called star. it doesn't deserve it. you'll want to sell the book before you even finish it. before you buy it check at your local library first. it is a book i took out of my collection and trashed it. it wasn't worth my time and i'm sure it won't be worth yours either. it was just about judith going to all these guys. personally it reminds me of someone from where i came from. don't fall for the book it's not worth anyones time. Thank You.
4,Will tug at your heartstrings!,"In post World War II Palestine, Judith is dead and her son Zayde inherits something from each of his three fathers. Moshe, the first of the three fathers, hires Judith to care for his two children when his own wife dies in a tragic accident. Globerman, the cattle dealer and the second of the three fathers , falls in love with Judith when he comes to do business with Moshe. Sheinfeld, a canary breeder and the third father, believes he has a relationship with Judith when, in fact, he doesn't. Who the fathers are and the extent of their relationships to Judith and Zayde are revealed as the story is told.Shalev is most magnificent when he describes the pioneers of Israel as individual characters. They are colorful, quirky, and strong. Again in this book, the author uses the splendor of animals and nature to create a rich, complex story. It may seem confusing at the onset, but all pieces fall into place in the end and the vivid imagery lingers long after the book is closed."
5,must read,"I won't add to the description of the book, I just want to add my praise. This is the 3rd novel I have read of Shalev's and he is a great Israeli writer. Up there with Yehoshua who I also enjoy and respect tremendously. Try Shalev's other books, Blue Mountain and Esau, and Yehoshua too - especially Mr. Mani, the Late Divorce and the Lovers! Beautifully written and great stories."
1,Not Recommended,I really didn't find this book helpful for me. First of all most of the techniques are too general (i knew most of them already). Then it shows too many plug-in filters that I don't have. And It only shows the final image in colour.

4,Daredevils of the Red Circle,"I am enjoying the old time serial movies from my childhood!! these were made in 1939 and are pretty much stereotyped in their acting skills, especially the fist fighting sequences. None the less, it is entertaining.I doubt the younger generation would like them, but to me they are classics!!BES"
2,Just as poor as a 2 year old OEM battery,after fully charging it lasted about 5 hours in the phone before going dead. Pretty poor life. I'll be sending it back as we already have 2 poor batteries.
1,battery,"this batt- don't buy dosen't last only about 1 hr tops not worth money, dont waste the time i sent one back and got 1 more it was the same bad"
2,Lenmar Cell Phone Battery,This replacement battery does not hold a charge as well as any of the original batteries that were branded. They work but hold a charge for less time
5,8 Great Little Stories in 1,"I loved this book. Eight different stories rolled into this one book. Some are funny, some sad but all are interesting and exciting. I thought this was a great idea. These short little stories are perfect and don't drag on when a single cowboy start outs on a trail to keep from the dreary details."

3,Jamie Anderson - Blue Music,"This album is perfect for the clubs: the beats are crisp, the production values excellent. Jamie Anderson is a great craftsman of tech-house. The album doesn't work as well, however, in a more personal setting (with the exception for tracks like ""Puesta Del Sol"" and ""In Two Minds""). That said, the music is like a flashy-dressed guy that you see at the club: fun to dance with, but boring once you take it home."
4,Like talking to a friend,"I am reading my way through this book. It's been great to receive confirmation that a lot of the things that I'm doing are right on. There aren't too many people I can talk to about Asperger's Syndrome. This book gives me ideas and resources that are quite helpful. Another home school mom actually referred me to this book. Asperger's Syndrome is a fairly new diagnosis, so I expect that more will be known and written about it in the next 10 years."
3,Good for Parents new to Asperger's,I didn't find it as helpful as I thought it would be because I knew a lot of the information in the book. I passed it on to an acquaintance who is currently homschooling her son and she is pretty sure he has Asperger's even though he has not been diagnosed. She has not returned the book so I think that she has found it helpful. For someone who is new to Asperger Syndrome and needs a starting place this is a great book! But for someone more seasoned this will just be a review.
2,a 2 star movie.,"i don't mind if a gay movie doesn't have any sex.but when you don't have a kiss between the 2 main characters. you are asking for 2 stars. it is little mixed up the end meeting the beginning. but i like that in a movie. there is suicide, attraction,(because i can't say love) and outer space."
3,A Dark Yaoi Murder Mystery,"Big Bang Love, Juvenile A is a dark story of mystery that is set in a dark prison in a strange land of pyramids, rainbows, and a rocket ship. The photography is beautiful. The action consists mainly of poses, extreme violence, and interrogation with the occasional tender moment between the two main characters. It was good practice for my Japanese."
1,Incomprehensible,"This is someone's deep gay fantasy, and they are lucky that they got the money to make this film -- lucky, because it could have only been made based on luck or favors or someone willing to sleep with someone else. It is even subtitled in English, although I'm not sure why, because I can't see that it would make any sense in any language.I thought this was going to be an artistic, dreamy, sensual, mysterious film. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. It is a one-time-only, head-scratching extravaganza that goes nowhere. There are hints that there are dark, disturbing things that are going on, and if the creative team behind this had taken those elements and made a compelling story out of this, they might have had a cult classic. But they didn't and they don't.I will be interested to see what other Amazon members have to say about this film, if in fact anyone else has purchased it."
1,don't bother,"firstly, this faucet is gorgeous. I love the design. But it is faulty and doesn't work. I spent money installing, then fixing and then paying for return shipping, TWICE on these. First I thought it was just my piece that was defective...water comes out in a very tiny stream. returned and reodered again. same problem. this time i had a plumber drill a larger hole somewhere inside as instructed by danze. waste of time. had to return it again. sorry but please don't buy it. unless you want to take a chance because you're so tempted by the look...:) hope this helps"
3,ONLY FOR DIE HARD FANS,"BRIGITTE BARDOT was not a much of an actress, not much of a singer. However, she managed to make the best of the two.If BRIGITTE was your boyhood fantasy dream, then this is really for you, because everything is there. The key songs here are the one SERGE GAINSBOURG wrote for her(L'APPAREIL A SOUS , JE ME DONNE A QUI ME PLAIT and BUBBLE GUM were the early ones);all the others(BONNIE AND CYDE, JE T'AIME MOI NON PLUS,CONTACT,HARLEY DAVIDSON and COMIC STRIP were recorded in 1967.Everything else is of doubtfull interest.For the same price, you can go to your nearest zoo twice, and even give food to the seals."
2,Biased account by one of Bowie's snubbed hangers-on,"This shoddy biography is written from Zanetta's (a Warhol-related actor who eventually lost favor with Bowie) point of view. Bowie is painted as a largely talentless, moronic crybaby as his worst moments are explored in monotonous detail. Bowie fans will be incensed"
5,KANK,"This movie evoked very conflicted opinions by Indians, as it addressed a subject that is not only fundamentally taboo in Indian society, but would never be talked about openly. The story is about a girl who married a family friend but finds real love afterward, which ultimately leads to adultery and the break-up of two marriages, along with its impact on the families. Although not the first movie to broach the subject (Mahesh Bhatt's Arth, and some others come to mind), nevertheless, the movie was a bold move by the Director Karan Johar, who is otherwise known for his opulent and grand productions. The movie made a moderate amount of money in India (it was a ""Hit"") but in the Indian Diaspora it was a blockbuster and the combined returns made it a top grosser in its year of release."
2,Wrong CD,When I bought this CD I sincerely hoped that it would be the first volume of the collection that I had as a child. Details such as a tracklist or an image where completely left out so it was literally a blind buy. But at least there were some of the songs I liked. And for the price it wasn't so bad either.
2,Too Basic,"I found this video to be too basic to serve the needs of the professional massage therapist. I recommend instead A Complete Guide to Practical Reflexology by Melva Martin, N.D., M.Ed which provides a comprehensive tutorial on the principles of reflexology, and superb instruction on treatment technique."
2,Very Basic,"As a massage therapist, I was looking for something more in-depth than this video. It is definately for the beginner, and gives info only on the bottom of the foot (the organs and glands) and the hands. It shows nothing about the top of the foot or ankle and what that corresponds to, and only once gives any warning about working certain areas of the feet."
5,Practical Solutions to a Pressing Problem,"Managing Einsteins is right on target offering creative approaches for dealing with the high-powered thinkers and doers in the workforce. The book is easy and fun to read, and clarifies why many managers fail to optimize the potential of their highly intelligent employees. Technical managers from CIOs to IT Directors will find specific action suggestions based on research and knowledge available on Einsteins. The practical advice offered and the insights provided are ready to use. I enjoyed the book and recommend it to Einsteins and non-Einsteins alike."
1,Not for technical managers,"If you somehow became the manager of a development team from a completely non-technical background you might like this book. Otherwise, if you are in any way technical yourself and now find yourself managing technical people, this book will bore you to tears by repeatedly stating things you already know - high tech workers can't be judged by the timeclock, giving them fancy titles doesn't make them want to work for you, etc."
2,No Managing Einsteins in Here,"Although the book has some good management ideas, it lacks an ""inside"" view of the real ""einsteins."" Even the Einstein concept is too narrowly defined--The authors define ""Einsteins"" as computer nerds. Unfortunately, it also promotes the idea of ""them"" versus ""us""--the ""Einsteins"" versus ""normal"" people, repeteadly reminding the reader that the authors are ""normal."" Yet, they chose a serious, scholastic tone that is probably hard to grasp for the ""normal"" person, and boring for the ""Einstein."" NOTE to the publisher: Get a really nerdy looking guy, put a picture of him in the cover and have him write a book: How YOU Can Manage ME."

They were exactly what I envisioned when I purchsed them."
1,ok set if you could use it,the colors of the screwdrivers are the only good thing about this set the plastic handles are really rough witch makes them feel like they are going to cut your hand i used dollar store screwdrivers that had better handles. other than that i cant really use them because of the casting of the handles.
3,"Life-long learning, not factual learning.","This is an easy book to read. Ideas are presented in a lucid style. I think there are some good ideas in this book but I think you should be aware before you buy the book that it is referring to learning skills and new habit patters, such as those needed to curb overeating (which is well explained) rather than learning facts like languages and formulae. I think that the message is more about life long learning, which may be what you want. You will learn about ""ganus"" and attitude and excitement in learning. I think that it could be an interesting resource to have in your collection of self-help books, but I am not going head over heels about it!"
2,Learning to Learn: Maximizing Yuor Performance Potential,"I have seen quotes by this author in various places on the web and was very impressed by them. I am sure she is a dynamic presenter. This book is pretty much a rehash of just about every aspect of the New Age movement. It might open doors for newcomers, but it lacks the specificity and the uniqueness of which I think this author is capableDr Bil Hawkins"
5,Demonic Toyss.. Toys killing people!,"I like fullmoon movies. I gave this movie five stars because from all of there movies actually this one is one of the better ones. If you enjoyed puppetmaster you will enjoy this one. They have Demonic Toys 2, which just came out like a week ago."
2,very weird,The movie was mostly pretty slow and it didn't have much of a plot. It was kinda cool at some parts like when then the toys would attack but there wasn't many original deaths. Overall if you really like horror movies it might be interesting but if your looking for a real thrill you probably don't want this movie.
1,Demonic Toys,"I couldn't make it through the whole film without turning it off. Not because it was scary, because it was extremely stupid. I laughed at times where it was supposed to be scary. Entertainment value? Yes, if you're looking for a comedy."
3,The Second Half Has Potential,"Don't get me wrong; the first half drags as we watch a bad version of Flashpoint playing out. (Officer down, and she doesn't use her radio/walkie talkie/communications device/radio in the car to call for backup?) After an agonizingly slow beginning, though, things begin to look up. It's refreshing to watch this woman actually try to use the telephone she is standing right next to. Also, the protagonists do bother to take some extra ammo and reload their guns from time to time (although in a key scene you would think a double barreled shotgun had six or eight shots instead of two.) The second half is much more interesting, although my mind boggles at what they missed. How about stuffed bunnies that fly at you, wrap around your face, and suffocate you? The ending was quite intriguing, so I can't really write this one off altogether."
2,Not worth it,"I think these movies were written by 13-year-olds FOR 13-year-olds. I was about that age when this came out and I loved it. It was so cartoonish and I would think ""I can't believe they said that"". Well, I rented it again all these years later and I could barely sit through it. Who produced this anyway? A killer toy movie? It is very low-budget and boring. Two stars because 6th or 7th graders might like it."
1,SKIP IT,"ONE OF THE BADEST FILMS I SAW IS DEMONIC TOYS NO PLOT,REAL ACTRESSES/ACTORS,NO GRAPHIC VIOLENCE OR GORE,NO SUSPENSE OR HORROR,JUST A BORE TO WATCH IT STARS A DEVIL KID POSSESSING TOYS AND KILLING PEOPLE IN A TOY WAREHOUSE..."
3,A Devil,This Full Moon horror flick features a devil in the closing segments. Not a bad feature for horror fans. Animates toys to life. Has a scene of brief nudity.
3,These Toys Make The Perfect Christmas Gift!,"Demonic Toys starts out fast and fun, and for a while I felt like I was watching a lost entry in the Child's Play series. However, about midway through the movie lost me with some dumb satanic stuff that just changed the tone of the film.Demonic Toys is entertaining enough for fans of killer doll movies, but it's not as good as any of the Chucky movies. Even Child's Play 3 is slightly more enjoyable than this. Rated R for graphic violence, some nudity, and lots of swearing."
1,Horrible design,This seat is the worst. It is bulky to carry around when dining out or just going to a relative's house. My 20 month old drops half the food he eats and we are bringing it outside to hose off and pick out the remains of each meal. I am looking to replace this seat with something a little more child friendly. Definely will not recommend it to any mom.
2,Probably better for a really big baby,"I bought this booster in place of a high chair since we are limited on space and our first daughter was really big for her age--so she used a booster early anyway. Since the second daughter is on the small side, this really big booster is still too large for her at 8 months, so although she is almost walking, she still slumps in the chair. In addition, the playthings on the sides are too difficult to use for a baby small enough to need a tray. On top of that, there is an unremovable bar between the legs that my toddler will not stand for, so I have found this one all but useless.It sounded like a good idea, but I think this one would have been better used only occasionally at Grandma's in stead of being our daughter's only booster at home."
1,Horrible Highchair,"Like many others, I thought this highchair would be great because we do not have a lot of room in our apartment. This highchair is impossible to move (the different seating positions), take apart, and clean. My son is one now so I don't really want to but another highchair but I think I might just so I can spend more time with him instead of cleaning this ridiculous highchair!"
1,Get something else......,"This is my first review ever, but I had to share. I bought these for my twin boys thinking...two highchairs - not enough room. I now have two highchairs. The seats were not rated overly poorly when I bought them, and most of complaints centered around the toys being useless, which they are, but it didn't matter to me because my boys were going to be eating in them, not playing with them.... The problem is that they recline on their own. I have them at my mom's house for them to eat in because they were SO tough to clean - as one reviewer said, the food gets into the strap holes and you can't get it out. Now everytime I put the boys in there they recline. The sight of them trying to eat tipped back is cute and all, but EXTREMELY annoying when I've fixed the dumb things 14 times in 5 minutes. You have to take the baby out to put it back upright only to watch as it slides back into recline position. I wouldn't bother if I were you....."
2,This chair was a mistake,"I bought this chair for my 2nd daughter to use instead of a highchair. We have a small breakfast room and were trying to save space. The chair was fine while she was young, but now that she's a year old and feeding herself, the food gets stuck in the holes in the seat and it's impossible to clean. I spend an hour the other day spraying water into the holes and food just kept coming out of this thing - it's disgusting!The recline was great for an infant, but now I can't get it to stay upright! I keep adjusting it and it slides back to recline after I put the baby in it. I'm throwing it away and buying a new seat...."
1,It broke the first time that I used it!,"The first time that I put my 3 month old daughter in it when I started feeding her cereal, she snapped the middle peice that goes between her legs. It makes me scard as what she will do to it when she is 6 months. I bought it because it was the cutest and it was good for an infant because you are able to tilt it back pretty far (unlike a highchair). My first intuition when I opened the box and put it together was to return it, because the peices didn't look like they were going to firmly stay together, but I didn't, and now I wish I did. My advise is to buy the cheaper, less attractive booster seats because they seem to be more worth the money than this one."
1,HORRIBLE,"Do not waste your money!! I would give it negative stars if I could. This seat is impossible to adjust, I was never able to. My 6 month old son kept scratching his legs on this seat, and you will never be able to get the food out of the cracks. We took ours back and bought The First Years recling booster seat and we all like it a whole lot better. Stay away from this seat."
1,I wish I had read your reviews!,"We have been using this chair for almost a year and have already decided that our second child will have a ""real"" highchair. We liked the idea that our daughter could be close to the table, but had no idea that the booster would be so difficult to clean; the amount of food that gets stuck in there is disgusting, and I didn't realize I would shaking the trapped food loose every day. The reclining feature broke after only a few uses and now the tray latches are so loose that one smack from our toddler and the tray goes flying. While I'm sure this booster seat is good for an occasional meal, I do not recommend it for daily use."
1,missing a part,I recently purchased this item only to get disappointed by the product . After I had put together I noticed I was missing the middle part that holds the tray together. Prior to purchasing I noticed another box that looked like it was returned but ignored it...now I can see why it was returned it probably was missing the same part . I am on my way to return this product
2,Traps food!!,"We bought this chair for our 18 month old so our six month old could start using the highchair and this seat loses tons of food! Once a week I remove it from the chair and shake tons of food from beans, to cantaloupe to cereal!! I clean this seat all over after every single feeding and no matter what the food gets dropped in the holes and you CAN NOT get it out! One week after we bought it we saw a very basic booster seat at Target for 10 bucks that we should have purchase instead! Sure seems like we wasted $20!"
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought this for my son after my sister-in-law said she bought it for her son and liked it. It has done well for us except for the past few weeks he has figured out how to push on the cross-bar thing that goes between his legs with his feet, and the whole tray and holder falls off. I find that it can be very dangerous if you don't have your child strapped in. And along with what all of the other reviews have to say, it is hard to clean and the recline just sucks!"
2,"works, but has some problems.","Like the previous posters mentioned, this seat does have some problems. You cannot adjust the recline if baby is in the seat. The food gets trapped where the straps connect in the bottom of the seat and you can't clean it out. Our son has thrown up while in the seat and it's impossible to get completely clean. The toys are really cheesy and aren't very entertaining (might as well not be there IMO).The seat works ok, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since there are other similar products out there that have gotten better reviews."
1,karen,"I have bought lots of baby items, and have been through many high chairs. We hated this chair. Frst of all, the toys are stupid and the baby could care less that they are there. Second, the chair kept slipping out from the sitting up position. My son would constantly be reclinig. This made the tray not level, and all the food to run together. The worst thing about this chair is that food gets stuck in it, and there is NO WAY TO GET IT OUT!! It is really gross. We had to stop using it, becuase both my husband and I could not get that food out that had been there, who knows how long. There are much better high chairs on the market. Please, skip this one!!!"
1,Bad design,"The good: Sturdy tray, can adjust seat to different angles.The bad: almost everything else. We have the same problem everyone else mentioned with the strap holes that collect food. It's just disgusting. Another problem is actually putting the tray on. Not only can it not be done with one hand -- it's sometimes very difficult to do with two! I can see this being a good chair for an infant just starting solids or as a booster for an older child, but it's terrible for self-feeders just starting out."
4,Great chair,"We bought this chair for our now 6 month old son and we love it. It easily attaches to our dining room table chairs and allows our son to eat at the table with us. We use the tray when he is in it, which keeps any food from getting places it shouldn't be. The toys on the tray are also fascinating for my son. He will outgrow them someday, but for now they keep him entertained while we finish getting his meals together. We also love the fact that it will be a booster seat at some point, so we won't have to buy a new seat when that time comes. It was a bit difficult to get the pieces snapped in together when assembling, but we figure that means it won't fall apart easily. Overall we are very satisfied."
1,The healthy care booster seat is better,"I had this for exactly 16 days. My then 16 month old was sitting in it, eating corn and pieces of chicken. Well you can imagine most of it got down in the holes where the sealtbelt comes from, and it - wow it was just gross."
5,Meets every need!,"This chair is amazing! The recline feature allows small infants to sit in the chair. My daughter has used it since she was 4-months old. We placed toys on the tray and she would giggle at them. At age 3 she is still using this booster. The height adjustment feature is great because as she gets taller the chair can be made shorter. I like the stability of the chair. Even when fully reclined it was not prone to tipping. The chair goes camping, out to restaraunts, to family gatherings, etc. It serves as a place to keep my child busy coloring as well as for eating.I now purchase this chair for every baby shower I attend! The moms love it and everyone I know who has one has no complaints.If one thing could be changed about the chair it would be to add a padded seat of some kind because the hard, slick plastic can be a problem at times. But I simply place a dish towel or small blanket under my daughter and she is fine."
5,Simi Valley,I have really enjoy this reclining booster. It takes up less space than a high chair and our son is very comfortable in it. He is almost one years old and has been using it for 8 months now. We're glad we purchased it and would buy another one!
2,Food gets lost in chair,"We originally picked this chair because it could be reclined to different positions and it takes up less space than a high chair. The concept is great, BUT a huge complaint is that the safety strap is coming from the bottom of the seat and not the back of the seat and food gets stuck in the seat. The only way to get it out is to pick it up and shake it like crazy. Or, stick a napkin in each hole (one on each side). That's what I did and it works well, it just stinks that we bought this chair with the greatest intentions and it's one big food trap! I still recommend this type chair over a high chair when you're trying to save space and money, but just look for one with straps coming from the back of the chair versus the bottom. I don't recommend this particular chair for every day use at all."
1,I'm returning this today,"I bought this chair for my small kitchen thinking it would be a great space saver. I used it only once and have realized it is awful. It was very hard to assemble and very cheaply made. The first time I put my 14-pound daughter in it it fell to one side because the height adjustment is weak. Just resting my arm on the tray caused the tray to pop off. I can only imagine how dangerous this chair would be when she is bigger and climbing, escaping, pounding her chair."
1,Very difficult to clean,"I have to echo the sentiments of those who said the holes in the seat allow every kind of food imaginable to become trapped. It's very annoying. And the straps present just as big a problem for cleaning. My 22 month old loves yogurt and cottage cheese but is messy with it. The straps often get dribbles or large globs of food on them, and you can't remove them to run them through the washing machine. So they have some very disgusting stains that I can't get rid of. This seat is going away."
3,Impossible to clean!,"I agree with the other reviewer-it's impossible to clean! I had to put the chair in the tub to clean it. I then banged it several times to get the trapped food particles out. After that there was food still trapped! It's to much work for a booster seat. The design flaw is the two seatbelt holes, everything gets caught in there.On a positive note, my son has been sitting in it since before he could sit on his own. I like that it can be used reclined, straight, higher or lower. If it weren't for the holes I would keep the seat, but my 10 month old son is to messy, and the seat is to much work-off to the thrift store it goes!"
3,It's O.K.,"My 5 month old son loves to sit up and is going to start eating solids soon. We've been debating over high chairs so when I saw this I thought it was the perfect solution. I usually read reviews about products before purchasing them but in this case it was an impulse buy at the store. Oops, wrong decision. It's a big plain plastic addition to our kitchen and because it's cheap plastic it doesn't fit together well. I'm sure that if we kept this until my son was larger and stronger he would be able to push the tray and front attachment right off.I'm going to return this one and try the Healthy Care Booster Seat. The reviews seem to be much better for this product."
1,Do NOT waste your money!!,"I wish I had read the reviews before we purchased this chair! While it looked perfect for our small, NYC apartment, it turned out to be horrible! The plastic is cheap and rough...my 5 month old son scratched his heels on it and had scabs for a week! It's a pain to clean and the ""crotch"" strap is so low, it doesn't prevent him from slipping forward when he tilts his hips (even in the fully reclined position). When I called the company to complain about the plastic being rough, I was told to ""put socks or shoes on my son's feet while feeding him!"" That was not an acceptable solution for us!! DO NOT BUY THIS CHAIR!!"
1,"Don't waste your money, isn't all that great","This worked really well for my son as he was starting solids and we reclined him in the chair to feed him, but that's the only time. It was a waste of $30. Now that he is 10mo. old we threw the seat out and bought a Healthy Care Booster Seat. It works great. He could sit in the other one, but was constantly putting food in the holes in the seat. You can't take it apart to clean the area so you have to shake the seat and hope all the food falls out. It isn't very easy to clean at all.And when you take the seat off the chair you keep it on, there is food that has spilled out stuck to your chair. The Healthy Care seat doesn't work that way. You can wipe it all off and put it in the dishwasher. There are no holes for the little ones to hid their food for later:) It also folds down to take with you when you go somewhere. It costs around $25 in the store. Don't waste your money on this one."
1,Waste of money,"I had to write about this in hopes someone else does not get stuck with it! Our daughter is 9 months old now, and feeding herself; I agree with other reviews in that EVERY bit of dropped food gets stuck in the holes. I got so frustrated because I could not clean it, I removed the screws to try to take it apart to clean...but it still does not come apart where it needs to! I am going out today to buy a highchair, and I am extremely irritated that I wasted my money on such a piece of junk! (who designed this thing anyway!!??)"
1,What a waste!,"As the mother of twins, I was looking for an easy, portable solution to feeding time when not at home. This seat is not the answer! As indicated by the other reviews, the seat is not comfortable and both of my twins fuss in it making feeding time much more difficult than it has to be. In addition, the seat itself is just too big for a small baby and both of my children fall side to side, unlike their full sized high chairs which gives them much needed support. I wouldn't recommend this seat at all!"
1,Hard to use!,"This seat looked great in the box but my husband and I are returning it. Putting it together seemed simple, but it was difficult to snap the back and the t-bar together. Once my husband got passed that, adjusting the hight and reclining angle were even more difficult. Stay away from this seat unless you want to be frustrated."
1,health hazzard,"i bought this item because of the price and it was the worst choice i ever made. food gets stuck in this chair and there is no way short of banging it on the floor to get it out, even after banging it around a bit there is still food in there. it must be a health hazzard. DO NOT BUT THIS!!!!!!!!!"
2,Need help!,"I purchased this booster seat for one of my granddaughters. She's 16 months old. Food falls into the seat and goes in the openings for the straps. We have to ""hose"" it out each time we use it! I wouldn't purchase this model again!"
2,Frustrating,I baught this chair for its nice design and because I didn't want one of those bulky high chairs. It seemed pretty convenient also because it reclines. Although you need to get a hang of that reclining option (can be pretty tricky) it was very useful when my daughter was just a few months old. Then I realized that since the seat itself doesn't have a padding (the back does have one) the holes for the safety straps are wide open and any food that falls off the tray goes automatically in these holes (it's like a law of physics!!!). It makes it extremely hard to retrieve even impossible at times (we end up with a nice colony of ants!). My daughter is almost 18 months old now so I guess I'll just be patient instead of bying anything new. But I don't recommend that model unless you like frustration.
1,Food Trap,"Food gets stuck in the chair! I try to use the vaccum hose with attachment to get it out but I can't get all of it. I think that is just disgusting! I thought the reclining feature was nice but my daughter looks very uncomfortable when I recline her in it, she is 10 months old and very capable of supporting herself, and it still looks uncomfortable. I don't know why they advertise these things for newborns anyway you shouldn't be giving your baby solids until they are 4-6 months old."
1,Terrible,My husband and I did not like this booster. It was very difficult to adjust. Food would get stuck in the holes where the straps come out and it was impossible to retrieve it. It got stuck in the reclined position so we finally got to throw it out and get a new booster seat!
1,Just got rid of it!!!!!,We couldn't seem to get the food out of the holes in the bottom. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM..it was a waste of money! Just because it looks nice doesn't mean it works nice!!
3,does it job of saving space but..,"I really liked the chair for the space saving measures but food does get stuck in it. I literally take the chair and shake and bang it then use my faucet spray to clean it out. My friend takes hers outside to hose it out. Also the toys on the tray don't work well, we ended up taking them out and tossing them in the garbage. I can't compare it to other similiar chairs but other then the food getting buried we haven't had any other complaints. It's really grown with our daughter and we'll use it for our new baby"
2,AZMOM,"I registered for this booster to save space and so that we could take it with us when needed. This is the most difficult chair to adjust and you have to take it off the chair and adjust it on the floor with assistance and force. Food gets stuck and is not easy to remove from the slots where the straps come out of. Daily I have to take the booster outside and shake the excess food out of the holes, which means once again detaching it from the chair. There is no chair covering for this booster and we have tried using a towel to catch the excess food, but it is not helping. Save your money or somebody elses, this booster is one big headache and inconvenience. We should all be able to get our money back."
2,Buy something else,"I wish I would have read these reviews sooner. I registered for this to save room, I should have gotten a regular high chair to save the headaches. There are two big holes where the safety straps come out of and one big hole where the bar goes down between my sons legs. Once the food goes in there is almost no getting it out. At least once a week we have to take the chair into the shower to blast the food out of the holes. I have tried filling the holes with paper towels, my son pulls the paper towels out and eats them. I have tried putting tape over the holes, this only causes a distraction, my son in more interested with peeling the tape off then eating. The chair is also very difficult to recline, and forget about trying to adjust the seat with your kid in it. Don't wast your money."
1,HATE IT!!!,My son recieved this chair as a birthday gift. We already owned a similar chair but this one seemed so much nicer. We were thrilled to recieve it until we actually used it. It is very difficult to clean. Food gets trapped in the little holed and even when we shake it out some food remains trapped. My husband takes it outside and runs the hose through the little holes near the straps and that usually does the trick. After he hoses it out we leave it in the garage overnight to dry. Keep in mind that if you purchase this chair this is a every night routine that you can look forward to. Prior to recieving this chair we were using a Fisher Price chair that was not nearly as attractive. We bought it for 10.00 at Kmart. The 10.00 Kmart chair actually comes apart and can be put in the dishwasher which makes cleaning up as easy as can be. As for this chair do not waste your money. More expensive is not always better and this chair is proof of that.
1,Impossible to Clean!,"This seat has holes in the bottom of the seat for the lap belt. Food falls into the holes and because the seat doesn't come apart, the holes can't be cleaned out. Disgusting! What a waste of money! I bought the Eddie Bauer seat for ten dollars more and have been happy so far with the removable/washable cloth seat cover."
1,YUCK!!,"Other than the convience of having a small booster seat, I would not recommend this product. Food gets caught in the holes where the straps come out and it is impossible to get to it. Even if you shake is out after every meal (which no parent has time to do) the liquid or softer foods get stuck. The base does not come off and that is where most of the nasty stuff gets to. I am throwing mine away and going to buy a better seat."
4,Perfect for small apartments,"This chair is great if you have no space for a full size high chair. My 5 month old daughter enjoys sitting in this chair. I have it tilted slightly because she cannot sit fully upright yet. It is easy to clean; there are no little crevices where the seat meets the sides (unlike another brand). The chair is very sturdy on my kitchen chair, which has a little padding. I also like that it is wide - more stability. It is hard but not impossible for me to tilt so I am not worried that it will move while my daughter is sitting in it. We don't use the tray yet because my daughter is rather small, and I don't care for the toys."
2,NOT AS GREAT AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE!!!!,"I purchased the All in One Reclining booster for our 2nd son who is 7 months old for 2 reasons I have an older son and his bulky high chair was always in the way and he out grew it so fast, so I purchased this thinking it would take up less space,and he would be able to use it longer Well I was right about that but that's it.. This is the worst design I have ever seen, the back rest doesn't stay in place and it pinches his arms. The tray is the worst part of all it won't stay on very well and sometimes if my son moves to much the tray will fall off!! I would not have bought this if I had known how poorly made it was. I was not pleased at all. THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!!"
2,Impossible to clean!,"The concept is great, it is perfect for small homes and easy to cart to grandparents houses - however it is virtually impossible to clean. Food - I am talking about HUNDREDS of Cherrios - gets caught in several holes and gaps; you cannot take it apart to access the area under the seat where the Cherrios, etc. are hidden. My son is ten months and we haven't even begun the heavy duty self-feeding. A friend has the First Years brand and can put the whole chair in their dishwasher - straps and all. So unfortunately there may be another highchair purchase in our future!"
1,Waste of money,I can't stand this chair. When I hooked it to my kitchen chair it constanly came loose and slid around. It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean. The little holes that the belts come out of are like the abyss for food. Plus reclining the seat was virtually impossible. It is not convienient for taking it to restuarants either. Don't waste your money.
2,crumb picking 101,"We selected this item feeling that it was ideal due to its reclining positions and neutral colorway. The neutral color was the best aspect!Problem 1) The seat tilt slips back from the position that you select.2)The seat has two deep openings that the safety straps come out from... an ideal place to catch crumbs if you like that sort of thing! (and it is awkward to clean them out daily)3) The tray does not position itself or stay on wellOther than that, its great!"
1,Don't buy this chair!,Don't buy this chair unless you feel like cleaning out trapped food after every meal. I purchased this chair for my second child after using a similar one with my first. The old one you could remove the bottom easily so clean up was simple. This chair is awful. After every meal you find food in every nook and crany and it is almost impossible to clean. I have a hard time adjusting the chair and often have to wait for my husband to fix it. It is simply my least favorite baby item purchase. It is very obvious the designers of this chair do not have a one year child. Most days I feel like throwing the chair threw the window of the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this product.
1,Awful,This thing is awful. Difficult to change positions and even worse to clean. I can't wait to get rid of it.
2,"Good concept, poor design","I purchased this booster seat for my 14 month old son. He is learning to eat on his own and is very messy! Inevitably food falls onto the seat and gets trapped in the large gaps where the belts come through. Cleaning the booster is next to impossible because it does not disassemble, you can't even remove the belts. To clean it, I have to remove the fabric seat back and then spray the entire chair down in the sink! Even then, I am unsure if I have cleaned all the trapped food out because I can not see the area I am attempting to reach. I have resorted to covering up the gaps in the seat with masking tape to prevent frequent ""deep"" cleanings.The concept of the booster is great for people looking for an alternative to a highchair and who have younger children, NOT SELF-FEEDERS."
1,Looks Good--until you actually have to use it,"I recently purchased this seat and was very disappointed when I opened the box and got it home. While it looked big and sturdy in the store and on the package(which I liked), it's very heavy and bulky, and VERY difficult to use. Unfortunately, the size and bulkiness of this seat makes it difficult to find a chair that this booster will fit on. The size and bulkiness also makes it very inconvenient to travel with. I found this booster seat to be extremely difficult to adjust the height or recline it. It actually took me and two grown men to get the seat reclined! It's definitely not easy to adjust unless there is WD40 involved! Also, the toys seem like a neat idea but are too difficult for an adult to operate let alone a child. I would recommend trying out the seat with your baby in the store if you can. Unfortunately, I made the mistake of not trying this seat out when I had the chance, if I had, maybe I would have saved myself the aggravation."
1,Don't buy this!!,"I bought this chair thinking it would be a great booster, but it is not!! These are the reasons:#1 Very difficult to recline#2 Baby's heels get stuck#3 Very, very, very hard to clean#4 Bar that goes between crotch moves & my baby loved pushing his feet on it making the tray about tip over- it eventually broke.I hate this booster!!!!!!"
4,Love it!,We LOVE this booster seat! It is comfy for our little guy and is easy to use and clean. Be careful of some somewhat sharp edges on the edges of the seat. Our little guy got two small cuts on his heel. We used an emery board to smooth them out and all is well. A must have for those who are on the go or do not have room for a high chair.
3,serves it perpose,"I really didn't have a lot of room to put a bulky highchair in my dining room so I bought this item. It doesn't really recline very well, so it was hard to feed my daughter at first. Now she does just fine with it, but I rarely use the tray. I think this product is better for older babies...6 months and up."
1,returned it!!,"i registered for this and once i opened it, it was junk. some plastic pieces were already broken and it really was very hard to move the seat. the toys are useless unless your little infant is hercules! i returned it"
5,"Excellent, Great and Perfect",The product was perfect and the service was excellent. We would order again from this site. Our granddaughter was very pleased.
4,1897 Sears Roebuck Catalog,"Invaluable for the research and interpretation of an 1895 farmhouse! I take it with me, for the edification of interested guests, as well as for my OWN education in what was available for the Victorian home...from buggy whips to clocks to glassware of the period."
4,It even smells like an old catalgue,If you like social history this is a fascinating book.Sears catalogue was similar to the Internet today; a collection of everything under the sun that could be bought.You get an insight into the products required by a household 100 years ago. If that interests you buy the book. Since it is a facsimile there is no explanation and analysis. Just a reproduction of the original catalogue.
5,A must-have for fans of vintage Americana...,"This book is a very good quality large paperback featuring crisp lettering and illustrations all the way through. I very much enjoyed the curiosities contained in the book, especially the archaic phrasing and overcooked descriptions of items. I found it amusing that the catalog states, in effect, don't be a nuisance and a waste of time by not doing your homework before purchasing products... the times have definitely changed! The range of goods sold and shipped by Sears, Roebuck, and Co., even at the end of the 19th century, is absolutely staggering! This Victorian-age wonder is ""coffee-table approved"" in my house."
4,A blast from the past.,"The quality if the reproduction is great, and the nostalgia of reading a catalog that my great-grandparents might have seen is cool.(I bought this book as a resource for Old West roleplaying games, and it suits that application very well.)"
5,Sears Roebuck & Co. 1897 Catalog,"Last to be sent of 3 books I purchased on that day, but still in a timely manner. Pleased with the book. Thanks."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I was extremely disappointed with this catalog and found my dealings with Best Media books negative at best. The advertisement for this book lends itself to a genuine Sears catalog, but in fact it's only a very poorly done reprint of the original. The printing is too light and the images are so blurred you would second guess your eyeglass prescription. It's no wonder so many sellers at Amazon are trying to dump this thing, it wouldn't have a chance at a bookstore where someone could view the quality first hand. My rating: ten thumbs down."
1,Misleading! Careful before you buy,"When the bottle arrived, reading the small print on the back, it turns out that each capsule only contain 100mg (NOT 500mg!) of the active ingredient (Phosphatidylserine). The other 400mg of the ""PhosphatidylSerine Matrix"" is Soybean Oil and other filler (Glycolipids and Phosphatidylcholine). I feel ripped off! It's not like these are cheap."
1,I wish I would've read the reviews before I bought this..,"Had I read the reviews,I would have seen that this product really IS a rip-off! 500 mgs-NOT!I thought I'd only have to take one a day,but there is only 100 mg of Phosphatidyl Serine in each pill,meaning you still need to take 3 a day.Source Naturals,I won't be buying any more of your products.After this,& my terrible experience with your Huperzine A,another supplement meant to improve memory,I have serious doubts about the quality of products made by yor company,& the honesty of the management.Source Naturals Phosphatidyl Serine Matrix 500mg, 60 Softgels"
2,Misleading Dosage,"Of course once you get it and take a look at it and see that there are only actually 20 mg of phosphatidyl, and then see the word ""matrix"" of course you could never sue and win. But, when you're shopping around and see that big 500 mg figure that is what sticks in your brain and is what you think you're going to get. No, the big number should be 20 mg per tablet - not 500."
2,Pills are hard to swallow,"The product claims to have 500 mg of Phosphatidylserine, but it only has 100 mg, the 400 mg left is just a blend of other components.The pills are very hard and difficult to swallow."
4,Pleased,I have been using this for 6 months and have noticed a difference in focus. I was getting it from a local store but this is more than half the price which I like. I was disappointed to find that its not a full 500mg but for the lower price I am happy.
3,phos serine works but not at this dosage,"I have taken phos serine for several months now and it improves my memory and mental clarity. I initially took this product because I liked the idea of the softgels, but it is true that the amount of phos serine in each gel is only 100mg, not 500mg. This amount is minimal at best and to its credit, I still felt it's effects which prompted me to explore further for products with higher dosages available. I recommend50 Grams (1.77 Oz) Phosphatidyl Serine Bulk Powder. It's pure phos serine powder and contains 5 times the amount for the same price. I take 300mg per day, and have been feeling tip top. I had noticed that I'm not as sharp as I was in my 30's and combined with stress I couldn't remember as well. I think when I run out of these I'm really going to be able to tell the difference, as it's usually in the absence of something that we truly appreciate it's presence."
2,PhosphatidylSerine MATRIX versus Pure PhosphatidylSerine,"As other reviewers have pointed out, in order to get 500mg of PhosphatidylSerine, you need to take 5 of these capsules as each one only actually only contains 100 mg of PhosphatidylSerine. The recommended dosage for PhosphatidylSerine is between 100 and 500 mg daily. 100mg being the absolute minimum and at least for me, does nothing for me. I've been taking 500-600 mg and sometimes even 700mg. At these dosages, the benefits start to take effect. Its a great supplement to increase brain functions. One just needs to take the correct amount as with anything, for it to actually work."

3,Did not get a chance to use this book,"I purchased this book to get to know Excel 2002 in depth, but my company upgraded to Office 2007 so I had to start all over again!! 8-("
2,Not rating VQR but Amazon's subscription scheme,"To be absolutely clear, I am a fan of VQR and if I were only rating them here, I'd give them 4 or 5 stars. My beef is with Amazon's advertising ""up to 75% off"" for subscriptions. I've checked the rates for VQR, Poetry, Writer's Digest, and Poets & writers, and I'm four for four: Amazon's rates are either exactly the same as those posted on these journals' websites, or (in the case of Writer's Digest and P&W) more expensive. It's nice, I guess, that Amazon is providing more exposure for these journals; nonetheless, for them to claim they're offering a discount, while not exactly a lie (since they're offering a discount over the per-copy price), is deceiving, as they don't seem to be offering a cheaper rate than that already offered by the journals. Caveat, as always, emptor."
2,A let down,"I had high hopes for this subscription. So far I have gotten 3 issues and have decided not to resubscribe. Each issue has a portion of a graphic novel inside. If I wanted that I'd buy a comic book. There are also academics writing short stories about academics. The other thing that bothers me is that it has a political slant, in this case left. I don't care left or right, what I do care is that I don't need propaganda.Stay away."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"If you value your dog this product is not for you. I followed the instructions on the package, my dog ended up in a fight and the buckle on the strap loosend and was off of her head in a matter of seconds. Two dogs were hurt and two people were bit thanks to this muzzle's failer."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!,"At the HarleyTalking.com discussion forum, we are always on the lookout for any great product ideas that we can pass along to our members. I have to say that this little gizmo is the best $3.95 I have ever invested into my beloved Harley. Anyone who rides as much as we do knows just how easy it is to leave a gas cap behind. It's also a bit of pain to decide where to put your cap while fueling. If you ride, you know exactly what I'm talking about. This gadget has solved both those problems forever. I just hang the cap from my clutch lever and it's right there when I'm done fueling. Can't leave without it! I bought 10 of these to give away to my riding friends, and will be buying more. It's literally a ""snap"" to install and you'll be happy you bought it every time you use it."
3,disappointing,"After spending weeks searching stores, online websites, EBay and Amazon, I was finally happy to find some cute bookends for my four-year-old daughter. I was disappointed when they arrived in less-than perfect condition, for a new product; especially given the cost.The paint job was sloppy; in several areas, colored paint was showing in areas it should not be. For some of them, I was able to use nail polish remover to remove the paint stains, though it did not work for all of them. Also, each bookend had a crack in the base, so only one side of each could be used, as the cracked side had to be turned to face the wall.One should not receive a ""new"" product in this condition. For this reason, I would not recommend it: very disappointing!"
2,no perfect tub,"They really almost had a perfect tub. Althought you have to fill your regular tub up with water, that would not have botherd me if the product would have worked. It would have been the perfect tub if they would have tested their product! When baby is put into the mesh tub the footrest unsnaps and folds upward, so I had to hold the footrest down while she bathed, which is very unfortunate because every other thing about the mesh tub was great, it was soft, she sat well in it etc. To bad!"
2,Only used it a few times.,It seemed like a great idea for giving my baby a sponge bath while waiting on the umbilical cord to heal. I also hoped to get use out of it for the 1st few months or so when he couldn't really play in the water too much. It was terrible. I just couldn't keep him warm. We had to make the baths very quick; I even tried laying a towel inside as a fabric that would be less cold. That was a mess and hassle. I ended up just holding him in the bathroom sink until he got bigger and I could hold in sitting position until I started using the tub I bought where he could soak in the water a little bit.
2,Did not like,I did not like this for a newborn. It might be better for an older baby. My little girl slid all over the place and turned sideways. We got the Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler tub and like it much better.
5,Best bath product I've used!,"With my first two children, bath time was a chore until they were toddlers. My one month old has used this since she came home and we love it. I never used it in the sink, however, so I'm not sure how well that would work. It was wonderful our first few days home, because I could sit in a sitz bath and keep her out of the water. Sponge baths were very easy. It cleans easily, dries easily and folds very flat for transport. We've gotten our money's worth from this product in one month!"
2,Unfortunately a bummer buy,"I am so disappointed that I have to return this. The others are correct, the bottom doe NOT stay down and there's no way your baby's weight will make it stay (it will make it flip even quicker). I LOVE the idea of a sling as opposed to a tub since it seems much more comfortable and gentle so I'm going to look for another before just exchanging it for a tub. I thought, ""Maybe they just had bad luck. They can't ALL be like that. It won't fold on me."" Wrong. (Bummer!) Put your efforts into picking a tub instead, or find a different sling. It's too bad they can't fix this since so many people seem to like the idea. I really am bummed out about this."
3,Get Your Rubber Duckie,"This is a great first place for a bath, only one problem. When baby is put into the mesh tub the footrest unsnaps and folds upward, so I had to hold the footrest down while he bathed. Kind of bummer."
2,Good but not great,I bought this product because it is compact and easy to store! I however have the same problem as do alot of other parents. The bottom keeps flipping up while I am bathing my son. I have to hold down the foot rest part while I am bathing him making it rather difficult. It is a great idea but they should have tested the product more before putting it on the market.
3,could be better,"the design is like a bouncy seat, which is good. the seat could use a safety harness because my daughter always slid down in the seat. my main complaint with this seat is that it really started to stink after a few uses. the mesh liner comes off and can go in the wash, but the white foam that is attached to the poles do not come off and those were the things that started to smell really bad."
2,Not so Great Tub,I bought this tub seat hoping to not have to hold on to my son while I tried to bathe him. The foot support comes up to high making it awkward for him to sit in the seat causing him to fall over. This is not good for small infants.
3,Good Product,"This product would have been great if the bottom part didn't keep snapping back up, I also had to keep holding it down while bathing my infant. They should have done more testing on this product. All the other tubs are too big for our infants up to the time they start sitting up. I love the product as a whole but found it anoying."
2,Safe mother,"I just got this item in the mail and opened it up to test it's functionality. For one it does not fit in my double sided sink. I was trying to avoid bending over at the bathtub.When I got the thing open and cliped on each side the upper bendable part kept flapping up, instead of securly staying in place. After testing the item I came to the conclusion that if I were to put my newborn in it, it would easily flip up while bathing her. The only good thing about it is that it folds up for easy storage and dries easily. Needless to say I returned it promptly for another bather."
2,Good concept but needs improvements,"Like the rest, the bottom of my bath seat folds up and it is really hard to bathe the baby while constantly fighting the seat. It is still better than those cold, hard plastic baby bath tubs, though. After reading the review that said they have improved the product, I am going to call the manufacturer and see what happens. Also, I don't think anyone else mentioned this, but you would have to have a very big sink to use it in one. A regular double kitchen sink is way too small."
1,Better Concept idea than reality allows for,"Bought it for the same reasons of:1. space saver (folds up)2. use in sink and tub3. holds baby with good supportLike it because:1. folds up2. dries quicklyHATE IT because1. BABY SLIPS down/off the older she gets (worse in the tub)2. Didn't fit in our standard size sink (the base did, but her neck still hit the edge of the sinkFor our next baby, I've already registered for the pillow-type support that hangs to dry. Picture of real mom with baby in the sink sold me...I'd rather have it soak up some water than have a useless item."
2,Fold up while in use..,"I loved the concept of this seat, and it fits well in my sink, also the amount of water was not an issue. The issue I had/have with it is the leg section keeps folding up while in use so it makes it awkward for my son to lay in it. I was imagining it would be like a bouncy seat and almost conform to my son. I found it to be very stiff."
4,Great Bather!,"I just purchased this bather and came here to see what others thought of it. They must have fixed the defect in the foot because I had no problems getting it to stay. It did take a little muscle to get it there, but once I did it was very secure."
1,Not so great,"This looked like a promising bath seat. It fit into my kitchen sink, it folded flat for storage or travel, and I liked that it was not hard plastic or foam. However, the foot end would not snap into place no matter what I did and it kept flipping up. I should have heeded those older reviews that said it did this. It was a constant hassle to keep one hand on the foot end to keep it down and keep the other on my baby...I needed another hand to wash her! Not only that, but the seat sits high and it takes a bit of water to fill the sink so the baby sits in some warm water and doesn't get too cold. I ended up getting the Safer Bather and was very happy with that."
1,"Compact design, but unsafe and unstable","I was excited about this tub design because it was basic and compact. It folds up nicely and is easy to rinse off. The mesh sling is removable for machine washing too.Unfortunately, the bath sling doesn't suction to the bottom of your tub or sink so it slides all over the place and is very difficult to control while holding onto your baby with one hand and bathing her with the other. My daughter is now four months old and I need to discontinue using this tub b/c she is much more active and I can't keep the tub in place.If it had a belt to help secure the baby and suction cups on the bottom, this product would be ideal. Unfortunately, this product was a big disappointment!"
2,good idea...bad design,"We like the idea that you can just fold this bather up and store it away or take it to Grandma's.However, no matter how hard we pressed down the seat prior, when we seated our newborn into it, the bather folded his little legs up toward the ceiling! We took what we thought was just a bad apple back to the store & got another one...no luck. Perhaps this bather works better for heavier babies, or maybe we just got TWO bad apples, but for now -- sure he's flexible -- but this was a ridiculous way to try to bathe!!"
4,Good music,I bought this CD based off of one of their songs I heard on the radio. After listening to it I like most of the other songs on it as well.
3,sounds like American country music,"I love her voice, but the style is a little too much like American country music for my taste. Not ""hard-core"" country music, though, more like crossover country that you hear on the radio, like Lady Antebellum."
4,lap quilting,I found this book to be very useful when it came to smaller projects. The patterns are easy to understand. I can't wait to make some of them.
4,Georgia Bonsteel makes it easy.,"I found this book to be well written and informative. The quilt patterns range from simple to complex for beginners and the more experienced quilter. For those of you who are beginners, invest in a rotary cutter system for this will make redundant cutting of pieces much faster and easier. I did find that I needed to purchase some extra yardage of fabrics due to my choice in color and arrangements, keep this in mind if you should chose to vary from the colors used in the book. I would have liked to see pointers on how to handle complex intersections in some of the star patterns that would have made them lay nicer. I had to learn by trial and error. (Practice with scraps on these until you feel you have it down.) All in all I found this volume to be well laid out with beautiful photography and helpful. The abundance of available pattern pieces was generous and should keep the reader busy attempting to recreate the wonderful quilts depicted in the book."
3,Just to let people know about this...,"This little gadget is cool, you can back up your data for the palm models it states and it is faster then the HotSync process which sometimes can take forever.One slight misgiving that is not mentioned however is the statement that says the data can be backed up without a computer. The palms can be backed up without a computer.But if you are looking for something to replace your data after you take your batteries out and everything is erased you will be dissappointed when it does not back up before you at least HotSync the MemorySafe program that comes with the backup device first.If you want to keep your palm going before you have a chance to get a computer, I found a battery backup that might work a bit better then this.This is still good for backing up information if you are paranoid about the batteries falling out and losing anything new since your last hotsytnc."
3,Far less brake does but slightly less grip,I've had these for almost a year now. They produce far less brake dust than the original Evo X pads and therefore have lasted longer. The grip level is good but not as good as the original pads because it requires more force to induce hard braking.
5,Los Anos con Laura Diaz,"The 5 stars I give this work is not because I am in love with Fuente's overall work, but because this historical fiction provokes thought and analysis in a poetic way of the life as seen through the eyes and feelings of a woman.If the reader wishes to to learn the history of a country while becoming enveloped in how a woman, a wife, a daughter, a lover and friend is impacted by the choices made, this is a book to read."
1,Fiasco monumental,"Este libro es un monunental fiasco y se queda en una aburrida y desabrida historia de una mujer que va dando tumbos por la novela sin orden ni concierto. Personajes desdibujados y guión deslabazado. Y la grán mentira de que salen Diego y Frida, que apenas ocupan diez de las 400 páginas que ocupa el tostón de libro este. Esperaba un libro que novelase la reciente historia de méxico y me he encontrado con un tostón que me ha costado terminar. Fuentes: me temo que no te daré otra oportunidad..."
2,Japioca Jundra?,"Very strange hits compilation that reads like it was compiled by someone whose absolute favorite album is ""The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees"". (How else to explain the bizarre inclusion of weak material like 'Poster' and 'P.O. Box 9847')?The bulk of the album is OK -- but you can get better hits compilations than this.Side Note: I give them credit for the cover -- which includes the Go-Go girls from the TV episode 'Some Like It Lukewarm'."
5,Vanished World Brought Back Into One Book,Superb presentation of different Royal and Imperial Courtsof Europe. Captures are some rare insight to less well knowncourts of Petty German States.
5,"Way of the Samurai, the life of Miyamoto Musashi","I felt that this was an amazing book! There was action that was in no way excessive as well as intrigue and philosophy. It is the first book in an amazingly well written series the chronicle the life of Miyamoto Musashi, the man who was the epitome of bushido. This book would be a great read for anyone who finds fuedal Japan even remotely interesting."
2,Somewhat helpful,"For the most part, there is nothing this book can teach you that you won't find in your casebook, but the problems are good practice. A lot of the information is helpful, but I don't know if you can trust all of the answers. My study group and I have found various confusing mistakes within and it has cost us valuable study time. See e.g. page 152 --second paragraph explaining a RAP problem (the author confuses O and A in saying that all of A's children would be born or conceived upon O's death)."
4,A Reader is Right...,"The book is good, but there ARE mistakes - and not all of them are even typos. So get it and read it, but be careful. Overall, it's definitely worth it and will help you to understand future interests."
2,"bad acting, disappointed","I have been waiting literally years for this movie to come out on DVD. I have been contacting people, reading blogs, and constantly checking for its release. Finally I was able to get the movie off the self medicated website. I was so excited to put the movie in only to be completely disappointed and wishing I could get my money back. The biggest let down was the acting. Except for the homeless man, the characters are all boring. Apparantly the man who wrote and directed the movie also chose to be the main star. Unfortunately I can only describe him as a bad actor. In fact I knew he was a bad actor right from the beginning. His interactions with his mother seem rehearsed and scripted instead of making it appear like a natural interaction. The story lacked development and the movie never really grabbed my attention. Overall it was a waste of 106 minutes. I feel like giving it one star but since I stayed awake for the entire movie, I felt obligated to give it two."
1,Too much sugar,"I was excited to find a yogurt product for my cats since they love dairy products so much. And one of my cats really really liked the drops, but after I read the ingredients and discovered the first ingredient is sugar, I stopped giving them to the cats. Sugar is not something I think cats should have, especially since they don't brush their teeth!"
5,Taste-tempting treat,"My cat is a very finicky eater, but she just loves these yogurt drops. Actually, they smell so delicious that I'm almost tempted to sample them myself!"
4,My Lucy Review,"This collection was great! I really thought I was going to end up with a terrible collection. However, the picture and sound quality was awesome! The reason I thought this was going to be a terrible collection is because I have purchased other collections from this company and the picture and sound was distorted. Anyway, if you love Lucy, and we all do, then this collection is definitely for you."
4,Good Lucy,"My only complaint is that there are only a couple episodes with Vivian Vance in them. I love Lucy and Vivian together, so that was a little disappointing."
4,"If you can't afford Complete Seasons of Lucy, get this...","My wife and I are huge fans of Lucy, but the ""I Love Lucy"" DVD sets were too expensive and the show is frequently shown on TVLand anyway. So, to see more of Lucy, at a reasonable price, I bought this DVD set of ""The Lucy Show."" You get 30 episodes of hilarity, with Gale Gordan playing Mr. Mooney, Lucy's boss, and her old pal Vivian Vance returning as Lucy's friend. Many 60's T.V. and Movie stars make appearances. The episodes on DVD haven't been enhanced, but they are quite watchable."
2,Let down!,"Waited to watch the Lucy Show eagerly. However, the quality of the episodes, sound and picture both, was a BIG let down. Come on, I have seen videos older than The Lucy Show in better, fat better condition.One wonders why The Lucy Show had such poor picture quality. Wanted to buy more but not anymore.Regretfully,BR"
2,barely broke a sweat!,"This video did very little for me. Not only was the warm-up too short, the actual dance with each combo gets old real fast. By the third time I did the video I knew the dance and just wanted them to get on with it and stop explaining. Good for low impact or for people with a lack of coordination. If yer looking for a good cardio this video comes up short. And let me tell you, you wont be catching me do any of these moves at a club!"
3,grind workout strength & fitness,"VHS tape was damaged in 1 spot for about 30 seconds. The rest of the tape was fine. Delivery was very fast. Content- my least favorite of the Grind series, but still an excellent workout."
3,Its SOLAR,"This solar shower is reasonably well made, but...if the weather is less than summer weather, I definitely recommend pre-warming the water. With daytime temperatures in the mid-60s, with clouds and a moderate wind, it never got the icy cold water above still pretty cold. It was a tough test for a passive solar shower, and I don't think any of them would work adequately. Still, it made for a great source of water for washing up, and if I had been devoted enough to the shower idea, prewarming the water would have achieved what the rather weak sun couldn't. In summertime (of course when cold showers aren't as horrific) it heats up and gets fairly hot."
3,PowerMadd Riser,I was told by powermadd that this would work with a factory set up. Meaning no extensions needed. Well they were wrong. The factory lines only extended about 2 inches. Quality of product was good. Milled aluminum.
5,Beautiful,"Wow! This crystal pendant is so pretty! Wear it on an 18 inch or 30 inch chain and like it both ways. Had purchased a clear heart shaped crystal pendant and gave it to my hairdresser. She loves it, but I love this pink pendant best."
3,"Poor sync, but awesome concert","First of all, let me say that this concert was extraordinary--there's no denying that. HOWEVER, the video and audio are NOT IN SYNC. The music lags behind at least half a second, which is more than enough to be distracting, especially when Martin hits a drum or a cymbal. It is especially distracting when you see Hiromi moving to the music (especially the fast solid beats). It takes a lot of the enjoyment out watching it. I just wish the engineers would have done a better job when putting all the media together."
5,Really really good music,"Victor Mecyssne makes some really really good american music - covers all kinds of genre's - at times jazz, at times blues, at times folk, at times almost lounge, at times rockabilly. Great voice, great wellwritten songs... Just really good music - too bad he's relatively unheard of :("
4,My Favorite Victor CD Yet,I really liked this CD. The variety on it is amazing. It's a must have for any serious blues fan.
3,Great cologne ..... if you buy it at a brick and mortar store !!!!!,"I was running out of this cologne so I decided to buy one on Amazon despite some of the reviews. Well, i can tell you first hand something is wrong with these colognes. My original cologne which i bought at sephora smelled great and lasted the whole day. This one smells great but it last for 2 - 3 hours top; after that you cannot even tell you ever put it on.Again, this cologne is great if you buy it at a regular store. I will not be buying colognes at Amazon anymore."
5,Burberry's Cologne,"My husband has used this cologne for many years, and I love the subtle scent. I have ordered it through Amazon before. The prices on Amazon are extremely competitive, and almost always cheaper than other online fragrance sites."
5,Pleasant and Appealing,Very nice male fragrance. Burberry is not heavy or overwhelming but rather a subtle woodsy scent that is gentle on the nose. Great product for the price.
5,Great Buy! Best price online,"This product size is bigger than it looks, the best price to be found, and smells sooooo great."
4,Smells GREAT!,"I bought this cologne based on the previous reviews. I must say...the reviews were spot on! It's a great scent that lingers, but does not over power. I would suggest every man have this in their stockpile."
1,Very disappointed in this item,"This item was a Christmas gift and if I did not have to leave in two days, I would return it.It is the Burberry Men's Eau de Toilette Cologne and it came in a cardboard box with the word Tester on it and a plastic band on the top which should have been a cap, but had a hole in it. It did not look like the picture on Amazon's web site at all. This is a major disappointment and Amazon should not deal with these people any more. I doubt very much if this is a true Burberry product at all."
2,Looks like fake Burberry,First of all I got this and cologne leaks from the spray cap and the smell is lil different than I had before and won't stay on body for not even an hour . Also on the bottle I see a sticker which is removed (could be a tester one) where as I ordered a new one for $35.I think I got crap for the money.
3,It's okay!,I liked it but observed that there is some dust inside the bottle. Not able to judge if it is original.I am not satisfied with this item.But I dont want to get into returning this and waiting for other item.
5,CLASSY & CLASSIC,"My wife gave me a Burberry's gift set and it's now become my favorite scent.She didn't buy it on Amazon and paid nearly twice as much as it's advertised for here. I know where I'll be buying my Burberry's from now on.Everyone has different body chemistry so no cologne smells the same on everyone. However, I have received more compliments on this scent than on any I've ever worn."
4,Super,One of the best perfumes i have purchased... its mild but lasts a long time..I strongly recommend it...
5,Burberry for Men,"Even tho this cologne has been out for about 10 years, I really like it and have had others comment on how good I smell :-)Was very pleased with Amazon's price and the quick delivery time."
2,Smell like Spiced candied Apple,"I read the reviews and almost everyone was favorable, so I took a chance and bought this without smelling it. Big mistake. BTW, I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good so I was looking forward to the Burberry original and I really wanted to like it. It smells like a house at Christmas time. Think cinnamon, pumpkin pie, spiced apple.If you want to smell like that, give it a try. It is a cheap, synthetic, imitation to traditional bay rum."
5,Love it,I have been buying this cologne in the Burberry outlet for a few years at a much higher cost. It lasts a long time on the ody but be sure not to spray too much. It can be overwhelming at first
5,ORGASM 4 the NOSE,"sorta spicy/smokey/oriental/amber/warm. definitely not a fruity or floral or powder scent- so it's definitely masculine. lots of compliments from people i allow close enough to catch the scent of it- i wear it mostly to please my own senses.i think it would be a great gift choice for young men or older men- who don't yet have a favorite cologne or the 1st cologne gift for a young man in high school- it's the kind of scent where if you or others don't love it_ they usually like it. I also enjoy the original perry ellis for men and paul sebastian. the paul sebastian has a powdery scent but it's blended with masculine scents. so if you are familiar with 1 of these and like it, there's a good chance you'll at least like the other two scents.this is for 'burberry by burberry for men'_ burberry makes many colognes with burberry in the name so be careful when choosing."
4,Pleasant smell,"This cologne has a pleasant smell of apple, I could imagine this going well with an outdoor occasion like perhaps going to a park, beach..etc. In my opinion it may go better with a classy look and it does seem to be a bit strong, but it definitely is a great scent."
4,Woody's,"Nice classic fragrance. Think modern, British, stability. I have like all the Burberry line. This orginal and the London line are my favorites."
5,Hard to Find,"I cannot believe I found this large bottle at such a small price! I've been searching drugstores, department stores and everywhere else for this deal on Burberry Original and I'm so happy I found it here! My boyfriend fell in love with the cologne years ago, and giving him another bottle is the gift that keeps on giving!"
2,Blechhh...,"This stuff smells like insecticide, like RAID or something. Was not what I was expecting at all. I think I was mistaken for a different cologne. So I let my Dad have it. Apparently he likes it."
2,Don't Care,Super Bubble Pop is a bubble based action puzzler game where the idea is to quickly and efficiently clear the grid of bubbles to advance to the next stage while gaining as many points as possible. A crazy collection of DJs are waiting inside for their chance to become the ultimate popper; but now is the time to throw up.
5,Glad I got it!,"I'm very happy with whole deal. It was just as it was stated, and I got it in a timely matter."

1,a CULT started in order to make money,"This book was written by a race-car driver who wanted to start a cult to make money. Everything that he says is supposed to make sence scientificaly even though it doesn't. He gives translations on the bible that don't appear anywhere else. If you are buying this book in order to find religious meaning or something like that talk to a Priest, Rabbi or whoever,but don't waste your money on this book. The only reason that I would say that this is not a total waste of money is if you are into sci-fi books and are going to put this book along with your star-treck and star-wars."
1,100% Nonsense,"The title of the book should be: How to start a cult and make money! It is hard to believe that there are people that belong to this cult... I gave one star because there is no ""zero star"" option."

1,"The Elohim,Selfish beings!...","I agree with Raelian that we've been brought to life by the Elohim who created us in the first place to mine the Gold from earth and they are the one who left us to death when the flood happen long time ago. They created us for their own convenience and I think they should be ashamed of themselves for what they did. Raelians are promoting clowning these days, so one day they might create another stupid race who are going to be our slaves to serve us in our new heaven earth :) Guys read the Biggest secret (by David Icke) to find out the source of our problems (Bani Ha Elohim)or sons of the Elohim the awfuly rich Bloodline who's controling the world today while we are the slaves who serve their own heaven. the game is repeating itself but is getting ridiculous."

5,The best knitting book I've ever seen,"I have this book and it is fabulous, and I would like to get a copy for a friend. It is the most complete and most objective book I've ever seen. She presents not just her preferred way for doing each technique, but many ways (maybe all) with their pros and cons and you can choose. Everything is so clearly explained and illustrated that I can always do it myself with little difficulty. PLEASE REPRINT!!!!"
5,Please Reprint This Book!!,"I looked through this book at a knitting retreat and would dearly love to learn from it. Who can do anything about getting this book back into print? how can it be done? What is Simon & Schuster waiting for? What a treasure! Amazon, please petition them for a reprint!"
5,IT'S COMING BACK!!!,"According to Alishia Nix, Customer Service, at Simon & Schuster:Principles of Knitting will be reprinted in the fall of 2009.ISBN# 1416535179$45.00 retailYAYYYYY!!!!!!!!"
5,simon & schuster: REPRINT REPRINT REPRINT PLEEEEZE!!!!!!!!!,"this is by so far the best book on knitting. it demystifies & illuminates, how do we get the publishers to reprint? hey, & thank you June Hemmons Hiatt for everything"
2,save your money,"does not worth the price. Period. it's about $20 soft cover $40 hard cover book if that. Lot's of personal opinion shared. Has a common opinion that is a knitting encyclopedia of some sort which drives the price. Unjustified in my opinion. If you are working on lace and want to knit it fast, if your heritage from Russia, they do it the way you always have being doing it. This book is not going to add anything for you. The author is kida narrow minded in my humble opinion."
2,"Huh? what is this about, again?","I was led to believe that this is a great ground breaking book in comic novel, but came away with a bad taste in mouth. I think the artist lacked the sense of meaningful unity in his story. Then again, I am much older, more comfortable with the underground comix from the late 60's-70's. The artwork in this book gives that nostalgic feel for the black and white comix, but wow...very derivative of pointless highschool ""drama"" genre...where there is no drama, but life goes on drearily."
3,Not what I expected...,"A lot of reviewers have gushed over this GN, but I just didn't see what all the fuss was about. I will say that the art is great, actually very disturbing at times. I did not grow up in the seventies, but the experiences of these teenagers were very familiar and it is obvious that Mr. Burns' teenage years are very fresh in his mind. With all that said, the story really doesn't go anywhere and there is never a satisfying, ""wow"" type moment. Maybe it was supposed to just be a nihilistic journey through a surreal group of high school kids who want to get high and laid. It acheived that for sure, but the effect was quickly forgotten after closing the book."
5,Mind-twisting Fun,"This is one of the strangest, yet, brilliant things you'll ever see. It's, by turns, sexy, violent, decadent, and nightmarish. The detail, to even the most, seemingly, insignificant things is incredible. While the action takes place in the 70's, the message is timeless. You'll never look at casual sex, STD's, drugs, alienation, and the homeless, the same way, ever again."
4,"Nothing bad so say, it just wasn't amazing.","This was an excellent, well-drawn novel with a great story. I would recommend it to anyone. It just wasn't five-stars good. I picked it up at the book swap here at work, and I'm glad I did. I enjoyed the read, but I would have been slightly disappointed if I had bought it.This book was a very easy read. The drawings are, for the most part, pretty simple, and the dialouge flows well. I finished it in about 2 hours. For most of the first chapter, I contemplated stopping and returning the book, but it does slowly draw you in.Like I said, it's a good read, and worth the time, but I'm not sure it's worth the money. I doubt I would ever re-read it."
3,"Brooding, but Enjoyable","A twisted, creepy, disturbing, yet enticing graphic novel about a foreign ""bug"" infecting a city and ruining the lives of the people who receive it. (I interpreted it as a metaphor for AIDS, but every other review seemed to associate it with teenage loneliness, which makes sense as well...) The two main characters are both extremely brooding and angsty (go figure--they're high schoolers), and it's got confusion, murder, sex, and drug-trip-inspired creepiness.If you're into film noir and dark stories, you will probably love it. If you can't do macabre, steer clear. And if you can't take angst with no true rationale behind it, this story will probably seem over-the-top. But I enjoyed the ride."
2,Half-baked,"I'm surprised this book got such a favorable reception. I found it half-baked in every regard. The characters aren't very compelling. The central conceit of the book - that there is a contagious disease of some sort that produces bizzare deformities seemingly unique to each individual -- a tail, a talking mouth in a neck-- is rather puerile. Everyone seems to take this state of affairs in stride, for reasons that go unexplained, and they're more worried about getting laid even if it means contracting the disease. But nothing much happens - the story crawls along and then peters out. The black and white artwork is rather dull. I can't think of anything to recommend this book, actually."
3,The weakest graphic novel I've seen in years . . .,"In general, I like graphic novels (as opposed to a republished comic book series) when they're done right. The combination of well-written story and well-drawn art can be vastly entertaining on multiple levels. This one is huge -- it's unpaged but it's got to be 350-400 pages -- but it makes little or no sense. About one-third of the way through, I began skimming, hoping to catch on to the storyline, but it never happened. The plot, which apparently has to do with a bunch of high school students, who engage in all the often risky behavior teenagers engage in, contracting some sort of strange disease (or something) that leads to peculiar facial growths, skin-shedding, appearance of tiny mouths on the throat, and other weirdness. Moreover, the drawing style is a heavy black-and-white that (usually) doesn't allow sufficient detail."
3,I keep wanting more.,"I read this, and I read this quickly. I enjoyed the story and the artwork. I would pass it around and tell my friends to read it, buy it, check it out of the library. However, there is a lot of ambiguity in the story. I as a reader was interested but I keep wanting more. Not more in the sense of I like the universe of the story which is in itself a well-contained narrative.What Black Hole lacks is a well contained narrative itself. This device might be a conscious effect of the writer. The reader is left with many questions unanswered about the plot in general, the motive force behind the plot, and the ultimate fate of the characters. I want you to read this book so I can ask you what you think the bug is.I think it's a metaphor for teenage alienation, but I'm not sure. I just don't want to get it."
5,Wonderfully Funny and Subversive,"Combining the best elements of sci-fi, horror, and those cheesy movies designed to scare teens in the '70s, Black Hole is wonderfully funny and subversive while also being genuinely thrilling and disturbing. In 1970s Seattle, a group of teens battles against sexual desires that threaten to leave them monstrously deformed. A new sexually transmitted disease has come alive, and there's no cure. The strange effects of the disease--different for everyone who catches it--mirror the pain and isolation of high school. Black Hole is tragicomic in the best sense of the word: It takes itself seriously, and so do its readers. How could you not? When one chance encounter with the wrong person could lead to a lifetime of horror, you can't help but be just a little bit nervous.-- John Hogan"
5,Good,"Graphic novel, set in the '70s, with a group of teenagers and the very strange mutating-STD that develops. Primarily a character-driven piece, using the weird disease as both metaphor and the driving plot to character transformation. Also has a somewhat unnecessary horror mystery arc put within the larger narrative. The artwork is beautiful, very distinctively and evocatively drawn. I first saw this book in the gift shop for an art museum, and I can see why. The story is also reasonably effective, if not quite as breathtaking. The use of genre elements is poor (the bug pretty much has to be magical, no explanation for the origin is given and people seem remarkably unconcerned about a disease that causes a second mouth to grow on someone's neck). Still, it's effective for some very creepy moments and some solid character progression."
4,Not What I was Expecting,"This a fine book for researchers into their family history. However, I was looking for a different ""The Crawford Family"" by Paul Ostendorf.I particularly enjoyed the section on American Revolutionary Soldiers. Looks like I could be DAR material!"
4,Nice compilation,"All the tracks you could possibly hope for in a 'best of' compilation, are here. I had serious doubts about the quality of the remastering carried out by Rhino in 2002. Apparently there are more recent upgrade releases but none with the same faultless track listing as this one. This collection is great for someone who has heard all the hits and is looking to dig a little deeper into the Chicago back catalogue."
5,Excellence!!!!!,"I purchased the album using the club membership. I saved money,and it came quickly.Back To The Blanket: A Native Narrative Of Discovery"
5,Pretty Complete Chicago,"Everything's there execpt ""While The City Sleeps"", ""A Hit By Vare'se"" and a few others. What IS there is some pretty great stuff. Chicago Fans rejoice! Thanks"
2,Arrggghhh! Not *again*!,"C'mon, do we really need *another* Chicago ""Best Of,"" ""Greatest Hits,"" or other redundant compilation? By my count there are now at least 7 of them. The two ""Heart of Chicago"" comp discs came out only a few albums back. Anyway, Chicago is one of my all-time favorite groups, but isn't it time they put out an album of new material, as opposed to *another* CD of their greatest hits arranged in a different order? They're still such great musicians that they shouldn't have to rely on gimmicks and touring the oldies-circuit, but for some reason they've chosen that path. They deserve better, and so do their fans."
2,I miss the old Chicago,"My friend told me that Chicago didn't really do anything good after Chicago II except the song Saturday In the Park, and I agree with him. Back before they became soft-rock icons, Chicago was tough blues-rock band, as displayed on their debut album, which featured rockers such as Introduction, Poem 58, South California Purples, Someday and I'm a Man. Chicago II lost the rock edge a bit, but still gave us rockers with 25 or 6 to 4 and the It Had Better End Soon suite. After that, they just died. Just like that. Became dull soft-rockers, churning out sleep-inducing, elevator music-ish ballads such as You're the Inspiration, If You Leave Me Now, Along Comes a Woman, Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?, Stay the Night, What Kind of Man Would I Be and countless others. Protest this drivel! Buy Chicago's first album, back when they had some spirit and weren't just in it for the money. Flame me if you will, but Chicago has been dead for decades now."
1,ONE MORE BEST OF,"A CHICAGO FAN FOR MANY YEARS. ANOTHER 'BEST OF' CHICAGO. SOONTHERE WILL BE MORE BEST OF ALBUMS THAN ORIGINAL RECORDINGS. IFYOU HAVE THE BOX SET (COLUMBIA YEARS) AND 1982-1989, THAT IS ALLYOU NEED. ONE (1) SONG FROM CHICAGO 13 THAT I LIKE THAT DID NOTMAKE ANY OF THE 'GREATEST HITS' CD'S WAS RERUN. PROBABLY THELAST GOOD SONG FROM LAMM. I GAVE IT A ONE (1) STAR BECAUSE IHAD TO RATE THIS CD....."
5,great collection in one package...,"If you're as old as dirt, like I am, you probably have all the Chicago albums you ever want or need on vinyl. That's why this is such a must have for the jewel case or digital collection. The sound is great, virtually all their hits are here. What else could you want? (OK, still having Terry Kath would be nice...)"
4,The essence of rock's class act,"Chicago first came on the scene with a great new sound, the combination of rock with the energy of the big bands, thanks to the fabulous horn section. The first disc here salutes that great sound, that great era.In time, the group faded and then came back with a MOR sound. This disappointed many fans, but kept them going for a long while. The second disc highlights this second part of Chicago's career. However, the set closes with a rip-roaring rendition of the big band classic, ""Sing, Sing, Sing"".This collection isn't so much for the Chicago fan as it is for collectors of the era's music who need a good over-all representation of Chicago and the group's influence on the music scene."
5,Chicago... At its best,"My wife had seen this set on TV and so we decided to pick it up here at Amazon. No matter what era of Chicago you love, its all here. From 25 or 6 to 4 to You're the Inspiration... you'll find yourself singing along through this one. This extremely talented group has spread their hits out across several decades, the true sign of musicians who work at their craft.You'll find yourself playing through these discs many times. And that makes the purchase completely worthwhile."
5,5 for content and 5 for quality of remaster,"Congrats to Rhino once again for the above reasons. I have owned Chicago 1 thru 5 on vinyl and I am not at all disappointed the single releases are on here, afterall this is a brief look at this bands huge output. You have likey heard all these tracks but if you have not and you fall in love with this band by all means buy their full length remastered cd's and enjoy a spectacular sonic voyage.Awesome tunes, you will constantly find yourself humming all day long.Is it the killer melodies or the kicka$$ brass?"
3,1/2 Good,"I really enjoyed the first CD of this two CD set as it contained songs from the early years. However, the second CD contained newer songs with new band members from a time period I stopped enjoying Chicago's music. I would have much preferred two CDs filled with tunes from the early years. They certainly had enough songs in their repetoire to do so."
1,"Great Songs, Poor Sound","Given all of the excellent reviews, I expected a superior album. The song selection is fantastic, but the lyrics are unintelligible - muddied, low volume. Great idea, poor execution. Very disappointing."
4,Excellent Hint Of Things To Come - Hopefully!,"This 2-CD compilation, the beginning of a Rhino Records Chicago reissue program, does a good job of compiling highlights of the many years of Chicago. For a hardcore fan like myself, the new edits are great to hear and since I own and will be repurchasing all of the individual albums, they end up being different than the album versions that I'll eventually have. As with all compilations, you can squabble about individual tracks that should have been included and weren't or tracks that were included and shouldn't have been, but this is a very representative set. The most promising thing is the greatly improved sound quality of these recordings. If the coming reissues sound as good as the tracks on this set, I'm sure that everyone will be pleased. For now though, this is a very reasonably priced and very well put together collection. Yes, some of the later material is a bit lacking, but overall it's a NICE JOB!"
2,Disappointment,"I picked this CD up an rushed home to listen with great expectation of reliving many hours of listening to great Chicago songs. This compilation was a great dissapointment. The depth of Chicago's sound has always impressed me the layers of voices and horns. I listened to the first four tracks on my upstairs system and it sounded a little flat like AM radio. This system is under powered and I thought that the dynamics might be a problem. I then moved to my primary system, far from under powered, and listened. No improvement and noticable distortion in the the horns. While I won't take it back, I will wait for the soon to be issued remasters to purchase any more Chicago. Hope they put out a good version of Carnegie Hall. (I still have that on vinyl somewhere.) This set will be religated to other than critical listening. Maybe the car."
5,"Chicago, The VeryBest of>Only The Beginning","This CD was a surprise with all the great songs on two CDs for the price. The songs the way you want to hear them. Not rearranged,but the way they were released. Well worth the money, you will love it."
5,Excellent!! An Intro to Soft Rock!,"First of all let me say I was introduced to Chicago by way of Peter Cetera. I really enjoyed every one of P.C. albums and a friend of mine told me that he had been a part of Chicago before he went solo, so this was the very first Chicago CD that I purchased.I was fairly familiar with most of the songs (Your the Inspiration, Baby What a big Surprise, Hard to Say I'm Sorry, Saturday in the Park) having heard them on the classic rock radio station in my town. It also includes a few of their lesser known songs (at least for me). I have since purchased all 32 albums and have thoroughly enjoyed each one.If you are not very familiar with Chicago or just want most of their best songs, this would be a wonderful introduction to a great soft rock band.However, as other reviewers have said if have most of their albums this is not the album for you.I will say this though even though I have all 32 albums, I still listen to this album the most."
4,"The greatest hits, and then some.","I recently picked up ""The Very Best Of"" after deciding their 80's ""Greatest Hits"" was just way too little. This 2-disc collection includes everything the ""Hits"" album had, and a ton more, obviously their earlier material. I was extremely happy to get my hands on ""25 Or 6 To 4"", ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"", ""Just You 'N' Me"", and ""Feelin' Stronger Every Day"". It's also wonderful to now own ""Baby What A Big Surprise"" and ""If You Leave Me Now"", which is possibly my favorite of theirs. There's no doubt that I enjoy the Cetera-sung tracks the most, and in truth I could have narrowed this down to 20 tracks. However, even though I believe the better stuff begins with ""Saturday In The Park"", it's all good. Hey, I'm a child of the 80's, what can I say. These songs remind me alot of visiting family in Illinois, and they still ""Make Me Smile"" today."
5,Chicago is alive and well on this CD,"Great compilation of 39 of Chicago's Greatest Hits in a two CD set. I play it over and over. The CD's have no imperfections and the music played without 1 skip or problem. Great Band, Great CD Collection and the price was right too, less than $15.00 how can you go wrong if you like a band's work."
4,Good Chicago Collection,"I enjoyed more of the songs on Disk 2. Disk 1 was more the side of Chicago I was unaccustomed to. Still, if you want all of Chicago's best in one place, this one is it"
4,FAB 5 Live Prty Mix,"I have two or three copies of this CD. If you want hours of good music. Do yourself a favor, or a friend and get your hands on both of these CD'S Whether you like Reggae music or not you will love Fab 5! DON'T MISSED THIS! The most Entertaining group you have ever heard!"
5,No Eye Can See,It has been years since I have found a book this enjoyable to read.I am so glad this book is one in a series. There is a lot wisdom in the characters dialog. I am a new fan of Jane Kirkpatrick's. -
5,Loved the series!,"Our book club read this series! What great conversations we had. The writing was so visual, you could picture what the characters looked like, how life would be on the trail. I appreciate Jane's writing because it has depth to it. I appreciate how she takes a little piece of a person, researches, and takes liberty to share about them. So the fiction has some truth about it and we learn something! Our book club will continue to have Jane's books in our cycles of reads!"
4,Historical fiction,Good continuation of the kinship and courage saga. It tied up all the story lines. Good character development in all of her books.
3,Difficult to immerse into,"I found this book at the library and was excited because Jane Kirkpatrick was a new Christian author for me. However, the book was a letdown. I found it difficult to keep track of all the characters. I was very confused about Zilah and her crazed demise at the beginning. I've picked up a middle book of a series before and didn't have a problem reading it. However, I have no interest in reading the other books in the series. Just not as good to me as a Liz Curtiz Higgs or Francine Rivers."
3,Keep with it - it does get better.,"This book strides away from the normal Troughton-esqe monster story and goes for a political type story instead. I found the book quite bland for at least the first half of the book, but you should stick with it as the pace and excitement greatly increases after the first half with the arrival of the VETACS (robot super warriors). Just approach this book as a no-brainer and you should find, at least, a little bit of enjoyment out of it."
2,"""Dreams"" too much in the Ninties","When I first read ""Dreams of Empire"" I noticed two things.First, it was not much like a second Doctor story from the sixties. He would never usually handle things like he did here, the violence and technology is nothing like what the writers of the show at the time wanted, and the overall second Doctor playfullness got turned into silliness.Second, this story is too much a cross of the Roman Empire and ""Star Wars."" Down to the last detail of the man in the mask, it was Darth Vader.Overall, the book has an enjoyable plot, but it needed more creative characters and an eighth Doctor setting."
5,Great little book about the real inventor of the airplane,"I have just read the book, and it's great. It's really well written, and even if it doesn't go too deep (and I believe that was never Mrs. Winters' goal with this project), it goes deep enough to raise a few eyebrows, and make us wonder: how come the real inventor of the airplane can be almost forgotten nowadays?After all, his vehicle, the 14-bis, unlike the Wright Brothers Flyer, could fly by its own means..."
4,The past is decided in the future,"I read this book , here in Brazil.This book is good.It is a correct biography.The main failure of this book is that it forget the theories about flying of Santos Dumont.Even so, this book is a good biography.The main lesson of this book is this:the past is decided in the future.Even making everything excellent, the future became against Santos Dumont.The past was decided the future.Wright Brothers even being without no doubt racists, eugenicists and perhaps even buffoons and liars, got the recognization, from the world, while Santos Dumont went to nothing in aviation's history."
2,NOT good for running...,"...the stiff metal band in the middle, coupled with the hard plastic edge of the covering and the inability to set a fixed tension point (the design ends up tightening the fit more and more as you run), render these bands extremely uncomfortable if worn around the ankles on bare skin, and not much better around the upper arm or (least uncomfortable) the wrist. I guess if you were wearing it over pants or a long-sleeved jacket it would be less of a problem.I bought this product hoping to use it with my Garmin footpod, but alas the band is actually too wide to fit the footpod's slide-through belt loop casing, so I had to take a pair of utility scissors and trim a part of the band.Now I will have to try and find an ankle band made of neoprene or some other softer material with a velcro closure or some other means of adjusting the tightness of the fit. Oh well, the pitfalls of internet shopping---not being able to try something on first before ordering."
2,Not for running...,"I bought these bands to wear when running at night in the winter. However, the velcro is not lined on the back and has sharp corners. I didn't even try them because I knew that they would snag my running tights all up. I returned them and will be buying more bands from Amphipod instead. These would work great when worn over pants while biking but can't be worn over delicate fabrics."
1,not very reflective,This product is only reflective to 400 feet. Poor comparative value. Lot of better products available.
3,great reflectivity,"nice and reflective and i like the high vis orange on the edges.... great around my wrists, but need about 2 more inches to get around my ankle (and i don't think my ankles are really large!!)... i can get about 1/4"" of velcro to close. probably great for kids and people w/ thin legs.great product, but just too small for me. saw some complaints about velcro biting into bare ankles... i could see that being an issue, but i wear socks... no problem."
2,Scratchy velcro,"These ankle bands are highly reflective, so I was looking forward to trying them. Unfortunately, if you wear shorts, the velcro scratches against your bare skin. I tried all sorts of variations: loosening/tightening the bands; turning the velcro towards the front, sides and back of my ankles; and wrapping the bands clock-wise and counter-clockwise around my ankles. Nothing worked.Nathan could re-design these by using velcro that is narrower than the width of the band. That would be easy to do. With the current design, these are probably better suited to wearing over pants or long socks. Bicycle commuters with long pants would probably love them. However, I will be returning these."
4,No more pain,I was first introduced to The Stick by my physical therapist. I developed a serious injury from ignoring tight and sore muscles. I use the stick before and after my runs and It has been amazing. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is an active runner.PROS: Works as advertised.CONS: If you apply too much pressure to The Stick it could develop a bow over time.
4,"It works, but you have to be fairly flexible to use it effectively","I bought this because I ripped a hamstring and the therapist used one in the clinic. It works, but it works better if you have a willing partner to apply it. Initial application can can be a little painful, but it is worth it."
4,Magic Stick,"Upon my graduation from Hogwarts, my parents purchased one of these Magic Sticks for me as a gift. I was looking forward to changing it up from my garden variety magic stick, which is hardly discernible from a ""garden variety"" stick any fellow may stumble upon in the forest. This one, being a bit more flashy, was just what I was looking for. It took me some getting used to, but the learning curve isn't anything that should put anyone off. The only CON I have with it, is that sometimes it lags when attempting to cast certain spells, such as lightning bolt, fire bolt -- pretty much any of the common 'bolts'. Anyway, I've learned to compensate for its anti-bolt design just fine."
1,not well written,The author has clearly been touched by her relationships in a nursing home and is probably very good in her job. she is NOT a professional author. I was not able to finish the book.
3,why I bought it,"I feel this books is not about quantitative finance, but about pricing arithmetics. There is a massive body of quantitative finance theory out there that is probably too dry (for most readers without PhD), too complicated (for paper-and-pencil every day use), too tricky to get right, requires too many input numbers. In contrast, some of the market practitioners probably rely on another (smaller) body of knowledge for everyday pricing. Much simpler, manageable, and much more practical.I feel this books has more coverage on interest rate products and forex.Not confident enough to give a star rating, so the neutral 3-star"
4,Un Excelente Libro Para Entender Las Matematicas Financieras!,Es dificil encontrar un libro que te explique con tanta claridad (sencillo) el tema de las matematicas financieras. Vale la pena tenerlo.
5,A must-read for any creative artist!,"This book was--the back cover says--Campbell's last. I can imagine Campbell working on the manuscript between conversations with Bill Moyers: it feels like this book works out some of the open questions raised in The Power of Myth.What a brilliant book! By turns thought-provoking and breathtaking, I found myself rethinking many long-held ideas. And this for someone who has read and seen many Campbell works in the past.The last chapter, The Way of Art, really flattened me. Campbell writes thoughout his work of the mythic role of the artist, but here is the clearest statement of the artist's power and responsibility."
5,The Artist and The Mystic,"Especially interesting is the explication of James Joyce's definitions of ""proper"" and ""improper"" art.""Improper art is of two orders: art that excites desire for the represented object, and art that arouses loathing or fear of it. Art that excites desire, Joyce calls pornographic. All advertising art is in this sense pornographic....""""All improper art, whether pornographic or didactic, thus moves one to action... whereas proper art is static. We speak of esthetic arrest. One is not moved to physical action of any kind, but held in sensational (esthetic) contemplation and enjoyment.""""It is this elevation of mind and, with the mind, the eye, above desire and loathing, desire and fear, that brings the way of art and the artist inot relation to that of the mystic."" (pp. 123-4)"
3,Tracking a legend,"There are few songs in the world that stop you in your tracks and render you speechless of mind and heart. Billie Holiday sang one of them. The combination of her signature smoky vocals and the stark lyrics of the song written by Abel Meeropol, a white Jewish schoolteacher in the Bronx, proved to be spellbinding. Its emotional charge stirred activists and intellectuals and even popular notoriety. Margolick's biography of the song is a slim volume but full of interest, well-written and researched."
1,Buy Hal Leonard Funk bass playalong instead,"I bought this book to supplement my other funk/slap bass play-along books. Waste of money. Yes, there are a few decent licks and ideas, but the play-along c.d. is embarrassingly awful. If you ever played Playstation video games 10 years ago, then you will agree the c.d. is reminiscent of the Spyro the Dragon soundtracks. Cheesy drums and keyboard. With technology today, at least get some real drum loops in there and change the tone of the casio keyboard. Also, there are no real songs that anyone would recognize when you get through each section. More fusion based chord progressions that end up sounding the same very quickly. Buy Hal Leonard, which progresses very nicely and you will end up playing songs from Earth Wind and Fire, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and The Commodores :Brick House! I knew I should have listened to the reviews. Hopefully I can save someone some money with my review!"
1,Not reconditioned at all---,I just received my DW618R. Was planning on using it this weekend. It arrived loose in a Dewalt labeled box. I tested it immediately and the speed control did not work at all. Looked at the knob and it was obviously busted. The router was quite dirty and the centering tool was missing the shaft. It sure appears that Dewalts recon facility - in Mexico - just put it in a box and shipped it with no recon AT ALL. Would not recommend Dewalt reconned products at this time. Will see how Amazon handles this - not Amazon's fault.
2,Re-Conditoned or what ??,"This item was advertised as reconditioned but it was simply used. Or maybe I should say, pre-owned. The base was way scratched, the body was way dirty, and the only thing that made me feel good, is that it came in the original box."
2,Can't see it to tell time...,"I ordered this watch because I love the color purple. When it arrived, it seemed darker than the picture shown. I had a hard time making out the black watch hands on the purple background. I also had to squint to see the markings that replace the numbers. I am shipping it back."
4,Awesome,Simply brilliant! My son had lot of fun putting up the stars and planets in his room. They glow for atleast 10 mins after you switch off the light source.
5,just great!,"if you kid into planets and you don't mind wall decorations, this is must have. My son is 4.5 and loves TMBG: How Many Planets? song and space jigsaw puzzle. So he was thrilled to have the planets' line up over his bed and I never had an easier time to get him to sleeping routine. As soon as he saw it, he just went right to bed without any tantrums, or reinforcements, or pleading from my part. The stars glow very well and for 15+ min even after a short (2-5min) exposure to light. I think that planets glow just enough. No colors are seen in the dark, so planets are more interesting to look at and differentiate in the light anyway."
3,"Nice, but don't stick well.","These glow and look nice. That is, as long as they stay stuck to the ceiling. My kid'd set fell off the ceiling the first night they had them up. I would probably look for a better brand or something."
5,STARS STARS AND MORE STARS!,ANOTHER CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A SPECIAL YOUNG LADY! SHE'S INTO THE PLANETS AND WILL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF FUN ATTACHING THEM TO HER CEILING. CAN'T WAIT FOR HER TO OPEN THIS GIFT ON CHRISTMAS MORN!
1,This is not what i expected,The book contains about 75 (very) short essays that suppose to be about contrary thinking...Well after about the 10th essay - they all have more or less the same thing to say....I was not able to get any significant tangable benifit out of this book....As a matter of fact one of the few books I did not finish - not worth the time (got about 1/2 way).
4,Will this Book make you rich?,Or will it merely make you a cranky loner?I read this book and have learned the value of consistent questioning the validity of my assumptions. I am involved in a business that is on the bleeding edge of technology. You must question and re-question everything on a frequent basis or you will find yourself yesterday's news. Will this book help you to develop the approach to be successful? YES. The rest is up to you.
1,an instant candidate for the round file,Another abysmal reprint of mind numbing market lore from days gone by. Not worth the time to open. Read Gustave le Bon and learn something useful. Line the birdcage with this.
2,Don't misunderstand the aim of the book!,The book is not about technical analysis of stocks. It's about a way of analyzing socio-economic trends. The way it was presented and also other books I read by the same author misleaded me.
2,Not as good as the first album,In my humble opinion Basiclos rushed to produce their second CD; using material of inferior quality (compared to the first one). I was disappointed on expending my money in this album. I will think twice before purchasing their next album.
1,"Yes, where the music is Oliverb12 from Miami, FL","This is the worst album of the year, this album isnt worth a cent. This is the poorest recording weve heard in years, in fact, one of the hits was based on the reality of Miami,This is the true fact of all:This is another example of where the music industry stands: in the bottom of the toilet. Come on people, is the same people in Miami, with the same brainless arrangements, the foolish and silly lyrics, the overproduced Casio quality recordings, and the poor artistic vision of its musicians. When is it going to end? No more good music comes from Latin America; it's all monopolized by the same people in the Estefan network. These individuals must be pushed away from the music scene. Latin America won't be able to grow into one big nation because the big media and entertainment companies are ruled by poor, unimaginative, uninspired, unoriginal, untalented, ignorant, illiterate, and uneducated low class professionals."
1,Only one good song,"Except for ""Caraluna"", the best song in the album, the remaining ones are not very interesting. If you are buying because you heard ""Caraluna"", you would do better by downloading just that song and saving $15 for another album."
5,They're the best!!,"If you love latin music you'll love this album, and ifyou don't, it's about time you get a feeling of latin soul.They have the power to put down in music and words a blendof rhythm and feelings from the heart.""El edificio"", a song that you'll keep on singing over andover again. It makes you think....you have to listen to it!!"
2,Not helpful for our particular needs,This book could be helpful to others experiencing puzzling behaviors in small children. It wasn't particularly helpful in our situation - dealing with a teenager. I still do not understand the difference between non verbal learning disability and asperger syndrome which is why I bought the book. The symptoms are so similar that separating them into two syndromes seems to add to the puzzle rather than be helpful.
2,disappointed,"This book was limited to the author's experience with her own child and at times it appeared that she was bragging about her son, her life, her lifestyle etc. We don't all have unlimited funds to pick and choose private schools.............etc. Then, the author picks up and moves the whole household to find a different school that she heard might be good. Regular families struggling with NLD and autism don't often have the funds to do all this and it made me put down the book feeling less understood than before. Advice in the book was same as you would find in an intro book about the disorder."
4,an intimate recording,"This CD features laura the way the love her most, just her and her piano with a simple harmony group, live and intimate, and in great voice. For newcomers to the genius of laura nyro, this may not be the best intro. For experienced fans, the live version of emmie alone makes this one worthwhile."
5,Laura's gift to the city she loved,"These are two of Laura's Christmas eve shows she would do for her NYC fans. Both are very intimate disc 1 '93 and disc 2 '94 which was her last it also featured songs from her last album which wasn't released at the time. Once again we find just Laura and her piano but on these she has three singers with her. Both of these are beautiful showing just how wonderful this woman was the passion that she performs these songs is wonderful. Put these on and back with your favorite drink and person and enjoy a great American treasure that left us way too early. I have always loved to listen to these on Christmas eve, a Christmas tradtion of mine."
3,Satisfied,"I'm not familiar with this genre so perhaps my comments are useless, but I was expecting more thorough explanations (after every few moves) rather than the occasional alternative lines."
3,World Greatest chess games,"The notations are descriptive and not algebric if you are comfotable with it, I purchased it without realizing it how ever its ok to have one in descriptive notations.Shahzeb Mistry"
1,"Terrible book, lacking any value-added features","A very ethical friend of mine recently submitted a detailed review of all the errors contained in this book, including transposition(s) without acknowledgement.I've reviewed his work carefully, and I have confirmed that the authors' claim to have used computer analysis to aid them in creating some sort of update is patently false.This laziness from players of GM strength, not to mention the foreward by Anand, a World Champion, should not be tolerated by the chess reading public....Suffice it to say, many games contain outright five or more analytical errors and ommissions that render past so called masterpieces merely ordinary games by today's standards.The inspiration you should take from this is that you can also play as well as yesterday's masters.I would give this book to a junior or a beginner if it cost less than [money], and if he were stuck on a desert island."
5,Wonderfully charming stories. An unusual writer.,"Eva Ibbotson is a wonderfully charming writer with memorable and funny characters. Yes, as the review above states, her stories are as light and sweet as the Viennese desserts she often refers to, but her heroines are not sacharine or dull. But, let's face it, who would you rather spend your afternoon with: charming, witty and fun characters or someone from Hannibal? Ibbotson developes characters with personalities you want to meet and know. I highly recommend Glove Shop as well as any and all of her books, her adult ones as well as her juvenile fiction. Let's face it, if you like books filled with ""throbbing and panting"" or congealed blood Ms. Ibbotson is not the writer for you."
2,Poorly handled by Amazon,"Description said B7HS. Product that arrived was B7HS-10.Plugs were out of sockets, rattling in the box. This might have damaged insulators.Packaging slip included in the shipment shows lower price than what I was charged and what shows on the invoice."
4,"Condensed, but that's why it's called a Pocket Guide...",Good overview and quick read on the subject. It is a great resource if you are just starting a study on Islam or if you need a quick review. Does not go into too much detail so that is where it is lacking but I think that was the purpose for writing this book.Because it gives a fair understanding of Islam and I believe accomplished what it wanted to be.
2,Biased and unfair,"I found this book to be very biased, and factually incorrect, especially the chapter on women. Some other topics were correct, but this degree of bias is inexcusable."
2,Waste of Time,The only thing worth watching in this movie is Kelly Sullivan and the poor girl was given a terrible script to work with. Watch if you're a fan but otherwise run for the hills! Wasn't even worth the rental fee.
3,Formulaic and uninspired but decent acting & special effects,"If you want to study stock plots, standard characters and typical cliffhangers in Republic chapterplays, this is a good academic excesize. But it is a VERY mediocre example of Republic serials generally.... While ANYTHING from Republic's unit was better than 90% of the serials from other studios, SECRET SERVICE IN DARKEST AFRICA (the original title)was perhaps the beginning of the end of the Golden Age. All but three chapters are carbon-copies of one another: two 4-man fistfights (each beginning with Rex Bennet getting the pistol knocked out of his hand) per episode, one shot of the captive Sultan Ben Ali mocking his Nazi captors, a cross-country chase and an explosion at the end. Sure, these are the staples of serialdom, but here they are presented as ""bones without flesh."" For wartime Nazi-fighters in the serials, Spy Smasher (or any similar Whitney-directed outing) is a better choice."
1,Choose another guide to AutoCAD,"One wonders if the person responsible for the ""editorial review"" actually ever read the book and/or tried to use the exercise manual. Both text and manual are replete with inaccuracies, misspellings, grammatical gobbledygook and, of course, worst of all for the student, incorrect, incomplete or, in numerous cases, altogether missing instructions/directions. The book appears as if it went unedited, or surely some of the errors would've been corrected?? The price tag is too high for a text with so many problems. Consider an alternative (any alternative)."
4,A Solid Planner Book,"The North Cascades can be confusing when it comes to visiting due to how remote it is and frankly how over looked the North Cascades National Park is. Considering that there are a number of access points spread over a vast distance from Mt. Baker Hwy, Hwy 20, long forest service roads and Canada one can be stumped just where to go on a trip.Take a look at Erik's book to get an idea of what you might like to see (sub alpine? Deep forest? No people?) and then get out there!"
5,great to find old books,This book was one of my childhood favorites. I was glad to find a copy of it. It arrived in quick time and was in very good condition. I am glad some people are willing to find old books and offer them for sale.
4,HAPPY COSTUMER,This game is kind of weird. The controls to work it are a bit different then most games. But it is fun a bit hard for me but I'm not a good gamer XP. I would buy from this seller agian. It was fast delivery and the game worked fine.
2,Mis leading,this could have been a great video but instead was just a mix of fat ugly gay people. I was misled but the advertising and would not recommend this for anyone who might be heterosexual and just looking for something a little different. I felt this was something that should have been tagged as GAY ONLY.......
4,Wicked,"I sing for a cover band and we use these tunes all the time! Disc 4 is my current favorite. I don't give it a 5 because I think Rhino could have used more popular tunes from some of the artists - for example, when I think of Debbie Gibson (which believe me, isn't often), I think Lost In Your Eyes, but Only In My Dreams is on disc 7. And there's NO Talking Heads, NO Springsteen, NO Mellencamp...they say 80s to me, but I guess not to Rhino. They pulled it off alright, though I'd rather replace some of the fluff (Deniece Williams, Billy Crystal (ugh), Melissa Manchester (ugh again) with any of the above-named artists. There's more good than bad though and I really enjoy listening and performing most of these tunes."
4,Delicate CD's,"When it comes to music, one can look at the songs on the CD and decide whether they want to buy it or not based on their own individual tastes. Personally, I love most of the songs in this set and found it to be the best choice for myself.However, one thing I can advise about this particular boxed set is that I had some trouble removing the CD's from their holders. One CD in particular I had to pull pretty hard to remove it the first time, and it broke in half. I didn't pull THAT hard that it should have broke, but it did. First time in my life I had a CD break on me. If you buy this set, be careful removing the CD's from the box!"
5,"Ah, the 80s....","....although some of the biggest hits and stars are missing, notably Prince and Madonna, this collection will certainly bring back memories of the good, the bad, and the ugly from this tumultuous decade. A must-have for your music collection"
5,"Awesome, Eclectic Mix of Amazing Hits!!!!",This set has so many awesome songs! Each disc has about 20 songs on it (and there's 7 discs). Half of the songs you already know (and love) and the rest you'll love too once you hear them and learn them!
2,What the hell?,"As a compilation of course there will always be something missing...but no Pet Shop Boys? no Madonna? no DM? No New Order? No Michael Jackson? Maybe their record companies or the artists themselves did not allow their songs to be included here but seven discs and 90 bucks for a compilation missing these giants are almost a shame...As one of the reviewers pointed out, 60% good music and the rest is garbage- and that 60% is not wonderful music (for instances instead of Broken Wings, Kyrie by Mr. Mister etc etc)"
2,missing tracks,"lots of great 80's music available in these cds, but missing one of the greatest groups of the decade...Wham!"
3,"Like Omigod, a sticky mess!","I was so excited when this set was released. I initially thought the pacakaging was super cool as well. However, a few months have passed now and I feel quite differently. The rubber cover on the front of the box is curling up and peeling off of the cardboard, exposing a very sticky mess underneath. I emailed Rhino to complain about this and was told to either take it off and try to clean the whole thing with rubbing alcohol (meaning there would be no more cool rubber cover), try to reglue it (I don't see that working given its present state of stickiness), or I could send them the box back (at my expense) and wait 4-6 weeks for a replacement. Why? So the next one can come unglued too..... next time they need to investigate their materials further."
2,just ok,Although this set has a good selection of 80's music i don't feel it included a lot of songs that are better than what it has. I really like the 70's version of this set though.
2,"Good compilation, awful sound","Some of my downloads from Kazaa sound better than the songs on this collection. I doubt that Rhino used the master tapes for this set as most songs have serious imperfections. That's a shame because the songs selection is very good. After listening to three or four songs, my ears start ringing. This collection is probably more suitable for car listening on long trips. For this reason I will never buy another Rhino collection. Period."
2,Songs I Never Want To Hear Again,"That's I would have called it. A DJ at a cheesey wedding could plug one of these in a take a long break.It was certainly the most popular music of the times, but not really the best.The bright side is I can finally not buy them all at the same time, and thats convenient."
4,Really great,I thought this was a really good set. it admittedly is missing some of the other good songs. but it has a really good variety and hits a lot of the popular ones i haven't been able to find in any store.
5,The 80's collection to have!,"This is the only set you need :) This well pacakged set of 7 CD's even includes a fairly thick booklet of happenings and events from the 80's.Great for a trip down memory lane. The audio quality was quite good as well.I'd looked at several other sets of 80's music, but I'm very glad I got this one. It was well worth the money spent!"
3,Women at risk - can these women be saved?,"It takes a while to gain my interest and sympathy, andthe 3 main characters are slightly stereotypical: the girlchasing a married man, the aging diva who refuses to grow upand lives through her daughter, and the (ugh)generous prostitutewith a heart of gold. Also the sex scenes feel a little gratuitous,and there is an undertone of paranoia which makes this a scaryfilm - this is definitely not a film for kids. What redeemsthis film is seeing how two of them manage to save themselves frombad situations. The filmmakers don't take the easy way out bycondemning all religious fundamentalists. If you want to know whythe mother is so paranoid about religion, read the novels of YasminaKhadra (like In the Name of God)In the Name of Godand Tahar Djaout (Last Summer of Reason).The Last Summer of Reason"
5,Cute gift,"I got this for a cat-loving co-worker and it is really cute. The graphics are good quality and the pad itself is also okay. Mostly, this is just a fun desk accessory."
3,Disappointing but solid,"I was somewhat disappointed by this game, as a longtime Jazz Jackrabbit player and Jazz Jackrabbit 2 (an infinitely superior PC game) addict. It's a solid platformer, but lacks the personality and humor that makes Jazz Jackrabbit games traditionally excellent. I was unable to bring myself to finish the game, in fact, in the first few sittings. Still, as long as one does not get their hopes up too much, Jazz Jackrabbit is a great game. But try its distant PC cousins first."
3,So far it's ok.,This book was still written by a white man so it still has biased points of view. So far it's okay.
4,Mayan women eaten by dogs (greyhounds),"The book is a detailed analysis of the great brutality and massacre practiced in the Americas. Whatever the causes behind a massacre is, it is unacceptable. The book gives a whole lot of information in a novel style. The events in the book is sometimes very disgusting and unbearable. His accusation of Turks for massacring Armenians does not rely on strong evidences but rather on some books of Armenian authors. As a whole the book shows the background of the prosperity and power of todays. I strongly recommend this book to be read."
5,eye opener,"this book is amazing, it opens ur eyes to a whole new light on history of the americas u never would of known unless u went out of school and researched this topic on your own. shows who the real moraly uncivilized savages wer. everyone native to the ""americas"" and caribean should read this book and learn the TRUTH about columbus and european invasion."
5,It has freed me from nationalist impulses.,"A difficult work to read, because it is so horrifying. It shows that our forebears not only had feet of clay, but that clay is blood and bones of indigenes. No longer need I regret not living now where my ancestors trod, perhaps two centuries ago, because the land they trod then was not theirs, and likely had been taken by force, misadventure or trick from the commons of ""native Americans."""
2,I do not reccomend this book,"I found this book to not only be boring, but rather inaccurate in its information as well. Stannard writes a completely biased perspective of our history and presents misleading facts."
2,Lost in the Wild.,I don't know what came first whether it was Lost the TV series or this movie but neither appeal to me. Same predictable rubbish and music? Not for me. Regards Stewart. 27-05-10
1,?????,Ordered this months ago and still have not recieved?? It looked like it was going to be a good movie?
2,Disappointing...,"I waited too long to watch this so I couldn't send it back. I wanted to add to my large movie collection but this disc skips, sticks and is horrible."
4,It is not as good as Angel eyes or Maid in Manhatten,But is good for my collection.The quality was great and this movie is almost my Fav. It also got here super quick in spite of the holidays. Where else can you get this service without hunting everywhere.rita-MN
3,Not Terrible,"I rented this film because it stars Lindsay Wagner, and I'm a huge fan of hers. That said, this movie was just okay. Wagner was wonderful as always, but the rest of the cast was stiff and the dialog stilted. I doubt I'll watch it again, which is something I rarely say when it comes to a Wagner film. Definitely don't see any need to own this one."
5,AWESOME!!!,Got it when I was suppose to . Have been a Huge Fan of Movies so finding this movie was awesome. Would buy from you again!
3,Jennifer Lopez's second movie,"First of all i've saw this movie yesterday under the name : LOST IN THE WILD which runs 2 minutes longer than Nurses on the Line: The Crash of Flight 7.this movie has potential because has good shots(was filmed in Mexico),very good cast,good soundtrack,interesting scenery but it had been more entertaining if it was an intersection between the drug dealer and the nurses and if it was a love story between the adventure.that's are my only discontent.robert loggia and jennifer lopez were awesome and the other cast too.i've read in other commentaries about this movie that jennifer lopez has a minor role but this is not true.if think that her real fans will enjoy her in this movie.She brings beauty and talent to this movie.i wanted her to speak more in spanish in this movie but are not so many ocasions into this movie for doing that.so all in all it is a pretty good movie that could have been a much better movie even a classic one if the story had been more intriguing."
3,tools seem great,"tools see great, child hasn't played with yet because this is christmas gift. the box was all smashed and damaged which stinks a little since this is christmas gift."
5,great toy for both 5 and 3 yr old,Haven't used them outside yet but they seem to be very sturdy and made well esp for the price. We cannot wait to use them outside in the spring and summer.
2,Not made in USA,"This item was listed under the ""Made in USA"" search, so thinking this was true, I ordered it. When I received the item I checked the label on the back of the box and it is made in China!! Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!"
1,Damaged in 15 minutes!,"I bought these tools for my 6 year old son as he loves to help in the garden. We were looking for metal and wood tools that would be durable. My son is not hard on toys and takes good care of his things. We took the tools out of the package and he was so excited that he immediately started digging in the garden. 15 minutes later the shovel was bent in half! I was able to bend it back with just my hands, but this shovel won't cut it!Another big disadvantage of these tools is that the handles are so short. They are made for ages 5 and up, but are way too short for my 6 year old. A complete waste of money!"
2,be careful with these tools!,I purchased this set for my 3 yr old daughter because she likes to help out with yard work. These tools are sharp! She was using them one morning (with supervision !!) and she slipped on the wet grass and hit the edge of the shovel with her shin. We spent the next few hours in the ER with a clean slice to her leg. Beware when you purchase these that they should be used with supervision as they are sharp!
2,Shovel handle broke off,"The gardening tools seem to be of good quality but when my 5 year old son tried to use the shovel to dig a hole, the screw pulled out of the handle. My husband re-screwed it in, but the hole wouldn't hold. He's going to try and drill the screw in and we'll see if it holds. As it is, I can't recommend. I wish I could because they're a great size and my son loved them but now he's pretty disappointed."
3,"REAL garden tools, REAL sharp!","While these are high-quality tools, they are real--just miniature ""big people"" garden tools. They have wooden handles and metal parts. BEWARE! They are very sharp and are not suitable for children unless supervised. I purchased them for a four-year-old and had I known how sharp they are, I would have opted for a cheaper, plastic version. If you want your child to do some actual gardening, these would be perfect; but if they are for play, be very, very cautious."
3,Kids' Garden Tools,"We purchased this set for our son at Christmas time and it is no longer usable. The screws have come out many times and it's getting harder and harder to keep them tight enough to keep the metal on the wooden handle. Admittedly, our son plays very hard with his outdoor toys, but these have bent up rather quickly. When he does play with them, he adores them! So, in the name of being parents, we just keep fixing them to keep our guy happy!"
3,handles too short for a 4 yr. old,"My daughter received these as a gift for her 4th birthday. I was immediately disappointed by how short the handles are. I can't believe the mfr. states 5+ yrs. old. My daughter is of average height for her age, so I'm quite disappointed and will likely return these. I saw another set like this on forsmallhands.com that are similar, but have longer handles. I am surprised the reviews are so positive for older children w/ these garden tools.Overall quality is good. These will be fine and of proper use for a smaller child."
4,Look sturdy,Haven't really had our kids spend a lot of time playing with these but they seem very sturdy and are a good size.
3,"Love the toys, but quality poor","Bought 2 sets of these for my 2 and 4 year old. I thought that they looked like they would last them for ever. I loved that they had a wooden handle and they were metal. My kids are kind of hard on there garden tools so I was hoping for the best. But it's been almost 2 months and 2 of the tools are already down. The hoe's head came off while helping in the garden looks like they just didn't weld it very good and the the straight rake has got bent teeth. If you kids aren't tough on there garden tools these are great, and maybe we just got a lemon batch, Just wished they would of lasted a little longer."
3,"Lots of fun, but not very durable in real use","My son loved these ""real"" tools. He used them in the garden with dad and I. Unfortunalty, these seem to be better suited for pretend. After a short time the tops came off of the handles. We had to screw them back on. They were a lot of fun but I wish they had lasted longer."
4,Kids Garden Tool Set,"I bought for our 4 yr. old grandson. He loves to help his mother in the garden. They just put a rather large garden in on their property and he was in heaven w/ his tools. They are sturdy. Can be dangerous if not supervised. Handles are wood, tool itself is metal and sharp. Not for a young child who is not focused, the child MUST be supervised as I stated. I would buy for another child and recommend this product.Kids Garden Tool Set"
4,good product,My 3 year old son loves using the rakes and hoe in the dirt and sand. He gets to help mom and dad outside too. The tools are pretty durable so far and are more realistic than the plastic kind.
1,Not very sturdy,"I was very disappointed. My 4-year-old daughter loves working in the garden with me. The shovel broke on the first use (it's just a small screw in a plastic handle), and the tines on the rake are bent."
2,"Great Concept, Poor Implementation",I love the concept of this set but was disappointing in the final product. The rake tines are too narrow and stiff to be used effectively and the shovel head is too flat to actually scoop dirt with - it could use more curvature or some sort of raised edge. I think the hoe will be most useful as it seems well weighted and sized appropriately. The handles on the shovel and rake could be a bit longer too - better to grow into rather than out of so quickly. I suspect I will be replacing the tiny screws used to attach the tool heads; they seem flimsy and most already have too much wiggle in them.
3,Godd but fall aaprt easy.,"My 3.5 yo got these for Christmas, which was yesterday. He used the shovel today and the screws have already come loose. The screw was small and only about a half inch long. We have replaces the screws with longer ones and slightly bigger.Overall not bad and fun for the kiddo but not made to last. Especially if you have a child that *loves* digging and using the tools!"
2,Appears great but not durable.,"The product looked great on arrival but immediately noticed that the tools were not attached properly to the handles. Every one of the four had play where they attached. Also, I was surprised to see that these toys were metal with hard wooden handles, which would be great if the metal had any strength. Within the first hour, my 4 year old grandson had bent both rake heads"
1,LIARS,"I'm disgusted because I been ripped- off, this is not the german ATROCITY we know and love featuring Alex Krull, this is a hack band from Philly, so please dont think this a real release from Atrocity, They are known for surprise EP'S and singles between albums so its easy to get fooled,their should be some quality control so that does'nt happen, how they got away with this in these days of copyright control!After listening to it it really sounds ok at first, but the barking pit bull hard core vocals really make it sound like every east coast tuff guy band, ther are some death/grind moments but not enough in 18 minutes, I would give 3 stars but because of the rip-off name I cant respect it 1 is all.."
4,Very fresh product,"Received these quickly by prime and have not had the quality problem that other reviewers have noted. The nuts are all a good large size and the package had a good expiration date. Did take off one star because the shells seem to be harder to crack than the ones I have had before, could be because I'm getting older."
1,Why is so hard to find good nuts,"I bought 3 5lb bags and the nuts are small and look like they went through a grinder,and mediocre taste.Wish I hadn't of got 3 bags.Look else were."
1,"If you like small peanuts, this is your brand","Quality of the peanuts are okay (on a quality rating scale of okay, good and fine) but the size of the peanuts are the smallest I have found in my local grocery chains. I only buy this brand when I am desperate...so if you are desperate, buy away or if you are a fan of small, okay peanuts then look no more, you have found your peanut utopia.Otherwise, keep on looking...."
1,Good nut bad store,"Be very careful of the store ""TheNewMall"" who will charge $9.00 for the nuts and $37.00 to ship it! Rip off company!"
1,Low quality nuts,These are low quality small nuts. Not very good tasting and small. Alot of the peanuts were also bad and shell cracked. I threw out more than I ate. Don't waste your money.
2,won't buy again,"I buy salted peanuts in the shell once a year, for the All-Star game (baseball). I picked up the 1 LB bag at (wally world) and it seemed like there were about 50% acceptable peanuts. The other 50% were tiny, missing, or tasted bad. I will be looking for another brand next year."
1,Moldy Shells,"I've been buying the generic Jewel Foods brand peanuts the past 9 months to get my daughter to have more protein in her diet. When Hampton came out with the baseball labels, I bought the Cubs since I lived on the North side of Chicago almost 20 years near Wrigley Field, not really a baseball fan but a peanut fan that lived on the North side of Chicago. Anyway, so many of the peanuts were moldy on the outside shell (threw them out), or shriveled and black on the inside(threw them out), or not roasted enough and had that moist bite you don't want in a salted roasted peanut. Very disappointing I will continue to buy the store generic brand which was much better in consistency, taste, roasted and salted quality. Being a Chicagoan my whole life I did wonder if the Cubs bag got the rejects. Only added to the fact that I won't buy these again."
4,as described,bought for my squirrrel feeder - they certainly loved it along with the bluejays who were just waiting for me to leave. I enjoyed them too.
4,Good for the money~,"Peanuts were good for the money, had a few dry ones, but overall very good product. I will buy them again."
4,Eye opening,"An excellent read for those seeking a truly healthy lifestyle. The author's theories are backed by research and common sense. I am thankful to him for having written it. The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is that there is no clear alternative offered for readers who can't afford to travel and take part in an initial induction fast. That said, the useful information contained in the book is invaluable."
1,Dont waste your money,"Book is full of ""stories"" but little info that relates to the Title and subtitle. Disappointing. Description claims groundbreaking ways to change your life, diet and health. Shopping with a list and drinking lots of water isn't so groundbreaking in my opinion."
3,Dr. Doug Lisle The Pleasure Trap,It was a very informative book though somewhat dry. The Kindle version was incomplete so there were some pages that were missing. I learned a lot from the book and would definitely recommend it.
5,Very insightful,"Having recently read Joel Furhman's Eat to Live, I have already been convinced by the data supporting this book's dietary recommndations. What Lisle & Goldhamer offer are penetrating insights into why we are so reluctant to change our eating habits. Explaining our reluctance in terms of our most basic biological drives, motivations that we share with every living species on the planet, was remarkable. Each chapter holds a couple of ""gems"" where I thought, ""That makes perfect sense--why didn't I think of that?""This is an amazing book that has the potential to give every reader a new perspective, and greater understanding into his or her own behavior."
1,Lie,"I bought this dvd box, because it contained the Spanish language and subtitles. that was a lie. I lost my money."
3,BATTERIES DIE QUICKLY,MY 12 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER IS HAVING A GREAT TIME WITH THIS CAMERA...THE ONLY PROBLEM WE ARE HAVING IS THIS IS THE FIRST DAY SHE HAS PLAYED WITH IT AND SHE HAS GONE THROUGH SEVERAL AA BATTERIES...BEST TO GET THE RECHARGEABLE ONES WITH THE CAMERA.
3,flip video,Nice for quick video on the fly - certainly easy to upload and share. Not the best quality - but then again - it's really not meant for that.
3,Convenient product,"The Flip Video is perfect for recording quick bits of video. It's handy and easy to use. It definitely is not as good as a camcorder - the sound quality is not great and it doesn't zoom very far. It can record for about an hour and the picture quality is decent. Downloading the videos to a computer is simple and it keeps with some pre-loaded software which allows you to edit, email, save, and make photos from the videos. It's a good product and fun to play around with. It's very light - lighter than a camera and is about the size of a camera. It is very easy to send video clips with this product."
5,Perfect!,Bought this for my 17 year old daughter. She is a facebook/myspace addict and this was the perfect way to enable her to video her friends and immediately download to her account. It was so easy! The picture is clear and the unit is easy to hold.
5,"Easy to use, fun to have!","This was purchased for my 10 year old who is a director in the making. All of the group of friends have them and they have made several little movies. It is a ""take it out of the box and shoot"" type of thing. I would recommend it for someone who doesn't want to pay a whole lot but just wants to have fun. I guess there are more expensive/newer models but this one fit my purpose perfectly."
4,Great camera for the price,"Basically you just take this camera out of the box, insert batteries and it's ready to record! The Flip camera fits easily into my purse and I have captured some awesome video moments that otherwise would have been missed!Sometimes if you are recording a large group the sound quality is not as good as with a traditional video camera, but the picture quality comes out great!I am a ""techno-idiot"" and managed to hook it up to my computer and download the videos within a few minutes. Very easy to hook and play on a t.v. screen as well."
5,flip camcorder,"item received better then expected. kids are having a great time recording and viewing themselves on computer and tv. definitely recommend as a low cost , fun video recorder"
2,Not as useful or as easy to use as it should be,"I gave this as a present to a gadget person. He was excited about it, at first. Then, as he gradually discovered its limitations (limited lens, not great software) it became something that will sit in a box. I was sorry I bought it."
1,BEWARE save your money!,"This thing is absolute crap, with even worse support from the manufacturer and Amazon. I returned it, at my expense, to the maker b/c Windows wouldn't recognize it. A month later it comes back to me WITHOUT the accessories I shipped it with. Now it has the same problem again, and Amazon says I'm past the return date--yeah, by one week, and because the camcorder was supposedly being repaired.Don't buy this piece of garbage."
5,Great Value for the Money,"We've had a good experience with this little camera. After a little research (downloaded DivX for Mac) I was able to figure out how to make it compatible with my Mac and iMovie and now I can make wonderful little home movie DVDs at home. It doesn't have the same quality that you'd get in, say, a $500 camera, but for the money, it takes a very nice picture and has good sound quality. Easy to operate - we are really thrilled with it!"
1,"Great Product, Really bad software","Based on the overwhelming positive reviews on this site I purchased the FLIP Video. I got it home and right out of the box the FLIP Video itself worked great. However, once I connected the device to my laptop (fairly new Dell PC running Windows XP) the software would not work with my computer as advertised. I tried everything I could think of for over a half hour and it still would not work. I ended up just taking it back to the store for a refund. In this case it really was too good to be true."
3,Locked Software Can not make your own DVDs,"When I first bought this product I like to use it. BUT having to go to a drug store with incompdent people who do not know what they are doing, takes over 45 min.+++ to download and burn a DVD from the camera at $13.00 per DVD gets time consuming and expensive. And sometimes they don't work and improperly trained people have lost and erase some special family moments from the camera. The software on these cameras are locked. So the company owns the rights to your home made movies. You can not duplicate the DVDs you had made with out paying an additional $13 per copy or download and burn DVDs yourself on your home computer. They will download to your computer so you can view them only or email them to a friend, but they take up a lot of space on your hard drive. I suggest investing in a better camera. These are pretty much disposable. Editing is also a joke with this camera. You get what you pay for, no bargin here."
3,Flip Top Video,"I bought two 60 minute Flip Top Videos for my grandchildren for Christmas(9 years old and 12 years old). They are thrilled and use them night & day making up their own little movies and programs. After two weeks one of the Flip Tops started deleting everything and showing only 35 seconds available. Although it is a wonderful concept and one is still working, I am very disappointed to have spent that much money only to have it breakdown in two weeks time. My granddaughter is also very disappointed."
5,Can't get more bang for the buck,You get what you pay for and more. This is SO easy to use and does a great job. I highly recommend this product.
5,I love this camcorder,"I love this camcorder. I purchased it online so that I could use it to record my stand up and upload it to you tube and it has not let me down yet. The only thing bad I would say is you must keep a lot of batteries with you if you are going to use it as much as I do because you need AA batteries to power it up. But I honestly think this is the best invention ever well besides the microwave, well there's the car and the stop light and how about the ...well you get the point its a really nice camcorder and it's afforable."
4,"GREAT item, BUT...","Item received in a timely fashion, which was important because I was traveling between military bases, BUT I was not happy with the fact that it did not come with a manual. Yes, you can ""point, shoot and view,"" but it took quite a bit of figuring to know how to snap pics from video, figure out it would be 3x faster if it was transferred into a ""movie"" format before uploading, etc... I still don't know if I add music will it over-ride words. Also, I am UNHAPPY with the fact that all though I have marked all mine private, that has not been the case... PLEASE NOTE that none of these things have anything to do with the company from whom I purchased it. I would rate their processing and expediting the order A+. My complaints have to do with the manufacturer. I would gladly have paid more for a manual to have been included or be accessible online in adobe format, etc."
1,doesn't work,"Ok it's christmas morning. I open up the camera, take some family videos. Works fine I try to download them to my mac - which is in specifications. I'm running 10.4. bogs down, spinning icon, nothing - locks up the machine.I try another mac that has more disk space (try the obvious) same issues.I go to the flip phone site - guess what, it reports it needs new firmware which isn't available until sometime in jan. (no specific date)Companies that sell you things in December that they know don't work / won't work until jan. should be taught a lesson.THIS IS JUST WRONG.I rated it one star because amazon won't le4t me rate it zero)"
1,Doesn't work well with Macintosh computers,"I really like the idea of a cable-free, simple camcorder. However, it doesn't work well with Macs running Tiger (OS 10.4) and is barely usable with Macs running Leopard (OS 10.5). The company's technical support says (in an email) ""The Flip Video camera does not support Mac OSX Leopard (OSX 10.5.x), so we cannot guarantee that the Flip Video program will have full functionality."" It doesn't even have the ability to easily export videos to a Mac. Great disappointment. Hopefully, future releases will fix this glaring problem."
4,Solid Product,"Pro's-really easy to use, plugs in quickly to your TV using the included cable. My 8 year old daughter uses the camera more than I do and I love that fact.Con's-Could not get the software to work on XP.Wishes - 1)Wish it had a better focus. In videotapping my daughter's soccer game, video still seemed far away from the action though I was right on the sideline. 2)Some form of anti-shake technology, because its so small and I just naturaly shake, it is sometimes hard to keep the camera steady, which is clearly reflected in my video."
4,Tough and easy,"I've had this camera about three months. While the picture quality isn't as good as my 3ccd camcorder the Flip suffices for TV displays. All the software for PC and Mac resides on the camera. The USB connector is part of the camera and flips (thus the name) out to plug into a computer port. It's so easy to use that's it's sort of the iPod of the camcorder business. My four year old grandson has taken some pretty good videos on it with minimal instruction. It fell twice off a four foot table to concrete and it still runs. The second time the plastic case separated, but I easily snapped it back in place. I'm more careful now, but it's nice to know that you don't have to worry too much about damage. It uses two AA batteries and they last over an hour, or the time it takes to fill its 1GB internal memory. No zoom, but, if you've watched enough amateur home movies with zoom, you'll avoid zoom nausea."
5,Pocket Video Camera,"The Flip Video is great for recording up to one hour worth of video. It is perfect for families who want to share videos. I found that the sound quality is ok. The zoom is adequate but not great. And the picture quality is good for its price. The better the lighting you have, the better the quality of the video taken. It even looks good when watched on a TV screen. No sense lugging around a camcorder when you can carry this small video camera. It is so easy to use that no instruction manual is necessary and I am not electronic savvy. It comes with all you need, including TV connector cable, carrying case, wrist strap and even the batteries."
5,"So Easy to Operate, Even for Technically Challenged!","I can't believe how easy this is to operate. Fits in a purse with no problem, so you always have it with you for those great moments. Clarity is A+++ and downloading is a snap....I finally found what I needed after many $$$ and high end camcorders. This is the cat's meow."
4,Great Little video!!!,"Purchased my Flip Video 2 wks ago. Love it! Handy size, picks up sounds really well, fits into pocket or purse, sturdy, easy to download to computer - just plug it in; or to TV...looks even better on TV. If I could wish for anything that could improve it I would say I wish it had a little more zoom. Other than that, for the price and convenience it is perfect."
1,Flip video camcorder,Overall the Flip was easy to use and very compact. However the sceen was hard if not impossible to see in bright daylight. Batteries quit prior to using up the 60 minute of recording time.
2,Mac Users Beware - Flip Video Clips are difficult to edit,The Flip Camcorder creates AVI files which iDVD and iMovie can not read. I had to purchase QuickTime but I am still having problems. The UI that comes with Flip does not work with Leopard. The camera is user friendly and takes nice quality video. Removing video from camera to MAC is also a challenge. Flip needs to provide better support to MAC users.
4,My flip.,"Flip video is fairly easy to use. I am held back a little by my computer illiteracy, but that can be fixed. Well worth what I paid for it."
5,The Flip Video Camcorder is the BEST!,This is a wonderful little video camera! It fits easily in your pocket or in your purse. It's a camera full of fun! Since buying mine I've had four friends buy one too. It is easy to use and easy to download videos on your computer - everything you need is built inside the little camera. You can even capture photographs from the video you took. Everyone who sees this camera is amazed at it's capabilities. I love it! I highly recommend it. It is so easy to use!
5,easiest camcorder ever,"A week ago I bought the 120 minute Flip Ultra. Three days later I ordered another one for my wife. I don't want to share mine. The picture quality is fantastic and the sound even better (especially considering the small size (like a pack of 100 mm cigarettes). Contrary to another review I read, the software works just fine in my MAC laptop. It'll do everything that it does on our PC. I play back my clips on our 56 inch TV and the quality rivals network programing. I found this 2nd generation 120 minute Flip Ultra on Amazon for $129.I would highly recommend this camera, even over more expensive and sophisticated camcorders. DEAN"
4,BATTERY LIFE,"CAMERA STYLE PHOTOS/VIDEO ----------WORKS GREAT, BUT BATTERY LIFE SEEMS TO BE SHORT. MAKE SURE YOU CUT THE CANCORDER OFF YOURSELF RATHER THAB WAITING FOR IT TO CUT IT'S SELF OFF IS THE OLY ANSWER THAT I KNOW......."
5,A grandparent's best friend,"I got a flip video for my son and daughter-in-law at the other end of the country to keep me current on my grandson's life and growth. All they do is point and shoot, plug into their computer and download and send it to me as an email. So much better than photos! Cheap and easy for all of us. I liked it so much I got one for our end."
2,disappointed,"We are having trouble getting it to download to computer. Not as easy as the instructions say. The first day she used it it froze several times. We had to replace the batteries, which was not a big deal. But it froze again and we had to take batteries out and reinsert them. When it is working she really enjoys it. We are unable to save any of the videos as it is not working with our new computer."
5,"Easy, cheap, good video","I'm impressed! The video from this little camera is very good quality for the money. I have posted three videos on YouTube (TomBK3) that were made with it. I just plugged the Flip Video camera into the USB on the side of my Mac G4 iBook, dragged and dropped the video files from the camera's memory into iMovie, did some editing and saved the results in QuickTime. It's easy, works well and is convenient to carry in a pocket. I may use it more often than the HD camcorder I just bought, although the HD (obviously) has a much better picture, more features, etc."
4,A Fun Item,I have enjoyed using the Flip camcorder. It is small and light like a cell phone or an MP3 player. I wear it on my belt. The Flip camcorder simplifies making short bits of film records of my friends and places I visit. It's fun to bring along whenever I meet with people.
1,Download is impossible,"This product ""in theory"" is awesome.It promised to make my job of restaurant supervision much easier.The product that I purchased may be faulty.. but I cannot download or compress any video.My computer locks up and I cannot even ""safely eject"" or turn off the FLIP without a FIGHT.There is no support available... so I will return my FLIP this afternoon."
1,no thank you !,"i got this camera and have returned it because it didn't work. don't know when the money will be returned to me! there was a software glitch that they keep telling me that they can fix. however, it only played sound with no video. i have a an i book and wanted it so i can do things quick and easy... not with this product! try something else."
4,One For My Son...One For Me,"In my mind, this is a great video camera that you can keep with you at all times. It is nice for travel because it is small enough to fit into your shirt pocket. It takes AA batteries so there is never any need to carry a battery charger. AA batteries are available everywhere. That was one of the big selling points for me.The audio/video quality are good...not great. For the price, I think it is exceptional.It is simple to use and I love the USB connector that flips open and plugs right into the computer.I bought one for my son and liked it so well that I bought one for myself!"
4,Flip and Film - How Handy!!,"When I was introduced to the Flip Video camcorder at a conference, I was a bit skeptical that you actually could get decent videos from such a small and handy device. So, after reading all the reviews I could get my hands on, I purchased mine. It does all that is says it does which, although limited, is quite outstanding for its size. The only negatives that I could find were 1.) the limited zoom on it, and 2.) the mounting and strength of the USB connect, which is readily remedied by using a USB extension. The limited zoom is to be expected in such a small device. Overall, I am completely satisfied with the device, its user-friendly simplicity and the rather impressive quality of the videos it produces. Great price for another hi-tech toy! ...and I like to play!"
5,Amazing video camera!,"This camera is so easy to use that my 7-year old plays with it (now, most of the shots are somewhat less than useful, but he has fun). The only limitation is its date/time stamping gets loopy when you change the batteries."
3,Nice product,"I contemplated returning mine because the installed software did not work as described. Sound preceded the video by about 2~4 seconds. Picture in frame was not the same as when viewed on the computer and it cuts off the end of the video. However it does work with Apples Quick Time. So I will keep it and make it work. It is very handy and all I want it for is for when I do not have a better camera with me and want to record some event. The sound from the playback, on the unit, is way to low to be of any use if you want to view the video and hear the sound."
5,best basic camcorder,We needed a camcorder to make short clips of our 2-year old to send to the grandparents over the internet. This is the best camcorder for this task and the quality of the clips are good enough to watch on our hdtv. No tapes or mini dvds to buy. Highly recommended!
1,This Stinks,I got this in the mail after i ordered it and the mailing is on time which was good but i really wanted to put some videos on the internet and the quality on the video was so bad it was not even funny i could hardly even make out my friends in the video i would not reccomend it if you wanted to put your videos on the internet but it is good if you want to just capture some memories when your on the go.
2,FLIP Video - broken USB,"I thought it was great when i first bought it for my wife. I figured it would be great for all the kid's activites that we're always attending; but 2 weeks later my 2yr. old daughter got a hold of it and bent the USB connector. Now I can't use it to connect onto anything. I called and emailed the company, but their response was: ""at this time there are no parts available to repair your problem.""Bottom line, it's not kid friendly so take care of it!"
2,Piece of Junk,"This cam is easy to use and cheap but there are too many other drawbacks. I have a Macbook Pro and the software runs extremely slow. The videos are a pain to edit and the picture and sound quality stinks. I can get way better results using the icam on my laptop. A lousy zoom and double A batteries round out the mess. Even the aluminum foil-like case on the camera is garbage. It was dented and scratched the first day it was used. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more money to get a standard digital camera with the option to take short video clips. Or better yet a digital camcorder so you can more easily edit, burn, and save high quality videos."
1,Never received,"I wish I had received this camera but I did not. Therefore, I can't review it. My review is my disappointment with the the service from this vendor."
4,Almost Perfect!!!,"Small, light, easy to use right out of the package. Excellent quality video and very good sound. It doesn't tell you that you need Microsoft XP in order to upload it to your computer. I don't have XP, and that was a big disappointment. I have to use someone else's computer to edit. My next computer will be an Apple! Have captured wonderful video, and can make a DVD at CVS. Simple buttons, and over all, a very good product. Would definitely reccommend!!!!"
2,I'm Not Happy With It,"I am not happy with this Flip Video. I seems to work properly when videotaping but will not install the program for it when I connect it to my computer. Therefore, I am unable to downloadload the videos to my computer.Also, my computer would not accomodate it without an extension cable."
1,Broke TWICE,"The camera is easy to use and I would give it a great review except it broke once right before the end of the very short warranty period. I could not get any computer to recognize it. I tried three PCs and two laptops. Nada. I sent it in for warranty repair work. they sent it back saying nothing was wrong, enclosing a DVD of the video on the camcorder. A few months later -- and outside the warranty period -- and -- it is no longer working. Same problem as before. This thing is a dud."
1,You get what you pay for.,"DO NOT BUY. I bought this only to make some Halo 3 Machinima and it sucked. I asked a guy at Best Buy(where I bought it) if it has the attachment for the tripod and it didnt. Almost every time I recorded it fell off. And if you recorded something on the cam and deleted it,it took off that time. As i kept deleting I only had 26 mins. left. Not to mention how bad the quality was. And it was also hard to put the videos on YouTube. It wont save to a folder to upload. Bottom line DONT BUY."
1,Beware! This company will go belly up!,"I have had nothing but trouble with my camera, and what's worse, when I sent my camera back, they lost it! I can no longer get hold of them on the phone. I see the house of cards starting to tumble. Caveat Emptor!"
2,A little disappointment,"I was a little disappointed with the Flip camera; True, It is very easy to use and a very clear image, but after you shoot an hour of movie, that is when your odyssey begins, You cannot create a good quality movie disk on your own, to show and see in your DVD or TV. Yes you could go to a specific store so they could create a DVD for you. Incredibly I have been to a few stores and they do not know anything about this camera, and on ""Best Buy"", they informed me that they could do it, but they will charge me $99.00; all I coud do at that moment was laugh.It is really frustrating and if I could I would return it and never bother with it again.If you do not create a DVD from the movie you took, you could never clear the memory and could not shoot another hour later on!What kind of a deal is this???"
4,easy to use,"great little video camera. Can carry it where ever you go, even in a shirt pocket and so very easy to use. Plan to give this as gifts this Christmas. Only wish that the audio was a little better."
1,What a letdown,I thought this would be a great gift and bought 4 of them. Unit worked well until I tried installing the software and it crashed with an error from Macromedia Projector. Tried installing it on a second computer and got the same exact error. I went online for support or updated drivers and found nothing useful on their site. Too bad for Flip - I am taking all of them back.
5,Easy Video,"I purchased my Flip Video in the spring. The picture quality of the video is more than adequate - I trust it to capture and save the actions of our precious grandchildren. Since buying & using my own Flip, I have bought 5 to give as gifts. That surely backs up my rating of 5 stars.The small size & weight of the camera makes it easy to slip into a purse or pocket - keeping it ""on hand"" for those unexpected special moments. My grandchildren love to make their own videos - something I wouldn't allow with a more expensive camera.I have captured many snapshots from the videos I have taken. Too many digital photos have been snapped just before or just after the perfect smile or expression. A favorite is one of my son, his wife and their new baby, just minutes after our grandson was born.The convenience of having built-in software is priceless.The only con I have is not being able to edit out scenes from the middle of a video. I can only delete from the start or end of the clip."
2,Nothing special,"So I saw this reviewed in the newspaper, under handy gadgets for college students. It got a good review, and I thought the design was neat, so I begged my boyfriend to get it for me for my birthday. I excitedly opened up the box and fiddled around with it, only to be disappointed. First off, the camera is very light. Not in a ""Ooo, neat"" way, in a ""this is so cheap and plastic-y"" way. Second, it was much larger than I was expecting. It was referred to as ""pocket sized"" in the review I had read, so I was expecting something the size of an old school ipod. No such luck.This camera is for the extreme amateur. I'll give it credit for being extremely easy to use, but that's about all the good I have to say about it. The video quality is extremely poor (think old webcam), heck, my 5-year-old point and shoot digital camera takes higher quality video.I would only recommend this camera for as a gift for kids who just want to hit the record button and mess around."
1,What lense did they use to make the promo videos?,"I don't know what lense or video camera they used to make the promotional videos but I believe that it was the Flip High Definition which wasn't offered by Amazon at the time that I bought the Flip Ultra.Unlike the fantastic shots of the fireworks in the promotionals,The videos that I'm getting are grainy andany movement (especially of mouths)further than about ten feet is distorted.The picture and sound quality within about eight feet is good.I bought because of the video presentations made in the ads; in my opinion it was a bait and switch."
3,FLIP VIDEO CAMCORDER,"A nice little pocket size camera that takes reasonably good video.It fits comfortably in a shirt or jacket pocket and is easy to use.You should have an extra USB cable with it as the built in connector does not readily fit in either one of my computers.The weight of the camera is hanging on the flip out USB arm !!!!There is NO WAY to directly burn your video to a DVD on your computer. You must take it to a store such as CVS or RITE-AIDE where they will charge you $12.99 for the pleasure + tax.When recording YOU CANNOT PAUSE, so that unless your shooting one long continous 60 minute video you end up with several short files that hopefully won't be there if you have a video made.The upload to the internet for mailing was painfully slow!!!!!It works WELL on the TV with the direct AV cable hookup and showed a surprisingly clear picture.Overall it's a fun little machine if you don't expect to much, and kids would love it.RFShenandoah Valley,VA"
4,Easy & Fun to use,"Cool little device. Easy to use, easy to transfer video to your computer. I would like a little more memory, but for the price you can't complain at all."
1,Does Not Work With Apple!!!,"We are on our 3rd camera from Flip because the camera which seems fantastic does not work with a Mac, even though they will lie and tell you it does. We had footage from Paris that took FOREVER to download because the camera kept electronically detaching from the computer. Fortunately we got the footage but it was very tedious. Flip sent a replacement that also did not work with the Mac and a 3rd replacement that we waited 4 weeks for that would not even start up! They wanted us to give them a credit card # before they sent the 4th. Do we want to try it again??? Not sure. After all this I do wish it worked but my faith is pretty weak. My advise. If you have a Mac don't get it unless you have a lot of time to kill and strong nerves."
4,Cute and Perfect!,"Great little gadget that will get the job done. SUPER easy to use and really handy. Quality of film isn't extra clear, but good enough. Make sure and hold the camera as steady as possible. It has a tendancy to be quite shakey. Overall, exactly what I was looking for!"
4,Flip Video Camera,"We purchased the camera for our son to videotape his cartoons. He has done several projects and is very happy. We have used it to record trips and events, especially for his grandmothers who were unable to attend the events. The camera has done a great job for us. The sound is a little bit tinny but the picture was great. We are very pleased."
4,Impressive!,"I read the comments from previous purchasers and was skeptical at best.But the product is just as they said- easy to operate, needs no special software,and very easy to operate.If I had one fault to list it would be that the zoom could be better.All in all- great product for the price!"
2,"Too hard for technophobes to sort, edit, organize on computer","Extremely easy to use, but that's the problem - my whole family, including kids, takes videos with this and we end up with hundreds of useless videos. Also, it does not ""pause,"" so when you stop recording, then start again, it's another video. I have NO idea how to put them together into one big video. It's like the old-fashioned cameras with film, when you end up with a lot of useless pictures you keep anyway. We have some great moments in many of these videos, but can't figure out how to edit out the bad stuff."
5,Awesome,This little camera does what the big movie cameras do with the greatest of ease. It imports easily into iMovie for editing. The cost is impressive for what you get!
5,EEEEEEEEEEasy!,This is so easy my 60+ parents and my 3 year old nephew can use it. And the quality is good enough that I enjoy it. This is the perfect size to carry in my purse at all times... so I never miss those shots.
4,Great for trips,"I really like my new flip video. I use it when visiting friends homes or on other trips. (We just got back from Cape Cod) I download the videos into the Flip Video Library, then I move the clips into Windows Movie Maker. From there I edit,add music (my only complaint is that I can't use most of the music from the ipod music I saved,I have to rip an old cd and put it into mp3 format)....Then I put in transitions (which are really fun). I burn everything onto a dvd and send it as a gift to the person we visited. My entire edited version is usually about 12 minutes. If I go longer than that, I don't have enough ram memory to handle it. The quality of the picture is good enough to show the dvd on a 56 inch tv. The zoom doesn't show up nearly as clear as the regular shots."
1,Piece of junk,"Got mine and the display wouldn't show any picture. Recorded voice ok, but no picture?Felt like a piece of junk. I expected better for that price."
2,Great then worthless,"Lame Lame Lame.After I read about this in the NYTimes I thought I HAD to have one.Got one, went out and shot some classic footage. The recording is super easy, and the quality looks fine on the devise. However... I can't get it to work on my mini-mac, so tried on my PC. Again, no go. Tried the update and the update just failed, quit with no error msgs. Now my computer doesn't even recognise the device.I read the fabulous reviews on this thing, and I'm totally jealous. I want it to work. ButI read on other message boards that problems are more common than not, so I'm tossing in the towl.It's going back, and my videos are gone. Ugh...crappiest product I've ever bought...even worse than that Ford Cavalier I got when I was a teenager. Trust me, that's really really bad."
2,"Cool Idea, expected more","The Flip is a very cool idea. Camcorder in your pocket! And it's pretty fun when your out with your friends and want to catch some footage of one of them making a fool of themselves. But that is about where the cool factor ends. You cannot take stills, which now causes you to carry two cameras. I also had SEVERAL technical problems with the built-in software. I am still unable to edit on the supposed movie maker it comes with because it didn't automatically install and when I try to manually do so following the directions given in the troubleshooting section, nothing. If this camera were, say, $50-60 bucks it would be worth your money. But you are better off putting your money towards a decent digital camera that takes video."
4,perfect for everyday use,"... everyday like for projects, video sharing or even memorable events that dont need a lot of zooming, this is for you.easy to share and save videos for your collection."
3,Ready to use,"Flip is ok for what we need, it was alittle concern that no software came with the product and we are not high-tech people. we just wanted something easy to use which this is easy to use, wasn't so easy to download to the computer so we could play with the video."
1,J - U - N - K In a little package,"I purchased this to do some videos from off the gas tank of my motorcycle. Any video that you take over 10 minutes is going to be 200mb is size of a simple AVI file. The problem came about that many of the 20 minute video's we took could not be taken off the device. We had to go back out and do a complete re-take of everything we did out-of-town. We tried on XP and Vista and 4 different PC's FOR HOURS to get the video's off the device and could only get a few off it. We tried Windows Explorer and the self contained software, to no avail - Goodbye Flip - Enjoy your trip back. JUNK! I love the way it just dangles out a USB port..."
1,"FLIP, a FLOP","I returned my first FLIP for a malfunction...AMAZON was wonderful...received a replacement with ease, but it also did not work properly. Now returned for a refund. Only good thing was great handling by AMAZON. I loved the FLIP, but the quality is lacking"
2,Flip camcorder-ug!,"I give this Flip camcorder 2 stars--for potential only. The video and sound were pretty good, especially for the size and light weight of the unit. Unfortunately no PC could recognize the device, so no video could be saved or viewed except for on the Flip unit itself. I've contacted Flip and returned it, but they didn't even offer me a free return--I've paid for the return shipping! After about 3 weeks with no contact, I contacted them, and have been told they have received the camcorder, but no fix yet.In short, get a different brand."
5,Terrific From Start to Finish,"From Season 1 to 6, this is a terrific program. There are no real extras other than interviews with cast members and guests about the characters they portray and some reviews of some of the episodes each season.I would recommend 3rd Rock to anyone who likes farciful humor...... once you get to know the characters (particulary Dick), you really feel like they are the relatives you always enjoy from a distance. John Lithgow must have studied John Cleese and Monty Python before this show was put together. They are like twins separated at birth. Mr. Cleese has a guest spot on the show, and you can see the mutual affection.Note: Amazon said they have to ask for reviews of each season when you purchase a television show with multiple seasons. So please excuse the repitition in my review."
4,Funny Stuff,"As with most shows, the last season is weakest. Fortunately the show when out on a high unlike so many show that run until every nickle of advertising and budget are completely used up. I think the cast and writers did a great job of crossing over into great humor, insane performances, and fun entertainment. I have all 6 seasons - great fun - great price."
4,it was good,when you by one you need the rest for the complete series.i like the show before it came out on dvd
3,It was okay except for one thing,"For the most part the order was fine, except that one of the discs was cracked so now I can't use it and I have to get another one."
2,One season too many.,"Unfortunately, in this final season it feels as though the writers were committed to doing the show for one more year despite the fact that they were out of ideas.The end result is a forced imitation of what preceded - five excellent seasons. The talented cast try to squeeze humor from the contrived scripts but the results, mostly, fall flat.A sad end to what had been a great show."
5,Sad to see the show end,"I had never seen the last season of 3rd Rock until it came out on DVD and it made me sad to see it end.I have to say the creators picked a perfect time to end the series.It had runs its course and was no longer fresh and unpredictable, thoughseason 6 is still extremely funny and the ending is great !!A must for 3rd Rock fans !!"
5,Pure Beauty....,"Vittorio Grigolo Has Such A Pure & Beautiful Voice It Simply Takes Your Breath Away! He Has Power, Passion & A Clear Wonderful Voice!! ""TU SEI"", ""BEDSHAPED/Cosi"", ALL IN L:OVE IS FAIR"" & ""QUERIDA"" Are All Beyond Words! He Joins The Wonderful Class Of Singers Such As...Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Alessandro Safina, Russell Watson, IL DIVO, Mario Frangoulis & Alfio Bonanno...I Am Thankful For All The Beauty In Their Voices, It Is So Nice The Have Singers With Wonderful Voices Again!!!! If You Enjoy Any Of The Performers I Have Listed You Will Enjoy Vittorio"
4,Very nice KVM with integrated cables.,"If you are looking for a nice, low-cost KVM with excellent video quality then this is the one to get. It isn't the cheapest, but I think it is far better than IOgear, Linksys, or Netgear. It's slightly more expensive than those units but you can't beat the video quality. The limitations are obvious in that the unit only supports two CPUs and needs a PS/2 keyboard and mouse.You can however connect this unit to a USB computer through a PS/2 to USB adapter. I used this to connect my laptop over USB. I initially purchased a PS/2 to USB adapter that did not work. I was able to find one model that did work. I recommend the Tripp Lite KVM Converter USB to PS/2 (Model # B015-000) with this KVM."
2,"Great tool, absolutely horrible instructions.",B/w copy of copy type instructions are missing a lot of info. Goes from showing it unassembled for grease installation to assembled with a bearing installed for greasing....no breakdown showing order of assembly....W*F are the instructions for this??????? I hate a good product that has crappy support...right outta the box...
4,Cute- ideal for the nutcracker collector,"I bought this as a present for my stepmother for Christmas. While the mug was smaller than I expected, it was just adorable. She's an avid collector of nutcrackers so this is right up her alley. If you're looking for the perfect gift for a nutcracker collector, I recommend this mug."
5,A tasty indie album with a major-label feel,"After seeing Bunco Kelly at Portland, Oregon's stately Crystal Ballroom, I was skeptical that the band could capture the energy and fun of their live show on CD. I never should have doubted the Bunco boys, because ""How It Came to Be"" is a great listen from start to finish. Independently recorded on a shoestring budget, the album has a polish and professionalism worthy of a big studio release. I've been spinning this disc at work, and several of my co-workers (many of whom are definitely NOT country music fans) have been won over by it. Particular favorites are ""Work is the Curse,"" (a wry little ditty about the plight of functional alcoholics) and the solid Johnny Cash cover, ""Folsom Prison Blues."" It is unfair, however, to highlight any one song on an album that has so many tight, catchy tunes. If you pick up ""How It Came to Be,"" you won't need to use the skip button on your CD player."
4,Pleasantly unique!,"Although not typically a fan of country styles of music I found this album to be a great departure from the typical. Its definitely a foot tapper - Put this disc in the car, turn up the volume, and you'll be 100 miles down the road before you know it."
4,In addition to my short review of 15 July 1998: What sequel?,"Due to the few lines I wrote in July 1998, a lot of readers of 'The Ordeal' have contacted me.I mention that I couldn't wait to go buy the book about what happened afterwards, and a lot of readers have had a hard time finding the sequel.I read it in danish (titled something like: Nr porten bnes), but apparently - and unfortunately - it has not been translated into english. Here's what the french publisher answered when I asked them:Dear Ms. Thomsen. I am sorry to have to tell you that ""Quand la porte s'ouvre"" has not yet been translated. It is however available in French on our website in hardcover and paperback. Beatrice Saubin's other book, ""l'Épreuve"", is available from Arcade publishing in paperback and hardcover under the title ""The Ordeal"".-----Put pressure on the publisher - as did I. The name of the publisher is 'Octolivres', and their email address is questions@octolivres.comOver and outSusanne"
4,A fortune you will follow.,"I liked the book very much. Béatrices description of her travel through the Kyberpass, made you want to go the same way. I have thought about it many times and especially now, when it is in focus for the whole world. Now perhaps it is too late.I have started to read the book again and I long to know how Bétrice life is today."
4,GOOD STORY,i AM OVER 1/2 WAY THROUGH THIS BOOK AND IT SURE IS A GOOD STORY. hAVING SOME TROUBLE PUTTING IT DOWN. IT IS WORTH THE READ.
3,Good content - [crummy] graphics,"In my opinion, Andre Cliche's Ultralight Aircraft Shopper's Guide is a great reference book that's unfortunately marred by graphics that are so poor it's difficult to tell if I'm looking at an airplane or a kotex. This book appears truly ""homebuilt"" and comes complete with non-waterproof inkjet printed text that I joylessly watched run. I was greatly disappointed,and more than slightly annoyed, to have paid a premium price for a book produced by what appears to be an old 150-dpi inkjet printer. Great concept; excellent content; bad publishing."
5,heartwarming book,"I loved reading this book when I was 12 and did not put it down until I was finished with it. I repurchased it for my niece who is 12. It's sweet, funny and heart touching."
2,Good but expensive,"I liked it, its a very good Bukowsky type of story, however its juts like 5 pages long, and its way to expensive, and if u add postage, wow i payed way too much for 1 story! i wish i would have seen it at a library i would have just read it there in 5 minutes...."
3,Interesting yet flaw book,This is a book that has truth and error for it builds on time-setting of last day events. The author attempts to make a case to resurrect prophetic timed dates that have been historically fulfilled yet scriptures reveals that not once is there is ever an duplication of any single prophetic timed fulfilled by either day to year or vice versus.
3,WHAT HAPPENED,"This cd is a good one, but i want the real strung out. It like sounds that they have been listening to some NFG,Saves the Day,Midtown, stuff. WHY,WHY are all of my favorite bands going soft. Somebody please tell me. I know that all of strung out real fans from back in the day hate this stuff. I'm embarrest to wear my strung out shirt out on the streets cause i feel like a poser now. I love strung out with all my heart but come on guys please put out some songs that are for you true fans that have made you guys big in the first place. You didn't become big from playing Pop-Punk, and same geos for Face to Face, Good Riddance, Millencolin to name a few. Just had to get that of my chest, thanks. This is still a great cd, better than a lot of bands out their today. Still get it if your a true punk rocker and not a poser."
2,What happened??,"I give this album 2 stars just because its Strung Out. I can't say I like the change. With ""Element..."" I knew they had changed but the music and writing were still excellent, but on this album it just lacks so much of what I'm used to hearing from them. The music is good enough to listen too, but the writing is just plain. From listening to each other album, the lyrics on most songs make you say whoa sh**. Then i hear songs like ""Contender"" and ""The Kids"" and just want to listen to someone else. ""Satellite"" is about the only good song on the entire album. I hope they do better next time. I will be anticipating the next release with caution of what it contains."
5,Amazing New Strung Out CD,"This is one of the best Strung Out CDs. The music style is a bit different than in their previous discs, but I like it. I definately reccomend buying it. Strung Out has amazing sound and lyrics. If you haven't yet heard them and you like punk music, then get this CD."
1,Strung Out at their worst,having heard strung out's previous releases i was excited when i bought their new CD until I heard it. It is the worst CD they have put out and has only a couple good tracks. Stupid songs like contender really bring this album down. If you want a good strung out release get Suburban Wasteland Teenage Blues or Twisted BY Design
3,OK,"This cd is a good one, but i want the real strung out. It like sounds that they have been listening to some NFG,Saves the Day,Midtown, stuff. WHY,WHY are all of my favorite bands going soft. Somebody please tell me. I know that all of strung out real fans from back in the day hate this stuff. I'm embarrest to wear my strung out shirt out on the streets cause i feel like a poser now. I love strung out with all my heart but come on guys please put out some songs that are for you true fans that have made you guys big in the first place. You didn't become big from playing Pop-Punk, and same geos for Face to Face, Good Riddance, Millencolin to name a few. Just had to get that of my chest, thanks."
4,awesome that they were so understanding...,"I recieved a package but stencils, but they immediately sent out a new set it was amazing"
3,Does the job,"Does the job. Only downfall is that it's difficult to clean b/c of the many groves. Would have to clean with water to clean it well, would rather just vacum it!"
4,Music Games for few players,"This book was not what I expected, but it still has many uses. I am a music teacher and was hoping for large-group games I could use with my K-3 classes. This book is fully reproducible and has some good ideas, but most games are more of the board-game type and can only use a couple players"
1,Can't recommend ~,I have tried on several occasions (thinking I just needed a fresh prospectivve)to make this book work for the classroom. Don't spend your money. You willnot be happy. I bought about 2 yrs ago and paid top price for it.Wouldn't mind if I could have discovered something to use from it.Thought I'd pass this on.
3,"Good concept, but flawed execution","I first found out about this book by way of hearing that the movie options on it were recently bought, and it seemed like an interesting concept for a stylish, ultra-violent action thriller type of book. It wasn't all that bad (I'd actually give it maybe 3.5), but the writing is amateurish and the character development is quite weak, which often left me wondering what motivated characters to do what they do. There are a number of places in the book that issues you'd think would be somewhat important (like say, why the main characters even stick around in their hellhole of a school) are given short shrift. By the same token, the aftermath is unsatisfactorily explained and sends a rather contrived version of the message ""Violence always turns out badly, kids."""
1,I can't get over how badly written this book is,"Let me begin by saying: Buy any other book. ANY.I have bought and read this book on the basis of the semi good rating and a description which is worthy of a Hard-boiled crime novel. I was dissapointed on every level and I can't imagine only 15 people read this book.Years after I still note this book at the top of the ""worst books I ever read"" list.If it wasn't a faux-pas, I would already have burned this book. Or if I was living in a house where I actually had a BBQ pit or something where I could burn it. At this point, I'm even considering marking the book with a post-it that says ""Toilet paper for EMERGENCY use only."".The bottom point is, the book is as much a waste of money, as it is of time, intelligence and space.Do not buy."
4,A fantastic strategy guide for building Republican power,"This is a book that all Republicans should own. This book is a great strategy guide for building up the republican majority and power in the U.S. and makes a very good case as to why the lives of countless Americans and people around the world are at stake. It is concise, pithy, no-nonsense and hard hitting. Hugh Hewitt gives some practical ideas that the regular person can do to influence the makeup of the U.S. government. You can make a difference and this book will teach you to do just that."
4,A primer for Republicans and 9/11 Democrats,"Great analysis of the American electorate:Three parties comprise each major party:--The party of faith and the party of race--The party of wealth and the party of government--The party of national security and the party of licenseGreat advice:--Don't push abortion, guns, or the environment when Republicans will win on security.Great talking points:--My favorite is ""John Kerry has opposed researching, developing, and deploying the missile defense system that will protect us against the missiles that North Korea researched, developed, and deployed under the terms of the agreement that Bill Clinton negotiated with it in 1994.""And lots more in this lively, readable, and important book."
1,More fascist voodoo incantations to chant around the bonfire,"A shamefully myopic view of the political process, as envisioned by one of today's foremost right-wing-media drum beaters. Hewitt's broadly academic fear-mongering and religio-political fundamentalism offers some of the most potent conservative propaganda available in print. At best, Hewitt provides a compelling case for do-or-die electioneering, and strong points on how liberalism has failed to keep pace with society's intellectual energy -- if you can get past acres of gratutious name-calling and unilateral hypotheses. At worst, Hewitt fails to offer more than a rote conservative message on how affecting the transfer of wealth to the most powerful in society, in the name of personal security, and holding a lopsided view of values and morality (e.g., greed and violence are good, sex and aiding society's most vulnerable are bad), will benefit all."
2,boring read,Not much new here. You would be hardpressed to get any benefit from this book. It doesn't grab the atttention of the reader.
1,way to push the hate,"An excellent analysis of the xenophobia and hatred that the modern day GOP uses to scare regular people into supporting their agenda. People, they don't care about you. They scare you so you'll ignore them when they pander to big corporations. However, I'm glad I read this book (I checked it out of the library so I didn't have to give my money to this particular hatemonger), because I know what sort of filth they're pushing at people."
1,Bizarre mess of a book,"This book is full of the usual Republican party line content (that is pretty much the same, no matter what right-wing radio host authors it). What marks this book as different, though, are the bizarre assertions Hewitt makes about the Democrats being incapable of managing things during war time. Considering that 4-term Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt guided the the U.S. successfully through World War II, it made me wonder what ""fit to govern"" really means."
1,Just what this country needs... totalitarianism,"I have to admit, I have only skimmed this book at the bookstore and what I saw made me sick. The premise of the book seems to be that the country would be better off if the country were ruled by one party, namely the Republicans. This has NEVER worked for any other country, as it inevitably leads to corruption and totalitarianism. Do I need to site some examples?-- Any communist country; pick one.-- Any 3rd world country overthrown by a coup; again, pick one.-- Facist parties taking over Germany, Spain and Italy during the 1930's.-- Mexico. Even though its not exactly a one party government, its close enough. The Revolutionary party has dominated for most of the 20th century and because of this, the current president can't get anything done. The latest problem is that Mexico has a huge off shore oil field, which could mean lots of money for their economy. However, the main party refuses to ask for outside help in developing off shore technology."
1,Propaganda,"Hewitt's book is the same sort of rehashed right-wing lies and attmeps to corner the market on faith that we've seen before. He acts as if the war on Iraq has made us more more secure, not less, and he assumes that God is an American."
1,Us and Them approach is destructive,"Do you remember right after 9/11 how we were one? How many democrats supported Bush when he was focused? What has happened since then is that Bush and many others have turned us into an ""Us and Them"" society once again. WE are chasing our own tail by using this type of approach. We have chosen to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world (them), and as a country we are becoming increasingly divided. This author is chosing to keep the fear - hate - attack - fear - hate - attack cycle going. When are we going to stop and realize that it is getting us nowhere?"
1,"Unintentionally funny, this book is revealing nasty secrets...about the author!","If anything, this book shows the rotten mindset of the author: A dumbed-down, undifferentiated, painfully distorted and openly fanatic worldview disguised as rational discourse."
1,more paranoia from the fearful,"The principle behind this book is that Republicans save lives by being stronger on national security. what it conveniently fails to mention, is that more Americans have died on the GOP clock than on any of the Democratic presidents' in the last 20 years.Somehow inherent this thinking is the idea that being a nation 'at war' is good for national security. The notion that our combativeness has increased the dangers to our nation is not acceptable.Unfortunately, it's just more of the same old paranoid ranting by a grumpy old man who wishes for the return of Mayberry.Oh dear."
5,Solid commonsense for saving democracy,"First an aside: why do people who have obviously not read this book post reviews about it?Hewitt is a Republican, proud of it and believes that Democrats should be kept as far from power as possible. He is obviously entitled to his own opinion.He does deliver a powerful indictment against the contemporary Democratic Party leadership, holds forth at length about the historical willingness of Democrats to steal elections and urges motivated voters of his persuasion to get involved and tells how they can do it.This is clearly a 2004 campaign tome. But it does not slip into irrelevance merely because - as Hewitt predicted - Kerry would lose, before he was nominated.The book has value to anyone who thinks Democrats must be kept from higher office. It is, in a way, a course on political activism.Jerry"
2,Not Recommended,"Hugh's book is a disappointment. It seems like a rush job thrown together to peddle during the election. Not much scholarship was done either. For example, he asserts that when Gore tried to block overseas military ballots from being counted, not a single democrat raised their voice in opposition; he must not have done a lexis/nexis search because Gore supporter Zell Miller was very vocal in opposing the effort to block military votes. Further, very little was done to cite specific situations of democrat party vote (...). The way Hugh segments the parties into pyramids and his description of the interplay between segments was useful -- but did not merit a hardcover book purchase. Various Bush speeches re: 9/11 have been attached at the back for reference (perhaps to boost the page count?). I like Hugh and I love his radio show, but Hugh has a fairly cerebral audience, and this book was more appropriate for Sean Hannity groupies."
2,"""Me Too! Me Too!!!""","If you're a Christian religious nutter with glazed-over eyes, you will salivate at this quick-for-cash ""Me Too!"" effort, but if you want something really over-the-top and dysfunctional, read Michael ""Savage"" Weiner.Hewitt is a rare breed in the echo chamber of extreme right-wing talk radio, in the sense that he can actually talk and chew gum at the same time. IOW, it's readable."
1,Desparation play by the right?,"Latest polls show it's NOT close: Kerry's going to win in a landslide.And besides, the folks who cheated last time, as is well known, are the folks on the right.They're attempting to disenfranchising legit voters in Florida (and according to some reports, Ohio now).Hewitt fails miserably in his attempt to target this to ""people of faith.""I'm sure he doesn't mean people who've read the Beatitudes; because care for the poor, the imprisoned, social justice and making peace are not priorities with the Bush junta- the moral sewer of Abu Ghraib, Haliburton, Enron, the treasonous outing of Valeri Plame are items that Hewitt just can't address with a straight face to ""people of faith."""
1,He's absolutely right,"I think the first sentence of the title of this book is right on target.This time the Democrats need to beat the Republicans decisively, so that they can't get away with cheating in Florida and stealing the election.But that's the only part of the book worth reading."
3,Epic Silence in Small-Town Wisconsin,"Zona Gale's ""Miss Lulu Bett"" was one of the greatest bestsellers of 1920: this was largely due to its unique style. Gale's prose is very terse: she avoids any kind of effusion, yet her disciplined, minimalistic sentences hint at so much, that there is a huge ""weight of the unsaid."" This style is appropriate to her subject matter: the lack of communication and the hypocrisy in a typical small town Midwestern family. Her characters always imply more than they say, and their lack of honesty wreaks havoc. Behind their shallow statements lurk desperation and unfulfilled longing. This novel is powerful in its own terse and reticent way."
3,Worth it for the special effects,"Ok, so the cavemen are relatively clean. And they wear relatively little clothing. And yeah, dinosaurs and humans didn't coexist. But it's a 60's movie and who cares? It's a fun movie just for the special effects.Those are amazing, considering computers weren't even in use then. I'm still floored by their ability to do some of those specials effects and look pretty convincing, given the time period.There aren't any real words in this whole film, so in that you may be disappointed. The action is 60's type so there's really little blood. And I wasn't too happy that the violent tribe was made up of brunettes and the non-violent tribe was made up of blondes. That's really ""hairist.""I'd watch this movie more for the special effects than for any historical value. There's really not much. But there wasn't supposed to be I don't think."
3,one million years BC,Raquel Welch is amazing and just seeing her again is delightful but the story line seems to be edited. There are parts missing in the movie that I remember.
4,One Million Years BC - DVD,"I love these old classics, especially anything with Ms Welch. I received the DVD quickly after ordering it and it was in good condition. I was happy to add this to my collection."
4,The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure,"""One Million Years B.C"" is the ultimate guilty pleasure of a movie. There is not a shred of scientific accuracy to it, but the movie is so fun thanks to Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur FX and Raquel Welch in a fur bikini that you don't care."
3,ok,this movie was not too bad for an old b rated caveman movie if you liked caveman or quest for fire you may like this movie
3,"the mother of all crude caveman/monster flicks, but that is some babe","I saw this when it came out, and I must say, it didn't age particularly well. Not only is it ludicrous in terms of anachronisms - dinosaurs and men co-exist - but the story is weirdly obtuse: a savage tribe ejects a member, and he finds a beauty from a more civilized tribe, who falls for him. In between, they can't even have fun without a pteradactyl carrying off Raquel. Then there is a huge volcanic eruption and some survive, walking into the mist.But heck, this is vintage camp, and the introduction of Raquel, who never did much thereafter except be famous. I enjoyed seeing it again, for nostalgia's sake, but see no reason whatsoever to watch it yet again, except perhaps with my son."
2,What do you expect from a Raquel Welch film?,"Only devout fans of Raquel Welch might like watching this film. It's typical low-budget Saturday afternoon matinee material that persons with above-average intelligence would find nauseating. Anyone who learned about dinosaurs in school knows that the giant reptiles were all extinct by the start of the Cretaceous Period (about 65 million years ago) which was long before Homo sapiens ever appeared on this planet. The dialogue is nothing but a bunch of weird sounds and grunts; why couldn't the film's producers provide subtitles? If you really like Raquel Welch, watch ""100 Rifles"" or even ""Kansas City Bomber""; those films aren't the greatest, but they're much better than this one."
1,YIKES! FULL SCREEN MADE TO LOOK LIKE WIDESCREEN!,"gee whiz another classic movie chopped up and whats worse its the short version as well!! one million years bc is the better of the caveman movies released in 1967 with special effects master ray harryhausen.great performances by raquel welch and ralph richardson.this is a full screen print and the top and bottom were hacked off and also this is a shorter version with many scenes deleted,i have to give this superb movie a one star not because of the movie but for the company who hacked this version up.the best advice i can give you is STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRINT and wait for a decent complete version with correct aspect ratio hopefully either anchor bay or criterion would pick this up........."
2,One Million Years B.C. the complete version please!,"When ""One Million Years B.C."" was released on dvd I couldn't wait to get a copy! Just think, a Ray Harryhuusen and Raquel Welch interview, commentaries, isolated score, making of documentary, boy was I dreaming! Not only did it not have any of those features, which I could sadly accept, the print they used was the CUT VERSION!!! Why the studio would cut any Harryhausen footage in the first place was ridiculous! The picture quality on the dvd is sharp and colorful but it's a shame because it could have been great. I recently purchsed Fox's special editions of ""Fantastic Voyage"" and Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea"", they are super! I just hope Fox reissues ""One Million Years B.C. with the same bells and whistles and with the COMPLETE version!"
3,So THAT'S what happened to the dinosaurs?,"As a sex film, this cinema just doesn't cut it. The skimpy outfits are great, but that is all you see throughout the film. The sea that they filmed it in was bloody cold, the actresses constantly (and understandably) complaining. But, you have to shoot in any season but summer, so that's that.The film, outside of ms. Welch, is a cacophony of ridiculous history and paleontology. We see homo sapiens(far from the earliest hominids) mixing it up with creatures that could not possibly have been around. I know analyzing this kind of film for accuracy is absurd, but besides the overstretched loincloth on ms. Welch, we are left looking at the hokey sets, phony creatures, and really bad Euro acting. It is bad, but NOT quite bad enough to be funny."
4,Surprisingly Authentic,"The cover of this film screams ""B"" movie, yet this 1960s movie about early humankind is surprisingly authentic in flavor. Admittedly dinosaurs never lived alongside human beings, and the historian in me was a little appalled at times. But the actors and the female lead do an excellent job of using gestures and other wordless interplay to illustrate their emotions and desires. In many ways this film asks more of its audience than your average popcorn flick...and for all its primitiveness, the characters manage to tug at our hearts.The action and the dinosaur models are surprisingly lifelike, too -- so don't pass this one by simply because of its age."
1,"yeah, one star for effort.","Yes, I spend 8 bucks on this effort. Raquel is not as impressive as anybody else and I expected something close to reality which not happened. The target audience are probably kids who will watch anything that moves but in an age of internet movie looks lame and tame. Avoid."
3,not as expected,the plastic is thin and the handle is a little warped. Other mirrors ordered at same time were the same. You get what you pay for I suppose?
3,Different than what I expected,"I remember watching Timmy Turner when I was growing up and loved the show. So I introduced it to my kids. They love Fairly Odd Parents we watch it every day. So when I came across this I just knew I had to have it. My kids & I couldn't wait for it to get here so we could watch. When it did we watched it immediatley. My kids loved it & wacthed it 3 or 4 more times that day. Me, well I was disappointed. I guess I expected better. I expected to see Vicki (the babysitter), A.J. (Timmy's best friend), etc... It focused more on Timmy falling in love with Trixy (vicki's little sister). The fairies was great you couldn't have asked for better actors to play Wanda & Cosmo. My kids loved it and watches it all the time. Myself would watch with them but if I had to get up and fold laundry or cook dinner that it wouldn't break my heart to miss the movie."
4,I Liked It,"The only reason to give this a bad review would be due to its lack of getting down to the juicy Nixon facts. Other than that, it is a marvelous journey into the Nixon administration. For the most part, it is unbiased and I enjoyed it. If you want to get a look at the Nixon administration from a more or less politcal standpoint, then go for it. If you would like an Enquirer/novel type ""tell all"" book, then look again. 4/5"
4,Fair and useful,"Helpful. Interesting.Smart, strange man who overcomes dislike of people to run incredibly large country of people. More effective on Vietnam than given credit for. Problem with honesty."
2,Richard Nixon,"Nixon had a dark side. His Checkers speech in 1952, in which he used a dog as a prop, should have alerted Americans to his character. His loss to Kennedy in 1960 left him with an inferiority complex. Nixon hated the Kennedys and would never have been president if JFK had not been assassinated. He was not all bad. He stood up to Khrushchev. He opened up China and ended the Vietnam War even if it took four years. He was loyal to a fault. He denied any knowledge of the burglary at Democratic Headquarters inside the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C. It brought him down. Nixon and Watergate became synonymous. Nixon became the only president to resign as impeachment proceedings were underway. It is ironic that his signature is on the plaque left on the moon by Apollo 11 astronauts. Nixon and Johnson were the worst presidents of the 20th century."
3,not impressed,I purchased this book thinking that since it was being fulfilled by Amazon that although it was used it would be in great condition. I have purchased several books from Amazon and from others that fulfil through it and have never been disappointed until now. Most of the pages have been written on in ink and there was even an index card randomly inserted into one of the pages. I had a higher expectation of this book.
3,Covering 1976 - 1981,"This compilation covers Genival's late 70s period, but is far from definitive. It doesn't have the bite of his earlier work, but is apparently quite funny for Portuguese speakers. I prefer his early 70s music."
4,Canned Heat:Live at Turku Rock Festival,"At the fist time rock band from United States visited big rock festival in Finland.Exiting and very good perfomance,even the showtime was at midnight and the wheater was gold.Great! Captures the magic of the band."
2,No Alan Wilson,"Oops, this was recorded several months AFTER Alan Wilson died. A tragic loss to the blues rock world. Bob Hite ain't no harp player and someone should have slapped it out of his hands. This album is a little rough sounding no doubt to the admitted substance over indulging described in the liner notes. Plenty of energy and enthusiasm in each performance. I liked the drum solo. Boogie on!"
1,Wrong Featured Item,"The Eeyore that is in the main picture is not actually for sale here. I wanted the specific one that was featured for sentimental reasons. I got a different one. When I sent the sellers a message about this, they were nice about it and sent me a return sticker and said that there were a few different Eeyores that could ben sent when a buyer orders this item, but the one that is pictured is not one that is available. I was surprised that the seller could sell an Eeyore to someone that would pay between $20 and $30 for an Eeyore but be indifferent about which one they get."
4,Fun and sweet,"I watched this movie (in French, subtitles) not so much for the story but to catch up on French cinema as practiced these days and get a feeling for contemporary French society, or at least a slice thereof. This is a delightful bedroom farce in the tradition of Moliere, but brought up to date with attractive people of the young professional middle class. All are employed (pharmacists, teachers, etc.), all calm, all well behaved, and all thoroughly bourgeois as they gently get one another in a lot of trouble. Fun and sweet. Also a meditation on the universal tendency for both men and woman to be less than monogamous. A great date movie if there's someone you want to kiss."
5,Really nice set for your Hello Kitty fan!,We have had this set for about 8 months now and it still looks great! There is a small amount of pilling but that's to be expected from this type of material. I do love that the top sheet is fitted at the bottom too; very nice touch!
4,"Great looks, Unbelievably Light, OK comfort","Don't get me wrong, I love these shoes. They are incredibly light and they make me stand out anywhere. However, if I wear them for several hours at a time, then I begin to have some comfort issues. Nothing major, but I become very aware of the arch and I end up wanting to take them off. Overall, I'm very pleased with these shoes despite my minor comfort issues."
4,Pretty good rally game,"I'm surprised nobody has reviewed this heavily discounted rally game for the GBA. I guess it's because rallysport is just not a big thing here stateside. In Europe and Asia it's huge... and even though as an American I have no taste for soccer or cricket, I think rallysport is much more fun to watch (and play on consoles) than doing rounds in Nascar. This obscure title is actually a good rally simulation. You get decent cars and circuits, and the physics model is surprisingly good considering the capabilities of the GBA. If you are into rally games, you shouldn't pass this up."
4,Karnaaj Rocks!,"I like Karnaaj because you have a lot of different cars and tracks to pick from. You can also pick which character you want. It is also very fun because if someone passes you, BOOM! Launch a rocket! And if someone is tailing you, CRASH! You can lay a mine right behind you! The best feature about Karnaaj is that if you beat Easy, go on to MEDIUM, then HARD!"
4,Cute doll,"I didn't purchase this toy for its educational value or durability. I purchased it because it's a pretty doll. And, my daughter loves it. She runs around the house with the camera (which never worked) pretending to take pictures. There are a lot of little pieces (purse, gloves, etc) that can get lost easily. But, that doesn't take away from the fun my daughters fun. This is her favorite."
5,Glad as hell,"Enjoyable movie. I haven't seen it in a long time. Love the theme. If the main character was pissed off at the world situation then, he'd really be beside himself in today's upside, PC B.S. scociety. To illustrate just howcrazy this world is today, check out""Ideocracy"", another sad commentary on today's world."
4,Anything for ratings,"While watching this film I couldn't help but wonder if our current talk radio d.j's had studied this film backwards and forwards. Everything plays out like someone with a crystal ball and seeing where the future of news or rather tabloid news was headed in the seventies. I thought Ms. Dunaway gave a pretty good performance but the whole side story line with Schumacher/Holden was un-necessary-though I thought Beatrice Straight's performance was pretty good. My only problem was the last five minutes when the Network's plan to fix the ratings seemingly came out of nowhere. Still, this is definitely a film work seeing."
1,Disc was Defective,"This DVD did not play all the way through. I didn't play it right away and didn't save the packaging, so I didn't try to return it."
4,Excellent film.,"Wonderfully written and acted film. 3 acting Oscars...to Dunaway, Finch and Beatrice Straight. William Holden, Robert Duvall and Ned Beatty were also excellent, especially Holden. Still pertinent today. Really a sort of fictionalized expose of the TV industry. And the American public and its tastes. In fact especially pertinent in this time of reality tv. Highly recommend ""Network."""
5,Good Movie For Sure,"""I'm mad as hell...and I can't take it anymore."" Those words out of this movie will live on for a long long time.It captures the essence of TV sensationalism gone mad. The movie was before its time, because many of the trends it suggested are present in today's ridiculous shows like ""Fear Factor"" and many of the other absurd reality shows...and of course, the worst of the worst is Jerry Springer...a show that capitalizes on people's tragic lives and unhappiness. Anything for ratings, right??""Network"" has a lot to say and more people need to experience what the movie is really trying to get across."
5,Brilliantly Written and Prophetic,"You have to search far and wide for satire of this quality. Imagine writers for The Onion, The Daily Show, and Mad Men collaborating on a send-up of the news media, with David Fincher directing. Undoubtedly, this film should be studied for ages for its prescient messages and skillful acting. The howling speeches become a little grating in the second half of the film, but their ability to concentrate Paddy Chayefsky's perceptive critiques of modern life redeems them. Not enough has been made of the film's take on the co-opting of the counter-culture - its observation that the media commodifies and thus helps extinguish radicalism. I bet Noam Chomsky got a kick out of this one."
1,message to Warner Bros.,"I can't count the number of great works of art heedlessly junked by the studios with terrible transfers. I don't care about special features. I care about respect for the films, and respect for the buying public. This transfer is a disgrace. Other Warners transfers -- Cabaret, All The President's Men, Deliverance, don't get me started on more -- follow suit with ruinous presentations. Stop buying these titles. Force the studios to respect the fact that none of us have money pouring from our pockets; that we've had enough; that we buyers are the market for these life-lifting works of art; that we demand proper due given these treasures. The studios work for us, not the other way around."
5,Probably one of the best movies ever,"I'm very surprised at how current, 21st century this movie seems when you watch it, but it's just the opposite. The acting is absolutely perfect. Oscar award holders would be ashamed of themselves if they watched the acting in this movie :) Well, unless they played in it and got it :)This movie shows us how TV shapes lives (well, now, maybe it's facebook and twitter, not tv any more :P ), what a great effect it has on people. Anyone who denies this is welcome to watch this movie.Woow, it has been a few months since I watched this movie, but, thinking of it still makes me wanna take a deep breath... In a good way though :)"
2,I'm Mad As Hell And I'm Not Going To Take It any More.,"I wondered if it would hold up and unfortunately, in my opinion, it didn't. It appeared dated and simply silly that there were three networks and that was that.Some decent performances but I was disappointed, hoping for more."
5,Prophetic,"Being born the year this movie was released, 1976, I had only recently heard about it and am sorry I didn't watch it sooner.Growing up in the 80s, my first introduction to television was what Paddy Chayefsky came up with as far-fetched in the mid-70's. The current ""reality TV"" boom in recent years is on a par with the radicals that Faye Dunaway's character wanted to showcase to the country.And the way the network searches for something more outlandish than Howard Beal when his ratings begin to slide was prophetic: Today, the networks compete with each other on a daily basis to outdo the other in outlandishness and who can go completely over the top.A must have for your collection."
4,Network,Pretty good movie. A bit more screaming at eachother than what I like. My husband wanted to seeit...we had seen it years ago
5,Another Chayefsky classic!,"Another great one from the pen of the inimitable Paddy. Comparable to ""The Hospital"" in its dialogue. A true master of the spoken word. Chayefsky actually demands something from his audience. Duval is particulary good - ""intractable and adamantine."" Man oh man, the guy can deliver a line. Uniformly superb with brilliant performances all round. Check out the rightfully aggrieved wife of Holden, Beatrice Straight: I defy anyone to find a performance in the last thirty years that's comparable to her small bit. This is dialogue with the power of a .300 H&H Magnum. A classic pure and simple; in fact, Ruthian."
3,Too damn sad.,"The title says it all. I mean, if you want to be depressed, watch this movie. It has a good story and all and Faye Dunaway is hot, but it doesn't do much for me in the viewing catagory. But, I gave it 3 stars for ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take this anymore."""
1,Got Halfway through it.........,"I really enjoyedBroadcast News, and thought Network would be along the same lines....it was, but as a very second rate cousin. The cinematography was atrocious and dated. The set was dark and gritty. A lot of the side/character actors performed poorly. Nothing particularly insightful or interesting in the storyline, or perhaps the whole concept seemed like a no-brainer to me, which is ok, but simply didn't find the movie entertaining. Tedious and boring, I got halfway through it."
1,Awful,"This is one of the worst movies I have had to sit through. Every idea is hammered out, the acting is terrible, and the movie is much too aware of its own cleverness."
5,I just wanted to offset the bad review,The reviewer who gave this one star was basing this on technical difficulties. This is one of the best movies ever made. It was chillingly ahead of its time in predicting the scourge of corporate media. A post-Watergate classic.
2,"Getting there, but not quite there.","I have gone through 3 KVM switches in the last 5 years. My First, a Linksys, worked somewhat just that it had video degradation and the mouse wouldn't switch over. My second just didn't work. My 3rd a Hawking HKS2AU,I had high hopes for this USB, Audio, PS2 switching machine. At first it appeared to work flawless showing the screens of both PC's. However it soon started flaking out when my mouse started flying across the desktop randomly opening and deleting icons on its random journey through flawed KVMness.In other words the mouse goes haywire after about two or three flips through the PC's.So I must continue my quest to find a working KVM.However, everything else seems to works! and no video degradation. 2 stars!"
2,Not enough new material here to warrant a book,"I am a great fan of Tom Tomorrow's and read the new weekly cartoons religiously. But much of the material here (I'd say about 70 percent) is simply reprinted from his previous compilations. Yes, there are some new pieces, and yes, there is a neat colour section in the middle, but when I shell out good money for a book I don't want to leaf through page after page after page of cartoons that I already have."
4,A great history of Tomorrow-land,"This book is a detailed history of TT and even some pre-Tom work by Dan Perkins (TT's alter-ego...). As with most history-sweeping treatments, you do have to muddle through the years while he was learning the craft.This history ends just before the run-up to the Iraq conflict, so if you are looking for repeats of all the post-Iraq cartoons this is not the book to buy -- Get Hell in a Handbasket. But, Great Big Book handles all of the Clinton years (it was a surprise to recall how hostile TT was to Bill...), as well as the 2000 election and TT's attendance at the political conventions of that summer.I enjoyed this one more than the typical reprint-them-all-format, since TT gave a bit of context and organization to the book as well as a few non-cartoon-based words."
5,A Must for Those Who Care,"""Talking with Children about Loss"" is the first book I would recommend to anyone who cares about grieving children. It is well-written, easy to understand, and easy to learn from and implement. Wish I'd found this book long ago."
4,Jazz Power Trio,"Wadmalaw Island will forever be stuck in my head. So somber, soulful, and honest. Another stand-out track for me is Howard Beach Memiors. Frisell charts some very trippy territory with his loops, and Gibbs and Jackson provide solid grounding, both refined and raw. This band has the sensitivity to map out the most subtle and ethereal of emotional landscapes, and the bottom end to shoot the rapids with skill and guts. Aside from the obligatory nod to Jazz history (which provides some flavor and schoolbook context), this a very positive and fresh direction for Jazz."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"The item arrived with the jigger portion stuck tight to (or fused with) the strainer portions. I have not been able to separate them. I've tried twisting and pulling with no success. And the people who have mentioned that the lid is sharp are not kidding. Trying to remove the jigger piece has left both hands bleeding, quite literally. I wish I had read their reviews before I purchased this--and before I cut my hands. I may eventually figure out how to separate the pieces, but I regret buying this anyway because it's so easy to cut your hands with it."
2,"Shaken, not stirred","This thing leaks like a sieve.Other than THAT, it's perfect!But who cares? You're making martinis, so you are going to smell like booze anyway, right?"
2,Cocktail shaker,"The delivery was quick and the item appeared just like the picture, but when I use it it is impossible to get the lid off so I can pour the drink. Decent price, but poor product."
1,not worth it,The top is stuck. Used it once and that was it. Very disappointed. Looks nice but did not do the job.
1,Buy another,"Well, I guess I should have listened to some of the other reviewers before I bought this shaker. As some have already mentioned it leaks on any drink that requires significant shaking...and if you can't shake the darn thing then it doesn't even fulfill its most basic function and is completely useless. In addition to leaking between the strainer and shot-glass the seal between the strainer and shaker sticks and is kind of a pain to separate without spilling your drink...or cutting yourself as another reviewer did; and I can certainly see how it might happen because I had the fear that I was going to cut myself when I used it. I would recommend buying a different shaker, the design of this one is flawed and I choose to use two cups to mix my drinks over this thing."
1,JUNK,Dont waste your time. This thing is a total piece of junk. Rusted on the bottom first time washed and placed on the shelf. It went straight in the trash.
1,Doesn't seal properly at all,"Unfortunately, I had to return this soon after getting it - it doesn't seal at all and creates a huge mess."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"There isn't much to add here, the shaker was clean, polished, and perfect for my needs. Plus, the price was right. Exactly what I wanted."
5,"SHAKEN, NOT STIRRED","Purchased this shaker for a cocktail party - it was great! Looked nice, easy to use, and helped keep our pre-mixed cocktails that weren't being kept on ice ""nice and cold"". Price was great too!"
3,you get what you pay for,"I was very surprised to see rust on this product after the initial wash. I let me dishes air dry and when I picked this up to put away after it dried there was rust on it. I was shocked, I rewashed it and dried it immediately and put it away. We have not used it to make a martini yet, but my husband like everything about it except the rusting."
1,Old - 2 pieces missing!,"First of all, the product said it was new, and it wasn't. The box was almost torn and the shaker came only with one piece, 2 of the pieces are missing. Only the big one is the one that came.If there is any way of returning it, it would be great. What a dissapointment anyway..."
4,Great for beginners,I bought this as a gift for my husband who is experimenting with mixed drinks. This is a great beginner set and he has been very pleased with how the pieces work. I would eventually like to purchase something sturdier for him- the jigger is not very high in quality. But no rust or anything so I am happy if he is happy.
1,cocktail shaker,it is very misleading it is very cheap once you make your drink it is so hard to take the top off and it looks really cheap I will not tell anyone to purchase it plus it took too long for delivery
1,Lousy Product,"This thing is an example of real junk.As noted by others, the top is exceedingly difficult to remove after shaking up a cocktail. It seems that cold causes the material to contract just enough to create an over tight seal. It's almost impossible to get it off.That's not the only problem. Mine arrived with a liberal quantity of polishing compound still on the surface of the metal. This is a nasty chemical that is used to shine up the surface finish. It's definitely not something that anyone wants to dissolve in their martini.Finally, as advertised, the shaker is made out of stainless steel. So how come mine is rusting?Definitely an item to avoid."
5,High Quality,I bought this well over two years ago and it's still making me my appletinis! A quality shaker and you can't go wrong with stainless steel!
2,Does the Job...,"While it does the job of shaking drinks, has started rusting after the first use... If all you want is something to shake drinks this is perfect. Just know it will start rusting very quickly."
5,Good Quality,"For Starters,I was just as lost as you were when looking for a cocktail shaker. I stumbled across this one and had mixed emotions after reading several of the reviews. Some people say their experience was bad and others good. So far, I have not had a problem with mine. It arrived with nice packaging. I have used it, and it does not leak, it is not rough when opening, and it is pretty looking. I would recommend this shaker, however buy with caution. I do not know if I happened to get lucky, or if some are bad and some good.Another thing I would like to point out about this product, is, the title is very misleading. When I looked at it, I thought it was maybe a set (from what it said), however I wasn't sure. Couldn't find a ""further details"" page anywhere. I think when it says ""set"" it means the lid, the base and the little piece inside the lid.Again, I would recommend this shaker, only because mine was good. I do not know the condition in which yours might arrive. Good luck!"
3,OK shaker,Top sticks hard to open if the top is wet as it is too slippery. Price is ok for what you get. I recommend spending a couple more bucks and getting a better one.
2,Very Simple,"This item isn't the ideal mixer, but its simple enough. If your looking for something that lasts longer try other mixers. Safe shopping."
5,AWESOME,Got here quickly and was perfect. also came in a box i was able to just wrap up for my husband
2,bah - didn't read the reviews,"the shaker's fine, i guess, but--as other people have commented--there isn't a great seal at the top of the shaker (with the little shot-glass piece) and you definitely lose some of your drink if you open it.also, it was tough for me to remove the lid from the base. i end up placing the tiny lip of the lid on a counter and smacking it, to pop the lid off.bottom line - you'll be able to make drinks, but you'll likely get frustrated with this product, which could lead to a bad drunk, not a fun high."
1,Horrible Shaker,you get what you pay . the cover is impossible to take off and leaks. def not worth it. spend the extra cash
2,"It works, but gets kinda messy.","Likes: It works, big capacity, looks nice and shiny.Dislikes: When you pull the top cap off, it dribbles. The 2nd cap on the top is kinda rounded which gets things a lil messy when pouring.So prepare for clean up when using this product."
2,Cheap,Wasn't very impressed with this shaker. Of course I jusitfy that with the fact that it was very inexpensive. I found that the lid doesn't fit quite the way it should which makes it difficult when you are trying to remove it to pour your drink/make more.
2,Sticky & Tricky!,"I liked this thing at first. It mixes drinks well, and keeps the liquid nice and cold (not to mention your hands while shaking it however!), and seemed to have an attractive and simple design.I can also state it's never leaked or rusted as others have mentioned.What HAS happened, is that the cap is *really* hard to get off. This, has led to spillage when it finally does come loose. This is incredibly annoying, and for this reason I would keep looking for a better quality one for my next purchase."
2,Did not hold up well!,"I really loved the style and look of this watch at first, but then the hour markers started falling off! I am NOT hard on my watches, so was disappointed that 4 of the hour markers were floating free inside the watch after less than 3 months of use! Won't buy Invicta again!"
4,my review,"Russo Weaver is a woman who must protect her child and herself from harm from her husband. She is able to find peace and happiness as well as love from total strangers in a little town in Illinois, miles away from her home.She builds her life there, but she finally succumbs to disease.The story in this book may be one that we have heard one too many times, but the way the author writes it and describes the characters and their feelings makes it all worthwhile. She writes with tenderness and makes you feel like you are living Russo's life while she tells of it during her last days. You become familiar with Cookie and Shirley and Sandy and Magda and Yoc and also her son, Trooper. At the end, I felt Troopers tears and I mingled them with my own.I recommend this book to all who love and care."
4,this is good....,"I saw this band, Benzos, open up for Blonde Redhead in New York. They were very impressive. Musically they were advanced compared to the sort of bands that had come out of New York recently. Like bands such as Secret Machines and Inouk, there is a new movement in music that is more progressive. Not so much ""prog rock"" as bringing musicianship back into music. Benzos are making complex and unique statements with All The King's Men"" and ""You're Forever An Hourglass."" Their music is dreamy and thoughtful. ""It's Amiable"" almost sounds like Radiohead. The production on this record is very good. The producer has captured the live sound of the band. Every song is a winner. This music needs to be listened to. It is more subtle than many fashionable bands. We will be looking back at this record at year's end and remembering the great experience. This music has some substance."
4,If you don't mind the lyrics...,"Instrumentally, this album is mindblowing. The melodies, percussion and overall band performance is nearly flawless. The drummer, bassist, and guitarist inparticular are brilliant, they are unbelievably tight and construct amazing edgy atmospheres and expertly craft tense buildup within the songs.On the other hand, the only reason I'm giving this album a 4 and not a 5 is because the singer writes lame, teenage-grade lyrics. I truely feel ashamed to suggest this band to anyone else because the initial reaction that people have had is that this band ""has a terrible singer"". I ask why. And they state that the lyrics are terrible. I nod my head in agreement.Download a few songs, and if you don't care about the lyrics, then, by all means, go and buy it."
3,"Intriguing Title, But A Little Disappointing","I was drawn to purchase this book by a review in the New York Times. This review was very convincing. I am a writing instructor working with non-writers who need to be able to write, whether willingly or not. I thought I might be able to use this book in class or at least mine it for ideas. While this work would be a good model for anyone writing papers for graduate school literature courses, I don't think it lives up to the promise in the title. I did not get a clear sense of her audience either. I felt talked down to, and I'm just a teacher [itallics on that] of writers."
4,Read like a Writer,"My daughter, who loves to write, requested this book. She keeps it beside the computer, and uses it almost every day."
2,Review,"This book is too dense for what it is. She definitely lives up to her last name. It's a nonfiction book written like a fiction book and she's telling me a lot of stuff i already know. Condense it, don't use 7 words when 5 will do. Better yet, don't use 700 words when 5 will do."
4,Francine Prose is a wonderful guide.,"Francine Prose writes so well herself and is an astute observer of others' writing. I enjoyed reading her carefully chosen excerpts from various books and short stories and looking at them through her analytic eyes. Of course, I could quibble about why some exceptional writers are not included (Banville, for example), but one book cannot be all inclusive. This is a good book to read while reading other books."
3,Imperfect and stuff but yeah read it,"An imperfect but useful book on how to read great literature to gleam technique out of it. Prose's thesis in the book is very valid: that to learn to write you must learn from the work of masters. The problem comes in her attempt to teach you to read this way. The book starts well with good examples of words, sentences, paragraphs, and the like, reprinting long sections of literature and pointing out the use of techniques and how to find them, but as the book goes on these passages turn into pages of quoted text and then See! Isn't that great! Still, very much worth it for the aspiring writer."
3,Some good tips between the excerpts,"I majored in English and had my fill of reading from the great masters followed by some lecturing, which is what this book is. Yet I love to read and want to be a writer. So this book should be for me. Right?Sort of. There are lots and lots of excerpts. While some of the discussion was helpful, I ended up skimming most of the book and looking for Prose's main points. I did find quite a few tips that I'm going to keep in mind in my own writing, especially those on gesture and dialogue, and I am going to check out a few short stories and books that Prose mentions that sound intriguing.I checked this one out at the library and I recommend you do the same."
3,Excellent read for bibliophiles who love analyzing prose almost as much as reading it,"Although it wasn't, itself, a page-turner, this book provided many interesting new lenses with which to view our own experiences as literary consumers. Her observations and insights were thought-provoking, and I imagine that my next casual read will now be a bit more in tune with literary techniques employed by the authors. I hope this analysis doesn't sour any future reading experiences by adding an extra critical voice in my head, alerting me to particular tactics employed for specific narrative objectives... Reading as a critic, for me, is far less enjoyable than reading for sheer pleasure--Ignorance can, in fact, often be bliss!"
5,Yoga for the Brain,"What I like most about Francine Prose's book is what she reveals of herself in it. Parts of it read like a memoir. She writes that she translated Proust from French into English in order to slow down and become a more careful reader. She confesses that she doesn't know what Hemingway meant by ""one true sentence."" She dredges up the ""rules,"" often tattooed onto the foreheads of aspiring writers, and opposes each rule with unruly examples of fine writing. I attended school during the speed-reading craze of the 1960s, when children were taught to read fast. I used to measure my reading in inches of books per week. I never completely recovered from that benighted pedagogy. Although not a perfect antidote, this book provides physical therapy, or perhaps yoga, for readers' brains."
4,This belongs on every writer's shelf,"Francine Prose's ""Reading Like a Writer: A Guide for People Who Love Books and for Those Who Want to Wrote Them"" belongs on every writer's bookshelf. After reading it, you'll catch yourself reading in a new, more careful manner. Ms. Prose teaches us to slow down and notice each word choice, the structure of each sentence and paragraph, the way the individual authors choose to show characterization. I highly recommend this book."
5,A Read for Writers,"I go back to this book frequently for not just information, but inspiration. The first chapters are particularly useful for anyone who writes. The work pulls you back to the basic idea of the words. Sure, we all agonize over POV, but Prose lets you see that what truly makes a difference are the words.Another good feature is the book list at the end. I carry it with me when I go to used book stores and the library. When I'm tired of the new stuff, these classics Prose uses as examples inspire me."
4,An excellent treatise exploring the literary arts,"I am not sure that I can add much more to the numerous and glowing reviews already stated here. This book should be in every library of the literary aficionado as well as the serious reader and writer. I found Ms. Prose's thoughts on analyzing wording and construction enlightening and thought provoking; to always ask 'why?' as you are reading. I now utilize her reading philosophy in my daily life: the newspaper, technical abstracts, political and social writings, as well as literature. And I have found that this simple philosophy has actually improved my writing skills by forcing me to always ask myself the questions 'why?': why that word, that sentence, that thought?If you want to improve your reading and/or writing skills - buy this book!"
4,Writer's POV,"I read this for a creative writing course. After reading many ""handbooks"" on writing over the past few years, I can say that this was the first that went beyond nuts and bolts issues of technique to provide a perspective on the writer's point of view itself as subject matter. It made me conscious of my reading process, and has changed how I read. I can see now that I used to read mainly for plot. Events and actions made immediate sense to me. Now I read for the pleasures of character and style as well. Prose does an excellent job of describing an abstract process like reading. Recommended for writers, and those readers who are interested in how writers think."
4,Reads like prose,"Love for literature can easily become an affectation. If a stranger or an acquaintance comes up to you and says something like ""good literature can be appreciated down to every single word..."" you'll probably dismiss the person as a pedantic-snobbish-pompous moron. When Francine Prose does it (with a better choice of words, of course), she makes you believe her and pay attention to her. She writes with such sincerity and candidness that you drop your cynicism and enjoy the ride as she exalts writers you do or don't know/like. Suffice it to say, she's next to E.M. Foster's Aspects of the Novel in my shelf."
1,Horribly boring.,"I was made to read this as part of an AP English Literature and Composition course, and I loathed every minute of reading this book. This is no ""guide."" It is a pointless collection of stories on various writing topics that are never truly tied together to be useful. The stories have basically no impact on the topic at hand. Not to mention that the stories are absolutely uninteresting. Avoid this book unless you are required to read it for a class."
1,Writing Like A Pretentious Bore,"Sorry, but I really hated this pretentious, boring, and useless exercise in academic masturbation. It's all just an excuse for the writer to drone on and on about her favorite books. A lackluster lesson in literary snobbery, this lifeless thesis paper includes iffy interpretations of dry excerpts, unhelpful writing hints, and zero sense of humor or drama. If you don't love the same books, stories, and writers that Francine Prose loves, you're pretty much screwed. As a published writer myself, I often check out writing books for inspiration. This is one of the worst. I prefer something lighter, more engaging and motivational to light a fire under me. I like Ray Bradbury's book, with its infectious boyish enthusiasm, and the terrific book about publishing, ""The Forrest for the Trees"" (the first half is inspiring, but the second half a little depressing.) Either way, skip this yawn-fest."
1,Great concept. Poor execution,"The concept is great. The product did not meet the promise. The presentation style was just too artsy-fartsy, like a bunch of undergraduate girls from the Seven Sisters, sitting around saying ""Look how smart I am.""I couldn't finish the thing. It would be a great book to sleep to."
1,Good book but buy it from the shop - poor reproduction!!!,"This is a an excellent book, but I'm very sorry I bought it online as it is a very cheap photocopy with an extremely thin cover. I didn't think this sort of thing happened anywhere except in Asia. In the past Amazon has been fabulous but not this time."
5,Written Like a Reader.,"I found this work inspiring. The list of books to read, for help in sharpening one's reading abilities, has proved to be useful. It has also made for some new and interesting books added to my 'to be read' list. The clarity of the essay as a whole is simple, making for an easy read."
3,Another similar book,"I saw some of the preview pages and got the impression that there is a lot of talking around the subject without getting to the nuts and bolts. Comparatively, a book that has a lot more meat and does a great job of dissecting the prose of masters (not just fiction), is 'Writing Prose' by Thomas Kane (Writing Prose: Techniques and Purposes.Selections and exercises in 'Writing Prose' get the reader to think extensively and deeply about tone, voice, style, word choice, sentence patterns and a wide variety of other techniques.I was amazed that there could be so much to learn by looking at writing with the eye of a writer - going behind the words to see how the writer at work. Kane shows us the workshops of E B White, Virginia Woolf, Samuel Johnson, Sharon Curtin ... and so many others ."
4,Very helpful book,"I found this book to be very helpful. I am new at creative writing and found Prose to be inspirational and, what's more, practical in her approach to learning the art of fiction. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Good book, but I wanted more...","A good book, it does what it sets out to do for the most part. I would give it 3.5 stars with markdowns for:1. No section on symbolism. This is what I was looking for most and have the hardest time catching. I mean, I caught the billboard in The Great Gatsby, but read right past the green light (what can I say, I'm a boater. I thought it was a buoy.)2. The author continues the literary snobbery that drove me away from reading/literature way back in college. How many times last week did you use the word ""insouciance"" in a sentence?3. The author insulted one of my favorite authors, Elmore Leonard. She called him a ""highly skilled and competent but less than first rate writer."" Made me so mad I went out and got Rum Punch for my next book. I guess this is just more literary snobbery though."
4,Good one to begin,It has a good approach to learn how to read differently... if you want to write your own. It is worth to read it.
5,A Guide for Those Perplexed by Text,"The title and subtitle of Francine Prose's new book describe it exactly as it is. As a long-time reader of her work, I fully expected the kind of reading experience that this beautifully written text epitomizes, and I wasn't disappointed. Prose's delineation of the fine points of paragraph structure and word choice should make it impossible for anyone to ever again read carelessly. Moreover, she shows that reading requires the active engagement of writer and reader. READING LIKE A WRITER is also an eloquent rebuttal to those who think of fiction as an escapist, somehow lesser, endeavor.On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this book a 10."
4,Your own private coffee date with an intelligent writer friend.,"So many manuals posited as books make one wish, upon completion, that one had spent the time writing instead. This, instead, is a book to buy, read slowly, savor, think about, annotate, and buy for your favorite reader/writer friends so you can talk about it with them. Reading Prose is like having a long, thoughtful conversation with an inspiring, creative, and accomplished friend (and not the accomplished friend you kind of hate or envy, but the one you deeply appreciate). The works she studies are a joy to revisit through her eyes if you know them already and a delight to discover if you don't. This is how every child should be taught to read: carefully, reflectively, word by word. I'm glad it wasn't too late for me to learn."
5,Better than chocolate is an awesome reading,"I Love the writing of Jennifer Labrecque. She captivates the reading with sensuality and laughs through the whole story.In better than chocolate; two hot competitors are fitting for a vi-president position. Everything was under control until Eve ending meeting Jack ""The ripper"" at a hotel and everything gets hot as soon as they get into the elevator.Hilarious story, definitely have to read it"
4,really neat but no pluto :c(,"this is a cool set becuase you get to paint it but my daughter insists that the poster than comes with it has one of the planets the wrong color. good thing you get to paint it! she is 8 and love the solar system, we have this all done and hanging abover her bed. its easy to assemble and paints nice but does take at least two coats. we had plenty of paint for it though. very nice but wish pluto was included."
1,not good,This item is too hard for a 8 year old child to paint all the small areas.I would not recommend
5,worth the money,"My daughter (10yrs) had to do a project for school. This was great because it came with everything she needed. She enjoyed painting it and was able to put it together herself, except for tying the strings because they had to be thread into a little opening and tied."
4,Solar System mobile,I used this as a project that my son needed for his 4th grade class. He was able to do it by himself.
3,"Our Son is happy with it, that's all that matters","Our son is happy with the final product but over all the parents are a little disappointed. Package arrived in excellent shape from Amazon but there was a packaging defect that was not detectable until the product packaging it's self was opened. The poster that came with the kit was crumpled and ripped in the box. Ok, a lil tape and some pressing, no big deal. Then we discovered there was not enough GLOW paint to cover all the planets as we would have liked, and the glow paint does not glow. Then, when we went to put the strings on we discovered the string that came with the kit was crimped and hard to work with. We expected some what more of a high end product judging from other reviews and product description but, in the end after all was said and done, we hung it up and our son seems to appreciate it."
4,Awesome,"I bought this solar system for my daughter's 3rd grade science project. It took about 2 hours to set up (I printed and glued the names for each planet, not included). It was quality time spent setting up with her. Enjoyed painting the planets. The only draw back the glow in the dark paint did not work for us. Never the less she got an 'A'!"
4,Perfect for a little one.,"Okay, it's not to scale, if anyone has an issue with that, use your head. The paints are wonderful and vibrant, there are plenty of supplies, and it was pretty easy to put together. My 3 1/2 yo niece had a wonderful time painting this Christmas morning, and now she sleeps with it every night. The glow in the dark paint is as good as I expected (not very), so my brother in law went and got some industrial stuff from Homedepot, problem solved. This is great for kids. If you want something that's to scale,acquire some space, because a 1000 yard model of our solar system uses a sun the size of a bowling ball, in other words its impossible to do with a mobile."
4,Good product,"This is a nice model. My daughter, 10, wanted it for her birthday and is pleased with it. I like that you can put it together yourself. She is looking forward to building it."
4,"This would be a ""love it"" but the glow paint is hard to use and there is not enough of it.",The planets hang nicely and it was easy to assemble. My daughter loves seeing the glow in the dark paint when she turns off her lights. The paint was hard to use because it was thick and there was not enough for my daughter's taste - she would like to cover them all!
1,Intruders,The Mini series was good but had to return it for 2 reasons. One the discription at Amazon didn't say it was in Spanish (was told to play Engles) and second and most important selection came frome Italy? and was not able to play in American DVD players (amazon did not mention that either :) ))
4,It's on DVD now!!,"Bud hopkins is really to be thanked for bringing this info. to bear. Anyway, go to ufodvd.com and get the free 2 week trial and then type in ""Intruders"" and you'll see that this is the same one with Richard Crenna!!"
5,pleased,"Yerba matte is great tea, tasty and full of energy. The gourd and bombilla are fun to use. Plus it's sustainably produced!"
5,Very good Yerba,"Gourd is very good. It is smaller then I had before, but it is good, because I add warm more water more often. I clean it every day and nothing bad happens."
3,Curing the gourd,"When I bought my gourd (not this particular one though) it had instructions for curing it. I don't recall exact measurements, but it did include soaking with roughly a few tablespoons of wood (only wood) ashes and water overnight.No mold ever, so perhaps that's the trick? Though they should have supplied those instructions with the gourd.I do love the flavor of this brand of Yerba Mate. Rating 3 because I couldn't post without rating."
5,The Killer Still Wants Her Dead,This is another cool book. This time Jenny is so terrorized. She thinks she killed Mr. Hagen. She starts having nightmares of him. She even thinks she sees him. This is another book you can't put down. You should buy this book. you won't regret it. In this book Mr. Hagen comes back and tries to kill Jenny. Is he? I reccommend this book to everyone. It's really good.
4,it was a fun book,"This was a very...... fun book. i dont think this book was as good as the first one, but it wasnt terrible. It was fun, exciting, and sometimes scary. I think it was a good book to read when i couldnt find anything to do on a rainy day in the summer. i would recomend this book to any loyal R.L.Stine fan. :P"
2,Sequels Suck -Jamie Kennedy : Scream 2,"When I first saw Baby-Sitter II in the shop, I couldn't wait to read it, but now I'm sorry I did. The story got very long, boring & tirsome. I didn't know who the killer was until the end, but still, this book is crap. 1 & 3 are the best, 4 is even worse !!!"
4,Gutsy GO FOR THE ACTION,"Trashy action classic directed by Patrick G. Donahue. Starring Cameron Mitchell, Jean Glaude, Jeff Risk, Jerry Johnson, Bill Cambra, Francisco Ramirez, Marc Sabin, Gary Fung and Alan Marcus.An elite ex-Viet Nam ""Kill Squad"" are re-assembled to help the squad leader bring a group of murderers to justice. Each is a master in the martial arts and uses his skills with frightening effect. The bloody climax is stunning."
2,good for about a month digs into feet really badly,"I bought a pair of these for me and my girlfriend, do yourself a favor and Buy the Reidell R3's instead you will be much happier in the long run."
4,"If you want to learn more about your bible, this is the book","If you want to learn more about your bible, this is the book. It's hard to find a good study reference to your bible that is not politically based. This book tries to be objective, but also keeps the faith. It achieves a nice balance in both regards. It is truthful and honest, and insightful, yet at the same time, attempts to build the faith. A good study aid to the bible I strongly recommend."
2,Disappointed in delivery,"I have ordered from Amazon many times, and did not have a problem.Unfortunately, this time I did. I ordered 7 copies of a book and neededthem within 10 days for my class members. Six were sent in 4 differentshipments. I cancelled the last book as it wouldn't be delivereduntil May. The original order was placed March 25th. I will continueto order one book, but not more than that. The order by the way,was for all new books."
4,Fun Book,"I had fun with this book. It is not too abstruse or full of technical information. Gardner provides a nice, down-to-earth blend of science and philosophy of science, which is very interesting even to the professional. He has a very playful writing style. I like that he gives citations for further reading."
1,Sizes are not accurate,"I placed an order for a shag rug, however the sizes on the amazon site are not consistent with the company's sizes. I received my rug in the mail disappointed because it was a lot smaller than what i had ordered."
1,Studio locks up while creating files,"While the program works quite well as a digitizer, editor, adding transitions, sounds, etc., trying to get your work out of the program is another matter. It nearly always crashes/locks up while trying to create files with any major resolution such as VHS, mpeg2, broadband .wmv (Windows Media), or .rm (Real Video). While sometimes the output files are readable and somewhat usable, they usually aren't, thereby wasting much of your time. I've wasted probably 50 hours at various times and projects, trying to get my work out. When Studio does successfully output files at lower resolutions, (i.e. dial up wmv formats for posting to a website), it does OK."
1,Studio 8 is a disaster!,"Stay away from Studio 8! Its a terrible product! I ""run"" it on an XP PC, 2.4 ghz processor, 1 gb ram. It constantly freezes. When rendering, when it completes, it will include only the last 2 or 3 minutes of the video. Don't even consider this terrible product! View other users experiences"
1,DO NOT BUY Studio 8 or 9,"...unless you want hours of frustration. Worst software purchase decision ever made. Incredibly unstable and buggy. Won't install due to ""error reading license information"" bug which require you to download from their website all sorts of register keys, patches and updates. Also, don't expect any product support, Pinnacle only supports users via email which adds another whole level of frustration. See CNET ratings (I wish I did). Over 70% gave it a thumbs down. Switched to Sony Screenblast Movie 3.0 and it has work fine so far."
1,It just doesn't work,"After many, many hours I have given up on Studio. It just does not work.* Does not recognize/capture from their new acquisition -- Dazzle -- even after downloading all patches, etc.* Hangs when trying to render to DVD/MPEG2 -- again after reinstall, patches, Direct X upgrade, etc.I work in IT professional so trust me when I say this is VERY buggy software. Try something else."
1,They could not of tested this product,This product has many annoying bugs. The most annoying is it has a tendency to resposition the window so that the menu bar is off screen. When this happens there is no convenient way to get the window into a position where you can use the application. It also has a tendancy to freeze. I have a very high end machine with a Gig of RAM. It can not be running out of resources. There is no excuse for a product being release with this many defects.
1,Look elsware,"I am horrible dissapointed with the progression of the studio line. I was a huge fan of the studio product in the past, but now i will look elswhere. I have a brand new top of the line computer and this program still can lock up or crah after rendering for 12 plus hours, this is untolerable and unnacceptable. Hopefully studio nine will be tenfold better or definatly look for another company."
1,Try something else.,"This program is a waste of money. It takes 12 hours to render and burn a DVD (when everything works). If you add transitions or effects (like rolling titles)you are begging for a lock up. Tech support is non existent. Go on pinnacle's web site forum and read all of the complaints about this software before you waste your money. I wish I did.You also need a huge hard drive to edit video. 2 hours of video will need about 20 GB of hard drive. If you dont have an extra 25 GB of drive, dont even think about using this.I have a 200Gb hard drive with 512 RAM and a 2.4 P4 processor."
1,Studio 8.0 is GARBAGE!,"I owned Studio 7.0 and loved it. However, I mistakenly thought 8.0 would be a good choice to edit and burn video using my new DVD burner. I could not have been more wrong! As of January 2003, only a beta version 8.5.5 works according to their tech rep. I tried the beta version, and it repeatedly crashed on my computer. Stay away from Studio 8.0!"
1,Absolutely Useless,"I bought Studio 8 about 3 months ago. In that time it has been one headache after another. This product does not work as described. The technical support is clueless and each upgrade only causes more problems while not really fixing the existing problems. If it worked the way it was advertised it would be a great piece of software. However, if you even get it to work at all you are lucky. If you work to get around one problem you will only encounter another down the line. Even during editing the program will frequently just lock. I do not know how they are getting away with selling this. They should be forced to give everyone refunds. This is truly the most flawed and buggy piece of software I have ever witnessed."
2,OMG,"Everything in this program worked fine, until it stopped playing two movie that i had created. The audio would work but the video wouldnt. Also i can not get it to format to MPEG. It works on it but gets stuck on a clip about halfway through. It said ""rendering"" so maybe it was still working but i left it on over night and it still didnt finish. If that would work and the program wouldnt loose my videos and shutdown so often it would be ok, but i have found it is extrememly annoying to work with."
1,Avoid This,"User interface is great. Everything else is horrible. It crashes, hangs, burps, and everything else software shouldn't do. I never got it to write a DVD, ever. It will render successfully, and thats when I switch over to my Sony software that was bundled with my DVD, which always works, and burn the DVD with that. Only problem is the DVD menus with the Sony software are very basic.I can't complain too much about this junk, (...) My daughter in college used Imovie, which comes with the operating system on a MacIntosh and produced a really great movie.I plan to uninstall this garbage, and get Vegas+DVD (by Sony), or Adobe Premier, I haven't decided yet."
1,I wonder why this company still can do business,"I, along two other friends have the same experience as it has been reported in other reviews. This software makes your computer useless, UPON INSTALLATION. Please DON NOT INSTALL THIS Software on your computer. Otherwise, you will end up with CD Device not working, Hard Disk failure and SCSII cards failure. I say this out of actual experience."
1,Program is VERY Buggy!!!,"I got Pinnacle Studio 8 free with my Camcorder purchase. This program looks great but doesn't work. Thank goodness I never paid for it because it's the worst program I have ever used in my WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE!! I cannot comprehend why a company would put a product out that doesn't work. It goes against every moral principle I know. I could not compile anything for burning. Spent hours editing DV movies only to have program stall during compilation and burning. I did however get it to burn an 8 minute segment of a VCD. But it did so because I just simply spliced a few segments together and then ripped it. It took me hours to figure this out. Basically, if you add the effects, such as fading and animation, the program will not compile properly. Isn't that the whole point of the software, to be able to burn cd's and DVD's of home movies? Folks, save your money and don't buy this version. It is truly a ripoff."
1,I design software for a living,"....and this is PURE TRASH. This garbage should have never went out the door. Thier support organization is utterly deplorable. I'd FIRE the whole lot, dev team, support team, ect..... and start from scratch. I've also filled a formal complaint with my state better business bureau and encourage others to do the same. There have been users that have had a lot of problems with this app screwing up their OS as well. This is JUST PLAIN WRONG folks!!!!!!!!!"
1,"PLEASE, save your money!","I like making movies. Period. I bought a Digital Camcorder for that purpose. It came with a decent editing program. I had to get all Hollywood and buy this [stuff]. My PC is pretty decent, 2 ghz processor, 30 gig HD, 512 MB RAM, according to the system requirements listed for this product, I'm ahead of the curve. NOPE! Rendering kills me! Can't finish my masterpiece! Spent hours upon hours, tried the customer support, believe me I tried. I paid the ... listing price. I want to make this work...This program is great as far as the features go. Creative sound manipulation, transitions, clip editing, but if you can't get the final product, what good is it. Read these reviews, read them all. Grab a sheet of paper, and tally all reviews with 3 or more stars compared to 2 or less. See what I mean. ...!You are now looking at an iMac convert. They know how to use multimedia for guys like me. I just want to make movies that will entertain my family and friends..."
2,not impressed yet,"Whacked. I bought 8 2 days ago, and I've been up ALL NIGHT as I write this. The ""rendering"" was stuck on the last clip for 3 hours, my task mgr indicated the program was running, so I waited as long as I could, then I flipped out and hit cancel. Now I realize that might have been a mistake, since perhaps everything was fine, it just takes a long time. So then I ""shortened"" the movie, and attempted once more to burn it. I'm about to go home and see if I was successful--please pray to your significant higher beings for me--I only want my vacation tape to include a couple damn overlay graphics, and play on my dvd (I didn't dare add menus, much less sound effects)."
1,Worst Program,"Do not buy this program. Worst I have ever Bought. Even with the updates it still has problems. Now they want you to buy their newer version. HAve been on with tech support for multiple problems and my computer is well above the spec's they say is needed. Even went out and spent $300.00 in upgrades per their suggestion. Had for 4 months and still can not compile a DVD or bring video in. By looking at the reviews, think they did not get the bug's out before marketing. Seems we all paid for R&D for the future version (9) or maybe ver 9 users are paying R&D for the future 10 release when it comes out. Tech support has canned answers, must be on a sheet of paper. Pinnacle should make amends to all Studio 8 users on this...."
1,"Not easy to learn, and runs very slowly","I bought the Pinnacle Studio 8 software for the purpose of copying my library of VHS tapes to DVDs. It took me a while to figure out how to accomplish this, but now I have it running. However the program runs VERY slowly. I am using a 1.8 gHz Pentium4 with 256mb RAM so I expect the computer is powerful enough. But I am finding that it is taking 12 (twelve) hours of computer time to read, render, and write out one 90-minute VHS movie. Am I doing something wrong? Maybe I am, but I can't figure out from the help file what I need to fix or change, so I am kind of stuck. Pinnacle's user support seems to be non-existent. This is not working the way I expected and I am disappointed."
1,Disappointment City,"I had high hopes for this program to do slide show, but I found it to buggy and too slow even with a new system, so its back to searching for an easy to use slide show program."
2,Rviewers... paid off? Lucky? and/or?,"You'd think STABILITY would factor into reviewers' outlook on an application.The features are nice. If it happens to agree with your PC.I lucked out and found it *usually* works ok with one of the PC's in my home. Otherwise, it's a crash-fest. All the features in the world mean nothing if you can't get the movie put together and onto a DVD. And I know all about keeping up to date with firmware, drivers, anti-virus, etc.This program's just very shaky.Not worth the gamble and possibly the subsequent headaches unless you buy with a money-back guarantee."
2,Poor Pinnacle,This program has the basics of something great...but was never finished. It is extremely buggy and slow with an unimpressive final product. Pinnacles technical service is equally unimpressive.It is the only program i ever purchased that i felt compelled to return.
2,It needs upgrade,"I have to download upgrade software from Pinnacle website to make it work correctly. It takes long long long time to load the video sequence, edit a movie, add various transitions. Sometime I was wondering it was crash and no response at all (my notebook is 2,66G and 512M RAM)."
1,"Buggy, output problems to DVD",Nice concept and features - but it doesn't work. Initial release wouldn't compile DVDs reliably. Current release (with patch applied) manages to compile but suffers from video/audio synchronization. Not recommended for burning DVDs. It's amazing to me that something which is so obviously of totally inadequate quality was ever released.
1,What a mess this is,I have never run into an apllication that just will not work before. It won't install properly and it won't uninstall at all. Save your money and find some other application to create your movies. This one is nothing but trouble and a waste of your time and your money. It doesn't work out of the box and it won't work after the long upgrade that you have to download and install.
1,Do not buy!,"I have had some real problems with this software. And the customer service at Pinnacle is terrible! The always tell you the same thing, ""Uninstall and re-install"".When I would burn my finished product onto VCD, deleted scenes or something would blink in and throw my movie off sync. Talk about annoying! I am sure there is software better than this out there. I am going to try Adobe Premier now and I hope I get the results from it that I need.*Mac users praise the computer gods for giving you Imovie!"
1,A Complete Waste of Money,"Horrible program. In one week, I've made one simple vcd. All other attempts have failed. Forget about adding audio to the cd. Never matches, skips audio, or puts in wrong place. I have NEVER purchased such a lousy piece of software. Had my niece try and work with program. She is a web designer for a software company. She couldn't figure it out!!! Believe the reviews, don't believe the Emmys.Their phone support is a complete joke. Waited 90 minutes, gave up.The company should be ashamed."
1,Buggy software,This program worked well two times and then totally locked up and I can't burn any DVD on a powerful 120Gig machine.Do not buy.
1,Clearly it's my fault,"If I were to listen to Pinnacle's tech support, I would believe that I cannot burn a disc of my movies because my computer is inadequate. That's interesting as my computer conforms to all of the specifications listed in their manual. It's not my computer; it's their program. It has never successfully burned a disc, generally crashing as it reaches the end of the ""rendering"" portion of the process. I have uninstalled/reinstalled many times and, after upgrading from Pinnacle's website, the program won't even open."
1,Pinnacle 8 RUINED MY LIFE.,"First of all. Are you wondering if you should buy Pinnacle (8 or 9, the same thing)? Are you looking for a functional or at least friendly editing software? I can give you the answer!STAY THE HELL AWAY FORM THIS TREMENDOUS CRAAAAP!!!!Pinnacle made me cry, and I'm not joking or exagerating. It made me cry, when I lost my 43-min project when I'd just reached half of it... Also when I was doing the final render, and WITHOUT MY PERMISSION it'd just change the audio tracks, turn one song into another, repeat video files I didn't even include (sometimes I was just wating for it to include video files I hadn't even captured!), it goes wacko, crazy, mad, lunatic...it's frustrating. Not to mention all those times where I just layed too much of my trust on it, didn't saved every single thing I did and it'd just crash and end itself.Why oh why, did I EVER thouhgt of buying this? Please listen to me, listen to us all and don't make the same mistake we did. DIE PINNACLE."
1,Save yourself the aggravation - don't buy this!,"Too bad I didn't read all these reviews before I bought this software! I have a brand new Pentium 4, 2.4 ghz processor, 256 MB ram. Bought the software, came home all excited about making a VCD...hours later I finally figured out how to make it capture some video. The program takes forever to open, to the point that I can't tell if it's still loading or if it's frozen and I should reboot. Same problem after clicking the button to start the rastering process. Took me 2 days to create a 10 minute VCD, but at least it worked...that time.Now, I'm trying to create a 5 minute movie of wrestling highlights, and the software acts as if I'm trying to create a 5 hour movie. I've been working with it for 4 days now, and still no go. And now, my other programs have started crashing.What a lovely (ha!!) piece of software! Your money would be well spent on almost ANYTHING else!"
1,Don't buy this program,They should sell a program with less features and is more reliable than having the public work out their bugs for them. How are they able to get away with selling junk?
1,Absolutely disappointing...junk,"I was thrilled with this program...UNTIL...I used it for any length of time. The short review: It Doesn't Work... This is the worse kind of software. Very pretty and stylish interface, loads of features....none of it works. I know my way around a computer. I built my present system with video editing as the main goal. The DVD software that came with my DVD burner has few features...is childishly simplistic...and works. Studio 8 is junk and a waste of time and money. You will grow old fast trying to use this software. It is so bad, and customer service is so ineffective...I will never ever give a Pinnicle product another chance....never ever. Very poor product, not even up to Beta standards."
2,Slow Slow Slow,The program doesn't work well at all and the customer support is completly worthless and rude.
2,Don't count on MP3 support,"I requested a trial version of Studio 8 from Pinnacle. While I like the ease of use of the product, I wanted one key feature which does not seem to be supported--ability to use MP3 files from my music library. I have been conversing with tech support at Pinnacle, and it appears that Pinnacle's claim that it can import MP3's is innacurate. I have been unable to import MP3 files created from either Real Networks RealOne player, or from the plug-in link provided by Windows Media Player (XP). Apparently, they record MP3's with 'non-standard' tags. The techs (2 seperate ones) would not provide me with the name of any programs which could record MP3's that Studio 8 would recognize."
2,DVD authoring is NOT RELIABLE,"Do not think that you can reliably produce video DVD's with this software!! On those rare occasions when your project is successfully rendered, compiled and actually burned to disc, you still do not get what you set up. Studio 8's new DVD authoring software is deeply flawed."
1,Wishful Thinking,"If this software actually performed as designed, it would be a wonderful value. It's very easy to edit video, the tools are intuitive, and the interface is well designed. There's only one problem. It doesn't work. I have struggled with this software for almost a year, and I've tried all of the on-line updates (beta and general release), but each one fails to reliably generate a DVD, VCD, or even a complete MPEG-2 file. And I'm talking about 5-10 minute videos! (I have a Dell 8200 with a 1.7GHz P4/768MB/160GB, running Win2K, so I'm not platform constrained. Adobe Premiere and AfterEffects run flawlessly.)Don't buy this software. I have wasted more time struggling with this software than editing video, and that's a lousy way to pursue a hobby!"
5,Works well,Captured my home video and edited it. It was quick and easy.DVD R/RW compatibility is a different issue.
1,This software really sucks,"Hi there, straight to the point, this software is not worth a penny.....takes so long, I've even upgraded my computer with more memory, and dual processor, and still this program will not budge, spend your money elsewhere....thats where I'm going...."
1,I'd give it a no star....,"While you can ah.....sorta edit....Video capture lags badly. When I say this let me also say that my machine is an Athlon64 3100+ with 512MB DDR 400, ATI 9600 128MB video (How I got the software)250gig 7200 ata 133 drive and it has done nothing but drop frames faster that it gets 'em....Yeah I have went thru all of the settings blah DMA blah defragement blah etc.... so when I transfer to DVD from VHS AND after waiting for the (Choke) render (like 3 hrs)well....jerky video on DVD is what I end up with.....Lets face it, pinnacle is crap...I am just glad that I did not have to purchase the software....Sure would like to know of somthing that actually works...."
4,My sanity is restored--I must be lucky,"UPDATED REVIEW: I went to check on my first project (at 4 am I cancelled the ""rendering"" of a 35 min. dvd burn, as it was stuck on the last scene for 3 hours), and lo and behold, it came out great. Now, I didn't add menus or sound, and only a few graphics. But I did edit various scenes, and I was quite concerned it would get ""stuck"" rendering. The video quality was very, very good, the sound excellent, and quite frankly, I'm pleased with my purchase. I hope not to encounter the problems others have in future projects, but for what it's worth, the software has worked beautifully for me."
2,"Nice interface, but...","PS8 doesn't seem to want to import DivX files, which is a fatal flaw for those of us who download material in the DivX (AVI) format off the Internet.I have had luck with Movie Factory 2 so far, but their technical support is nonexistent as well."
1,Be careful - Studio 8 might not work,"After successfully using versions 6 and 7 of this program, I bought Studio 8 but was severely disappointed. One of the primary features, the title program, will not work. I tried every tip Pinnacle's tech help suggested, but none solved the problem. Pinnacle's response was, in effect, ""it's your fault."" Before you buy the program, make sure you can return it for a refund if not satisfied."
2,"Great Potential, Poor product!","As with others here, it has a great design, and features, but is very very buggy, and overly slow. It often hangs, repeatedly, and gets things wrong; requiring a start over.Their customer support is very poor, and not helpful. Their huge customer forums are possibly helpful, but they must not monitor them, as they are full of bug reports!"
2,Not for long projects,"The most unstable program I use. Works nicely when it doesn't crash. Seems to work fairly well with short projects (say, less than 1/2 hour) then starts falling apart with longer ones."
1,Looks good but VERY unstable,"This product is packed full of features--transitions, effects, titles etc. I wish it worked, but it is VERY unstable. The title editor and the DVD menu editor make the entire program crash whenever I opened them up. The program would also just close sporadically. I paid over $100 for this and Hollywood FX and I can't use either. Customer support doesn't offer much in the way of solutions either--I have contacted them 4 times now and I'm still stuck with a very buggy program. Check out Roxio Movie Creator for a basic,easy video editing program. For a program that offers you more control, Video Explosion is awesome and packed full of features just like Studio 8--plus its very stable."
1,Buyer Beware!,"2 words: Run away!I really regret buying this. In theory, it's a great program... but in reality this program suffers horribly from an extreme amount of bugs. Customer service is equally bad (or should I say non-existant?). This has been my experience and many others. If you don't believe me, check out the forum at Pinnacle. You can see what the latest bugs are (And they're not minor either). Here's the link:http://webboard.pinnaclesys.com/read_forums.asp?WebboardID=1&SectionID;=143&lng;=1&ProductID;=454&SubDocTypesID;=181"
1,Great Potential but Very Flawed,"After using products from ULead, Sonic, Microsoft (MovieMaker 2), and now Pinnacle (Studio 8 with updated patches) I have come to the conclusion that there are no options for affordable and reliable DV editing at this point. Studio 8 is the best in terms of features, but is unpredictably buggy (especially at the rendering and burning stages). I have completed ~10 full DVD projects to date, and have experienced every type of bug: audio drift, rendering freeze, compiling freeze, etc. For very simple projects, you may have a successful final burned DVD 75% of the time. Not good enough.If you have the money and are looking for a reliable product, I would suggest looking at Premiere (although I don't have experience with it). If you have an even higher budget, don't waste your time here - look at Avid DVExpress.As a video amateur, I'm still waiting for a consistently stable program for DV editing and DVD authoring."
1,studio 9 coming in Jan/Feb,Do NOT bother with Studio 8. Even if you have the most advanced system you will und up with totally unusable final projects.Pinnacle has refused to even deal with the fact that 90% of users - including people who from their questions show they are highly advanced with advanced hardware as well -- can not get audio and video synchronized. This is a fatal falw and makes studio 8 worthless!Studio 9 is coming in Jan/Feb. My advice....wait and check amazon reviews for thosw who know what they are talking about.
1,save your money,"I have struggled with this system for a couple of months now. I have reprogramed my hard drive and contacted the support for Pinnacle many times. I cannot believe how much money I have wasted on DVDs that have to be thrown away. You get one issue partially resolved only to have another pop up. If you really want to make DVDs, then buy a DVD recorder and hook it to your TV. This is a waste of time and money."
1,I'd give it negative stars if I could,"Don't buy it. My kids will probably all gratuate from college before I can get a DVD project completed with this software. It is a lemon. It has awesome features, which makes the experience all the more bitter. You think you've created a masterpiece, and then some software bug corrupts your project and makes a DVD unproducable. It'll fail you when you most need it.If Pinnacle ever gets their act together, I'll revise this review. But for now, I'd give it negative stars if I could."
1,Buggy product,"The concept of this product is the same as past pinnacle product pctv. This older product works on my old PC and needs Hours to compile a 15 minutes movie but it works.On my new PC, that is very powerful, i am still trying to use STUDIO 8 version 8.3.18.My first problem: Capturing is in Black and white. I looked on the Internet to find out that lots of users have the same problem. I am now using another product to capture, but rendering and assembling a movie in Studio 8 works only for Mpeg's that are less than 2 minutes. For longer movies the Studio 8 hangs and you have to close it trough Task Manager. Up to now the product almost useless for me, although its concept is very good."
1,STUDIO 8 DOESN'T WORK!,"I'm a Studio 7 user and I like it even when it eventually crashes. I bought Studio 8 because of the new and nice features but I can't create a SVCD or a DVD because after many hours rendering it just stops working! After days of trying everything thinking I did something wrong, I called tech support, which is a long distance call and after a 40 minutes wait they just didn't know how to help me. I just can't use this product at all after so many hours of work creating my project!! I'm gonna have to uninstall this product and look somewhere else. This Studio 8 experience was a waste of time and money..."
1,Pinnacle Studio 8 Is Junk,"Over and over I've worked, studied, upgraded, optimized, tweaked and sworn at Pinnacle Studio 8! No support, lots of crashes, and no finished discs! Not even a rendered image file! Junk program. A coaster. I've had it. Windows Movie Maker runs circles around it! Anyone know the CEO's address? I've got a litte package I'd like to send him/her. A junk program he/she doesn't even offer support for any longer."
1,Wasted money NO SUPPORT,"The program will not recognize my DVD burner, instructions as useless and support is non-existent.I am not a computer neophyte; my only conclusion is that people who find this product works for them have just landed in the correct statistical bucket.Advice; don't waste your time."
3,easy as $&%@ but dumb as #@$%,"ok ok i could go on for days but ill make it snappy so you read it allthis is soooo easy to use. if your worried about not figuring it out dont the buttons do what they say and its really good even on a slower comphowerver rendering SUCKS!!! i have been unable to make a movie beacuse of it jsut freezing and i have a nice computer 1.8 ghz, 512 ram and all but im not sure whyalso the customer support is really pretty good...i sent a letter and the next day i got an email helping fix my problem...to bad i gave up on it for Adobe Premiere 6.5 NICEbut for a cheap beginers program this is packed with features and options and if it doesnt freeze on your comp like it does on mine it gets a 5 plusyou can make menus record to dvd, vcd, svcd, internet files, and vhs...plus lots of others like dv. avi's and lots more!!!good program bad dependibility good customer supportand most importantly goodluck"
2,Works ok but tech support is awfull,"I used this product to sucessfully convert a VHS family video (2 hours) to DVD. It turned out great. However, I have a problem with burning multiple DVD's. Talking to others and looking at the support site found others (though not all) had seen the similiar problems. So when I contacted tech support for help, I was expected some intelligent answers to my queries. Instead all I get is repeated canned answers. And what is more maddening is that the canned answers are coming from real people not a computer. Apparently each class of question has a canned answer that they shoot back at you and the answer generally seems to be ""reload the software"". If everything works ok for you then you'll probably be happy. If you have any problems expect to get very frustrated with the support."
2,Good for awhile,"i have made 6 photo slide show dvds that included music and transitions. Friends love them as gifts. However, once i burn them - that's it. The shows are then gone - either blacked out or just wont open. I just spent 4 hours working on the my lastet snow trip. I went to burn and it said that my movies werent referenced?? Then i restarted my computer only to find that my show will now not open. im in search of a new software!"
2,Don't waste your money!,I must say that when this program works correctly it's great. But that's the problem....it does not always work correctly. Pinnacle Studio 8 is extremely buggy. Sometimes it works...sometimes it doesn't. I have a very powerful computer and it makes no difference. Pinnacle support is worthless. Pinnacle has a huge support forum because the product is so bad. They need the support forum because the support guys don't have a clue and they are continually releasing patches to try to fix the problems. Save your money and don't buy this product.
2,have A LOT better 4 A LOT cheeper,I have not been happy with this product. One good feature is the unique titles. Overall I perfer to use Windows Movie Maker that I downloaded from Microsoft.com for free. With that I purchased Microsoft Plus! Media Edition. I wanted to put some Mp3 files on a movie I made with this and I couldn't find a way to do that. I would not recomend this program to anyone.
1,Do not buy this program!,"This is, quite possibly, the worst piece of software I have ever owned. Not only is it full of bugs, tonight it started DELETING other programs on my hard drive. The other reviews are right on -- it has great potential, but it's not worth the hassle. To quote Monty Python, ""RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!"" from Pinnacle Studio 8 as fast as you can."
1,Buggy and half-baked,"Forgive my poor English from Germany...But listen, listen, listen.Studio 7 was buggy when released to the customers. After a long period of beta-testing by unpaid purchasers worldwide it became a fine video editing application.Same now with Studio 8.It must have been very buggy when released, even containing ""showstoppers"". Now, after betas, update, beta and several releases and bundles (e.g. with TOSHIBA burners) it still isn't what it should be especially for newbies. In parts worse. New bugs added.Buying? - Yes. - One should visit the Pinnacle Studio 8 webboard and see what the users report. When they were able to download an update that works, one may wait until this update became the normal retail version. Then buy, buy, buy, and have fun."
1,Believe the reviews... run away.,"I purchased this software on the advice of a friend. I managed (after about 2 days of suffering through crashes) to put a 5 minute project together. I figured it was just my old P3 1.0GHz computer that was causing the problems so I just saved my video for another day. Then the day came when I got my new P4 2.8GHz HT computer. I dusted off the software and tried again. I could have saved myself hours of frustration by just not doing it, but I couldn't help myself. I did manage to burn on really nice 15 minute project with only a little trouble, but it's been all downhill from there. The technical support just sucks. Now, I'm looking for a new editing program that's going to cause less grief. Do yourself a favor: look somewhere else. Maybe someday, Pinnacle will come up with something worthy of the hype, but it's not today."
1,Believe the bad reviews,"I've never taken the time to write a review, but I couldn't resist sharing my frustration about this product. Pinnacle Studio 8 is by far the worst piece of software I have ever seen or tried (in vain) to use. My new and powerful computer crashed almost every time I even tried to open the program. Capturing video was nearly impossible. I'm embarrassed to have wasted even three days of my life with it. Please be forewarned and don't waste YOUR time or money."
2,Abysmal technical support.,"I love the ease of use of this program. It is full featured and produces amazing results in a huge variety of formats (DVD, SVCD, etc.). However, I originally purchased its predecessor, Studio DV which came with a firewire PCI card which has given me no end of grief, despite upgrading and eventually replacing my system to a much faster one. Their tech support frequently takes over a week to respond to emails (if at all), and seems to be delaying the whole exchange process to a ridiculous degree. They have a telephone option for support which is $14.95 per incident with a 40 minute wait time on hold. If you are daring enough to buy from this company count on NO WARRANTY coverage, as practically that is what I have received so far."
1,Pass on Pinnacle Studio 8!,"Until they work out some very serious problems I suggestyou pass on this product. I have been working with Studio8 since November. It crashes when you least expect it toit hangs up in rendering, and will not even get to burn disc.I have contacted support via phone and email. Neither couldgive help to make this program work. I have downloaded allupgrades and patches etc. Still loaded with bugs and problems.This really looked like a wonderful program, and IT SHOULD BE...BUT it will rob you of your sanity and leave you defeated.PINNACLE PLEASE FIX THE BUGS!!..."
1,Glad it was free...,"I received this software through a Canon rebate and was excited to create some DVDs of family gatherings, new child, etc. Nothing extraordinary here. My computer is less than a year old, has 512RAM but with this software functioned like it was 10 years old. I never did get this software to work how I wanted. Each time I tried to accomplish something, it ran so slow that my patience quickly evaporated and turned to mad frustation. Not only this, but it completely jacked up my machine. Everything seemed to run slow. So last night I backed up all my files, wiped my drive, re-installed XP and all my programs except this...amazingly, my computer works great again. DO NOT INSTALL THIS SOFTWARE!"
1,Weapon of Mass Destruction,"The Weapons of Mass Destruction have migrated to Pinnacle video software. After I installed Pinnacle 8 on my high end Toshiba laptop I had to return the computer because of a hard drive failure. This is not conclusive proof that Pinnacle caused the failure, but read other reviews and you will see there is a good possibility it was.Oh, yes, I did get an opportunity to put in about twelve hours trying to make a video only to lose it all in a crash."
1,HORRIBLE,"I'm very dissapointed...this program is the most unstable and unreliable video editing program I have ever come across. I mean, why not download Windows Movie Maker of Apple iMovie for free? They don't seem to have any problems, not to mention they have more effects than Studio. When I bought this, it seemed like a good idea, until the program wouldn't run for more than three minutes without closing without warning. Thats right...the program just instantly closes at random. I mean, they call it a 'professional moviemaking system'; I'd expect a bit more. And it's not just my computer, thats for sure. I have a Dell Dimension desktop, 2.5 gigahertz, 512MB of RAM, and a 64MB video card. Don't spend money on this...you're sure to regret it."
1,Be Warned: This is a Crippled Version,"Apparently, Pinnacle only sells crippled versions of this product in the US that only support the NTSC standard. If you want to create PAL videos like me, you have to order the full product version in Europe, even if you live in the US - that is the answer I've got from Pinnacle support."
4,why is it bad?,"hi , i recently used this sofware and found it to be very good.yes it does crash but i have never lost my work as it is all there when you start it up again, this is by far the most powerful software i have seen, but you dnt have to be a professional to use it. i reccomend it highly"
1,ANOTHER program that doesn't work...,"Well, let's see... First of all, it doesn't have the white in/ white out transition, which I thought was standard. Second, putting in music and getting it to play with your clips almost never works. I tried making a simple 12 second movie, but after several long hours of frustration, I just gave up. You have to convert video files it doesn't accept with Video Wave (which comes with it, I think), and that takes a very long time. Also, when you actually make your project into a video file, it takes an eternity! And it left almost FOUR MINUTES of soundless blackness on the file before it actually had the movie I made. The only thing left for me to try is getting an Apple computer so I can use Imovie. And if that doesn't work... I seriously think I'll go insane. ALL I WANT IS SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR A CHANGE!"
3,Momentum women's blue dive watch,"This is a comfortable stylish dive watch. The overall appearence is nice but if you are a serious diver I'm not sure this is the watch for you. I use this watch as my everyday work watch. I like the rubber band, making this easy to keep clean. I have a larger wrist and this band has plenty of length- it would probably be too long for a women with smaller wrists. The face is nice but I wish it had larger numbers. It shows the date but not the day of the week. I gave this an overall 3 for the features and cost."
4,Liking this,"I am using this product in conjunction with the SCD diet and have found that it is somewhat helpful with my digestive issues. I have not found this product locally, so am glad to know that Amazon has it and I am able to get it sent right to my door. I will purchase this product again."
1,No help; caused discomfort,"I bought them because they were much more economical than the ones I purchased at the health food store, however, I didn't find this item helped with my digestive issues. Furthermore, I started having severe cramping after taking them. I stopped for a while and started back to make sure that the emzymes were the cause, and sure enough, they started back after I resumed them."
1,"Might work for some, but...",This upset my gut and I discontinued it after a few weeks. I've gone back to my old brand and am much happier.
2,Did Not Work Well for Me,"Have taken many different brands of digestive enzymes (pancreatic emphasis) for several years and decided to try these as the price is more reasonable than many other brands and the formulary got good reviews. However, even though I had nothing but positive expectations, my poor digestive symptoms returned. I then tried doubling up --- still not doing the job. Cannot recommend, as after a week all my negative symptoms which have been held at bay (upset, bloating, gas, irreg., etc.) are returning."
3,cheap - fair.,Cheap but not real effective for me.I bought this and do not think this work well for me.
5,WOW! Really Works!,"OK.......short and simple. My wife and I had embarked on a new diet January 1st. NO SUGAR, NO WHITE FLOUR OR ANY REFINED FOODS, AND NO CANNED GOODS! We made a choice to bake all our own bread and eat large amounts of super foods. This was all good and we saw great results in our energy levels and all around health. The down side was massive amounts of bloating and gas that did not get any better. We read up on this and other enzyme products and came to the conclusion that this would work. It works fantastic!! My wifes bloated belly is gone and we both feel normal. Best of all we know that with the help of this broad spectrum enzyme product we are guaranteed to get the most nutrients from our healthy foods. Thanks Source Naturals!"
3,It does not really work for me.,I have been trying to use this product taking one capsule before my main meals but it does not seem to do anything for me. It maybe working for other people but but I do not notice any difference in helping my digestion.
1,do not like it!,This product did not help me with my digestion. I tried taking for 1-2 weeks but did not see any benefits.
1,GAS!,"Multiple people tried these enzymes and we all had the same outcome. While food digestion may have been more comfortable initially, we all developed gas afterwards. This is due to the lack of a certain enzyme in the mix. UDO makes a much better enzyme mix."
2,may bey works for someone,it might work for someone not in my case ..i have a hard time digesting foods like carbs i get gessii ...so iwould not recomment
5,They actually work!,"I bought them simply because it was suggested for people with digestive issues such as gas and boy did it work...it cut down on the amount of gas tremendously...couldn't believe it! Definitely look into taking a blood food allergy test too because I found out that I was allergic to 4 common foods and when I took them out of my diet, it helped too."
3,They Do The Job,"I take these before every meal to avoid acid reflux conditions. They do work, but not as good as taking papaya tabs after each meal. Put it this way, I have gone through the same size container of papaya tabs twice while still having not emptied the enzymes container."
2,NOT VEGAN,"I wish I had read the reviews first. I was thinking this was vegan. I took it for two days and the gelatin made me sick. Really bummed and disapointed.EDIT: I'm giving two stars, because the company was great about returning the product, thank you for that."
3,Eh,"After the first week I noticed a reduction in gas. After 4 weeks I noticed all my symptoms are back and my body got used to it. I get heartburn and gas more often with no change in diet from before. It may work for some, but not for me."
2,Placebo effect?,"I didn't notice that this helped digestion. I'm on an intermittent fasting diet where I get one large meal a day at night time and thought this would help with improving digestion and making food absorption more optimal. Can't tell if it is working or not. Guess not, since I haven't noticed a bit of difference."
3,Effective for a limited pills,"Maybe it's just my GI system, but on my first Two weeks my Stool color was healthy Brown, and I was able to eat most of the food without any stomach discomfort, but fun only lasted for Two weeks (25-30 Pills) then all my symptoms re-appeared, and the Stool color changed. Like rest of the pills I was taking had no potency, so I stop taking them. Will try the Life Extension product next."
1,Useless.,This product is expensive and didn't work. There was no affect whatsoever. I returned it for my money back.
1,"Damaged, open box delivered via USPS to my mailbox","This is the worst packaging of a mail order delivery I have ever received! The box arrived today smashed in and open, and USPS had wrapped the box in plastic with a sticker saying the box was received damaged and without contents!!! I can't believe USPS would leave this in my mailbox. I received another order from Amazon via USPS yesterday that was left at my front door. That order was from another seller, and it was in good shape. I've sent pictures of the open and damaged box to Amazon. I'm awaiting a response and refund."
4,Don't need all that acid reflux meds anymore,"This product does more than just protein. It works on everything. One warning, it can act as a powerful laxative so don't start off taking more than 1 at a time. My mother had to stop taking it just for that reason, she's 74. I would hate to think of how I could get along without it now. Been using it almost 1 year. If its to strong initially, get some gel caps and make 2 doses out of 1. Get your gel caps from Amazon.com."
1,Kids ordered,"I hate it was so easy for them to get. I was told to use parental block, but needed to know how to block from gaming"
4,Essential for Admirers,"""Compensation"" is not one of Ralph Waldo Emerson's best or most famous essays but is one of the most representative. The staunch optimism so essential to his thought was perhaps never shown so clearly or thoroughly elsewhere. Emerson begins by saying he had wanted to write about compensation since he was a boy, and it shows in his enthusiasm. He works himself up almost to a rhapsody, giving example after example in clear, beautiful prose that remarkably never becomes dull and is often near-lyrical. The essay details Emerson's belief that everything balances out, even if we cannot see it, and that good and evil have their own earthly rewards despite appearances. He may not convince cynics, but his argument is certainly compelling, and his critiques of conventional Christianity and other traditions are very intriguing. This is essential for anyone interested in Emerson, but the fact that it is in many collections makes it very hard to justify a standalone."
2,Finish Quality,"I installed the faucet approximately 7 months ago, and have actually used it for 3 months. The unit is very attractive and presents a touch of quaulity. The faucet is also very functional. It's the brush nickle finish that is unsatisfactory. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the metal was stainless steel. If it is made of stainless, it is a very poor quality. The metal surface is tarnished beyond anything that I expected, which now renders it unsightly. I checked the information provided with the product and it states that the finish is not covered if any harmful cleaners are used for cleaning. Well I haven't used any harmful products unless Dawn dish liquid is considerd harsh. Anyway, I would not have purchased this product if I had known about the poor quaulity of finish."
1,You Can Sort Faster By Hand,"This toys purpose is to sort your change, and it performs poorly. In mine, the quarters get stuck unless you pour coins in one by one, which takes forever. If you pour more than one coin in they get stuck or little coins fall into the slots for bigger coins. In mine the quarter got stuck in the dime slot blocking it, it no longer works."
2,Poor quality control,"When it works, it works well, but...The wiring came loose a day after getting it. Resoldered the wire and it worked fine. Then the switch gave out. Fixed that. It just went kaput again and I'm not so bored as to pull it apart a 3rd time.Given the other options available at a similar price, I would pass on this."
1,Not even a good toy,"I've had this sorter for several years.It jams regularly, unless you basically feed the coins one at a time.Today, it jammed permanently. I took it apart and the tiny motor is connected to little tiny plastic gears (what were they thinking?)that, apparently, stripped.I put the pieces in the garbage.Don't bother with this one. It's not even a good toy."
4,Great tool,"Great for rolling coins! It has worked really well so far, the extra coins gather in the spill over tray and the coins are always delegated to the right place. Make sure that you dont let the spillover tray get too full before you pop out the coin tray to roll them. Occasionally a coin from the spillover tray will fall making it hard to close the change chamber (but this can be easily avoided)"
1,Broke down after a few months,"The slide tray, after several months usage (no more than twenty times total) wont slide back in. There seems to be no access to the slide mechanism to try to fix it."
1,very disappointed,couldn't get reliable coin count in the wrapper. Had to dump and count anyway. Threw it in the trash after one week
3,Who is the jackass?,"I have purchased this as I am a fan of the craziness of the group. I just can't believe no one has really gotten hurt from the crazy practical jokes they play on one another. The 3D version of Jackass was terrible. It is getting tired, the same old stuff film after film... Like I put ...who is the jack ass..Me for spending the money and making them richer or them for the stupidity?"
3,jackass 3.5,i love JACKASS!!! i own the box set and all of the movies but i bought 3.5 thinking that the 3rd movie was on this dvd but it is all of the extra stuff from the 3rd movie.i like the extra stuff but was hoping the third movie was on here. guess i`ll have to buy the 3d version! i felt miss lead...
3,Too Much Pee Pee,I think the title speaks for itself. That is why I view this movie as the least liked one I have seen. I have not seen Jackass 3d. I thought 3.5 was 3 plus additional footage. Are they totally different?
5,<3,"Such a great movie. definitely a must buy for hardcore jackass fans like myself. Like the other movies, I can watch it over and over again"
4,A must for anyone suddenly confronted with a stroke,"The book is easy to read and takes the reader through the various stages of stroke recovery - the pain, the anger, the depression, the frustration, the acceptance and the gradual, very gradual road to recovery. Covering the pertinent and the practical aspects of strokes the book is amazingly written in a light hearted, and even entertaining style, for such a serious subject. It's easy to pick out relevant sections at different stages of recovery. I can highly recommend this book to both stroke sufferers but especially to their nearest and dearest as a way to try to understand and help the sufferer. There is hope - even when, at first, everything appears desperate. Read, enjoy and recover."
2,Below Average Early 80's Hardcore,"You're probably looking here as a result of listening to Slayer's album, ""Undisputed Attitude"" (1996). Slayer covers most of this album and does it in such crushingly brutal style, that the songs bear very little resemblance to what you'll hear here (assuming you don't heed my warning and waste your money buying this). The studio tracks sound flat and whiney, while the live ones are a little punchier, but easily annoy with instruments and vocals randomly cutting in and out.Verbal Abuse was somewhat popular in the early 80's hardcore punk scene, but they were less than mediocre as compared with their peers of the time. They play in the ""Nard-Core"" style, sounding similar to most bands released by Mystic Records (Ill Repute, Batallion of Saints, Dr. Know, etc.). Originally released in 1983, the production by today's standards is poor. To make things worse, it sounds like Beer City simply burned this straight off the vinyl."
3,No bad reviews here!,"This book is filled with about two dozen examples of web design; some are indeed excellent designs nicely illustrated and briefly annotated. Not a lot of text to bog you down; lots of pretty pictures to give you ideas. However, you may not agree with all the things that ""work,"" such as sites that require a specific window size or sites with busy/loud layouts. But whether you agree or not with all the author's comments, the book makes for a good idea reference. Plus, since many of the featured sites no longer exist, this book is one of the few ways to see some great designs that are no longer around."
3,Too few websites represented,"I found the book is very little in presenting what websites work, and why!"
2,Yawn,"Having watched Veggie Tales episodes and movies with my 9-year-old son since he was in pull-ups, we've sat through the good ones and the not-so-good ones. This is one of the not-so-good ones. While the animation is very well done, the story lacks punch and pace, the humor falls flat, the songs are tuneless and well below par, there isn't any emotional pull within the story and there aren't any female characters of note. Frankly, we both were bored."
4,Excellent,"Although this anime may seem to be geared more towards guys what with its large-breasted female heroines and action, I feel girls can still watch it to relate and for the romance. The packaging it came in was pretty good, the DVDs inside were also nice, but I feel like a book was meant to be a part of it, or perhaps that's just my mistake...either way it was brand new when I opened it so I guess not. I had only seen this anime once before (as in I hadn't really rewatched it) but I loved it, I watched episode after episode, almost addicted to it. But this anime has everything - confusion, action, drama, romance, you name it. I would recommend this to anyone but please watch it in the original Japanese, the English doesn't do it justice.Also, I am currently watching My-Otome and I find it different and definitely a whole lot more confusing...even reading the Wikipedias doesn't cease my confusion. If anyone could cease it for me...haha"
5,Surprise hit in my eyes,My-Hime at first was the typical girl with powers but as I came upon the second half of the series it got darker and things were revealed that I wasn't aware of. This is one of those sleeper hits that most anime enthusiast might bypass but its not. I highly recommend this title.
2,Pity about the script...,"Good idea, good cast, nice character for Jon Voight... pity about the script! The dialogue was very bad in places, and the villain's sudden switch at the end strained credibility one notch too many. As for the weird voiceover while Voight's character was struggling to reconnect with his former self... more like a book scene than a movie one."
2,It seems like an eternity...,"Reincarnation,the battle of good against evil,the rivalry of two brothers over the same woman,strange flashbacks--and Angelina Jolie's father--all in the SAME movie!Jon Voight stands up for Good (as well as the reincarnated gypsy girlfriend of his previous lifetime)against his eeeevil brother.The scenes from his previous lifetime look like they're from a Renaissance Faire,complete with bad acting (was the Society for Creative Anachronism hired as well???)One of the most hilarious scenes is the one in which a shirtless Voight cries out,""Connect me with my true self!"" over,over&over; again.Yes,it seems like an eternity.If you like cheesy reincarnation movies,this is perfect.Otherwise,if you want deeper fare,get ""Lara Croft:Tomb Raider."""
1,A Truly Awful Movie,This was a truly awful & dumb movie. Possibly the worst script ever for a film with major stars. The acting was good except for Voigt's way way over the top performance.
5,Great gluten free brownies,"Very good rich chocolate flavor, good texture. No soy, I am intolerant. Better flavor than Betty Crocker and again no soy problem. Best packaged gluten free dessert I have tried."
5,Deleriously good,"These are as good as any excellent regular mix brownies, & nearly as good as the best scratch fudge brownies I ever made. I made them several times, always with an added cream cheese ribbon, & they are outstanding. Fudgy, moist, melt-your-knees choco-bombs, they also freeze very well. If they weren't somewhat expensive, they'd be very dangerous; addictive. Forget a cake on my birthday...stick a candle into a pan of these & I'll dive in face-first."
2,Delicious but Deceiving,"Have made these brownies a few times, and they are delicious, HOWEVER, I'm up all night jittery and weird and tummy funky. The taste is tremendous, but I can't eat these again as I get so sick. Anybody know what it is? Is it the cocoa? It's the morning after, and my belly still aches, and I'm exhausted from being up all night, super jittery. I wish I could recommend them for gluten-free, but I get sick off something in them. Bummer!"
3,"OK, but not great","I really like all of the other Bob's Red Mill products, but I was disappointed in the brownies. They aren't bad...but they aren't great either. Betty Crocker's gluten free brownie mix is much better. This mix just lacks that fudgy taste that makes a brownie a brownie."
4,Dark chocolate brownies,"I really love Bob's Red Mill Gluten free products. They have a much better texture than many of the other packaged ""mixes"". I love that with these brownies I can make them to take with me to share because my family can't tell the difference between these from the regular gluten brownies. I am the only person who is gluten free in my family. The only downside to these brownies is that they have a very dark chocolate flavor. My kids didn't like them so I added and extra 1/2 to 1 cup of brown sugar to the mix. That made them taste like a traditional brownie. My kids love them now and so do I."
3,Great Brownies - Subpar Packaging,These brownies are easy to make and taste great. My only complaint is the packaging. Both of the two boxes I have received have had mix all over inside the box due to cracks in the packaging of the mixes. I've used several other products from Bob's Red Mill and this is the only product I've seen this packaging issue with.
2,Too Rich and Gave Me a Stomach Ache,"I like Bob's Red Mill products, but these are way, way too rich for my taste. The flavor is a super dark chocolate. I can't imagine adding more cocoa chips, as the package recommends. YUCK! I should also note that I had a stomach ache for over 24 hours. Not sure if I was having a reaction to the rich taste or perhaps the gluten that may be in the chocolate."
3,Didnt pass with the kids,"These brownies are okay. I added choc chips, which I think was the savior for the adults. They did not, however, go over with the kids. (ages 7,5, and 2) They are more ""cake like"" and weren't as fudgy as the real thing. This was the first time I threw away a batch of brownies in my house."
2,Bob's Red Mill,"I ordered a 4 package case of Bob's Red Mill gluten free brownie mix with great anticipation, but when I opened the case all four plastic packages were open. I did not throw them out, but have not yet used any...a little afraid. The packaging is just not good enough."
2,be carefull,"I added this to my '97 SVT Cobra when I added the Vortech S/C. Workedgreat for about 6-8 months, then I started haveing to re-set it evry 6-8 weeks, no big deal right?, Then it started not starting if the car sat for more than 3 days, not the battery lots of cranking power, so I took it back to Extreme Auto In Canoga park. They found nothing wrong and it was starting OK again. Took it home, drove it everday, things were OK, drove it every other day, things were OK, drove it every third day, WOULD NOT START!! Back to Extreme, again they found nothing wrong. Home again and exactly same thing!! Took it back to Extreme, they put it back to STOCK and no more trouble agter 8 months. SO BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!!"
4,Thanks Ben,"I wish I had read this book before going to college. I became involved in animal rights activism and the pro-choice movement. It wasn't until I joined the real world that I began to see the light. I blindly voted Democrat until I was 28 years old.Looking back now, I can see how I was manipulated by liberal teachers and the mainstream media. Cable TV news did not exist back then. It wasn't until I started to examine the issues on my own that I realized I was not really a liberal at all. I have read Mr. Shapiros columns online & he is a very thoughful writer. This book will be an eye opener for those who may not be aware of how liberal colleges have become."
1,The book doesn't have a a shred of fact...,"The book lacks a more through examination of the entire academic system. It seems to be a blatant attempt to discredit the academia. I have gone through the academic system as a college student-and found many inspiring ideas there-some of which conservatives like Shapiro would recoil at-like Amnesty International. I was very happy that the academic system is a way of inspiring open dialogue on a variety of issues like rich vs poor in an economic society or US domination in the world.Conservatives like Shapiro ought to understand that the typical college or university is a place to learn a variety of ideas-an example would be literature written by minority, gay/lesbian or women authors-which must be encouraged and taught for sake of diversity. Mr Shapiro cannot impose his will on many others-and he needs to understand that the place of academia is a place to learn a lot of ideas."
1,"If Universities brainwash us, why aren't there more liberals?","The premise of this book is that Liberals in Universities are brainwashing our children. If college graduates are indoctrinated by liberals, why aren't there more liberals out there? And does this mean that in order to be a conservative, you can't go to college? Hmm....College = Liberal, no college = Conservative. Please let me know if I got this wrong."
