5,Powerfull Little Device!,"I've had this recorder for almost a year. I've dropped it, gotten it wet, and it's still ticking! Never had any problems with it; it's been a huge asset in my record keeping. I HIGHLY recommend this recorder!!!"
1,Be careful with pets and children.,I have this and while it works good its dangerous for pets and kids. Not saying its a bad product just warning everyone. We were having a BBQ and i used the hanger on the tool and hung it on my grill. My 100# dog ran by and it caught his side and ripped his skin down to his ribs 6 inches long and pulled the hot coals on top of him. He tried to run from the coals while the hook just dug deeper into his side. Lots of stitches and burns. This could have easily been a small child that this could have happened too.
5,Sharp but great,I used the pig tail for the first time when I cooked rib eye steaks out on the gas grill. It was just as advertised. You make a small puncture in the meat and flip it. I made sure to wash the pig tail before eating so no one would get stabbed. Someone could write a murder mystery with the pig tail as the weapon.
3,Extremely sharp,This is a tool for focused and aware bbq'rs. A very dangerous tool otherwise and must be locked up when not in use in the convenient wooden box it is shipped in. Certainly does the meat flipping job.
1,CHEAP,"for a product with the name of jensen i thought i would be getting a better set of headphones,cheap, plastic non adjustable head gear with so so speakers. dont buy these."
3,Fair price...so so quality,"I bought the one in burgundy color. It looks very nice. Very comfortable. Only drawback is quality is not as good as I expected. Especially the finishing has not been done properly. You'll find some stray threads coming out from here and there on the inside of the comforter. But, once I cut them with a scissor, everything was good. Another thing you might want to notice is that this set doesnt come with a bed sheet. They could have easily added a matching bed sheet and charged a few dollars more!"
2,DO NOT DRY,"This set was nice, but it is dry clean only. My husband accidently put the comforter in the dryer on low and the comforter had spots that turned orange."
1,Mine was ruined after a week.,"Of course this was dry clean only. I had to get it washed after a week and even that ruined it, so the next time I simply washed it myself and now its completely destroyed. It did look nice for the 3 days I had it."
4,Very comfortable,Extremely comfortable set. All items are great quality. My only suggestion from personal experience is that you don't use this during the summer because it becomes too hot to sleep in
5,Well worth it!!,"I love my comforter, I've been looking for something to put on my bed that would be for my husband and myself and this is perfect, not only does it look nice but it feels nice too."
4,Good Buy - for the price,It's really nice for the price. I just purchased based on the reviews. It's turned to be a good buy. I was little disappointed that the fitted sheet is not part of it.
1,poor quality,"I purchased this item and then returned it b/c the quality is poor. the problem is the fabric lining the back side is very thin and cheap feeling. also the batting feels like poor quality polyester batting that looks like it would bunch up over time. i returned this and bought a microsuede duvet from overstock instead. it was more, but worth it b/c it is actually machine washable."
1,Junker,"This set looked pretty sweet online... and gets you thinkin ""microsuede eh? bet that'd feel pretty good and all"" right? Wrong!Couldn't believe the uncomfortable nasty material that the comforter was filled with. The whole underside is made of cheapas thin cloth that will rip in a few hours. I got it for the bedskirt, and even that is sketchy. The shams top off this sham, the material is just not very well constructed.Well I guess I can believe it, remembering that they marked it down to theertyfiyve. Last time I ordered a comforter marked down on amazon it was great, so I guess I expected something worth owning. Oh well. Maybe someday I'll get a dog, and have a use for it."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"We all know the old adage ""you get what you pay for."" If you were thinking that the Amazon price looks like a good deal on a good bedding set, let me dissuade you. This comforter is cheap in more than one sense of the word.The microsuede is mediocre. The inner lining feels like $2 gym shorts. The seams are abrasive. The polyester filling feels like fiberglass and it clumps and forms ridges in the comforter. The bedskirt ... well, actually isn't all that bad, but be warned that it won't fit deep mattresses.That said, it's a comforter set. It does what comforters do well enough and it looks good after some ironing and steaming. But, it's a low quality product for a low price, *not* a deal."
3,Was nice but HAVE TO DRY CLEAN,This bedding is very nice but the one reason we dont use it anymore is because I guess I either dont kno much about the fabric or I just didnt pay attention but its now ruined because i tried to wash it..even on delicate it is ripped and the soap will not come off...its a shame because it really is a nice set.
5,VERY NICE!!!,"this Item is pretty good, I think you will not find other better for that price. Is very soft and confortable."
4,Better than expected,"We love our new comforter. I purchased this to replace our down comforter that had been ruined by our cat. This comforter is much bigger than the average queen, which makes it almost impossible for someone to ""steal"" all the covers. It is super soft and warm. Cat loves it as well but there are no feathers for him to try to get at and rip open.I never expected a comforter at this low price to be so great!"
2,Dry clean only,"The comforter is handsome enough, however I would have like to have known that it is dry-clean only. I have a cat and that makes dry-clean only bedclothes impractical. I would definitely not have bought this item had I known."
4,sleep at last!!!!!!!!,"wow, perfect cure for insomnia and what a saving!!!nice packaging and great product, only down side is that I did not realise that it was recommended to be dry cleaned only..... with a bottle feeding daughter this may be an issue.I am currently considering a 2nd set."
4,So soft...,"This comforter is so soft. I really have no complaints other than it could be just a tad longer and wider to accomodate a double pillowtop mattress, but it is pretty close."
5,Great value,This set was a great value for $40.. Just wish it came with pillow cases. Would definatelty get this product again for another bed
2,"Eh. 1 or 2 star item, (three if price is considered)","Bought it on a gold box for $40, so the value is there.It looks nice, and has a nice feel. Very light weight. Underside is a little scratchy, keep the sheets between you and the comforter.Care: Dry clean Suggested! You must be kidding. Cleaning would be nearly as expensive as the item. I'll chance the washing machine (haven't tried it yet)I have the moss, which is a very nice dark green."
2,Speechless,"The product was nice to look at when i got it. BUT....it looked used. the tags was torn off (you could see where they were attached) and there was spots of stuff (??) dried on it. gross! Needless to say i returned it. Other than that it was soft, not too heavy, and pretty. Wouldnt be a bad buy if you actually could get a clean, new one."
1,Garbage,This set is cheap cheap cheap - something you would find at Big Lots. I returned mine the same day I got it - it will not last.
2,Microsuede King comforter set,"I would never ever consider paying $200.00 for this set. At $50.00 what I paid I still feel it is way to thin,will probably fall apart if I wash it and while it looks nice enough it is kindof patched together in odd spots."
4,good,"It is close to what i was looking for and I could receive it within 2 days. But, I still do not know how I should wash that."
1,disappointed,"I received this set in a timely manner but I didn't open it for a couple of weeks. When I opened it and was going to put the set on my bed I found that the comforter was a double size and the rest of the set was a king size. So needless to say, I cannot use this set at all. I buy from Amazon often but this was really a disappointment."
2,Color off,"This was nice but you get what you pay for, the comforter was a little cheap and the color was not reddish but more purple, did not look like the picture"
5,GREAT SENIOR BEDDING,"I ordered this comforter for my mother's bed. She sleeps ON comforters rather than UNDER them. She says that it's the most comfortable comforter-sheet she has slept on so far. It isn't fancy, but it is SOOOOO soft. Mom likes it so much that I'm ordering another for her and one for myself. ENJOY!!"
3,Fine for the money,I couldn't find anything I liked that wasn't over $200.00 so this set makes a great interim purchase.
3,Flimsy,"$40 is no great deal; this set is not worth more. The tag recommends Dry Cleaning, but I've put the comforter through a cold water wash and it was fine. It's doubtful this set will make it through the end of the year; it is just too flimsy and I won't be buying another."
5,Very nice set for the price,"I'm kind of surprised at those who expected ""better"" quality. I thought the quality was comparable to department stores and home stores. I ordered the paisley and the burgundy and both are very nice. Th paisley looked very rich in my bedroom and I was thrilled.I had a more expensive set from Linens and things but this one actually is better looking."
5,Great deal!!,My son just LOVES this set! He is 13 and I told him the new bedding set was not going in to his room until it was cleaned up!...LOL... The next morning I awoke to his room clean and him sleeping under the covers of his new bedding!!
3,Good Value for the price.,"Not bad comforter for the price. It says dry clean only (it's all polyester), but my son has allergies, so I washed in hot water and dried in the dryer - no problem (yet). If you're on a budget, this does the trick."
3,good price for the quality,"for only 30$$ its a good buy, keeps you warm and looks good. the lining is kind of thin on the underside but like i said only 30$. so im happy with it."
4,I Love It!,"I paid $39.99 for the set. I got queen size - and it is perfectly generous sizing for my queen bed. I found the comforter cosy warm, not thin at all, and the material is soft and just really cosy and comfortable. It looks great - no flaws or bits about to fall apart. It looks solid. I've had it a month and I am still very happy. I would have paid more for it. The only reason it is 4 star is that I can't throw it in the washing machine. Otherwise - love it. Edit: 3 years later and I still love this thing! It still looks great and its the warmest comforter I've ever had."
4,Thick and soft,"Very thick and nice to touch. My son gets hot easy so it was too heavy for him but his brother loves it. Very good price. Bought 2, we liked it so well."
3,Good to buy but be aware of ur cost to wash it,I bought this one with a very low price compare to the original one. It is very comfortable. I recommend this product for any one who want to try microsuede material but you should be aware of high cost of washing. It took me almost $50 to wash everything (special care for this type of material)
5,Comforter set,This comforter looks better in actual use than it does in the picture. Now how often can a person say that? Very comfortable and worth every single cent I paid for it. Well made and very warm and it looks excellent with my room decor.
4,Great,"i bought this set cause it was 29.99 and i thought what a great price ill try it. I got it and i love it . I live in california and the weather is cold in the winter just right in the spring and hot in the summer, This comforter is perfect."
5,I'm a Parrothead for LIFE!,"For her 62nd birthday, I took my mother to her first open air concert to hear Jimmy Buffett. She even made THE DALLAS MORNING NEWS. I promised her a good time...my husband, son, mother and I wore matching authentic Hawaiian shirts, turned my van into a Parrotmobile, threw a tail gate party and had a blast! My mother is now 72, a Buffett devotee and can sing all his songs by heart! Even THE BEAR!Anyone who criticizes Buffett has never REALLY listened to his music. He's a fantasic storyteller and chronicles us babyboomers with eerie accuracy.I was fortunate enough to see Buffett before he had to stop doing THE BEAR in concert. This CD is your chance to hear it as only Buffett can do it.While other CD's might have more well-known songs, this one has THE BEAR, PENCIL THIN MOUSTACHE, and THE BALLAD OF SPIDER JOHN. Enough said.Enjoy!"
5,He got it right!,"I probably own 15 JB albums, however, this one remains my all time favorite. I have been to Ringling, Montana, and Jimmy got it absolutely perfect in describing the ""dyin little town."" This is quintissential Jimmy. When people ask me why I like him, I say that he is a troubador of the 20th century and this album is a perfect overview of the best that he has to offer. From Come Monday, a classic JB lovesong, to a silly parody of the music industry ""who can either go country or pop"", this is the best. When my niece starting listening to him in the early 90's I bought her this album, and told her she could really not claim to be a fan, until she owned this one."
4,Good overview of African Political Systems,A good review of African political systems and regimes during colonialism and post-colonialism eras. A good comparative study of these political institutions and African sociological issues affecting these governments.
5,Androids have feelings too,"The Culture Festival is here and Aya's Steel Snow is underway. Although there is lots of humor in the series, this volume is mostly serious and even the play's story is pretty interesting. I've noticed how well Masami Tsuda expresses her characters through simple facial looks. Did anyone feel a little uneasy with Arima's look towards the end? It just makes me yearn that much more for volume 10. Also, Tonami makes a big decision despite the painful consequence it may hold for him. And Tsubasa is so *kawaii* as Antique!<SIGH> Fellow fans, the wait for each volume is so worth it."
1,Max found two boring stick's,"This book beeped. He only says one word in the whole story.Its the stupidest book ever it is only worth 1 point on reading counts.If I had to rate this book on a scale on 1 to 10,it would be a 10.ten being the worst."
4,Max Got Two Fingers,"Pinkney returns with a somewhat hackneyed attempt to draw a veil over the real problems facing a child growing up in the inner city with his latest effort - ""Max Found Two Sticks"". At no point does he elaborate on the fact that Max had to root around in a pile of used needles, empty glue tins and worn rubbers before he found said sticks. Sure, the tap-a-long rhythms are fun, for a while, but that's missing the point somewhat, as 15 minutes beating the bassline to House of Pain's seminal classic - ""Jump Around"" on the violin case of a sleeping busker does not a happy childhood make. Get with the program - buy your child a real drumkit instead. It'll keep them off the streets."
3,A good book to read,The story is about a boy who found two sticks and used them to play on things. We liked the story because Max played music on things. We didn't like this story because we didn't like the pictures. Many people should read this book because it's a good story.
4,Wonderful,"This book clearly takes place in NYC, something my NYC nieces and I really enjoy - seeing Max's dad being a conductor on a train makes them laugh. Seeing the WTC in the background makes me smile and think. And of course the kids up and down the block where we live spend their life sitting on the stoop, just like Max does!The book makes great connections - each time somebody asks Max what he's doing, he plays the sound of something going on, and in the next panel he's using their bucket, or their hatbox, or their garbage cans to play his next rhythm.I strongly recommend this book to anyone, particularly anybody who is musically inclined.One note - the larger edition of this book is better. I got this edition because it was cheaper and in the bookstore, but the pictures end up a little scrunched."
2,Max Found Two Sticks,A boy named Max found two sticks and started to play drums on stuff like trash cans. Then a marching band came around the corner and the last man gave him two drumsticks. We didn't like when the twins were showing off their hats because they were boasting. Adults and children should read this book because it is a good book to read.
2,A fun story about a Boy who finds Two Sticks.,"Max finds two sticks and does rhythms with them. We liked the book because Max gets sticks and plays them on many different things. What we didn`t like in the story was when everyone asked "" what are you doing with those sticks?"" too often. Anyone should read this book because it is a fun story to read. Lots of people should also read this book because it is exiting and surprising."
3,All Three Stars Are for Boleyn - Not this book!,"Only one's fascination with the Tudor lifestyle and legacy will keep you crawling thru this book to the end. Since we all know Bolelyn's dramatic and tragic story, if it needs to be RETOLD, it must be done in an innovative way, when being recounted for the thousandth time. What it did NOT need, was to be filtered thru an ""US Magazine"" thesaurus!...Language like ""partied"", ""awesome"", and ""bump"" (for pregnancy), are actually used in their modern context! This is Tudor history... for Paris Hilton!"
1,Very disappointing . . .,"A very confused telling of a familiar story, jarring modern slang, and distortion of historical facts. I have rarely been more disappointed in a book. I though I'd list it on Amazon and get rid of it (and get a portion of my purchase price back), but the depreciation on the price of the book is worse than a new car! Don't waste your time on this. I agree with some of the other critics - how the heck does a piece of junk like this get published?"
2,"An entertaining read,but...","While this book was an interesting read, and reasonably accurate as far as the events go, I found it a bit dissapointing in other ways. The chapters about Lucy are the best part of the book; it's a very accurate depiction of the average commoner's view of Anne Boleyn, and the whole divorce situation.The chapters concerning Anne are much less effective. This is yet another book where Anne is the calculating shrew, and Henry is the poor henpecked fool in love with her. Like a lot of books written about Anne, the portrayal of Anne (and Henry) is very one-sided; Anne is bad, Henry is good.That being said, I would have liked this book much more if not for its rather jarring use of modern day language. I found it very distracting and really kind of annoying. It's not that I was expecting the author to use historically accurate phrasing or anything, but it's really ridiculous to have Anne greeting a courtier with the phrase, ""What's up?"" It's just irritating after a while."
2,The Worst!,"This is the most boring book I've read on Anne Boleyn. The language used in the book is too modern, not in context at all - when did this happen, in the 80s? Sure seems like it from the prose. Too random and needs an editor. Frances's? What the hell. Blah, Allison Weir and Jean Plaidy bring the true Anne to life."
1,Didn't realize Anne was a teenage girl from Jersey!,"As a big fan of the Tudor period, I was excited at the idea of a new book about Anne Boleyn. After reading a few pages, I noticed a modern slang term. Initially, I thought it was an editing error. Then, I read another, then another. Finally, when I read about Francis ""Franky"" Norris, I knew I was finished with this book. Modern verbage in the mouth of a 1500's heroine just does not fit and distracts the reader's attention from the story. I cannot imagine how this book got published and I was happy that I got my copy from the library. Absolutely awful."
2,utterly disappointed,"I agree with most of the other reviews on this book. I love everything about Tudor history, especially the history of Anne Boleyn and her daughter, Elizabeth. I have read many other books about Anne Boleyn, but this one made me put it down after only 10 pages. I could not get over the use of language in this book. It was as if I were listening to a modern day sorority girl. I was completely turned off by the way Anne, who is probably one of my favorite women in history, was portrayed. I even picked up another Anne Boleyn book and read some of it after reading Sarah Dunn's to clear my head of her writing. I have not been so disappointed in a book in my life!"
2,Boleyn boring?,"I had a hard time swallowing this book. The portrayal of Anne was too ""innocent victim"" for me. I really couldn't sympathize with this character nor could I find her believable. Duhn made it seem like Anne went from having no interest in Henry (or power) to all of a sudden a power hungry queen. It went too quickly victim to demon. I personally find it hard to swallow that with all of the many ambitious young women in court that Anne Boleyn just fell into Henry's lap. To me there must have been some real scheming involved.I also question the use of Lucy Cornwallis (confectioner). I realize that most of the other reviewers enjoyed her role but I found her very long segments to have little to say about Anne. I personally don't pick up a book about Anne Boleyn to read about candy making. I've read much better books surrounding these events : The Other Boleyn Girl by Pilippa Gregory, and King Henry VIII by Margaret George."
3,Give it a try,"I wasn't all that thrilled with the vernacular, slang and jarring use of profanity (I have no problem with the f-word but it's distracting to hear it from the Queen of England). But I kept reading, which has not been the case with many other novels that tell this well-told story. It's something different.Just to clarify: many of the objections here are about language. This seems to lead people to think that we're demanding the ""Hark, prithee, for I shall smite thee, varlet"" type of stuff. No thanks. Modern language is one thing--if Anne Boleyn and her crew spoke like 21st century royalty/nobility, that'd be one thing. But we are subjected to descriptions like ""cute Franky Weston"" and ""Hank Norris"" and lots of other colloquialisms. A historical author's job is to balance what we think the time period should be with his/her closest approximation of how it really was. Whichever side you end up coming down on, it's got to be believable. This was just a plain stupid choice."
1,Very Disappointed,I just finish reading this book. Boring............ I'm sorry I 've bought this book. This is the most boring book I've every read on Anne Boleyn.I found Lucy part very lifeless.This book is just not worth it.
2,Disappointing......,"I've read many novels and biographies about Anne Boleyn and also her daughter, Elizabeth, and this one was disappointing. Anne came across as such a conniving, self-centered shrew that by the end you were glad her head was chopped off. The confectioner, Lucy, was far more likeable and her voice added a strength to the novel that Anne's did not."
4,Okay but...,"This is a good album, but somehow, for me, not quite as interesting or satisfying as ""Katonah."" They sound a little more commercialized to me, especially on Phoney Maroney and Today is the Day. My favorite tune on this release is the last one, ""Bed"" which has some nice harmonies, and reminds me a little of Yo La Tengo, the legendary Indie band. If this is your first time hearing Apollo then you really need to get ""Katonah"" instead. That one will knock your socks off! This cd is a decent second album from this up and coming group."
3,HILARIOUS!,MUST BUY IT. ADDS SOMETHING FUNNY AS HELL TO YOUR COLLECTION OF COMEDYS. I HAVE BOTH SETS AND LOVE THEM BOTH!
2,Not very well produced...,"This is a YOUTUBE style instructional video for those of you looking to dance at bikini bars or topless establishments (it's not all pole dancing). 4 music style variations of exotic dance. This is contemporary example of what you see at 'mens clubs' currently. Nice pro tips and approach for a beginner but if you are looking for actual GO GO, you will want more burlesque moves which this does not have. I guess it would also work if you want to impress your boyfriend but not appropriate for regular club dancing unless you want a lot of unwelcome attention. Kudos to the girl for making it - she is right, there is limited instruction in this area. But for the content and the production, is only worth about half the price."
5,for professionals,"i expected to learn more moves from it. the moves she taught were very good though. this is more useful if you want to become a professional go go dancer. she gave some pretty good tips about becoming a professional, such as what to wear , where to get them, how to audition etc"
3,Dissapointment,The video was one step above a home movie. The girl must have done the video on the firt take. Her instructions were not step by step. Imagine you 17 year old cousin teaching you how to dance and you have a good idea of how this video plays out.
2,Not worth the price,It demonstrates barely any moves; about 20 moves total. I only liked it because it was the only one of its kind out there. It's difinetely for someone who wants a job as a gogo dancer because it talks about what to wear and where to audition. Not what I hoped it would be...
5,"Dated, but fantastic book","This is the best practical book I've come across on technology in ministry. It was written in 2001, so it doesn't really deal with social media, but it does deal with the Internet and its effects on church life. How do we train people in the skills of media literacy? What type of technology is appropriate for the liturgy? How is Internet affecting the mission of the Church? Part theological, part theoretical, and two parts practical, this book answers these questions from many angles.The author, Dan Andriacco, is the Communications Director for the Archdiocese of Cincinatti making this one of the few books covering technology and religion written from a Catholic perspective."
5,A great eye-opener into money management!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to everyone I know, Christian believer or not. It's an excellent financial handbook for young adults as well as adults who want to learn how to better manage the money they have and increase it to get the things they want. This book helped me to admit I was a ""consumer"" and encouraged me to develop a stronger ""producer"" viewpoint of my money. I'm on the road to financial recovery and it was easier than I thought."
4,A Variety of Recipes,"Only tried one of the recipes so far, but based on that there are other candidates. These recipes are good for vegetarians and others as well. Healthy one dish meals."
5,A Beautiful and Creative Cookbook,"I purchased this as a present for a friend who was graduating from college. He's not the most cooking-saavy individual, but the colorful pictures and clear instructions in this book made him want to begin making beautiful bowls of soup right away. Although the selection of recipes is not as wide as one might hope (more space than I would like is taken up by ""dessert soups""), everything in the book is delicious and presented in creative, eye-appealing ways."
5,Best Soup Cookbook I Own,"This is hands-down the best cookbook for soup I own. While I've bought others in the years since I got this one as a gift, and clipped recipes from magazines, this is the book I return to again and again. They are classic recipes, (cream of tomato, lentil, etc...) but usually the best version of the soup you've ever had with an interesting topping, accompaniment or flavor you wouldn't have thought of on your own. Paulette Mitchell writes clear, casual instructions, and she has become one of my favorite cookbook authors - try her vegetarian sandwich cookbook for great soup / sandwich combos!"
4,A quality device,"I originally purchased this recorder to take minutes in meetings. In both HQ and SP modes, the quality of recording is very good for this purpose, assuming use of headphones when transcribing. In an outdoor setting, with people seated around a standard size folding table and holding the recorder so that it can be pointed toward the person speaking, the VCVA (voice activation) function was an excellent performer, even with a few people who mumble, and saved having to deal with blocks of silence. In LP mode, the quality of recordings is awful, but still salvageable (laborious task of playing file into computer as a wave file, then performing noise reduction on file) allows use of such files. If the time provided by SP is adequate for your purposes, this is an excellent and cost effective choice."
2,"OK for personal messages, but don't try to dictate","Although this digital voice recorder's (DVR) customer- and editorial reviews are accurate, they fail to identify one important flaw!With a DVR, (unlike audio microcassette recorders) you can NOT rewind over an erroneous word and rerecord it. If you are using the DVR to dictate, you will not be able to back up and restate anything said in error.This is a major drawback."
2,Skip this!!,"Why put this on dvd?? There is to much ancient junk in it and there is minimum dueling. The orichalcos, give me a break, legendary dragons that become knights, junk. The only reason I gavew this a 2 is because its yu-gi-oh and i'm a loyal fan and card player. My advice to funimation is to go straight to the kc grand championship. That was dueling dueling dueling, not to mention short sweet an to the point."
2,No way to seal these,"They are indeed bottle to hold ketchup, mustard and mayo, but they have no caps. There's not any way to seal them up."
3,Tops?,"These are really nice bottles... But they didn't come with caps. I bought them to hold vinager, soap... I don't want them to evaperate."
5,Trois bouteilles rétro.,"J'aime ces articles parce qu'ils représentent notre jeunesse. Aussi, ils sont de bonne qualité.Les couleurs sont voyantes et jolies.Merci beaucoup."
4,"Good bottle, but why no caps?","I like these bottles. They squeeze out nice, soft durable plastic, the tops stay on (good thread contact), but if you wish to store the condiments long term there are no caps. There are ridges for the caps, but are not with the product. BTW, I use a small piece of plastic wrap to seal it up, as the contents will dry up some (and block the spout) if you don't use it frequently.I also like the images, and look nice in the fridge, or on the picnic table. They are also less messy than the containers that come in the store, even if you still have to take the time to squeeze it from one to the other."
3,These don't come with caps!,"Unlike most plastic squeeze bottles, this set DOES NOT come with those little red CAPS. Odd since the spout has the usual edge on it to hold a cap to the nozzle. We just assumed that these had caps."
5,NICE SQUEEZE BOTTLES / SEE CUSTOMER IMAGES OF CAPS,"I bought these bottles to use as a space saver in the refrigerator in our motor home. they fit great on the door shelves so much better then the big bulky store bought squeeze bottles of mustard/ketchup/bbq sauce. I like all the other reviewers wished they came with covers. I did find that using electrical plastic wire caps (not sure what there called) like the ones used when hooking two wires together like in ceiling fans they work great, they come in red white & yellow. I will post pitchers of what I'm talking about when I get my camera back but even with out caps I never had anything leak out when tipped over the hole is to small. as far as the printing on the bottles washing off never had a problem with that happening even if it did its no big deal. these squeeze bottles work great I'm glad I bought them will be buying more."
3,Picnic use,I would of loved if they made these smaller for a picnic basket but they are cute and ok as far as using in the backyard. They really need a top so if you tip them they don't spill out anything.
1,what a rip off,"all you have to do is go ta da copyright office and see that this book was actually copyrighted by Don Iarussi many years before. Iarussi put out his bookl himself under that label of nytex press.Amazon, you can look it up.the book here is a pathetic attempt by some pinhead elitist to have a clue . this book belongs with the coney island whitefish"
1,I have not as yet received a replacement for the defective one.,"The DVD had a visible defect on the side that has the image. I put it in my DVD player and it ran for about 5 minutes and if froze up and would not continue to play. I sent the DVD back with the reason why I was doing so. I am still waiting for a replacement. I am really looking forward to seeing the movie ""The Hero's of Telemark. Fred Spitzer"
4,Heroes of Telemark,"Although a certain amount of the movie is gratuitously taken up by Kirk Douglas' love life, the story is not only a true one but the filming was done at some of the exact same locations--to include the heavy water factory. Several books and articles have been written on the actual events which were the stuff of legend."
1,Missing 2nd half of show. Disc missing.,The end of the show is missing. It looks like there should have been 2 discs; but I got only 1. I would like to see the end of the show. Could you please send me 2nd disc.
4,WWII Action,"A classic movie of behind the scenes WWII action in occupied Norway. Not exactly true to history, but Hollywood made it a little more interesting that way."
5,Heroes FInally on DVD,"I really enjoyed finally getting this movie on DVD after a long search. Turns out I was not using the correct title in my search.Good quality and glad to get subtitles also. I have read other reviews that were not as kind. However my wife and I enjoyed knowing some more truth about the Occupied parts of the world in the WWII days. I notice one thing same music backing on this movie as on The Inn of the Sixth Happiness about Gladys Allward, Missionary to China just before and during the Japanese attack there."
3,little-remembered true story,"Set during WW II this is the story of how a few Norwegians risked everything to stop the Nazi acquisition of ""heavy water"" to build bombs. Their story is still re-told in Norway."
4,More or Less How it Happened.,"The movie follows the account of when how and why the heavy water shipment was sunk into the fjord, at least for the most part. The reality was even more grim, since few were saved off the ferry sinking. But, for Hollywood, the story is pretty well told, and the scenery is great."
4,Beautiful Restoration,"These comments refer to the Columbia Pictures ""Combat Classics"" release of ""The Heroes of Telemark""Never mind what you read elsewhere, *this* release is a beautiful restoration, with very clean, crisp video and a clear soundtrack. The story is also interesting and well-played, based (at least loosely) on Allied efforts to stop WWII German production of ""Heavy Water"" (Deuteriun oxide) in Norway as part of a Nazi nuclear weapons program.2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen"
1,One of my favorite MOvies Worst DVD I have,"You know Great cast, great movie But, I think if I had a good VHS copy I could do a better job transfering it to disk. Picture and sound quality are terrible. it looks like some went into a movie threater with a camera and microphone. really a disapointment. I think amazon should ban this distributor."
1,TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I viewed this movie when I was young when it first came out and was overjoyed to see it was available on DVD. I received it today and I am very, very, very diappointed. It was made in Malasia by the chinese I think, and it looks terrible, like a bad quality VHS. It was likely copied from something, and I am surprised Amazon would carry something like this. I will be sending it back!"
3,Great movie! Poor DVD.,"I bought this DVD because the movie, which I have seen on TV, is truly wonderful. However, upon receiving and playing the DVD, I found the sound track to be muddled and the dialogue hard to understand at times. The video reproduction is ok."
1,"AVOID THIS AWFUL, MUTILATED COPY","""Heroes of Telemark"" is a very fine film, an exciting and informative war drama. Unfortunately, this copy has nothing to commend it to the buyer. It's a very inferior transfer, for one thing. For another, and most importantly, it's savagely mutilated. ""Heroes"" was originally filmed in widescreen (2.35:1). This copy has been cut to ribbons and offered to you at a lousy ""full"" screen of 1.33:1. Full screen, my aching arse. This is just an advertising ploy to dupe the consumer. The only FULL screen is the aspect of the original filming. The so-called ""full"" screen here gives you about 60% of the film. Do you really want to pay good money for a butchered copy of a horrid transfer? Only a sap volunteers to be fleeced. Don't be a sap."
3,Heroic War Story in Snow,"I purchased this DVD thinking the quality would be better in a DVD, than the VHS I had. I was very disappointed in the quality, although the story was an adventure to behold. The bravery of these men in World War 2 to stop the manufacture of hard water to prevent Germany from making the Atom Bomb was awe-inspiring. However, I felt the love story between Kirk Douglas and his ex-wife in the movie, was a distraction we didn't need and almost took away the heroic aspect of the movie. All in all a worthy effort. Richard Harris and Michael Redgrave were very good in their parts also."
2,Great movie but lousy quality,Heros of Telemark is still one of my most favorite war films. I bought the film in VHS format a long time ago and it has not aged well. I recently purchased a dvd of the film from Amazon. I found the picture quality to be poor and the sound was muffled at times to the point I could not understand what was said. I returned it to Amazon. Great movie...lousy quality.
4,Datalore,"In this episode, the Enterprise goes to the planet where Data was created. While there, they discover Data's ""brother"" Lore -- an android created before Data and who looks exactly like Data. It soon becomes apparent that Lore is not the sweet and innocent android that Data is as Lore attempt to destroy the Enterprise the same way he destroyed his creators.This marks the first of many appearances of Lore."
2,"Interesting stories, but lost in poor writing","When I purchased the book, I was excited by the chance to see these deadly viruses from an insider's perspective. The first hand accounts of the authors' experiences with Ebola, Lassa and other viruses were interesting, but difficult to follow as they skipped back and forth in time and, in some cases, between each of the two author's perspectives. My overall impression was that the book needed a good editor. For those who are interested in the topic, I agree with others' recommendations to read The Coming Plague by Laurie Garrett. It's very long, but very readable, and offers a much more coherent reporting of many of the events discussed by McCormick and Fisher-Hoch."
3,"Great Reading, Fascinating, But.............","The stories are true, the people fascinating, the viruses even more fascinating. A great read, very informative. However, since I've read other books on the same subject I'm not sure I feel comfortable with the criticisms doled out by McCormick and Fisher-Hoch on some of their colleagues. What's up with that?? Get over it, we're all in this together. Loved Fisher-Hoch's story, great to get a females's perspective, found McCormick to be more reserved, cautious."
4,Yikes!,"Another book about the CDC which will absolutely send shivers up your spine! Scarier than fiction because fiction, it ain't! The next time somebody sneezes on an airplane you're on you just might freek out!"
5,reads like a story versus a textbook,"If you like viruses, this book is interesting and educational about the epidemiology and transmission of very intense and scary viruses around the world."
3,Uneven but still enjoyable,"""Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC"" is the story of two researchers for the Centers for Disease Control who spend years in Africa, treating and researching such diseases as Lassa, Ebola, and HIV. Some of the stories are fairly interesting and my eyes were opened to some of the circumstances faced by folks living in central Africa. But the book feels like it lacks a point; it's really a collection of short recollections (4-20 pages each), sometimes with very little tying them together. More maps would have been useful, and the end of the book has more information about ""level 4"" labs constructed to examine these viruses in safety. The book wasn't a waste of time but it didn't have what I was looking for, which was a focus on the mindset of the doctors as they investigated the various viruses. It's pretty decent evening reading, though."
1,HOLLYWOOD STINK VAMPYR/STINKEY KNIGHT CHILLS,"BOTH MOVIES STUNK.DON'T KNOW HOW THEY EVER MADE MOVIES OF THEM. THEY HAD TO LOOSE MONEY ON THEM. THATS ALL I GOT TO SAY ABOUT THEM. RATE A ""0""."
1,fun while it lasted,Toy was pretty neat. Battery doesn't last long. You would think its a boat hello its gonna be in water. The motor was exposed to where you have to install battery and with a little leak that all she wrote for this little boat.Less than 8 hours of owner ship my son now has a broken boat.
2,inaccurate and based on discarded material. time for an updated account.,"From the quality of this, I will assume that it is an older documentary. In which case, the out-dated information is forgivable. This is interesting if only for that sake. But as for historical accuracy, not so much. This documentary only revisits the old myths of the battle; From the Aleutian attack being a diversion, to the failure of Tone's No. 4 scout being the reason the American fleet was not discovered in time. Other myths, including the Japanese Carrier decks being loaded with planes at the time of the 10:20am attack, Akagi being hit 3 times, the American fleet being grossly outnumbered in the battle, even the purpose of the battle (as a jump-off point to invade Hawaii), are included in this typically inaccurate rehash.I really hope that a new documentary would be produced with the these fallacies corrected once and for all. I wish I could have given this one a higher rating. What a shame."
5,GENTLE WAVES WITH GENTLE MUSIC,This is a wonderful album with my favorite nature sound of the Ocean. Suzanne Doucet's music blend's with the nature sounds in a gentle way - she takes you across the ocean with her music. This album is very relaxing but also uplifting.Highly recommended
1,Basically useless,"In theory this would be a practical tool for restoring a car's alignment after replacing a strut, but sadly it is not. First, while the magnet is strong enough to hold to a hub, there is essentially nothing to attach it to on most cars because a front wheel drive axle protrudes beyond the hub and the axle diameter is too small for the magnet to be solidly attached to. Second, there is a little wingnut that is supposed to ""lock"" your measurement in place, but anything stronger that a mild breeze will overcome the resistance provided and render your measurement useless, thereby rendering the whole purchase useless. My advice is just to use a carpenters level. It won't be accurate enough to skip the alignment shop, but it will be accurate enough to get you to the alignment shop."
2,Broken out of the box,"The wing nut for setting the alignment was stripped out of the box. The carriage bolt has odd thread pitch. I'll keep it to try, but will have to replace the nut and bolt before first use. Also, the magnet is not glued in place and pops out when attracted to metal.Shoddy construction! Poor quality control! Shame! Dishonor! Suicide!"
2,Professionsal alignment is necessary,If you are installing struts yourself....there is no way around it...it needs to be aligned by a shop with professional equipment to get it right. What you think you are saving in labor costs will be lost in buying tires very soon.
4,Scanmaker 5950 Review,"This is a good little scanner. I used it through grad school to convert research and books to pdf files so I could store them on my tablet PC and annotate them. The tablet weighed less than the several hundred thousand pages I had on it.It served its purpose well. It created pdfs pretty easily, it did a fair job at OCR (even in French), and generally, I think it was worth every penny.The down sides I think exist in the software. I bought adobe acrobat because I needed to do some manipulation with the files. The scanner and Acrobat allow me to do everything I want with it. Also, would it kill them to have an ancient Latin OCR dictionary?"
3,Cheap scanner that works OK,"Bottom line, it's a cheap scanner that gets the job done, if you are willing to play with it a little bit. It took me a while to figure out how to get it to do a simple task - scan multiple page documents into a single PDF file. The software makes this a bit difficult (you have to ""scan to email"" and then choose a medium-high dpi setting). The hardware is acceptable, for the $55.00 I paid for it on eBay. When I'm rich I'll buy a $1,000 document scanner, but until that time, I'm doing OK with scanners like this one."
4,Excellent value,"The feed is the key on these scanners-- that's what tends to break. I've owned HP's and Fujitsu scanners at much higher prices. HP held up a little longer--Fujitsu feed broke almost immediately. At half the price, this scanner is quite reliable- excllent value. I've scanned thousands of page and feed continues to work-- they even give you extra rubber rollers-- other scanners should copy that!"
2,Microtek Flatbed Scanners,"Please Note: I purchased a somewhat different model - 6100 Pro - over 1 year ago. I was unhappy with the purchase from the onset and have subsequently purchased a Canon 8400F ... a great scanner.The Microtek took very good scans from photos and film (35 mm slides). However, it rarely worked. It failed to recognize my computer and when I finally achieved a good scan it just stopped. Eventually, I convinced Microtek to replace the scanner however, the same problem recurred. I tossed the Microtek and bought a Canon.I could not recommend Microtek for a mid level flatbed scanner. In addition their customer technical service department is courteous, but they are almost impossible to contact.If you want a flatbed scanner in the $250 to $550 range you should look elsewhere."
2,Nice when it worked,"Worked well for about the first year, but now it will not communicate with my computer (all checks of hardware and software have failed me, of course)."
2,Not good,I am not pleased with the scanner. The software is very sensitive and I still haven't worked out all the details to function correctly. Do not buy...go spend few more dollars for somethign else.
5,GREAT KNOWLEDGE AND BUILDING I RESOURCE!,"This book combined with ,DO -IT -YOURSELF HOUSEBUILDING THE COMPLETE HANDBOOK by GEORGE NASH(AMAZON) , will absolutely allow a novice builder, to build a house of their dreams, and to understand all the concepts and techniques involved in the process."
5,Carpentry and Building Construction,Carpentry and Building Construction is a great educational book for a beginner or intermediate home builder or do-it-yourselfer. The book does very well at keeping your attention and helping you learn the material. Nothing can substitute for experience but this is a great book to get you started or refresh you memory.
1,Women's Leather Handbags,"I agree. Prada Women's Leather handbags are one of the best in the market. I think more than eBay, Amazon has a lot of varieties of handbags with great deals. I shop more online than going to the outlets as it saves me a lot of time in searching over the internet and getting delivered to my home. If you get a chance look at my blog on Women's Leather Handbags at[...]. You will love it too !"
5,Great Deal on the Prada Handbag!,"I love my Prada Handbag.I also liked the color. At first, I was not sure if I would like it.I also received the certificate of authencity which was very important for me to receive.I would recommend this handbag to my friends.Love it!!"
1,Customer service? (are they still in business?) TERRIBLE,"We purchased Model MM-1 last summer (07). Loved it until it broke this spring(08) under normal use. It came with a two year warranty. We contacted the company through phone (full mailbox) and email. Received an automated email response a month ago that ""issue will be resolved"". Have heard nothing since. Voicemail is still full and email contact no longer working...absolutely no satisfaction and no way to get in touch! I would stay away from this company even though I love their ""green"" aspect."
3,Had High Hopes,"The positive; 1) it cuts the lawn to a height of 0.4"" the lowest I have seen, 2) A great workout.The negatives; 1) price, 2) twigs stop the mower often enough to become a nuisance, 3) the wingnuts that came with the product for the handle sections or handlebars are useless. I used my own bolt and nuts. 4) you must cut the grass at least once a week during the growing season or it will be impossible to push, 5) Around thick roots on big trees it will not cut well, 6) Must pass at least 3 times to get all the grass blades in that section."
5,Soft and easy listening,"There were only a few songs that were fast paced, and those were just as good as the slow songs. If able try to find all the songs, or most of them anyway, so you know what you are getting. I personally had a youtube playlist of all but 3 of the songs on this album, so i knew what i was getting and was happy with the purchase, but if you have only heard the first song (Human Sacrifice)and you think they are all like that they aren't. They all seemed to be about love, which is fine with me, and i just highly recommend this CD if youve done research on the songs, wouldnt want anybody wasting there money and not liking the CD."
3,Average....not bad overall,"Because of her high pitched tone you may think jade is a weak vocal artist. But she can really hit the high notes.I admit i bought this cd for the cd cover but there is a mixture of bad and good songs.Human sacrifice is good for when your'e in a angry mood but its not strong enough to help your'e self.The worst song is probly ""alright"" as its weak and overrated.I reccomend this if you want to get a flavour of j pop music."
2,Wouldnt call these videos -( Essential rock or metal),These arent even big hits- some of them I never even heard of. Only 6 videos on the disc. If your looking for a particular video or enjoy the songs you should get this.Videos-Mr. Big- Addicted to that Rush from Mr. Big (1989)White Lion- Radar Love from Big Game (1989)- this song isnt badSavatage- Gutter Ballet from Gutter Ballet (1989) Interesting videoKings X- Over My Head from Gretchen goes to Nebraska (1989)Dio- All the fools sailed away from Dream Evil (1987)White Trash- Apple Pie from White Trash (1991)2.5 stars
4,A FIRST,"This was THE book that kicked off the ""New Perspective"" on Paul. Actually the book is mostly about Judaism. Sander's primary point is that Judaism was NOT a legalistic works-for-salvation religion. His principal axe to grind is with Ferdinand Weber and Emil Schurer, both of whom put out books on Judaism in the early 1900s or so.His treatment of Paul is scant but potent. He sees Paul arguing that ritual works of the law (circumcision and food laws) must not be foisted on Gentile Christians -and NOT arguing that salvation is by faith and not works.In truth this book is really rather dry - and the average theology student will get more out of reading N.T. Wright or James D.G. Dunn, who discuss Sanders extensively, critiquing and fleshing out his positions.But if you are a Pauline student you may simply want a copy on yout shelf!"
5,Good Overview,This book is essentially a reference by common name for edible and medicinal plants of the west. The conversational writing style and convenient size guarantee this book will go with you.
4,Edible ... plants ...,"Very handy book. Small and handy. I keep it in my ""emergency"" kit and frequently refer to it for edible plants just for experimentation. I would recommend it to anyone."
4,"not a bad ""how-to"" tarot book for beginners","Step-By-Step Tarot offers the general explanation of card meanings in the author's point of views and in the ""figure's."" (e.g. I am the Magician. I am the person who...) What I like most are the 26 tarot reading guidelines which tell you an appropriate attitude or performance a tarot reader should have. The author explains to you not only the meanings of tarot cards but how to solve the conflicts if they are parts of the definition of cards. This book is for those who have no idea about what Tarot is but want to learn it. I do not think it is a best choice for experienced readers because there are only three or four spreads in this book. Also, as an experienced reader, you might not want to read so much information of card meanings which occupy the most part in this book."
2,not much to learn from this book,"The author was rather lazy in writing this book. He asked the ""Masters"" the same questions. You cannot ask the same question to people have different trading styles. The question of which futures should be retained or cancelled is really stupid. It doesn't help traders to learn something useful. Some of the ""Masters"" didn't answer all of them. And some answers were very confusing. I would prefer Schwager's Market wizards. This book is also overpriced. Fortunately, I borrowed it from the library. Not recommended!"
2,Don't expect too much from it.,"If you are a beginner, it is a book for your starting. Many basic trading system concept are introduced. But you will find the concepts introduced are very superficial and hard to find any mysterious secret system in the book."
4,Looks very retro but plastic cheapens the display,The Cake stand folks sent very fast! The cake stand itself looks very polished and sturdy. The Cake display portion of the stand the plastic dome cheapens the the quality of the unit. Overall not bad could be better! Seller was very courteous and shipped very fast and responded well on shipping.
4,This was a good solid book.,I really enjoyed this book although I felt a bit bored during certain parts of it. I loved Lucien's character in Nothing but Velvet and maybe I was just hoping his book would be better. Don't get me wrong it was a great book but I just wanted a little more.
3,cute moments,"I've read a few of Kat Martin's books and they tend to be a smooth read every time. This one was a little to overdone for my liking. The hero, Lucien, was really shallow. All he seemed to want from Katherine was sex. I know what your thinking, that comes with a romance novel, but you couldn't get through a chapter without him WANTING her!! It was too much. Katherine was ok, she also had her shallow moments, but all in all, the book had some great moments and was still worth reading. It's just not one I would put in my top ten list."
3,Decent,"Uncharacteristically bland offering by Swedish metal band. Overall, not up to the level of quality established with previous efforts. Still, an o.k. album that retains at times the same exotic feel of other albums they put out. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but die hard fans of the group. Key tracks are I'll Cry For You and the title track. Favorable comparisons to Black Sabbath, Stryper and Led Zepppelin."
3,Heavy metal was no longer their desire...,"Europe kicked off the career excellent with the releases of ""Europe"" and ""Wings of tomorrow"", just to slowly run out of fuel along the road from heavy metal to pop-metal. ""Prisoners in paradise"" is the last effort from the band that was inspired by UFO and Thin Lizzy, but ended up being musical pals with Warrant and Def Leppard. The music on this album feels very time typical and enough time haven't passed yet for any nostalgic value. I must admit that some songs are rather good and if you choose to listen to one or two songs at a time you'll find this album to be much better than if you play the whole disc at once. Small doses might do the trick!"
5,cd was in mint cond. brand new,cd arrived in mint condition and was brand new just like it was described. I played right away and it sounded awesome!!!!!
2,Very Disappointing Release,"I have never cared for this album from Europe. If you're expecting an album in the style of The Final Countdown, don't look here. I still wish that I hadn't bothered buying this CD a few years ago. Joey Tempest's vocal style is nothing like it was on past albums. That's disappointing since he had a great vocal style. The songs on this album are in a rougher vein and just don't shine. The only songs that are okay are ""Girl From Lebanon"" and ""Prisoners in Paradise."" Skip this album and listen to The Final Countdown."
1,Wired is a hunk of garbage.,"This is the kind of movie where after watching it, you want to demand your two hours back. For those of you who don't feel like wasting your time, here's a summary of the film: John Belushi dies of a drug overdose and then magically wakes up right before his autopsy. With the help of his sidekick guardian angel named (get this..)ANGEL, he re-lives points in his wild life, eventually realizing the error of his ways. Sound like a Charles Dickens story? Almost. The only difference is, he never comes back to life. Don't waste your money on this horrible excuse for a film. If you want to see how crazy John Belushi's life was, read the book the movie was based on (also titled Wired) or just watch one or two episodes from the early days of SNL. This movie covers absolutely NO new ground regarding Belushi's life."
2,The only thing that killed this movie was the fiction,"Everything for this movie was perfect: Chiklis did a great impression of Belushi, so did the gut playing Akyroyd. Perfect, even some of the scenes were accurate like the book, ""Wired""But you know what REALLY baffeled me? The fact that they had to make this movie as the GHOST of Belushi looking back on his life is what made this movie a tragedy!! I had absolutely no idea that this would not be a fictional story of Belushi.Like the reviewer from Connecticut said, ""It seems like a Dickens story trying to give Belushi a chance...but he never gets it!""If they would have just made this film STRICTLY like the book, without the fictional stuff, then it would have been great! If there is an afterlife, I sure hope that Belushi doesn't know about this film."
3,Not as pictured,"Very nice quality, good value, but colour is brown; not gray, nor black, as photographed. Slightly larger than seed pearls."
2,Heavy Use of Evolutionary Theory,"This book is extremely well done and educational. It is not, however, for anyone who does not favor macro-evolution (i.e. darwin's theory) or the ""Big Bang"" theory. The book focuses heavily on these things. Those who believe in ""Creationism"" - God created the world and all living things - should probably steer clear of this one."
2,WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Following the reviews on this site, I purchased this book for my 10 year old. She has not taken to it very much and finds it ""confusing"" ""busy"" and ""unclear"". It is a very quirky book with tons of graphics and all forms of letter fonts. It is far from straight forward."
5,Earthsearch is a wonderful book for a childs mind.,"I have the book EarthSearch,by John Cassidy. I think this book is a wonderful rescource for a childs project and mind. It teaches history and geography all in one book. I have this book and will treasure it always. I reconmend this book to anyone who is interested in the earth, your health,and what the human body is made of,(history too).Rebecca J. Cox"
5,"This may be a kids book, but the ""facination level"" is a 100","I honestly intended to buy this book for my 7 year old granddaughter, but I've had it a week, and find new facts of amazement each time. I took your advise a & did not read it cover to cover, but just roamed around till something caought my eye. Now I have to buy it for ALL the grandkids."
4,Mirror replacement,The mirror was an exact fit for my truck. You cannot tell that the replacement mirror was not original to my truck.
2,Limited scope,"Although the atlas is good for as far as it goes, it doesn't cover the whole of Jerusalem. I was looking for broader coverage, with maps extending at least as far west as Maale Adummim and Abu Dis. But these maps do not cover that area. Nor do they cover Giv'at Ze'ev to the north-west. I would have expected more."
3,Cover your gray,It's more like mascara. I need something with a bigger brush. I tried it and I don't really like it.
4,Cover Your Gray Touch up Brush in Color - Black,"Does the thing for the money but doesn't stay too long.When out, you need to reapply after few hours. Definitely have to wash your hair within the next few days."
5,Brazilian Amazon Wrinkle Cream Wonder!,"Leave all your other creams behind, no matter what brand or price! This cream quickly and visibly reduces wrinkles, scars, acne marks, chicken pox marks, and other chronic or difficult skin issues. Chicken pox dimples I've had for over 7 years have now all but disappeared. This is a very rich cream, so it is best used at night since make-up cannot be applied over top. Excellent for crows feet (but do NOT get to close to your eyes). Its unsurpassed antioxidant content, plus its ability to deal with longterm skin problems makes this an invaluable addition to your skincare routine."
4,Excellent reference and coffeetable book,"I was interested in purchasing a vintage Vespa scooter, and this book is helpful in knowing the history of the company, its representative Vespa models from 1940's to recent 2005 models. It is not an exhaustive listing of every model the company ever produced. Nevertheless it gives a pretty good background of what one is looking at. Every page of this book has color and/or black/white photogrpahs, and some are shot in closeup views. If you're considering buying a vintage Vespa, I would recommend this reference book."
3,Solid stylish watch that does not live up to Expectations,"This watch looks good, but it has a couple of big issues. One is that you have to zero all the hands so the time is correct. That would not be a problem if it stayed that way, but somehow the watch has twice in three months set the date back by one day. The second hand has also gotten off by a little, so even though you are synched to the atomic clock you have the wrong time and date. Other quibbles are smaller, like not always being able to get an atomic signal, the alarm only sounding for 10 seconds, and the dual time is too easy to change."
3,Good dependable Casio,Generally very happy with this watch. Initially I had a bit of difficulty getting it set to receive time signals. But after a few days it self corrected and all has been well since.
3,solid perspective on an earlier crisis,"This book is about the crisis of the 1980s in Central America, at the height of the Cold War-style conflict as it was run by the Reagan Administration. Leikin in my reading is a moderate and centrist scholar, and he does a superb job as editor of this volume. His voice argued for balance and was not overly ideological. While this is almost ancient history now, this conflict offers many lessons about the current administration and its policies in Irak.Recommended. This stuff is still worth knowing."
4,"Lyrics available online, mostly","I chose this one because it seemed made for French speakers, not simplified. The words are quite clear, and the variety of instrumentation appealed immediately to my four-year-old granddaughter. For her mother, I found the French texts online, furnished by volunteers and mostly accurate--just google the singer's name. Translations are another matter. Too bad the publishers can't provide texts or translations.We did dance to ""Sur le pont"" (you just go round and then bow or salute following the words), but wouldn't it be nice to have dance suggestions for all of these--that's what granddaughter asked for. Get to work, Grandma!I sampled many of Amazon's French-songs-for-children CDs before buying. I also liked another one, a jazz version of these children's songs. It was appealing, and the songs were extremely well sung, but so remote from the traditional rhythms as to be almost unrecognizable.I am very pleased with my choice of this classic version."
5,Love this CD,"I bought this while my daughter was taking French immersion classes. We both love the songs--very fun and catchy tunes. Even if you don't understand French, you can't help but to love the energy, drama, and playfulness of the songs."
1,"defective CD - the voice quality is terrible, waste of money",i do not recommend buying this CD as the voice quality is so bad it is totally useless. Not happy with it.
4,My kids loved this,"My kids really liked this CD. It was a car-trip favorite. We adults got a little tired of some of the songs, but that shouldn't be a deterrant."
1,Bad quality CDs,I've ordered this CD twice now. In each case the CD was defective and unplayable. It's cheap for a reason!
1,Almost COMPLETELY Unbearable,"Maybe it's because I am a classical musician - but hearing awful accompaniment, some people a bit off-key (BAD for kids' brains to get used to!!), or the REALLY ANNOYING SOUND EFFECTS!! AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!! I don't know what it is - but I can't stand this thing. I shall listen enough times to learn the notes - I found the lyrics on the Internet - and I will sing them to my granddaughter myself. I don't want her hearing this terrible thing. Ugh!It all makes me want to drive an awl into my ear. Okay, maybe not. But seriously - can't we do better?! We've been to the moon, for pete's sake!I'm sorry - it seems I cannot post the link to the lyrics, but you can search the Internet and find them."
3,one little problem,"The only problem with this CD is that it does not include either a printed version of the French lyrics, or an English translation of the lyrics. Other similar CDs I've purchased include both."
5,Perfect for re-freshing forgotten French,I used to be fluent in French 25 years ago and I'm now trying to bring it back from the depths of my brain in order to teach it to my pre-schooler.This CD is soooo pleasant to listen to that I can't get enough of it. We listen to it in the car and while I'm working at the computer. The songs are so cheerful and catchy that you just have to sing along! I highly recommend it!
4,good practice,"I got this CD for my small nieces. They don't speak French, but they've been introduced to Spanish and German. Still, they enjoy this CD and can tell it's for other little people their age. It's important for kids to hear different sounds when they're young enough to be able to make them--and could ostensibly help them years later if they decide to study French as teens or adults."
5,Songs likely to entertain anybody,"The songs are sung by adult singers, not a children's choir, and the voices are beautiful. That's why I can use the CD for beginning learners of French in a college classroom.The songs are not just sung, one after the other. They are also a little bit acted out, with the interjection of voices and animal sounds that can be funny, instead of embarassing, to young adults. The CD is not just kids singing children's songs. It has more surprises, is more playful, a bit funny, so that kids and adults can enjoy it.Good selection of songs. Nothing primitive or basic about it."
3,Fun songs but no words,"We have fun singing these songs, but there is no insert with the words so we're a little lost."
3,"As described, but not as useful as anticipated.","The spice rack came in a timely manner and in good condition. If I had been paying closer attention to the dimensions and had been able to see this rack in person, I would not have purchased it. It is very small and doesn't hold nearly as many spice bottles as I had hoped. The price and shipping were much higher then the quality (although good) and dimensions warrant. If you want something fairly sturdy and small this is for you, but if you want something to hold your massive collection of fun spices, look elsewhere."
4,THE STORY TELLER,"I REALLY ENJOYED THE VIDEO. ESPECIALLY REV. B. CONE, HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST STORY TELLERS OF OUR TIME. HE'S RIGHT UP THERE WITH DORTHY NORWOOD AND SHIRLEY CEASAR. I LOVE THE TRADITIONAL CHOIR EFFECT OF THE CHOIR THEY'RE NEVER DIS-APPOINTING. WE SHOULD NEVER LOSE THIS CHOIR AND THE LIKE."
3,Buy brands you know!,"The Danesco pepper mill seemed to be a worthwhile product, but on using it I found it to be undependable. The fact that you can vary the grind from fine to course is great, but as you use it, the swith jumps from fine to course, so what's the point?"
5,Fun gift,"Make sure you give this to someone with a sense of humor, but it is a great gift if not taken seriously. If someone is expecting working voodoo here, this isn't intended for that purpose. It's just a comical way to say you understand when someone else is frustrated in the work place."
5,Perfect gift for coworkers,I bought several of these to give as small but fun gifts for coworkers during the holidays. They all REALLY enjoyed them.
5,Volume I of 2 volume set,This book is volume I of a 2 volume set. Click link for volume II (ISBN 9781581124125)Principles & Practice of Urology: A Comprehensive Text (v. 2).
1,Only got Volume I of II.,I am very disappointed. I can't find any way on the Amazon site to complain about this or remedy it. So now what do I do? I'm not at all happy.
1,Long tern use of item,"While the spray pattern is nice and the ability to adjust the head to your desired position is very nice. Customer's are in for a rude awakining after six months. The washers break down and Delta DOES NOT cover them in the LIFETIME warranty. However you can buy them at ACE Hardware (kit #PO8-2470K) for 2.49 plus tax. Make sure that you get two kits, one for the upper portion and the other for the lower. Other than that I like it. :("
4,Delta Shower Head,"So far a decent product. The water pressure isn't the best, but the increased shower head size partially compensates. It is a good shower head for the price. The jury is still out for the long term."
3,"Cold, austere","I purchased this in order to see how these most beautiful of pieces would sound in SACD. The sound is excellent, although to me there a bit too much of what sounds like echo, which may be the result of the room in which the recording was made. (The label justifiably prides itself in the purity of its recording process).My problem is with the performances, which while technically outstanding, to me come off as cold, austere. They lack the melancholy and deep passion that are the essence of the pieces. They sound like prose instead of the poetry they are, a particular problem for Opus 119. There are some unusual tempi too, like in Opus 116, No. 5, which has a strange retard that comes off sound like a hobby-horse.Those who love Ms. Leonskaja may well love this disc, but I didn't and really wanted to."
2,Disappointing,There were only a good ten to twelve chapters of this book that was good. The rest was not good what-so-ever. I skipped about twenty chapters and was still able to follow the story. I personally didn't like the book but someone else may enjoy it.
4,Aussie romance in Arabia,"Stolen by the Sheikh is Trish Morey's 3rd romance novel. When a tall, dark and handsome man walks into Sapphy Clemenger's fashion boutique in Milan, she's immediately attracted. But the man she knows as Khaled wants her to design a wedding dress for his bride-to-be. And he insists she come to his home city in the small independent desert state, Jebbai, to design and make the dress. Sheikh Khaled Al-Ateeq has very personal reasons for virtually kidnapping Sapphy, and the dress is just a pretext. At first I thought this romance was going to be all swooning at his powerful masculinity, etc, but actually, the dialogue proved to be quite snappy and the plot was better than I had expected. An Aussie romance located in the Arabian desert."
3,A fun but light read,"Sapphire is a woman on the rise. She's smart, sexy and loves her career. She doesn't stand a chance when she unwittingly makes it to the top of this passionate and powerful shiekhs list of things to do.There are two reasons I didn't give this story more stars. The first is because the length of the novel didn't allow for more full character developments. The second is because I felt cheated that none of the 'bad guys' were really bad guys.Overall, I enjoyed the lighthearted flight into a fanciful and romantic world. This is a light read but still captivating through most of it."
2,A Lot of about Nothing,"Purely descriptive book written to get money from custommers. After I read it I still did not know how to play poker. A lot of unuseful information. For example, short chapter about holdem ends ""If you want to learn how to play holdem buy my next book""."
4,Light reading for the adventurous tourist,"This book, like the others in the series, is tongue in cheek. Some of the advice and scenarios are practical but others are completely in fun. My favourite was the advice of what to do if you are threatened with alien abduction. You should not let your mind give in to them. In other words, stop hallucinating and you will be just fine. :)At the same time some of the advice is practical and could be useful to everyone, not just travellers. For example it gives advice on what to do if your car ends up hanging over the edge of a cliff. While not an everyday occurrence it almost happened to a friend of mine during a snowstorm on the highway."
5,Seriously Funny,"The Worst Case Scenario books are really great conversation pieces. You'll receive tongue-in-cheek education on such topics as ""How to Ram a Gate"" and how to say, ""Hello, I am seriously injured. May I borrow towels to mop up the blood?"" in five languages. The instructions are clearly written and illustrated, and it will give you a chuckle to imagine yourself in these scenarios. However, if you ever find yourself needing to bribe a customs official, just whip out this handy guide!"
3,Not up to past standards,"The ""Worst Case Scenario"" people are really scraping the bottom of the barrel. Surviving an airplane crash and building a snow shelter can be important! But encountering aliens, while offering both an extreme scenario and a touch of humor, isn't specifically travel-related. The same with a plummeting elevator, or losing someone who's tailing you. On the other hand, they've omitted some important items, like getting arrested in a foreign country, or losing your passport. This series is losing steam."
2,Fairly stupid book,"This is the first of the Survival series I've read and will be the last. I just don't get it. The scenarios in this book are either absurd (alien abductions) or simply remote and therefore not useful. And the solutions are not particularly accurate or helpful in some cases. For instance, ""How to Crash-land a Plane on Water"" says ""...remove the pilot from the pilot's seat."" Just that one step will be very difficult to do with an unconscious person in a small airplane, and many of the remaining instructions are equally trivialized or irrelevant.Maybe some of the scenarios and instructions are supposed to be funny, but the book was neither humorous or informative. I wouldn't recommended it as a free gift."
3,Not really enough to bet your life on but fun to read,"I bought this book mainly because I also have the authors first book The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook. Both books are fun to read and in a desparate situation they might help you save yourself but as they say, Don't try this yourself. There isn't really enough information on any of the subjects to really do safety training justice ( a whole book would be needed for each one to do that)so buy it in the spirit of curiosity with a touch of education. If you're on a limited book budget stick with their first book."
3,Great library book,"This book was mildly entertaining at best. Of the forty-four scenarios, only a couple are immediately useful to most people. I did find the trivia type Be Aware sections informative. Unfortunately the How to Foil a UFO Abduction section, while intended to be humorous, destroyed most credibility of this book. Am I reading a joke book or a book designed to save my life? Pick it up at the library or at a used bookstore for a couple of dollars."
1,Worst Case Scenario,"Sorry. No more than recylcled information, mostly from free Goverment materials. The Boy Scout Handbook does better."
5,New perspective,It's true...this book is for people who have a great sense of humor but also a serious mind. This book is packed with tips and detailed guides for just about any trouble you might slip into. Read it for kicks or to save you [behind]. Either way it's one of the most entertaining books you'll ever read.
1,Worst-Case Scenario: Survival Handbook,"Not what I was expecting. The survival techniques were in most cases so far out of reach, and often out of date as well. There was no humor and little of use for most travelers."
4,takes itself seriously,"The his credit, the author of this book takes the subject very seriously, although I suspect that his readers may not. I picked up the book as a ""light"" read and found myself surprised at how even the most unlikely scenarios were treated: like they could actually happen!"
3,Fun read.,I bought this to kill some time reading on a short flight. I don't know if all of the tips in the book are really workable but it was fun to read and at least one or two could come in handy. Hopefully I won't need to bribe a third world government official and I am not likely to be trapped on a runaway camel but if I do I will have some idea how to do it.If you are looking for a book you can finish on a 45 minute flight and get a chuckle as you read and imagine yourself in the situations that the book describes-- this is your book.But if you are looking for real world survival tips that are technical and detailed enough to actually use you need a different book and you will need to practice most of the tips. (you probably won't be able to land a small plane in the water and survive by reading over this book once or twice...)Have fun with it.
5,Very amusing read,This book has some hilarious situations / illustrations that make it an easy read for a flight. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a small gift to buy a friend with plans to travel.
3,Funny but will not save your life,"This series is good for some laughs, but is very likely to get you killed. The best on the topic is the US Army Survival Manual."
1,Not the product advertised,Agree with other 1 star review. Not the product that you ordered. Beware. Just pay extra and get it from a legitimate seller.
5,love it!,I bought one set and loved it so much I bought a second set. I have owed them for a little over a year and am still very pleased with the product. The have a nice weight and and look great.
5,Beautiful flatware,This style of flatware is very attractive. I like the alternative flat and glossy sheen on the handles. Very elegant! They have a nice weight and wash up well. I haven't had a problem with spotting.
2,Not What I Hoped For,"Saw this and thought I was buying a ""Henckels"" quality flatware set and am disappointed. The items are thinner and ""cheaper"" feeling than I expected from a company by the name of Henckels. Over the years I loved their excellent knives but this set is just adequate and not up to expectations."
4,JA Henckels Stainless,"I have several sets of Sterling flatware...one for each daughter. I came across a Wallace Grand Bororch set from 1947...my youngest was using plastic because she was afraid of ""dead peoples"" stuff. So I melted the awesome set and got $3,100 then bought your stainless set for $70.00. This set was a bit lighter weight than I expected but it is actually 18/10 and one shouldn't buy anything less. This stuff is strong durrable and I'm proud to replace my $3,100 vintage set with non-dead people flatware. Good value, delivered as promised and handles the dishwasher just fine. For those of you with the negitive feedback-you scared me before I pressed order...then I realized you don't have a clue."
3,Got Rusty!,"This is my second review of this product as I had to edit the previous one. At first I gave the product 5 stars! It has a nice design, and is pretty strong (does not bend easily). But now I can also see some rust as a few other people do which is extremely disappointing! The outer coating on one of the knives and a large serving fork got (or was) chopped off (about 1x1 mm area) and now that area got rusty:("
5,great silverware!,i had these on my wedding registry even though i had never seen them up front. they are not heavy...but not light either. they are pretty sturdy and have gone through the dishwasher a couple of times and no scratches. the back of all of the silverware is plain...no details just silver. the detail is really nice and looks great with our china and i'm very happy with the set!
4,Stylish Flatware for Everyday or Special Occasion Use,"Gave 4 stars instead of 5 because was expecting the flatware to have a little more weight. Classic, elegant design - two sided pattern - brushed and polished. Overall, a good price (~$55 a set before 4-for-3 promotion). Missed out on theJ.A. Henckels 45pc Bellasera Flatware Setdeal so jumped on this instead. This ended up being better priced. You can find this at Macy's [...]) and check it out yourself before you buy."
3,Good But Not Great,"Nice set, looks good... Not as thick and heavy as I thought they would be. They work well, and I am happy I purchased them... I was just expecting something more substantial by this name and at this price point."
3,Only Average Quality Stainless Steel,"I purchased this product because it is supposed to be made of 18/10 stainless steel, which is supposed to be extremely resistant to rusting and the normal acids found in food.However, the Recommeded Care Instructions included rinsing the flatware after coming in contact with any acidic foods such as mustard, ketchup, lemon, ectc, before putting them in the dishwasher. The instructons also recommended using a drying cycle in the dishwasher, becuase the flatware may rust if one is not used. And a metal polish is recommended if spotting, or rust does occur.The truth is that China has never mastered the stainless steel manufacturing process and all such products are inferior to what used to be manufactured in the United States. Fifty years ago, my Dad came home with a set of 18/8 stainless steel flatware that his company, Armco, was making for Oneida. They used that flatware for more than thirty years without it spotting, or rusting."
1,Disappointing,I was very disappointed with this silverware. I thought because it was Henkels and it was 18/10 it would be good silverware but it wasn't. It was very easy to bend. I have bought Oneida 18/10 and it it almost impossible to bend. Not sure how they arrived at their 18/10 but it is definitely not that strong. I am sending it back tomorrow.
1,Definitely Not Stainless,"Had this set for about one year. It has become totally ""caked over"". I did not know that you could stain ""stainless steel."" I am very disappointed. While it is labeled 18/10, this is a Made in China product. So quality control is an issue. The difficulty with made in China is that the first lots of goods are made according to specifications. However, quality creep sets in fairly rapidly. 18/10 becomes 17.95/9.95 and then 17.75 / 9.45 until you have junk. I really wanted a made in USA set to replace this one and have gone with an Oneida ""Dorchester"" set that is made in Indonesia."
4,"Hefty & Useful: Dishwasher ""Safe"" (carefully)","The Henckels flatware set is seriously hefty compared to our old set: they have heavy handles. They are nice to look at, the handles are easy to grip and the knife is actually sharp.We've used them about a 45 days and put them through the dishwasher (normal wash, heat dry, Finish powerball tablet detergent). One of the teaspoons did end up with a ""rust"" spot due to overcrowding the utensil container. It never happened again once I realized this. FYI: the care instructions for the set states not to use chlorinated dishwasher detergent on the flatware.To clean the rusty spot, I use Barkeepers Friend and it removed most of the stain. Only a faint outline remains. It works well on cleaning all stainless steel products (follow instructions on container).My only comment is that the handle-heavy set makes it easy to fumble if you don't have a good grip on it. This is especially true with the knives."
2,"Lightweight, feels cheap!","The first thing I want to emphasize is that it IS LIGHTWEIGHT! So much so, your first impression when picking it up is that it is cheap, despite the pretty look. The knife is the only piece that feels even close to right. The second thing that bothered me is the soup spoon, which is huge in comparison to the short handle. It was odd looking. It is 18/10 but so light they chintzed out on material."
3,Fact hound?,"An awesome collection of facts, charts, ideas, and stuff about work and home life. Need to know the specific gravity of ammonia? Want to know how to lay concrete in extreme conditions? Looking for first aid solutions? This is a cool book."
5,The Young Unicorns,"I've been reading this book over and over again since I was in my teens. It's always relevant, and I cannont recommend it, or any other book by Ms. Lengle highly enough. the strugle between good and evil takes place in the highest levels of Church authorities, and the ending, while a bit predictable, still comes about as a surprise. the new characters are wonderfully written, and you care about them almost as much as the Austins you already know, right away.if you have a teenager, this book shouldn't be missed, by either of you. there's a lot to talk about."
1,This book is awful!!!!!!!!!!!,"Don't read The Young Unicorns!!! It is a huge dissapointment!!! Instead of being about Vicky Austin growing up, it is about sci fi rays and manipulated minds. The Young Unicorns barely talks about Vicky at all! It also is a little hard to understand because of all of the technology. There is hardly any background information given about the Austins in New York. If you have read Meet the Austins and The Moon by Night and are expecting the same kind of book in The Young Unicorns, you'll be really dissapointed. I definently was."
3,Stopped working after one year,"I got this as a gift for my wedding a year ago. It worked excellently for a year, then one day, I went to turn it on and NOTHING - not even an attempt at lighting up or working in any way. So it just stopped working for no reason. It was too bad because when it worked, it made great waffles, and it was nice to be able to make two at a time, so my husband and I could both eat, instead of waiting for another one to cook up before sitting down together."
3,"works well, small","Worked well, too small for a family... you'd be cooking waffles all day at two at a time!"
2,"Definitely NOT ""easyclean""","I'm not sure where I got mine, but I enjoyed the waffles it made. They were golden and crispy. Upon use, batter leaked out and I didn't think anything about it. However, when it was time to clean up, I discovered that the plates were not removable, the batter had caked to the outside, and the entire unit was just generally impossible to clean well."
1,Don't waste your money on this brand.,"Don't waste your money on this brand. Spend a few extra dollars and buy a model with removable griddles. Toastmaster waffle irons are hard to clean. If you put in too much batter or the iron overflows on the side, you'll have a long project ahead of you to clean it. Chunks of batter get stuck inside the iron and you may find yourself taking the whole thing apart to attempt to clean it. I put my Toastmaster waffle iron where it belongs - in the garbage - and bought a much better model from a different manufacturer."
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"I bought this in Feb 2005 for $7.50 at Target, and the lights went out 6 months later. The whole thing died today. It made good waffles while it lasted, but I'm used to appliances lasting several years, not 10 months."
3,Waffle Maker,I bought this as a replacement for my old one. I am not to pleased with it. Takes longer to cook the waffle and doesn't brown crisp enough for my tastes. I am currently looking for another brand to replace this one.
1,Don't waste your money,What a disappointment. The waffles did not brown evenly and parts did not brown at all. Even my three year old was turned off by the look of the finished waffle. Now that's bad. The directions state the the green light goes on and off during cooking so you really don't know when its done.I did use a recipe for waffles and did not have sticking problems that was my only plus.
2,heavy waffles,"I bought this to replace an older model which worked well for ten years. I was shocked to find that the cooking surface area had been reduced by 74% !! This was done by reducing the size of the teeth from approx. 10 mm x 10 mm to 6 mm x 6 mm. This results in slower cooking (it took 10 minutes to get one set of two baked ... it used to take 3 min) ) and a heavier, less enjoyable waffle. I expect the mfgr saved a lot in reduced material costs. I feel like the victim of a ""gotcha""."
4,from theory to practice,"As a 14-15 year old senior league baseball coach I have found Mr. Lau's techniques for hitting extremely useful. What was most helpful from the video was Lau's focus on a good weight shift, which makes it possible for a lightweight hitter to make strong contact with the ball. I found his talk about lead arm extension useful as well--not only does it allow for a complete follow-through, but stresses the importance of keeping your head ""down on the ball"". I would recommend this video to anyone interested in improving their swing through the use of sound mechanics."
4,Almost Great Basic Hitting Video,"While Charlie Lau was one of the most renowned hitting coaches, he comes across in this video at times as a comically grumpy old man. The portion of the video where he is demonstrating his fundamental approach to hitting is invaluable (even though it is obviously not rehearsed or scripted, and, therefore, could be more focused). The portion where he answers questions from the players is not as strong as he sometimes mumbles dismissive answers. The final portion is not instructional, he merely gives his opinion of the players he considers to be the best hitters of all time. Still, this is a very good video, especially if you watch it in conjunction with the one made by his star pupil, George Brett. Brett's video by itself is filled with fluff and not really very useful but it does show proper execution of the lessons in Lau's video."
2,More about what is wrong than what is right,"Rising to the Call is about finding the call that God has for your life. Author Os Guiness states that only when we are connected with our creator are we able to truly find our ""call"".I wasn't overly impressed with this book. Most of the book talks about what is wrong with the other techniques used for finding your meaning in life. This really doesn't do anything for the reader who is actually trying to find their call.I also wasn't impressed with the writing style as it doesn't do a good job of breaking down complex topics. You probably are best not picking this one up.... pick up ""What Color Is Your Parachute"" instead. 2 out of 5 stars."
4,Amazing watch,This watch looks amazingly beautiful. Wow! I had it delivered in 1 day. It was so quick. Impressed. This watch works perfect apart the date. There is some problem with it. It never shows the correct one even after had it set twice. I live outside of US so dont feel send it back to reclaim warranty. So i think i will wait a bit and try to repair this date settings in my country.
1,Defective Raymond weil watch,"I got the watch for my Christmas gift. The watch came in fast in one day as stated. But it does not move. Don't know if it is because of a dead battery or not. I will take it to a local Raymond Weil dealer today to check it out. Might have to return it. I buy staff from Amazon a lot (average a couple of times a month) and I have been very happy with all my past purchases. This is the first large investment I ever made through Amazon and it is quite disappointing to me. From now on, probably won't buy expensive (luxury) stuff from them anymore."
3,"It all ""ads"" Up","This installment of All-American Ads covers the dawn of the 20th century and the beginning of sophisticated selling. The book follows the same format used in previous volumes covering magazine advertising in each decade of the last century.The book documents the rise of branded national advertising. While some of the ideas are dated-- there are a number of current campaign and tag lines that had their genisus in this time period.National magazine and newspaper advertising would grow into a tremendously potent medium in the '20's and '30's (both covered well by other books in this series) but, if like me, you are fascinated by what our ancestors bought and how it was sold to them-- this book is a good place to see what got them into stores."
5,Loved It,"Having bought previous titles in this Taschen series, I was delighted to find that this particular volume is equally as spectacular. In fact, it's my favourite so far. I love viewing the past through the lens of popular advertising. Much is revealed of the hopes, wishes and concerns of the day. The graphics style of the ads is elegant, sometimes exotic and very colourful. Worth adding to your collection."
5,I LAUGHED MY ASS OFF,"This is one of those b-movies that are truely worth getting. The damn thing is so funny, I couldn't stop laughing. If you like TROMA movies, then you'll like this crazy flick. To be honest its 10 times better then a TROMA movie. So, order your copy today and laugh your ass off."
1,Don't believe the hype! This is total garbage!,"Dead Body Man is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Period. Bad acting, total lack of plot and endless torture of women (the director obviously has trouble with females), makes this a total mess and a waste of time. It's not funny, witty or remotely enjoyable and feels like a fetish film masquerading as horror. And what's up with that Freddy Krueger sweater guys? Cmon! If you like movies that have a budget of the price of the videotape it was filmed on or have a thing for ninth grade dialog and teen boy fantasies of rape and torture, than this is the movie for you. the content is not offensive but the execution of it is. Pure crap."
1,100 bucks worth of copies?,"I don't mind spending a 100 bucks on a book (on anything for that matter). Publishing this pile of copies in honor of racing engineer legend Carroll Smith is one thing, but asking 100 bucks for it...Apparently the Society of Automotive Engineers doesn't know that it takes more than a Xerox machine to publish a book. Due to the obvious xeroxing some of the text and a lot of the figures are just unreadable. It reminds me of the ""books"" I had to buy for college.I can only hope that the SAE will catch up with the advances made in the field of publishing and until then please buy something nice for your money."
4,El inicio de la leyenda,"Al fin pude escuchar este albúm que es una joya preciada para los amantes de este genero, mezcla de jazz, metal, tecno y que ha influenciado a grandes como Dream Theater. La calidad de la grabación no es buena, pero hay dos grandes cosas que vale la pena considerar, hay temas del Control que las canta Jason Mc Master, que en definitiva es mucho mejor vocalista que Alan, y hay dos temas inéditos de la banda. Estos demos los había escuchado en formato cassette, y nunca pensé que lo reditarían en CD, así que no pierdan la oportunidad de tener esta piedra fundacional del Metal Progresivo."
2,"A promising beginning, but...","The beginning of this book is promising- a young boy has repeated dreams of a huge wave which hovers over him, threatening to crash on him, but it never does. He also dreams of a peculiar but unidentifiable scent ""The Whiff"" sometimes in connection with The Wave, sometimes by itself. The description of his fright and obsession with these two dreams is written vividly and has a feeling of psychological realness. Unfortunately the rest of the novel doesn't live up to the first chapter- it's a meandering tale of romance and reincarnation which ends up in Egypt. Worth reading if you are a Blackwood fan who wants to carry away a few memorable images from the slog."
2,"Love the look, hate the broken glass","Received every style of the Cheers line as wedding gifts. We love the appearance of the glasses, but have broken about one every two weeks while washing by hand. The glass is too thin. If you want to buy the Cheers collection, I would recommend the double old-fashioned glasses, which are the short ones and are made of thicker glass. Again, they look cool, but it's not worth the pain of cut fingers and wasted purchases."
3,Amazon's picture needs to be updated,"Folks need to know that Mikasa has changed these glasses to have much thinner walls. The original product, which I own, have the thicker walls as shown in Amazon's picture but this isn't what you'll get if you order these. I've notified them of this discrepancy. 5 stars go to the original product but their *new* version only gets 3 stars."
1,Broken Glasses,Got 8 of these glasses for a wedding present a year ago and so far 3 have shattered. Two in the dishwasher and one in my hand. We also have the shorter glasses and none of those have broken so far so I would only recommend those but never these.
1,Glass is thinner ; no rounded lip,"Very thin, no rounded lip as shown in picture. used to be a great glass, no longer quality.Very disappointed. What happened Mikasa???"
4,Good Glasses,"My wife and I have had these glasses for many years now, starting with the first version and then as we added to the set they changed some of the patterns and I think they even have colored glass versions. Sure they are brittle, we have only lost three or four in 5 years of use. The only ones we have had the problem with is the high ball, all others have not broken but get a lot less use. We put these in the dishwasher, and cycle through the set every couple days. The only real problem is that in time the glass itself loses clarity. This took a long time, the ones that did are the ones in the set about 5 years old. Macy's always has these on sale for between 20 and 30 for a set of 4. Occasionally on a BOGO deal."
1,alright product,This review is all opinion.they are heavy and need to spread hand wide to grasp these and use.I bought the Luigi Bormioli set and prefier them.They make good gifts! :-)
3,"OK, not great","I thought I would include a review that is more recent than some. I have owned these glasses for about 4 months now. The glassware does have an edge that is sharper than any other glasses I own, and because of that I will not hand-wash them (even though it is ""recommended""). Having said that, I use them often and run them through the dishwasher probably 1-2 times a week, and they have not broken. I do wish they had a rolled edge, but they work so far (and I really enjoy the style and size)."
3,Made in France,"The newer ones aren't made in France. Even though these say they are, I would ask first. Some stores still have limited quantities of the old that are superior quality."
2,Beautiful but Very Fragile,"I bought the entire line of of these Mikasa glasses when I moved into my new home, a total of 24 glasses. Unfortunately, after only a few weeks, I'm down to 19 glasses after 5 were broken. The biggest culprit is ice. I've have gently ease ice into the glasses sliding them down slowly down the side. Very disappointing."
4,Great starter GPS,"This is a pretty cool product. Its small (no pointy antenna) and the software is very stable...limited but stable. One of the best features is the ""bread crumb"" where it just traces where you have been. Easy zoom features, easy on the battery, very intuitive. Accuracy is 11m (25m on altitude) so it is right up there with many other high priced stand-alone units."
1,Cheesy to say the least,"So thin you can see through them, not much use as a napkin. Poor quality for the money I guess"
5,always a favorite,"unfortunately this is one series that will probably never see its way to dvd and certainly not to bluray... but as long as these tapes are around i'll keep wearing out one set then buying it to watch and wear out all over again.. this is always going to be one of my favorite series, especially for the beautiful music... a fantastic show."
2,Not what I expected,"I love the Fantastischen Vier, but this one is entirely different. Not what I expected. Didn't realize it was a coproduction with an entirely differend band. Don't get it if what you're looking for is the Fantastischen Vier."
1,not as advertised,"they have substituted a cheap wood cup and stick for the wood fish, a castanet for one of the egg shakers, and a ""jingle tap"" (2 small tamborine chimes on a stick) instead of the spoons. I feel cheated, since it's too close to Xmas to exchange.Update: Amazon customer service tried to make this right by sending a replacement by next day air, unfortunately the replacement has the same problem, no wood fish. I can't fault Amazon for this, they are trying to at least change the description and have stopped selling it until they can verify the contents/description. Before buying elsewhere online, I suggest you confirm what's in the kit (if it matters to you)with the seller."
2,Music,"The 2 items my 2 yo plays with is the harmonica which seems high quality and the wooden fish. I suppose we could have purchased these items separately which may cost less. Quality is fine. For the money, I suppose it's a decent value to expose the kid to various instruments."
5,When Will The Complete DVD Series Come Out On DVD???,"I have been a Hardcore fan of Becker ever since it started. Dr. John Becker's Surliness, his ""Ranting & Raving"" at everyone around him. Becker reminds me of me when i complain about the little things in life. Now, to the DVD series themselves... The $64,000 Question all us hardcore Becker fans want to know is... When is the entire series coming out on DVD...??? Come on powers that be, make all us Becker fans's dreams come true...!!!"
1,Steer clear if you really want to learn to play,"I have seen these these harps in stores. I am a harp player. The quality on them is very inconsistant. There a few few lucky one that have gotten useable instruments, but for the most part the are decorative only. There are several good harps available from quality manufactures for just a bit more money. Look at Harpsicles, Dusty strings or if you are handy - Music Makers - they sell kits to build your own (you can also get pre-made) and are quality instruments. A lot of the enjoyment you get from playing is having an instrument that sounds good. If you are constantly have to struggle to keep it in tune - you won't play it. Do yourself a favor - steer clear."
2,Not worth the money,I just did not think this book had much substance to it at all. Several pages of stupid lists and a lot of photographs (which I personally wasn't impressed with). I am glad I bought a used copy and did not pay full price. I would have never purchased it if I had seen it beforehand. There was just nothing to it.
1,"Should have been titled ""How to raise a Misogynist Jerk""","As a father of boys and having had some experience as a boy myself, this book (a gift from a well meaning friend) was a special torture. I mean I don't think this guy said one thing right.The never ending rant about how misbehaving boys can do no wrong pauses just long enough to remind you that girls can do no good.A violent self righteous nut, raised by a violent self righteous nut, validating violent self righteous nuts by virtue of their cockroach like ability to persist.Keep these useless ideas away from your boys!"
1,A No-No,"I found this book totally unrelated to my experience of bringing up two sons, and far too rightwing in its reliance on fundamentalist ""Christian"" ideas of child-rearing.I have to wonder at the photos: viewing them on en masse makes me curious about Dobson's own sexuality, particularly considered in conjunction with his obsession with corporal punishment.This series of books, is in my opinion, a figleaf for abusers, giving them supposed ""Christian"" approval for hurting children. An emphatic non-recommendation. I'd've given it no stars whatsoever, but this is not an option on Amazon."
2,Not what I expected,"This is a cute book, but not what I expected. I was look for a book with parenting advice and this is more of a ""fun"" book."
3,Too few clips from the 1950s,"A very interesting DVD. However, for those that are fond of the earliest Chet Atkins, it is unfortunate that only five pieces from the 1950s have been included, - all the more so as many more clips from that period exist (Frankie & Johnny, Dark Eyes etc.). Maybe it's a matter of copyright, or the non-included videos are too well-known."
5,Chet Atkins Performances,"The Chat Atkins Rare Performances 1955 - 1975 were just wonderful. I have seen Chet Atking,Boots Randolph and Floyd Creamer in concert several times. Theywere a great team. Chet Atkins could capture an audience with his smooth performance and clear playing ability. His style and presence was rare indeed.This is a must to buy if you like guitar!"
1,"Cute glasses, BUT way too thin of glass!","Beware of these thin-walled glasses! Wow, so we ordered these glasses because they were so cute and Mikasa should have great quality right?! Wrong, well, they are very cute, but are the worst glasses we have ever owned. They are so paper thin at the tops that they chip and crack with the slightest touch. You have to hand wash them, but beware of this too because they easily chip and break while doing so! I cannot honestly believe that Mikasa made such a horrible product, they should be embarrassed and recall them all! DO NOT buy these glasses, you will be wasting a ton of money and will just be throwing them away soon after from chipping anyway. Mikasa.com says that they guarantee their glasses for life, by the way, BUT, you must buy them directly from them (I wish I would have done my research on these before buying)."
1,Fragile,"Fragile and inadquate packing to protect. I like the glasses and the pattern but they are fragile. So fragile that they cannot be shipped to me unbroken. My original order received with a broken glass, Amazon sent a replacement very quickly, again received with a broken glass. Amazingly it was the same pattern that broke again in shipping. So I was unhappy because I wanted that pattern to complete the set. Again I contacted Amazon and they would not send a second replacement and my only option was to get a refund and then go back and reorder online. But guess what? The price has increased $5 in the three weeks, phooey. Guess I will not have that pattern in my set of glasses. I have that pattern in other sets but have to do without in double old fashioned glasses.This is the first time I have been dissatisfied with my dealings with Amazon and I have purchased quite a bit. Not my fault, not their fault but they decided not to try a third time, so I'm dissatisfied."
1,Heavy,too heavy in coparison to other brands.This review is all opinion.they are heavy and need to spread hand wide to grasp these and use.I bought the Luigi Bormioli set and prefier them.They make good gifts! :-)
3,Thinner than our sets from 2006,"These glasses feel lighter, with thinner walls than the sets we bought in 2006. I do not know if this is intended as an improvement or a cost-saving measure. We haven't used them enough to know if they are unreasonably fragile as other reviewers have noted. We use them daily for juice, etc. so I would prefer to have the ""old reliable"" heavy version."
5,UN BEST HITS CON 38 TEMAS,"RESPETANDO OPINIONES GUSTOS Y DEMAS,ESTE DISCO TIENE CASI TODA LA OBRA DE SUMO.QUEDAN PARA AQUELLOS FANATICOS LOS DISCOS ""CORPINOS EN LA MADRUGADA"" Y ""FIEBRE"".EN MI OPINION NADA MEJOR QUE ENCONTRAR EN UN SOLO CD 3,TIENE CASI TODO LO QUE UNO PUEDE ESCUCHAR DE SUMO.DIFIERO EN OPINION CON EL REVIEW ANTERIOR PUESTO QUE YO NO ME ANIMARIA A DECIR QUE UNA BANDA TENGA TEMAS RESCATABLES O NO ,SOLO ME LIMITO A DECIR QUE ME GUSTA O NO.EN CUANTO A SUMO SIN SER FAN ME ARRIESGO A DECIR QUE FUE UNA DE LAS BANDAS MAS ORIGINALES QUE HE ESCUCHADO."
2,I was okay until....,"....this one section where the heroine falls asleep during sex while the hero is climaxing. Seriously? I understand that the author was trying to show that Emily found sex with him to be comforting, but there's a difference between comfort and apathy. Emily just seems like she's not into it at all, and he basically puts her to sleep! If I was Ashley I'd be seriously disappointed in myself as a man. On the plus side, I found myself enjoying Luke and Anna a lot, so now I'm going to go read ""Heartless"", since I came into this series backwards."
5,A TOUCHING LOVE STORY,"THIS HAS BEEN A DRAMATIC STORY ABOUT A DEAF MUTE HEROINE. I HAD NEVER READ ANY EXCEPTIONAL NOVELS BEFORE LIKE THIS. YET, MARY BALOGH HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EXCEPTIONAL WRITER! WAY TO GO! I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A POWERFUL FICTION STORY SHE EVER WRITTEN!"
3,Passable read!,"Having read Balogh's novels previously, I thought this was quite formulaic! I skipped a number of pages since Balogh always has some sort of pre-marital sexual situations somewhere before the characters fall in love. Emmy had a strong character though and complex enough for a Romance heroine! Ashley was not too well developed and neither was the villain in this piece. In fact, he was the most disappointing villain ever... He had no strong motive, no insanity, not even ruthless passion to destruct. A very unsatisfactory ending. And in all, a passable read.."
3,"A sweet, well written story....(3 1/2)","Silent Melody was a sweet heartfelt read...I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Mary Balogh, however it wasnt for me. I did enjoy it, but I have found that in having read a few of her other books in the past, that while they are good, they just arent for me...I would definitely not dissuade anyone from reading this book..I just personally prefer other authors."
5,A GOOD REISSUE OF THE COLUMBIA LP SWEET LITTLE JESUS BOY,Sound quality from the original monoural tapes are good and clear. At least CBS SPECIAL PRODUCTS brought out this long out of print LP from the COLUMBIA RECORDS catalogue.This makes sense!
5,One of my favorites,I've had this Christmas album on tape for a long time. It is one of my favorites. I'm amazed to find it so inexpensive so I'm going to replace my tape with the CD. It is one of the most beautiful Christmas albums ever.
3,Interesting,"This is an interesting journal. I live near places Sally writes about in her journal. It would have been excellent if an editor had provided some background information about the place, time and person."
5,Parody Movie is a MUST SEE,"I am a huge fan of Independent films, and this one is by far... at the top of my list.It's not only very creative but also more importantly... original.The best part is when I have friends over and they get to watch it for their time, my house is full of laughter.This movie should come with a warning: ""Don't attempt to eat food or drink liquids while watching this film, cause it will be sprayed across the room from laughing so hard"".I look forward to more films from Mr. Dewandeler."
4,Timely subject matter,"This study is very timely for me in that I have recently received questions in the weekly ladies Bible study I teach about God's blessings. However, I find the format in the Leaders Edition confusing and have to frequently refer to the Learners Edition to organize the presentation of the study."
5,Simply the best rts game to date.,"I am very particular about the games I buy, This is without a doubt the best stradegy game I've ever played. This game is not only good , but will keep you entertained for guite a while because there are so many options to choose from. I agree with some of the other reviewers, I played this game for 8 hours, never got bored,because the time just seemed to past by, highly addictive. This game just keeps you so in to it, you don't want to stop , just remember there are 4 main objectives, to getting you going in this game,taxes,food protection, and religion. Make sure your popularity stay above 70 until you get your castle established pretty well. I kept the tax level to no taxes, until I got every thing going to my advantage, then you can go up to above mean taxes if you wish. Try this game out , I seriously don't think you will be disappointed."
3,VERY FUN GAME BUT,"I beat strong hold and loved when I heard crusader was coming I rushed out to buy it it was fun the levals are ok still has the same idea as stronghold wich i loved ,grapics are good and gampelay is greaat but were is the plot it just like you are playing a bunch of levals for no reason since im one of those peaple you like a good plot in a game it got a little boring.I still play it and I woud recomand it to some peaple but if you like a plot then buy the first one."
3,Not too fun like it seems.......,"This game is not fun after a while. If you really like stragedy games I will recomended but if you want to go to action right away or built giant armies this game is not for you.This game is mostly about castle builing,you built everything for example if you want armor you have to make an iron mine.After a while it gets the same and you get bored really quicly.The campaign sucks,its better if you do the missions instead."
1,Guy skipped town and we never saw product and never saw return of money,"Wish I still had this guy's info. I would definitely not recommend him to anyone, anywhere, anytime. It is sad."
1,"Fun, but it just didn't have it...",I liked Stronghold 2 and Stronghold Legends was OK but this game is just so outdated and the graphics stank so much I could only play it twice before I never looked at it again.
4,Great expansion.,For an expansion this game is a must have if you liked the original Stronghold. There was A LOT more game play in this expansion than I thought there would be. On the down side the campaign has no real plot but it was still fun to play. I am glad I bought it.
5,could it get any better?!?!,"this game is the best medevil warfare/strategy game i have evr played by a longshot. the graphics are amazing, and the intense battle secuenses are EXTRORDINARY!!!! i play this constantly and can hardly turn it off. is is the best pc war game ever invented!!!"
4,"Addicting, non-productive fun","If you don't have anything to do for the next couple of months, get this game! It's fun, it's addicting. The graphics are great, the music is annoying after the first 20 minutes. It's challenging and a decent waste of time."
2,very good book,"This book is very well written; the author extensively covers related areas of research in a fairly neutral and professional way. The facts are offered in a sensible and plain manner with ample verification. Extremely interesting interviews and well documented facts, this book sheds a brilliant new light on the growing interest of the Philadelphia experiment."
3,Not a bad moive,I orginally got this movie because Gillian Anderson is in it and I love her. The story line is good but you do have to listen really carefully if your like me and don't understand Irish English slang it can be difficult to understand. Story line is good but if you are a dog lover you might want to prepare yourself for some very intense scenes of animal cruilty.
4,"Very good, but not as good as Vatican 1","This is a solid follow up to the Vatican 1 Mixtape, not a great as the first one but definitely worth picking up, especially if you are a Raekwon fan"
5,Must Have for the Triumph Enthusiast.,"For anyone who is interested in the history of Post war triumphs, this book provides a thorough and complete history of the Triumph sports cars from 1952 onward. From the side screen TR-2 roadsters to the refined TR-8's all the details and specifications are provided."
4,Sort of different,"Has a bit of medicinal taste thats not all that unpleasant, but definitely different. Buy it for its health benefits, but stick to local honey for flavor."
5,"if you remember, grew up with peanuts comic strip","I remember when this album came onto the market. We bought it immediately. I became my younger brother, and my favorite album.. oh the magic of Charlie Brown in his wisdom and humility , caring personality at Christmas time touches the heart. So to this album, why even the Red Baron and Snoopy make a truce to celebrate Christmas. For us older folks, a five because of a favorite by tradition with fond memories, for your children, a wonderful album for children, again the segments of time you can listen to the songs is not misleading, considering you get thirty seconds that is the beginning of each song."
4,Very good stories and photos,I enjoyed reading this edition. It had many stories of older people and included some striking photographs of farming families in England. I learned that the steam engine was first heavily used in England and was first used in agriculture there. Cool!
3,Smallest Male Tag Heuer watch ever,"The Watch is very small with a Small Link band. If you look it is 36mm diameter. Most tags are 40 to 42, which I now know makes a big difference. If you are a small guy this watch will be fine, but if your like me it looks like a woman's watch when you put it on."
4,So has Columbia International University Read This Yet?,My daughter - in college - thinks this book is quite useful. Glad she does - as the professor gave her little choice about it as her textbook.
5,Sound analysis and advice; succint and effective style,"This book is well written and brief. (It's amazing how often those two go together!) The contents are as follows:_____________________________Preface1. Why a Christian College?2. Theological Foundations3. The Liberal Arts: What and Why?4. Liberal Arts as Career Preparation5. Integrating Faith and Learning6. Academic Freedom7. College as Community8. Experience is not Enough9. The Marks of an Educated PersonSuggestions for further reading_____________________________The chapter on integrating faith and learning was especially good, as was the chapter on academic freedom. Refreshingly lucid thinking and writing: no stale ideas to be found."
1,GARBAGE!,"This is without a doubt the most useless book written on the subject of Adolph Hitler I have ever read.first of all,this book takes the all time winner prize for objectivity with quotes like,""To some degree,he(Hitler)has already become a legendary creature,rather like Dracula or Frankenstien's Monster,the stuff of horror movies or comedies.""There is a small chaptercalled Hitler ln combat that starts of with,""What a tantilizing vision-Hitler killed in the first world war.Unfortunately,he not only survived the fighting,he thrived on it.""with questionable information because of subjective,and lack of usefullness,this book will never be taken seriously by even an ametuer historian,as it is more a joke book for entertainment.Don't waist your money."
1,History is written by the victors,"This book is masterful mix of facts and sins: sins ofomission and sins of comission.If you wanted just the facts about this man don't waste you timewith the ""fact"" book. It's loaded with severely slantedcommentary, Psychlogical theories and more nonsense from anauthor who is incapable of presenting unbiased history. It hasbeen said that Hitler is the most lied about man of the 20thcentury and author Fuchs is one of the rowd: Repeating the same untruths from our so called ""experts"".Where are the alternative views? Where is the german view? Whereis the White view? History is always written by the winners ofwar and the losers view is always supressed. Might is right inthis world. The truth will always be victim to the barrel of a gun."
3,I wanted to like this better.,"Zubin Mehta conducted a terrific recording of Mahler's 2nd symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1975, and decent Mahler 3rd and 5ths in Los Angeles a couple of years later. It's been pretty much down hill since then, with rather undistinguished readings with the Israel Philharmonic and NYPO, and this latest with the Bavarian State Orchestra. I didn't care for the soloist (Marjena Lipovsek), and the entire enterprise just lacks the sense of wonder which an outstanding performance of the Mahler 3rd creates. I'd suggest either Bernstein, the Levine, or the Abbado Berlin recording if you want to hear this the way it should be performed."
2,Okay,I got this for my cockatiel to play with... I attached a string to them and hung them inside the cage but all he did was hiss at them! I am going to get a ferret soon and I guess they will be the ferret's to take over. I loved the bright colors and the bells make it more interactive!Okay for ferrets bad for birds...
5,Pearls are Perfect!,I bought these for my wife and they are exactly as specified. Knots between each pearl and everything. My wife was very happy with her gift.
2,Disappointed,"This item was purchased for my grandson's second birthday with the intention of adding train cars and tracks for future growth. Unfortunately, this particular Brio train set is NOT compatible with any Brio train sets (not mentioned in the description)and the tunnel is foam covered with fabric. After paying over $60, I could not return the item unless I paid FOREIGN shipping costs to ENGLAND!!So disappointed, the item is still in the box!"
4,review of brio train my first railway set,"I thought this toy was really cute....perfect for the age range and a great toy for getting the child to interact and use their imagination. Overall, the quality of the brio toys is great."
3,Not much for the money,I would have returned if grand son had not seen and played with you can get more for the money if you shop a little more
5,excellent cd,"Hekkema is a total virtuoso. The Cd is really good, great sound quality.The seller was expeditious and eficient. Excelent service!"
2,Small Heads Always Disappoint,"Delta Sunflower 4-Inch Shower Head, Chrome #75161It's inexpenseive and you get what you pay for; smaller is NOT better not matter what they say. I trashed mine."
4,Interesting life!,Not sure Pamela is the best writer in the world but she certainly has led a colourful and entertaining life. Worth a read :-)
4,Once Upon A Time...,"...there was a glorious art form known as rock and roll, and it changed the world. Not to be confused with what passes for the same these days, rock and roll was at the crest of a tidal wave of social experimentation that for better or for worse shoved the culture of the young into prominence and re-made America from the inside out. Pamela Des Barres defies all preconceived notions in this memoir of her years as friend/lover/muse and so much else to some of the biggest names in late-twentieth-century music. Surprisingly discreet as well as good-natured, Des Barres gives her reader the ultimate backstage pass with stories of Jim Morrison, Mick Jagger, Led Zeppelin, Frank Zappa, and even the titular King of Rock and Roll, himself! This is a one of a kind sort of book, and it's a heck of a fun read!"
4,I wish it had been me!,"Great read, though she is a bit of a name dropper. Sounds like she had a ball and deep down, I wish it would have been me. Much more innocent time, though."
2,Disappointing,"I'm not sure what I expected, but what I didn't expect was a version of my own dysfunctional journal when I was that age - except without the famous names. It's the voice of a sugary little Sandra Dee doll who trades her white nightie for mini skirts and platform shoes while she's looking for true love - and mistaking everything that isn't for what she thinks is. I enjoyed the epilogues more because they had more substance and maturity, and weren't so teen-agey in their tone.The book is almost entirely composed of sentences such as:""I was so relieved and so happy when we finished the album""""The girls and I spent a lot of time making lists of all the gorgeous boys we wouldn't kick out of bed.""""Donnie bought me exquisite little trinkets of love.""""I had an insance crush on Darryl.""I finished it, but I could as easily have put it down mid-way through and not felt as if I missed anything. It's not staying in my collection - it's in the Goodwill donation pile."
3,A great book for chicks & classic rock fans,"This book is especially enjoyable if you're into celebrity ""name-dropping"" books. You won't believe some of the famous men that made Pamela's acquaintance! I don't name-drop, so read the book for yourself if you're intrigued. I will say, however, that among them are several musicians of the 60's & 70's and one actor who briefly made white suits popular again.This book will also be of interest to true classic rock fans.While the author is no Shakespeare, she sure knows how to spin a tale! I admire her because she followed her heart and lived an ""alternative"" but fulfilling lifestyle when other women her age married young and started breeding. Bravo to Pamela for lavishing in her youth and ""getting it out of her system""!Read this if you're looking for something fun that'll keep you turning the pages...but not thinking too hard..."
3,"Despite reviews to the contrary, this does read like a dripping teen romance novel","In many ways, my expectations of this book were shaped by the reviews I read. ""honest look at the life of a groupie"" ""does not read like a porn novel"".However, it does read like a teenager's love diary, and let's be honest. That's what this is. It is not a retrospective from an adult's point of view as much as it is a re-living of a teen's formative years as a successful groupie.Because of this specifically, because of how the book READS, I am forced to consider it an average read at best. If this were not a kindle edition, the book might have been found in one of my bathrooms as a light read."
2,A peek at the 60's,This was a pretty quick read and only interesting if you grew up in this era and knew of the bands and players. I am sure there are hundreds of groupie girls with similar stories.
3,Fun Read,"I love the history of music you get through the story. Lots of characters to keep track of. A little lovely dovey teen heart throb, but it works for the author."
1,I'm with the Band,"Wow... my money would have been better spent buying Teen Beet magazine. This ""book"" is nothing more than a recycled diary from a drug addled girl in her teens and twenties, living through her rock idols' fantasies. My guess is they are more her fantasies than theirs. The only thing I learned from her ""writing"", is that she seems pretty self-involved. Nothing new here about some of my favorite artists from the era, only old stories told with Miss P's name added. Do yourselves a favor, and pass on this one. If you feel you have to read it, borrow it!"
4,Enjoy,"Relax and enjoy. I gave this book four stars because it is downright entertaining and enjoyable to read. The stories are great, and from a female standpoint we have all been there, perhaps with not the Mick Jaggers of the world. Great book, not the most intellectual, but fun to read and great stories."
1,Just sad.,"This is just a very sad account of a person whose total identity comes from other people's successes and fame. It's amazing how a person can build their entire existence trying to live through other people.I lent this to my sisters after trying to get through the whole book, and neither of them could finish it."
1,Ehh!,"I just could not get into this. So I sent it on to the town library. They can put it on their shelves, or inventory for the next book sale."
2,Sad,"I'm with the Band: Confessions of a GroupieMostly a ""grottie"" story of a woman whose ambitions to star-doom focused more on the availability of her genetalia than on her talent. Name f'ing for the sole sake of name dropping. This review may not be published but it is true. I mostly felt so heart broken about her choices that the addition of the proximity of the famous was not enough to make those choices worthy."
2,I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie,I thought this book would be better than it was. It's boring and not very intersting due to how she wrote the book.
1,I'm with the band,"If you are reading this book to get info on the sex lives of various rock icons, save your money. There are no details at all about sex with any of them, just names and how nice everyone is. Too sweet and neat to be factual. You would think they were all wonderful people who were good to everyone and knocked themselves out to be great to Pamela. There was little mention of substance abuse or any other issue that would reflect badly on the icons. If you want someone gushing over every icon she ever met, then this is the one for you."
5,Ever sunny...,"The fun in Pamela Des Barres rock-gossip fest is her ability to convey more than dry anecdotes. She has a wit, and an appealing style of honesty and self-deprecation - one senses even she is bemused by her former ever-sunny, ever-hopeful, latching-on self.There is no dearth of 'meat' in this book. I love it most for her observations - evocative of a time and attitude, and naked honesty about herself.I've re-read ""I'm With the Band"" so many times over several years that it should be on my 'Guilty Pleasures' list...but I don't feel guilty! I think her book will appeal to anyone who lives or has lived in L.A. and is interested in music and/or pop culture of that time period. (60's/70's)."
3,Very good read,"I enjoyed this book a lot. It is really nice to read about the 60's- a time before I was even born!I love the photo on the cover too- very 60's as well.Pamela seems to have lived a life some only dream of.All in all, this is a good book to have in your collection of bios if that is what floats your boat."
4,One woman's journey through rock music...,"I grew up in the 70's, about a decade behind Ms. Des Barres, and found her book to not only be a sincere look at her emotional journey, but a fascinating perspective on the music scene during a time when I was still pretty much in elementary school.Miss Pamela's writing style kept me interested and entertained, while her journal notes added insights into the workings of her mind and heart during this long and winding odyssey. A fun read, but with more depth than I expected."
4,what's wrong with me!,"God help me; i found this book compulsive reading. this is the kind of gossipy work that i know i should look down on. i should feel sorry for the author that she seems to draw her sense of meaning in life from the fact that she KNEW celebrities. I know, i know i should. but i don't. i admit it. i really liked this book. it was fun. all fans of late 60's and early 70's rock and roll should find this a great read, in fact. it's one of the most entertaining books on the music world that i've read. God help me."
1,Boring - no rock star insight,"I bought this book thinking I'd get some candid behind-the-scenes insight into what it would be like to hang out with the rock stars of the 60's and 70's. No luck. Just Pamela obsessing about finding the next band member to lay and wondering why she wasn't a star. I'd recommend Zep's ""Hammer Of The Gods"" or Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way""."
2,Shallow,"I thought that by reading this book I would gain some insight into the lives of the various musicians who are featured in its pages. This did not turn out to be the case. Basically all you learn about people like Mick Jagger and Keith Moon is that they had sex with the author of the book.The tone of ""I'm with The Band"" zigzaggs wildly between extreme infatuation and intense lonliness with nothing in between. After a few chapter you begin to realize that the entire book follows this formula:1) The author falls head-over-heels in love with some celebrity.2) They have idealized sex.3) The author gets lonely.4) The author meets another celebrity.Lather, wrinse, and repeat..."
1,Not what I thought,Just a lot of mindless fluff I was expecting not just dirt but some behind the scenes look at a lot of rock royalty.
1,"Boring, Poorly Written","Honestly, I haven't managed to muddle all the way through this book because everytime I start it gets too boring to finish. Poorly written, which is pretty sad since most rock band books are at least salaciously guilty reading, but this is a snoozer, no idea how it managed to get avg.rating of 4starts here! Don't waste your money."
1,Immature juvenile writing style,"This was as if reading a grade school account of a person with no self esteem. The sentence construction throughout the book was highly immature. Incomplete thoughts, non-sequitors, etc. The drug abuse took quite a toll on the author. She has been seen rolling on the floor at the Whiskey A-Go-Go distraught and in tears over another ""star"" walking out on her. In her later book she tells of her son's later abuse and bullying in school over her notoriety. In the inside sleeve of Permanent Damage she thanks Jesus. Hopefully she has turned to Him to turn her life around for the better especially being a cancer survivor."
1,kind of stupid,I didn't care for this book at all. It was hard to follow and thought it would be semi in the present! hee hee!! It was long long ago.
5,Clemens does it again,James Clemens came out of nowhere and is blowing every Fantasy writer away. This series is by far one of the best out there. Not just for sci-fi buffs.But anyone who enjoys a good plot and twists. This installment is the best by far with many twists and turns to leave you eagerly awaiting the 4th. KEEP WRITING MR. CLEMENS.QUICK QUICK QUICK.
4,action filled series,"I've enjoyed the two previous books in this series and looked forward to reading the third. For the most part the characters are interesting and diverse. My only complaint was that the author could drag on a fight scene forever. A short encounter can go on for thirty pages with discriptions and flashbacks. These ""action"" scenes can be a tension grabber, but when a reader has to read and read and read and read just to find out who the attactor is, well, you kind of just loose interest. I kept finding myself flipping to a few pages ahead to see when it would end. Normally I would give three stars for an author with this problem, but because the two previous books were for the most part much better, I gave her an extra star for previous good writing."
5,Looking for More,"James Clemens continues to evolve in his writing style with each new release of this series. I have now read the first 3 books twice, and enjoyed them even more the second time. The author's ability to spin a tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat is astounding.I believe Mr. Clemens has a long career ahead of him as a Sci-fi/Fantasy writer."
1,Kindle?,"What in the world! I just finished book 2, and book 3 isn't available on kindle? 4 and 5 are though? UGH...."
2,"So-so, could be worse","Sure there are worse books in the fantasy genre. This one ranks square in the middle. What's with all the 5 star reviews? haven't these people read Tolkien? Stephen Donaldson? Anne Mccaffrey? Mists of Avalon? Wouldn't even those who enjoyed this book give it a 3-4 because Tolkien is a true 5 star? This book has a real pulp feel, lots happens but I found myself not caring about it much because the characters were not interesting nor was the world, etc. Good thing I didn't buy it!"
5,Mr. Clemens does it again,"Just like the previous two books, I couldn't put this one down. Great, I can't wait for him to write more."
5,Wit'ch war,"I absolutely loved this book and every book that James Clemens, James Rollins writes. He is an awesome writer. I buy his books as soon as they come out."
5,AMAZING,"I love this series! I have seen some reviews for these books that I just don't know how someone could not like them. I got the first book a few years ago, it was a free download on my itouch. I finished it in one night, unfortunately I had no money at the time so I could not get the other books. I have never been able to find them at my local bookstores, so the first thing I did when I got my kindle fire was buy and download all of them. I never forgot about this series over the years. I would recommend these books for anyone who has good taste in literature."
5,Gripping . . . keeps you on the edge of your seat,"It's been a while since I've read a book that's had such a gripping effect on me. To say the least, Wit'ch War was an amazing read. Clemens really outdoes himself, with both plot originality and pacing. I first picked up The Banned and the Banished series because my friend wouldn't stop raving about it. I have to admit, I wasn't all that impressed by the first book of the series; I thought Clemens was trying too hard, with too much plot and action and not enough attention on making his prose flow as well as possible. Needless to say, he has definitely come a long way since the first book. The second book of the series was WAY better, and this one, number three in the series, truly lived up to and BEYOND my expectations for it. I'm so glad I purchased a copy of this book. It was worth every penny.For more of my review, check my blog: [...]"
1,"Defective product, right out of the box.","I bought this collander thinking I could use it to strain pasta. I liked that it was stainless steel and had some sort of feet. After taking it out of the package, I was looking it over when I noticed one of the handles was sliding up and down when I touchd it. The handle then broke off in my hand. I guess mine had some bad weld joints on it or something. If you get this, be gentle with the handles incase you have one with weak or defective handles like mine. I might still keep it, just because the handles aren't essential, but I'm getting upset thinking the legs might break off too.Pros: Stainless steel, handles and feet, looks durable, easier to clean holes than some others, since holes are large and few.Cons: Handles are soldered/welded on weakly and break off easily, holes are too large to use as a strainer (my old one had MANY small holes)"
5,Best fiction style guide,"Hands-down the best grammar reference for fiction writers. The needs of a fiction writer require the occasional bending and stretching of rules, a fact of the writing life you won't find acknowledged in CMOS or other guides, most of which focus on business and academic writing. This, Strunk & White, and Self-editing for Fiction Writers need to be in every writer's toolbox."
5,Best of all time!,"Who could'nt like this!?!?!!?!?!???!!!?! This is one of the greatest games in history of gaming. People who say these are just copies.. come on,we all know that most are copies,yes. But people say this is a copy too,heck NO! THIS IS WAY DIFFERENT! NEW FEATURES!FOR YOUR INFO,WIERD 1 STAR DUMMYS,YOU MUST NOT HAVE BRAINS! The game boards are faster then ever,oh did I mention there's now daylight saving time?!?! That feature is so cool! There's one new character to unlock. I'll tell so you will buy this,Toadette,the mushroom girl. Ya know wha else is new 1 star folks,there's a microphone! The games on the Miocrophone are so addicting!!!! So,buy this and enjoy 80 new mini games and fun. Or enjoy being bored on the NGC for the rest of your life."
5,"nice game, i even like playing it by myself!","Mario Party 6 is the first Mario Party to have a microphone feature. My copy of the game didn't include the mic, so i don't know how good the mic is. But you can still play the mic mini-games even without the mic. you go to option mode, set the mic to use controller, and start playing the games using the R button on your controller. It may not be as fun, but it is better than not playing them at all. Other than the mic feature this year's mario party is pretty much the same as all the other games. Of course, the mini-games are different and the party mode boards are new, but it still follows all the other games in the series. My rating? 9 stars (out of 10) when your playing alone. 11 stars (out of 5) when your playing with friends."
5,Dang good game,"I bought MP6 to play with my girlfriend an d it's our favorite game to play together even months later. The microphone peripheral is crazy fun even if it's a little glitchy. Really, the glitchiness makes it even more fun. The mini-games in MP6 are as fun as any other."
4,Best Mario Party for GCN,"I did not like Mario Party 4 or 5 very much... but this one's an exception. It's the best Mario Party game for the GCN... so if you are going to get a Mario Party game this is the one to get, the mini games you'll find to be much better than the other GCN Mario Partys. This game I find to be some what similar to Peach's Birthday Cake in the first Mario Party (for those who got the first one that is)."
2,Man... Mario Sure Does Throw a Lot of Parties!,"If you're a newcomer to the series, maybe... just maybe... you should get it. But, if you've played it before, it's the same ****ing rules."
3,Same game.. different look.,"What started as a quirky, interesting use of Mario and all his iconic friends on the N64 has turned into an annual bash, which is now in its sixth year. On the surface, Mario Party 6 seems to offer some of the biggest fundamental changes the series has ever seen. But this is really just a fresh coat of paint on an old building. As always, Mario Party 6 is modeled after a board game, of sorts. Much of the other changes that Mario Party 6 makes to the Mario Party formula are largely superficial.Whether you've worn out your last copy of Mario Party or are just looking for a light, accessible multiplayer experience, number six is a fine pick. Alternately, if you have yet to be charmed by previous Mario Party games, this one isn't likely to change your opinion of the series."
1,"Fun, fun, FUN!!","I recently got this toy as a birthday gift. The microphone that comes with it gets annoying. Like, when you say, ""up"" sometimes Mario will freeze instead of moving up. The party mode is awesome! They didn't completely redo this game. For all of you who like Mario Party 5, Mario Party 6 is for you! I have one last thing to say, it's a Mario game! Why wouldn't it be FUN!?"
3,Mario Party...=/,"I just go this game yesterday and it wasn't as fun as expected it to be. Mario Party 2 and 3 were way better. Mario Party 5 a bit boring. The new mini games aren't that great, and the microphone is not really necessary. Maybe playing with families or friends may be a bit more fun. Buy this game if you have siblings to play with..."
1,NOT MAC FRIENDLY,"I guess in China, they have never heard of Macintosh (They only build them), because this product does not work with a Mac. I imagine after spending more money on really sophisticated video converters might help. The disc that they give you with the install/video converter is a 3Inch disc that will not work on any side loaded iMac, which is pretty much all of them, and it wouldn't work anyway because they are exe. files, which Mac's don't read. When I did get a video to work, it was after trying over a dozen files. The player is very picky about what files it decides it will like.The interface takes a bit getting used to as well, but at least it looks really good. However, not good enough to waist your time."
1,Would not even turn on,"Absolutely the worst digital product I have ever owned. It never even turned on, only the screen would flash. I plugged it into the computer and nothing happened. I wish I would have read the forums before I got this because many are complaining of this problem and the ""forum admins"" are helpless: ""Just try again..""I've owned Apple, Sony, Sandisk and Creative players and they all worked! I will avoid all Meizu products because of this experience."
2,Touch Pad Stuck,"I just received the player in the mail today. I went to turn it on, and the clicking sound you get while scrolling just started going on its own. It would NEVER stop scrolling. I formatted/updated about 3 times, no help there. I also checked google and meizume along with all of the other forums, and they said it was a hardware defect."
3,Could have been a great book,"Written with care and knowledge, this book is severely undermined by poor editing. Some photos are informative while others are simply superfluous. That said, it's worth the current $10 cover price."
4,Excellent pictures and interesting text,"I would not understand why to speak about ""chicken breeds"", if chickens are all the same, yellow/brown-coloured birds. So I bought this book to enlarge my views and my culture...and a whole new world opened to me! chickens laying brown, blue or almost black eggs... black chickens... enormous breeds... fighting chickens, upright and severe... dozens and dozens of nice looking, historical european, american and asian breeds... bantams...The book is very well organized, featuring a lot of very nice pictures and interesting accompanying text on chickens social behaviour and other technical details on coloring (that I sometimes found a bit boring) and posture. It's maybe not really an ENCYCLOPEDIA, but it actually is a superb introduction to chicken breeds for a chicken enthusiast."
2,not complete,Title is very misleading. This book while informative and a good source is far from complete. It covers most topics incompletely. It would be much more helpful if it covered fewer topics but covered the ones it did in greater detail. This book will be useful for you until you find the book that covers what you want. It will eventually be useless as you compile a set of better resources.
3,Lacking a little,"Great overall reference book with the basics. I was surprised to see some common breeds not included in this ""Encyclopedia."" I do recommend the book as a starters guide."
4,The Complete Encyclopeda of Chickens,"Very good Photography, detailed discription, though no size or weights provided, concentrated mainly on European poultry, disapointed little information on Australian Poultry fancy.Would recommend this book for the novice & experienced breeder to have in their Library."
4,My hamster likes it.,"I have 2 robo hamsters and these are good for their teeth, i dont really see them chewing alot but it is still a bit of color and fun to their cage!"
1,Really rotten--Don't waste your money!!!,"The sound quality is really terrible, but even if it were fantastic, it wouldn't help the lousy back-up vocals and tinny-sounding synthesizer in the background. The guy has trouble staying on key--I can sing better than he can, and that's NOT a good thing. Don't waste your money on this!!!"
1,"Badly written, hard to follow.","This book just lists up most of the topics related to multimedia, and it's really hard to follow the authors' writing. The organization is bad, so I got frequently lost while reading the book. Too much errta, and wrong figures. The ugliest scientic and/or engineering book I've ever read!!!"
5,Reported to be Alive,It is hard to imagine man's inhumanity to man.This book is hard to put down.It is a must read for people to see just what can happen to them in certain circumstances.Mr. Wolfkill's endurance under terrible conditions is truly remarkable.
3,Outdated,Unfortunately the information in this book is outdated. The world of the Internet chages so quickly it is difficult to get a book to market with current information in a timely fashion.
5,Outstanding story,"After seeing ""With Fire and Sword"" and ""The Deluge,"" I surprised myself by guessing Pan Zagloba's line as he tossed away an empty wine bottle before the subtitle appeared: ""I hate empty bottles!"" Michael Wolodyjowski is the perfect soldier and Basia is a likeable and plucky heroine.Daniel Olbrychski is good as Ayza Bey and even better as Tuhaj Bey in ""With Fire and Sword."" The story and the performances are absolutely outstanding, although the film's color leaves something to be desired.The story ends with a premonition of how Colonel Wolodyjowski's death will be avenged, and it is unfortunate that Sienkiewicz never wrote a sequel that portrayed the Battle of Vienna (1683). Jan Skshetuski from ""With Fire and Sword"" would have been around sixty and could have taken part along with his numerous sons."
5,Works great for dogs with minor allergies,My 3 year old Airedale has allergies. This works great for minor allergies. Does not make her too sleepy and she does well with taking the medication. Small enough pill to slip into her kibbles.
1,Did not Help,This product did not help my dog with her skin allergy. Dont waste your money. My dog did not have a serious problem but this did nothing to help.
2,This tape was of poor quality !!!,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR. THE TAPE WAS OBVOUSLY ONE THAT WAS IN POOR CONDITION TO START WITH. THE TAPE WOULD FREEZE UP AT VARIOUS TIMES.. THIS TAPE WAS PLAYED ON A B-R-A-N-D N-E-W MACHINE !!!
5,It is a craft and educational book!,I really liked this book and it provided me with information I hadn't gotten anywhere else. The crafts are a good way for students to be active and learn. Education isn't just book reading. People need to learn to create with their head and their hands. This is a book that blends ancient civilizations with creative activities. Good work!
5,Summer Art Camp uses this book,"This is an outstanding book for use by educators. The projects and information are detailed and clear, very easy to follow. Our Summer Art Camp for children ages 5-12 will be using the projects from this book for our time machine trip to ancient Egypt of crafts, costumes, ceramics, etc of the period. This book is perfect for what we are doing!"
2,Poor customer service,"I have used Verizon for years and currently have this 900 plan. Lately they have gotten very underhanded with ""bait and switch"" tactics. Following bad advice from customer service, I canceled two add-on lines and then found out they had extended my contract without telling me. Cost me $350.Be careful! They now extend your contract every time you make any change to your plan."
4,PANTS RACK,"WANTED TO BUY THESE AT LOWE'S WHEN WE STARTED OUR CLOSET BUT NOT AVAILABLE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE SHOWN IN PICTURES. FOUND HERE AT AMAZON, ORDERED AND SHIPPED QUICKLY. EASY TO ASSEMBLE, BUT SLIGHTLY SMALLER THAN OTHER HANGING RACKS FROM RUBBERMAID SERIES. MY OTHER HALF LOVES THE RACKS BECAUSE HE HATES TO MESS WITH HANGERS. LOOKS GREAT."
5,The best system yet for a cloths horse!,"These pant/skirt rods are the best organizer for my closet I have ever used. (I have tried many systems) Configurations are a neat, easy to find, space saving, and economical system too! I have 4 sets of these and 4 wire sliding baskets with 8 shelves. I also use the custom deluxe hanging system for long things and more shoe shelves. The best part is the ability to customize for individual needs. A good looking setup in titanium/chrome. Just purchased another setup of these for another closet. I also have a walk-in Calif. closet set up. This system is easier to use/find items then in my walk-in and it is in a standard 10 foot run behind sliding doors."
3,A bit wide in the closet,"Make sure you have have room for this item. It is a bit wide. Installation is easier if the brackets are installed before assembly. The screws are not hard to install once the support brackets are on the standards. Takes up a lot of space but moves very smoothly.I got two one on top of the other to minimize the space this takes up. If I had it to do again, I would not buy these and just use regular pants hangers."
2,"Very difficult to install, takes up too much space for what it holds","Overall the Rubbermaid configurations are very easy to install. Just this piece, it was very difficult.1. You must install the original bars at exactly 2' apart, even if a little wider / narrow, you'll have a heck of a time trying to put this pant holder on.2. When you finally sucessfully install it, you'll find this item takes way too much space than what it's worth. In the space you fit 1 pant holder, you can fit 2 x 26"" shelves. If you fold the pants, you can put a lot more. If you use a pants cloth hanger, it'll hold a lot more than 7 pairs in that area.3. This unit costs $50, it looks nice, but in actual use, it's inferior compared to the other parts and accessories of the Rubbermaid Configuration.Got 2 of these, ended up returning both and bought more of the 26"" shelves, far more useful."
4,Very good customization item,Pants rack adds level of customization that is impressive. Quality component that slides in and out easily for access.
4,well researched and readable,"You don't have to be an ardent bicyclist or military history buff to enjoy this book. It explores a combination of both bicycling and military tactics that has been neglected throughout the written history of bikes and wars. For the devoted student of either aspect, the research notes and bibliography alone are worth the Kindle price of the book.For the casual reader with an inquiring mind, it is just a darn good read with plenty of photos."
4,Must Have for Mastering 3DS MAX 5,"This book is essential for the newbie. It eases you into the 3D world of 3D Studio. You feel confident that you can master this bohemoth of a program. One caveat to an otherwise glowing review is the section on spline modelling. The author mentions that this is an essential aspect of modelling, which it is, but gives very little instruction and drops you into a nearly impossible spline modelling tutorial. This part was very frustrating.If you really want to learn the ins and outs of Max quickly you should purchase this book and after you are familiar with the interface and functionality, go back to the discreet supplied tutorials - the two together are a complete package."
3,REHASH!!!,"Most of this text is a rehash of Ms. Bousquet's 2 previous works on 3DSTUDIO MAX 3, and 3DS MAX 4, respectively. Even the tutorials are the same! Outrageous!!!"
5,CUTCO is great!,"Not only because of their lifetime sharpness and lifetime replacement guarantees. Which is nice if they are accidently misused. I had my son cutting with my chef's knife on glass and stone when I was on vacation. I called them and they sharpened it for free. They said if it needed to be replaced they would have done that also. PS I can get cutco for 20% cheaper than anyplace iv'e seen. That's like $200 Saved on this item alone. Email me directly. or contact me on amazon ""BigFarscape"""
2,Adam Rediscovered...** stars,"Simply put, a ""political statement"" movie in the mold of Schindler's List. While the acting is excellent, the story is all over the place, and it is very hard to maintain interest beyond 15-20 minutes...the trailer summerizes the movie, unless you are into Holocaust history...this is not very entertaining...."
2,You'll need CliffsNotes to understand it.,This is the kind of artsy film you watched in English class and broke up into small groups and discussed for 2 weeks.The trailer explains more about the story than the movie.
2,Not durable,"Disappointed in this product. Purchased for a preschool playground and after the first day, the phone fell off the wall. Many teachers complained, little tikes is just not made as well as it used to be. Kids love it but it doesn't look like it's going to last very long. We bought this house b/c it was the biggest we could find for 4 and 5 year olds. I think better for 2 & 3 year olds."
4,"good for a x-men newbie, bad for a hardcore x-fan","it offered a brief stint into the past lives of rogue, wolverine, and magneto. Being an x-fan, i can tell you that most of this book is very innacurate. Either the writer didnt do much research, or he meant it to be much unlike the comic book series. I do believe that this book is meant to be a ""prequel"" for the upcoming movie. But if that is so, the movie will be very innacurate also. For instanct, wolverine and storm joined the x-men at the same time, when in this book, it suggests that storm preceded wolverine in her membership. There are many other innacuracies. But to be positive, all 3 stories are very well written and have excellent plots. the art is good too. If you can look past the inaccuracy of it, you will like this book."
5,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"The book was in excellent shape and I received it very fast, that was great because I needed it for a class.Great job, and thanks!"
5,My favorite Louis CK special.,"I'm a big Louis CK fan, but this is by far one of my favorite of his comedy specials! If you're easily offended by language or sexual content, then don't watch it, but his sarcastic yet realistic re-telling of his stories/experiences/opinions has me laughing nonstop from the time it starts to the time it ends."
4,hilarious,"If you're already a fan of Louis CK, you'll like this stand up special. Its one of his earlier ones, so its a little more raw and vulger, still the same style, just less developed. If you don't know who he is, but you like to watch comedy specials, you still won't be disappointed. He talks about being a middle aged, unattractive, slightly over weight, married man, and how depressing that can be. How annoying his kids are, even though he would die for them. Over all, I thought it was hilarious."
5,Great,"Just plain excellent. He is very under rated and just plain great. Anyone who is a parent will really love him, as long as you have a good sense of humor."
2,Nothing to see here...move along.,"I read all these reviews and I had to see what the fuss is all about. I got this disc and ""Chewed up"" as they could be purchased for under $20 (gotta love Amazon Prime).Well, as soon as I got them I put them in my laptop and watched them in one go.I have only one word for these: meh.I've seen Jeff Dunham, Pablo Francisco, Ricky Gervais, Ron White (and the rest of Blue Collar dudes) and others and all of them made me laugh far more than Louis C. K. Sorry, he's just not my type. I feel that he's trying too hard to shock the audience by saying things that we find ""socially unacceptable/questionable"" (some of them and to certain degree) but the fact is, his joke's are more thought-provoking than funny. As a comedian he's not so great (IMHO) but as somebody who can make you stop in your tracks and think a bit about how we usually perceive things, yes, he's good at that.Still, I'm not impressed, sorry."
4,Aviation History,In another century another age we forget how far American aviation history and the American military has progressed since the World War I era. Waller creates a vivid picture of the Billy Mitchell trial during the period that gripped the nation. The book provides interesting background on the man who challenged the Washington establishment and gives a view of military policy and capability just before and after World War I. Given the amount and length of the trial material Waller does a good job of presenting the both sides evenly. Mitchell was a compelling but flawed man who argued for an aviation future while living values more akin to his time.
3,"So, so","Its hard to review this book because the subject(Billy Mitchell) was suchan unsympathetic character having been brought up as a child of priviledge in Milwaukee.Its little wonder that he craved for attention so much that he resorted to pissing-offthe superiors as much as he did. Having said that,however, he did force the top army officialsto look harder at the potential of aircraft in a military conflict.Some of his projections, 20 yrs in advance, were ereie especialy when he predicted Japan would attack Haiwaii. Some predictions were very far offbase.Is this book worth the time to read it knowing the final outcome in advance. My answer is no."
5,very good old movie,This doesn't turn up very often on TCM. I found it on Amazon from a seller. It is in very good condition. I am pleased with my purchase.
2,Not THAT great.,"We've had this book since my daughter was just born. I've tried multiple times to get her engaged with this book for the past two years and she just hates it. My daughter loves the most ridiculous books from ""Where the Wild Things Are"" to the whole Biscuit series and all Eric Carle books. In fact, she loves practically all the Robert Lopshire books, but she HATES this one. I can't say that there's anything for her to relate to in this book, which is probably why she doesn't like it. But, I certainly don't think it deserves the 5-star rating it currently has on Amazon."
2,"Kinda dumb, even for a kid's book","I found this book awkward to read and my daughter, although she's a huge book fan, didn't seem particularly entertained by it. The main character doesn't even have a name, so it's hard to talk about what's happening in the book as you read it to your child."
3,1 of the two books I ordered had a defect.,I ordered two of these books for my nephews. one of them had a couple of pages glues together to themselves and I had to cut and reglue it to make it look somewhat normal.
4,Put Me in the Zoo (I can read it all by myself Beginner Books),I am sure it is an excellent book. I purchased this as a gift from recipient's WISH List. She LOVED it.
5,Family Favorite,Purchased for a new great niece so she can enjoy the great story as did my children! Glad for Amazon since we couldn't find it at the store.
5,its one the my favorite books,this is a great book to read and have fun with. Its about a pokedotted bear and his adventrures and its just really funny and fun to read.
3,Review of the Kindle edition,"We downloaded the Kindle version of this book to read with my 2 year old. She seemed to enjoy the story, but I was disappointed with the formatting. The pictures are very small and don't take advantage of the bright colors and great resolution of the Kindle Fire. You can doubleclick to make them larger, but then you can't easily turn the pages. We also tried this on my iPad and had the same problem. This is disappointing because it would be great to have a beautiful digital version of this classic to add to our library. Instead, I don't expect we will read it very often."
4,No Promises in the Wind is a Promising Book,Overall I liked No Promises in the Wind because of the interesting character descriptions and Irene Hunt's excellent writing techniques. The plot was exciting enough to keep my attention until the end when it was far too predictable. I really didn't like the setting either because it was so depressing. i think the book could fairly receive four stars.
2,I did not like the book.,"I think promises in the wind was boring becuase it did not have a lot of details.When we got to the end of the book they should of said what happened to Josh and Janie. Also because they didn't say what happened to Lonnie. But other than that, the book was okay."
2,Ok. Good story line but it had a weak ending,"I liked the beginning but towards the end it just seems she could've made it a bit stronger, maybe even a bit different."
2,Not bad but nowhere near good,It was just to long and boring. I had to read it in school and I just wouldn't recomend this book to ANYONE! Try J.R.R. tolkien or brian jacques for something worth reading.
5,A Favorite,This is one of my favorite novels and I will begin reading it for the 5th time with my class tomorrow. Can't wait!
2,Jonny Ruby,"I thought this book was just okay overall. It was exciting at some parts but then a little boring at others. It takes place in 1933 so it has some things that are not very modern. It is about 3 boys trying to find a job during the Great Depression. They go through some very rough times and need to beg for food and shelter. The author had good, unique vocabulary. They had some good adventures during the story. For me, the ending was a little bit disappointing because i was hoping for something more exciting. I recommend this book to kids in middle school that enjoy a long historic adventure book. I hope they would like it!"
3,I Sort Of Enjoyed this book,This book was good. But some parts were streched out a little. We read this book in class and it took us about two and a half weeks to finish. I would recemend that you read this noval
2,No promises made for No Promises,"No Promises in the Wind was definitely a very well written book. Unfortunately, being an average teenager, I did not enjoy this book at all. It was long and drawn out. Plus, it did not have a decent ending. I recommend this book if you have a lot of free time, but not if you need to choose a good one."
2,An extremely boring book,"""No Promises in the Wind"" was an unrealistic, overextended story that makes regular historical fiction look bad. Its predictable tale about two teens during the Depression seemed to be sculpted out of fluff and too much good luck. The way the two of them always seemed to run into opportunity was annoying after a while, when they found jobs and were able to get food, and I really didn't like the story."
4,No Promises in the Wind- A great book,"I would just like to say that this is one of few books that I really enjoyed and never got tired of. It teaches you about life, and that even though there are lots of twists and turns down the road, you've always got to walk them one day. Also, I never really knew how hard the Great Depression was until I read this book, I thought that this book was very moving and can connect with people about facing there emotions."
5,To the Heart,"The book ""No Promises in the Wind"" was a wonderful book. It kept me reading, wanting to know what would happen next. The Book's true meanings want straight to the heart. The conflicts of Person vs. Person (Father and Son) and both their Person vs. Self inner conflicts kept me interested, and developed the plot nicely. The story revolves around 15-year-old boy named Josh Grondowski. Josh is forced to leave home and support his little brother, his friend Howie, and himself during these hard times. Set in the 1930's, the Great Depression has hit full swing, and Josh is confronted with many challenges. The pain, the suffering, and the hardship of the Depression are really brought out to the reader. The style of writing is down to earth, and you can almost feel Josh's most inner feelings. Over all, if someone knows what life is, the hard feelings and the hard times, readers will really enjoy this novel, and will find themselves sad that it had to come to an end."
3,"Not too Great, Not too Bad","I thought that ""No Promises in the Wind"" was a pretty good book. There were a lot of interesting and entertaining parts. The book kept flowing. There weren't and parts where nothing was happening. I dislike historical fiction but this was an exception. The author had more of a story than a history textbook. The book teaches the reader a lesson. It's just like a fable."
2,Needs more detail!,Well this was a very good book although it could of used more descriptive words or more detail. Like what happened to every one at the end of the book. Did they all live happily ever after or what.
1,No Promises in the Wind,"I disliked the book ""No Promises in the Wind"". It was about two kids, Josh and Joey, as they tried to live off the land during the Great Depression. I think it was way too unrealistic. Two kids who still had a roof over their heads and food to eat during that time period had it good, and would not be so foolish as to run away, even if they didn't like the way their father acted sometimes. It's not just that though. Josh and Joey ran into too much good luck. It seemed that every time they were hungry or in need of a job, something would happen and they would get what they needed. I think it is interesting reading about the Great Depression, but this story is just too unrealistic for that time period."
4,excellent way to learn about Great Depression,I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Learning about history does not come easy for me with textbooks. No Promises in the Wind enabled me to gain a greater understanding of a major event in American history while enjoying the fictitious plot created by Hunt. My only criticism is the lack of an epilogue letting the reader know that Josh and Joey maintained their relationship with Lonnie and Janey.
5,an excellent book,"This is an excellent and well written book. I read this with my 11 year old son and enjoyed it as much as he did. However, he would not have been able to have understood it without my help. He did not know what the depression was prior to reading the book. There were many words and phrases I needed to translate for him. It is not appropriate for sixth graders."
1,"A Slow Moving, Boring Book","No Promises In The Wind contained no promises for an extravagent ending. The slow-moving book based its theme on the depression and told its story of two boys struggling to survive. It dragged from tragedy to tragedy each time with the boys receiving a stroke of luck, with an all too fairy-tale like ending. Unless you have a passion for historical fiction, I wouldn't recommend this book."
1,This was a poorly written book,"This book was horrible. The writing style of the author was not captivating and it left much to be desired. The characters could not be related to and seemed more like figments of the imagination. The horrible style of writing and poorly constructed characters are indicitive of an overall horrible book. Furthermore, I would not recommend this book to anyone, and would strongly suggest you never read this atrocious literary work."
5,Wonderful product,"Amazing blind corner shelf. Easy install. Great instructions. This shelf is like it's floating in the corner of my living room, holding up the 3.5 pound center speaker for our 5.1 surround system. The video instructions are wonderful at the Creative Connectors web site. Highly recommend this product and Creative Connectors."
4,A Nice Corner Shelf,I got this shelf for Christmas and I was able to put it up in about 15 minutes. I wouldn't trust it to hold real heavy things but it works great for my Spider Plant. The mounting design is interesting but if the shelf were to slide out I'd think it would fall pretty easily. This design uses slides where as other corner shelves I've used have snap on rings that hold all sides. 1 star off of 5 stars for the mounts. Instructions were great!
3,Average,"Well, what can I say about this book? To me it seemed just like every other romance novel I've read lately. Hard to believe this is the same author who wrote Dark of the Moon and This Side of Heaven, two of my all time favorites. The plot was predictable and the characters have been done before, many, many times. And is it me, or did this book have way too much in common with Tiger eyes (I think that was the name of it) another of her books? Maybe I'm just burned out on the genre, but I really expected more from Karen Robards."
4,"I liked ""Scandalous"" better","""Irresistable"", the second book in the Banning Sisters trilogy (note: Hey Karen Robards, where's Beth's book?), is a good read, but not as memorable as Scandalous. I am writting this review awhile after reading the book, and frankly, I don't feel like picking it up again and reading it. It was good, but it wasn't fantastic.Clare, the prettiest Banning sister, seems to have kind of a bum rap in this book. She's married to a fink who doesn't really love her, she goes through heck and high water by being kidnapped and such, but in the end ends up with Hugh, a good handsome man.I didn't think there was that much chemistry between the two leads here. Anyone who read ""Scandalous"" with mousy-looking, fire tounged Gabby, and cool, rakish Nick, and is looking for more of the same, will be a bit disappointed.Again, good book, but not really great."
1,Really bad,"This book was much to long in the narrative. There was virtually no dialogue and I didn't read the prior book, but I never felt any of Claires pain from her past.There were moments of hope and I think the plot was good, but it was written with no excitement or feeling.If I read about ""Intimate Congress"" one more time, I was going to rip the pages out. She used that line at least 6 times.I would not recomment this book."
1,Disappointed,I read two - three books a week and have been trying to get past page 65 for over two weeks.
1,very shallow,"I read a large part of the book and then gave up in disgust. Claire is kidnapped and mistreated by Hugh and all she can do is constantly drool over his body. He thinks she is a spy and a slut and he is constantly having a hard time focusing on anything but her body. If you are into sleezy romances and like the ""pirate"" keeps the girl captive thing and they don't know anything except how sexy each other body's look, then I guess this is for you."
3,Second in the series and second to Scandalous,"I picked up IRRESISTIBLE immediately after reading SCANDALOUS. Unfortunately, it wasn't as captivating. The first half of the book takes place in the space of a few hours with a classic case of mistaken identity. The plot itself is exciting, but it seemed to take forever for something to actually happen.IRRESISTABLE focused on Claire; the middle sister and the beauty of the bunch. Claire is all beauty and zero personality. It was because of her meek disposition that I didn't feel much for her or her situation. In contrast, the hero, Hugh, was marvelous. Robards always creates the perfect male character who hardly ever has a flaw. Hugh said and did everything I hoped he would. However, if you've already read SCANDALOUS, you'll find many similarities between Hugh and Nick.There are few surprises in this book. Read SCANDALOUS first...that's the better of the two and a good book even if it stood alone."
4,I loved it!,"Although I haven't read ""Scandalous,"" I enjoyed ""Irresistible"" tremendously. If there's a third book in the ""trilogy"" I haven't yet found it.Although there was much more description than conversation, the plot was magnificent. Even so, there wasn't quite enough description regarding Claire's kidnapping, just a backward look. The story opens after she has already escaped her kidnappers, only to be captured again by others.I'm not a reader who requires that fiction imitate life but rather prefer a GOOD STORY (which is why I adore the Madeleine Brent books), so Claire's adventures made for a great read.Perhaps I should have given it five stars--I really wanted to assign it four-and-a-half--but, in any event, I would recommend this one to anyone who isn't just looking for a fast bit of fluff."
2,Too Long Winded,"I love Karen Robards so when I saw this book I grabbed it quick! But from the moment I started reading I knew this was not one of her better writings. It would take almost 3 pages for someone to say something or for the action to happen. She overly explained things that were not important and wasted time. Robards' previous writings can get exaustive sometimes, but this was the worse. I skimmed over pages until I saw dialogue. And how many times did Claire describe Hugh's ""broad shoulders"". If I heard that one more time I was going to scream! The only reason I endured the book was to find out who was trying to kill Claire and why and even some of that was muddled. Also, some of the old world English terms were downright stupid and confusing."
2,Whoa ...,"Both too much and too little --Too much: cliched characters -- the alpha male turned to mush by love; a heroine too annoyingly cute and too good to be believed; an excessively predictable, very thin plot; the use of every vailable adjective and adverb in the dictionary to describe the main characters and the big sex scene that went on forever and ever; the first scene lasting almost half the book until it got boring, a neverending ""are too/am not"" mistaken identity that could have been cleared up easily had the characters had brains.Too little: plot, plot, plot -- there could have been a number of interesting ways to add substance to this piece of fluff; and though both characters had harsh pasts to overcome, they were drawn in a way too shallow to allow for any depth. It quickly became a tedious read and I skimmed most of it just to get it over with."
4,Solid Work,"Mark Millar's middlegame for the Authority. Nothing short of spectacular work here, and it was nice to see a more consistent use of Frank Quietly's art.This volume is perfect for any fan of Millar's work. Of course, the three stand-alone issues that are included here are nothing great, though the solo-adventure of the Engineer will definitely raise eyebrows. Not for kids."
3,"With superheros like these, who needs villians?","These guys are so violent and fun at the same time that villians have to be the worst [ones] we ever saw. The destruction of New York under a big tidal wave is like a prophetic vision; but in the real world, we didn't have the Authority. Somehow, the dialogue is ironic and full of comments against the government and the people that supports its policies. Liberal bastards, I would call them.Nice moments of enjoyable reading. But don't be shocked for what you see. Reality is way worse."
5,"Sturdy, reliable midi cable","I've used these Proco cables for many years. They are sturdy, reliable and seem to hold up forever -- unlike cheaper cables with molded ends that definitely fail during regular use. These Proco cables have a lifetime warranty for any reason -- even abuse -- but I've never had one fail. For these reasons I think these are the best value too. No one has ever given me a compelling reason to spend more on a MIDI cable (such as the Monster MIDI cables) since they're just transmitting digital data. What advantage would more expensive cables give me, given that these are totally reliable and have a lifetime warranty? Plus, these are one of the few MIDI/DIN cables to have all 5 pins wired, instead of just the 3 needed for MIDI."
5,Reach your full potential by facing your fears,This book gave me the power to drive fear out of my heart so that I could come closer to reaching my full potential.
1,If you market 10 years ago,This industry moves too fast for this book to be relevant in anyway shape or form don’t bother if your looking to expand your reach.
2,Chick Lit,"No way around it, it's chick lit. The only difference is that there are three characters. Of course, they party, one is in a love triangle, and they don't like their jobs at a marketing company. There are several chapters about their jealousy of the other characters and weight issues. If you want something more interesting than reality TV but not too filling, this is it. It's mind candy (definitely not good mental food)."
4,So true,"I loved this book. All three of the main characters (Rhette, Avery and Jen) reminded me of myself and my friends; all unhappy with their miserable jobs, unable or unwilling to play the corporate games to get ahead, and searching for Mr. Right in a frighteningly shallow dating pool. Rhett is trying to plan a wedding that will please her overbearing mother and at times second-guessing the routine of her relationship with her fiancee. Her sister, Jen, is overinduling in both alcohol and men, and not feeling particularly good about either. And Avery is ""dating"" someone online and wondering whether they should meet face to face, while striking up an unlikely friendship with a co-worker. Alan doesn't go over the top trying to get you to laugh, nor does she pull to hard at the heart strings. It's the perfect mixture of hilarity and real laugh to which we can all relate."
4,Perfect game to play on your own,"I purchased this for my 8 year old. It's a great game to keep him busy when he doesn't have company. Nice calm game. Reminds me of Rush Hour, but is simpler."
5,"It's about your life, no matter who you are...","TELL A FRIEND: An easy read, large print and captivating. I Read the novel in 2 1/2 days, and did not want to put it down. It made my laugh, cry and remember all of my human faults. You will see yourself and many of the people you have known. Why? It's about life (unless you have not lived). I look forward to Betty Phillips new book-BRAVO!"
5,From The Heart,"I was literally not able to put this book down. I laughed, I cried, I hoped, I was surprised, and finally I was completely delighted. The book is heartfelt, refreshing, honest, and I wholly recommend it. It's an absolutely GREAT read!"
1,Picture is VERY Misleading,"I bought these bottles for my mom, who has limited vision. I purchased these particular ones because of the picture, which shows the ounces clearly marked in black. When I got the bottles, the ounces are only stamped into the plastic, with no black ink. They are very difficult for even a person with good vision to see. I am very disappointed."
5,Vanity fair,I find this product to be very comfortable . I hjave a hard time finding this kind of product and am very happy with this brand.
5,Love them,"I know that sounds crazy but I have always hunted high and low for these. Even though they are made by Vanity fair, they are still better than their brand. Wear them for a long time... you will get your money's worth.."
3,"Not a Big Difference, but you do see the change.","This worked for a minor change in shading, but to say that it actually whitens, that's not true. As for sensitivity, at times you will feel sensitivity but not like other brands that i've tried. However those other brands have whitened my teeth. By the way I ordered two of these and was charged shipping and handling for separate orders, when they came in the same package. It's worth 99 cents and ended up paying close to $10 for each with shipping and handling."
1,Doesn't Work,"I bought this at the local Dollar Tree after seeing reviews here. I bought 3 packs since it's only a buck each to make sure if I had a bad batch I'd have another to give a good review. This stuff does not work. It's like putting vaseline in your mounth, and tastes about like it too. I continued to use it for 1 week to give it a fair review. It did absolutely nothing in 1 week. Absolutely disgusting, and 0 results. A friend of mine bought some as well near Nashville and had the exact same results I did. Thankfully, it's only a buck each so no big loss, but don't waste your money."
3,Eh,"Tastes funny, lightened? Not really. But I only do this once a day so eh. But I guess it lightened my teeth a little t least."
5,Works great!!!,"I used this only for a couple days, 2-3 times a day for about 5-10mins each time, and I've seen results already! I never thought it would work and It was just a gut feeling purchase because of how cheap it was and I've already tried everything so I said ""ehh, why not"" I came home with total lack of faith and after the first two days I saw visible results. Its tastes as though the same stuff they use on Crest whitestrips but without the price! The only con is that when putting the mouth tray in it sort made my teeth sensitive but I'm known to have sensitive gums and teeth so that may not be a problem for others. Other than that this product blew my mind and I've only been using it a couple days! ""You get what you pay for"" is definatly not the case here!"
3,Its good,I just got this and i used it for the first time. The mouth guard thing is a little bulgy so if you have a small mouth you might want a thinner one and also it doesnt reach all the way to the back of the mouth. When i started reading the reviews for this product some of them talked about how it burned snd sometimes bleached their gums. Well i put a little petroleum jelly on my gums to protect them and i had no burning or bleaching at all. From the first use yes they are whiter than when i started but i dont know if this is as white as they get. I can report back to you guys in a week of using it and then tell you if its a big difference. Oh and i dont smoke. Idk why i put that in but i felt it was necessiary lol. Oh amdi am also really young. I dont know if that factors in to any thing but yeahhh there ya go lol :P
1,junk,well first of the oackage is a plastic bag and so in the mail something bot put ontop of it and the stuff in the tube exploded and it was all over.... well i just pushed all of it to the bottom and cut a hole like im frosting a cake almost lol and used it that way... 5 min my @$$ more like 5 min twice a day til you get your results lol.. it is better off to go to the store and but the 3d whitening strips that they show on tv they work so much better. so do not waste your money. that or if you are that concerened go to your dentist and get a whiteing treatment. lol
3,Color is not what is pictured,"We just purchased three towel racks and a toilet paper holder in the oil rubbed bronze finish and the color is not what is pictured in the photo. The color is much more red, not the dark brown pictured. The quality and style look great otherwise. Very disappointed. We have to send them back because they don't match our other hardware."
2,"Not Good, but...she's still Emma Holly","I am a big Emma Holly fan. Reading one bad book will not deter me from reading her again. And yes this is a bad book. If her name wasn't on the cover I would have thought someone else wrote. It doesn't even fit her style. Its not erotic, its not fast paced. It's a slow torturous read (and not in a good way).I look forward to reading Fairyville. I heard that was old Emma Holly. Hey no one is perfect. If you are a first time Emma Holly reader I DO NOT read this book. You may never read her again and you will be missing out on someone great. Instead read Menage or Personal Assets."
2,Bleh...,"I like Emma Holly erotica. But this book makes me wonder if it's really Emma's. The sex scenes are not interesting and not as hot as in other book. But the thing that trashes this book totally is the main female character. I can't understand her motives. She's cruel bitch. I can't imagine David can forgive her and still loves her as much. I also can't believe she hurt David and Sato badly and still be happy, she doesn't have to do anything to redeem herself. She at least should have done something to show that she's extremely sorry and will never repeat her mistake. Drinnking sake is not exactly something to repair all the hurt she gave David and Sato.In conclusion, try Emma Holly but skip this book. Start with Personal Asset or All U Can Eat."
2,unlikeable heroine,"As an avid Emma Holly fan, I expected great things from this book. Unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The heroine is unlikeable, and that is all that matters to me. I couldn't relate to her, did not understand her motivations, and thought she was selfish and cruel with no real redeeming character traits. The writing was as polished and erotic as all of Holly's work; but if I can't like the protagonist, I can't like the book."
1,What happened to Emma Holly?,"I have read most of Emma Holly books and I just have to say this book is aweful. I can't believe this author, who wrote Menage, wrote this book.I do not suggest anyone to buy this book. I skimmed thru this thing just to be done with it. What a disappointment, especially after everything I did to get a copy of this. :("
1,1 star because no stars is not an option,"I had hopes for this book, it sounded great. But there was nothing there! The woman is a witch with a capitol B; the man is a sniveling wimp and the supporting characters need to be hit upside the head. This book is too raunchy and detached for a romance and not hot enough for an erotica novel.I wonder if there was a book deadline due and the publishers were just too damn clueless to see this as bad.Please give Emma Holly a try; just don't start with this book."
3,Somewhat disappointed in my favorite Black Lace author!,"I really enjoy Emma Holly's Black Lace books, but was somewhat disappointed with ""In The Flesh"". The storyline didn't seem to match up with the synopsis on the book jacket and was confusing in a few places. The sex scenes weren't as hot or varied as her other books."
1,"Hard Setup, No Jabra Headset Support","This phone looks great on paper - but after one week of use, it's shown to be worth returning.1. Base speaker phone hears me great, but volume is so low I can hardly hear the other person.2. Base is cheaply made and slides around on your desk. It has no LCD screen of it's own.3. Setup is truely annoying. Instructions are unclear and in an oddly prioritized. I am in the IT industry. I can't imagine how it must be for someone without experience.4. Extra handsets are weak, expensive and kept"
1,Terrible product shouldn't be sold. Closeout item that doesn't work,Bought through Amazon from Hello Direct. Product doesn't work period. It is a very cheap flimsey phone. On top of that you are not getting what you are paying for. They removed software and USB cables from the box as apparently the product never worked properly. Hello Direct didn't mention this up front. And I had to pay freight to return it. Hello Direct gets zero business from me in the future. If you are selling a stripped product that doesn't function properly you need to tell people that up front. Bluetooth Ha - HA
4,Excellent Phone,This is a great phone with lots of options and is easy to use. Menu-based setup makes it easy to configure. Range is equal to most other 2.4ghz phones and Bluetooth function is simple and effective. You can add up to 4 handsets to the base unit. (I have 3) Calls can be transferred between handsets and handset-to-handset intercom works well. Phones and base unit have USB jacks for connecting to PC for use as modem. Handsets can also be used through USB for Skype or other VoIP services.
1,Constant Echo! Don't Purchase!,"I purchased this phone 2 years ago and tried several times to figure out the echoing when I was on a call! Ourtgoing or incoming-either one! I researched -wanting the best and feel it is the worst of all I have had! The software was useless! All of the things it said it was supposed to do-it didn't do! I packed it away for 1 year and I just got it out again after I had gained computer knowledge, nothing changed! It was not me-it was the phone!"
4,Incredible art,"I saw an exhibit of these almost psychedelic masterpieces in a museum and have been hooked ever since. These paintings are masterful and won't bore you for a moment.I've only read ~15 pages of the text, it's typical for a book like this"
5,Perfect,"This is really a beautiful book. First, the artwork looks excellent. The colors look right, and each image is in nice focus. The pictures are large, but no artwork spans the binding (don't you just hate that?). Each piece that was included in the exhibitions is shown and each piece is given its own short essay. The longer essays are very good too - interesting and not too academic. Includes many wonderful watercolors, too."
4,"Ritter Sport, Fine Extra Dark Chocolate 71% Cocoa, 3.5-Ounce Bars...",We have been buying this product for more than 15 years. I came accustomed of buying it when we periodically visited Germany. I can only recommend it for anyone who likes a pleasant bitter taste in chocolate.
3,why 3 short?,"Of course these are the best chocolates known to man, and this is my second box.At$30 a box...however, why is the box WELL .........not filled? There ""should"" be13 EASILY in these packets. Why only 11? The box hold 13 EASILY, with space left over...so...it's kinda frustrating at the prices. I won't order these again..it's too expensive...unless they FILL the box up.....then I will. :)yummy though."
5,A wise investment for the serious Christian writer,"The Christian Writer's Market Guide by Sally Stuart should be required reading for every potential author and self publisher interested in writing for the Christian market.It is an indispensible tool, and should be on the desk of every serious author. It covers everything from sending query letters to writing Bible tracks and greeting cards in addition to submitting your work to the more conventional publishing houses. It lists support organizations, as well as professional publicists, agents, reviewers, etc.It should be the first investment a writer makes; it's certainly one of the wisest investments a writer could make!"
5,Breathtaking,"Baiev's sincerity and organized writing keeps the reader looking forward to the next page. I read the 350+ page book in 3 days. Just could not stop.His straightforwardness in sharing his experience as a doctor in the genocide promoted by the Russian and Chechen guerilla is breathtaking.I have been shocked by how an atrocity like that might still happen in a so-called developing country such as Russia. It seems that lessons from World War I and II haven't been learnt.I'm shocked too by how our modern world goes blind towards horrors suffered by Chechens, among other peoples. If one reads Baiev's book, Anna Politkovskaya's ""Little Corner of Hell"" and Valery Tishkov's ""Chechnya: Life in a war-torn Society"", one might have an idea of the extent of suffering the Caucasus people have faced. Chechen conflict is not a war between Russians and Chechen rebels. Rather, it is one of a group of unprepared and corrupt armed men (russians and rebels) against humble, poor and unprotected civilians."
5,an excellent book,If you plan on investing your time in reading one book this year make it this one. It is a remarkable tale of an honourable man trying to survive in barbaric times under the tyranny of Putin's Russia. Hassan Biev states that one in every five chechens has been killed as a result of the conflict. However after all this carnage the war stills continues and the state still exits in the hearts of men like Dr. Biev. Perhaps the actions of people like him will ultimately lead to peace in that most violent of places.
5,finally a book by a Chechen,"fantastic book, documents the day to day suffering of the chechen people. heartbreaking and heartwarming........"
3,"Thicker than I expected, with seams, and sock trims show when wearing with loafers","I bought them to use with loafers and the sock trims show (near the heel and on the sides), so I have to find ways to tuck them back in which does not make them as ""invisible"" as I want. They also look thinner on the model's foot, but I do like it being mostly cotton. They actually have seams but you don't really feel them."
5,Excellent Intro to Fatherhood,"My wife had been encouraging me to read about our pregnancy, but nearly everything was too dry. ""My Wife is Pregnant"" caught my attention from the first page and I laughed all the way through sharing the funniest snippets w/ my wife while she read about fetal development, nutrition, and different kinds of strollers.By the end of the book, I had a much better understanding of what was coming, but more importantly, I realized how important it was to do the dry reading too and be a supportive ""part of the team"". I recommend this as a great gift for any pregnant woman to help her guy get w/ the program !"
2,"Good, if you want to waste some time......","Well, just finished all three characters on ""Harbinger"". The game is pretty much a direct port of Diablo, except it's in space. Not worth the price, so DL it. lol.Pretty bad because the AI is hideous, the voice acting is worse, and 85% of the time any ""loot"" you get is for the other two character classes. But it is a good time waster and some of the in-game graphics are actually quite well done.Well, that's my two cents."
2,Not even your average killing machine.,"All in all, Harbinger defines mediocrity and is a great example of a problem in PC gaming today. While the PC is the most powerful of the gaming platforms, many developers and publishers seem more happy to push out rehashes of successful games instead of trying something new and different. In their quest for the almighty dollar, they took shortcuts and ended up with a sub-par game."
3,No game of the year but I finished it,"This is an older game, four or five years now, so it uses the 2-1/2 style graphics. Pretty enough. Until Fallout3, I never liked the 3d rendered graphics of games. It is your typical isometric hack and slash. Someone said Diablo in Space. Yep that is a pretty good translation. You run around and kill stuff. You upgrade your character and equipment. Keep going till the end.I liked it enough to finish it though. I guess I was going through one of those ""I need a pretty brainless game to play"" phases. Not much strategy, not much replayability, but if you are trying to scratch a Dungeon Crawl itch with an alternative visual setting, this would do it.Hail Flavius!"
1,A fine performance ruined by poor recording technique.,"Because of poor placement of a microphone or careless mixing, the harpsichord is faint. Listen to the first cut on the sampler. I have bought hundreds of classical CDs from Amazon. This is the first I have returned. I am sorry for the musicians that a technician ruined their performance, and that helios released such a poor recording."
5,One of the best videos that I have ever seen!,"D.O.A. has got to be one of the best movies ever created! Not only was it beautifully acted by Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan, but it was so intense that there was never a moment where you would consider turning it off. Quaid plays an English professor that has been given a deadly poison that gives him only 24 hours to live. He decides to spend the rest of his time alive finding his killer. From accusing one of his students (Ryan) to thinking that it was another one of his students lovers, it keeps you wondering the entire time who did it. With plenty of action and romance tied into this cunning adventure, you will never regret giving D.O.A. the chance it deserves in your video collection."
3,Interesting remake,If you haven't seen the original version you will enjoy this one. The original one has better atmosphere but this one is not to be ignored. It has a good pace and keeps the viewer interested.
4,D.O.A. [Blu-ray],Not a bad remake ofFilm Noir: D.O.A. Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan turn in good performanaces in this film noir story of a man trying to track down who killed him. Quaid plays a professor that you wouldn't think had any enemies. Somehow he is poisoned and he must try to figure out who did it before he dies. Well worth purchasing. The Blu-ray quality is good and the movie is well worth this price. If you liked this be sure to seeBody Heat [Blu-ray].CA Luster
5,Classic Dennis Quaid,Great film with two great actors. Well worth the price. Had seen it years ago but really couldn't remember much. Kept me on the edge of my seat!
2,Couldn't seem to get through it,"Made in 1988, this seems quite dated now. I paused it a few times, but still could not bother to watch the last half. It's just not that compelling, and Meg Ryan as a college student is just plain ditsy. Take a pass."
2,Not one of megs best!!,"Lots of running around yelling, going nuts. Just very unrealistic. I would never go to see the movie at the theater. She has done much better quality movies. Neither she nor Quaid exhibit any acting talent in this movie"
1,Not formatted to fit,Im having trouble viewing this movie because it doesnt recognize whatever formatt is been done in. I have 2 more devices to try it in before I can say it doesnt work
2,A Parody of the Original,"Unless you've seen the 1947 original, you can't appreciate this imitative parody. In the original film an ordinary man doing his ordinary job gets into a deadly situation. The original film is more credible in its events and characters. It may have been more believable to its audience.This colorful version, whose everyday background contrasts with the original film, lacks the same credibility. While university professors may kill (Eichorn, Kaczynski), it is too much of a fantasy in this fictional example. Dennis Quaid has a little too much energy in him for a dying man.One of the startling events in the original was to have the main character, the hero, die on screen. This was very unusual then, or now. This version could have been taken from MAD magazine."
2,Chaotic and Implausible.,"Viewed: 11/12Rate: 311/12: I looked at the closing credits for D.O.A., and it said it was filmed in Austin, Texas. Not true, it was partly done in San Marcos, Texas, and there was a scene involving that cylindrical bricked building surrounded by a moat. That building is part of Texas State University (formerly Southwest Texas State University). I thought the makers could have filmed more of San Marcos, especially the river. Oh well, back to the film. It just sucked. Meg Ryan proved, again and again, that she can't act. The story was ridiculous. Dennis Quaid could have found a better film to work on. Daniel Stern's presence (or rather the absence) gave the film away for me, and I knew it was going to happen that way because that was probably the only plausible logic possible. Perhaps there was a power struggle between the two directors, resulting in a very chaotic film. All in all, D.O.A. is certainly Dead on Arrival for me."
2,TITLE SUGGESTS ALL,This is a remake of an old black and white film about a poisoned man who learns he has so many hours to live. Like a weird kaleidoscope of action and suspense finally dragged down by it's tiresome lack of identity. I didn't enjoy the original much either.
4,Tender is the Knight,"I think most everyone has said what needs to be said. One thing I didn't like was I would have like for them to get together before the end of the book. I also think Colin was a little too over controlling and he is abusive to her in the way he treats her, not necessarily physically abusive. Then the writer made it so he blames her for everything after he learns the full truth. It was a quick good read that made me want to keep reading, but was still a little disappointed with him blaming her for everything. Thought the writer should have had him begging for her forgiveness. With all that said I still liked the book, but can see why people either really liked it or really hated it."
3,Highlander Jerk gets great woman,"I read Ivies debut novel and was so impressed I bought this one right away. Colin, Duke of MacGowan had no qualities at all. His best quality was he was Scottish and looked great without his clothes. Elise was the star of this book and deserved better. She kept putting up with his verbal abuse and never demanded Colin to say he was sorry for the kidnapping her,stealing her clothes, locking her in a room on a train without a bathroom, never listening to her, calling her a whore etc. No woman should have ended up with him. Ivie needs to improve her male characters. She is awesome creating strong women characters so this book is worth a read just to discover Elise. The only flaw in Elises character was Colin and Colin was a big flaw to this book. Please give us strong men who don't have to abuse women!"
2,"Verra , Verra, Disappointing","What a disappointing follow up after reading Ivies enjoyable debut ""Lady of the Knight"". The story is so fast paced it undermines itself, too many plot lines, (Colin's emotionally explosive, judgemental, barbaric, but meditates and does Tai Chi? AND saves her in full ninja style? In SCOTLAND in the 1800's?) Please! Too much bantering, too heady, his/her love for one another just does not come across with any depth (except for the marriage). Just overkill on all accounts -Verra, verra, disappointing.Check out Susan Carroll's ""The Dark Queen"" trilogy for a more satisfying read.Comment to Jackie Ivie: Please slow down and write with more depth - you obviously have the talent for it."
2,DISAPPOINTING,I WAITED ANXIOUSLY FOR THIS BOOK AND AM TERRIBLY DISAPPOINTED. I AM HALFWAY THROUGH IT AND DON'T LIKE IT. IT IS FAIRLY BORING AND REDUNDANT. THE CHARACTERS AREN'T PARTICULARLY LIKEABLE. IT CERTAINLY ISN'T WORTH FINISHING.
1,Red on handle and base came off with first washing,"After receiving the pitcher and removing it from its packaging, we washed it gently as directed in the included instructions. The red decorative plastic film around the base and on the handle immediately began to flake off."
2,Poor quality-not the true product.,"I truly loved the pitcher when I saw it at a friends home during dinner. This is why I tried to order it online. The product I received was in a damaged box first off. Second, the handle on the pitcher was disproportioned and did not allow for a good grip to pour, Third the spout was not properly formed- it was short and snubbed. Does not allow for a good pour without spilling or over flowing.. If it ha the product that was pictured on the cover it would have been perfect. Was so"
2,the red color is washable,"I liked it,it looks pretty.But only like 2-3times later, when I wash it, the red color on the handle and the bottom happen to fad,when I try to wash it harder,it turns to no color.I'm disappointed."
3,A mixed bag,"I have Magical Holidays, Vol. II and enjoy the wide variety of artists and selections very much! Some uknown (to me) artists like Babyface and Billy Dean, alongside well-known singers like Celine Dion, Vince Gill and Harry Connick, Jr. perform a great variety of standard and lesser-know Holiday selections.Based on that CD I decided to buy Magical Holidays Vol. III. A mistake! Jessica Simpson and Rosie O'Donnell - really??? I should have looked more closely at the list of 'artists' on the CD before ordering it.Some good performances and arrangements, but not worth the time or money."
3,More novelty than psych,"Let's start by saying there are some tracks on this comp that are well worth having and one that I would consider a revelation: Methelinia (or whatever it is) Glows in the Dark. So I'm glad I bought it. That said, there are a lot of songs that sound more like novelties and less like the psychedelic sound of insane Texas bands that you'll find on other comps. Shine Your Monkey could even be considered a predecessor of bubblegum rock. I want to hear Texans on acid shrieking their souls out over savage guitar. This is a bit cute for my tastes."
5,Jimmy Hitch,The hitch was installed without shall we say a hitch.We had to add some washers for spacers but other than that very minor issue this worked well.Added a electrical harness and a 2 inch receiver/ball and we were all set.
2,I guess you could say it works....,"but, it doesn't seem to be a good buy. The capacity is at 61% of the 4400mAh it started with. I got it back in February and it is August 2007. So after 6 months it has lost about half of its capacity charge."
1,Not what it claims,"This book is not what it claims. It contains 3 short stories and a play. It does not even include the title story ""Gifts of the Child Christ"". This was apparently OCRed off an old book, and there are many typos. There is not even a single line between stories and story & play, and there are no headers or footers, so it is difficult to find where they begin. The Table of Contents does not list the individual works, but only ""Part One"" & ""Part Two"". Part Two begins in the middle of a scene in the play, and is an entirely useless division. Nothing good to say about this edition of the great George MacDonald."
4,Real Avengers Fan's this book is a must !,"This Avengers book will remind you of the classic story's that have been followed, by the best Avenging team of Mrs. Peel and John Steed. Follow them as they try to search out the fraudsters at work amongst the presses of the Courier newspaper. The book is a must for Avengers fans it will allow your imagination to follow a classic Avengers adventure. Resulting in your return to the book to keep up with the gripping story. Patrick MacNee thankyou for keeping the Avengers well and truly alive with this book."
3,eehh,"Some of it is good, but some of it is dated material that may have been true at one point but would not be advisable now. I find myself doubting the ""experts"" at times."
4,Enteraining for the right age group,I purchased this for my 10 year old son to listen to in the car. He really liked it although he didn't understand some of the car and motercycle stunts. Now he thinks he knows what to do if he encounters an alligator or shark. Adults may not find it as fasinating.
4,Interesting,A lot of scenarios presented are one in a thousand. But the solutions are clever and simple. Good things to know. Presented in a smart manner.
3,"Brief, relevant information, but don't take it seriously....","This book makes for entertaining reading. The book consists of brief two or three page summaries of how to deal with various incidents. There are decent illustrations and text. I'd expected the text to be light and humorous, but it is very seriously-written. The authorities cited sound impressive, and some of the situations are things that real people SOMEWHERE have to deal with sometimes, even if most of us will never have to face them ourselves. But the book is mainly for fun. Some of the articles scare me: the section on ""how to perform a tracheotomy"" gives a reasonably good summary of the process, but doesn't warn that the carotid arteries are right next to the area you'll be merrily slashing on. And if you cut into the carotid, the person you are helping will be in a very bad situation, even if you do open the airway...."
4,Hilarious!,"I bought this book for my son because it's on his ""wish list."" I laughed so loud in my bathroom that my husband thought I'd won the war with my grey hair again (I pluck them religiously). The book is so funny but matter-of-factly, I couldn't help but making mental notes when I read the section, ""How to land a plane."" Do I feel safer when I travel? You bet!"
3,"Interesting, but too short and thus overpriced","Disregarding the probability of your engagement into those life and death scenarios (unless you are Bond or Bourne), the topics are very interesing. Please read the ""See sample pages"" for a quick look of what those ""tips"" refer to. However, I have a serious complaint about it. There are only 40 ""How to"" in this handy book. For the price of it, 40 more should be included. I didnt suppose to pay nearly fifteen bucks for a book which I could finish within an hour."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed by this book - for example they don't warn you that if you deliver a baby there is a placenta to come out - seems that they just read & spoke situations rather than getting/seeing any practical experience. Thought it would be entertaining, but it wasn't.Don't bother with it, it'll end up in your charity donations pile"
1,COMPLETE JUNK,"These guys have no idea what they're talking about! Like the plane landing scenario--you don't have time to do all the things they tell you to do; YOU'LL BE DEAD! If you're in the line of gunfire from an automatic weapon, you can't run--again, DEAD! And the shark thing, you DO hit them on the nose, it was on Discovery Channel and National Geographic...it's where there sensors are and if you hit a shark there, it will leave you alone. Hitting in the eye will only provoke them. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
2,The Worst Survival Handbook,"A title like ""The Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook"" offers much promise to the reader. But does the book deliver? In a single word: No. And to those who regard the book with humor, and consider it a survival book from hell: You won't find the book interesting, either.And why is that? It is obvious that the book is too superficial to provide any substantial help for the true survivalist. One cannot expect to tackle such serious situations as the ones described in the book by using the overly simplistic and generalized advice the book provides. If that's what you're looking for, then there are plenty of other books that do guide you through these situations well enough.And as for the book being funny to read: It is simply too short to achieve that. It also lacks focus and covers too many subjects, most of which are not the esoteric material that makes for a good joke.I therefore suggest you look for your handbooks elsewhere"
4,enough to fascinate the most reluctant reader,"I am always trying to get my 15-year-old brother-in-law to read more, and though everything I give him usually ends up buried under junk in his room, I thought I'd try again with this. It was a hit! He could not put it down, he kept reading aloud to anyone who would listen, even to his teenage friends who came over. Young teenage boys apparently find it to be very cool--how could they not?Of course, as a teacher myself, I advised him not to take it to school, and told him I'd kill him myself if he got himself hurt trying stuff in the book. But he loved it, read every page, and his parents had to tell him to put it away when he brought it with him to the dinner table!A great gift for any boy over 12 who needs to read more. And who knows, maybe they'll learn something they can use one day!"
3,Entertainment or tool?,"Brutally funny, and often insightful advice for the worst of situations. It managed to both feed my paranoid fears (""I just knew those bees would someday attack me!"") and give me some small comfort in knowing how to survive. Buy two copies of this -- one for the nightstand in your guest room and one for your daypack. In either case it will prove useful and fun reading."
4,Best-Case Coffee-Table Book,"Upon reading the ""Boy Scout"" review, let me say this: I doubt very seriously that more than 1 in 100 readers will ever need to execute ANY of the maneuvers shown in this book. However, this is an EXTREMELY interesting trivia book! It gives advice on interesting situations that I personally have often wondered about--even though I know I will never step into quicksand. Some solutions presented are things I'd NEVER think about, like tapping the croc's snout. I don't think ANY book is without merit (fiction or non-fiction) that gives you new things to think about and know.Also, the book compiles some very good advice for situations that the majority of us MAY need--how to start a fire, how to survive a shark attack, etc. I haven't read the ""Travel"" book yet, but I can only hope that it's as well-prepared as this one.In short, I find this book is an excellent trivia book, a good conversation piece, and overall an interesting and informative book!"
4,Can't get your teen to read?,"This book will surely get them to read! I bought this for my 14 year old son who hates to read and he couldn't put it down! It is a pleasure to see him excited about a book. Although he has not tried anything in this book yet, he was very excited about the information in it."
4,good stuff to know,"this can be considered an excellent bathroom book(its a fast read). its got lots of interesting scenarios..some that one would not normally encounter, like how to escape from the grip of a python or how to wrestle free from an alligator. others are helpful(how to deliver a baby, how to take a punch, how to jump from a moving car, etc) the book is ideal for the outdoor type."
4,Useful? and Funny,"Any schmuck who picks up this book certainly can't be expecting anything but entertainment. But actually, a few of the ideas have a decent chance of being used in my lifetime. It makes for great party conversation. A REALLY useful book I bought this year was The RoMANtic's Guide by Michael Webb. Now that book has tons of stuff you can and SHOULD use."
3,If I want humour I'll buy some Calvin & Hobbes,"As I was reading this book, I was struggling to figure out whether the author intended this to be a survival book or a humour book. After reading it, I still can't figure it out. It's certainly not a survival book, but it is sorta funny...Buy this book for its comic relief, but don't carry it with you when you go camping..."
2,Disappointed,"I am, in one magic word disappointed. I read this ""book"" in a 1/2 hour; it is basicly a picture book. Its extremly basic in information and there are not enough scenarios too read about."
2,"For Humor this gets Four stars, but for Reality only Two","This book is amusing, but at this moment we need to get serious. For that, the King on Survival is the U.S. Army Survival Manual. Get it."
2,Buy only for the humor,"If you think this book can possibly save your life, you are kidding yourself. This book was written as a joke. For example, it gives advice on how to survive attacks by crocks and sharks. It says you should pounce on the nose of crocks and irritate the gills of sharks to free yourself. Now that is funny. It is funnier to see how some of the reviewers of this book think it will actually work! If anyone has been attacked by a crock and was able to free themselves by punching its snout, then please let me know. But I doubt it since they would not have survived."
5,Just hope you don't need this,"While it is unlikely I will ever be in many of the scenerios in this book, it's nice to have the information just in case. It is also very entertaining."
2,Woodstock47,"Some parts of this book were informative, but some just plan got out of hand. I read about two thirds and lost interest."
3,Glad I only spent $1.99 on my Kindle,"I've never had to deal with a python, quicksand, the Arctic, the jungle, bears, etc. so I don't feel there was much helpful in the book. The advice on how to get into a car is vintage 1999 because car alarms, locks, etc. make the suggestions out-of-date. It was helpful to know that if the car is sinking to first open power windows. Other than that, I really didn't find it useful."
2,Obvious/Common Sense,"Okay, so in most worst-case scenarios, the best solutions are through using common sense and basic reasoning. That's exactly what this book tells you. So, the information is probably good, but if you have any sort of common sense, this book will not help you. There was nothing particularly surprising or interesting in the techniques."
5,Awesome!,"This book tells you how to do everything! Break into a car, break down a door, just about everything. It is a MUST for any firefighter, police officer, or anyone else working in public safety."
4,Don't Leave Home Without It,"""The indispensable, indestructible guide for surviving life's sudden turns for the worse. Survival experts provide illustrated, step-by-step instructions on what you need to know fast: how to fend off a shark, how to take a punch, how to deliver a baby in a taxicab, how to survive a poisonous snake attack, how to jump from a moving care, how to identify a bomb, how to escape killer bees, how to survive if your parachute fails to open, and dozens of other dire situations."" What more could you want? Just don't try this at home."
3,The 18th Emergency for Adults,As a child I loved a book by Betsy Bynum entitled The 18th Emergency which offered all sorts of useful information about horrible situations. Just knowing what to do in an extreme scenario feels like insurance against it. All this and a hilarious illustration of frightening a mountain lion.
1,"Especial dissapointment, exceedingly lame.","There is not a single inventive tip or trade secret contained in this book. Every situation's ""solution"" is as boring as you would expect in grade school, from your mother, etc. The typical solution involves 1. Staying calm and 2. Finding help. WOW. What a waste of time.Here's a preview: If you think that you are being followed: 1. Stay calm 2. Don't let your follower know that you are aware of him/her 3. Walk to the nearest police station.You can expect similar excitement from the rest."
2,somewhat lacking,"well, if you like large type and minimal information, this book is for you, but, after all, it didn't cost very much!"
5,Great Fun--Ignore those fools who take it too seriously,"I've given this book to several friends, and they all love it. It's a blast--intellectually stimulating? Maybe not. Practical? Absolutely not. But informative and a great fantasy book? Definitely. Ignore the reviewers who take it too seriously. They don't laugh much. It's a wonderful book for anyone in your life who has ever wondered ""What would I do in that situation?"" And besides--you never know--it may save your life."
4,some grim stuff here,"The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook by Joshua Piven, David Borgenicht is a masterpiece. Each section is filled with knowledge that one hopes they never have need to know. How to survive such gruesome things as bear attacks and getting caught in a crossfire are the typical fare in the chapters of this book. My personal favorite is ""How to survive when your parachute does not open"" (after reading the chapter, I'm not sure I'd want to survive...sounds way too painful). In you want to read a semi-entertaining (all the humor comes from the dire grimness of the situations--which are dealt with in all seriousness) book about surviving in seemingly impossible situations then this is the book for you. I recommend it."
4,Survivalist centerpiece,"I've had this book for two days (finished it a half hour after it was delivered) and though I've not yet had to rely on these instructions to preserve my existence, I have found it useful. By just leaving it exposed on my desk I ensured that curious co-workers would notice it and congregate, affording the office a good half hour of non-productive activity. If you and your significant other are tired of fornicating and have no other mutual interests, let one person read the survival instructions while the other attempts to divine the appropriate survival scenario. The point is that this is a great common-denominator book that will intrigue anyone who has an interest in surviving (though your goth friends could care less)."
5,Buy this book and know how to deliver a baby in a Taxi cab,"So, you're saying ""when will I ever have to deliver a baby in a taxi cab?"" The answer is probably never...BUT think about it...you're sharing a cab with a woman...her water breaks, the baby is on its way...and YOU were too cheap to buy this book. The result: babies start shooting everywhere, the cab driver loses control of the taxi, kaboom, and you gotta clean up. Buy the book and save yourself the trouble."
4,Funny!,"We found this little book in a Cracker Barrell store! We laughed so hard just thumbing through the topics, we just had to buy it. It completely cracks us up. They situations are so hilarious, like how to do a fast 180 turn in your car!"
3,"Funny, but....","This book is good for some laughs, but is NOT a real survival manual. For that, the best by far is the U.S. Army Survival Manual. Check that one out before buying this one."
1,Be careful! You won't land a plane following this advice,"I am alarmed that some readers seem to be taking this book seriously. I am not qualified to comment on most of the other sections but I *do* know how to land small planes and believe me you are not going to land a plane following the instructions here. I hope the rest is better, but I seriously doubt that the authors have any hands on experience.For the record, if you are worried you may have to land a plane one day there is no substitute for a few practical lessons."
3,Funny and Strange Ways to Survive,"In ""The Worst-Case Scenario Survival Handbook"", compilers Joshua Piven and David Borgenicht present a handful of strange and dangerous situations: landing a plane, escaping a mountain lion, jumping from a building into a dumpster, breaking into a car -- all in an entertaining way. Drawing from a list of experts (outlined in the back of the book), the reader can learn all kinds of interesting skills that, in the idea of the compilers, could save your life. I enjoyed the book, and it takes no more than 90 minutes to read. However, some sections were confusing, and some of the illustrations would not help me if I were, say, trying to spin my car to elude pursuers. I hope that I never have to jump from a motorcycle to a moving car -- but at least now I know how to do it should the occasion arise. The book does make you think about our dangerous world, if nothing else."
4,Couldn't Put it Down!,"This little book is so much fun to read I could not put it down. One after another the chapters kept me going. After all, I wanted to be SuperWoman just in case any of these situations should arise. I had always wondered how to performa tracheotomy and now I know how! It's not all that difficult if you have a pen on you:) Some items weren't life-threatening or life-saving, like how to do a wheelie with your car, but all were extremely interesting. What a wonderful conversation piece. Who hasn't wondered about at least some of these situations? I feel much more informed and ready to take on an alligator..."
4,Worst Case Scenario Survival Handbook,"I found the book to be both entertaining and interesting. I like showing it to my friends and see their reactions. Although I will probably never use the information in the book (I'll try not to break into my sister's car just to see), just knowing you could is pretty fun."
5,Useful and incredibly fun,"If you enjoy working with your hands, or imagining yourself in exciting situations, or living life to its fullest, or... Pretty much, if you're human, you'll enjoy this book. I have yet to find someone who did not enjoy hearing how to survive an alligator attack, or how to survive being shot at. You may find people who think they won't enjoy it, but start reading out loud and everyone around you will be hooked. Really useful, but you don't have to buy it for that purpose. A really fun read."
4,Dont leave home without it,"Have you ever been in an aeroplane? You must've read the safety sheet, the laminated piece of paper usually found infront of your seat... Does it make you feel better or worst? That my friend is called paranoia! If there was a piece of paper like that for life then this book would be it! Its all the things you feared and wished never happen to you. But living in fear is not very healthy. If it's one thing this book promotes is keeping your cool even at the worst case scenario. And if you can do that, my son, then you will live a happy life!"
3,"Fun, but too short on content","I enjoy learning about survivalism, so this book immediately attracted me. They cover some good topics, but are far too brief. I feel more familiar with how to do the things mentioned, but I don't feel as though I could actually do any of them. It only took me about two hours to read this book, which makes it much shorter than it should have been. For those interested in this type of thing, I also recommend ""Survival, Evasion, and Escape"", which is a manual produced by the Army."
1,Worst case Senario is reading this drivle,"My worst case scenario, as a former SAR (Search And Rescue) team member, is recovering some poor jerk who had this book in his pack. Hmmm, now why didn't he survive? This book is entertaining, but I'd no more read it for survival information that I'd read the Enquirer for news. Has the author ever tried to punch anything underwater? Not very effective on sharks or anything else for that matter.It is downright dangerous for the person who feels this skimpy book gives him/her the knowledge to survive their way out of a paper bag let alone a real survival situation. The fact that it sells well is an abject lesson in the miracles of marketing and the desire of people to feel secure in their ""knowledge"" without actually doing anything. Being prepared takes effort! Laugh about, joke about it but don't depend on it, as it says on the back "" CAUTION: This book will explode if scanned."""
3,"Light, brief, but on the money","No, this book is not the final authority on survival; and while it is humourous (how many of us expect to be bitten by an alligator?) the information is good - and accurate.Certainly there are more in-depth books (and manuals) on survival. However, the authors have compiled accurate responses on how to survive any number of situations - granted, most of them are far fetched ... but what if? For example, the ""how to preform a tracheotomy"" (more accurately a ""cricothyroidotomy"") is absoutely correct in its explaination and diagrams. Ditto for fractures, frostbite, and snakebites.In the final analysis, lighten up people - being caught in the extreme situations described in the book is outlandish - and therefore the thought of it is funny. But the survival techniques described are the real deal. (Lets hope we don't have to use them.)"
4,Fascinating -- in the abstract,"At last: A ""how-to"" book whose authors specifically tell you NOT to do any of the things they are telling you how to do. There's a legal notice absolving them of liability. Some of the information is potentially dangerous (I'm not sure it's a good idea to be giving amateurs the idea that just anybody can perform a tracheotomy). And some is obvious (If killer bees attack you, run). But it's all compelling and clearly presented. Once I started reading, I found myself thinking that I ""ought"" to know this stuff. One interesting angle on the book is that, although the topics are usually deadly serious, the repeated extreme drama quickly makes it start to read like comedy. A good gift, especially for macho types, armchair quarterbacks, Rambo wannabes and other people who might be hard to buy for."
3,Interesting,I find it amusing in places. A really easy read. Some helpful information. I will know what to do if I am attacked by a bear or have to land a non-commercial plane.
3,Practical advice for unlikely situations,"The book presents 40 situations and how to deal with them - play dead with bears, but do the opposite with mountain lions. All the information is presented in a clear, matter-of-fact way. The writing is earnest and bland and sources are attributed well. Good as a gag gift or a curiosity."
5,Hilarious,"I don't know if these guys were scared of Y2K or not, but this book is a riot. Now if they could only help me survive my in-laws. If you haven't checked out The Romantic's Guide, it is quite humorous and charming too. Actually a bit more helpful."
3,Worst case scenario,"This is interesting. I'v learned some good ideas, if I should ever encounter some of these strange situations. Others are more realistic."
3,"Entertaining, but general","The book is very entertaining, it covers every spectrum of weird scenarios where you might get stranded, although half of them will be highly improbable. The book serves as a guide book on what to do to get to safety or help others in the weird situation. The problem I found is that sometimes the instructions are very shallow or poor illustrated. So don't take it too seriously and by all means don't relay on it."
1,not very good at all,not sure what the point of this book was ... not enough details were included to make it at all interesting
2,Boring,No wonderous insights here. Any fool with ten cents worth of family camping experience could provide more insightful and more helpful hints. A waste of time for the writer and a severe waste to the reader.
4,Perfect 'guy' gift. Very fun read.,"I got this out of pure curiosity and wasn't disappointed. The book clearly details how to do and survive some of the most interesting situations, many of which you have a chance to actually find yourself in. How to get out of the line of gunfire either as the target or as a bystander, how to escape from a car sinking in water, and many others. I ended up buying three more copies for my buddies for Christmas."
4,Very pleasing and amusing....,"Every person who has come into my dorm room today (Penn State University) has sat and read this book with delight. It is very handy if you ever get stuck in a crazy situation, I enjoyed the ""How to Land a Plane"" scenario. The wilderness skills are also very relevant and useful. Everyone has gotten a kick out of it, and a friend of mine even went out and bought his own copy. It was worth the money spent, which wasn't much, and will be a conversation piece for years to come."
3,More fun that useful,"Honestly, what are the odds, right? I think some of the entries are more likely to be useful than others.Delivering a baby in a taxicab (or anywhere for that matter) might have come in handy when my friend refused to go to the hospital without her husband, who was stuck in a huge traffic jam.The scuba diving part, you should already know if you're scuba diving, and if you don't know, chances are the book is not going to be handy.All in all, it makes for fun reading."
3,Right next to the Bathroom Trivia,"Eh, its okay. I think I read it in about 20 minutes. There was like one thing I hadn't thought of before. The rest of the scenarios were your pretty basic cliff hanger survival stuff. The nice thing is the actions described seemed pretty correct. Couple things stand out, when I'm chased by killer bees I WON'T jump in water, ( Don't know when I'll get attacked by killer bees but Hey ya never know!)All in all, I was curious, I bought it, I enjoyed it for about 15 minutes an now I'm over it."
3,Good for a Gag but not Real,"This book is only for laughs. For REAL survival information, nothing matches the US Army Survival Manual."
1,just enough to be dangerous,Irresponsible. Promoting surviving anything in a few paragraphs of information is a set up for leaving the gene pool at an accelerated rate. Common sense and real life emergency scenarios have proven this for decades. Fun for the coffee table and wannabe only.
1,Not usable without the book,I purchased two of these and I don't remember the word workbook mentioned in the advertisement because I thought I coulduse these with my students. They were both unusable but it cost more for the postage to get them and return than it did for the cost of the book so I just threw them out. I will be very careful about purchasing anything again from either of these buyers if they don't give proper titles. I thought I was getting the book not the workbook.
1,Classic songs performed by a $20.00 Yamaha keyboard.,"I like Motown, and I've heard most of these songs before- but never like this. Have you ever played on a toy keyboard? One of those $20.00 Yamaha keyboards for children? Remember how you can pick different instruments (horn, drum, flute, piano) and the keyboard with synthesize them? That's what this sounds like. I don't know if the original songs where just digitally processed to death, or if a new, electronically created music track was created and matched with over-processed vocals, but the result is horrible. I'm not an audiophile or music snob, so let me be clear- I'm not just turning my nose up because of a little digital processing. We're talking about Motown as performed by a computer. No thanks."
5,Straight from the horse's mouth!,"The thing about Elvis is he never wrote an autobiography, so for too long ""the real"" Elvis had to be revealed by ""those who knew him.""Finally here's a comprehensive collection of things Elvis really said.In this book are transcriptions of press conferences, concerts, and letters.The biggest thrill for me was the publication of the letters Elvis wrote Anita Wood while he was in the Army. As far as I know, she hasn't allowed them to be shown previously (in the P.S.'s Elvis tells her to never show them to anyone)."
4,Remake of other books,"I bought Elvis Word for Word in hopes of getting a somewhat personal insight into Mr. Presley's ambitions and desires in life other than performing. I felt this book made him seem somewhat out of it during his last few years of performing. The book made him seemed like a lonely, angry soul looking for a way out."
2,You have to listen hard to find the pianos!,"This is not their best. Maybe the addage ""you get what you pay for"" applies. This CD LEAVES me disappointed. Then again, as background music at work, I hardly notice it. I doubt I will play it often."
3,"This is NOT ""The F & T Orchestra""","After their 1960 launch to fame with two back-to-back million selling movie themes....ABC Records and Columbia (Sony) scrambled to their vaults to ride F & T's high flying success via F & T's less successful 1950's recordings. These 1950's recordings DID NOT HAVE AN ORCHESTRA. These were ""piano solos.""The record companies hired some really no-name arangers to ""fill in"" orchestral backdrops--their new trademark. The entire orchestra is strictly ""dubbed"" in behind the pianos...creating one of the most horrifc sounds ever known. So horrified were Mr. Ferrante & Mr. Teicher that they legally imposed a ban on future releases of this material. Every once in a while one slips through the cracks....this really bad Autumn Leaves is a perfect example. Try to find F & T's original piano tracks and you'll find shear heaven!"
5,children of all ages will get just what they need from this,"This is a great, almost un American book in that kids are told that it's OK, even wonderful and wondrous to be science geeks, be curious. Love the Frizz when she says ""take chances, get messy, make mistakes,"" and encourages her students to explore. In a society that elevates sports and violence for boys, and beauty and cattiness for girls, this series stands out for encouraging gender neutral intellectualism and academic achievement. My geeky 5 year old can't get enough, having finally found fictional characters that reflect her and encourage her. Factual substance-wise, I as a 40 year old have learned tons."
3,While I usually like Magic School Bus books; not this one!,"There are so many ""info-narrative"" books about dinosaurs for children I was disappointed in this one. I am sorry to be the dissenting opinion but I am not impressed with this book. I would use a different book."
2,ONE BAD APPLEton can spoil the whole record deal!,Cute pop fluff with nothing truly ground breaking. Not that there is anything wrong with that sort of product but there really is far better produced product currently available on the market ready for mass consumption.
5,Wonderful starter train for your toddler!,"My son received this train when he was 16 months old, he is now 23 months old. I cannot believe how much he STILL adores this simple, yet adorable train set. Almost every other day he reaches into the closet to grab the box out so he can play with it. He loves to set it up & take it apart as well. This would make a great gift to any child who is old enough for their 1st train set. I've since purchased additional ""add ons"" from the Brio line. My son loves the steam locomotive with lights & sounds. He also loves the tunnel the train goes through. We definitely prefer this BRIO battery operated 1st train set over the plain one. Beautifully made & will last forever, my 2nd son who is only 6 months old will surely enjoy this as well someday. A great purchase that continues to keep my son entertained!"
4,A sure hit,"Our 9 month old has loved this book from the very first day he started chewing on it! He loves the familiar faces and enjoys holding the book and flipping the pages around all by himself. It's a chunky board book so it doesn't get damaged (even with constant tastings), and he always comes back to it even when surrounded by other newer books and toys. The only drawback is that some of the faces are hard to explain to a child (like ""sour face""), but for the most part he doesn't seem to mind the content and LOVES the actual faces. I definately recommend this as part of any baby's collection."
1,Playing Card Holders - Handheld - set of 4,I actually got rid of them. I bought them for my mother who has familial tremor. I thought they would help her hold the cards. It was difficult for me to get the cards into them. My mom could not use them.
2,card holders,the card holders don't hold cards as well as I thought. Its almost as though they are too loose.
3,Card holders,I ordered these for my mother-in-law that is in a retirement home and spends a lot of time playing cards. She is pleased with the quality.
3,Not what I thought they'd be...,I was a little disappointed with my purchase. I thought I was buying the old style card holder with a button in the middle. These are very cheap plastic with two pieces of foam in the middle. The pressure of you holding the disc keeps the cards in place...not the button and the spring that I remember. These are NOT like what Grandma had us playing with.
3,Not exactly a switch but it should do the job.,"This turned out to be a box with 2 double pole circuit breakers and a ground bar. The breakers are head to head in the middle of the box, just like a normal panel. The switch part is a metal gizmo which sits on top of the circuit breakers between their levers. With the panel cover installed, the gizmo is floating between the breaker levers and prevents both from being on at the same time. When you push one on if the other is on it will be pushed off.The knockouts on the box are relatively difficult to knock out but you don't have to do very many."
2,Disappointed,"As others have noted, this is just a CH panel with the bridge between breakers on the cover cut out (not cleanly either) and an interlock added. I would love to see just the interlock made available so you could use it on an existing CH panel. It is the most affordable option I saw given the requirement of a stand alone transfer switch though I'm sure there are cheaper / better options out there if you look."
3,should work,"the one I ordered came with a 60-amp on both sides. but it was discounted. it will only turn off the common wires, not the neutral or ground."
5,Single Load Transfer Switch,"I used this instead of the usual transfer setup because my main electrical panel is so crowded. When the switch is thrown, this unit transfers a small sub-panel (8-circuits) away from the main electric panel and connects the sub-panel to my 5500 watt backup generator. Have used it one time so far and everything worked perfectly."
5,"Well built, and not complicated.","Great transfer switch.Very simple, no-nonsense design.Installation instructions are sparse....leaves it to the installing technician to figure out. But then again, installation varies depending on local code requirements, so I suppose that is acceptable."
1,Zumba Advanced Workout DVD,"The content is appropriate to advanced Zumba workouts. The DVD itself arrived in terrible condition. Not even the first couple minutes into it, there were multiple skips and stops. This is the last time that I will purchase a DVD online."
1,Terrible,"Not what I expected from Amazon.com. The DVD was very poor quality, and it wasn't really Zumba it was someones interpetation of Zumba."
3,Buy the set,"Rather than buy one Zumba Fitness DVD, it is better and cheaper to buy the 4-DVD boxed set. You won't get bored and you will work different body groups to different music."
1,Dissatisfied!,This was advertised as new but was not. I am waiting for directions for return of item and refund of payment.This was going to be a gift and an open item is not an acceptable gift.Where do I send it back to????
1,Boot leg dvd,"Not sure what I got, but it looks fake, awful sound, and poor quality product. It is very disappointing. I spent about $35.00 for it, and was expecting better quality. I am returning it today."
4,I do it everyday,"I love this video, it's quick and easy, I can get my workout done in 35 minutes and I feel like I've gotten a really good sweat out of it. I'm not the type to spend hours and hours working out, so this is perfect for me. The moves are easy to learn."
2,Only half hour workout.,I am going to take instructor training so thought I'd see ;how advanced I am. I was able to do the workout no problem. However it was only a half hour and I usually dance for an hour.
2,zumba advanced dvd,Never received it nor no explanation! I ordered this along with two other zumba dvds and received those quickly but this one never arrived!
5,Zumba Advanced Workout Dvd,Our Employees feel this video is Great! They love the workout they get. The music is entertaining and uplifting. This motivates them to stay after work and work on their fitness levels.
1,just alot of HYPE!!!!,What a let down! You won't find a terrific workout here.... just a lot of HYPE!
3,Eh.,"My mom bought this a few years ago. I thought it was fun, and I lost a few pounds BUT I got bored. I was doing the advance work out and it just seemed a little dull, not only that some of the back up dancers messed up which was hilarious. I was doing the same work out over and over again I memorized the lines Beto said! Anywho, it's a good work out but its boring."
1,Spanish,"I received the product timely but the instructions were in both Spanish and English. If that was in the product description, I missed it. At any rate, I didn't like the fast pace of the video and I don't like spanish instructions mingled in."
3,Not overly impressed,"I have been doing the Zumba series at my church and really love it. We do the newer collection cardio sculpt & tone, express workout. Most of the steps are shown in an easy breakdown format. The soundtrack is awesome,really gets you moving. When I purchased this advanced Zumba I thought it would be just like the one I did in class. However, it was not. There is very minimal English instructions.It's mostly Spanish. The dancers are scantily clad like another review stated.The soundtrack not so hot.(and voices are not clear).It reminds me of a bootleg copy. The moves are advanced, some I could not do(I know It is advanced Zumba).I really recommend getting the beginners from the same series. Don't be like me and assume you'll jump right in full swing. I must say I am not the avid dancer, nor the most coordinated person so maybe it's just me."
4,zumba is fun,"yes, the girls are wearing little clothes and they dont explain the steps great, but once u get the steps if u move ur hips and try to do what they are doing it really is a good work out. to the person who wrote that they don't even sweat from this video, u must not be trying. if u actually get into it and move like them its a great workout. i am into fitness i do 4 classes a week for the past year, kickboxing, bootcamp, lifting weights and spinning (bycicle) and this dance makes me feel like im working out just as hard."
3,Get the Four-DVD Set Instead,"This only contains one DVD. The Zumba Fitness set has four, which is a much better value. This DVD is the same as the one in the Fitness set. It's a good work-out, just not very cost-effective."
2,Advanced Zumba,I was very disappointed that this is in spanish (of which I have no knowledge). The only way to follow along is to watch several times to memorize what they are doing. It is frustrating. I would not have ordered this if I would have known.
1,Like new Zumba DVD,"The DVD said it was ""like new"". However, it does have some places where it stops for a moment, then proceeds. I'm not a fan of the leaders first giving directions in Spanish, then in English. The music in the background has much less volume than the leaders. So in order to enjoy/hear the music so you can have fun dancing, you have to turn it up really loud, in turn the leaders are loud."
5,Chocolate Bar takes the cake,"This a great combination coffee table book/cookbook. I bought a copy for myself and have made the peanut butter cupcakes (delish and ended up looking exactly as they do in the photo), as well as the red velvet cake which my mid-Westerner boyfriend devoured. I also picked up a copy for my best friend's birthday. She's not as experienced in baking as I am, but she found the recipes easy to follow, and the drink recipes mouth-wateringly luscious.As a design-freak, I love the graphic design and the photos. They authors also give great advice about presentation for all of the recipes-something that is oft overlooked. And hey, who doesn't like chocolate?"
3,"Nice, but Out-dated","This is a nice book, with detailed information, however is very (VERY) out-dated and much of it does not cover the new Incra jigs & all their features."
1,Faconnable,"This product was ordered as a gift. I was greatly disappointed when it arrived in damaged condition, and I had to purchase a different gift at the last minute."
4,Purrfect for picky eaters,"If you are looking for a cat food that is ""ground"" meat and is fairly moist, this is it. Mine want a ground food and this works. It is a strong smelling food. What do you expect from shrimp and tuna. lol.A little hint for leftovers or for finiky eaters. Spoon a little onto a plate and warm it for about 9 seconds in the microwave and then stir it back into the can. It releases the smell and softens it even more.Prices have gone up a bit since I bought it, but what hasn't. There were some cans dented and both Natural Balance and Pet Pharmacy stood behind the product and took care of things. I was very impressed."
4,Great case. Only one or two small problems,The trombone that I put into this case is a Conn 112H.The case is fantastic. It is well constructed and pretty easy on the eyes. My only concerns are that getting the bell section into the case is kind of a pain as the velcro straps are mounted beneath it. Another concern is that my second trigger comes quite close to the slide section and I am worried that too much movement will cause it to scratch and damage the slide. My last concern which is more of a personal one is that the storage pocket on the outside of the case is not large enough for a regular piece of paper (sheet of music).I would definitely recommend this case to someone else.
2,"Not sucked in to this ""Portal""","Very amateurish. From the first few pages you got the sense the author doesn't have a grasp on reality or believable characters - his antihero is a nerdy guy but the beautiful, smart and sweet cheerleader is interested in him. Riiight. Then he's a scientist, but ""people said he looked more like a rock star than a scientist. But he didn't care what people thought."" How delusional! He becomes obsessed with going back to high school and winning the cheerleader, but who cares. There's one kind of good scenario in which he is fired by his boss and makes an impossible threat and then uses the time machine to make it happen. But as the timeline changes problems arise that one can see coming around Fifth Avenue."
2,Beware : No Tritnite luminous-tipped stick markers and baton hands,"Buyer beware : contrary to description, this watch (and a whole Slim line like 3423) DOES NOT have Tritnite luminous-tipped stick markers and baton hands as description said. So that, it's not visible in the dark at allI bought this watch and I thought it was a manufacturer defect. Then I called Invicta customer service and the agent approved that this line of watches (Men's II collection Extra Slim) indeed doesn't have Tritnite.Since the ability to see time in the dark was important for me , I returned the watch. It's a pity because the watch is indeed slim and nicely designed.Hopefully Amazon will fix the description."
3,Incompetent Publishing,"My rating of 3 stars (above) is a lie, since I never read the book. I never readthe book because it's printed without capitals, in densely packed type, and isvery difficult to read. I enjoyed Altsheler as a boy , and hoped to givethe book and other Altsheler adventures as a gift to a teen-ager. Butit would be unfair to foist this poor edition onto a youngster just beginninghis serious reading life. It's not e e cummings poetry; it's not great literature.What on earth possessed Valde Books to eschew capitals?Parsimony? Cost-cutting? Whatever, it cost them my order(s)."
5,Inspiring story / Amazing adventure / Great read,"The Rugged Road is an amazing story about two women who pushed back on the walls their world tried to enforce on them. Written by Theresa Wallach, she and her then friend Florence Blenkiron wrote a Panther motorcycle and side car from London to Cape Town, South Africa. In 1934!!! They became the first people ever (men or women) to cross the Sahara on a motorcycle and this was at a time when women had only had the right to vote for a decade.Getting a send off by Lady Astor herself. Incredible story and really fun to read for anyone looking for a little adventure, travel, inspirational tale that reminds us that you can do great things no matter the time or place."
2,"Not effective, hair gets stuck in.",I tried them on a trip to Europe. They didn't work. I couldn't get them to seal out the noise and my hair got stuck in them and pulled. I ended up using my mp3 player to drown out noise.
1,there are better options out there,"in my humble & limited experience, I was not impressed with them:1) they do not stay in my ear2) in order to get them to seal, one has to put some pressure on it, which causes discomfort in the earI found myself abandoning these after just 2 swims b/c I spent the whole time trying to get them to stay in. For an alternative, cMack's AquaBlock Earplugs, 2 prheck out the AquaBlock ear plugs, also from Mack. I had much better success with them."
1,"Forget it..... Not worth the money""",Product is a pain to use. Much better products on the market. Take a pass!!!!!!!
2,Fun for a boy or a girl....or not.,"These make excellent play-doh for your little neices and nephews but as earplugs I found them bitterly disappointing. As bitterly disappointing as an earplug can be, that is. Yes, they are soft and can conform to the interior of your ear, but all they do is muffle sound; in no way did they drown out the annoying cacophony of my neighbor who likes to start his parties at one in the morning. Perhaps they are better for higher-pitched sounds that don't have much bass in them, but they didn't save me any sleep."
2,Meh...,These earplugs barely block out sound. They hurt and fall out way to easily when sleeping. Unreusable. I don't recommend.
1,Didnt wortk for me Not good,I bought them thinking would silence alot of noise. You will see it doesnt. Not good ear plugsunless you want just a little noise out. I thought they were like wax ones
2,Not impressed,"I have been a long time Mack's earplug user, love the little blue/green foam plugs. I tried this kind because the store that I usually bought the other kind from quit carrying them. I figured that since I liked the other kind in this same brand that I would most likely like these as well...not so much. I ended up just using these for five nights. Every single night, one or both would fall out of my ear(s). I cleaned my hands before putting them in and I cleaned my ears, it didn't make a bit of difference. I would never buy these again, I ended up finding an online store that sold the other kind, the kind that I love."
1,hate them!,"This are horrible earplugs, they are so sticky and big...they don't really protect you from the noise and are extremely uncomfortable."
5,Works Great,I think they work better then regular ear plugs. Only down side is everything sticks to them. I work nights so these help drown out the noisy neighbors.
3,"They're Okay, But There Are Probably Better Ones Out There",PROS1) They work fine if used properly.2) They are probably more safe than the regular earplugs. These do not go inside your ear canal.CONS1) They are not too easy to put on your ear.2) You may slightly hurt your ear while pressing the silicone toward your head.3) There should be better earplugs out there that block the sound more effectively.
2,Disappointing,"I had high hopes for these earplugs - they did not do anything. Macks foam ear plugs are much better, once you master inserting them in your ear."
2,not what I'd hoped,"I was impressed by the reviews for this product, but I have been very disappointed. The earplugs block barely any noise at all--with them in I can still hear people talking on the street (and I live on the third floor), my roommate closing a dresser drawer, and other small noises of the type that should be completely blocked out. I cannot imagine them working at all for louder noises like snoring. The only reason I gave them two stars is that they do block the high pitched hum of the fridge. And, there is no danger of oversleeping when wearing these earplugs--you'll definitely hear your alarm."
5,Thank goodness for these things!,"My husband's snoring is atrocious. He's also 6'8"" tall so he doesn't fit on the couch. On a good night, I get about 5 hours of sleep. I lay there and loathe him because he's sleeping soundly and I'm awake because of his sleeping. I bought these earplugs yesterday and these things are a GOD SEND. I tried the memory foam ones and they hurt my ears like crazy and I didn't think they would stay in very well. Mack's form to your ears, they stayed in all night, and I actually slept for a solid 8 hours. I could still hear the snoring, but it sounded distant and peaceful, nothing like the VUVUZELA I was used to sleeping with. I can see how they wouldn't last very long but even though I'm not made of money, I will GLADLY pay $6 every two weeks to sleep through every night! I felt great this morning and I wanted to hug my husband instead of slap him."
2,"Affective, but potentially dangerous.","I used these guys as an alternative to the foam kind hoping to get something that would be more effective in blocking sound. That they were. The plugs did a great job blocking sound and are also a smart idea for blocking water in a pool when swimming, another reason I picked them up. While I wouldn't say that they can NEVER be worn safely, I would NOT suggest using them as a sleeping aid.I put them on the first night for the initial reason I purchased them; to block out the incessant barking coming from the next-door neighbor's full-sized standard poodle. The poodle did not wake me up that night. However the earplugs did, or rather the pain they were causing. The earplugs created a vacuum in my ear canal, causing a painful suction. This perpetuated an ear ache that lasted 2 full weeks. Whether it did irreparable harm to my hearing is yet to be seen but needless to say I won't be using them again.If you do buy them, please use them with care."
3,I didn'r really care for these,I didn't really care for these wax earplugs when compared to the foam alternatives. I ordered both types at the same time to help me sleep (my wife is a snorer. The foam versions blocked more noise and didn't leave me with an oily feeling inside my ears.
2,"Good, see - but not good enough.","As with one of the other reviewers, my significant other snores like a tank. These bad boys are okay - not sticky enough to get a good seal - but if you combine them with a used foam earplug, they work well enough. I'd not get them again in the grand scheme of things; but I'd definatly save these for sleeping on planes - from what I could, and couldnt hear with them in, they would be ideal"
4,Has helped with my sleep!,"I'd wake up around 7AM each morning due to noise, but these plugs have helped me for the most part, on the first use they work well & noise is reduced drastically but from the 2nd use & onward they begin to deteriorate & aren't able to block out noise as easily.Either way i've been sleeping much better these past couple of weeks."
5,great plugs,The plugs are great. They do not fall off and they are easy to handle. I am very happy with the purchase
2,There are better on the market,"I am a light sleeper and have been using these earplugs for years because they were the best I could find in the stores. I recently discovered Physician's Choice Silicone Ear Putty and wow, what a difference. Mack's will do in a pinch and they block out noise just fine. But, as one reviewer noted, they tend to fall out unless you put pressure on them and practically push them in your ear canal AND they are only reusable for about 2 nights. I haven't had either of these problems with PC Ear Putty so I am making the switch permanently."
2,"Poor earplugs, look for better ones","I am a regular swimmer, I swim 6 days a week. I have tried many earplugs: mack's pillow soft ear plugs,mack's aquablock ear plug, howard leight aquaseal ear plug, and arena ergo liquid silicone ear plug. In the beginning, I used mack's pillow soft ear plugs, but then after 3 days, it would start leaking water into my ear. So I switched to mack's aquablock ear plug, still does't fit, water leaks in. Then I tried arena ergo, I figure since it's the most expensive swimming earplug on amazon, it must worth a try. It turns out hurts my ear, I couldn't even fit it in. $16 down the drain. Finally I tried howard leight aquaseal ear plug, WOW, waht a difference, perfect fit, never leaks. I am so happy. I am never going back to other brands again."
4,Live is almost always better for bagpipes,"I recently purchased this album, as opposed to any of the other Wicked Tinkers albums, because this one consists solely of live recordings. I have consistently been disappointed by studio recordings of traditional Irish/Scottish music because there just always seems to be something lacking, and this album solves that problem by being all live.This album is lively, entertaining, and the inclusion of the didgeridoo and brass horn add a haunting, compelling note that is sure to shoot right through you.A good choice for inclusion in the collection of any fan of traditional and neo-traditional Irish/Scottish music."
5,My kids are hooked on this band!,"My family saw this band play live at the Pleasanton Highland Games, where they were incredibly energetic and fun to watch. Something like a bagpipe jazz combo. This CD does a good job of capturing some of that energy (though you should try to catch them in the flesh if they ever play in your neighborhood!). My kids are simply hooked on this music. They can't stop twirling and stomping to it, and my older one has declared that she wants to learn the bagpipes! Beware - this music needs to be played LOUD. You may scare the neighbors. Just fab."
5,Get your Irish on!,"Highly energetic, really entertaining group. Love the blend of Celtic traditions. This had made me a fan of the group."
5,We Use This Book For Pre-Remarriage Counseling,"Our church staff uses this book for all our pre-remarriage counseling. We use it because it's readable; if our clients don't actually read the books we give them, it doesn't really matter how 'right-on' the advice might be. This is not a clinical or technical book --- this book is full of real-life stories, examples, illustrations, ideas and yes -- failures --- that grow out of personal experience in the early 21st century. If you are thinking about getting remarried, sit down and read this book together. You will learn a lot."
5,A SHOWCASE OF TALENTS,"In this one little four song single, Manson manages to showcase a lot of different things. It shows his ability to write a great heavy song and a great quiet song. It shows he has talent at remixing, doing cover songs, and making making awesome music videos. This has it all. It has his two best songs and the videos to go along with them. THE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE should be in every hardcore Manson fan's collection."
5,MM fan,"What can I say? Thanks to Amazon, my Marilyn Manson CD collection has grown twofold. If you're a fan, don't hesitate to get these singles and rare items."
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is not only an awesome song, but the Enhance CD makes it even better!!!!!! Manson ROCKS!!!!!!! Long live the King of Metal!!!!!!!!!"
2,Expected witnessing to hardened criminals.,From the dvd description I expected the dvd to be about their adventure into the jungle & changing criminals lives.They showed the guys witnessing to I think two people . It shouldve been combined with other video segments & refocused. I do love their missions though & their hearts.
5,The Source,This provides us with a first-hand testimony on the war on drugs in South America and shows how the Christian message can reach out and touch peoples lives.
1,Early example of National Socialist rhetoric,"Dr Ewald Banse, an obscure professor at Brunswick Technical College in the 1930s, caused no little controversy in February 1934 with the publication of this book. This book was originally published in Germany under the title of ""Raum und Volk in Weltkriege"" in November 1932.In this book, Banse essays that Germany would need to invade Great Britain, and advocates Bacterialogical warfare and selective eugenic bredding as the way to achieve this.A chilling precursor to the Nazi atrocities, Banse also advocates the the destruction via military means of Great Britain.Originally German authorities tried to have the translation of this book book banned, as the german edition had already created a diplomatic incident.Dated, but of interest to the political and social historians oof the 30s, this book is of only moderate interest to those interested in hypothetical invasions of Britain."
2,disappointing,1. TOO HEAVY (heavier than two VICTORINOX knives)2. CHEAP MATERIALS (which made the weight heavier and poor quality)3. BIG4. HARD TO PULL OUT THE TOOLS (it's too tight so that ALL tools are hard to open althoug I lubricate)
4,This is what I wanted.....,"I just got my Juice Xe6 and so far it is awesome. I have not got a chance to use it on anything but the quality and feel of the blades surpasses anything I have owned in the past. I have had quite a few pocket knifes and other tools but nothing like this. I really wanted the Diamond file and the awl, (never know when you need to file something or untie a knot...) I can't wait to try out the cork screw!!!"
2,Not What It's Cut Out To Be,"I'm not sure exactly what nitch this particular tool is supposed to fill, but I do know that, for me at least, it's just not what I was looking for. In the first place, it's advertised as a ""pocket"" tool, but the old LM-1 or the PST are both thinner, more comfortable to carry in a pocket, and their jaws open much wider, making them more useful for more things. Also, as has been mentioned before, the quality of workmanship that I have grown to expect from Leatherman products just isn't there. Another thing is. I DON'T LIKE the little notches at the ends of the blades meant for opening. If your nails are too short or too brittle, they will break before ever moving the blades. I've owned, used, and enjoyed, the Leatherman LM-1, the PST, the Supertool, and the Wave, all excellent tools, and I would recommend them highly anytime. The Juice series, however, just don't get the job done."
4,Slightly dissappointing,"I bought this when my 15 years old Leatherman tool was lost last year, and unfortunately the quality has deteriorated. I haven't experienced any problems with it (yet?), but it doesn't feel as well crafted as the old tool. The tools aren't as tight and well fitted as they used to be. Especially the scissors feel like they could fall apart any time. I understand that Leatherman needs to keep the price down, but I would pay more for that feeling of superb quality (you still get that with Victorinox pocket knives).Apart from that, the choice of tools is excellent, sharp knife, effective saw and good pliers (the reason I chose this over Victorinox). And the corkscrew has come in handy more often than I expected. Also, the size is perfect and it lies well in the hand. I've read complaints about difficult to open tools, but I haven't had any trouble with this myself."
5,Excellent Tool,"Maybe the only true multi-tools with a corkscrew (Gerber had one that was discontinued). It was one of the only tools I was able to bring when I lived and traveled abroad for a year. It's been used to repair computers, fix furniture, hammer ice off a frozen fridge. Yeah, and open a lot of corks and bottles too :-)Downsides to watch out for:1. it is easy to pinch your hand using the pliers2. the bottle opener ""hyper-extends"" on mine after years of abuseIf you don't need the corkscrew, and use the pliers a lot, I'd look at a bigger tool. If you're a traveler or camper, or urban adventurer, this is a great tool."
3,Screwdrivers suck,The screwdrivers on this thing are much too tight to take out with just your fingernails. I had to file it down to make it loose enough to use. All the other tools come out fine. The knife is nice and SHARP.
2,Not as good as I hoped:(,"I got this knife based on the great reviews it had received. I'm not sure if OXO changed the knife, but it is not as great as people claim! The knife is ridiculously dull! It ruins the lettuce as it poorly attempts to cut it. I actually think it makes my lettuce browner than before just because it doesn't make a clean cut. I would honestly recommend trying a different one, I'm not sure which one, just not this."
2,Don't like it!,"I don't like the fact that it doesn't have a ""regular"" flap opening. Because of it's cylindrical type shape, the ""mouth"" of the bag makes it hard to arrange and load things on the bag. Getting things out is difficult also. If you put something toward the bottom, it's almost impossible to take it our unless you empty the whole content of it out. I would also like to see more external pockets on the bag which is lacking. Unless you plan on carrying a small load of dirty laundry or just throw things in you don't care much about, I would not recomend this bag.The quality on the other hand seem to be good. The stitchings etc are all well constructed."
1,"Sex, but not sexy, nor romantic, nor even interesting","I almost always love an Emma Holly Book. This, however, was awful. The leading lady (well she certainly wasn't a lady) was totally unlikeable, unloveable and uninteresting. How could I possibly care if she ended up with the leading man, when I couldn't care less if she ever came again.Please don't waste your money on this book. Buy ""Strange Attractions"" or ""Menage"" and meet characters that are fascinating and sexy."
4,"Very hot, very impressive writing","As a fellow author (of contempory and historical romance) I am extremely impressed with Emma Holly's use of language and imagery in this book. Besides holding something exciting and inventive at each turn, this is just plain good, lyrical writing, which greatly added to my enjoyment of the story. This was my first foray into erotica, and although I will admit I was a little surprised by it, I was quickly drawn in. I will definitely read more Emma Holly."
3,"Great singer, but songs marred by overproduction","What more can I say? Wayne Wonder is a great singer. The pop-reggae genre is under represented in music today. His choice of songs is really engaging. However (and it's a big however), the CD is overproduced. Listening to it is frustrating because the producer throws in so many little (and often distractingly large) ""improvements"" that the listener sometimes has to consciously decide NOT to listen to all the sounds that are happening in the background -and foreground- of the music. Buy this CD, but be aware that WW would have been better off with a bit more musically chaste producer, like Dr. Dre (of all people)."
3,Wayne Wonder Should be called One Hit Wonder,"Overall his whole cd is nice, if you are into a slower style reggae, but if you are not and you think that this cd is going to be like No Letting Go, the song that aired on the radio. Don't even waste your time buying this cd. Get Reggae Gold 2003, which has a compilation of all of the currently released hits including No Letting Go!"
2,"Not Strong enough in terms of Dancehall,more slow jams","This cd is very weak,the only strong dance songs are Bounce Along,And NO LETTING GO, the rest are typical boring slow grooves for making love too or falling asleep"
5,Don't hold back on Wayne Wonder,"This is one good album. I only bought it because of ""No Holding Back"". I was visiting my home, New York, when I first heard it. I was like dayum I got to get dat, but it wasn't out yet. When I got back to where I currently live (uuugggghhh) I bought it and I love it, I still play it.His cut ""Friend Like Me"" it hot!!!!! The rest of the cuts are banging, what I love about the whole album is all the basslines, you can feel it in your chest, now dats music.Later!!!"
5,THE BEST LOVERS ROCK OUT RIGHT NOW,"FRIST I MUST SAY I'M VERY PROUD OF WAYNE WONDER, I'M A BIG FAN FOR YEARS AND FINALLY HE GETS THE RESPECT HE DESERVE FOR WRITTING HIS OWN SONG WITH SUCH WONDERFUL WORDS FROM SADDEST DAY, JOY RIDE TO NO LETTING GO I DONT SEE ANYONE WHO DESERVE IT MORE. HIS ABLUM IS FULL OF QUALITY SONG THAT WILL LIVE ON BECAUSE THEY ARE ALL ABOUT LIFE, LOVE AND THING THAT HAPPEN IN RELATIONSHIP EVERYDAY WAYNE IS DEFINTELY A LOVER BOY, HE IS AMIRABLE AND HAS A VERY GOOD PERSONALITY AND LOVE ALL HIS FANS AND ALWAY GIVING A 100% ON HIS SHOW, WHEN EVER HE IS IN LOS ANGELES I ALWAYS GO OUT TO SUPPORT HIM OR ANYWHERE NEAR BY I JUST SAW HIM IN LONG BEACH ON AUG 31 HE LEAVE THE PEOPLE WANTED MORE I'M NOT SURE BUT I THINK THEY WERE RUNNING OUT OF TIME SO HE DID'NT PERFORM FOR LONG BUT HE WAS GREAT I LOVE HIM. HIS CD NO HOLDING BACK IS DEFINTELY A MUST BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT IN YOUR COLLETION. GOD BLESS`` PEACENICOLE"
5,So Hott,"This CD's so hott. I haven't read one bad review yet and dat's cuz da album is crazy. You can listen to every track and like it. The best songs are ""Just Another Day"", ""Mood is Right"", and ""Freind Like Me"". This is one of those CD's you jus gotta have. Cop it."
5,Smooth,"This album is amazing...Its been in my car cdplayer for a week straight....I just love to drive and listen! Take my advice, get the disc!"
5,This CD is too good for words,"""No Letting Go"" was an excellent song but unfortunately the radio overplayed it (like it does every other song). I decided to check out some of his other songs and I have one word for them--AWESOME! His CD is out of this world. I love his smooth R&B voice mixed with the reggae beats. Everyone should have a chance to listen to it and I gurantee them that they will not be disappointed! I love his song ""Nobody But Me""! I just hope his next CD can be as good as this! Although I like Sean Paul as well, I think Wayne Wonder does a better job of representing the reggae influx in the US!"
4,Smooth,"I say smooth because WAYNE WONDER is not over the top or too raunchy. The whole cd is REALLY good. This is one of those cd's you throw on when you have a date over the house. Every track stands out, so I won't pick out any because I like them all. 'No Holding Back' is a great title because he does just that."
5,Wonderful product,"I've had a pair of these for several years...one for black pepper and one for white pepper. Every time anyone uses them, they want them."
3,Cooks Plus and Amazon provide great service,"Although I think this pepper mill is a bit disappointing in the way it dispenses the pepper- too slow and too hard to regulate- the service I received from Ryan at Cooks Plus was first rate. He was professional , curteous and very helpful. That made my whole experience worthwhile.Gale"
2,Did not work for me,"It certainly is sleek and looks great. But, my mill only dribbles out a few specs of pepper a little at a time. I had purchased this for cooking to quickly add fresh ground pepper to roasts. This electric mill is many times slower than using a manual grinder. To give you an idea, to add a dash of fresh ground pepper to my eggs takes about 20-25 seconds. I gave up on using it for cooking. I came back here to see how much I spent on it! good grief, what I was I thinking? Do yourself a favor and find something cheaper for this level of performance else you will be disappointed."
5,Hillary Fields Forever!,"A wild romp! It's so good to see such a strong showing from a first time author. Her dialogue and descriptions are breathtaking, pulling the reader into her world and making it a place we'd like to stay."
3,too old,They are too old if u listen to them on greatist hits and then now it doesnt sound anything like them
3,Cover Your Gray Color Comb,"Unfortunately, the shade was not ""dark brown"" as noted on the product. It was too light for my hair, when applied to the roots it left streaks. Which was not too bad, it gave the appearance of highlights; however, the hair also looked matted (probably needed a finer tooth comb).The ease of usage is a plus, I simply combed it through my hair from the roots. Each stroke evenly distributed the color ( would have been nice if it was the right color!). Anyway, I followed the instructions to the letter but, I touched it before the hair dried COMPLETELY! Yuck, felt greasy. After it dried, I brushed and set. The roots looked pretty good, blending in with a highlighted look and, it lasted about a week. Note. I wore a silk cap at night to eliminate spots on the linen. If I had to choose between a dye touch up and the color comb, it would be a matter of which was available. The time and energy expended is basically the same."
1,Does not work on gray roots,"I tried this on my 1"" solid gray/silver roots and it didn't work at all. This product is basically a chunk of dark brown color pushed deep onto the tines of a regular plastic comb. To use it, I had to try to push the comb down deep enough into my roots hoping to transfer some color, but all it did was dampen my roots from the water; no color came off the comb. This might work if the gray you want to cover is somewhere further down your hair but this is just a bad design for covering roots altogether. I recommend the similarly priced ""lipstick tubes"" of color over this inferior product if you have roots to cover."
5,Unboxed color combs,"The product is fine. It's just that I'm used to getting the boxes the product comes in along with the combs. This time, the combs didn't have the boxes. I wondered what happened."
2,misguided,"Thoroughly researched, with a few interesting finds, but the author is hopelessly trapped in the current academic orthodoxies, which lead him into a dull, turgid, unhelpful analysis of Burton's life. He is at pains to state the obvious i.e. Burton was a product of his age and culture, and not from the future, outer space, or hatched from an egg. And yet when Burton displays Victorian characteristics, the author tuts and disapproves. Was Burton racist? Yes he was, except when he wasn't. Was he sexist? Yes, but not really. Surely there are more interesting and fruitful lines of inquiry into such a rich and varied life as Burton's."
2,disappointing,I was hoping for something that had more authentic history to read as I traveled through Montana. I prefer Larry McMurtry.
4,Ipod settings and video quality,"This product works well and allows for you to view pictures and videos on your TV. The resolution was very good on an average sized tv, for larger TVs the video quality suffers a bit but it is still worth purchasing the cables.When I first recieved the cables I was unable to get them to work and was very frustrated. The key is to make sure you'r Ipod settings are configured right. Go into the Video and Audio displays, go to Video Settings and Photo settings and make sure you turn the ""TV Out"" option to on. Once that is done the video/ photo will display on the screen. If this is not done all you will hear is the audio playing through the Tv."
1,Shipping Charges are outrageous!,Please review your order before you buy products from this company. The napkin rings I purchased seemed cheap but the shipping charges were outrageous. Shipping was about 4x the price of the product. I haven't received the products yet so I can't rate the quality of the items.
2,Nice picture but it messed up our TV when it was in the same room.,"The picture was nice and the functions worked very well.The viewing angle was messed up on the first one. The picture could be easily viewed from the top but not from the bottom. It also put horrible lines on our satalite and cable TV even though the digital picture frame was 10 feet from the TV. Bad EMI and it was still there when I used an EMI supressor on the power line.I returned it and when it was sent back to me, the viewing angle was still messed up but the TV interference was better. The store had attempted to fix the unit and failed.I returned it and gave up."
1,Poor picture and brightness,This is one of the more expensive frames but the picture quality and brightness is one of the worst I have seen. The first one I received was broke. The second one just has a dull picture. Very disapointed.
1,TOO ARCADE STYLE,THIS GAME IS NOTHING LIKE REAL TENNIS.THE PLAY STOPS AND FREEZES WHILE A PLAYER HITS A POWER SHOT.I LOVE TENNIS SO I WANT A GAME THAT IS LIKE REAL TENNIS.AND SO FAR ONLY SMASHCOURT TENNIS 2 IS LIKE REAL TENNIS.THIS GAME IS JUST ABOUT FLASH AND LOOKS AND NOT TRUE TO REAL TENNIS.THE STOPPING AND FREEZING AND THEN STARTING UP DURING PLAY IS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ANY TRUE TENNIS FAN TO TAKE.ALSO THE PLAYER IS SO FAR AWAY FROM A BALL AND CAN MAGICALLY GET TO IT WHILE POWERING UP YET AGAIN AND THE SCREEN STOPS PLAY YET AGAIN.AND THEN WHEN IT STARTS IP THE PLAYER IS ABLE TO GET TO THE BALL THAT IS SO FAR AWAY.AGAIN NOTHINGLIKE REAL TENNIS.
5,hmm...,I cant decide what I should get! Mario power tennis or Mario party 6? There both such great games!..-_-...sucha dilemma
2,Brought to you by Nintendo Scam productions...,"There's not much to say about this title. Nintendo was hoping to make some money on any junk with the Mario name. The game is fun at first, but after a couple hours it gets repetitive and totally boring. NOTHING can save this title. Nintendo is trying to trick you with this junk. This whole Mario sports thing is dumb. Golf was the only good one. Guess what's coming next (really, I checked Nintendo's site). Mario soccer, Mario baseball, and (seriously!) Mario Dance Dance Revolution. Uggghhhh! There is only so much money Nintendo can make off Mario. Maybe if we boycott this game and the other Mario sports ones Nintendo will think about quality before cash. (Side note: Though NBA street V3 features 3 Mario characters it is by no means a Mario sports game. In fact, it is rather cool."
4,Great game!,"This is a fun game to play when you want to play tennis when you don't have the chance! If you love tennis and Mario games, then this game will be a good thing to have! You can play as different characters, such as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Yoshi, Koopa Troopa, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Boo, Shy Guy, Bowser, and Bowser Jr. However, this game gets four stars instead of five because sometimes you will find this game a little hard. The special mini-games are sometimes aggravating. You have to beat the time limit and everything, but, it's still a great game. Get it if you think it is fun!"
4,really,"It's great. The game is soooooo fun. But the ghosts get annoying and the background are weird. Every time I try to hit the ball with Yoshi, the stupid thing turns into an eggs. But it's fun. I recommend it."
4,i like the game it's a lot of fun but it gets boring quick sometimes,fun but some of the special games are boring like tic tac glow and the chain chomp game. there is just too much going on on those games it just annoying
3,Okay game,"This game is okay. The graphics are good and there is a variety of mini games. The replay value is moderate. If you want a great Mariosports game, then get Super Mario Strikers when it comes out. It's a Mario soccer game. I played the demo and it was really fun. Get that instead of this."
4,Pretty fun and interesting game.,"When I order it, I purchased it half and half with my nephew.. and I though that it will be a very bad purchase, however I do no repent.. when playing with several people you get pretty excited, that's the benefit of multiplayer games, that you can have fun with friends.. the graphics are good, and it's a fun game."
2,News Flash -Tennis Bores Mario!,"This is Sfmf speaking, and a sudden uproar of disses go to Mario power tennis! (A local residant from Volcano Islands says that: A waste of money! All you do is run back and forth and hit the ball!) I'll be back later with more info.rating : C-"
5,Mario Power Tennis,"This game is a whole lot of fun. There is a great selection of characters from the Mario world, each with their own abilities. The one downside I found was some rallies that go on forever, then again, I suppose that happens in real tennis. This is a good older game to play with friends."
4,"Excellent CD, Vida que Va is better","If you are not a loyal fan ok Kabah YET, start of with Vida que VA, personally I think that that cd is their best one.However Vuelta al mundo stands on its own for being original and displays a more mature approach to pop for this Latin group's sensational music and rhythm."
3,Quivers,Reasonably interesting if your a fan of Sterns show but if your not a Stern fan or aren't familiar with that cast of characters there's no real reason to read it unless your into books where people obsess on traumas in their life which she goes into plenty.
5,Getting Real About Tibet,"This is a great book if you want to learn more about the reality of Tibet, rather than the numerous romantic myths that have been spawned about it in the West. Having lived from my teens to mid-Twenties in a Canadian community where Tibetans were resettled, I can tell you first hand that they are no more good or bad in general than any other people group. Reading a book like this will save you a lot of wasted time in building up fantasies and having them disappointed. It will help you deal with the more obvious problems, like Lobsang Rampa's fictions, as well as gain a more balanced view of the often over-stated claims about Tibetan Buddhism, environmentalism, peacefulness, and all the other projected idealisms that go into changing the actual particulars of real Tibetan society and history into the Shangri-La of Western desire."
3,dissapointing floor funk,When I first put in the cd I was expecting the usually fast paced adrenaline start and then gradually slowing down but this cd wasnt that. It just didnt have the usual Vission sound to it. His first 2 cd's (shut the f*ck up and dance & damn that dj made my day) were both great cd's but this cd was just alright. I guess its a good thing that dj's can change their sound but I didnt like his new sound too much
1,beware!,"I double checked application chart several times,I checked the numbers when it arrived. All correct, I ordered the correct item and Amazon shipped that model.However, after several hours removing the existing air filter components I started building the new system. IT DOES NOT FIT THE THROTTLE BODY! Key cutouts are not there. Volant customer service is not open on Friday. So back it goes. Very disappointed. Will never buy a Volant product again."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"This book is totally marvelous. I couldn't put it down. The author had such insight, and explained everything with such wisdom and knowledge. It amazing that this was written back in 1926, but its interpertations are timeless and powerful.A must read!"
5,authenticity,"most people have a fluffy,half baked idea of what faith actually is...like a pollyanna attitude ..Mrs.Nuzum had to learn to depend on God for EVERYTHING she needed in her life.She did learn that and because of it was able to believe God for powerful miracles when she needed one for herself or someone she was ministering to. Evey believer needs this kind of faith.I would recommend this book to ANY sincere Christian."
2,Just average,"I have 1000 books on faith and religion, Healing is my study and I have seen healing and felt the FIRE of ANGELS, Hebrews 1.14 speaks on the assignments of angels and WHo they are assigned to."
4,An excellent introduction to the Christian life.,"This is a classic on how to live by faith in Christ. The author grounds her material in Scripture and simply and clearly tells the reader how to apply the principles of faith. You don't need a theology degree to understand this book. It is sensible, practical, and very inspirational. It would be a great resource for pastors, Sunday School teachers, and evangelists."
5,Indispensable!,Every Christian who claims to be a true one should read that little book. A indispensable add-on to your Bible. And rest assured that your faith will grow after reading this jewel.
3,Semper Fi,"This was an ok movie, but it wasn't great. I got the impression that the main character in this movie was based on US Marine Sgt John Basilone, who won the USCMH at Guadacanel. It was obvious in some scenes, that it was the late 1960's due to the decor, hairstyles etc."
2,Disappointed !,"I was hoping this movie would have more grit and substance but was very unhappy to see that it was a weak production with many flaws and long tedious sequences that had absolutely nothing to do with combat...A definate ""thumbs down"" affair..."
3,Another fruity floral,Byblos is just okay. It's another fruity floral in the long line-up of fruity floral perfumes. I don't really think there's anything terribly special about this scent.
3,"Only Lead Singer age 19, I ever Saw That Wore Seeing Glasses","Who were these guys agent? Why would they let the lead singer be shown at the age of 19-20 with vision glasses on? I mean WTF?????? Video's cool, songs cool, but I mean cut back the CGI and get some chicks grinding on the band. And get that guy some contacts, WTF???? Well thats why they be gone now, probably graduated from Harvard or Yale now and corporate types."
5,Sharkman Six--great realistic novel,"I'm unsure of the reasoning behind the claim to a lack of reality by other reviewers. I served as a Marine in Somalia, and this represents my experience much more than does Blackhawk Down (which I also enjoyed!) Owen West has hit the nail on the head, and supplies us with entertainment as well as a look at the qualities that the Corps holds most dear."
2,Sharkman Six,"I started reading this book and didn't finish it, as I found it to be a bit lethargic. I'm quite sure that other's would enjoy this story.It is well written if a bit boring. Maybe the story picks up later on, but I didn't read enough to find out."
4,masterpiece....history at its best,"This magnum opus is a veritable treasurehouse of integral history.The authors have chosen the widest possible canvass.They have sustained the pace and momentum throughout the whole series.Their conception is on grand scale,their execution magnificent.Their holistic vision is splendidly reflected in their work.They have succeeded,in a great measure, in making it interesting.Full of vitality,interspersed by occasional flashes of humor,written in vigorous and elegant prose,this story is a sure prescription for elevation of mind."
5,A Must Have For Every History Student-which means everybody,This series is the most complete series on History the world has ever seen and will ever see. It is so utterly complete that the only way anything couuld be added would be by adding books an recent history to the end
1,Boring,The style is tiring and dull.Too much written by one scholar.Better to write less but write interestingly.
2,Vastly overpriced,"I bought this for Kindle at $9.50 - it should have been 99c.One expects an e-book at this sort of price to be fairly good - this certainly is not.It did at least hold my attention to the end, but it is poorly written and badly formatted - line breaks after one or two words, throughout the book, make it disconcerting to read.It's a much sillier story than it appears from Harriet Klausner's gushing review. And, by the way, after several duds that she has lauded, I no longer trust Ms. Klausner!If you want something that will undemandingly pass an hour or two while sitting in public transport, at all means buy it - IF the price is reduced - and delete it straight afterwards as it is certainly not a keeper."
4,Windows NT Server in the Enterprise,"Excellent book, easy to read with all pictures. The details cover all topics that needed for the test."
1,The Grandmothers,"I almost finished the book simply because it was the Book Club pick for the month. But I stopped just short of finishing it. I felt I'd had enough punishment! It was by no means of the imagination a page turner. While the author's depiction of the era was interesting, the actual stories where depressing. I couldn't help but feel that the author was expressing his dislike and disaproval of his relatives."
3,Good,"Unfortunately this opera was recorded I only can think by amateurs, because you can hear very loud the audience, and in the audience there were a lot of people with a flu, clearing their throats, coffing, Eventhou there is an amazing version of ""Je crois entendre"", very slow so Alfredo Kraus holds the notes a little bit longer that in other versions and is very beautiful."
2,Not as representative as it should be,"I got this CD because I wanted to familiarize myself with Marillion; before buying it I hadn't heard much of their material. I probably should have chosen another CD because this one has some weak tracks on it. The liner notes focus on the chart positions achieved by the songs, and that gave me a bad impression of the CD because how well a song does on the charts is not an indication of how good the song is. The only songs I really like on this collection are ""Grendel"" (a 17 minute masterpiece that is reminiscent of classic progressive rock) and ""Torch Song"". I recommend starting with another CD, probably Jester's Tear."
2,Barely Good,"Bought on a whim, hoping it would be entertaining. Very slow to set up, run, progress. Will probably pawn off on my nephews because of the scantily clad girls."
5,Epic Tale Deserving of an Audience,"How rare it is for an author in this day to write an epic poem, a time-traveling odyssey of adventure, betrayal and redemption, pirates and kings. The Voyage of the Arctic Tern is such an adventure and more, handsomely decorated with pen illustrations on every page. Best read aloud, I read it to my class of fifth graders, who at first struggled, listening to a novel written in rhyme, then became engrossed in it. But adults would revel in it as well. Hugh Montgomery's story is richly imagined, and his poetry beautiful and strong. This book deserves to be widely read and savored."
1,a must read-aloud,"I didn't know if I'd like this book when I took it out of the library because of the style it was written in but as I read the story took on the rhythm of the poem as if you were actually on the ship on the water. I re-read it about a year later and liked it even more the second time around. It would be a great story to read to anyone who enjoys a good pirate, sailing adventure."
3,Not as comfortable as Speedo gloves,"These run a bit smaller than the speedo versions - the Speedo large was a bit too big for me and the medium here is a bit tight. Although smaller, it doesn't leave as much finger tip exposed and I'm not fond of the enclosed thumb. However, they are not uncomfortable (once I'm swimming I don't find them tight, just when putting them on). The velcro closure seems to hold better than the Speedo one's did."
3,Be careful of sizing!,Very small and tight! I thought they would loosen up but they were veryconstricting. Seems well made and I have other products by Aqua Sphere that I like. My hands are pretty small and I don't usually have a problem but I ended up giving them to a child.
4,Aqua gloves,Great for resistance swimming in place of pool weights.Run a bit smallArrived on time.Would definately recommend.Pretty good value.
2,size matters!,"online this product seemed to be exactly what i was looking for; however, they are TOO BIG. i have already used them, so don't feel comfortable returning. but they are so large, they are virtually useless in the water. in fact, my left hand was aching after using, because of the pressure on it to move so much material through the water. i will order a size small next time around. the size i have now is medium, and they seem almost like they were made for a man. the second pair that i ordered, the neoprene, with a zipper, are perfect, also size medium.Aqua Sphere Webbed Swim Gloves"
1,Unbelievable,"I got this book at a used book sale and it was rather startling. It would be hilarious if it wasn't for the fact that books such as these express beliefs accepted by the scientific and literary mainstream at the time they were written. In other words, the book contains countless musings on the ""Yellow Peril"" facing ""White"" civilization, the supposedly sneaky, deceptive, crafty nature of all ""Orientals"", and so on.The main characters of the book are white male British imperialists at war with an ""insidious Oriental"". Yet they cannot help being attracted to an Asian woman, who is apparently not herself ""racially"" capable of returning the ""hero's"" love in a genuine fashion. It was cartoonish and I actually think this book could be useful for scholarly research as evidence of how bad it really was...and unfortunately is, as the positive reviews by those not ""infected"" with ""political correctness"" attest."
4,Super Reader,"The breathless but brave and unrelenting goofball Nayland Smith and his stoic offsider and chronicler Petrie pursue the genius superman, the ultimate embodiment of the Yellow Peril, Dr Fu-Manchu.Helped along the way by his beautiful but unwilling servant Kramanèh is a game of capture and escape and disguise around London.You have to give the good doctor credit for trying to kill 'em with poison gas stashed in a mummy's tomb.The guy can't be all bad. He has a monkey.Very entertaining."
1,:(,"The book was sent to my address in China, but still hasn't arrived. It's now past one month since it was ordered."
4,Spectacular Orientalist Cheese...,"Every orientalist cliche you could imagine, knee-deep like the pile of some hallucinatory Oriental rug. I'm sure there are those who'd find it insulting... but to me it was just kitschy fun. Frankly, I would NOT want a kid to read this-- they don't know enough to sift through the stereotypes. But it deserves to be picked up for any undergraduate cultural studies syllabus dealing with Western ideas about the Orient. (It also helps that it's a fun read, in its own pulpy way. Great airplane book.)"
5,Great Riding Toy,"My wife and I bought this for our Son back before the Christmas Holidays 2011. This toy was to be our Son's gift from Santa and Santa did not disappoint. Our Son was 11 months at the time, already walking and running around on his own so we thought this would be the perfect gift for him. It was and he fell in love with it immediately after opening up his gift. His face lit up!!! This has been a great toy and I highly recommend this riding toy.This toy was a lot more detailed than I expected. The Elmo figure in front moves with the music, the buttons all do something, the propeller lights ups, their is a storage bin, the back has a plastic piece that keeps it from tipping over backwards. Its light weight and has been durable.No complaints. I highly recommend this toy."
2,Great until motor stops working after 3 mths...,"Our daughter is an Elmo freak, so she was in love w/ this toy for the 3 months she had it until the motor to the propeller stopped working. My husband took it apart, there is a small motor which powers the eyes, elmos's arms, as well as the propellar through a gear system but without this one tiny motor spinning none of these other parts it powers works. It just makes noises and our daughter says ""Off??"" in a pitiful little voice. I'm disappointed that tek nek does not sell these parts separate (of course they make more money when you have to buy the entire product over) and expected more than 3 mths of enjoyment out of this."
5,Great Product! Glad I purchased it!,"I bought this item for Christmas for my nephew because I had not seen anything like it in stores. It was better than I thought! The front end of the toy really does whirl around and Elmo dances at the same time! The price was great also. Needless to say, this was by far my nephew's favorite Christmas toy. He wouldnt get off of it!!!!!!!!"
2,"Great Idea, Poor Quality/Design","I got this for my son's 2nd birthday. He loves all things Elmo, and airplanes, so it was the perfect toy that combined both his loves. The toy itself is okay, but within the first day after opening his gift, the propeller stopped working. in fact, any moving parts stopped working altogether. Now he just rides around in it, and pushes buttons for sounds. The wings fold up, though, so it is more compact for storing. Also, he likes the underseat storage.The reason I am giving it less than 3 stars is the fact that, as other reviewers have pointed out, it tips fairly easy. However, he is a bit older/bigger than the ideal for this toy, so he is able to prevent most of the falls. Though, he has fallen once or twice.A bit overpriced for a ride-on that doesn't work properly, but he still likes it because it is Elmo, and it is an airplane. I am just disappointed in the poor construction and the even poorer design."
2,Not a fan . . .,"I will admit that my son (15 months) seems to really like this toy, and the turning propeller is neat, but over all this toy is a POS. Batteries wear down too fast, and with all the bells and whistles I think it is somewhat over stimulating. A few times various components have quit working (like the propeller and the moving elmo on the front) and started working again later, which makes me think that there is a wiring issue with this toy. Between the simpler Little Tikes walker/ride on and this, my son seems to prefer little tikes more even though it doesn't have all the blinky lights etc. Unfortunately he received this heap as a gift so I'm just hoping it gets recalled soon so I can get rid of it."
5,Perfect for a 2 Year Old,"I gave this to my niece for her second birthday and she is obsessed. As a lover of Elmo I knew she would like it that part but I was hesitant about the size and the propeller. Turns out the size is perfect and she loves to ride around the house and push her stuffed animals around on it. I wasn't sure what the propeller was made of and if it could potentially hurt her fingers if she touched it while spinning. It does not spin that fast and it is softer so, no problems there. I definitely recommend this for the Sesame Street loving toddler in your life."
5,Grat Ride On toy for any small child!,"This Elmo Airplane is very interactive and also well balanced. It has a ""wheelie"" bar on the back so the kids cannot tip over on it. There are buttons to push everywhere which activates the propellar and sounds. The propellar is made of an extremely soft foam that cannot possibly hurt if any child were to touch it while spinning. This is a great toy and also great service! I got my shipment quite fast and in GREAT shape."
5,GREAT TOY!,"My cousin got this as a present for her first birthday, then it was given to my son at 8 months. he loved it he grabs the propeller as it is spinning all the time, and it hasn't broke yet and that's been 4 months plus the wear and tear from my little cousin. it is fantastic toy he is just now learning how to make the buttons make the propeller move and started scooting around with it around 9 months. i would highly recommend this for any child around 1 yr old. however, our cousin is 3 now and she still wants to play with it when she is over visiting."
4,Kids riding toy,Lots of lashing lights and sounds. It even calls out to play when left to sit. 2 and 3 year old kids will love it.
5,the hit of the party!,"I bought this for my 22 month old great nephew for Christmas. I didn't realize it was Amazon's Frustration Free packaged until I started wrapping it. Wow. What a great concept. It was all ready to play with the minute the box was opened. My nephew got on it and stayed on it the remainder of the night. He could've cared less about all of the other presents he had. It is very interactive and has lots of little buttons, etc. The storage under the seat is just right fo a handful of Cheerios. I highly recommend this as a gift for a little one."
1,Horribly designed - dangerous,"My 18 month year-old just fell forward and hit his head because, as another reviewer pointed out, the toy has nothing to prevent it from tipping forward and the front wheels are located too far back toward the middle and the center of gravity. I highly recommend finding another, better thought-out riding toy for your child. What's more, this toy malfunctioned the second day we had it, making loud clicking noises when the propeller rotates (apparently related to the mechanism that makes Elmo move back and forth, which also does not work properly)."
5,Very Cute!,This toy was a big hit with all my grandchildren on Christmas morning! They were all wanting to ride on it! It is very cute!
1,Tip-over hazard,"This toy is not balanced properly. It tends to tip forward far too easily, and baby could fall face-first into the floor. Really wanted to like it, but it's just not safe."
3,"interesting, but some design concerns","my one-year-old grandson had difficulty making this toy move because of the deign, despite the fact that he was already walking. he loved the sounds and the fact it was an Elmo toy. it should be noted my grandson is also large for his age."
5,best gift!,My daughter loves this airplain. She is not even walking yet but she can ride the airplaine all through the house. She loves to fold the wings in and out. Very cute and fun toy.
5,My daughters first birthday,I love this airplane. My one year old has so much fun with this. My daughter loves the sound and light show. It's very easy for her to get on and ride.
4,Pleasantly surprised,"My boys love this toy. Not just any ""ride-on"" toy. Many buttons to push, knobs to turn, etc...I didn't expect them to be entertained for long but it does keep them busy for a while."
2,Cute but poorly made,"My son loves Elmo and airplanes. I didn't realize the propellers spin or the eyes moved until recently. It never did it before. Then it was moving all around and my son loved it. About two weeks later, it stopped. It was very disappointing. He has never been able to ride this. He has been too tall for this product since he was 1. Now he just likes us to fly it in the air, to press the buttons, and to hide stuff in the seat."
2,Looks cheap in reality,"I do not recommend it to anyone; just the Dolce-Gabbana stamp is not enough to buy something. Maybe my expectations were very high, I won't know! But the print on the tie looks cheap, while the material feels to be even cheaper."
2,An Essay Puffed Up,"The book is made up of about 10 pages of the history of the screw/screwdriver, 15 pages of the author's frustrating research (his frustration, not the reader's), and 120 pages of filler. Much of the filler is interesting but Rybczynski struggled hard, and wandered far, to find enough words to fill this very slim book (probably only 20,000 words). Since less than 10% is about the subject, the substance isn't quite enough for a solid magazine article. I wanted, and expected, more. I'm sure Rybczynski's editor did, too. Given the author's academic profession, I would think the book was the product of the ""Publish or perish"" syndrome were it not for his considerable resume of published books. I suspect that Professor Rybczynski, were he to read this review, might acknowledge that he was caught."
3,An Interesting Magazine Article,"This little book illustrates one way to turn a magazine article into a book: write about the writing as much as about the subject. And so the author tells us how he came to the idea of an article about screws and screwdrivers; he tells us about the libraries he went to to research it, the books he read, and their authors lives; he describes the museums he visited and the displays he saw there; and he describes the stream of consciousness that led him along the way. The result is a non-chronological treatment that can be a bit confusing; and although structured as a detective story, using hints from obscure books and museums to trace a path steadily farther back into history, the materials in the last chapter -- on the use of screw devices in the ancient world -- are actually the most commonly known and available. But the story is pleasantly told and along the way we do learn what there apparently is to know about the history of the screw and screwdriver."
2,Not enough content for a full book,"It's a book about the history of the screwdriver. Really it's an extra long feature article in book form. The author, a guy with a truly unpronounceable name, takes us on an exploratory journey to unearth the most important tool invented in the last thousand years. As he makes his case for the screw and screwdriver, he introduces a lot of great tool history and trivia. My favorite part was his discussion of the button hole, one of those very-useful but not-so-intuitive inventions."
1,a history of the research of the history of the screwdriver,i kept waiting for him to stop writing about his research and start writing the history of the screwdriver.
3,More a research log for tool afficionados,"The book was not what I expected. Turns out that it's mostly about the author's exploration to find out where the screw came from. But that's only about 30% of the book. The rest is investigations into other tools, and the author's discussion of his investigation.I'd definitely recommend this book for someone who was interested in tools, especially old tools, and for someone who is interested in the history of tools.It is not, however, a technical book on screws, or even tools for that matter. Light easy reading."
4,Who Could Guess There Is So Much Behind The Common Screw?,"The screw and screwdrivers are items we regard as everyday, ho-hum items, if we even consider them at all. Yet, without the screw and screwdriver we would certainly have a very different world. The screw is responsible for holding our doors up, keeping our planes flying, making computers work and a host of other jobs too numerous to mention. Of course, the screw would be of little use to us without the ordinary screw driver.This book is a fascinating look back at the history of the screw, which traces itself back to Archimedes' time and the screw driver, which allowed the screw to be used for so much more than the relatively simple jobs once delegated to it. I found it amazing that the screwdriver wasn't invented until hundreds of years following the screw. The book is well written, with an eye for detail and will fascinate anyone with a curiosity about the history of ""things""."
4,Blah with patches of delight,"Overall it reads sleepily. However I did enjoy the second half of the book more, it just takes a long time for the author to cut to the chase.I really enjoyed reading about the development of lathes and the different types of drives. Especially the Robinson drive. I even did a speech on the Robinson drive, using mainly knowledge from this book.So, it has things to offer for the ""mechanical bent""(as he calls it in the book), the author just takes his sweet time to introduce them."
2,Interesting stuff but extremely poorly organized,"As a person interested in history, a person interested in technology and most importantly a person interested in tools, I really thought this book would be right up my alley. The history of the screwdriver and the screw is full of really interesting tidbits, plot twists and characters.Rybczynski does a great job of digging into the history of these seminal inventions and figuring out exactly where they came from. However, this is one of the most poorly organized books I have read in the last year. Instead of telling the reader the story as it happened, Rybczynski instead tells the story of his investigation of the history of the screwdriver. He jumps from the 19th century to the 15th and back again, making it really hard to follow. This book took a really fascinating story and killed it through a terrible presentation."
2,An Unnatural History,"Professor Rybczynski's work demonstrates the power of the good vocabulary and writing skills that come with an education. He has managed by providing the reader with the history of the project, the tools in his tool box, the discussions with his wife that led to the identification of the screw driver as the subject of the book, to overcome the lacunae between a pamphlet and a 176 page book. This is unfortunate. The book contains just enough of the chronology and individual lives involved in the development of the screw and the tools required to turn it, to provide a real technical historian a terminus a qou from which to produce a fascinating book. This one however should have remained a pamphlet."
3,complaints...,"Sorry to say, the first three things I used the micra two of them left marks on the tool...cleaning my nails worked great, reallycutting a few thin branches of a buddleja davidii left the scissors rubbing against each otherand the worst experience (and the one because of I sit here and take time to write) when I tried to open a little screw which holds the blade of a pencil sharpener with the small screwdriver on top of the bottle openener - it did not turn the screw, but the screw driver's cone end got seriously distorted - I managed to get him back quite even by rotating in the opposite direction at last...so forgive me but I expected a little more from this Leatherman hand tool - under this condition, a tool for USD 8,- would do the job at least equal, in my opinionmy rating is between 2 and 3 - future will show, today it is not a ""I don't like it"" so I chose the 3 but it is definitely not okby the way, Amazon did a good job delivering (free) as always"
5,Great quality item - impressed!,"Very strong well made item that should last a long time. Tweezers are next to useless - they need a serrated grip. All other attachments are first class. Recommended. It's a little heavy for a keychain but still OK and smaller than what you think. Scissors are nice and heavy-duty - more like a pair of shears. They would benefit from a built-in wire cutter, however. None of my gripes prevent it from getting 5 stars."
2,placement of key ring interferes with use of knife blade; dumb design,"After I had to surrender my Leatherman Squirt at a TSA screening (I forgot to leave it in the car!), I replaced it with the Micra. I carry the knife on my key ring, and there is no way to safely extend the knife blade for use without interference from either the bundle of keys, or the knife's scissor blades. You can either have your keys in the way, mitigated by an awkward grip, or you can grasp the knife with the scissor blades against the palm of your hand. The problem could have been avoided by attaching the key ring to the opposite end of the knife. Since the knife blade is the tool I most commonly use, the Micra just doesn't work for me. I'll wind up tossing it in a junk drawer just as soon as I replace it with a Squirt or maybe a small Swiss Army knife."
4,Neat little tool...,"Got this for my Daughter. Can't give it 5 stars because I wouldn't carry it and it seems a little fragile. Overall it is very good and worth the price, just not 5 stars in my opinion."
5,the perfect size,"I bought one of these and found it to be the3 perfcet size as I can easily carry it all the time on my keychain. As I always have it, it aqlways comes in handy.So much so that I bought one for all the guys working for me."
5,"awesome, very handy tool","I recently lost one of these given to me on my birthday. I ordered another one almost immediately. It comes so handy on so many occasions: camping, opening boxes and letters, cutting, etc. I would always keep it as my key chain. Just remember to put it in your check-in luggage when you fly -- that is how I lost my previous one! Also, the knife is very sharp which is great, just have to be careful cutting stuff with it :)"
4,Handy tool,It contains many helpful tools and it fits into your pocket for unexpected chores. It also makes a great gift.
5,Many Years of Service from my Leatherman Micra,"I have owned a Micra for many years. I recently misplaced it. And after reaching in my pocket a dozen or more times a day for it, I decided to buy another. After shopping around I bought mine from Amazon, best price, best service.Well the old one was found and retired to spare..It will surprise you how quickly this little tool will become so useful you will not want to be without it.Leatherman 64010101K Micra Multi-tool"
4,Good tool,It's well made and has useful tools. It's not quite as good as the squirt S4 model because you must open it to get access to the tools.
4,Best Little Multi-Tool I've Ever Owned,"For years, I used to carry around the ""Swiss Army Classic SD"" pocket knife, and was constantly frustrated by how useless it was-- the scissors were a joke (they were hard to use, and quickly became gummed), the knife was tiny, the tweezers and toothpick were often misplaced. So when it was confiscated by airport security, I went looking for a better alternative. Enter the Micra.First off, Amazon's price is a bit high... I've seen these ranging from $10-15 at local stores. Be that as it may, the Micra is a great tool to keep in your pocket-- small, compact, and highly useful. The scissors are bigger and much easier to use, the screwdriver has saved me a few times (although to be fair, there is very little leverage to be gained from such a tiny driver).My only major knock is that the tools open from the INSIDE of the micra, which can be a hassle. Other than that, it's a great tool to have in your pocket for emergencies."
5,For those who want small multitool w/scissors instead of pliers,"It folds to roughly the size of 2 fingernail clippers side by side, and has scissors where larger multitools have pliers. It is the perfect multitool if you spend more time in an office than working on your engine.Have used in office environment for a couple months now and would highly recommend."
5,best tool ever,"This is my second Micra pocket tool. First one lasted several years, but blades got dull, and almost impossible to sharpen these small things.Must use it at least once per day, and often loan it to my wife or others who need to snip or nibble something. Small enough to disappear in your pocket. Highly recommend it to everyone, including women."
4,Great tool to keep with you at all times.,"The scissors work fantastic considering their size and the knife is the sharpest I've seen in a mini-multitool. nice size, lightweight, sexy look. Ruler and nail file are unnecessary. It may sometimes pinch your fingers when first getting used to it(but what multitool doesn't?). It's a good item to keep with you at all times. Overall its my favorite of my 3 mini multitools."
1,Leatherman Micra multi tool,"Leatherman 64010103K Micra MultitoolPlease DO NOT be deceived by the Leatherman Micra multi tool ""64010103K"" image posted on the Amazon site.I received the Micras without the ""USA"" inscriptions from Amazon.This is not the older versions of Micra that were manufactured in the USA. The USA version was believed have better quality than the newer models that are manufactured overseas.So WHY did I have to pay a premium for them vs the 64010101K version which is sold at Amazon at a lower price?"
1,Too Small and Too cheap,When I opened the package the tool was rusted. The site says 10 features I can only find 8. The handle is constructed of light sheet metal that hurts your hand. Watch out when closing or the spring loaded close will pinch a finger.Look to Gerber for the best tools!
1,This thing is pretty useless.,"I think I lost it, but I seriously don't mind. I'm not sure when useless scissors or a 1.5"" knife would come in handy."
4,Micra Multitool,I ordered two of these tools as stocking stuffers for my sons at Christmas. They were pleased with the tool and used it that morning to help open the packaging of the other gifts they received.They have pocket knives but they both said that they like this little tool better than their other knives.
4,Excellent,"Pros: This knife is perfect for placing on a keychain, for small chores and sundries around the house like opening boxes, etc. The scissors are sharp and ""spring-loaded"" (not a spring, but you get the idea). The stainless housing is perfect for keys and other scratchy surfaces, and will maintain a smooth, even appearance for years to come.Cons: The only real drawback that I found was that the bolt on one end had been tightened too much, making the tweezers stick out on the side. This could easily cause pocket snags, poke holes in your pockets, or more. It took about 10 minutes of needle-nose pliers on both ends to get the bolt tightenend appropriately, and it has been perfect ever since. Not a big problem, and if you'd rather exchange the knife I'm sure Leatherman would do it in a snap--I just didn't want to wait longer.All in all, an excellent purchase, and it has worked like a charm ever since!"
3,to be or not to be ....a leatherman,"I'm happy with my purchase, however I also purchased an exact leatherman on E-bay. Upon closer inspection of the same product I found them to be slightly different in appearance. My first thought was, what gives? Are they both the real deal or are they both fake. No way for me to tell so I cannot say one way or the other."
3,"This is a great book, but small compared to the one I checked out from the library.","Lots of good ideas for doing art with my grandson. I am a watercolor artist and found this really a fun book, but didn't realize this was a small version."
3,The Usborne Book of Art Skills,Book is alittle small. Make sure you look at size. Other than that great book!
3,OK read but no romance,The book was ok for the most part. But about half way u can tell what is going to happend next and the book was lacking romance.(BIG TIME) There was time or two I wanted to jack slap charlie because she was dumb and stupid which is what made the book funny. However the book was lacking something for the most part a fast quick ok read
3,Disappointing quality for a Leatherman,"I like this tool because of the external access to scissors and the knife, plus the smaller size. However, it is rather difficult to close when fully opened, it is hard to get the tools out, and some of the tools don't lock in place very well. The first one I received was defective and the can/bottle opener wouldn't lock at all. I have 3 other Leatherman tools (the kick, fuse, and squirt), all were cheaper and are higher quality. I usually carry the Squirt in my knife pocket and it achieves nearly the same level of functionality as the Juice. This tool just doesn't live up to Leatherman's typical quality and feels like it was made in China."
4,nice medium sized multitool,"This wasn't the cheapest leatherman out there. I was contemplating this one or the wingman, which i believe has more tools and a spring loaded pliers which I like on my leatherman squirt. However i opted for this one because of the size and good reviews on quality. I am definately satisfied with my purchase. It really seems well built, and fits great a jean pocket without being to bulky or heavy. for the size and what I will use it for it is perfect. The scisor is why I went with the s2 model, but i must say the scisor on my victorinox huntsman works a bit better(I used both to cut up an old credit card). That is really my only gripe."
4,Amazingly handy,"This is a very handy, relatively small multi-tool.Pros:Not too bigPliers work well (main tool)Lots of different tools includedNice that is comes in multiple colorsVery sturdyCons:Tools do not ""lock"" open. Not many multi-tools have this but it would be nice if at least the blade had a lock on it.I got sand in mine and it might never be the same. If you squeeze it occasionally you can hear a crunching of the microscopic sand I can not get out of it.This tool is nice, and for the size and expected uses it excels. I would recommend this to a friend."
4,Handy little tool,The pliers/wire cutter and screw drivers are excellent but the blade and can/bottle opener are thin. The opener would probably snap off if you gave it a little torque while opening a can. The scissors are small but once I had them in my pocket they turned out to be more useful than I expected. The screwdrivers were difficult to open at first but a few uses loosened them up nicely.
4,Great pocket multi-tool,"I used to own a full-size Leatherman tool, but found I rarely had it with me when I needed it because it was too bulky so it always sat at home in a drawer. This tool does a nice job of balancing commonly used tools in a small enough design that I can carry it around without it feeling cumbersome. The trade-off for the reduced size is fewer features. But I've found I don't really miss the features that were left off this particular model because I didn't use them very often. This model still has several different screwdriver heads, a knife, pliers, and scissors (which work ""ok"", kind of like elementary school classroom scissors). And for most common tasks, that's plenty. There are some other functions on it but the ones I mentioned are the ones I use the most. The build quality feels solid, just like a typical Leatherman."
2,I would not reccomend this series,Very boring I just watched the first two disc thinking that the story would get a little bit interesting... but no... it just gets boring and dragging. I will not recommend this series.
5,"America, Bleep yeah!","Got this for two reasons. One to show my love of country...nuff said. Two because you can't miss this in the woods :) and if you don't want to get hit again walking back to base, even a moron should be able to see this atop your marker. Oh and also, it's made by smart parts... so again, nuff said! Get it!"
3,The mystery continues and the charm remains.,"I read the previous reviews of this book before I read the book itself and must admit I was expecting a more caustic approach to describing Opal's life than I found. I felt that sometime's the author's opinions were rather flip but I generally did not find them mean-spirited. HOWEVER, I was very disappointed in the lack of footnotes and index. The author is primarily a novelist, but that fact should not condone presenting research without proof of fact. Are we supposed to accept Ms Becks word unsubstantiated, but not Opals?Opal, regardless of her fragile mental state (that seems to have affected different people in different ways), left us with a gift; a way of seeing the natural world with an innocence that was unusual then and vitually unknown today.For that I am willing to put up with her personal weaknesses, however they existed."
1,Ms. Beck - You Must Step Back To See Opal's Soul,"Ms. Beck is putting a microscope on a person that needs to be seen from one step back. You missed her essence. Rather than cast a critical gaze on Opal's writing skills, when it was written, when it was not, or if it indeed happened, Opal's story still stands, regardless of how it was created. I have read anything in print or on websites about her. Ms. Opal is truly magical and very meaningful to those of us who cherish her, regardless of how Ms. Beck formulates her ""case""."
3,"Does the trick, but not as long burning as advertised.","I lit two of these at the same time. The flames only lasted between 40-45 hours and the wax melted and became quite a mess. Other than that, it is a good product for the price."
4,candle,"I have not used this candle as yet.---but since we live in an area known for earthquakes?I thought it would be best to stock up on Emergency supplies.Seems like a really good deal to me, as it will burn for many hours."
5,Great use of vertical space and attractive,"I ordered 3 sets of the configurations shoe rods for my 8' closet system. I placed these side-by-side across the bottom of the uprights (you may need to order extra upright extensions). These were very easy to assemble and install. Versatile too. You can display shoes toes forward or simple flip unit over to display heels forward. I prefer toes forward. Takes up so little vertical space and easily holds 6 pairs of shoes per shoe rod set (3 across and 2 deep). Shoes really do need to have a heel though in order to stay on the rods, otherwise they just slide off. I placed my flats and tennis shoes on the floor under the shoe rods but they are still faily visible due to the simple design of the shoe rods. Highly recommend the entire Rubbermaid Configurations closet systems, and the shoe rods for your shoes with heels."
2,You're better off with an extendable shoe rack you can put on the floor,"I bought two of these for my Deluxe Closet System, but returned them immediately. These take up a lot of vertical space from the system, and the system is designed to be set up at a certain heigth, so you loose space below the lowest rack.The closet we configured allowed us to have a separate, longer shoe rack put on the floor, with two racks. We have 12 shoe pairs below the closet.Alas, since it all depends on the configuration of your closet, you might find them useful. The beauty of the closet system is that you can tailor it to your needs... The drawback is that you only have so much ""rail"" space, and I found it more useful to have a rack or a basket accessory than shoes. By the way, rail extensions can be bought here too, which is great."
4,If your shoes don't have heels.,The shoe rods allow you to put more shoes in the same space vs. the shoe shelves. We stack one shoe on the front and its mate on the back. That allows us to review all shoes without having to struggle to see what's in the back. I gave it four stars because the chrome surface of the rods allow shoes with no heels to slide off. I applied some friction tape (like the type you would use on bicycle handle bars) to the surface of the rods to facilitate a better grip.
4,Handy Shoe Storage Holds 4 Pairs of Men's Size 13,"These shoe rods hold only 4 pairs of my size 13 boots, but appear large enough for 6 pairs of smaller shoes. Sturdy enough for boots, but I wouldn't put them where a kid would try to stand on them. Consider additional upright extensions if you want these close to the floor. I find the space below them useful for other items stored on the floor, so don't mind them being so high. They use space more efficiently than using regular shelves (in the Rubbermaid Configurations system) for shoes, but I have not tried the system's shoe shelves to be able to compare. Easy to assemble with the provided Allen wrench. Install the shoe rods one way for toes in or flip the assembly over (no disassembly or reassembly required) for toes out. Try a set today!"
2,American market,This book was redone for the American market and in doing so most of the real content of the book was lost. Stick to the full version if you want the real nitty grity of the science of these great men. I have it in my collection of 7000 books but will have to buy the full version to really come to grips with some of the Mathematics. On the other hand the illustrations were great and should keep students amused. It came from Amazon and so will the full version once I save the money.
3,"Fine, But Not So Fine","Just got the book today. I don't understand why 3 books all coming from the Amazon warehouse had to be shipped in 2 packages, and why both packages were shipped the same day via the same carrier but arrived 5 days apart! Anyway, I opened the book today and it looks like it's gonna be a tough read, not like the same author's The Illustrated Theory of Everything (I bought the illustrated versions of these books just to avoid making them tough reads, like his non-illustrated A Brief History of Time which I couldn't even finish). But the biggest frustration of all - the book arrived from Amazon with a damaged cover! The damage is not big, but I pride myself in being able to keep my collection of books in pristine condition even after 3 decades. Well, I'm just too lazy to go out of my way and call them up to return the product!"
3,Princess Leia,"It was a typical costume, not very sturdy but good enough for a coupleof usesTypical costume, kinda cheap but good enough for a couple of uses. Roomy enough to layer if the weather is cold."
4,Wonderfully illuminating commentaries on Lolita.,"This casebook looks at Nabokov's controversial novel from different angles based on diverse critical schools. It comments on the narrator,on the Americanisation of Humbert Humbert, on the rhetorical tools used to capture the reader and illuminates the way readers have reacted to this wonderful novel. It also takes into account the films on Lolita and discusses them in relation to the book. All in all it is an important aid in deciphering the rhetorics of Nabokov's fiction and glimpsing what it is that makes him such an important author."
5,Couldn't ask for better,"I had excellent service. Very easy,no problems. I made this purchase through Amazon. I always have great success at Amazon and affilliates."
3,Worth buying,"A worth buying ep including the cannibal corpse cover of metallica's classic no remorse, and they did a great job, i bought the cd for the cover song the rest is ok"
3,A decent metal album...,"I love the drum and guitar tracks on all their albums especialy this short little EP. The only thing I still don't like is the lyrics bathed with gore and violence. It's rediculous. If this bad straightened it out a little, maybe not as bad lyrics. Maybe get it up to Slipknot lyrics, this would be the perfect metal band. I would recommend this album if you looked more into the structure of an album such as the tracks of music. The drums are unbelievable in this album and the guitar riffs will blow you away. I'd get this album if you look for music rather then lyrics. This is truely a great album in addition to all their others and another album worked hard on by them."
3,Good book for beginners,This book contains much information of how to care for your bonsai. Some well known bonsai are use throught the text. It contains good illustratuins covering most important topics and an excellent Appendix with chart of activities and timing of procedures for most species. The Black and white photographs are not to good.
4,Clears up skin.,"I am a male in my late 20's and I use this for adult acne. It really clears the skin up and has a, ""cool and fresh"" feeling to it. I use Noxzema twice a day.Won't over-dry or irritate my sensitive skin.Also excellent for sun burns!"
1,mommy of two,"This book using ingredients not found in a ""normal"" kitchen. I have had it 3 years and used it once."
2,not good enough to recommend,oh my goodness this is sooo boring!!! even my toddlers 20m and 2 1/2yrs find it boring. i dont like baby mozart if you do you might like this dvd. by comparison my babies adore the lots to learn dvd's they are so stimulating and fun to sing along to - they cant watch them enough
5,Pediatrician recommended,"My 20 month old is behind in his vocabulary development and this was recommended my his pediatrician. My little boy Loves this movie. It entertains him, and I believe he is learning while we watch it."
2,"nice, but my baby loves BARNEY more..",It was just OK...I wish they combined music together with it...it would have been fun ....my baby does not enjoy it.
5,It's Worth the Purchase!,My 3 month old sits and watches these dvd's until it finishes. Very colorful and engaging. I would recommend if you want to develop your child's abilities early.
1,Daughter did not like it,My 1 yr 4 month old daughter just did not like this video. She would whine when it played. I think it was too slow for her. She prefers the LeapFrog and Sesame Street videos.I know some feel strongly about how their kids love this video. I'm not doubting that. But my baby just didn't enjoy it.
5,"Better than watching regular television, Learned her colors in couple days","so i got this dvd a day or two ago, and my 2 1/3 yr old little girl already knows her colors. she is a tv/ movie addict (terrible, i know). anyways it was a little boring for her, and for me, but it does work. and hey, she went off and played with her toys which never happens because she is always watching Disney dvds. even if she doesnt watch the whole thing through, in a couple weeks of playing the video for her, i know she'll have her colors down and we can move on to other things. it is the same concept as flash cards and just repeating the words, but my little one is already a diva and doesnt pay any attention to her mommy ;)"
5,Won't Contribute to a Short Attention Span,"With the AAP guidelines on television viewing for children under two, many people worry about allowing a baby or toddler to watch any videos at all. I think it's fairly safe to say that this particular video is not going to increase a child's risk of ADD/ADHD. (I write this as someone who watches no television at all herself and allows her son to watch one age-appropriate, short DVD per day.) There is no fast cutting. There is no fast movement. There is nothing in this video that could remotely be called over-stimulating. This video is probably more sedate than regular playing in the living room. I can't stand to sit through it.And yet, my 16 month old son loves it. He asks for this video by name--""Coh! Coh! [meaning Colors! Colors!]"" He loves to call out the names of the colors when they slowly walk onto the screen.Educational, enjoyable (for my son), and not, I think, a contributor to a short attention span--that's a home run in my book."
2,I really *want* to like this DVD,"I really like the idea of this DVD. Teaches a basic concept - colors, in a format that won't overstimulate.Each color is introduced, one at at time, and the only words spoken are those colors. For example, the fuzzy yellow thing comes on and you hear ""yellow, yellow . . . yellow, yellow, yellow . . . yellow, yellow, yellow, yellow . . . yellow, yellow."" Repeat with blue, black, white, green, etc. It eventually robs you of your will to live.This is a great movie to borrow from the public library, or your friend. Just don't buy it, because you can't watch it more than a handful of times."
5,The best money you can spend!,"I don't even know how to begin to describe how much my 19 month old daughter loves this dvd. She is somewhat speech delayed and within one viewing started saying ""yellow."" (She only says about 4 other words total) She was absolutely mesmerized by it - even more so than she is with the 'entertaining' shows she watches, like Sesame Street, Teletubbies, etc... Just by watching her face, you can tell that it is getting through to her and that is priceless. Thank you Preschool Prep!"
5,Meet the Colors,I am very pleased with Meet the colors. I haven't found any Preschool prep DVD's I don't like.
5,Simply amazing. Simple yet so effective!,"My daughter has only been watching this for 2 weeks off and on and already names all of her colors (at 18 mos.). This is the 4th DVD we've bought from this company, and we are big fans!!"
3,Solid Electronic Music/Jazz Cd,"Jack Dejohnette's foray into world music/electronica is fairly successful. I really like 1/2 of the songs and don't really care for the other half. The album gets a little bit to ""worldy"" for me at times and some of the tracks come off as cheesy. On other tracks there is a nice blend of world music and jazz bolstered by Dejohnette's drumming. Dubwise is particularly impressive. This is a good CD, but I can't imagine that this CD will Wow anybody."
3,Good info but cluttered,"Cappelletti offers solid strategy for Omaha 8/ play. In some places he suggests a very aggressive strategy (like raising with 3rd best hands to drive out 2nd best hands), which seems overboard for the average player. Additionally there is little to no advice for pot-limit or no-limit games (admittedly these games are relatively rare).The book could have used better editing. Many concepts and statement are repeated verbatim (as if the chapters were written separately and never edited when compiled into a complete book). The graphics depicting cards are also hard to read (you'll see 4 cards and 2 suits, and have to think a while to figure out which 2 cards are suited).If you want to learn the basic strategy for this relatively simple game (compared to hold'em which is much more difficult to play well) this is a good book to do so."
4,good,"Poker books are all good, but it is hard to find much good Omaha information. Enjoyable read and good information. Good book."
3,Into the winner's side,"After one reading, I turned a $40 weekly loss into a $40 gain. This was my first book on Omaha Hi Lo and with the dicipline to follow the guidelines, you can win too. However, you must study another source to learn profitable tournament rules. I do agree with the flaws identifed in earlier reviews: a) somewhat disorganized, b) too much print about ""other forms"" of poker, and c) leaves some common playing decisions unanswered. But there is enough solid advice to allow you to start getting actual playing time without it costing too much."
1,overrated,"Wow, is this thing ever overrated! Personally, I find a knife and a cutting board easier. This thing takes way more time to clean than it would to chop the old fashioned way. I really don't see what all the fuss is about."
5,The Best Garlic Press!,"This is the best garlic press I have ever used. Just put garlic right in without peeling and out comes perfect minced garlic, then just use included tool to put peels right in the garbage. I used to cut, peel with my fingers, get all that garlic all over my hands. It was a mess and a pain so I went to jarred garlic which just wasn't fresh. Now with this amazing kitchen tool the problem is solved. Leave it to Pampered Chef to come up with such a fantastic tool. Once you get one and use it, you'll wonder why you struggled before and how easy mincing garlic has become. Bravo to the Pampered Chef Garlic Press."
2,Disappointing,"Many of the pages in the first half of the book (""Basic Concepts"") are inappropriate if you are beginning phonics or working with young preschoolers. Examples: tracing/learning irregular words, e.g. circle, diamond, orange; teaching sight word reading...in a very tiny font sometimes (p.7); cutting out stars 1"" across.The second half of the book is OK for young preschoolers: tracing numbers and letters, simple dot-to-dots, and counting.If you purchase this for a young preschooler, start with the second half of the book and come back to the first half once your child is ready for sight words.I'm returning this in and getting The Comprehensive Curriculum of Basic Skills, Preschool instead."
5,Great book for preschoolers,Excellent source of learning for preschoolers. Easy to read and follow instructions make it parent friendly.
2,not as good as the original,"I saw the article from someone claiming that this product was not even close to the original(10 years ago cologne)Anyway I decided to buy one,and this person is right/I compared my new fragancy adquire, and my old one they are notsimilar."
2,Too detailed for a traveler,"I expected this book to give a brief history of the larger cities in Germany. It turned out to be a history book with too much detail. I had planned to take the book with me to Germany for references, but gave it away instead. I would label this book ""A brief history of Germany"", too long for travelers."
4,Peace-Science,This is a great book. It really helps to have a committed Christian provide his personal experience with the claims of faith vs the claims of science. Most of the book was very informative. My only issue was that there was just too much biology in this for my personal tastes. But I should expect that from a Biology college professor.
4,Nice book,"What is to say?This book is very good!Thank you Amazon! :)Looking forward for more great books with this subject: evolution - creation, science - religion."
5,Coming to Peace with Science,"This book was very helpful to me. It was written just how he speaks, so it's an easy read and difficult to put down. You can tell a lot of research and deep thought were the premise for this book. It is very informative, interesting, and thought provoking. I like how the ideas are brought up for consideration and not crammed down your throat. I now know how to answer those tough questions that were taboo for me to even consider as a child. Everyone should read this book!"
1,Another Theistic Book on the theory of evolution,"Another book trying to use science and man's wisdom to undermine the Word of God and His wonderful creation account. The author twists scriptures and finds the weakest scripture on science to disprove a literal 6 day creation. He fully embraces the theory of evolution as fact and tries to squeeze man's theistic theory of creation into God miraculous timing and means. Coming to Peace with science is only done by deconstructing the bible. The author does a wonderful job in trying to win your heart so that you will trust him, his theories and his twisted view of God's scriptures."
1,God is the Creator and He is the writer of Gensis not man,"I find this book very upsetting. Saying that the first part of Genesis is not believable but the words of evolution is? This is taking believers away from the Bible and bringing heresy to the Church. In 1 timothy 4:1-2 1.Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, 2.Speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron. 1 timothy 6:20-21 20.O Timothy! Guard what was committed to your trust, avoiding the profane and idle babblings and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge-- 21. By professing it some have strayed concerning the faith. This man is in error against the Bible and God"
3,never recevied book,I don't know how this book is. Amazon shipped to the wrong address and the never reimbursed me after they sent me an email that stated they would.
2,Convenient To Use But The Top Warps Easily,"The top is all plastic and even though it's rated to hold up to 50 lbs., you'll notice it sags in the middle with as little as a 7 pound laptop on it (that's what I use it for).I'd give it 5 stars for convenience if it weren't for this and the fact that the TableMate website has NO contact telephone number - and does NOT respond to e-mails inquiring about a replacement top - it's supposed to have a lifetime warranty against breakage, bending, etc.Mine has developed a permanent warp to the point that my mouse won't even lay flat. A steel shim molded into the top's perimeter lip would have made for a much more rigid design."
5,A timeless surfing collection,Bruce Jenkins does a phenomenal job bringing the reader to Hawaii's North Shore. His comfort level with the surfing community on the North Shore allows us entree into a world very few of us will experience and his does this with an eloqunce and immediacy that makes for compelling reading. This book belongs on the bookshelf of anyone interested in surfing in particular and anyone generally interested in well-told sports stories.The pictures give extra depth and provide credibility to the stories. Easily among the best written books about big wave surfing.
5,Wow!,I can't believe I didn't think of getting one of these sooner. No more kick-stand problems and bikes tipping over.
3,"works great for bikes with 26"" wheels",This rack can be assembled so the two bikes face the same direction or opposite directions. It hold mountain bikes with 26 in. wheels fine. It is a bit snug on 700c wheels though. 700c wheels tend to get stuck in the rack since the rack height is not sufficient.
5,"Excellent bike stand, especially for disc brakes","This bike stand is a steal! It is well made and my two Novara mountain bikes with disc brakes fit perfectly inside. I use it also to keep my bikes from falling over when I load them in my van. I realize that this is a specialized application, but for those to whom it applies rest assured that this light weight device works perfectly for that purpose. It was very inexpensive too, and that is a big plus for me!"
3,Not As Nice As Looks on Web,"To me, the packaging is ok, but glad the lamps are fine. It is a bit bigger than I expected, but fine with me. But, the shade is not as white as it shown and more like yellowish. Whiter will definitely looks better."
3,Entertaining and useful book with some limitations,"While the book generally does an outstanding job of deftly balancing good resarch and an entertaining style, it stumbles badly when west of the Mississippi. What happened to (at the least) Winston, or Powell? Neither one is in the index, and I could not find them in the text. The eastern U.S. bias is quite clear."
4,A Great Production,"This album is one of Frost's best. It seems that he puts a better album everytime and that his genius grows with time. The production of this album is better than good , but not great. The album starts off with a bang, but then as you get past the 13th song it starts to loose creativity. The lyrics though don't have the same result. Every song was thoughtfully written and that makes up for some of the weak productions at the end. In this album Frost seems to strand away from the barrio life and tries to concentrate on spiritually and the soul, but there are a couple songs that do show his rough side. Overall I recommend this album to his fans and those that want to get to know him better and see what all the hype is about."
5,This album is good and i recommend it to all the lowriders.,"This album is very good. Especially songs 1,3,4,10,and 13. This rapper has been rising since his first single ""La Raza"". Frost likes to speak to his listeners on his songs. He always is rapping about everday life in L.A. and how it really is out there. Just like he said on his song ""these stories have to be told"" from his album ""east side story""."
3,brightness,"the turn flash brightness is only as bright as the stock turn lights in running mode. more than a little disappointing, especially for the price. the good news is that if enough buyers bring this to cycle visions attention and let them know that we are buying this product to be more than just a novelty, but as a functional safety lighting accessory, they just may listen and use some brighter l.e.d.'s in the manufacture of this very nice looking product. i would definetly not eliminate my stock front run/turn lights and only use this product. it is just not bright enough."
2,Not impressed,"I wasn't impressed by these. They have no markings on them to indicate they're size. So unless you build some sort of holder for them and mark the size on the holder, you have no idea about the size.Also, they are the same size all around, which is fine for the larger blocks, but the smaller ones seem so fragile.Instead of these, I would get the Veritas set from Lee Valley. They cost more, but are clearly marked, have a 3-2-1 block, a case, and are all the same width, which makes stacking them for different sizes that much easier."
3,Meh,"I love eucalyptus, but the burning incense smells just like incense, not really like eucalyptus - or anything else for that matter."
4,model plane kit,"Christmas gift for grandson to give to my spouse; who was quite pleased. My spouse used to build these when he was a kid, so it's a nice ""trip"" to his childhood."
4,Ordered but haven't used yet,"I purchased these to use for a bathroom remodel, but haven't used them yet. I think they will work just fine. Delivery was very timely."
4,"Not bad, but similar item is at Target for $6.99","It's a very nice product, but I wish it has satin finished. Also Target is selling a similar item for $6.99, but I believe the quality on this is slightly better. Let's see how it holds up"
2,"Nice rings, wrong finish","I bought these rings to match everything else in my bathroom with the satin nickel finish (towel bar, sink hardware, shower hardware, robe hook, etc.). Unfortunately the rings have a chrome finish, not the satin nickel finish that is stated in the description and that is listed on the package. Maybe mine were packed incorrectly at the manufacturer? I don't know, I did receive a product that was described as satin nickel (it even said it on the package), but it was obviously a chrome finish."
4,Just what she wanted.,We were looking for some shower curtain hooks that were going to last. We're in the middle of redecorating our bathroom.
4,Great Album,"This is a really good albumThe songs are really heavy, yet still very melodic. This is a band that you should listen to if you like Pillar, Kutless, or 38th Parallel. It is one of my favorites (next to 12 Stones, relient k's sophomore taottic, and Kutless)."
2,In DVD format but dated and uninspiring,"I've seen Loretta LaRoche in person several times. While the content of her lectures is always the same, the DVD can't compare with the in-person delivery. Overall, I found the DVD uninspiring and long. Also, the production quality was not high - it was like I was watching something a friend had taped from PBS.I'm not discrediting Loretta LaRoche. I am recommending that if this is going to be your first experience, you try her newer DVD (which I haven't seen yet - but it's got to be better than this)."
5,Beautiful piece of metal,This burner is a very well cast piece. Looks like an original part. Used this in a rebuild of my 1998 era Broilmaster grill. Fit perfectly.
5,A great way to spend a half hour,"This video was a complete joy to watch. It gave my daughter a real glimpse of what its like to ride and care for a pony. I am refreshed and encouraged that my 7 year old has a ""real"" person to look up and aspire to. Addison Phillips comes accross as a hard working and gracious yet formidiable competitor. My only complaint is that the video is too short...I wanted to see more, more, more. I would reccomend this tape to anyone who loves horses and wants to see what it's like to be an equestrian. The build up to the horse show was enjoyable and the excitement of the event was exciting and entertaining. My only question is why do you show it as a CD when it is a video?"
3,Toastmaster okay,"It does the job for the price. Smashes the bread too thin, makes the edges too hard. I use it in my office for quick lunches, but would not purchase another."
2,not for people who love sandwiches,this is poorly made and broke within a month. can only handle small thin square bread. will not work for better breads which are 50% larger. extra portion will pinch off and burn. can only deal with thin sandwiches which are not worth the effort. generally made sandwich taste like rubber. clamp closer snapped off soon after purchase.
1,Peeling Plates,"After only a few months use, the nonstick finish is coming off and toasting onto the sandwich - quite disgusting. Because of this I cannot recommend this item, and I will be looking for another brand."
2,Not easy to clean,"We thought this would be a great product to try new sandwiches with our kids. But, the sandwiches come out with flat crunchy edges (burnt looking). If you use cheese, it dries around the edges of the sandwich maker and is very hard to scrape off. I just wasn't impressed with this product."
4,pearls,I am delighted with these pearls. Am not a jewelry expert but have a good natural eye and I really like the way these look. They are very light colored (not beige or pink) and bright and pretty against my neck and clothing. And a good length. Very pleased.
5,very elegant,"delighted with my purchase, they hang perfectly and look so elegant, they are not to small or to big just the right size!"
5,This was the book on electromagnetics I'd been looking for.,"I am a amateur radio operator and have degrees in mathematics. I was looking for a book that would show the derivation of the equations but also give a good feel for what they mean. Although the ""proofs"" in this book do not go down to as fine a detail as possible, I found it has just the right depth to keep focused on the meaning of the equations.After grinding through the text and working all the exercises I am now in a position to usefully read deeper works. I was particularly happy that the book derives the equations for the field due to a short dipole (three different ways!) and also gives the basics of waveguides. These are very important to those interested in radio communications.I can now see why Rojansky was a legend where he taught."
1,Lacking of content,"The author talks of electromagnetics but he barely touches on how they work, he just talks of the concepts and future possibilities. He should rewrite it for us ""Dumber"" readers."
5,easy and fast,What a great book; great reading and wonderful tasting foods. the ricotta cookies are to die for. The canoli and filling is like grandma's. The vegatarian Minestroni was easy and very flavorful. A great crock pot soup!
4,An amazing xbox game.,"From what I saw in the gameplay videos, this game looked awesome, but a friend of mine urged me to stay away from it. Now that I have played it, I say that it is one of the best xbox games I have ever played. It blends first person/third person shooting with fighting games. The graphics are cool, the story line is decent, and best of all, it succeeds where UT2004 failed. There are new elements in this game that are tremendous fun, such as one gametyper, where you must seize radioactive spheres and deliver them to the goals before someone steals it. This is different from UT2004, where some gametypes that seemed like a good idea turned out to be mediocre.I suggest you buy this game!"
5,awesome game,i love this game the dueling and championship i wish they make a lot more like this unfortunately the unreal champ 3 is much worse
4,Great Unreal Title,"Great Game!I really miss this style of game as everything delves more and more into FPS territory, fewer developers are going through the motions enough to produce stuff that's as fun as this. Especially online! Unfortunately, there is no longer a way to do it over xbox live, but dont let that deter you from playing over a LAN with some friends and let it rip!Pluses- Great graphics for xbox- Fast gameplay utlizing melee game-changers- Fatalities- Voiceovers from the Mortal Kombat voice- Raiden??Minuses- Some weapons are kinda weak- Online is no longer around unless you want to put in the work"
2,Not A Fan!!!,The game got here fast but I just was not that intrested in it. I ordered this game on word of mouth. Next time I will do my homework.
2,What happened??,"What happened to Unreal? This used to be THE shooter. Now its just become a mess. The single player is annoying, you can only play Anubis and he SUX!!. The melee really falls short. If your not a tank then you die really quick. The combos are laughable, all you do is hold the right trigger and hope you don't die before the other guy. The weapons which I thought would be the shining light are horrible. The only one that does enough damage to make a difference is the Rocket launcher which gets old really quick. What is with the Nalhi hunt, how lame do you want to be. I don't care about Xbox live because all its gonna be is people jumping around like idiots, with that ""unpresedented mobility"" firing rockets at each other. I really tried to like this game but it just isn't any fun. And a game should be fun."
5,Tied with Halo 2!,"This is one of the best games in the world!It has over 12 characters each one unique in their own way.Xbox Live is just awesome and single player's not so bad.The game has a variety of game modes including the classic capture the flag,deathmatch,etc.They even have new ones like Nali Slaughter(a mode where you have to kill a race known Nali faster than your oppenent to win)which is wicked awesome!I totally reccommend this game to anyone.Midway has done it again!"
1,bah,played this on xbox live for 5 minutes and turned it off. can't believe i paid $50 for this crap. halo 2 owns UC2
1,Inappropriately titled,"On ordering this book, I was hoping to find a discussion on why someone would convert to another religion, and how that affected their view on life. Instead, it was an 83-page sermon. Not really a story of conversion, but a series of metaphorical ramblings of a born-again christian."
5,Wonderful Insights Found Nowhere Else,"Francesco Alberti said, ""The merit of a book must be measured by its usefulness."" This book has miles and miles and miles and miles and miles of usefulness. That's why it's continued to be published for more than 60 years.I don't care if you've read the complete works of Eckart Tolle. You still don't know anything about being present until you've read and understood this book. If you want to learn how to improve your waking conscious life, understand what obstacles exist to that end. There are mainly three obstacles: imagination, inner considering, and negative emotions. P.D. Ouspensky explains these major obstacles in detail, but it will be up to you to observe them in your own life, in your own imagination, in your own mind.Be careful, however, in seeking out additional assistance. Avoid The Fellowship of Friends, sometimes known as Pathways to Presence. It's not an official Ouspensky or Gurdjieff school and it won't teach you more than what's in this book."
1,Toastess Coffee Maker,"This was the worst item I have ever bought. The very first time I used it, I had a hard time pressing the button to the On position. When I finally got it to go to On position the switch burned out and smoked."
1,Not worth the money,"Pros: It makes coffeeCons:1. It's flimsy2. The on-off switch is difficult to use. It is placed low down on the side and not very obvious. It doesn't switch off automatically so it's easy to leave the unit switched on3. It takes a long time to make coffee, and the coffee is barely warm when finishedSummary:Spend a few more $$s and get a Black and Decker!"
4,simple for one,Bought as a gift for my Mom who is not tecnically blessed. She found it simple to use. For her liking the water did not get hot enough so we found starting with hot tap water and the cup of coffee was steaming hot to her complete satisfaction.
1,Works but Disappointing,"This is an attractive looking item and it DOES make one cup of coffee. However, it is very slow compared to my previous Black and Decker. Also, it does not shut off automatically like the B & D. With this one, I have time to take my pre-breakfast pills, get the morning paper and check my e-mail while it is brewing. Not all bad, I guess!"
4,Great little coffee pot,"happy with the results, coffee is hot just the way I like it, takes up little space and you can have one cup anytime you want, no waste"
2,one cup coffee maker,"Not very happy with this product. Had one many years ago and since it is no longer available I purchased this one. The coffee is not hot and it takes too long to make. I use it only when it is essential to my time allotment, however, the older model (which I still have and am unwilling to give up) makes hot coffee and does it much quicker. Sorry to say I wish they made the older model again."
2,Disappointed,"The product was not as suggested per the review of features. It was very slow, did not have a basket that would accomodate an insert filter and did not get the coffee as hot as I was accustomed to. I have already returned it for a credit."
1,Broke after first use,"Sorry to say this was a dud. Brewed one cup of coffee, then made the mistake of rinsing the reservoir and that was it. Must have fizzled out a wire. Even unscrewed the back, but all components appeared secure. Just wouldn't work again."
2,"Great idea, poor quality","Great idea for small spaces, I only wish the quality of the product was better. This little coffee pot does make a decent cup of coffee, but because it is so cheaply made it will not last long."
2,not what it appeared to be,"I purchased this single cup coffee maker and was very dissatisfied with the product. It is very lightweight, and really small. In the picture, it appears to be sturdy, and a little larger. Gave it away, as I found it to be not what I expected!Thanks,Anna"
2,1 Cup Coffeemaker,"Coffeemaker is a bit too small. Although it arrived in working condition, the box was torn to shreds."
1,Cheap!,The plate actually has Batman decals that come off in the dishwasher. This plate set didn't hold up as well as others I've purchased.
4,Big Wimp Ending for Big Bad John,"This would of been 5 stars, but I am unhappy to report (contrary to previous reviews) the version of Big Bad John on this CD ends with the phrase, ""At the bottom of this mine lies a big, big man.... Big John"". I bought this CD expecting to get the original ""lies one hell of a man"" version. It really does detract from a great song I've enjoyed listening to for more than 30 years. The other 9 songs on this CD are awesome! It's a great value even with the lame ending of Big Bad John."
5,Music Brought Back some good memories,My order came quickly and was in perfect condition. I thoroughly enjoyed all the CDS from this artist.
5,Jimmy Dean: Big Bad John,Loved the album. When I was young we had this record and I think that this is a compilation of at least two albums.
3,dissappointed...,"I love to see Dee doing projects on The Carol Duvall show so I bought this book and her first book.Sadly-Dee's teaching skills are much better on film than in a book.Dee's project are very involved and multi layered-but with just a small paragraph per project-it is almost impossible for all but the most experienced stamper to follow.Another problem is that both books start out very complicated-there is no simple projects to warm up on.While I love color-anyone who tends to like more muted tones will be overwhelmed by the bold, almost dizzying use of color in Dee's work-and probably turned off because there are no other versions shown-just the very colorful depictions so it is hard to envision these projects in any other way.I do understand the Dee has a couple of instructional DVD's out-I would suggest that you get those and learn her techniques on film before tackling her books.3 stars."
5,Product As Advertised,A set of 6 stackable plastic desk trays at an amazing price. Each tray has 4 small tabs on the bottom that fit into matching slots on the top of the tray beneath. Perfect for the home office.
3,This is a good read,"This is an early book about John Wesley and as such is dated. It does provide some good information and is easy reading for those interested in Wesley.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
3,"Decent fit, doesnt seem to make a huge difference, but i like the concept","The only thing wrong with it is that it slightly pushes down the air dam, so you can sorta tell something is behind it when looking at the front of the truck. The only other bad thing i noticed is that there is no drain holes for water and it does step down into the scoop so when it rains/ car wash, or anything wet, water sits in there until it drys. It does seem like it should do its job, it may interfere with larger tires and does look like a huge growth when looking into the pasenger fender well."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was having a conversation with a friend of mine recently and mentioned that with the revolutionary gesture control possibilities with the Wii, it should be worth getting a Wii just for Avatar. Unfortunately, gestures from the show aren't really employed. Furthermore, I'm a fan of the show and the game doesn't follow anything that makes sense in the show's storyline whatsoever. I was looking forward to traveling the world mastering the elements as Ang in my living room making the gestures myself, but it just doesn't work out that way. In my opinion the game would probably have been more fun 10 years ago and for someone that hadn't seen the show. The Wii is still great, however."
3,Its goodo,"Its a fun game, just wish we could do more in it. But I love the variety of powers Aang and his friends get."
4,Classic midnight love,"If anybody hasn't listened to Portugese In Love or Yes Indeed, then be prepared for some classic love music. These tracks will just blow you away. Soft mellow vibes to melt away those loving nights."
3,"Value-centered, but overly repetitive","I enjoyed the main premis of this book-- focusing on value generation and the total commercial process, more business than technology. However, I felt the concept did not fully sustain itself throughout the book. Good points-- focus on customer's perception of value, rather than business's view, use of partnering with world class service providers. I would have liked perhaps a couple of more in-depth case studies, rather than tidbits that were offered. Also, some pointers on how to set of measurement systems that would support creation of value networks & custoemr focus."
4,bob dylan;artist,a lot of special clips here..great songs written and performed by bob dylan as only he can do them
3,"ALSO, mad about lack of mayfield....and others","I also was disappointed when I ASSUMED that Curtis Mayfield and ""she's a lady"" would be on the Soundtrack of ""Bend it like Beckham"" and bought it without looking to see if they were there. I was very disappointed to find out these songs were not included!!!"
5,Unbelievable,"Wow!! I haven't seen a quality movie like this is years!!! The direction, acting and the writing of this film was incredible!! Kudos to all involved!!!"
4,Recommended,"This album has a mix of Indian and ""Western"" music. A few weak songs by ex-Spice Girls, but the rest fun, dance-oriented tracks."
2,mad about lack of mayfield,"I loved the movie and bought this soundtrack because of all the great music in the film, but especially because of a few certain songs: curtis mayfield's ""move on up,"" the remix of ""she's a lady"" by tom jones, and two techno songs which may or may not be basement jaxx and baddest ruffest (i don't know).I was very angry to find that all FOUR of these songs (in my opinion some of the best songs in the film) were NOT included in the soundtrack. Although the two dance songs are on the UK release, neither release has the mayfield or the tom jones. Although the other songs are very catchy and fun, these songs made the movie."
4,Dream the Dream,"I bought an imported version because it has more on it, and it's a fantastic disc with amazing-sounding songs on it that compliment and add a wonderful dimension to the movie, but like a lot of people, I'm disappointed that it doesn't include other songs, so I've been looking for them. The one song that I can't seem to find anywhere is Dream the Dream by Shaznay Lewis. I havn't found it on any file-sharing networks or on the internet. I found out some copyright info about it, but it looks like it was only recorded for this movie but never released in any form. Most of the information I know about it I got off of IMDB.com [...]I know lots of people are looking for this song, so if anyone has it or knows where to find it, please let us know!! You'll definatly be very appreciated! Thanks, [...]"
4,Best song help I can give . . .,To everyone who is in search of a song from the movie go to this link for a scene by scene song list:http://imdb.com/title/tt0286499/board/nest/224815I hope this helps.
4,Bend it Like Beckham,I needed the CD in a timely manner and it was sent very quickly. CD was in perfect shape. Thanks.Bend It Like Beckham
4,MISSING SONG!!,"If you've watched the movie, theres the part where Jess pretends shes sick and when she takes her housecoat to sneak off to her soccer game. The song that plays during that part! I NEED IT! i keep hearing it everywhere and no one seems the to knwo the title of that song! COUDL SOMEONE PLEASE!!!!! TELL ME WHAT IT IS! i've been lookign fo rit for 2 years! thansk alot. by the way the reast of these songs are aweosme! haha"
4,Really Cool,"very nice songs, i'm not indian but i love their music, i wish there were more songs from the movie on the cd."
4,"For ALL 22 Tracks, but it at Amazon.co.uk!!!","I bought this soundtrack while waiting for my plane at London's Heathrow Airport. I noticed that my cd has 22 tracks on it, while the American release only has 14...my suggestion is to purchase it at Amazon.co.uk where you can get the European relaese...it has the missing songs most other reviewers were looking for. The CD is awesome...but I'm taking away 1 star for the inclusion of Nessun Dorma. It's a beautiful operatic song but it doesn't seem to belong on this soundtrack."
4,"Good, but missing a few must-haves","This is a great collection of songs from an equally great movie, a perfect mix of Eastern and Western music. Sadly there are several missing tracks, that would have made the album perfect. These include: Move on Up by Curtis Mayfield, Baddest Ruffest by Backyard Dog, Do Your Thing by Basement Jaxx, She's a Lady (remix) by Tom Jones, and the ever, impossible to find Dream the Dream by Shaznay Lewis. This last one is unrelased material, that plays when Jess is hanging laundry, a great song, that I can't find anywhere. If these tracks had been on the album, no doubt it would have been perfect."
3,If this had been the first book I'd read?,"I am a huge James Patterson fan and love the Alex Cross and the Women's Murder Club series.However, I found this book hard to follow and had to keep backtracking to check on characters.The chapters were much longer than I'm used to from Mr. Patterson, which I have no problem withbut the book lacked the cohesiveness of his later novels. In all honesty if this had been myfirst experience with Mr. Patterson, I don't know if I'd have been interested in reading more ofhis novels. Fortunately that was not a problem and I now have more James Patterson's novels onmy Kindle than any other author. Keep up the great work."
1,Worst of James Patterson's books -1 star,"I have read over 50 of Patterson's books. Loved some,enjoyed most. This is the worst book of all his efforts. I skipped many parts. It jumps all over the place, introduces characters with no place in the plot and in general it was a great waste of my time!!!!! It doesn't deserve a star. I put one in to put in my review."
3,Author's first published was rough,The first effort from this author rough and hard to follow for me. But I thought he must have something to offer with all his recent acclaim and sales. I am now reading his 2nd book and it already an easier read.
3,James Patters,The Thomas Berryman Number is very different for James Patterson I had a hard time getting into it at first. Then I couldn't put it down stayed up all night.
1,Loss of life book not main character,I cannot believe Mr. Patterson in any way participated in authoring this book. It was very poorly written and dull. the characters and plot were shallow and underdeveloped despite the length of the book. I am an avid Patterson reader but I wasted my time and money on this one.
1,A Difficult Read,"This was a disjointed and confusing story. By the time I came to the end, I really didn't care how it all came about"
1,Thank God James Patterson's writing abilities have improved.,"I rate this a 2. I have read almost all of his other books, all rate 6 to 10(Kiss the Girls). This book really was horrible, I forced myself to read it to the end, hoping for a miracle. Alas it did not happen. This book was written in the 70's and well the 70's sucked and so did this book."
1,"Boring, disjointed, and confusing","I went to a tremendous amount of trouble to get this book via interlibarary loan and what a disappointment. I enjoy the implications that I'm too plebian to enjoy such a rich and deep work of art. I can enjoy a sophisticated, subtle plot as much as the next yahoo, but this is horrible."
1,So disappointing!!,"I usually like James Patterson but this book was absolutely horrible. Not only was it hard to follow, but I never ended up caring about any of the characters. I can't believe he was able to get this published AND win an award. I guess I just don't get it."
1,a disappointment,"I enjoy the excitement of the Alex Cross stories. This book, on the other hand, was slow paced and hard to follow. The only reason I finished the book, was that I was waiting for that James Patterson twist at the end, which did not come. I do not recommend this book."
3,OK for a Summer Read,"This book is light on suspense and not what would be considered ""a page turner"" or a book that just could not be put down until finished. It is mediocre but still entertaining and I don't regret spending a couple of days reading it. The outcome is predictable with no surprises but growing up in the 60's, I could see MLK and RFK all over it. It really gives one a sense of the turbulent times back then. Being a Texas transplanted to Tennessee, I could actually relate to some of the idioms. Good read, just not heavyweight intense stuff."
1,I want my money back!,"Since the worst rating possible is a 1, I suppose I can't give it what I think is more accurate, about a -10. THE MOST HORRIBLE BOOK I HAVE EVER READ (my mother agrees!). Please, save your money and throw it in the gutter before shelling it out for this particularly horrible, unintelligible, degrading to the literate, book! But, that is just my opinion (and my mother's)."
1,Not so good,"Not what I expect from James Patterson. It was a bit hard to follow, the story was ok. I read James Patterson books all the time and love them. This disappointed me. :("
5,Get this book,"This was James Patterson's first. If you can find it, it was once titled under a different name! (Some research for you fans)."
1,Ho Hum,"I agree with ""don't bother."" I've read many of the Alex Cross novels and enjoy the page turning pace of these novels. I couldn't keep track of what was going on and after 100 pages was totally lost. Maybe my psyche was lost in it's thoughts about ...""is this really Patterson?"""
1,Waste of time and effort.,In today's world our time is very precious and valuable. Do not waste your time or your money for that matter on this book. Forgive Patterson for this one. He makes up for it with some other rather exceptional writings.
3,"Entertaining Story, Bad Southern Dialogue","This is a fast-paced, suspenseful, and angular tale, but the ending becomes apparent about halfway through. I recommend it because it's entertaining and fun to read.Patterson definitely understands pacing, but he needs to study local dialects a little more. People in Nashville don't talk like people from the deep south. When he writes his Nashville characters' words in dialect form, he makes them sound like they are from Georgia or Alabama. People native to middle Tennessee have Appalachian tinged accents for the most part. (Of course the degree varies based on region, schooling, and so forth). Appalachian speakers drag their words out more, they don't clip them or round them off like folks from the deep south. I know because I have many relatives in Tenn. What he did was akin to giving a Minnesota native a Chicago accent."
3,A fast read.,"I was drawn to this one because it won an Edgar for Best First Novel. As a James Patterson fan I went in ready to be bowled over. While not my favorite from Mr. Patterson, this is a satisfying read. Certainly worthwhile just to get the history of his writings.Like everything I have read from Mr. Patterson, this one read extremely fast. It took me a little while to put faces on the main characters, and I am not certain that I was 100% successful in that task. I got to know them pretty well, and found the plot set up most engaging...it kept me on my toes.Somehow ""The Thomas Berryman Number"" had a feel somewhat like ""The Anderson Tapes""---at least to me. It certainly had me turning pages.I have to recommend reading this one if you are a James Patterson fan. It takes little time due to his flowing writing style, and give you a sense of where he started. Surely I plan to get a hold of more of his earlier works. Mr. Patterson gets your attention and moves the story at a good pace."
2,Why Didn't I Listen to the other reviews!!!,"Not much else I can really say. Read the other reviews posted and that sums it up. Unreadable. I don't think that the 'language' in this book was meant to be Southern style talk, but more like an ill, stereotypical attempt at ebonics. (This trend continues on in Patterson's writing career as those of you who have read every Alex Cross novel know what I mean.)I thought I was going to take a shot at all of Patterson's books since they are such basic 1-2 day reads and generally keep my interest. Those plans progressively changed as I moved along in the Cross novels and 'Berryman' may just prevent me from ever picking up one of his books again."
1,Another fine mess,"This novel is such a mess that it is unworthy of serious comment. Rather, it calls to mind 2 questions:(1) How on earth did this ever get published?(2) What tasteless literary jury gave this an edgar for a first novel?Don't waste your time on this. I pushed myself to read about 100 pages of it and it never got any better."
2,not best work,"In spite of enjoying most Patterson fiction and in spite of enjoying Will Patton readings of contemporary authors, this set is a dud. Not Patterson's best work and even Will Patton's reading cannot save this from being a work best not listened to in traffic or while operating heavy machinery. ZZZZZ."
5,Memoirs of Glueckel of Hameln,"Fascinating description of an educated Jewish woman's life in the 1600's with an amazing amount of travel in Northern Europe pertaining to family matters and business. It was not a small world by any means. She was a bit effusive in her thanks and acceptance of her life with moralising, but her description of her life is outstanding."
4,Very interesting,"In 1690, Gluckel of Hameln decided to write her memoirs, intending to have them read only by her children. She was an unknown woman then, and is known today only because she wrote her memoirs. Reading her memoirs gives one a chance to see the life of common (yet somewhat upper class) people. She talks about having fourteen children, working with her husband buying and selling seed pearls, how the Jews lived in northern Germany, how she viewed reactions to Shabbatai Tzvi the false messiah, arranging matches for her children, traveling, etc. After my Jewish women's book discussion book read it, we all agreed that we did not find the book an easy or enjoyable read, but we all felt that it was very interesting."
3,Pre-bot era floor trading techniques,Summary from my full length review - A book that captures the pre-bot era floor trading techniques with ideas that the readers have to confirm themselves as I found many of the ideas do not show enough bias to be used as-is.
1,Lots of print but empty words,I can't believe any publisher would allow this hodgepodge of gibberish to pass the scrutiny of a professional editor. I program trading systems for a living and attempt to find ideas in books i read. I have a thirst for knowledge and I consider my time to be valuable and not to wasted on worthless banter and self promotion. I violated both in this instance. I have learned a good lesson. I am embarrassed for fear others who research my ideas to learn I actually conducted a seminar in Chicago and had the stupidity to invite this author to speak. it was empty words in his speech just like this book. I returned and got my money back. mark b.
1,Poor Presentation With Empty Writing,"Not only does this book have nothing of value for a ""real"" trader, but it is also a spelling and grammar mess. I woulnd't be surprised if the writer never attended high school and never traded for himself in real life. He fails to grasp the intricacies of how the markets really operate. I believe it was an effort to establish himself as a credible factor in the investment business and if this is the best it is falls far short of what a part time trader could write with little effort. Stay away from this book and get a Larry Williams book instead!! At least you will learn something of value."
3,A Hype Artist With Suprisingly Decent Info,"I am not a big fan of this book. Though the chapters on 4th time breakouts and T-Bond auctions as well as a few others are informative for the novice. Some of his ""tips"" or ""tricks"" such as ""Healthy Leads to Wealthy"" or ""Be Smarter Than Your Computer"" are downright filler chapters. Weintraub is not a big time trader or scalper or spreader or whatever you want to call it. I think the fact that he included phone numbers of some of the various individuals who proffered tips is very, very, cheesy!! Typically, anyone who markets any kind of ""how to trade"" course is not a trader but a salesperson, they may have some decent info but nothing that will really help you. I am afraid that Weintraub falls into this category. His friend Grant Noble on the other hand, has written a far superior book."
1,Utter garbage!,"I can't believe Neal has written such worthless tripe. I have spoken to him and he has represented that he was and is an experienced, successful, big time trader. He talks like a know-it-all and writes like one as well. At least he is consistent. What a poser. I am a part timer in the investment business but my knowledge far exceeds this impostor's. Try as he may, he must be having difficulty trading because he has knack for selling his empty ideas. The one or two threads of modest value were copied from the work of others and I even think he borrowed a few of mine but mine were certainly better and valuable. My bestr recommendation is stay away from anything this guy is hawking."
1,this book is waste of money,"i've traded all my life and this book adds nothing to the basic knowledge a person could acquire just by reading a newspaper. the author comes across as a pompous know it all when in fact many ideas he attempts to express are in- correct and will lead a beginner astray. he representss throughout the book that he is an accomplished trader when in truth he merely traded for awhile on the midamerica or baby exchange. it's unfortunate that the author did not present some wothwhile ideas for traders but i think the only was he could acquire them would be read expereinced traders' books, since he obviously is not one. it was a total mistake buying this book. other than as a doorstop, its worthless."
4,Excellent memoir of Beatles' Apple Corps years,"This is an excellent memoir of the author's times in the Beatles Apple corps press office from 1968-1970. It successfully evokes - albeit somewhat crazily - the highs and lows of the Apple corps ideals and attempts at helping impoverished artists along. Funny and sad, cleverly written, evocative of the times, with a few Beatle anecdotes thrown in for good measure. Dilello especially provides a brilliant portrait of Beatles and Apple press officer Derek Taylor, and describes as well briefly some of the other Apple execs like Neil Aspinall, Mal Evans, Peter Brown and nasty Allen Klein. Reproduces contemporary news accounts to highlight big events, and has a decent chronology at end. Wally Podrazik's preface adequately describes the purpose of the book - - to give Americans a feel of the Beatles in London during the Apple period, which Mr. Dilello does very well here. Recommended!"
4,Good read,"I am still reading this book, but I find it to be very interesting and funny in some part. It's always good to hear the story from someone who was actually there but is unbiased. I say this book is definately worth the time, so check it out."
3,A mixed bag - but still worth it,"As you read this nostalgic artifact of a bygone era you realize that the author really never met or got to know any of The Beatles! So anyone looking for that kind of intimate insight into these artists' lives at this turbulent time is out of luck. The closest it comes is an in-depth portrayal of the charismatic Derek Taylor, The Beatle's legendary press agent. Also, unfortunately (but possibly for legal reasons) the author provides pages of dialogue without ever identifying who is saying what! I know, I know, you're ready to kiss it off. But taking its weaknesses in stride, if you want a fly-on-the wall, somewhat sly account of the day in and day out weirdnesses at Apple's 15 minute empire, then you'll have a jolly good time with this one."
4,an unconventional view,"This is not exactly a traditional look at historic subjects, a comprehensive biography - or anything like it.What this is, is a taste of what it was like to be in the midst of the heady days of the Beatles' Apple Corps. We get to meet, hear and see an ever-changing cast of strange characters, bits of juicy gossip, weird goings-on and the like.DiLello makes no effort to be comprehensive, detailed or offer any scholarly insights. That's not what this book is about, nor for. It's a recollection of his time in what happened to be the pop music hotspot of the 60s, and nothing more. For that, he's done a terrific job of re-creating the times, and this is a book that might not open any new areas of scholarship, but is really about as much fun reading as you can find."
4,The Decline and Fall of '60's Pop Idealism,"I guess there are times this book is funny but I found it to be EXTREMELY sad. Apple was intended by the Beatles to be a clearing house for creativity but the Apple management lacked vision and organizational abilities. As a result the whole enterprise was a money wasting disaster that raised a lot of people's expectations and delivered only one English folkie and the short-lived band 'Badfinger'. James Taylor, discovered by Apple, was mismanaged and ultimately had to leave in order to start his career!To me one of the most illuminating passages in the story is when DeLillo describes hopeful photographers presenting their portfolios for consideration at the press office, unaware that in reality all photo contracts were handled through old-fashioned cronyism. And the press office was the closest thing to effectiveness at Apple! And boxes of mouldering poetry in the 'black hole' closet..."
3,"An entertaining read, but little else","Of all the Beatles books I've ever read, this one is hands-down the oddest. Not an exhaustively checked fact fest, but more of a space cadet memoir, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Richard Dilello was the ""house hippie"" at the Beatles Apple offices, a position that allowed him a ringside seat for what had to be one of the most entertaining, misguided, and heartbreaking business ventures ever conceived. It has its moments, quite a few of them actually, but the whole thing is awash in a tide of sadness because we all know how things turned out in the end."
1,Cost to much I think.,"I think that the price is to much for this computer desk. I think $100.00 would be a good price, but I do not think that $200 or $300 is reasonable.I would get a bigger desk for the same amount of money that you will spend on this desk."
1,Don't buy this,"This is just a cheapened, cut up version of ""Live: A Benefit for Maryville Academy"".This is the WORST kind of artist rip-off of fans, giving no indication you're buying the same thing, you've already bought."
3,make sure you have good lighting!!!,"When I read about how this game worked, it sounded ingenious! It's much like Connect Four but takes it a step further by trying to make a row with secondary colours with 2-tiled primary colours. However, it was hard to distinguish the secondary colours, for example, blue and yellow making green. From the blue side, it looked more blue and from the yellow side, it looked more yellow. You need good lighting to play this game! If the makers could improve on this colour matching, then it'd be a great game."
2,Very Hard To Identify Colors,Unless the light is almost perfect it's extremely hard to identify when colors are being combined into another one.
3,Echoing the storage issue!,"Thanks to the previous reviewer for confirming that I was not missing something obvious in terms of how to store this once assembled! [It *is* possible to unscrew the base, with an eyeglass screwdriver, but not sensible.]And yes: bright light is definitely needed. My 6 year-old son loved it, though."
5,Transporting,"I am so glad I was able to listen to selections from this album, and it has been a delight to listen to. Transporting me from my desert home to the lovely tropical shores."
4,"We think it works but, not on seagulls",As far as we can see it keeps the geese off our dock but it does not efect the seagulls or ducks. They still want to land on the docks.
1,Disappointed,Very cheap for price! Photo on styrofoam and will possibly blow into next county with first good wind. Did not like!
4,Not bad for the 3rd one.,This movie was actually better than I expected after some of the negative reviews I saw before buying it. I thought the first two had good story lines and this one fits. If you enjoyed the first two I think you'll like it.
3,Love Dogs,I love shephards. these two work great together and act like they have lived together their entire lives.
1,"K-9: P.I., you bring shame to your ancestors","A horrible sequel to a movie that was a moderate success 13 years ago! The DVD cover has lots of police tape on it saying ""Police line, do not cross,"" it also shows Jim Belushi taking a bath with his dog. I think that's the line that should not be crossed. Implied beastiality, poop jokes and so much more dreck have convinced me that we lost the wrong Belushi. If you buy this, they'll just make more of these horrible movies, and I will curse you until the end of time."
5,beautiful holiday table ware,I am always so pleased when I receive my order. Packed to a mm of its life and in perfect condition. The estimated arrival time is always spot on too.This gorgeous table ware will serve my family for many Christmas's to come.
2,book series used at my university,"This book probably won't help you if you're studying Korean on your own. It's different from the earlier books in the series in that it doesn't give 2 or 3 pages per grammar point, but rather a short paragraph and a few examples. There's a lot more vocabulary, but the chapter themes are odd (a story about how the original coke bottle was designed, a traditional Korean story about a jewel-eating goose) and so a lot of the vocab is useless in real life."
2,But Hellblazer is not about this stuff anyhow,"Hm. How can I tell you my opinion about this book without spoiling it? Hmm. Let's try like this.Hellblazer is not about this kind of stories. Not normally.This is a very dark tale about desperate men and women in a desperate town - and the impossibility of saving them from themselves.Sounds good, isn't it?Unfortunately, John Constantine (the main character) really doesn't fit in this tale, and all the efforts to turn the story into something ""Hellblazerish"" repeatedly fail. Worse than that, they turn the tale into pastiche with all that forced and unnecessary imagery of disturbing, dead and corrupted stuff.Oh. And the basic premise for the story is waaaay improbable, as soon as you stop to ponder it, and really just a gimmick to inject some (well, quite a lot of) shock value in the book.Not excessively bad, but Hellblazer is another kind of stuff."
5,Great Find,"The actor in this movie Lee White was my wife's Great Grand Father and we had no idea it had been moved to DVD. It was a joy to find it. Without the connection I'm not sure I would have been interested in it, (I'm not a fan of old westerns) But for what it is it's great. It really shows how far film-making and our society has come. It was amazing to see how Jack Elam got his start and the young girl gained fame later on on Star Trek. This movie has opened a new interest for me, that of finding now famous actors at their very beginning."
4,"If you have difficulty with more ""high brow"" Italian fare...this is for you.","""The 10th Victim"" is a tour-de-force of crazed 1960s filmmaking and is an evening's entertainment to be remembered. The inventive but anemic premise revolves around a pre ""Running Man"" competition amongst televised assassins and their prey, and how during a final round two of them fall for each other. Honestly, you aren't going to watch the movie for its story. This is more like ""The Italian Job"" on amphetamines, or an ""I Dream of Jeannie"" episode stuck in a Cuisinart with ""The Conformist"". Some absolutely brilliant visual gags and comic set-ups. Five stars for the art direction and all of the creative energy -- but the lack of chemistry between Mastroianni & Andress, the meandering plot, and untamed screwball Sci-Fi explain its relative obscurity."
3,Curious movie,"This movie in true scifi form was quite ahead of its time as far as its theme goes, a tv show in which contestants become assassins of each other and earn a living that way. Last few years, a couple of American movies were made around the same topic. However, they don't have Ursula Andress and Marcello Mastroianni in it and that wonderful 60's wacky visual interpretation of what the future would look like.Will it ever go this far on tv to satisfy the ever increasing and by the media itself ever stimulated need for thrills and kicks, without which people don't seem to be able to sense they're alive anymore or so we're given to believe? The cynical me and optimistic me have not finished that debate as yet to give an answer.The acting in this movie is not exactly mindblowing and the movie's main subject is not exactly deeply explored, but it has a lot of curiosity value in that it is rather unique in its depiction of what may be in store for us and is quite entertaining at that."
4,Machine gun jumblies,This must be where mike Meyers got the fembot weaponry! Great cult classic! Lots of cool scenes and propsStrange but cool movie
3,Before there was an Austin Powers,"This film is fresh from the 1960's, a Carlo Ponti film. Carlo had Sophia Loren for some time so he was no stranger to beauty. Ursula Andress was one of the great European seductresses in the 1960's and 1970's. If you are a fan of hers, her role basically is a scene right out of Austin Powers in the 1st four minutes where she struts her stuff in a metallic bikini and then, right out of Powers, removes a foe with her deadly upper bikini guns. Though Ursula was nonpareil as a beauty, the scene is better reprised by Austin Powers.The film is typical of 1960's European spy fare: feather light plots with odd twists and campy 1960's clothing and 'mod behavior'.If you absolutely love the craziness of Euro films from the 60's, or must have anything with Ursula Andress, then get this--otherwise look for better choices."
2,The 10th Victim,"A catastrophic misfire on all levels, Director Elio Petri's The 10th Victim should be shown in film schools across the world as part of a course elective called ""Everything That Is Wrong With Italian '60s pop art Cinema"".It isn't interesting, it isn't engaging and it isn't remotely frightening, it isn't Futuristic, it isn't sci-fi, and it isn't a dark comedy.It was almost thirty years before I actually saw it, and I found it to be, in spite of all those film school reviewers who think it is brilliant, one of the worst and most boring movies ever made."
4,My First Review,"I found this book to be a rather nice departure from the ""standard"" pipe tome. There was not the prerequisite history of tobacco and Sir Walter Raleigh's life story.Instead, there is an enjoyable, concise background section along with a chapter on ""how to smoke a pipe"" that was equally pointed and factual. The book seemed nicely non-biased and simply presented known facts about a given carver or company along with clear glossy photos (albiet of the most expensive examples) of that nameplate complete with price ranges.It is a quick read, but also a nice reference work that I have already found helpful as a quick ""go to guide."" It is a keeper in my small, but ever expanding library of pipe related printed media."
5,"Best source, so far!","I have a number of pipe books and this is by far the best I have read. It has info on how each company prepares the briar as well as how they make their pipes. If I were to have to keep but one pipe book, this is the one I would choose!"
3,"Good book, but little information","I red the 2000 edition. The book is somehow shallow. It's easy to read and provides some basic info, but that is too little too late for the average pipe aficionado in the internet era and also, doesn't explain the title.I would appreciate a more in depth view on the pipe makers, more photos of their most celebrated works. Their brand's mission doesn't stand for a philosophy, I would have expected to see more on their design than on their work procedures. Some great pipemakers are not included. A good example is Steven Downie, who's works deserve such a recognition. Anyway, maybe it was too early in the 2000 edition for that, maybe it happens in the later editions.The good point is that I've learnt more about the linkage between different pipemakers and pipe brands around the world, and also I've spoted 2 or 3 names I didn't knew about.Anyway this is a good book, even if it's not very close of being a connoisseur's guide."
5,Mejor que el primero...,"Dicen que las segundas partes no son buenas, pero en este caso es todo lo contrario. El disco está excelente. Tienen que comprarlo."
5,Dust Free Mess Free coffee grinding!,"My criteria was simple: I wanted a grinder that would hold 4-5 day's worth of whole beans, grind fine enough for my coffee maker, and NOT make a mess with grinds ending up all over the kitchen. I found it!"
1,Shake-Shake-Shake Shake your grinder,"I've been shaking this grinder more and more for years to keep the beans feeding, and it finally stopped grinding at all. Good riddance. Maybe the Maestro Plus is made better, but this model is about as convenient as a mortar and pestle."
2,ChefNemo,"Good starter grinder for those with a tight budget and a desire to move up from the standard Braun/Krups set. Problems:1. Oily beans will jam this puppy. Hard to keep clean.2. Very messy, as grinds seems to find my counter no matter how careful I am.3. Mine lasted an ""OK"" 2 years, then it fried when I ran it too long and it overheated.(...)"
1,Baratza G 285 Maestro Conical Burr Grinder,"Very disappointed w/ this grinder. It has a slow, annoyingly loud grinder. It may be our work location but the unit has a lot of static eletricity built up which leads to a messy counter top. The people in this office have gone back to using the cheap $10 grinder that they wanted to replace."
1,Two out-of-the-box-failures in a row!,"Reading reasonable reviews, I decided to take the plunge and bought a Baratza Maestro. The first grind of espresso beans went well and delivered promising results.The second grind was set coarser for a french press and, halfway through the grind, the drive shaft spun or gears stripped or the reduction cluster lunched. Anyway the thing packed up.The nice people at Baratza put one in shipment to replace and I sent the old one back. Hey, accidents happen, right?Repeat. Second grind, no fooling around, commercial beans and the transmission went ""blooey"".I shall wait to see what happens next.In the meantime, you might want to search out some alternatives."
3,Mediocre performance considering cost,"I just threw mine away. I got about 3 years of use out of it, but it has given me trouble with clogging and over heating for most of that time. I recently bought a dark oily bean that was the last straw on this camel's weak back. That killed it.So, I give it a mediocre rating. For the money, I simply think it should have performed better. It gives acceptable performance with coarse grind settings on medium roast beans. But fine grind on dark oily roast is a no go."
4,Went dead,"I hated to see this coffee grinder die. I have had four burr grinders and this one is the very best yet. Consistent grind, very quiet. The thing I hated most of my other grinders was the noise. The grind does not get as much static charge as other grinders. Unfortunately this grinder only lasted me four months and it died. I gave it four out of five stars only because of it's performance when it was working. This is an excellent grinder otherwise.Cons:-Does not have a timer and it will cost you fifty buck more to get one with.(recommend timer)-Grind container some what difficult to get in and out.-Hard to see if the grinder is full or ground coffee.-Will not auto shut off if full and will clog.-Mine didn't last long but maybe just the one I have."
3,The loudest appliance I have ever owned,"It is unbelievably loud! Purchased for work or I would have returned it. Grinds evenly and as expected, however the decibel level is crazy-loud."
1,I just tossed mine in the garbage.,"After a year of fighting with this thing, and having already brought it to the factory for service, I finally threw mine away. Beans would inexplicably stop feeding into the burrs, especially with French Roast beans, which are larger and lighter. When we did get some grinds out of it, the static electricity would send them shooting all over the place."
3,Fun & creative,"This book is a fun, silly and creative way to include some Hippie elements in to your daily life. Covering a large variety of activities from craft projects to how to flash a peace sign, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it as a lighthearted instruction manual for some vintage fun :) Flower power!"
5,Buy this book at once,"This is a wonderful book -- delightfully well crafted and inspiring. It has less to do with Robert Lowell than the title and other reviews imply, but so what. The rest of the author's family is just as interesting if not more so. She deals in a flinty steadfast New England way with madness and eccentiricity and writes with wit and charm, leaping effortlessly from Plymouth Rock to the 1980's. She has the very rare gift of being ironic and insightful about herself and her growing up without degenerating into self-pity. An example from 1967: ""Aunt Sarah talked of sending me to Miss Porter's [finishing school], just as she talked about the coming-out party she was going to given me in the garden in Manchester (but which I declined because of the bombing of Vietnam, a connection that was a bit clearer to me then)."" If you enjoy crystal clear prose, history and getting to know some delightful characters, this one's for you."
5,Abran paso a los Patitos (Make Way for Ducklings),"This is a classic written by Robert McClosky in the 1940's, but is timeless like all classics. The duck parents are flying over Boston looking for a place to hatch their eggs and raise their ducklings. This version is all in Spanish, but I found out after ordering this book that there is a bilingual version also. It is a really long book to begin with so it would be interesting to see the bilingual version."
4,This tale is about a mosquito who gets the jungle in a jam.,"This tiny mosquito scared everybody in the jungle because the animals have an alarm system. One animal runs one way and another the opposite way and this bird chirps and this rabbit hops and so on and so on. The animals do this to show that there is danger ahead. This works, but this time it was a false alarm. In all the commotion a baby owl falls out of a tree and dies. Now the owl will not make the sun come up."
1,Damaged,"I received the product and it was damaged, crused on top and right side during shipping. I contacted the sender to ask for the to replace the broken up portion, and never gotten a response. I didn't have time to return the because i sit them out ever year for my customers for the last six years, but I never had a problem until now. Most likely I will not order again from this vendor"
5,The Best,"Dana's latest cd Made of Mud is a great collection of songs. It is like all Dana Cooper works, a set of incredibly well craftedsongs. Dana is one of the very best songwriters, around. He has a wonderful voice and is a fanatastic guitarist, and a must see artist. I know this from experience."
4,Great book.,"You won't waste your money by buying this. I recently had the fortune to stumble upon this book; it's very interesting, and best of all, very good written. I enjoyed every part of it. This is the kind of book that keeps you thinking all night long. After reading Daniel's book, I acquired an interest in studying about this fascinating subject. Great job, Daniel."
3,Good Introduction to the MG Marque,"This text provides a good overview of the MG marque across several decades and offers the reader key points on each model. Because the scope is broad, there is not a lot of information on any one model. The system for rating the models is perhaps too simplistic but does provide a very basic foundation. The reader may be best served by accessing this book for general information and then pursuing other texts for detailed information on specific models. William Sydnor"
1,Cheap,"Cheaply made. The wires broke the very first time I used it. Be sure the butter is at room temp before cutting, or else the wires will break!"
5,Slice butter better than ever!,"There is nothing like this butter slicer. It is so convenient and the price is right, too!"
3,butter slicer,Not made as well as the one we replaced. The wire cutters are very weak feel like they might break.If we knew it was made like this we would not of ordered it.We. really would like to return it
5,Works well,"I had purchased a butter slicer years ago at Kroger and a wire recently broke on it -- could not find another anywhere except on Amazon, and this is just like the one I had."
5,Industrial Fan,"This cd stands out in my opinon as one of the better :Wumpscut: releases. Evoke is definatly slower paced then most of Rudy's work but this is the direction he's been heading in since EEvil Young Flesh. The female vocals, in my opinon just add to the ambience and sinster brooding of the songs. The album defiantly can hold it's weight on the dance floor as well as in your cd player. :Wumpscut: still remains one of the top dark industrial artists of our time"
2,What happened>???,"OKay, First off, i like everything :Wumpscut: has realeased, yes even Bone Peeler... Bone Peeler was unreal i thought... But this Evoke thing, i don't know... Some songs are really cool.. but he is hardly in the album. It is mostly these soul singing women throughout the whole thing. Kind of like a failing attempt to copy KMFDM. I don't know, if he makes another one i'll be there to buy it but as for the time being i am a little dissapointed with this one.. it's not the worst, just not the best..."
1,terrible,"every song is the same recipe, recycled over and over again, bone peeler was bad, but this album is terrible.....it wouldnt be so bad if wumpscut didnt have such an incredible begining."
4,BlondiEvoked,"Alright, an improvement over BonePeeler? Well im still quite undecided, but overall the album is quite good. My only problem with this album is that some of the songs are just TOO repetitive. I quite enjoyed the energy behind ""Churist Churist"", and thought that ""Maiden"", ""Tomb"", ""Evoke"" and ""Perdition"" were awesome tracks. On the otherhand ""Krolok"" is probably the weakest track on the album, requiring more substance, followed by ""Breathe"". The album art I thought was quite original and some of my favorite. A good package."
1,Cheaper than the price indicates,"I'm not much of an audiophile and needed cheap replacement speakers for my beater car to drown out the engine noises. I knew I was buying cheap and wasn't expecting much, but these are not worth the price paid. The connections are very weak, and non-standard size, so I had to splice on a standard size set onto the wires thinner than a politician's excuses. Oh well, at least they work."
5,Excellent backstory,"This is a really excellent book for Detroit Red Wings fans to read. I read this book a few months ago and I keep thinking about the stories I learned from it. It has a lot of backstory of how they added more players to this already amazing team, like how they signed Brett Hull, Luc Robitaille and Dominek Hasek. It demonstrates why fans love the Detroit Red Wings. It gave a lot of behind the scenes information that the average fan would not know. And there was a lot of information in the book that I don't remember reading in the newspaper when it happened. This book is essential for any Red Wings fan to own because it documents one of the best seasons the Wings ever had, going for their third cup in 6 years. I highly recommend it!"
2,Delayed Penalty,"This book could have been great - but it isn't. If you're wondering about the exact time shots occurred or goals were scored, buy this book. But if you're looking for a behind the scenes view of how this team worked together, DON'T buy this book. Cotsonika's writing style is like a book full of box scores. He mixes past, present and future events in the same paragraph - there's no flow to the story, no drama, no interesting facts. Cotsonika even throws in a couple of self-serving lockerroom moments that have no bearing on the story being told. I really looked forward to reading this book, and I forced myself to finish it, hoping it would eventually get better. My advice? Look in the Free Press archives for Mitch Albom articles about last year's run for the Cup."
5,Amazing...,"This is the notebook for people who love sony products. I just bought mine yesterday and all I can say is ""Wow!"". The memory stick slot for my digital camera and the iEEE port for my digital camcorder. How can you go wrong. If you like sony products and have them all, this is the notebook for you."
1,Order fulfillment at Sonystyle,"I would advise not to order GRX 500 series from Sonystyle's website.Oct 22: Order placedOct 29: Order status not shown up on online order tracking.Waited 30 min on customer hotline and was told order was in process and informationw would be available 7 days from order date.Nov 3: E-mailed about status and was told order was built to order and in process of building.Nov 5: Further enquiry about the same simple question: What is Order Status? Issue unresolved.Nov 7: Same question. Possible Cancellation of order and was told to call customer hotline again. Issue unresolved.Nov 8: Told me I would have received an e-mail. But, I never did. Will I ever receive a confirmation of cancellation of order? I don't want to be billed for it later on and want to place an order somewhere else."
2,Sony support awful,"Since I bought this notebook I am in trouble. The computer is slow and two months later the LCD screen did not worked. I claim for repair under warranty to Sony and I had to ship the computer to San Diego,California paying all shipment expenses. They knew what the problem with the LCD was before they received and now they do not want to repair it under the warranty. What kind of computer is this, that I bought it in September as a new model and now is discontinued."
2,"Runs very hot, poor battery life,","This laptop runs very hot, I'm afraid the casewill melt. Speed is ok, comparable to an 1.2Ghz Athlon XP.Battery life is below 2 hours.Get the Sony VAIO FXA53 Notebook (1.3 GHz Athlon XP1500+, 256 MB SDRAM, 30 ,longer batter life! Runs much cooler and you will not be sorry!"
1,BAD EXPERIENCE,I RECEIVED A USED AND BROKEN ITEM.I HAD TO FIX IT MY SELF. SOME INTERNAL PARTS IN THE ROTOR WERE LOOSE. AND TWO SCREW HOLES WERE BROKEN.IT WAS MY IMPRESSION THAT I WAS BUYING A NEW ITEM!!!VERY DISAPOINTING...
2,5 gal 2.0 HP Shopvac,"Also called the quiet model. And it is much quieter than the 5 gal 1.5 HP Shopvac that I also have. And I enjoy the quieter model except for one thing. It chokes on anything larger than a dime. True. Using it in my wood shop it does sawdust just fine. But ingest a chip of wood larger than a dime and never mind. Clean out the hose. Now the loud 1.5 HP Shopvac has much more suction and hardly ever chokes. If it can get it in the tube it swallows it whole. I now use the older, louder model in the shop."
3,light and very portable,"We volunteer at an animal sanctuary and these vacs used there get a lot of tough use. Nothing fancy about these machines, but they last as well as could be expected and are light and very portable. The cloth filter is a cost saver and is easy to clean. Do wish they had fixtures on board to wrap the cord around."
1,It sucks!,"If you want to have a vacuum that tips over easily and blows dirt out between canister and top, this is the one for you. Yes it vacuums but the annoying habit of falling over makes me give it a one star and if I could, it would be lower. It is top heavy and round so that contributes to its unstable nature. Don't buy it."
4,Shop Vac 5 Gallon,"Great Product. It has great quality but was priced a little high, compared to other market prices. Still a great product though. Am very happy with purchase."
4,Shop-Vac 5840500 5 gallon 2 H Wet dry vac,Shop-Vac 5840500 5 gallon 2 H Wet dry vac. I have only used it once but it seems to be powerful for what I need it for. A little bulky in size.
5,INFORMATIVE,"I always enjoy listening to Dr. Kabat-Zinn. This CD presents a a very good reason to try mindful meditation. Kabat-Zinn has a very pleasing voice with easy concepts to relate to. If you are looking for actual meditations this is not the CD for you, but he definitely gives you a good place to start the practice of meditation with the breath. Highly recommend."
5,Mindfulness Meditation,"I am new to meditation, but I found this to be very helpful. His voice is very soothing and the information very helpful. I loved it!"
3,not what i expected,"the guided meditations were good, but there was too much narrative on the 1st cd,luckily there was less on the 2nd cd. it was having his book read to me... too much info about his hospital work with patients.there was no play list included to make finding the parts i like easier."
2,Mindful Meditation,"I thought I chose one cd titled Mindful Meditation. When I emailed to make sure it would be delivered within 3 days, I learned that I had actually ordered 17 tapes and that they were packaged and ready to go, so I agreed to the tapes. I received the order on time,it was more material than I needed, for $17.99. I would have preferred to have the choice of ordering one tape for less money."
3,It's Good To Play When Relaxing,"When i first heard the Skatalites I really enjoyed sitting back and listening to them. So I thought I would buy their Best songs. It's a good CD, pretty much has the same tempo throughout it."
5,Nice heavy weight mini muffin pan!,"We used ours for the first time tonight to make Fine Cooking's ""Bacon, Leek & Cheddar Mini Quiches"". These turned out very well. We used a light shot of cooking spray and every mini-quiche easily and cleanly released from the pan. The surface of the Wilton Avanti series pans seems quite slick. Hope it stays that way. So far - so good!"
4,It looks great,Haven't used it yet....but it looks exactly as I pictured and looks like it will be perfect for making mini muffins and cupcakes
3,Broken Coupler,"The gun looks to be constructed OK for the price and it loaded easily. However, the coupler on mine came broken. I have contacted the manufacturer through their website to see if I can get a replacement. If they send me one without a hassle, I'm assuming this will work OK. I'll just have to wait and see."
3,"Seaman's Friend, hard core reading","Richard Dana's ""Two Years Before the Mast"" is my favorite book, and I have often chosen books to read about sailing in the 1800s. So when I saw I could get another book by Dana I jumped at it. However, since my sailing has been mostly fresh water lake and a little SF Bay day sailing, the minutia of the different parts of a big tall ship was too much for me.This book is better suited to someone who actually sails on tall ships, or who is a serious naval history buff. (I thought I was, but this was too much arcane detail for me.)My fault...just what did I expect!"
1,Interesting but not the best,"An interesting book, but there are definitely better ones to learn how age of the sail ships were manoeuvered.To get a vivid account of how all these tasks were done during a round-cape-Horn cruise, you'd better read ""Two years before the mast"" of the same author."
2,"Track 7...oh god, track 7...","Track 7 is what drunk Dwarves probably sing. No wonder Dwarves are so dour. One does not listen to this album, one subjects themselves to it. This sounds like it is Eastern Euorpean folk music being sung by the original artists. Some of the tracks aren't so bad, but others make up for it. Especially track 7."
3,Pretty Good,"I think what makes this film so ""scary"" is the fact that it's a kid. If you really think about it, LOTS of horror films where the kid is the villian are often scarier than movies where the villian is an adult."
3,pretty good,"this movie reminded me of ""mikey"" a whole lot.this one was alright.definetely rent it before you buy it.i was about to turn it off when i got it.i watched about ten minutes and it looked way too weird.but i decided not to turn it off and see what the rest of the movie was like.of course this movie probably wont get any stars or awards or anything but this one is a good one to watch with friends.milo's voice creeped me out.plenty of chills in this one."
1,"Milo, A Great Movie (Ya Right)","This is one of worst films I've ever seen. It's plot is stupid, it is very pretictable, the acting sucks, and the ending is the worst ending for a movie I've seen in years. If this movie was on sale for 5 cents, and it was the only movie in the store, and I would get locked upside down in a locker for a day if I didn't buy it, I still wouldn't buy it. This movie isn't even good enough to rent, even for free. Spend your money on something else, don't go near this movie. Please, please don't tell me they'll make a sequel, that will make this movie look even worse, cause I doubt they could make a sequel that was better than this horrible movie. Please listen to my review, only rent this if your life was in the fate of this movie. Anyway, that's all I got to say, DON'T GO ANYWHERE NEAR THIS MOVIE.1/10Rated R for violence and mild language."
4,3.5 Stars,"Not bad, but not great, it is just good. I like it. It was scary and creepy, with great music and exceptional acting, and haveing the kid as the killer is a twist. Rent before buying, and watch this one alone in the dark."
1,Movie is a sleeper that never woke up.,"O.k., I'm going to attempt to review this ""cinematic beauty"" in the same vein I viewed it. Here goes. I think ... ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (cough, cough) ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ...."
3,"Not bad,better than most slashers.","i read bad reviews for this movie,but i saw it anyway cause i usually like schlok horror.this was better than most deranged-stalker-killing-teens movies,though it got kinda dumb at the end.I just wished the whole deal with Milo was explained better.Is he a ghost? Zombie? Vampire? it also needed more death scenes to make it more memorable.I suggest you rent it first,then buy it if you want it in your home."
1,Milo,"Milo is the dumbest movie ever. No horor lover would love that movie. The boy is wierd and strange but not scary. I would only buy this to start a collection of not scary, scary movies. save your money and buy Darkness Falls. Thats a scary movie."
1,1 Pair of Leather Assless Chaps to Trade for Spiderman Comic,"I would compare this movie with that of the ""lord of the rings"" trilogy, anything with frank sinatra in it, the annual pedigree dog competition, ""the price is right"" show, and Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition.In a nutshell, this movie rocks my mom, and my sister, who are the same persaon, if you catch my drift.by the way, i know where you live"
5,Pretty Good,"This movie is sick! An aborted baby killing people! It's pretty scary! This is a great low-budget film. Better than most of the modern horror out right now. rent this first, then buy it. See it. This is like th exorcist compared to scream!"
1,What a steaming pile of monkey crap.....,"With all the good horror movies that have been done, you'd think by now people wouldn't make movies like this. Milo is uninteresting, hokey, and down-right boring. The only scary thing about this movie is that someone actually gave people money to make it. Since 1 star is the lowest I can give, the producers of Milo owe me a star."
3,Milo,"For the length of time i searched for this movie, this movie should of been better. Well its not a total lost, i own it in my collection of lame horror movies."
5,A Most Excellent Illustrated Guide !,"This book is the very best guide to the instruments of the world I have ever seen. I bought it back in the 80's when it was first published, and I still use it today when I need to see what a Kalimba from the Sudan might look like (or other such unusual specific). The Diagram Group is the fantastic assemblage of artists that illustrated and produced this most handsome volume. Each page is a masterpiece of design and ""infographics"" and, although printed in two-color only, shines with a level of detail and expertise you will not find elsewhere.I can't say enough about how good this book is. If you have any reason to enjoy the vast number of musical instruments mankind has created, and if you want to know the hows, whys and wheres about musical instruments, then get this book! I think it's so good that I'm ordering a new one to replace my dog-eared copy."
4,Heartfelt,"Every person can identify with some feeling, some remark in this collection. The poem ""The Circle Game"" itself is heavy with emotion, and it makes the reader feel. This is one of my favorite collections from Atwood."
5,Excellent product,"Great product. Price is the same as the store price, but generally, the stores don't have the selection. Buy online."
4,Grandson loved this,This game was bought for my grandson. He loved it. The look on his face when he recieved this as a gift was priceless.
5,Family Fun,"We really liked this dvd. It is divided between the puppets, live action footage and singing characters. It is a lot to pack into only 20 minutes and therefore it kept the attention of my 3 year old daughter. Her favorite part was when Mr. Jibblets was in the garden and was soaked by the sprinklers! A great homemade product that has kept us coming back to it again and again."
5,Wonderful video for children of all ages!,Mr. Jibblets was totally hilarious! I have a 7 yr. old and a 4 yr. old and they both loved it! We can't wait to see Mr. Lucarelli's next video!
2,Price gouging?,"This item sold on Amazon and at HD and Lowes for less than $150 in late 2010. Now it is listed here on Amazon at $350 - and it is sold by Amazon, not a third party vendor. I am surprised that Amazon is 'scalping' its customers on this item."
5,Great tool!,"I have this jigsaw. While it is a fine looking tool, in action it is the best! I was required to make a modification of the plexi light columns in the Neiman-Marcus Christmas window display, cutting MDF, plexi, steel and other materials, the saw was a wonder. I got mine!"
4,Great tool,"I purchased this jigsaw about a year ago to make a large project from 3/4"" plywood. I was easily able to make any cut I needed. It performs very well with Bosch blades that are appropriate to the material. I would definitely recommend this tool to anybody."
2,Lacking in safety,I bought the Bosch 1591EVSK barrel grip a couple weeks ago based off of the positive reviews and Bosch's reputation.First let me say that it is a very solid jigsaw. Plenty of power and the barrel grip gives you extra control. My major complaint is safety. There is an on/off switch on the side of the barrel. Bosch should have used a safety switch similar to what Milwaukee's angle grinders use. If the saw ever got out of your hands it would continue to run. Another point that I do not like is the speed adjustment is located on the end of the barrel making it difficult to adjust the speed while operating the saw.
1,heats up,"Sawing for a short period of time is very acceptable but with prolonged use (over an half hour) the motor heats up so hot that you can barely hold onto the saw. A cool down period of up to 20 min is adequate for another 10 or minutes use, then the heating up begins again. Never had this trouble with any other jig saw but might have to do with the fact that you are holding this saw by the motor, not some accessory handle. Like the blade changing, best I have used but the heat is not acceptable."
5,The Real Deal!!!,"When you are finished playing with toy jigsaws, buy one of these and do some real work. This is probably the best power tool I have ever used (and I have used a lot)! Superb ergonomics, lots of power, smooth, accurate, easy to use, great features. The blade change feature alone is worth the extra money. This is one fantastic saw! Like my Father used to tell me; ""Always buy the best, you will never be dissapointed."""
5,Surprised how good it is...,"I needed more horsepower in a jigsaw than the small Makita I have had for years. I was really questioning the barrel grip, but because of the good ratings, I ordered this one over the the one with the standard handle. When it came out of the box, it felt too heavy/ackward in my hand, and I was afraid I had made a mistake. But as soon as I tried it out, I was extremely impressed. It felt good in my hand (I have small hands). The control was excellent, and I like the blower that blows the dust out of the way, although you may want to sometimes wear goggles. The quality of control and cut is excellent. I know it is a lot of $$, but if you do much jig sawing or need high quality cuts, it is worth it."
