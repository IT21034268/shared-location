1,Terrible,"I started reading the Replica series in seventh grade, and I have now finished Amy, on Her Own, presumably the last book in the series. I can honestly say that this book is HORRIBLE, TERRIBLE and is quite possibly the worst thing I've ever read in my life. Amy can FLY? How lame is that? Kaye's books were very good and interesting for maybe the first 10, 15 or so. But when the Plague trilogy started, you could tell she was only doing this to get money. How ridiculous was that trilogy? Back to the last book, I can't get over how awful it was! If you haven't read it yet, don't read it at all, it's a complete waste of money and time. I picked 1 star because that's the lowest possible rating. If it were an option, I would have given it negative stars."
1,"Amy, On Her Own","This book is very unrealistic. I did not like it at all. It was a horrible way to end a fairly good series. The main character, Amy, is faced with yet another life shattering problem. The loss of the extraordinary genetic ablilities that she was blessed with. She and her genetic mate (Andy) must find out why this is happening. When everything turns out to be fine, all of the Project Crescent clone are happy. That is, except Amy. She feels like she has turned into a new person. She decides to get her powers back. The procedure that allows her to do so also enhances other qualities that she did not have before. She turns into a super-hero (she can fly and everything). None of the other clones get the procedure, making her the only clone let with super ablilties."
1,What an unbelieveable ending to a great series.,"As you can see from all the other books this book was the WORST EVER! I could have written a better book and I'm only 11! All the other reviewers are right. The plots HAVE gotten worse since the triolgy. I don't want to let out my anger but *sigh* I'm very sad to let you know, you person sitting at your computer, to say Goodbye to replica.Even if you got the book already you might as well read it*phmp* *stupid book*P.S. Thanks Marilyn. You said ( in like father like son ) that you wouldnt let the reader of replica. Well, obviously ya did."
2,a star just because of the other books,"i would have really given this book one star, but since i loved all the other books i gave it an extra. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK IN THE WHOLE SERIES!!! i mean, why would amy want to be the only clone left? it doesn't seem right. you need all the clones! and no guys she ends up with. the whole moving to malibu when nancy and dave got married was totally dumb. i was sad when they got together. and amy saving teh world? this isn't superman. i think if marilyn kaye made the right decision of making this the last book, because if all the future ones are like this...that would be very sad."
2,Disappointing,"I have read the entire Replica series, and was excited and sad to find out that this book was the last of the series. The book was good, until the end when I was dissappointed at the unrealistic nature of the conclusion. However, this does not change my opinion that the rest of the series is very much worth reading!"
1,Crash and Burn,"After reading this book, I immediately told my mom not to read beyond book two. I was twelve when I started reading and am now fifteen...Marilyn Kaye's ending was atrocious. The entire, miraculous three pages she spent to end the tale probably took about twenty seconds. Characters who didn't even BELONG in these books (including Adrian Peele), somehow managed just for the sake of wrapping the book up as quickly as possible. If you're currently reading the series, my advice is to stop now before you get disappointed."
3,"Hats-great, Crash-gongy","I bought these for my son, the hi hats sound great, open and crisp. The 18 inch ""CRASH"" is rather dark and dull lots of sustain. I had bought the 16 inch crash of the same series and it sounds fantastic."
3,Like Yes Without Jon Anderson,"With all the talent assembled for this project, it's a wonder they didn't come up with something better. The opening melody is a snooze, and ""In Held 'Twas I,"" while chock-full of interesting moments, isn't nearly as fascinating if you already knew the original. ""Mystery Train"" is the standout on this CD, but if you're looking for something a little meatier from these four fine musicians, try ""Bridge Across Forever."""
2,what was that all about?,"amazing musicians. portnoy is one of the better tub thumpers in recent times. and what more can one say about neal morse than what has been said?still, do we need this? these guys are like 4 rip van winkles who fell asleep when tales of the topographic ocean was cut, and woke up just about yesterday. dont they know this kind of overblown excess was rejected a few decades ago... and rightly too? you can write a 40 minute song if you are ian anderson writing thick as a brick. he could write.it seems like transatlantic have something to say, but they dont say it very well.so they spice it up with a lot of virtuoso curry. it might have worked as 5 or 6 songs instead of one 30 minute high decibel snooze.dont get me wrong. i am a prog fan. but 30 years is a long time for musicians not to have learned a few lessons."
2,Neither fish nor fowl.,"On the one hand, this CD mostly lacks the stupfiying musicianship of Dream Theater (ok, it has those annoying bass drum rolls) and OTOH, it lacks the gorgeous melodies of Spock's Beard. So, yes, the tunes are long and complex but not all that great to listen to. The one glorious exception is We All Need Some Light which comes darned close to to classic Genesis (""Entangled""). Given the skill of the players it makes you realize how difficult it is to replicate the lushness of the classic Genesis/King Crimson/Mellotron sound."
2,Too Much Noodling,"First: I am a huge fan of Spock's Beard and to a lesser extent progressive music in general. One of the reasons I like the band and many of Morse's projects is because it is just plain good music. I am not one of those prog-rock guys that listens to nothing but odd-time-20-miunte-jam-fairies-on-the-mountain tunes. If you are one of those guys (and you know who you are) you will dig this album. For me, it was a few interesting ideas and textures, but the majority of the music didn't really seem to go anywhere. No question about the talent involved, but it just seemed that in terms of the songs, production, etc. it is a poor substitute for Spock's Beard."
5,Prog rock masterpiece,"The accolades are all true - this is one of the best prog rock albums of the last 30 years. Of particular note are the epic ""All of the Above"", and the much shorter but extremely substantial ""My New World"", which is a clinic in great prog-rock composition and performance. It's wonderful to hear these musicians outside the context of their regular bands (Portnoy especially stands out - you never might have known his capacity for stylish restraint hearing him with Dream Theater). The other Transatlantic album is equally as wonderful, and it's a darned shame that these two albums will apparently be the only two from this super-group. One can only hope that Neal comes back to his senses and puts this group together for another run, but in the meantime, this superb artistic effort is good for hundreds if not thousands of listenings. Highly recommended."
2,"""Progressive"", not progressive","This is a studious tribute to the classic Prog Rock sound of Genesis, Yes, and ELP of course. But what this CD lacks is the magic that made these older bands shine.Yes and Genesis did what they did and the public called it Progressive. They were simply being progressive (lowercase p). SMPTe sounds like these bands. They set out to make Prog Rock. But it is not progressive. They lack the visionary and charismatic leadership that Peter Gabriel, Jon Anderson, and Fish brought to their bands. The singer (Neal Morse) has a nice voice. His voice and compositions remind me of the great power pop of Jellyfish (""The King is Half-Undressed). No magic, just exceptional musicianship.I do enjoy listening to this CD. It does not suck but it's not much more than what's on the surface."
3,Its Good,"Its Good but if you really want to be impressed, get Images and Words (Dream Theater), The Thieving Magpie (Marillion), Space Revolver (Flower Kings), V (Spock's Beard). These guys have tremendous talent but I don't think they have even come close to what they have done on the aforementioned albums. They need to work longer together to reach their true potential as Transatlantic. I think they can do it!"
3,"Some may love this cd, some may only like it.","The reason I have chosen to write this review is due to particular magazines, like Classic Rock, giving this cd 5/5 stars, which is something they rarely do and may convince the reader this cd is the greatest thing since sliced bread.If you like Spock's Beard ""Day for Light"" cd and are totally enamoured with the Flower Kings's sound; then you will consider this cd worthy of 5/5 stars.However, if you prefer the less popier sound of previous Spock's Beard cds and think the Flower Kings are a good but not excellent band; then you may not agree with the afore-mentioned glowing reviews this cd has received.Since I am in the latter, it rates only a 3 or 7/10 in my book.The only other thing I can add is the terrific bass playing on this cd, which any bass player would be advised to pick up this cd.Hopefully I will have helped someone with this review in their decision to purchase this cd."
2,Meh - I just can't get into this,"I like DT and Spock's Beard, but I don't understand the love for this. Mystery Train is not bad but the rest of the songs are just noodly and boring.... as another reviewer wrote, you'll find yourself checking your watch.I've also discovered King Crimson recently... now THAT is amazing. My advice is to go listen to them instead."
4,Not bad but not great either.,Instead I would recommend Raingods with Zippos by Fish and marillion.com by Marillion. Its a fair effort though and if you have the other two get it and enjoy.
4,Import version of the album,"SMPT:e was released both in Europe and America (in both regular and limited editions). This is the import regular edition, containing the same music as the domestic release - the only important difference is the cover art.Considering this import is even more expensive than the domestic limited edition, it is advisable to ignore this item and prefer either of the domestic releases."
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I love prog- its my fav genre- but i bought this CD- and now its a coaster for my cats fnacy feast! The long ""epic"" songs just dont work- i mean cmon- 30 mins? no way."
2,SuperFan gave me this ....this gives prog a bad name,Neoprog Ran's Math Lesson for the day:Stolt + Morse + Portnoy + Trawawawawaws = overblown squared excess galore = a difficult listen to these ears
5,sMpte,"For progressive rock fans, there's a lot to like here. I won't go track-by-track because it is so consistent, plus the first track accounts for about half the (jam-packed) cd. Solid musicianship, outstanding songwriting, very dynamic in its highs, lows, mellow and blistering rock.If I had one wish, with this and the other Transatlantic cd, it would be that Neal Morse, whom I adore, would step back a little and let it be more of a collaboration. His style is stamped all over these songs, his is the voice for the majority of the lyrics, and in a lot of ways this could easily be mistaken for another Spock's Beard release. No, that's not a bad thing, but this was a chance for something more different.You can tell by the stars that I'm not letting that diminish the enjoyment. All you fans of classic Genesis, Yes, and ELP can buy with confidence if you haven't already."
4,Greatly done,"This ""supergroup"" is made from member of Spock's Beard, The Flower Kings, Marillion and Dream Theatre. It is clear for me that this album is a great one and that the orientation of the sound and composition is more of Spock's Beard than any of the other. The three more long and complex songs ""All of the above"", My new world"" and ""In held"" are top class composition. The other two act more like some filler to complete the album. Overall, greatly recommanded for any prog fan."
4,"IF YOU LIKE PROG. ROCK, BUT THIS","Incredible. These are the only words to describe ""All Of The Above"", the 30 minute plus epic that kicks off the cd. Too often, we hear 20+ minute songs that drag at times, sound stitched together or simply sound long for the sake of being long. None of these describe this song. I am not going to describe the song because you have to hear it to believe it. Track 2 is a nice little song that fits well in the middle of all the madness. I, personally, don't like ""Mystery Train"" at all, but sometimes songs just don't hit you right. ""My New World"" is an outstanding song with many tempo changes and the last song is very unusual, but is very good at times, though for a 17+ minute song, the ending could have been better, but oh well. I bought this because I am a huge Dream Theater fan and this sounds nothing like them, so when you buy it, all I have to say is prepare yourself for a helluva ride."
5,Supergroup indeed!,"Remember when ASIA was a big deal? The first real prog rock supergroup with Steve Howe (Yes), Carl Palmer (ELP), Geoff Downes (Yes, Buggles) and John Wetton (King Crimson, UK). Well we have another one here! Here we have a true SUPER group with Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), Neal Morse (Spock's Beard), Pete Trewavas (Marillion) and Roine Stolt (Flower Kings). All of these guys still kept their day jobs but this is no back seat side gig! What an amazing work! The limited edition is worth it with the demos and alternate takes! BUY THIS!"
3,Promising yet Mediocre,"Englander needs to find his own voice. You can tell he's the product of those countless writer workshops in IOWA because he writes the way all of them write - like Raymond Carver. Of course, ENGLANDER has carved himself a nice little niche by writing about Orthodox Jews instead of the typical middle class malaise. He shows promise but he needs to find his own voice."
5,run n' buy it!!!,an amazing new book from a new writer who has done an amazing job in bringing these people to life and making us get the chills while reading the stories.
2,Didn't meet expectations,"I had eagerly awaited reading this book but found it neither as bad as some reviewers have stated nor as perfect as others. The stories are thought-provoking, interesting and have nice touches. But the endings always left me disappointed. Other than a chance to learn about a different culture I probably wouldn't recommend the book to a friend."
4,The short story is back,"This is a collection of well written poignant short stories with Jewish themes and sometimes unexpected twists. There is subdued humor in the midst of darkness, and well developed characters that combine to create a well crafted and thought provoking read."
3,High expectations not fully met,"I approached this collection of short stories with very high expectations. These expectations were set by the reviews here and in other media. Based on these reviews I expected this book to be a rich and rewarding experience. I found, however, that the stories conveyed a certain hollowness of tone and singularity of viewpoint that was distracting and ultimately not fully satisfying. There is no doubt in my mind that the author can produce beautiful prose and has important ideas to convey, but I think his true promise lies in his future work. I recommend the book, but feel it might be over-praised."
2,Derivative; not a new voice,I don't think the problem is so much that the author portrays things in terms of Jewish cliches or jokes; even Jews talk about their own lives in terms of these tropes. More problematic is that someone is our age is writing like Bernard Malamud or Isaac Bashevis Singer.
1,Yet another Blood Libel!,"An angry young man who finds libeling Orthodox Jews the best way to vent his personal frustrations, this author like so many others, misses the main point. A overwhelming majority of Orthodox and Ultra-Orthodox Jews are extremely happy with their situations and live very satisfied meaningful lives. Let the author or some of some of his fans come spend a Shabbos in a Chassidic Community such as Boro Park, and will find out that fact is very different than fiction."
4,Just another opinion,"Nathan Englander's ""For the Relief of Unbearable Urges"" contained some of the better short stories I have ever read. One story in particular stands out in my mind: ""The Gilgul of Park Avenue."" This is the story of a man who suddenly finds religion and how he and his family handle the sudden changes. It is almost comical to watch the main character try to learn more about the religion he now finds himself immersed in, while attempting to maintain harmony with his wife, shrink, rabbi, and himself. The story was both funny and thought provoking and I highly recommend it."
4,Hilarious and sad,"I have to admit: I was prejudiced. O no, not another book on Jewish culture. O no, not short stories.Yes, it is a book on Jewish culture and yes, it is a book with short stories. But the main thing is: it is extremely well written, it is at times funny (the Protestant guy who suddenly knows for certain that he is Jewish, the orthodox man who for once is allowed to visit a prostitute and ends up with a venereal disease) and at times deeply sad (the group of Polish Jews who accidently escape transport to the concentration camp and have to survive by pretending they are the acrobats they are not, the ""accidental writer"" murdered by Stalin).Every story in the book is a little gem, every story forces you to think. I look forward to Nathan Englander's next book."
2,Wildly Over Rated,"This was another book I was given by a friend who said ""you gotta read it!"" Well, read it I did and I am wondering what all the hype (my friend and the media frenzy) is about. These are pre-digested, tightly edited stories that are so seriously derivative of Isaac Bashevis Singer that it's outrageous! I can only imagine that the reviewers haven't ever read Singer's work.It seems that the appeal here is that they deliver an easily comprehended story. Listen, if you are interested in this kind of writing, read Singer, read Cynthia Ozick, read Saul Bellow and read the real thing, not a clever re-working of earlier, better writing."
5,Short Stories,"I never read short stories, but picked up this book because of the intriguing title. This collection is brilliant, a must read."
1,Just returned this book.,"I read so many positive reviews and profiles of this book that I did something I don't usually do: I bought the book without reading some of it. I agree with the people who've said this work is derivative. I love Bernard Malamud, Isaac Singer, Isaac Babel's work. I find their work joyous and exquisitely written. These stories are pale imitations. I have never before returned a book. I love books, I love to lend them and re-read them even if I don't always agree with them or love them. But this one seemed like fast-food to me. At first you think it's real but then you begin to chew and it's cardboard. Whatever happend to Mel Gussow? He used to be so on-target in his writing. I would never lend this to anyone. Don't waste your time!"
1,overhyped,"if you want to read great short stories without the hype and hyperbole read Ken Kalfus' ""Thirst"" and Andy Plattner's ""Winter Money."" Two great collections that come with minimal endorsements and maximum pleasure."
5,"Excellent, irreverent and touching look at Jewish Life","Loved it and have recommended all of my friends to make Englander their new hero. He is Phillip Roth without the angst, Elie Wiesel without the grief, Alan Dershowitz without the whining, Shalom Aleichem without the earlocks, and God without the ""Holier than thou"" attitude."
3,Spotty,"I couldn't agree more with those that say there are a couple of gems and the rest can be lived without. There is much promise here, but the reviews claiming Mr. Englander to be the second coming of Singer or more are premature at best."
4,The Opening Story is STUNNING,"The opening story was startling--I've never read anything like it. It wasn't the tone or the voice that startled--they were familiar in the way that Malamud sounds familiar, in the way that a distant relative you've seen only once before sounds familiar when he tells you a story about your father as a kid in New Jersey. But what happened in the story--the actual story, was so clever and sad and original, that it was hard to turn away.There are many stories like this in the collection. The story about the wig . . . ah, well, I shouldn't say more. And then there are a couple of stories that couldn't hold me in the same way--I skimmed through them and moved on to the great ones. As a whole, a truly remarkable collection."
3,Great writing style - unnecessarily cynical though.,"OK, Nathan Englander can write and he knows about our orthodox world from the inside. But Nathan, find the good in things, in people, in situations. Where is the love? I am reminded of the saying that ""Any rav (rabbi) can declare a chicken tref (unkosher), but it takes a talmid chochom (very learned one) to declare one kosher."" By comparison, Isaac Singer does manage to find the inner beauty of his characters. Tevya of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" has a beautiful soul, which is shared with the reader. So could have Nathan's wigmaker, writer, and frustrated husband characters, but this component is missing. Perhaps this will come as Nathan Englander matures. Nevertheless, buy and enjoy his books now, but know that this is not the deepest reality. I'm can't wait to read more of Nathan Englander when he shares awe, ecstasy, purity, kindness and the positive depth of humanity."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!!,"DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!!! Nice plane for a beginner, but it comes with a defective tail boom. Dragonfly produced a batch of defective airplanes and this seller is selling them. Buyer's BEWARE!"
4,Good for beginners,"This plane was super easy to assemble (about 20 minutes) and with help, I was flying right away. I would recommend getting an extra battery though so that you can fly longer. We were the hit at the park that day."
1,do not buy from this seller.,"received defective product after waitting 10 days. called seller and they said they would send repair parts and i could repair. not an easy job and local hobby shop said it was a tech. problem to repair. seller said to return product and they would repair it after they receiced it. 10 days return and another 10 days return. 30 days total. actually they would do repair and return. i bought a new product , not a remanfactured one. i agreed to get new parts and attempt a repair . i tried to repair myself and trying to break glue loose it cracked . threw away the product.$120.00 out the door.i learned a lesson. don't buy from this seller."
1,Disappointment,"Very disappointed in this CD. 4 new songs, and 2 live songs (one from their last CD - not even one of the better songs, and the title track from this CD). Nothing to write home about."
4,Not Original Recordings...,I'm 99% sure these are re-recordings of the classics.Don't have the same feel.
2,Wasn't crazy about it,"I got this season because when it first came on TV I caught it in the middle and wanted to see it from the beginning. Minus one couple, this season was really boring compared to the other seasons. Didn't like it."
1,Not what it should be,"This show is advertised as if you will see brides gone wild. You will see brides become extremely rude and aggressive. You will see brides bringing people to tears. You will see brides fighting with florists and cake makers and venues. You will see brides fight and insult family members and friends to the point of tears.NOT!The show plays it up that you will see brides becaome uncontrolable. But. There are very few arguments, insults, or anything at all happening that would even closely resemble the bridezilla monster this show is supposed to be about.Hardly any of the brides get too upset, or when they do, it's very controlled and mature.Another fault of the show is that too many couples are introduced and their stories dragged out for too many episodes. You get confused as to who is who.Honestly, this show is NOT what they advertise it to be."
5,Not a bathroom read!,"I stumbled on this book in a second hand store and so enjoyed it; glad it is listed so cheaply here so my friends can have it as a gift! Like many others, I'm looking for a copy of the TBS 10 hour (Fall of 1990) series in which the two primary characters are played by William Shatner and Faye Dunaway..."
4,it is excellent,"Kachche Daage is not a great film, but it's highly watchable with some really fun moments.The songs are also excellent with the action is also good this movie also did good at the cinemas.people if you need to watch a movie on a Friday or Saturday this is what you need i was shocked at the very ending when ???????? turns out to be the villain and the action at the ending is A1.The songs like 'pyar Nanni kare'is the best.Don't forget this movie is a must see for all Ajay Devgan and Saif Ali Khan fans"
1,Exemplifies disrespectful children,"The story has a rythm of Mamma calling the duckling ""Quack, Catch up!"" and the duckling responds ""No! I won't catch up!"". Five or six times this happens! SERIOUSLY!??? Is this the behavior you want your children to emulate????? I knew I didn't like it, but when I heard my 4 year old respond ""No! I won't ___"" to what I had just asked her to do, that was the tipping point and this book went in the recycling bin--not even donated, so as not to add to the generation of children already disrespectful to their parents/teachers. Perhaps if there had been some negative cosequence--such as the duckling had actually appeared FRIGHTENED when the alligator appeared--the story would have redeeming value. As it is, I highly recommend NOT purchasing this book--or even checking it out from a library."
4,Great Book for Beginners,"Easy to read. Interesting information about the philosophy and history of Jujitsu. Pictures are hugely helpful, provide step by step instruction by someone qualified to teach it."
2,"Jujitsu: Basic Techniques of the Gentle Art (Japanese Arts, 425)",This book is not for the beginner. It shows a lot of different techniques but doesn't really show the basics.
5,EVERY MARTIAL ARTIST MUST GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jujitsu is a parent art. That means a lot of popular martial arts like karate, judo, etc. can be traced back in history as jujitsu techniques. That makes jujitsu the ultimate martial art.This book is very EXCELLENT!!! This book only teaches the basic and simple moves that can be mastered easily by anyone who wants to defend themselves against a violent attacker.EVERYONE MUST GET THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A basic book lacking actual basics,"I recently purchased this book, along with the intermediate and advanced books from this series, and I was disappointed. The book professed to be a book on basics but it is missing all of the basics. The only truly basic technique it has is break falls. It moves from break falls directly into hip throws without explaining the idea of unbalancing, center line, or even what a throw actually consists of. It would work as a reminder for someone taking a class, but it does not work for a true beginner. The book seems to skip past the first two to three months of training. Other than that the pictures were good and I was impressed by the grading criteria in the back."
5,Lovely Pringle-Style Chips,"Unlike many Haba play foods, these little chips are scaled in a size relative to other wooden play foods. In the style of a pringle sort of chip, they stack into the (absolutely adorable) tin, which actually accomodates quite a few of them. They are, of course, quite thick relative to their width, which is to be expected since they would otherwise splinter apart and be a total danger. Their quantity could easily serve 2-4 tea party guests. And, like all other Haba toys, they have that trademark perfect smooth satin finish.All in all, I'm very pleased with them, but would advise that they could definitely still pose a choking risk, as they are quite small."
4,Very small potato chips,"I expected the tin to be small.....I didn't expect it to be this small! The tin is about 3"" tall, 1""d. I'd say there's about 20 chips in each tin. I purchased two tins for my girls to add to their play food collection, but I decided to put one away because they're always all over the floor. I have to say, it is a favorite. I can't keep it on it's shelf. One of the girls is always playing with it. I just wish it was a little bit bigger."
1,Seriously Upsetting,"I have a very diverse taste in movies, and can normally find SOME good in a film.This one, I did not.I found it disturbing, and not in a good way.It was simply two kids raping a mostly-dead-sort-of-zombie girl, over and over and over. Just that. She stayed chained up for most of the movie, getting raped. I found it truly upsetting and wish I'd never seen it in the first place.I SUPPOSE someone of strange taste could enjoy this film, but I don't see how.I WOULD NEVER, EVER RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN,"What a horrible movie. I'm a huge fan of supernatural flicks and horror films but this one was just disturbing. I bought the movie but im contemplating throwing it out. I'd rather throw it out than have someone in my family watch it. Teenage boys having sex with a zombie girl. WTF!!! Seriously!! Couldn't you come up with a better story line. Yea, this movie is totally NOT worth watching. Waste of money and time!!"
3,"Messed up, but oddly engrossing","This review is difficult to write. The movie starts off with a decision that doesn't make a lot of sense. But then it starts showing us this bizarre progression of events... and the odd part is that I actually cared a little about two of the Characters: The Dead Girl and Ricky (one of the guys who seems like he might have a redeeming quality or two).I'm trying to convey my reaction to this movie, but it's hard to do. I'm a bit disturbed. And the fact that I want to know a bit more about what happened afterward says I must have cared at least a bit. But I'm also disappointed in characters, and I find myself not feeling very happy.The production values are good, and I appreciate the effort they put into it.Last bit to mention: Jenny Spain (the Dead Girl) spends every scene she's in nude.If this review seems unfocused and vague... well... that's probably a good representation of my reaction to the movie. Use that information as you see fit for deciding whether to see it."
4,"Brilliant, disturbing and original!!","Despite the few plotholes concerning the end of the film, this movie is a very different, very unsettling and a very well acted breath of fresh air to the horror genre. Jenny Spain puts on a remarkable performance in her silent role and the leads were very well cast. I just finished watching the film not 10 minutes ago and the final creepy frame of the movie is stuck in my head and I'm sure will do the same to anyone who sees it. If you're bored with today's watered down PG-13 crap that Hollywood calls ""horror"", check this film out."
1,Film about delinquents,"Watched a few minutes and shut it off. If you think it's cool to watch a movie where every other word from some loser kid is an F bomb, then this movie is for you.Pathetic movie, cast, and most of all, director."
3,dead girl,"This film was interesting. It proves to show how horny guys are and how desperate they can get, well some of them at least. That's not what this movie is really about though. Two guys find a girl naked and chained and it's about how they deal with it. I kind of figured just from reading the back of the movie cover, what was going to happen here and there. Overall, I liked it. A good friday night horror film."
4,Unexpected for the genre,"Highly recommended for fans of the genre. Deadgirl is not your run-of-the mill zombie flick as what would traditionally be the 'monster' is the victim and vice-versa. A dark and creepy journey through the minds of some disturbed boys, it leaves you feeling like you need a shower. Not for anyone with even slightly prudish tendencies."
3,"Dark, dark, incredibly dark","Deadgirl is all kinds of wrong. The first time I saw this movie, I absolutely hated it. Trying to go in with more of an open mind the second time through, I was able to appreciate how horrific it really is. Rickie and JT are twentysomething high school students (uh, with a BMX bike - See, they're in high school!). Complete degenerates. Guess I had to accept that, too. Anyway, one day while ditching class, smoking, drinking, and vandalizing, they discover a ""deadgirl,"" essentially a zombie, in an abandoned mental hospital. JT develops an unhealthy obsession with her. Yep, there's corpse-screwing. He lets his buddy Wheeler get in on some of the action. They even peer pressure/trick the jock into having his way with her. These guys seem to have no problem doing it in front of other guys. Creepy!"
3,"Not a horror classic, but worth your time and money","I came across a list of the top horror movies of so-and-so while stumbling and had heard of just about every movie except this one so I thought I would give it a try. For the price it was certainly worth it. If you have an hour and forty-two minutes and $2.99, go on, give it a try.Nudity and violence... oh wait, is that a spoiler?"
1,Vile expression of perverse sadism,"Manure on the bottom of my shoe is more appealing than this monstrosity. Because the victim is fantastical, they thought it ok to visit their nightmare on the rest of us. HELL no. Rape is rape. Gang rape is gang rape. Brutal beating is still brutal beating. Whats really scarey are the folks who are entertained by this sick mess. Need I say more?"
1,biggest time-suck EVER!!!,"I went into this one with an open mind, hoping to be pleasently surprised, but ultimately I was beyond let down!!! This movie was SOOOOOOO stupid, and predictable, any true fan of the horror genre could figure this one out easily....I only regret not being able to get the time I wasted back, watching this.It is low budget, and the special effects arent really that good at all, even for low budget. The characters were so dumb and predectible, and the story line just dragged through the whole movie. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE! Trust me people, this really wasnt good at all.Good try, but totally missed the mark...if you want true cult horror low budget films, try something like Evil Dead..."
3,INTERESTING!!!,"Moderately, entertaining! it fits amongst all of the average horror genre movies. The movie has a smooth, steady flow, throughout for the most part. Depending on ur exact preferences, this movie is worth watching."
5,"Original, thought provoking, scary and relentless","I love this movie. It's one of those of movies where you wonder what would you do. We all have the obvious answer to that question but this movie gives you a perspective from the other side. It's nasty, scary, and at times a totally wild ride. For the price, story line and PQ with AQ, this is a must buy."
1,Plot Hole,I found the part about the Deadgirl's bite being infectious and creating immortal dead people not made at all. Did anyone get the idea that Johnny became an undead when he fell upon the bathroom floor? And why did his guts fall out? Did the same thing happen to TJ and Wheeler? They were bitten to. And what about the dog? Did it become an undead immortal? It would have closed the plot hole if they had showed Johnny lying in the hospital and the doctors trying to figure out how he could possible still be alive. Or the dog running around with a big hole ripped in its side.
2,really....??,I've seen this movie twice and both times I got bored. Two guys discover a girl chained up and end up having sex with her. Then the two guys drift apart and a conflict over what's best for the dead girl ensue. One wants to pimp her out and the other wants to free her. Then the pimp gets a replacement friend and the humanitarian friend sets out on a rescue mission to free the dead girl. The only thing that made the movie moderately entertaining was that those who fornicated with the dead girl ended up dead. The movie was rather predictable and the characters seemed rather flat.
2,Not Horror!!!,This is in no way a horror flick. It was actually grotesque. I appreciated the male actor that didn't want anything to do with the dead/undead girl but even in the end he ended up with a dead/ undead girl. Sorry but I like scary movies not sick movies of men basicly raping a helpless dead girl. Someone has a messed up since of life.
1,Movie sucked!!,"Basically, you'll be watching a bunch of immature, low self esteem teenage boys rape a dead girl over and over. At some point, you may think that the characters are going through a phase because they are in high school. But, honestly, all the characters display mental issues, home life problems, and basically it's really about their morals and knowing the difference between right and wrong. The rape scenes are quite disturbing if you analyze it from a humanistic and moral standpoint but if you can't then, eh, it's just a movie. There is NO explanation as to why this girl is dead and still alive. It's not that she's even a zombie needing Brains for dinner. I assumed she was part of some type of experiment gone wrong which left her ""dead-ish"". The ending was a bit cheesy, I wish it didn't end that way. It could have been better."
1,Pure Garbage,"This is no masterpiece the fact that anyone could think other then that is sick and just goes to show what todays mentallity is, the only reason I saw this trash is because I was channel surfing after work one eve and couldn't believe they could have made anything so vile, Im sure the director won't be getting Oscar anytime soon this thing deserves no star"
4,"Strange how people think differently, isn't it? :)","Many are calling this album Pete's best work and such, which I really don't agree with. Mind you, Pete is my favorite artist ever, and I like everything he has done. But I just don't feel this album is his *best* -- it's good, in the sense of having some unique sounding songs and some excellent subject matter, but at the same time it's also perhaps his strangest album, right down to the album's title! :) It's almost like an extension to his ""change"" on The Who's 'Face Dances' album. Luckily after Chinese Eyes, his got back to normal with The Who's excellent 'It's Hard' album, and his own superior and truly best work, 'White City: A Novel'."
2,"OK, But Pete Can Do Better","ALL THE BEST COWBOYS HAVE CHINESE EYES is an OK album, but I'm giving it only two stars because I know that Pete Townshend is capable of making better albums. The song ""The Sea Refuses No River"" strikes me as total nonsense because I have a cousin who went to college where a river meets another river, and I had relatives who lived in that same area. The two stars are mostly for the phenomenal closer, ""Slit Skirts"", which several of my dearest friends over the years have suggested I sing to get my feelings out. Although I realize that they mean well, it's better to get that song on Pete's best-of collection."
4,If you are a Pete Townshend fan,"This is a good album. Probably not for the casual Pete Townshend fan or Who fan for that matter. Pete does capture some great guitar tones and some really hooky songs, and then some are just plain weird, it would be a good addition to a music fans collection"
5,Gweilo Moments,"Wow! A wonderful, heartfelt book about real life experiences. Robin Minietta is a true writer, who grabs you and keeps you reading. From her change at 10, to her realalistic views of adoption, to her families love (and hardships). I laughed and cried, a lot! I can't wait for her next novel. I am so impressed with this author...bravo!"
4,Cool Videos,"Rick james had some cool videos. ""glow"" always cracks me up.hard to believe it's been 20 years.I remember the World Premier of that Video on ""FRIDAY NIGHT VIDEO!! do you remember that show?? super Freak video is a trip.it's a'bout time Rick's Videos saw the light of day.good stuff here."
1,the best of Rick James DVD - a disapointment,"I love Rick James music, it is so exciting. Therefore, I was willing to purchase this DVD, although it cost a lot. However, out of the five videos on the disc, there were only two (2)good ones. That DVD was definitely not worth the price. I felt soo disappointed."
1,piece of resistance?..non non- Piece Of Crap!,"WOW! do you how mush drugs some ""bands""(one man egotistical coked-out projects) must take to be even to ""play""? Well...this album is an example of the 3rd generation of h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e Kyuss wannabes! Run thee other...and FAST!! check out instead 500 ft. Of Pipe, 35007, Kyuss, Stinking Lizaveta, Sunride, etc"
2,"Don't be fooled, this anime sucks","I watched this (s2) on my sister's netflix. It sucked.Wooden, slow, boring. Choppy, crummy animation (with uninspired art style) and the worst voice acting I've ever heard made this a real turd.Is it about a cool subject? Kinda... would've been okay in 1993. But in today's marketplace it just plain sucks."
2,"Repetitive Yoga, not really Dance Yoga","I think the previous reviewer, C. Miller, is reviewing Patricia's Kickboxing DVD and not her Dance DVD listed here...My Review on Patricia Moreno's Yoga Dance Fusion DVD:This is one in a series of four new video that have been release from Gaiam. I love the two with Tanja Djelevic as they are a fun, fun, fun challenging fusion of yoga and cardio. I was hoping this one with Patricia Moreno would be like Tanja's, but I was disappointed as this routine is repetitive, drill like yoga sun salutations. (Also, the music is a bit too loud.) There are better power-yoga like DVD out there."
2,BORING!!,"I've been practicing yoga for 2 years at a yoga studio. I've moved away and decided to try some videos. This was way too slow and boring for me - my mind wandered, I kept yawning. It was awful. I can see it being very good for an absolutely new beginner. Patricia Moreno explains every move in excruciating detail for someone with experience. And you can have a drinking game with the number of times she says ""gratitude""."
4,love it,"I love this video, work out with it regularly in the comfort and privacy of my own home. Patricia has a positive, uplifting spirit that shines through. I'd like it a little better if they had a routine for learning the routine, and then a second routine that flows quickly under the assumption that you've already watched the learning version several times. Even still, it's a great workout, challenging, strengthening, and inspiring!"
2,If I hear gratitude one more time.....,"This DVD looked promising as one that would combine dance & yoga for ""more flow"". The flow was just too slow (and I was looking for something gently) - to the point of being boring.Also, Patricia just kept repeating the same phrases over and over - ""give gratitude for what you are able to do"", ""an expression of gratitude"". I am grateful that I can't do this stuff, but I don't want to keep hearing it for over 1.5 hours....The moves themselves are OK, with some nice combinations and flow, but I wish it would speed up a little."
2,Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor,"Reproducing old important books is a good thing; however, this BiblioBazaar edition is missing Plate I, Plate II, and Plate III. These are esential and great engineering art.PapaTomTheory and Construction of a Rational Heat Motor"
2,Don't wait till you need the Chapstick.,Order your Chapstick overnight early. Why? Because the chances are you will only receive one(1) tube like I did instead of 12. Then you will have to talk to someone India who is very nice and promised to send the other 11 tubes. This was my second order for this product. The last time I received all 12 tubes. So I'm batting 50%. The product itself is very good once you get it. Good luck on your order.
5,Only Lip Balm I Can Use,"I've been using this specific Chapstick product for the past 3 years. Because of a health issue I have dry mouth and consequently dry lips. This is the first and only product I've found which doesn't leave a cakey, gunky coating on my lips because there is no bees wax, etc in its formulation. I was able to buy it locally at Target but it seems they have discontinued carrying the product. To my knowledge ChapStick has not stopped manufacturing it...but I wanted a supply :)"
5,A Big DeChancie Fan,"This is one of the greatest light fantasy series ever. Humor, action, inventive ideas, often brilliant prose...it's all enjoyable. Don't believe any but the five-star reviews. You can't please everyone, but this series has millions of fans. The only thing I want to know is, when is the next one coming out. It's been too long since the last one!"
2,"The Complete Sherlock Holmes, Vol 1","Some of these movies are from HUNGER. The early, early EARLY ones I could barely follow, too dark, too dense, not good sound. A few of the later movies are okay, but you can buy those singularly or in DVDs by title. I would NOT buy this for ANYone.Cecy Ivie"
1,Do NOT read the editorial! Read my complaint FIRST!!!,"The editorial on this page contains spoilers! HOW INCONSIDERATE!!!NO SPOILERS BELOWI am so incredibly disappointed that the ""unknown"" author of the editorial on this page for the book has included a spoiler about the last book that Arthur Conan Doyle wrote about Sherlock Holmes.I am incredibly disappointed in the insensitivity of this spoiler.I am just getting into reading the novels of Sherlock Holmes and was looking for a book with the complete canon works and to my horrible disappointment this editorial spoils the very last book. I am totally crushed.I am also very upset that this editorial does not have the author's name attached. Is that an Amazon policy? In this case, the anonymity is annoying.I ask, PLEASE Amazon, remove the spoilers.Thanks."
3,"A classic, but I wish","I loved Sherlock Holmes as a child, and continue to enjoy reading these classics as an adults. The book is well put together with one exception: Where are all of the original illustrations!?! A good book, but you would be better off with ""The Original Illustrated Sherlock Holmes.""Paul Buckner,Author of ""From Broke to Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom."""
4,Muy Bueno,"Este album aunque no lo escuchado me lo puedo imaginar. Me lo imagino primero por que tengo imaginacion , segundo por que me dio la gana y tercero...realmente ni se por que me lo imagine. Lo que si amigos (pero no de lo ajeno) es que se los recomiendo por el simple hecho que es Guatemalteco Vos!!Puro chapin!! Viva Guate y viva Yo y por ultimo que viva Ricardo Arjona. Salud y saludo a todas las mujeres de Latino America las quiero a todas.Si el Norte fuera el sur?? y asi mi abuela tuviera ruedas seria bicicleta. Bueno pues ya me aburri..Adios"
1,Not For Me.,I bought this book with a couple others because I am pregnant and no longer with the father. However this book is more for those getting a divorce and have older children not babies.
4,Good value,"This album was almost a perfect fit for my needs. It only lacked a pocket (preferably on the back cover) to store the negatives. I solved the problem by putting the negatives in the last picture sleeve between the two pictures.I ordered 30 albums not knowng how to designate color or front cover window design. I was very pleased with the assortment of colors they sent but apparently choice of colors is not an option. Also, the oval window design must not be available as all mine were retangular windows. If any body knows how to designate color or window design, let me know:rloebker@excite.com"
4,I love the mini-albums with the frame-cover.,"'Love these -- but I thought I would receive a combination of the rectangular frames AND the oval frames ... What has happened to the oval ones? Have they been discontinued? Unfortunately, the picture of the items (which shows both oval and rectangular) is misleading..."
2,yuck.,I guess you get what you pay for. Very cheap material especially the cover. I don't like it. It does the job but It doesn't look like it will last very long.
3,You get what you paid for,"This item is very cheaply made but I didnt pay very much for it, so I really wasnt expecting much. Hold 4x6 photos well. I guess I cant really complain."
3,Good brag book,"Small brag book for 4x6 photos, fits in a purse, holds 24 photos. It works fine for the few dollars paid."
3,these are pricey for one ittle plastic photo album,These are ok...they are high priced for what they are.and you do not pick colors...i got lime green and royal blue.
3,Design flaw - so it seems.,"Had this sharpener for over a year before it succumbed to the same fate as some others reviewed here - the bushing that holds the spiral cutter to the gear box is plastic, and is relatively easily stripped, probably with wear and tear or just too much pressure from time to time. I'm going to try another brand, although the Panasonic's performance was good while it lasted...and for the price...."
1,Works good but didn't last - Don't Buy,"Bought this product with Brand Name. Mistake. Concur with other reviews at Amazon. Sparingly used it for 10 months and it finally broke. It is a simple design with a motor. Sounds like the Motor quality is very poor. Don't buy. It is waste of your money.Panasonic KP4A-BK Kp-4a battery pencil sharpener, black, 1 Unit"
4,Best Battery Sharpener I've Used,"I add my kudos with the rest.Super, sharp, poke out your eye point.The exposed lead is not as long as my electric at home. For on the road or at a coffee shop, however, it's the best I've ever tried by far. (And I have tried them all.)Bravo!"
5,Battery Pencil Sharpener,This is the second one I have had - the first lasted over 10 years!! Great product!
5,Perfect sharpener,"This is the best sharpener I've used. It's small, quiet, efficient. It's cordless, but doesn't go through batteries excessively. I'm able to keep it right in front of where I am working to keep my pencil consistently sharp. The first one I owned was only $10. When that one went off to college, I had to get another, and the price had increased. Considering what I'd pay for a lesser model, I considered it a good purchase."
2,disappointed,"I purchased this sharpener because of past experience with this brand.The sharpener totally stopped working after a few months. We tried to have it repaired, but the repair person was unable to do so.I have since purchased a Royal sharpener for half the price!"
4,Best available for Prismas?,"This sharpener is the only one I will use for my colored pencils- and I've tried them all, I think. It is the only one that will put a short point on them, and I realize this review is similar to the one above. What I don't understand is how everyone else above seems to be getting such a long wear out of them, because I go through one of these every 3 months or so, just about the time the warranty wears out (how strange). If anyone has a better sharpener that puts the same short-angle point on these pencils, but last longer than three months, I would love to know about it, especially since Staples no longer carries it in my area."
4,Great sharpener!,I've had this pencil sharpener for 12 years. It works great! I accidentally tossed the blade when I was emptying the shavings.I've bought 3 other sharpeners that do not work...they eat the pencil. I'm going to purchase a new one if I can't find replacement blade.
1,"great, until it breaks",This sharpener is an ideal size and weight. It does a great job sharpening and has plenty of power. I was very happy with it until it broke. The motor ran but the blade stopped turning. I opened it up to find that the teeth had broken off of a cheap little white plastic gear wheel inside. It's useless now.
1,Clogged on 3rd Color Pencil..,"I was so excited about this sharpener.. I've been on the hunt for a good sharpener.. It gave me just the perfect point I've been looking for on the first few graphite pencils I tried.. then I moved to my color pencils.. on the third pencil the lead broke.. after cleaning the broken piece out it now consistently breaks every pencil in the same spot.. :( what a tease to give me the exact point I've been looking for, only to break after a few pencils!"
3,Great but broke after 6 months,"We loved this pencil sharpener. It was easy enough for kids to use it themselves. But after 6 months of working, it just stopped sharpening. Very disappointing. We used it on average to sharpen a pencil a week."
5,Little Wonder,"I had a Panasonic battery operated pencil sharpener for years and loved it. It did as good a job as the expensive electric commercial units. When it died I was lost and couldn't find a replacement, the brands that were out there were cheap garbage. I was lucky to find this one and I LOVE it. Great price and great performance."
3,I've bought a number of these.,"I don't recommend them for children--they'll burn them up. I've used them for many years to sharpen my colored pencils and graphite pencils. Some have lasted longer than others, which is to say quality is hit-or-miss. When they do work, they work very well. At least it's not made by Xacto!Oh--the current Amazon price is WAY out of line. You can get these for $13. Shop around."
5,"Dependable, durable","Great cordless unit with great power. Sharp points in a jiffy. Also, it must be efficient because batteries last a long time."
1,Great sharpening BUT broke after 10 pencils,"I bought two sharpeners. I sharpened about ten pencils with the first one (excellent sharpening while it lasted), and something ""let go"" inside. The motor ran but the rotating blade had no more power - as soon as I pressed the pencil into the blade it would stop turning while the motor continued running freely.I unwrapped the second sharpener to see if it would hold up better. Again, after about 10 pencils, exactly the same thing happened.When I disassembled one of them to analyze the failure, I discovered that a crucial area of the plastic gear that drives the blade mechanism was stripped away so that the gear was spinning practically freely. It was unable to drive the blade mechanism with any significant strength.Conclusion: This product is potentially an excellent pencil sharpener but it has a major design weakness in its drive train. I only put one star on this review because zero stars is not available."
1,Broke after three months,"The sharpener worked fine for a while, then it started making a terrible noise and grining the wood, but not shrpening...not having saved the box or paperwork, I threw it out. I'll go back and get a Radio Shack one next time."
3,worked well but not for too long,This unit was perfect for a couple of years but sadly broke after a few hundred uses. There is a plastic square hole which has to support the shaft of the sharpening assembly and it stripped after usage. Disappointing engineering flaw in an otherwise good product.
5,Works great!,"I bought this for sharpening colored pencils for my artwork. It is of much better quality than most of the other battery operated sharpeners I've seen. It consistently produces a smooth, very sharp point without breaking off the pencil or chewing it up. It has plenty of power to do the job, despite being battery operated."
2,Breaks easily,"We only one child at home who uses pencil sharpeners. We've had 3 of this model die in the past two years. They all die the same way-motor still turns, but won't sharpen, just goes round and round the pencil."
5,The time-tested Classic,"I bought one of these 15 years ago and only had to replace it last month (the motor finally died and surely went to heaven). Before buying, I checked to see if newer ones, even more expensive ones, had any improvements. No way: Panasonic got this design right and stuck to it. I'm a teacher, so I sharpen a few #2 pencils every day and I'm fussy about a good point. This is perfect! Its rotating cylindrical blade (like those in the old hand-cranked sharpeners) makes a sharp but durable point at the standard angle. It's easy to clean and never break points or jams. My batteries last forever. If you need to sharpen a lot of pencils every day, go with a plug-in. If you sharpen crayons or art pencils, get a specialized sharpener for them. But for medium use with regular pencils, this is the time-tested classic!"
5,Great product,I draw with Prismacolor Pencils and have used this sharpener for about 10 years before it stopped working. It is a wonderful pencil sharpener and I give it an easy 5 stars
5,Excellent product,I am an artist and work with colored pencils. This is the best sharpener I have ever used. I would highly recommend it to anyone from students to professional artists. Very good value.
3,loved it for the first four days,I was thrilled to have my first really good pencil shapener-Panasonic KP4a-bk- and it worked perfectly until my room mate jammed her pencil into it and it stopped sharpening and started breaking pencils! It has some part of her pencil stuck in it and I couldn't get it out from between the metal rotating blade and the plastic part of it. Does anyone have suggestions of how to get it out?
1,you can pass on this one,"For some reason I expected more interviews, music and detailed bio that would deal more with group inner problems etc. Instead this DVD turns from lousy to horrible...interviews with people who were around the band during their ups and downs who sadly, can't tell us anything new, that we already did not know... The scariest moments are interviews with band member lookalikes...whoa...scary...Z production"
4,Worth a watch!!,"Although there is no music from the band, it concentrates more on the life story of the band and how they became famous throughout the 80's and into the 90's and now their work today. It is packed with interviews, photos and footage, and includes people that have worked with them like the photographer and man behind their album artwork... It's definitely an interesting film and if you want to know more in depth about the band then I'd recommend it to all..... Good luck with the quiz at the end!!!"
2,No Depeche Mode Music on DVD,"The history of Depeche Mode is promoted by random people who seem to be ""wanna be friends"" of the band. Some of the history is told to you members of a ""Depeche Mode Cover Band"" How embarrassing! You can totally tell Depeche Mode wanted NOTHING to do with this!! Plus the fact they couldn't get permission to use DM music in the video.. I find it VERY hard to watch a documentary of music and NOT hear one song from Depeche Mode. In the very beginning of the DVD you get a line ""This DVD contains NO MUSIC from Depeche Mode"" When they talk about a particular song, like Photographic, you would expect to hear a small clip of it, not another song from some band you never hear of? I think because of that, this DVD lost my interest. Not worth the money in my eyes!"
4,Depeche Mode: Random Access Memory,I honestly wasn't expecting as much behind the scene info as was there. I REALLY enjoyed the video.
2,Not for High School Students,"If you want your high school students to watch a biography of Ernest Hemingway, do not choose this one. It will put them to sleep. I showed it to my freshman and quickly realized the error of my ways. I have never seen the students so disinterested. This biography is for viewers who already have a basic knowledge of Hemingway's life and the times in which he lived. Most of the allusions to other writers and books went over their heads. Additionally, the mood of the piece is somber and sad--it didn't seem to capture Hemingway's spirit. Trust me on this one--unless you have a group of serious, mature students who already know the main details of his Hemingway's life, don't buy it for the classroom."
2,Sketchy at best,"I'm no Hemingway expert, so I watched this for an overview. However, it's not particularly well done, gets off to a very boring start and is handicapped by absolutely nothing from Hemingway himself except some audio of a speech for the Nobel prize. We see bits and pieces from the mostly awful movies made from his books and short stories, but we don't get a good sense of much, except that he was an expert at boiling things down. That we are told repeatedly here. The section on his Cuba years is probably best, and I appreciated the interviews with screenwriter Peter Viertell, but the others interviewed aren't very good, including his son and sister. I'm sure there are better short documentaries out there."
3,good book but can be better.,"Althoug the topics covered in this book are very essential and basic for those who are interested in source coding, but the unsmooth way of presenting the basics and advanced ideas makes the reading of the book a little bit difficult and needs more effort to get even the basic ones. Comparing the way the same topics are presented in other references, it is here too complicated."
1,Total waste of time and money,There is really nothing positive to say about this DVD. It wasn't even mildly interesting or informative. Just BORING. This is the first review I've written and I felt compellled to warn others. The title is totally misleading and obviously chosen to mislead. Don't be fooled.
4,Greatest tool for a keyring,"I've had this on my keyring for several months, and it is really handy. Great for opening packages when you don't have scissors. Well made and it looks sharp. It opens easily once you get the hang of it, and I have not had it come off my keyring by itself. The screwdrivers are useful, though the flat blade, because it is at the top of the ""key"", might be hard to use for a recessed screw. The bottle opener doesn't work very well, but I already have aFender Strobe-E Keychain Tuneron my keyring. This won't replace a Swiss Army knife or a Leatherman, but for something the size of a regular key, it is very useful."
3,Utili-Key vs Jeans. The jeans won.,I enjoyed this handy little tool for several months. It can be a bit cumbersome leaving it attached to your keyring like I did because it's certainly longer than your average key. As a result it has a habit of getting caught in your pockets when you're trying to get it out. One night I was a bit short on patience and was trying to get my keys out to get into my apartment. It got snagged so I angrily yanked the keys out which completely snapped the top hook of the key off. Since it lost the ability to attach to anything it was junk to me so I had to toss it.
2,Was excited but not living up to it.,"The knife is ok and it is a clever tool, but it is so difficult to open to use and it comes disconnected from the keychain so easily that I am afraid of the possibility of it getting lost. I think it could be improved."
2,Broke after a month,"The clasp broke pretty quickly. Also de-attaches pretty easily in my opinion. Useful when it works, though..."
3,keychain tool,"This is a neat design idea, the bottle opener is a little awkward to use, and i wish the knife was a little sharper, but for the price it is handy enough and great for someone who doesnot to carry a pocket knife."
4,"Great product, but mine broke.","This tool is great, I use it all the time! So much more convenient than a pocket knife. Unfortunately I somehow broke one of the teeth off the phillips head on mine, but it still works well. I would still recommend this product."
4,ehhh. Its pretty awesome.... i guess,"Its definitely versatile for its size. It helped me out more than any of my keychains ever did, but something about it just doesnt feel like 5 stars. It's probably the fact that it doesnt do that much. The last swiss key chain i had spoiled me with a knife, nail filer, and even a full size awesome bottle opener! haha So i'm kinda bias....Great for its size. Given the versatility, my previous swiss key chain was huge... haha"
2,Great design... If only it worked,"I bought this for use as a bottle opener. Thing is I cant get it to open bottles. I don't know how hard you have to do it, but seeing as how there is a knife pushing into my thumb, I cant apply any more pressure without cutting myself. I wanted a compact opener, but it doesn't work. If you need a tiny knife or screwdriver then here ya go. I guess its great if you want to fumble with your keys to stab someone, but only with a little knife so that they learn their lesson."
2,More dangerous than useful,"The most useful part of the tool is the phillips screwdriver, something not found in many pocket knifes - but to use it, you must open (and grasp) the very sharp blade. I got a small cut 2 of the 3 times I used it for that purpose, then I quit carrying it."
3,"Good Utility item, but not very strong","I used this product for a while. I would recommend this product but not for someone who has a chunk of stuff on his key chain. I had about 4 keys, one usb drive and this swissgear item. Due to the longer length of this item as compared to standard keys, it is probably subject to uneven forces which causes it to break (the metal loop which loops in the keychain and is the thinnest part). I broke mine within 6 months...so go for it but consider your key chain bunch and the way you (and your kids) use it."
2,Cool tool. Don't buy it.,"I bought this key several months ago and was quite happy with it. The blade is sharp, it turns smoothly, everything was as advertised. However I will say that using the knife can get awkward, as there isn't a great place to hold it... I did manage to avoid cutting myself though.Sadly, it recently begun falling apart. It started when I used the screwdriver on a fairly loose screw and one tine snapped off. Then, it kinda started to slide around without locking (when I bought it it would lock at three different angles). It would occasionally fall off my keychain and finally it completely broke one day just from sitting in my pocket.I am disappoint.TL;DR: It works well but breaks easily. Not worth $10."
5,The best compact multi-tool on the market,"I owned a few multi-tools in my life. I had the compact Swiss army knife, Leatherman micra, and other Asian made models with similar functions. I have to say - THIS IS THE BEST COMPACT MULTI-TOOL on the market. Why? First of all, it is extremely small. Most other compact tools require you to attach them to your keychain, regardless of their design, they will always get in the way of your keys, your car remote .. etc. This thing IS A KEY on your keychain. It coexists with other keys, does not takes up space in your jeans. I work warehouse, and this tool is always a life saver. Opening boxes, cut tapes, bundles, industrial shrink wrap ... I mean I use almost everyday for 6 month, and it is still just as sharp. What else do you want from a $10 tool?If you want a minimalistic compact multi-tool, this is the one you want. Highly recommended!"
4,Excellent in a pinch,"If you're finding that your keyring is just a growing mass of metal, yet you want to carry a pocket knife, this is just the item for you. The Utili-key helps me to open packages and tighten odd screws here and there. It's true that you must be careful not to cut yourself when opening the tool, but once you get the hang of it, it's not an issue any more. My only problem is that it's SO small and unintrusive I sometimes forget I have it when I need a knife!"
4,Great for Travel,"Very good for travel. It allows you to take a minimally useful knife through security. Although this sounds bad, in our overly sensitive times this is a real plus."
1,Piece of junk,"2 separate chargers didn't work on my 7250. Red light, no charging symbol. Tried on multiple cars. Super cheap, super flimsy. Amazon got them both back and paid shipping both ways (love Amazon prime). The Wireless Xcessories one from Amazon was nicer, same price, works fine."
5,Very cool...,This lens totally rocks and is very easy to use. Just read the instructions on how to line up the shot and then cock the shutter and you have one really cool picture. Highly recommend purchasing this baby!
2,"Better for VZW, but needs a better antenna","This was the first VZW phone I've owned that I didn't hate. Which isn't to say I like it though:Pros: Solid battery life. Thin. Fits well on ear, and loud enough to hear in crowded areas. The two way flip and qwerty keyboard.Cons: The antenna is awful. Places where verizon reception used to be fine now aren't. I get a ton of missed calls now b/c the phone never rings. It's hard to dial a phone number on this b/c the buttons are small and each has a number, a letter, and three smaller letters and all are the same color. I got used to it quickly but if you have thick fingers or poor vision I'd suggest taking this for a test drive before you buy it. Last complaint is there's no headphone jack. You have to plug in an adapter (included) and then plug headphones into that."
4,Great value phone except...!,"This isn't a powerhouse phone, but it's also packaged for free or almost-free purchase with activation so what do you expect? However, it is clearly designed with texting in mind and because I text an average of 30 or 40 messages daily it appealed to me for having a QWERTY keyboard and a dictation feature for hands-free. The QWERTY is good, the dictation is okay, but the storage for text messages is absolutely unacceptable. Once my inbox reaches about 45 messages it is full! What gives! My last phone--a mid-grade Motorola--would store hundreds of text messages. Some of those (and we all know this) can be of sentimental value. I am seriously frustrated that I will now have to prioritize which love note is more important than another."
2,Headed back to the store!,"Have had this phone for about 2 weeks now. Enjoy most of the features. Don't like the little pieces of plastic that serve as covers for the ports. Seems like pieces that have already broken off. Keyboard is ok, if a bit small for me.Biggest problem I have is I CANNOT HEAR IT RING!!!!!! Have all the settings turned up as high as I can. But when it goes off in the vehicle (ringer, alarm, etc) I miss it because it is so low. My KRZR (which I will go back to) was plenty loud enough. I got the Samsung as a gift from my wife. Nice phone, but if I can not hear it go off..."
2,Very disappointing,"I bought this phone because I wanted the Querty keyboard for sending e-mail. It is a poor compromise between a Blackberry and a good cell phone. The reception is very poor. While I get service most places I go, it is very hard to hear what people are saying. The clarity of sound is MUCH better on the other phones my husband and kids use. The other challenge is finding the numbers to dial the phone. If you, like me, are of reading-glasses age, you will have to dial the phone by memory of the number locations rather than by sight because the number keys, embedded sideways in the keyboard, are so tiny. Finally, I find that while I can read my e-mail fairly well on the phone (I use Yahoo via the Verizon Mobile Web), sending e-mail is much more challenging. As soon as my service contract runs out I will be replacing this phone with a Blackberry so that I can truly have e-mail on the go and decent cell phone service at the same time."
3,Turns itself off when it feels like it,"I've had this phone for 18 months and have generally been satisfied. I have enjoyed having the ability to flip it to a keyboard for text messaging. Recently the phone has begun to turn it self off, frequently, for no good reason. It must be some sort of planned obsolesence. It would be nice if some manufacturer made a phone that lasted longer than the length of your provider contract."
5,Excellent Phone For The TEEN who likes to text......,"We just renewed our Verizon contract and upgraded our phones. We have a teen that loves to text and she wanted the LG enV. The enV is not practical for a teen to carry around in their pocket so we looked at alternatives and came across this phone. The keyboard size works best with smaller hands and the phone comes with a bunch of fun options (fonts, sounds, etc..) It flips two ways - one for calling and one for texting using the keyboard. You can also us the regular keys for texting. Her friends love the phone too!! As an adult I'm not sure I would like the phone as much but it's a fun phone for teens!"
1,Worst phone in the world,"This is the owrst phone in the world. the keys are wayyy to small and it takes 4 or 5 times to dial a phone number, also it turns itself off. My battery broke because it was in the fog (moisture or something) now my battery keeps on telling me that i put a car battery in it so it can't charge. Worst phone ever. period."
5,I love these Hilighters.,"They have a lot of ink in each one and the bleed easily, but I'm cool with that. More color for everyone."
4,Great Highlighters with a long life!!,"I am a teacher at an elementary school and I like these Zazzle highlighters very much. I personally consider them THE BEST. The very first set I purchased, I used each color multiply times a day and they have lasted me for 2+ years. I just purchased 2 new sets and there is still a touch of ink in the tubes of the older set. They do not dry out quickly like other name brand highlighters. If you are careful and do not press down hard when you use them, the tips do not break down & the ink comes out minimial and does not run. To use them properly, simply highlight or press ever-so-lightly. Not much effort at all. Of course, in any liquid-filled product, you must replace the cap each time or the tip will dry out, briefly, depending on how long the cap was left off. A good shake or a slight touch of water will bring them bring them back to life. They are great highlighters with a long life!!!"
1,Not Good,"These highlighters come in pretty colors, but even without much pressure, so much liquid comes out while you're highlighting that it pools and dries very slowly. I ended up having to sit in class with paper towels to soak up any extra liquid, smudging a lot of the highlights in the process, and therefore having the product defeat it's purpose. This happened to me with all the highlighters in the pack, so it wasn't just one defective highlighter. Stay away from them!"
1,This is not the product I received.,"I ordered these highlighters and although I received these colors, the highlighters I ordered were zazzle and the quality is terrible. Be weary and make sure this item is what is listed."
2,LOL...What Is This?,"A ""gangsta"" selling calendars? LOL. I thought only ""pop"" stars like Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake did things like this? People wake up...this dude is NO GANGSTA!! If you like to look at pictures of a thug, then get this."
3,"Great Design, Poor Packaging","I really like the appearance of this stainless-steel canister. Since I received it only yesterday as a gift, I can't yet vouch for the effectiveness of the canister at preserving the flavor of coffee beans (my intended use). However, I can say that the sticker that's affixed to the exterior took a lot of effort to remove. I soaked it in water overnight but noticed no difference in the outcome. I eventually bought some commerical stain remover (Goo Gone) that took the sticker stuff off. It was a big disappointment to spend 10-15 minutes removing a display sticker from a new purchase. I'll comment later on the practicality of the canister."
3,Interesting Novel,"Hannah MacLeod is happy living her life as a poor waitress in Montmartre. She has a good friend, Toby, who likes to paint pictures of her. Suddenly, her life is turned upside down when she saves a wealthy American, but fears the police are after her. She accepts employment with a mysterious Englishman, who is not what he seems. When Hannah's past is exposed, her life is thrown into tumult. A very good read, though not as good as Brent's other novels."
3,Honest Irish Folk-Rock,"Hothouse Flowers are one of those bands who were destined for global acclaim but it never came. This is a compilation of their best work and includes the infectious 'Love Don't Work This Way', the stomping 'I'm Sorry' and the soulful 'Easier In the Morning'. The music is honest and strong and borne from nature with an almost 'gypsy, carefree feel' to each track. Liam O'Maonlai's voice is haunting and beautiful.(Bono discribes him as having the best soul voice in Ireland). Few music lovers would totally dispel this collection as it has something for everyone. If you have a slight affection to Irish folk-rock music, then this will hit the right notes. Definitely worth the price of the CD."
1,Biggest piece of junk ever made!,"I bought this KVM a couple years ago now, and it's been the bane of my existence ever since. Here a summary of the problems it causes.Boot the PC up one day, and for some unknown reason, KB & mouse are not detected; you have to power down everything, crawl behind your PC, and switch the USB port the KVM plus your KB & mouse into (this KVM converts your PS/2 KB & mouse signals to USB...and therein lies, I believe, to key to it's problems). This problem happens fairly often, such as just about any time you attach a new USB device to your PC; when you reboot, KB & mouse don't work anymore. Also, don't try to connect a USB multi-format media card reader or USB hub; it simply won't work at all with those connected, even after switching USB jacks and rebooting.In short...spend the extra money and buy some other, ANY other, multi-head KVM!"
2,This DVD DOES NOT have Ballet and Opera as it claims,"This DVD calims it has bonus of ""....with The Viena State and Volksoper Ballet..."" and it has a sticker on the front of the DVD claiming the same. However those are NOT on the DVD at all. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out where the Ballet go on the DVD - it's not on IT. It was such a surpise to me because the main reson I bought this DVD instead of its CD version of the concert is that I really like the Ballet (from the live - broadcast on new year's concert).I like products of this recording company ""Deutsche Grammophon"" and I have many CD collections from this company. I just couldn't figure out why this is happenning!!! I was disappointed even though the music was excellent."
2,Insania or Boredom,This one deserves only one listen.Boring heard it before soft attempt at power metal. The musicians themselves aren't too bad but overall nothing grabs you. I could listen to this CD 100 times and still not remember a single song name.Gave it 2 stars because you can buy it cheap. There's a reason why. Don't bother!!!
5,"GREAT ,MAN!",i think this band is really like the great HELLOWEEN. the way they play music and also their song is really coooooooooollllll.
1,TERRIBLE,"DO NOT attempt to watch this show. The production values, acting, plot, all decency goes down the drain. C'mon - the SFX are borrowed from a 1987 show!!! I honestly cannot find any redeeming qualities."
5,Amazing Collection+100% of Profits Fund Parkinson's Research,"This is an amazing collection. It is unique in several respects:1. 100% of the profits fund research to help find a cure for Parkinson's (Parkinson's is a neurological disease that affects an estimated 1 million North Americans -- a cure is considered within reach)2. the 39 songs offer a remarkable variety of artists & genres that I've found appeal to people of all agesThe CD was created by 3 people whose Mom has Parkinson's. The photo on the front shows her holding one of them as a baby. As I understand it, the artists donated the songs.I bought a slew of these CD's as gifts. Friends/family of all ages love the music, & I have the satisfaction of knowing I've supported an important cause."
5,A Nice Stacey Book,"This is a must have for all Stacey fans. And (no offence to Amazon.com) but you could get this book a whole lot cheaper at your local bookstore. Anyway, I would recommend this book to any girl, that reads the BSC, under 11 years of age. (I read this book 2 years ago when I was 10.) -JCP"
4,brings back fond memories,"Watching Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea for the first time in about thirty years, was great,its amazing that I still remembered some of the stories. The black and white production isn't to popular with the kids, but it brought back many fond memmories of my childhood."
2,Poor Quality control,"I love this show dearly, but this DVD set does NOT do it justice. I've repeatedly had problems with discs that freeze. Amazon has been kind enough to send replacement sets, but the problem persists. It's NOT Amazon's fault, they've bent over backward to accomadate me and I appreciate it. The fault lies with whoever failed to do a quality review check on these discs. I've never had this happen before and I am greatly disappointed that Fox flubbed it so badly. Time Tunnel was in the same two sided format and it's OK, absoltely no problem with that series or Volume 1 on Voyage. I'm just so saddened by the poor quality control!"
4,first season of voyage to the bottom of the sea,"This item, volume 2 of the first season had two defective episodes that would not play all the way through. The rest of them were cool.. black and white, but action filled and fun!"
3,Value for Money,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this final first season set of VTTBOTS. Never having seen much of the first season at all, the quality of this show, especially in the first two years is a real eye opener. The effects still stand up well to this day. I can see why re-runs of this show back in the 70's really grabbed me as a kid. David Hedison is a very likeable & solid co-star, Richard Basehart appears such a good actor working under some sort of anaesthetic. Great watching the who's who of guest stars - a pity about the double sided DVD's. Does it really cost that much more to produce single sided discs? Picture quality appears better than the Lost In Space Season 1 release?! Looking forward to watching my colour second season set as well as a possible future Land of the Giants DVD release."
3,A window into the collective social mind of the 1960's,"It's important to know where Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea came from, in order to understand why it was such a popular show. This collection of B&W season 1 episodes showcases the kind of storylines that the studio thought the audience wanted to see. Spys, foreign powers, megalomaniacs, all trying to undermine the capitalist way of life. And somewhere in there, the fearless Admiral and Captain of the Seaview thwarting every attempt. As a cloak & dagger effort, it succeeds well. But it was only a forerunner to the later seasons, which changed the focus to a more prevalent science-fiction theme. One episode of exceptional note is the Human Computer, a masterpiece of film-noir that is just as nail-biting today as it was when first aired. You need to see these episodes to fully appreciate the transformation that the series made in Season 2 and beyond."
3,"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea , Season 1 Vol. 2",Loved the show however three episodes on the first disc and at least two on the second disc were flawed (play would skip and sometimes stop all together several times while watching - this was for each affected episode).
5,Irwin Allen in Glorious Black & White,Yes Its Part 2 of the First Season of Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea. This was their best season and good fun.Fair reasonable plots and good dramatic acting.Good Price for this series.
4,DBZ Shin Budokai Another Road,The game is great. The item shipped in due time in a sealed package.I enjoyed the service.
5,DBZ,I want to know if this game updates your psp. If it does then does anyone know what it updates it to.I heard that this game is really good. I think its going to be the best DBZ game ever.
5,I've been waiting for this book....,"This book is the perfect marriage between process improvement methods and Rob Lawton's Creating a Customer-Centered Culture. Ken has provided a clear roadmap for organizations to get focused on the customer, measure things that the customer cares about, and achieve those results with the least amount of pain and agony.I have already recommended this book to several of my clients who are starting (or are already on) the journey of using teams, focusing on the customer and improving their organizations. It has everything you need, so it's a great reference book as well."
3,Childhood and Adolescence: Voyages in Development by Spencer A. Rathus,Was helpful in the class with the way the instructor taught. The author uses his children a lot to show examples of how the theories match but not soo much that you didn't get the needed information from the content.
2,More worthless reading,"aside from the nice paper quality and binding, this is a book NOT worth having on your bookshelf. it contradicts itself as much as it tries to discredit dan brown. it uses fantasy and fact to misdirect the reader.page 86 tells us that, ""...there is no evidence that the New testament was was rewritten in the fourth century at the direction of Constantine.""page 87 tells us that, ""...Council of Carthage in 397...Constantine ordered Eusebius to put together fifty Bibles with approved texts to make an official Christian Bible...It is possible that Constantine's Bible had an influence...but we cannot say.""she denies the point of view, presents evidence can could justify a differing point of view, then tells us that it is inaccurate spin on history. duhh!! brown wrote a FICTION novel based on facts, spun for entertainment purposes. similar to what Oliver Stone did with JFK.the truth comes out eventually, why else would it be criticized and discredited so much?"
5,A factual and enjoyable book,"After reading the Dan Brown novel, I am extremely happy that someone has finally written a book on the topic that is factual, has a great bibliography and beautiful and related paintings. The book was written in such a way that the author leads you through each section, and each section is fully explored. Great book!"
1,Sharpens unevenly,"This sharpener does not sharpen correctly. After reading the reviews, it is evident that this product is defective, yet the company continues to sell this product. If you use this sharpener, you will waste your pencils since it only sharpens one side of the pencil. I am not pleased with the fact that I have a sharpener that is unusable."
3,Tooooo Thinnnnn !!!!,"First the positive.. It looks great !!.. It fits perfectly where I mounted it !!.. Now the negative.. The gauge is toooo thinnn.. I mean way too thin !!!.. I'd love to have a pencil sharpener exactly like this one, but only 5 times as thick.. it's just too flimsy !!.. also the size adjuster wheel is a joke..it's extremely thin & if not held in place the pencil will only sharpen on one side.. so the trick with this sharpener my kids have learned is to turn the pencil as you sharpen it.. & it'll do the trick.. but my suggestion is to buy an older model.. from a antique store.. which is where I'll get my next one !!!"
1,Lasted 4 weeks,"I purchased two of these for our PT doctorate program because they were so highly rated. We currently have 60 students and many bring their own pencil sharpeners so these were getting minimal to average use. Both were broken within a 4 week period! I was very disappointed and would NOT recommend. After having the sharpeners looked at to see if they could be repaired, we were told aside from the actual blades, they use cheap parts. Don't waste your money."
2,One Sided,"My sharpener also only sharpens on one side, I try spinning the pencil and sometimes I'm satisfied but the children cannot get it to straighten out. I would not get this again and after 6 months I'm back on here looking for a new one."
1,Manufacturing defects had to return,"Redesigned for manufacture in china this sharpener no longer offers long life and worry free use. Out of the box crank was on crooked, screws holding it together were stripped. The eight hole front pencil guiede is flimsy. The design will not stand up to class room use. Look else where."
3,Used to be better.,I have two of these - made in USA circa 1950s or 1960s. The original models were made of heavy cast metal with chrome plated steel sides. They offered a point adjustment that moved the cutting heads closer or farther apart. And they size wheel was a solid cast piece.This - while it has some of the best cutting heads on a pencil sharpener - doesn't measure up to the original Boston Ranger 55 sharpener. Still nice to be able to order one new instead of hunting through auction sites.
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Several reviews said this pencil sharpener was heavy duty and worked very well. I teach school and have yet to find a sharpener that will consistently sharpen the poorly-made pencils in my classroom. I purchased this one in hopes that it was do the job. Unfortunately, it sharpens on one side of the pencil so it was a waste of money."
2,Very Hard to Unjam,"This sharpener worked very well until a pencil lead got jammed. Taking it apart was not near as hard as getting it back together again. Now it's pretty useless. So it lasted less than a year, with infrequent use. Much worse track record than my previous electric sharpener. Does anyone know of a mechanical, non-electric sharpener that is easy to unjam?"
2,Not so good,"I bought this sharpener right before school starts this year. Initially, it worked well. Now just a couple of months later it pretty much is worn out. We only used the sharpener weekly, so it has not been heavily used really. We are not happy and I wouldn't recommend this product."
2,"High price, cheap materials (made in China), but seems to sharpen well","I had been looking for a sharpened that had dual cutters because I know this style sharpens pencils more consistently the the single cutter style. Once I saw that this product had that, I was sold. However, this sharpener burned me...I took it out of the package and opened up the shavings container and the thin metal clasp immediately sheared off. I didn't put any unnecessary force on it, it just broke while I was closing it. This made me look and sure enough it was made in China. Had I known about that I would have avoided this product, especially with it's high price."
2,Sharpens off-center,"I think I've seen a few other reviews that mentioned the uneven or off-center, sharpening of this but I liked the design and with overall 4-stars I thought I would give it a shot.Has been sharpening pencils off-center from the moment it came out of the box, e.g one side of the point is all ""lead"" and the other is mostly wood. I disassembled it thinking it may be something that I could adjust but was not successful (I may even have made it worse). It sounds like this was an excellent product at one time but it now seems quality is sporadic.Pros: It is a nice looking sharpener, is sturdy and sharpens pencils without breaking the tipCons: Sharpens off-center (severely)."
3,X-Acto function,Nice retro design - function more or less ok - nothing to cry for. It is very simple and seems not to be so solid.
5,Great Product for the Price!,"I remember when I was in school back in the 1960's these pencil sharpeners were standard in any classroom. The one I just received works great! It sharpens pencils evenly all the way as long as the graphite stick is centered around its wood case. To me this is inportant because I had purchased other manual pencil sharpeners in the past and found that the pencil was not sharpened evenly all the way around even though the graphite stick was centered.Other features that I like about this sharpener is its black finish, beefy construction, and its easy removable receptable. I have tried other manual pencil sharpeners in the past and so far I believe that this is the best for the price."
1,Inferior Product,"Do not buy this sharpener. In spite of a previous review that said it sharpened off center, I bought it anyway because the reviewer thought it might be the fault of the pencil. Well in my case, every pencil it sharpens has the point off center, and it's so bad that there is wood remaining on one side of the point almost all the way to the tip.This is by no standard a ""heavy-duty"" sharpener: The sharpener has a light-weight feel compared to older sharpeners, the screws are too thin and short to allow you to mount it securely (I used my own screws instead), the rotary motion has a ""sticky"" feel compared to other heavy-duty sharpeners I've used, and the conical wood surface it makes is slightly rough compared to quality sharpeners.I bought the Ranger for my home office, but after seeing how poorly it works I threw it away and replaced it with a 40-year-old sharpener I found in my basement."
3,Great! . . . in theory.,"A greatly well made pencil sharpener with a few janky problems. Mainly, its a huge pain in the ass when the tip of your pencil breaks inside of it, and it happens way too frequently. I've had other electric sharpeners that escaped this problem somehow. Maybe there is a perfect sharpener somewhere... The only way to make it function again is to take it apart, and remove the broken pencil tip from the innards. I just want to draw! Oh well. If you sharpen more carefully it won't happen too much, but I'm afraid this problem is inevitable. Mostly, its a well made sturdy machine."
3,Bait and Switch,Did not receive the correct item. Company would not exchange for the one advertised. Would only let me return at my expense. X-Acto K-S is the sharpener that I received and it is ok. Buyer beware!!!
5,The Mack Daddy of manual pencil sharpeners,"I was gifted this by my wife since I've been needing one in my wood shop.Goods: Rugged, large tray for shavings, quick grinding and great result.Bads: In my case the mounting screws were too tiny. No big deal.In the event a problem comes up with it I will come back and remove this, so if you're reading it, it's all still true.charitablewoodworking.org"
5,VERY HIGH QUALITY - Love the retro style!,We are a home-school family and I was so frustrated with crummy pencil sharpeners. We'd had very bad luck with every pencil sharpener we'd gotten from the local department and office stores. I finally shopped Amazon and I really liked the look of this one. I'm so so pleased! I love the retro style. It was easy to screw into our school table top. It is EXTREMELY well built and sharpens pencils in seconds. My kids absolutely love it!!! There is not a dull pencil in our house.
1,dont understand positive reviews,I am a homeschooler and most sharpeners don't work straight from their packaging . I was really excited to get one that was reviewed positivly only to find it is worse than the one i have now. It doesn't even sharpen out of the box. Save yourselves the trouble of purchasing garbage.
3,"No Screws, No feedback","The discription on the Amazon web site clearly shows mounting screws are included. The unit delivered to me had no screws. Not really a big deal, I've got plenty of screws laying around. But what was frustrating was trying to figure out how to tell Amazon. Apparently short of returning the unit, there does not appear to be a simple way of telling Amazon. I don't even want Amazon to send me screws, but as I bought this through Amazon Prime, I thought they should be aware and take some action with the manufacturer. I buy primarily though Amazon, but I am ALWAYS frustrated when I try to contact them about anything. To me the one big failing of Amazon is how hard they make it to contact them. No email address, no phone number, I'm not even sure if there is a mailing address."
4,Good Purchase,"I bought this sharpener because we have several children whom we have enrolled in our home school. We have frequent need of sharpening pencils and some use of sharpeners that is...well, less than gentle. We've have this one for six weeks and have had crayon jammed into it, pencils pushed too far and roughly into it, and frequent use. It is holding up very well to all that. It was a bit tricky to figure out the wall mount, but it is now securely placed. Even though this is pricier than some others, I am happy with the purchase for the kind of use we exercise."
2,"Not bad, but poor recording","Pros:- Excellent performance of sonata no 15, a little bit too fast I think.Cons:- I can hear hiss noise on the recording. Maybe the recording mic is not very high quality.- The Steinway piano used in this CD produces poor sound."
1,Died in less than 4 months,"I bought this back in March, and by July it no longer worked. Of course, Amazon won't let me return it since I've had it for more than 2 months. Don't buy it!"
4,pencil sharpener,so far it's ok. I use it in my classroom and sharpen my students pencils all day. It makes them very sharp. They have a tendency to break pretty easy.
2,A one day wonder,"I received the pencil sharpener this afternoon, unpacked it and started using it right away. Unfortunately, after sharpening about 25 pencils the sharpener stopped working. The unit was very warm so I unplugged it for about an hour and tried again. No luck."
1,Great while it worked,"With great excitement and enthusiasm my girls went to work sharpening our many, many dull pencils. This thing was amazing for 20 mintues and then died."
4,pencil sharpener,This sharpener gets a lot of use in my classroom. It is holding up well and works efficiently on many types of pencils.
4,Sharpens well,I purchased for my son. It occasionally sharpens one-sided but it always has a good point.
5,Good buy,"I like this pencil sharpener, it is strong enough to sharpen many pencils at one time. Comparing with our old cheaper electric sharpener, this one is worth the money."
1,Worked for a while.,"I purchesed this pencil sharpener for my 4th grade classroom in Feb. of 2009. We started using it in March-May of 2009, were off for summer break until Aug. 2009 and it is no longer working Dec. 2009. Our school maintenence personel looked at it. There is nothing stuck in it...it will work if you jiggle the pencil around. They said it seems as if it has just gone dull. My money is precious to me as a low-paid teacher. I won't buy a Panasonic sharpener again."
4,It just works,"I can't tell you how many cheaper pencil sharpeners I tried until I realized Panasonic had this one. It's been perfect. Nice and sharp and consistent. No problems. I'd highly recommend it, especially over anything in the Xacto line for homeowners/small offices.Update: Nov 3, 2008 - it died the other day. Nothing...just dead. The safety switches are working, but it's like the motor is just a goner. Disappointing."
5,IT WORKS!,"A pencil sharpener that works. Seems such a simple quest -- and yet it has taken several to find this one. To me, it seems pricey for such a simple item -- but yet in total, I've spent three times that searching for one. This one WORKS. It sharpens the pencil evenly all the way around. It let's you know when it is done and sharpened. The deal of a lifetime!"
5,"Finally, a pencil sharpener that SHARPENS!","You wouldn't think it would be hard to find a pencil sharpener. Heck, my expectations are pretty simple: sharpen pencils. Finally, I found this one that actually accomplishes this goal. Panasonic's model sharpens the pencils to a nice point without grinding the pencil down to nothing and with only minimum effort. The action is fast and not like many of the other models we tried that made me wonder if the sharpener would ever be done! I can't rave enough about this Panasonic product as frankly it had us all excited over just how well it did the job. It's a bit costly but worth every dime!"
5,Best Sharpener ever had,"Love my new electric pencil sharpener. After reading the reviews on Amazon on all the sharpeners, I chose this one since it was rated so high. It has great sharpening power, autostop once the pencil is sharpened, and so quick and easy to get all my kids pencils sharpened for school. I used to struggle with those stupid manual sharpeners, but now with 3 kids in school, now way was I going to sit there all night sharpening their pencils plus colored pencils. Don't know why I didn't think of buying one sooner. Best investment."
5,Best ever!,"I have taught for seven years and never found a pencil sharpener last as long as this one. I have about 75 kids per years, and this definitely held up. After two years I finally need to buy a new one, but that far exceeds the two to six months of other pencil sharpeners. My sixth graders are also not so gentle on things. I will be buying a new one for the next two years."
2,Worked great until it died,"Works really well. There is no comparison to the ones that use batteries or a razor blade to sharpen the pencil. Unfortunately the unit died after about 3 months of use. Not sure what happened but it acts as if it is getting no power. Problem with its tiny logic board perhaps?I am going to hope that the burnout was a fluke and buy another one; it does its job that well, when it works anyway."
4,Great Sharpener,The first sharpener came with a small manufacturing defeat. Amazon's wonderful return policy worked great and I had a new one within days. The sharpener works great and does the job needed here at school.
4,pencil sharpener review,"I bought two pencil sharpeners from Walmart and promptly returned them. With the one the pencil opening wasn't big enough and the pencils got stuck, and the other chewed up the wood on the pencils. This one is black and sits on my kitchen counter next to my phone. It's not tiny but it's narrow. My kids and I use it often. Easy to use, quick, and sharp points. I've only had it for about 2 months. If this pencil sharpener lasts along time I'll give it 5 stars."
4,great sharpener,"The best sharpener ever. But it arrived with a tiny chip off the plastic drawer, which prevented the sensor from seeing that the drawer was closed. So it didn't work, but my some miracle the plastic chip was in the drawer, I just taped it in place, and it works fine."
4,Much better than other brands,"I bought this pencil sharpener based on the other reviews written here. So far, it works very well although the sharpening speed is a little slower than some other brands. Overall, I like it a lot and it is _much_ better than the X-Acto brand sharpeners sold at Staples which only work properly for a few months."
5,Best pencil sharpener ever,"My dad was a commercial artist in the 70s and 80s and had a panasonic pencil sharpener. I loved it. It is so durable that I still have it today. When the teachers at my son's school asked for a new sharpener for their workroom, I knew exactly what to buy for them. It is an amazing product."
2,Loved it for a few months...then it DIED,"I really enjoyed this pencil sharpener. I used it for my classroom, so it saw a lot of use! It was quick, sharpened well, and only I operated it. It worked from April until the next December and then it suddenly died! It was past its warranty and return date, so I wasted a large sum of money on a pencil sharpener."
2,Not durable,"This sharpener worked fine for a few months of light use, but it recently stopped sharpening. I opened it up and discovered that the sharpening ""blade"" had moved out of position so it was not contacting the pencils. I couldn't figure out a way to correct this, so it's now unusable."
5,Best pencil sharpener ever,"I've tried a many different pencil sharpeners and they have all left me frustrated - until this one. If you have to sharpen a lot of pencils, this one is worth the price. My kids all want to sharpen their pencils now, even if the pencil doesn't need sharpening!"
1,Kids afforded a short life for this sharpener,"I have a dead KP-380 pencil sharpener. We guess we've had this sharpener a grand total of two, maybe three months. We bought it at the beginning of the 09 shool year, sharpened 50-100 penciles (yes we emptied the shaving tray), and that was it. I took it apart today and found no voltage across the contacts. The wires trace back to separate locations on the main board (no voltage there either). I suspect the transformer is shorted. It was plugged into a power strip with surge protection. Could have been lightning, but the other components plugged into the strip are all OK. Quality seems OK, no pencil dust in the motor compartment. We're stepping up to an industrial strength sharpener."
1,Does not work!!!,"I recently picked up this iron also at Walmart. Based on my experience with my friend's B&D iron (a different model though), I was hoping to replicate the same experience. After bringing it home and filling it with tap water, I tried to iron a 100% cotton shirt but, it simply did not iron. The wrinkles would not go away even after applying massive amounts of steam, maximizing the heat setting, ironing slowly with increased downward force... nothing would get the wrinkles out. I finally gave up after 10 minutes. Its going back."
1,First impressions can be deceiving - only lasted a few years,"We bought the iron in 2003 or 2004 and today it produces no heat at all. We're a family of two, and the iron was in storage for a year and a half while we were overseas. Consumer Reports likes the Steam Advantage iron. Spend the extra $10 and get that one instead."
4,A Great Resource for Aspiring Movie Extras,"Author and veteran movie extra Jo Kelly candidly shares her experience in the field of background acting for films in Los Angeles, CA. Included in this handy guide is contact information for casting agencies and casting agenies, calling services, production studios, and tips for how to join the Screen Actors Guild. The business of background acting (from tracking expenses, finding the location of the shoot, and where to turn for tax preparation help) are also covered. This is an excellent gift book for any aspiring actor interested in learning the ropes of show business and finding his-or-her way around LA. Give one to your community theatre director and pass the information on to others who'd like to work as a movie extra."
1,not received,have not received this yet where is it ? how do I get it ?this is theivery .wher's my recourse in this
3,not perfect,"I was disapointed. Its smelled more like eau de toilett, then eau de parfume. It would be better to buy the tester for me."
3,a surprisingly good adventure,"i am not a regular reader of fiction, but since i enjoy history, i thought this book might be worth a shot. in fact, it ended up being a very enjoyable adventure, and remeniscent of the sorts of book i read 40 plus years ago when i was a boy.based upon a diary, it recreates the world of aviators during the first world war. these men were more like the knights of old than soldiers. in any case, an enjoyable read... and you'll be sorry when it ends."
4,The Ultimate Bond Companion,"Who was the First Actor to Play James Bond? What does EON stand for? What was the only non-bond project did Broccoli and Saltman collaborate? These are only a few of the questions this exhaustive and well researched volume contains. But its not just trivia. In it you can find out how Bond came to the screen, The origin or Maurice Binder's famous opening sequence, and the true story behind the infamous ""garlic incident,"" as well as synopsis' of all the films (including the non EON productions.) If you love Bond, then this book is for you. The answers: Barry Nelson, Everything or Nothing, ""Call me Bwana."""
2,Don't buy this garbage!,"This is definitly not the ""complete Bond film book"", It's rather the most unfinished I've ever seen. The reviews are too short and he never really explains why he's taken the opinion he does.There will never ever come a complete Bond book, But if you're a serious fan, read Chapmans's Licence to thrill or Raymond Benson's The James Bond companion instead."
2,"This is good, not the best!!","This book is good if you want some minor facts that have been exhaustively researched. I bought my copy in May of 2002. It makes it seem that the movies are junk and you are wasting your time. A better Bond book is The Essential Bond, by Lee Pfeiffer. This one tells you about gadgets, cars, villians, and the sexy Bond girls. I rate this one 5 stars!!"
5,Must Read,Spurgeon is a must read. His direct style of writing is refreshing in today's world where so many people beat around the bush.
5,Solid Biblical teaching,"You can count on Spurgeon to give sound Biblical teaching. He digs into God's word and teaches from God's perspective. He knows that God's word doesn't change with current times and events, and that is why Spurgeon's writings are still relevant so long after his death. The teachings are challenging but encouraging. Any searcher would benefit from going back to these older teachers."
5,Good Old Dickie. Where's Lita Rosa?,"I used to dance to Ted Heath at the Oxford town hall. His singers were Dickie Valentine, Lita Rosa and Dennis Lotus. Dickie was always the one girls liked the best. I have this record and it reminds me of when I was 20 years old, dancing away the night. Good singer. Ron."
4,DvD on Various Basic Aspects of Modern Witchcraft explored+,"Interesting starter's look at the practise of 'Witchcraft'.Where are the real 'Warlocks'? Stage magicians presented from the 'Magic Castle'.The art of hypnosis and love spells are explored and examined.The synergy between Africian 'Vodu' and Creole Cajun Christianity revealed and performed.It seems these various episodes were filmed for Geraldo Rivera's investigation show,during the early 1990s.The DvD is still good for beginner witches,yet it's rather light on wizardy topics.And nowhere,are the heavier and more practical issues such as occultism,stopping environmental ruin,healing the Earth,veganism,home gardening,or even bread baking discussed.It's worth seeing once,yet don't be fooled by the cover.It has nothing to do with the history of the 'Burning Times' or the real modern practise of witchcraft divination."
3,Quality could be better,"Yellow was the first one to quite working on me, I went through 3 of them during one college semester.Pink was the second one to quit on me.Green was really liquidy and took forever to dry. It has been soaked through the paper of my textbooks.Orange is probably the best one in the whole set. It still works, doesn't soak through the paper and isn't too dark.Blue is my second favorite. It is a bit dark for a highlighter, but it doesn't soak through the paper and it still works."
4,Pleased With Scratching Post,"I am very pleased with the Catnip Scratching Post. It conveniently hangs from the doorknob on the hall closet and every time my cat passes, he stops to do a little scratching. It seems to satisfy his natural urge to scratch."
5,Finally get your diet straight!!,"I'm so glad I bought this book! I knew I needed to eat better, but found it tough to break the fast food cycle. This book gave me the incentive and the motivation to take control of what I eat. It gives you lots of options, including how to still eat beef in a healthy way, which is exactly what I do, in moderation and in small portions. It also shows you how to shore up your diet with more whole grains, fruits and vegetables. A previous review seems way off base--this book does NOT ""push"" soy recipes at every turn. There are very few soy recipes. It also doesn't say that beef is evil. On the contrary, the authors explain how beef can be a healthy part of a healthy diet...if you eat it in a healthy way!! I really recommend this book. Knowledge about the food you eat is ALWAYS better than ignorance, and this book is full of knowledge and sound, sensible nutritional advice. Read it and feel better the very first day."
2,Great Sharpener until the cheap plastic gears break!,"After going through many electric pencil sharpeners in my elementary classroom, I decided to bite the bullet and spend over $100 on this sharpener. I expected it to last several years. It worked very well for about 18 months. Then it just made a loud grinding noise when a pencil was inserted.Because I am somewhat mechanically inclined, I opened up the sharpener to figure out how to fix it. To my dismay, I noticed that the plastic gear that was responsible for turning the cutter wheels was broken. The pencil sharpener isn't fixable. I'm just posting this so that anyone who purchases this pencil sharpener will know that it might not last as long as expected."
1,broken plastig drive gears,"The plastic!! gear that rotates the cutters is broken and no replacement is available. I would expect a very expensive pencil sharpener such as this to literally last forever, or at least a few years. At the very least, it should have rugged parts.I found out that no replacement parts are available due to ""lack of demand."" Also found out it has a 2 year warranty. call their warranty number and it explains that you have to fax in Model #, shipping address, Proof of date of purchase, and description of failure. Fax to Danielle at 800-741-6046.hope this helps."
1,"Not ""Commercial"" grade! False description","I bought this sharpener 2 years ago. It worked fine. I am a math teacher, so I sharpen about 40-50 pencils a day, by no means a ""High Volume"" or ""Commercial"" use. Two months out of warranty, it simply died. I paid $125 dollars for a ""High Volume Commercial Grade"" sharpener and it can't handle 40 pencils a day?!! And the pencils I sharpen everyday are not brand new, only dulled from use. They said out of courtesy they will allow me to send it in, but cannot promise me anything. This is code for, "" We will be sending you a paperweight back to you"". DO NOT BUY THIS!! I am currently researching other sharpeners that are less expensive that I bet will last 2 years."
2,Electric Pencil Sharpener,"I used to have the original model of the this when I was teaching school and it worked FOREVER! I bought this one for myself and it failed after a few months; I was sent another one. They obviously lose money when they build them to last like the original ones, but they really went downhill with this one!"
1,until the plastic gear breaks....,"This pencil sharpener is wonderful--until the plastic gear breaks. I shelled out nearly $300 for two of these sharpeners, and this happened to both of them. There are no repair parts available. Read reviews of this sharpener on other sites. This is a VERY common problem!"
5,Pricey but worth it.,"Takes about two seconds to quickly sharpen your pencils.We purchased it for our home, we were tired of replacing cheap pencil sharpeners, so thought it was worth investing in.Thus far we have had no problems with it, does the job perfectly and quickly.And even though it is bulky, I think it's better that way (especially with kids in the house - always dropping things)."
1,"""High-Volume"" of money spent/wasted","My elementary school spent a good amount of budget money on a handful of these pencil sharpeners. They were distributed around the school (for teacher use, only) with notes attached to each one, ""Please Empty Drawer After Each Use."" We took such good care of those pencil sharpeners, guarded them from misuse and within a year, they all started to die right around the same time. My husband is an engineer and when I brought them home, he dismantled them, only to find the plastic gearing had cracked and chipped itself into an irreparable state. The company sent him new plastic gearing for a couple of them but those only lasted for a couple of months. We are currently shopping around for alternatives since this was a hugely expensive lesson we all learned. The ""high-volume"" advertised in the description of this pencil sharpener only refers to the amount of money you have wasted. Keep shopping!"
1,Plastic Gears Will Fail (Junk),"I have the Model 41 circa 2007 which was purchased for use in a 3rd grade class. It lasted just over two years before the plastic carrier gear lost all its teeth. When it worked, it was great and is truly heavy duty. Now that the carrier gear has no teeth the sharpener is a $130 paper weight. Oh and parts, no way. X-Acto does not sell the carrier gear for this model anymore. They do sell the gear for Model 41's made before 2005...say what? Yep, crazy and everything that is wrong with manufacturing today. One cheap plastic gear and now a perfectly good sharpener goes to the landfill. Only buy this if you want to ""rent"" it for about $50 per year, if you are lucky."
1,Got a defect,"I think I got a defective pencil sharpener. Within days, it started making some funny and loud noises. I have requested to return it."
5,good sharpener,"I'm a teacher and was so SICK of having useless pencil sharpeners. I finally bit the bullet and bought this one. The first one I recieved broke fairly quickly...but I had had a substitute for a few days, so perhaps she knocked it on the ground! Nevertheless, Amazon replaced quickly, and I love it!"
5,Excellent Sharpener,"Exactly as described, this is a true heavy-duty sharpener. I am delighted with the heft of the machine and the quality of the sharpening. At our bridge club we have tried LOTS of sharpeners at all price points below this one. This is unquestionably the best. Worth the money."
4,The Xacto Sharpener you need for your classroom,"This sharpener is among the best. It is a tireless workhorse, making quick the time spent sharpening, what seems to be, an endless amount of pencils each day. With the ability to change the blades and such a great 10 year warranty, this sharpener earns a 4 star rating.When sharpening standard ""adult"" sized pencils, you can feel when the pencil is sharp; however, this sharpener does not give any feedback when it reaches a point on larger 2nd/3rd or Kinder/1st grade size pencils. Additionally, this sharpener does not have either an automatic stopping sensor or a pencil point adjustment. These two features would put the finishing touches on, what is, one of the best sharpeners. Without these features, I can't give more than 4 stars."
1,Pencil Sharpener died after 3 weeks of use,I bought this pencil sharpener in early August. I am a 4th grade school teacher. This expensive sharpener ($[...]) died the week of Labor day. I am very unhappy. This expense came out of my own personal money. How sad for me!!!
1,Elementary School disappointment,"I purchased 3 of these machines and none of them have stood the ""heavy duty"" test. We have 600 plus students and obviously go through many pencils. The inexpensive pencil sharpeners that were purchased are still going although they have to ""rest"" occasionally but the ""heavy duty"" sharpeners just break. I'm very disappointed and frustrated.X-Acto High-Volume Commercial Electric Pencil Sharpener, Beige, 1 Unit (1606)"
1,Quit working,"Our school bought this on 8/2/12 and it has already stopped working. As of today, we have not been able to contact the manufacturer to see if there is a warrenty on it. Purchase at your own risk."
3,plastic,This is an expensive pencil sharpener yet its plastic construction and somewhat clunky appearance make it a disappointment. It does not seem as solid and sturdy as it should. It points pencils in a satisfactory way however and may be better than the competition. I have had several other pencil sharpeners which have not held up well in spite of not very heavy use. Whatever you do never buy a battery driven pencil sharpener.
1,...and Now it's BUSTED!,"Worked great...for a few months...until it broke. Just makes a humming noise when I insert a pencil. Totally, absolutely jammed. I have no idea how to fix it -- or where to send it. Anyone?"
3,He's OK,"This guy does have some good stuff going on. Written some time back, there are some methods that have been shown to be damaging such as bumping a dog in the chest to prohibit jumping. The physiology of a dog's chest is such that even a gentle bump at the wrong angle can crack or even break the breast bone. So other methods have been developed for that behavior since this book was written.Overall, Bash does a fairly good job of describing tried and true methods that have been in place for eons. But one must realize there are more ways than one to train a dog. Read the dog and determine a training plan that will suit that animal. One size does not fit all."
2,Underplayed strengths,"2 1/2Only really triumphs in gripping stretches of eastern-styled acoustic soloing, though it feels rarely implemented here over duller, sluggish ruminations."
5,excellent read!,This book was absolutely fascinating! I love reading about other cultures. You may not find the absolute answer of what happened to Michael Rockefeller but you will get the feel of the world he lived in right before he disappeared. It's one of the best books I have read in a while!
2,Not for school.,I am a school teacher and I purchased this sharpener for my classroom. It didn't work for very long. I eventually had to throw it away. I was very unhappy with this product.
2,"Great at first, poops out fast","We bought this pencil sharpener for our art center. It lasted about a year before it died. We paid $40 for it, expecting that it would last a long time. But it seems to last just as long as the cheaper ones. At the beginning, it worked really well. Maybe if you aren't putting as many miles on it as we are, it will last longer."
5,Love it!,Awesome workout! Gets me sweatin big time! I love all the hops and leaps she adds in! This is one everybody needs to have in their collection!
4,Not bad,"This work out is pretty challenging and you will sweat. It gets a bit boring after a few times, but you'll still get a work out. The girls in the back are quite annoying, but Amy is not so bad. Although Amy recommends 3lb weights, i use 5lbs and i'm thinking of moving up a few pounds. i guess it all depends on your level. The speed between exercises is a decent pace and you get plenty of repetitions/sets. I also recommend the body circuit work out by Michelle Dozoi called ""total body breakthru - body circuit"" (or something along those lines, I can't remember the exact word) which is bit more challenging I think."
2,Unable to do any type of fast forwarding or replay on this DVD,"This is my first workout DVD, so I don't know if this is an inherent problem with all of these types of DVD's? I am unable to do any type of navigating through this DVD with the fast forward or replay. That means I have to sit through several minutes in the beginning while Women's Health trys to sell me a subscription and then another DVD and basically this is same for entire DVD. I can't replay to review an exercise which I really would like to be able to.I think the workout is probably good, but this is something I am very frustrated with. Does anyone have any feedback on this or have an issue with? I would love to hear any suggestions. Thanks!"
2,Not for me,"I was really disappointed in this workout considering all the raving reviews. I lasted less than 5 minutes before I was turned it off in favor of an old standby.There was no warm up. The instructor and ""class"" are already marching when the program starts. The pace was way too fast - I felt like I was watching it in fast forward - no way could I keep up - and the pace was so fast you had no time to learn one movement before they were off on the next. If you are use to fast-paced aerobics classes or have had years of dance classes, this may be for you. I have been exercising (again) for about 6 months and this was way too advanced for me.I am much happier with Jillian Michaels 30-Day Shred or one of my ""Firm"" tapes. This one is headed for my Ebay sale pile."
5,Great workout!,I love this workout video. It's one of my favorites to rotate through. I'd say I am advanced as far as aerobics goes & this gives me a great workout-I am always drenched in sweat at the end of it. Amy Dixon is a fun instructor that is easy to follow. I have the Perfect Body Workout as well & like it equally as much.
5,Excellent!,"Women's Health Ultimate Fat Burn was excellent. I felt like I really burned calories. The routine was never boring and I got to do work on every part of my body. It was long enough without being too long and I feel like my heart rate was elevated for a good clip of time. The cuing was perhaps the *best* cuing I have ever seen on any DVD to date. No fumbling. No false steps. Amy Dixon was right on point, always remembering that I was seeing a mirror image of what she was doing. Ms. Dixon was also not patronizing, not annoying and just encouraging enough that when I wanted to stop a rep, I just kept going. I really sweated with this workout and I enjoyed it a lot. Highly recommended!!"
5,terrific,"I used this DVD for the first time today and was pleasantly surprised. I'm pretty uncoordinated, but I could very easily follow the moves and steps. Plus, the instructor was fun, cute, and normal...seemed like the type of person you'd want to have coffee or go on a hike with. I really liked the encouragement and motivation, which didn't feel false or anything. Even laughed a few times at some jokes! I also thought it was great that she reminds you that you are a strong, powerful, sexy woman, and you can do this!"
5,Fun and energizing!,"This was the first workout video that I purchased under the ""Women's Health"" series, and I was pleasantly surprised. The workout is fast-paced, yet easy to follow. The exercises are athletic, smooth, and easy-not dancy. I love Amy Dixon's instruction, she is motivating, easy to follow, and has a subtle sense of humor without being annoying. The workout goes quickly, and is the perfect length to feel energized enough to get on with your day."
3,One part was offensive to me.,"This is a great workout except for one provocative move that she does where she says, ""It's OK to get sexy"". I wanted to do this workout with my daughters. Now I'm going to have to find another one or else skip that part every time."
5,Never cheat yourself out of a good booty squeeze!,"Highly recommended. Amy Dixon is a fabulous trainer and the other ladies that are doing the workout with her do a great job as well. There is one lady that does the modifications as well. Amy is upbeat and energetic, but not in an annoying sort of way. She leads us through a warm up, cardio and strength segments followed up by a cool down."
1,No Challenge Whatsoever.,"Personally I think this workout is worthless - there is nothing difficult about it and I didn't even break a sweat. My mom tried this workout as well and said the same thing. While the instruction is fine and Amy Dixon is a decent instructor, if you're looking for a challenge, this isn't the DVD for you."
5,How to Fight Cancer & Win -- Saving Lives,"The book was purchased for a friend undergoing radiation for lymphnoma cancer in chest (following lung cancer surgery and chemo). She was not very excited that I brought home a book. Eventually, she opened the book and begin to read.The book has facts about cancer that she had never been told by her doctors. The natural resources, like wheatgrass, for healthy nutrition has made an enormous change in her body and how she has been able to handle the radiation. The doctor keeps asking her, ""Are you sure you don't hurt?"" Her answer is ""No, I feel fine""."
3,Curing Cancer,"A person doesn't know what to believe anymore. Everytime you have something wrong there are 100 people ready to tell you how to fix it and they all say something different. Sorry, I lost interest in the book BUT the service was fantastic."
2,Not that useful,"How to Fight Cancer & WinNice stories, some good recipes.Not useful for non-small cancer.I could have spent my time better than reading this book."
5,A must-have resource,If you or someone you care about is diagnosed...or if you have a family history of cancer - GET THIS BOOK. I got a copy for all my sisters as it was a godsend for us while my Dad fought Lymphoma. There is so much information in these pages that it should be one of the cancer oriented books you buy...actually this should be the FIRST cancer oriented book you buy.
4,How to Fight Cancer and Win,"This book has some valuable information about techniques for enhancing survival chances for cancer fighters. However! There are some questionable methods, and alternative treatments described which may or may not be helpful. Possibly I have not used a system fully or accurately, and should not speak to the effectiveness of these treatments, but my final reaction has been that there are no guarantees, that there are treatment centers which may just be taking the money of desperate people unable to give them the cure they seek. Each person must find the right help, choose the right treatments, and ultimately put their trust in God for the outcome. In other words, this is not the final answer, although there are many helpful ideas"
4,Like,"Good Book. Very helpful. Although I think I was looking for something more specific. But overall, a great place to start!"
3,I EXPECTED MORE HOV!!!,"AFTER HIS BRIEF RETIREMENT WE EXPECTED SO MUCH FROM HOVA, JAY, JIGGA, WHATEVER YOU CALLED HIM. BUT KINGDOM COME IS AVERAGE, THE LAST FEW YEARS JAY HAS BEEN LAZY IN HIS FLOW, DON'T GET ME WRONG THE BLACK ALBUM IS A CLASSIC, SO THE EXPECTATIONS OF A JAY-Z ALBUM ARE HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER RAPPER. ON THIS ALBUM ITS ABOUT 5 TRACKS THAT ARE HOT, THE FIRST 3, I MADE IT AND BEACH CHAIR WHICH TO ME IS THE HOTTEST TRACK ON THE ALBUM. THAT SONG WITH USHER AND PHARELL SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN MADE AND THE SONG WITH BEYONCE SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING OFF OF THE BDAY ALBUM. I'M SURE THIS ALBUM WILL SELL 3-4 MILLION COPIES AND GIVE JAY ANOTHER PLATINUM PLAQUE, BUT HIS TRUE FANS DESERVE BETTER, I HAVE ALL HIS CD'S AND BESIDES BLUEPRINT 2 THIS IS THE WORSE ONE. BUT HE DID COME BACK WITH A VENGANCE AFTER THAT WITH THE BLACK ALBUM SO MAYBE HIS NEXT ALBUM WILL BE A CLASSIC, YOU KNOW WE ARE EXPECTING IT TO BE ONE."
2,He could have done better,Jay-z could have done better. this album damn near SUCKS. I'm a big jay fan but I cannot get into it. the beats are horrible. out of 14 songs I really enjoy 3 i have listened to this album 3 times. i think if i listen to it about 3 more i will like more songs.
4,HOV is BACK!,"Well, he never really left, and it seems he didn't need the break. He's still on top of his game, breathing life back into a genre that's been on life support for too long. Jay keeps it interesting with an unexpected collaboration from Chris Martin on the song Beaches, which could have been a huge disaster. But if anyone can pull off a fusing of Coldplay's haunting instrumentals with hip hop lyrics it's Jay Z. (Don't forget how successful it was with lincoln park). There are also some less surprising, though equally enjoyable colabs from Pharrel Williams and Usher on the track Anything. This cd is nothing too outta the box, but a big declaration that hov is here to stay: reclaiming the thrown."
4,I doubted....Im Sorry,"i thought it sounded just like the black album at first. then i got to listen to it a little more throughly. I found myself amazed. i dont know why i doubted Jay-Z. He is the best there is and theres nothing else to it. This Album is wonderful. I like it. its proably the best album out right now. Its better than the ""most anticipated"" album to drop this year. Yes, im talking about Hell Hath No Fury. Sorry Clipse...the comeback isnt up to par. Sorry Jigga. I shouldnt have doubted. So im eatin my words right now. yeah im rockin out and feelin salty. Kingdom Come is well worth it"
3,Lackluster release from the self proclaimed K.O.N.Y,"I am not surprised that this is an average album by Jay because he pretty much gave everything he had left on the Black album. But instead of stopping like he promised he would, Jay felt he had more to say. The problem is it isn't anything different from what he has been saying for years. Talking about bling and how much money you have is soooooooooo old. Jay-Z is an intelligent person, I wish he would use some of his intelligence in his subject matter instead of rapping about things that don't matter. The very first song on the album has some ok lyrics and a dope beat. ""Show me what you got"" is one of the worst songs that I have heard in my life. It almost sounds as if it belongs on a K-Fed album. All in all, you may come across 5 songs (maybe!) that you would play in constant rotation. My verdict is: Buy this at your own risk."
2,descent....,"yeah it's not too bad... but if i wanted to hear a ""gangster"" get all mature, i would've purchased ice cube or ice tea... i love neptunes hits as much as the next guy, but i can't stand their stuff on here, let alone that HORRIBLE kanye west beat... i used to be a Jay Z hater, but blueprint and black album turned me... i love him now for what he does, but it's been how many months since this album was released? 6 or so? and i still don't feel 2/3rds of the album... i'm glad he's sold so much, but i'm also glad I downloaded it...jay's newly ""matured"" attitude, I don't mind,... i don't know why people criticise it, but when he combined it with uninspired lyrics and average beats, this is not the jay z album i've come to expect after black album...peace,"
2,COMEBACK,"i don't know what to say, comparing this album to The Games and Snoops it is GARBAGE. i'm being honest, or it might be because i never liked Jay-Z and who cares about HOVA he sholdn't have made this album."
5,Brooklyn's Finest,"It has been my great pleasure listening to Jay-Z of Hip-Hop. Kingdom Come has become a gratifying part of my life. The provocative from the songs in this album communicates with rather a ""zenith distance"" than the leading edges of his career. Can't really wait for the next album."
1,"Can't stay away, huh?","Why did this guy come back out of retirement? I thought that since this guy was coming back, that he would have something more to talk about than himself and how great he thinks he is. Jay, you have had your moment of fame, but how many more cds do you need to come out with to brag about yourself. The only songs here that are decent are ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""Minority Report"". The rest of the songs to me are garbage. Not worth coming out of retirement for."
1,too bad imus isnt a rapper,"not only would he still have his job,but hed have a lot of ''gangstas'' for fans.further proof that not only are rappers a disgrace,but hypocritical as well.rappers and their low life fans deserve each other.PEACE,SON...YA HURD ?"
1,Jigga what? Jagga Booo Leader of the No School,"Yo, you can't 'retire' from Hip Hop because it's not a business. Hip Hop is culture, and this Jay Z is not. The Jigga Man got on when Hip Hop was already dead yo! An MC is not the 'illest' cuz they sold mad units, in-fact the greatest MC's never really got Paid In Full. This is FAKE HIP HOP! The definition of WAKKK.Think about it."
2,Lay-Z,"Well, someone's outta touch with their fans. Jay, we really don't want to hear about your deals and how rich you are. Some of this stuff is like listening to Donald Trump, set to a beat."
2,Wackest Jay-Z album ever,Jay-Z put out this wack album and I hate it...I gave mine away because it was not worth keeping on my shelf...I think Jay-Z didn't put as much time and thought into this album...He sold strictly cause of his name and New York...
2,Sorry Jay...,"This is by far his worst album. He's great lyrically, but the beats do no match up at all. Sad that Jay left us with a classic, The Black Album, and comes back with this. The best track he's made this year is on the Nas album, Hip Hop Is Dead. What a shame though...I'm a big Jigga fan but this album was a letdown.To all the people who like this album, you are out of your mind...this isnt what Jigga's full potential is."
1,PLEASE RETIRE,"Hip Hop is dead. What does that mean? You know Run DMC thought the same about hip hop when 2pac and BIG ran the show. Its not dead its just changing. I look at what Jay and Nas doing is as wanting rappers to be like them. Well that aint happenin. Rappers have realized that when you be yourself and be comfortable with being yourself then thats when your career will take off. For example look at TI, Lil Wayne, Jeezy, The Game, 50 Cent(even though I dont care for his music), Jim Jones, and the garbage D4L type groups. These guys are successful because they do what works for them. Its kind of a major statement to say ""the game needs me"". No the game doesn't, you need the game Jay. My advise is go retire again, he is a much better business man than he is a rapper(can you believe that I once was a fan lol)."
2,Awful production squashed this one.,"I like Jay-Z, don't get me wrong. I think his rhymes are great, his ideas are always interesting. But this album is awful.As an audio engineer, I can hear that there are some interesting samples going on in these tracks, but when it comes down to it, the mix and mastering are what killed this record. The mix is terrible. I have a lot of respect for Dre, but I think this album proves that he needs to stick to beats and that mixing is just simply not his thing.Listen to the Black Album, then put this one in. The BA sounds really great, at least for a hip hop record, while this one is thin, overcompressed, and not even the bass hits you hard! You would think at least that would be right.Maybe the next time he retires we'll get a better record..."
2,JAY-Z IS SO OVERRATED,I LIKE JAY-Z BUT THIS IS BY FAR HIS WORST ALBUM. AFTER ALL THAT HYPE HE DROPPED A DUD
4,hip-hop is back,"It's not my favorite Jay-Z album, but it is one of the hottest CDs out right now compared to all the dirty south, candy beats, so called crunk hip-hop that's dominating the charts right now. I do have some fav's already on the album like, ""Oh my God"", but I'm always against a collab with a girlfriend. He should have left Beyonce to do her own thing. Overall, it's a good CD."
2,"remember ""the wizards""?","This album reminds me of jordans 2nd comeback. It's full of watered down commercial crap. If this is what he has to offer music wise, he should stick to his presidential duties. I could expect this kind of lackluster pop rap from some 18 yr old up & commer. Jay has already proven himself as a platinum selling artist, so ther was no reason for him to ""dumb"" down his lyrics & use ""cookie cutter"" beats. Even the dre tracks sound like subpar detox rejects. The only tracks worth a second listen are ""kingdom come"", ""do you wanna ride"", ""minority report"", & ""beach chair"". lets just hope nas can save us next month."
4,Kingdome Come- Jay-Z,"Jay-Z's return album. No album before this of his sold more copies in its first week than this one did (an amazing 680,000 copies). Professionals RapReviews, The Observer, The A.V. Club, The Guardian, and Rolling Stones gave ""Kingdome Come"" critical acclaim. Nice beats because of producers Just Blaze (Oh My God, the title track, Show Me What You Got), Dr. Dre (30 Something, Minority Report), and Swizz Beats (Dig a Hole). Another No. 1 album from Jay-Z. Get this CD."
5,Grown man rap...,"""Oh, this aint like his old stuff"". Really? So they're supposed to all rap about the same things regardless of the life they live at the time right? Great idea!! Then they can all be like Curtis and say how much they love smokin' and drinkin' when they don't even do it! That way they can keep the hip hop culture in the NWA days and never move the culture on to anything else! YES! Trash Jay when he gets thoughtful! Don't buy anything unless it's GANSTA! And outlaw Outkast, Lupe, Mos Def, Common, and Talib while your at it!How dare an accomplished rapper try to break the mold of what popular rap can be and make uplifting songs like Beach Chair!! But then again I'm white. What do I know about sarcasm?Make it rain!! Bump some thoughtful music like ""Na Na NaNa Na"" or ""Air Force Ones""! Keep it real like Game's back and forth bi-polar self! Or just bump 808s and Heartbreak and try not to feel like a retard...."
5,'show Me What Cha Got Jay Z!!!!!!,Am Really Feeling This Cd. Love ALL Of The Tracks. Jay Did His Thing With This One......H .O V.A. Gold Bottle With Ace Of Spade!!!!!!!
4,I Really Like This Guy,"First off, I had the bootleg for a while (I did buy it when it hit stores). I didn't pay much attention but then I took it on a road trip and really listened to it. Folks Jay is a grown man doing grown man things on Kingdom Come. If you want Reasonable Doubt go get that cd. This cd is great. When he said 30s the new 20, I was done."
3,mj on wizards,"This is a very very average album. Jay-z is just lazy as hell on this whole album, like he made this album while he was sleeping. He is all over the place with this, hes got songs like minority report and beach chair, 2 of the strong points of the album, but then hes got hollywood and anything, two songs that are possibly the worst of his career. He should have stayed retired, or at least focused before he came out with this. The production is mediocre, his delivery is horrendous, his flow is allright, but this album overall is a generous 3 star offering at best."
1,Abortion,"This is an abortion of an album. I'm merely writing this so that I can adjust the rating to what it really should be, which is about 3-3.5 stars. I don't want others to be deceived simply because it's Jay Z. Yes, he has put out some classics in ""Reasonable Doubt"" and others, but this album is one of his worst, if not the worst."
5,"I cannot stop listening to this fine, fine performance","The 2006 studio album by Jay-Z is one of the best releases of the past 3 years for me. I enjoy the artistry and flair that comes to the musical experience of his music but this album just touches you in ways that I do not think the previous ones do. Ups and downs and laughs and frowns this one is stupendous with a lot of heart. I hope he goes out on top or plays in some action hero movie, because I do not think it gets much better than this. Check out songs 1,2 and 6 they are my faves!"
3,What You Want Him To Do? He Said He Was Sorry...,"LOL! The intro to ""Show Me What You Got"" is funny when you consider how bad this whole album turned out to be."
1,"Most disappointing Jay-Z Album, worse than Dynasty","Not what I was looking for, nor expecting, from one of the greatest rappers of all time. This album is a disappointmnet when compared to his previous albums Reasonable Doubt and the Black Album. Hov proves he's the Mike Jordan of the game as he comes back from retirement pushing a 45 performance when everyone paid to see 23."
2,what happened jigga?,"IM GONNA START BY SAYING THIS! IM A BIG ""JAY-Z"" FAN IN ALL, BUT THIS ALBUM SUCKED BIG TIME! I UNDERSTAND THAT HE'S PAID NOW,AND HAVE A BEAUTIFUL GIRL ON HIS SIDE AND ALL, BUT I REALLY DON'T CARE TO HEAR ABOUT THE BEAUTIFUL LIFE HE LIVES NOW AND HE DON'T HALF TO PUT RIMS ON HIS CAR AND ALL THAT! MOST OF US DO DREAM ABOUT YOUR LIFE JIGGA,DON'T MASH IT IN OUR FACE! AND ""YEAH"" HE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT DRUGS AND GUNS NO MORE,BUT HE SHOULD OF JUST STAYED RETIRED! AND KEPT HIS TITLE AS THE M.JORDAN OF HIP HOP! BUT BEING AT HIS LEVEL OF HIP HOP, HE REALLY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT A QUALITY ALBUM, BECAUSE HE'S ALLREADY IS PAID, REGARDLESS IF HIS CD SOLD OR NOT! I PREFER TO HEAR THE ARTISTS THATS STRUGGLING TO GET TO THE TOP! ATLEAST YOU NO THEY ARE GIVING YOU THEIR BEST!"
3,The MJ of Rap....Complete with too many combacks.,"He calls himself the MJ of hip hop in his truly pretentious first single, and I have to agree with him. But this is not MJ circa minor league baseball. This is MJ the Washington Wizard. A move based on pure ego, narcissism, arrogance. MJ is now a phantom owner of the Charlotte Bobcats. Interesting parallel with Jay-Z, never known as a great talent evaluator, taking over Def Jam.Much like MJ, I can objectively view the entire scope of his Jay-Z's career and appreciate his contribution and mark on the game. Still, just like MJ, I look forward to the day where he just plays golf after his jumper goes flat.And Jay-Zs jumper on Kingdome Come is flat."
2,Garbage,"Can't stand that soft spoken BS style of rapping that these rappers are using nowadays. It sounds so corny and made for the ladies.KEEP HIP HOP AND R and B FAR APART FROM EACH OTHER!!!Jay-z hasn't been sh ! t since after his ""The Dynasty: Roc La Familia"" days."
3,Mediocre 'comeback' album,"BOTTOM LINE:He followed up the classic 'Black Album' with this??!Look, I'm a Jigga fan for LIFE, but this was painfully obvious as a 'rush it out to the stores' release. He basically told us AGAIN what we heard 10 yrs ago; that he's on top of the rap game. No track really stuck with me, and unlike most of his releases, I don't think I'll be quoting any lyrics years later. Probably his second worst solo release after Blueprint 2."
5,The Ruler's Back,"Come on y'all, its HOV the god MC. This album is instantly a classic. However, its very different and is not today's typical pop fade but real lyrical content. Kingdom Come has the potency of Reasonable Doubt and Blueprint laced in an upgraded hustler so evolved, showing growth and so in charge. He addressed his so called adversaries and lyrically assassinated them. Trouble, Dig a hole, Beach Chair. He's even got a political message in Minority Report. A couple of my personal favorites are: The Prelude, OMG, I made it, and Do you wanna ride; and are all straight classics. Its a wrap for these fake MCs, as he said in Kingdom Come ""just when you thought the whole world fell apart, I take off the blazer, loosen up the tie, step aside the booth, Superman is alive."""
1,Bull****,"We were playing cards over my best friends house and I heard this cd....Terrible,Terrible, Terrible. I respect Jay-Z because I think he is a great businessman but far from a great rapper. All he speaks about is BS (Crystal and such) and the sad part about it is our youth is buying it hook line an sinker. His formula of succes is put a mean beat together and talk about what he has and can buy. Lyrcially he was smashed by NAS and Eminem the later on his own album Blueprint and I would love to put a few others against and watch him die a slow death Common, Tali, Dead Prez, Dre 3000 (pre Speaker Box era) Don't get me wrong he has songs that I like but greatest Rapper...NOT!"
2,Did HOVA mention Myspace in a song??,"...Because i think he mentioned that he didn't have a myspace in a song. He's a bloody multi-platinum rap mogul! Is there nothing better to rap about than that how he doesn't use the internet?After a masterpiece like The Black Album, Kingdom Come seems trite and tired. I ripped the album from a friend, planning to buy it if i enjoyed it, but this album didn't last for two hours on my hard drive. Unlike HOVA's earlier productions, the beats in this album overpower the rapping...Oftentimes the tracks seem too busy, with crowded samples and fairly uninteresting beats behind Jay (Even Dre's!) Even when the beat isn't dominant and obnoxious, Jay's rhymes (although they are still better than most radio rap) just have no lasing value...this album is without a ""99 Problems"", ""Big Pimpin"", or ""Takeover""...I can't seem to remember a single hook or chorus.With any luck, this album will mark Jay's retirement. Kingdom Come is a major dip in the career of Jay-HOVA..."
1,"Yes, Kingdom of Incompetence comes ...with you !!! We know it !!!!","Dear Jay-Z,It's a great mistery of this earth how people shoud buy your albums !!!I don't have this album and I never will own it.For this rating I used the examle tracks of tha [...] and it is enough to say that THIS IS A FLOP LIKE ALL YOUR ALBUMS.I sincerely have to tell you that I appreciate you just and only when you are a guest in the albums of the other rappers . So be guest from here to your day of death.Fortunately there are rappers like Redman, Camp Lo, Icarus, Mally G, Da Ranjahz, Lord Tariq & Peter Gunz, M.O.P., Onyx and GangStarr that maintain high the banner of the rap music !!!JUST WITH YOU HIP HOP IS DEAD. This would be the title of your next album : "" Just with me Hip Hop is dead !"""
1,Awful,This is the worse Jay-Z cd by far. He's too in to himself to make music that other people would like!!
4,Mature,"This is a more mature Jay-Z, which is fine, but may be over the heads of his core audience. Doesn't have the same edge to it. I also not fond of all the R&B people singing over the tracks. But I do like topics discussed and the subtle jabs at all the new rappers in the game."
3,Leave well enough alone,Its okay....definitely not classic Jay. Most of the beats are lacking to say the least.
2,I've definately heard better...,"I have been an MxPx fan for years and I have to say that this is by far my least favorite cd by them. I thought the cd sounded over produced, and it didn't even have a slight punk rock sound. This cd was not pop punk, it was really just pop. If you are thinking about listening to MxPx for the first time, this is NOT the cd to start off with. If you want to hear them at thier best check out Slowly Going The Way Of The Buffalo, Life In General, or Panic. Really, I like all of thier cds minus this one."
5,Brilliant,"This is an amazing piece of music. Johnathan Rice's voice is beautiful and haunting, and his words resonate with a depth of meaning and poetic expression rarely found at all these days. I'm reminded a bit of early Bob Dylan and Cat Stevens, although his sound is completely his own. The raw, pure emotion is clearly felt in each song (""The Acrobat"" is particularly affecting), and the mocking spite in the anti-war song ""Put Me in Your Holy War"" is biting in its irony. All I can say is, I wish I hadn't missed him live here in Brooklyn, and I cannot wait to hear the full-length ""Trouble Is Real""..."
5,what john mayer would sound like if he was talented,"Johnathan Rice has the amazing capacity to write a pop (I know, I hate that word too) song that still somehow manages to come across as beautifully written and concise. Like his girlfriend, Jenny Lewis from Rilo Kiley, he can tell a story using a lyrical formula that makes the listener feel entirely captivated, as if you could be the one singing the songs. His gruff voice, nicotine stained and melodic, accents every song with a tinge of suffering and testoserone, which is highly needed when writing a lyrically driven song. Extended Player is one of the best EP's I've heard from anyone in a long time. He manages to show his full future-superstar self in a matter of a few songs. Ignore the O.C. Soundtrack if you're jaded against pop culture like I am, ignore the constant ElleGirl magazine's features of him as 'hottie of the month' or whatever and just sit back and enjoy a really good album."
1,Very over-rated,"This is very over-rated as being for us all. Sounds like a textbook. By the way, I've been a successful business-owner for over 30 years."
4,Koi Food,My three Koi and four goldfish love this food. It seems as though I am using it faster than I want to though but the fish really enjoy it and certainly like it better than some of the food I have tried.
2,Becoming the Elk Expert,"To the best of my knowledge, this book is a better choice thansome other items with which I am familiar. For example, I likethis book better than ""Elk and Elk Hunting : Your Practical Guideto Fundamentals and Fine Points,"" by Hartt Wixon, Hartt Wixom.Still, the author's approach is too narrow. The book leaves outmany interesting questions, which logically come to my mind when Ithink of elks and elk hunting. Specifically, strategy treatment isa weak point of the book.On the other hand, book has some attractive features, such ascertain aesthetic appeal and pleasantly surprising extensivecoverage of weapons & other arm related questions.Nevertheless, there are so many better ways to spend you time andmoney that you should carefully consider these other optionsbefore buying the book."
5,Waterford Bedding,"Waterford makes top quality, well styled bedding that lasts & lasts. We have several groups & love them all. Great product."
2,Great for Mystery Writers; So so for Thrillers,"This book covers writing for the genres of Mystery, Suspense, and Thriller.Mystery: I'd recommend this section to anyone writing a mystery. The mystery section is excellent and well done. It gives great examples, describes the genre elements necessary to a mystery, goes through various subgenres, and gives examples.Suspense/Thriller: Then I get to this section. Suspense and thriller are done together, with the focus on suspense. Where I got excellent examples of mysteries, for Thriller, I got ""once upon a time"" fairy tale stuff. Little was discussed about core elements of a thriller, no real examples given, and only a few subgenres were even mentioned--one of which, even at the time of this book's publication--is no longer selling well (techno). The section made me wonder if the author actually read any Thrillers.So for Mystery writers, it gets 3 stars; for Thrillers, I wouldn't recommend it."
3,Lost credibility on Page 25,"When I got to page 25, this book lost its credibility:""...We eavesdrop on Hitler and Roosevelt and Stalin as they discuss their forthcoming meeting at Yalta...""Say what? Hitler at Yalta?With that kind of historical blunder and/or lack of editorial review, I lost confidence in this book."
4,Provided some clarification,"I didn't exactly read this cover to cover, but it gave me a lot to think about when it comes to mystery and suspense and the differences between them. It contained some of the best explanation and examples of different genres that I've seen. I'm always on the lookout for some sort of definitive list of genres to use as categories on my blog, and this gave me a good place to start. It also helped me narrow down what exactly I'm trying to write. This was a good Kindle purchase, and I'm sure I will use it as a reference in years to come."
5,killer fiction indeed,"Great book, clear and to the point. Basic for all the people starting in writing seriously."
1,Only works for high quality pencils...,"The best thing I can say is that it's nice and heavy and has a large shavings compartment.Our kids get lots of pencils which have either poor quality wood or have ornamental covering on them which means you have some sort of thin plastic cover on the pencil instead of just paint.This pencil sharpener does not sharpen them very well. It either stalls out or struggles to give you a lopsided lead which you can barely write with.It works well for higher quality and more conventional pencils, though it does seem underpowered at times.The only consolation I have is that it was about ten bucks after rebate."
1,Skip this one!,"This sharpener is not worth the money. I just bought it today and after attempting to sharpen 3 different pencils decided to give up and return it to Staples. None of the pencils went into the sharpener smoothly, and the end result in two out of the three cases were pencils with sharpened wood but no point. The motor seemed to be struggling from the getgo. I should have read reviews ahead of time and just gone with a Panasonic. It would have saved me a trip to the store."
1,Terrible!,"Can't even give this one away! Had the same one for years (don't even remember the brand) but decided to get a new one because it seemed to be struggling to sharpen my pencils. I picked up what I thought would be a good one because of the brand and because it was at Staples. I thought I just didn't know how to use it at first because it ate my pencils! I tried to slow down my entry into the sharpening hole but the pencil would flop around and leave one side of wood. It sharpens REALLY sharp so that the point will break off. Maybe if I was a draftsman or something that might work but I only want a nice sharp pencil to make my grocery lists! I'm looking for something better on Amazon (should have gone to read the reviews there first!). Tried to give this away to some family members, some who are teachers, but after they saw how it works they said they'd rather use the old fashion crank type. Surely there's a better electric one out there. I know I had one. But I sent it to the Thrift Shop!"
1,don't get this near your pencils!,looking for another sharpener with the helio cutters and figured I'd pick this up for a second unit in the studio.motor shakes the unit so much that it breaks the lead.deep cutters yield points that are way too long when it does sharpen.trying to beat the lack of auto-stop functionality does not work ... it will keep on crudely chewing away.
1,"Wobbly sharpener, uneven points","Avoid this sharpener. The plastic mounts that hold the cutter shaft in place are too weak and flexible, and the cutter assembly is not well balanced. This allows the cutters to wobble inside the housing, which makes the sharpener cut unevenly. You get a point that is off-center, half exposed lead and half wood. You have to keep rotating your pencil and jabbing it in to even things out, grinding away half of it in the process. If you want to sharpen a pencil with an X-Acto product, I'd suggest one of their scalpel knives and a steady hand."
4,Great album,"This is a nice, casual album... as usual they don't take themselves too seriously and even leave some mess-ups in there. Great rendition of some of their classics... and even a cameo by Alanis Morissette!"
4,"An amusing and short book covering the ""fun"" of numbers.","Written for anyone with an interest in numbers, this booktalks about some of the ""neat"" things about numbers withoutrequiring more than high school mathematical knowledge. Topics covered include prime number, geometric numbers, repeated fractions, and other chestnuts in mathematical recreations. This book is written at precisely the right level to interest a wide range of readers. For college mathematics students, a higher level book, such as ""Fundamentals of Number Theory"" by Leveque would be recommended as a primer to the theory of numbers."
2,Not too difficult...,"...but I could not tell how current this reprint edition of a 1966 book is.This short volume is filled with curiosities about numbers and their theory, but the explanations are sometimes dense, and I was left wondering in places, Exactly why is this topic important to number theory?Oh, well, good for a summer afternoon..."
3,O.K.,"This is one of the Dover Math Series which is `flawed'. Some of this series are really nice while others are, as this one, abrupt, written [generally by Englishmen] using words not common to a U.S. vocabulary.This book was originally published in 1966 by the Oxford Press. Brit maths notation is just `off' enough if, as me, you are not `into' it proofs are spoilt until the uncommon words are deciphered.Maybe you recall in Alice in Wonderland the poem `... little Bat / how I wonder where your at'.--- `Bat' was a math prof at Oxford whose lectures and proofs were unaccustomed. Its not the maths which is Batty here but the nomenclature, the notation and the abruptness."
5,Item as described. Thanks,"Great chips for smoking. Give all a great flavor. I have used these before when my brother-in-law lived in New Mexico, he would send them to me. Great to find a new source since he doesn't live out west anymore."
3,"Cute, but....","Great quotes and extra info in this book, but the recipes are very basic. I would have preferred more authentic ethnic ingredients and recipes, or just more up to date uses of flavors and enhancements. Soup section really should have a lot more choices (in my opinion), but my main issue is that the ingredients in the recipes are just very basic."
3,Not for guys,"I came across this series as a Tolkien/C.S. Lewis fan looking for more Christian sci fi or fantasy. Tyers writes fairly well, and her approach to Christian thought is original, but the book focuses more on the relationship between the two main characters than on the kind of broad-scoped world building that I was looking for. In short, this is a romance."
5,Wish they'd make this series into a movie,I loved reading this series when it first came out and I always look for more Tyers books because of this.
2,Be Wary! This is a Religious Re-Write of the Original Sci-Fi,"I very much enjoyed the original 1987 mass-market version of Firebird and the later Fusion Fire, then published by Bantom Books Spectra. I purchased the Firebird Trilogy published by Bethany House believing it to include the same earlier editions along with the long awaited third volume and snatched it up. However, I am disappointed with the new religious version. I liked the strong Firebird from before, but now she is recast into a weaker, less focused, less driven woman whom I find less interesting.This new version is not bad, but definitely not what I was expecting. I don't know if this was a marketing ploy, but usually when an author re-writes ('improves') a book, it is a selling point and thus emphasized on the cover (new and improved, author's preferred edition, etc). It is interesting that it wasn't labelled so in this case.Know what you are buying!"
2,I got lost,I was lost from the beginning.All the outer space terminology was too much.I like a book that can catch me from the start and this book definately had me frustated 10 chapter into it. The book was huge. It was three books within one book.
3,Good Effort,"This is a good attempt to show the effects that depression can have on a person and her family. While perhaps not always like this, each person's illness is different in its manifestations. This society is sorely lacking in understanding that folks who suffer from depression are not able to just push themselves through it. It doesn't work that way. Although the acting was average, it was a lot better than many films I've seen lately."
1,Unsure of content,I removed the dvd helen from my wishlist because there wasn't enough info on it as it didn't have a rating and that is very important to me to know the rating before I buy.
4,A MUST READ,"This is an absolutely indespensible book for those of us who are really into rock and roll. The chapters on Creation, Love, Hampton Grease Band and a few others make this a necessary purchase. I do agree with some pundits who note that there are some artists included who are hardly `unknown'...and apparently there are no Canadian `unknown legends'...but those are very minor quibbles. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of time!,"This sharpener is horrible! it would be quicker to just use a dollar store hand sharpener as it will sharpen better and faster. This does do a great job of breaking the tips as soon as you think that your pencil is almost done. All in all, it takes about 45 minutes to sharpen a box of pencils due to its poor speed. Ive owned it for 6 months and I am completely disappointed X-Acto would put out such a product. I wouldn't even call it a product, its just a piece of plastic that breaks pencils. Stay away from it!"
1,Forget it,"I bought one 3 days ago and returned it today. When I received it, I took it out of its box, plugged in and put a pencil in. It made a very high pitched whirring sound, shaved the end of the pencil for about 5 seconds and stopped sharpening. The sound continued, I took out the pencil and was surprised to see that it had undulations on its end. I tried with another pencil, same sound, no sharpening at all. Packed and returned the next day. Thanks to Amazon for making this very efficient and painless."
2,never buy this sharpener,when i boght this sharper i was excited because i had lots of dull pencels to sharpen .so i started to sharpen .when i went to do my homwork with sharp pencels two seconds later it broke .i still have it and i am goingto get a better one. you also have to swist the pencel to get it sharpend .its a pain.and i can never find a sharp pencel to write with .And when you empty the sharpenings it all spills out of the garbage.it never sharpens pencels.so i have started to use macanical penceles .But they aways brake.I recamend to never by this sharpener!!!!!!:(
3,pretty good,"This product is pretty good, i've had better, but i needed one and it was cheat and it also it is pretty good quality too"
1,BAD DEAL,"I have purchased four (4) of these sharpeners in the past two years, no easy feat on a teacher's salary. Only the latest, bought a few months ago, is operational.Despite a 8-10 year warranty claim, these products all quit in my classroom after less than one year. I have contacted the company several times. No response. In a futile attempt to have the sharpeners repaired or replaced, my students wrote letters to the company. They company ignored their 3rd grade letters. My school services poor, inner-city children. Through their indifference, Elmers Inc. has managed to make the childrens' lives even more difficult.This ""unfriendly"" business approach on the part of Elmers is reproachable. Beware of the false advertising and callous business practices."
1,Broke after 3 days,Wow this thing only lasted for 3 days before it decided to quit. My 3rd graders used it for maybe a total of 15 times and it got stuck to where it wouldn't shut off even after the pencil was taken out. Now it won't even sharpen the pencils. A great way to start the school year.
2,Disappointing,"I have one of these in my middle school classroom. It sharpens, but it is noisy, and it does not sharpen very well. Leads are frequently broken, it jams, and the noise will drive you up the wall. Most of my students prefer to use the old time crank sharpener, or the little hand held ones."
1,Awful Sharpener,"Despite being advertised as being heavy duty, reliable, and good for classrooms, this sharperner is definitely not any of those things. I've tried this product twice in the last several years and both times have been disappointed. Xacto sharpeners are the worst. I've tried other models in my classroom since they seem to have cornered the market with their cheapness. Their sharpeners grind down the pencils without sharpening them, wasting time and money. They're noisy, slow, and ineffective. The blades aren't sharp enough and the motors are too weak."
1,Beyond HORRIBLE! I really wish that there was a negative rating available for this item!,What a waste of money. I was on my second sharpener after only three weeks. The second one lasted 1 month. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
1,Stopped working after 4 months,"I am a teacher and need to sharpen a few hundred pencils every month. The Xacto is supposed to be able to do this. I don't even let my students sharpen pencils anymore. I bring pencils home every week and sharpen them myself to make my sharpener last. After 2 months, this Xacto started sharpening unevenly regardless of the quality of pencil and then it started squealing and wouldn't sharpen very well. I bought this in Sept and by Dec it has totally stopped working. Warranty expired. Xacto in the trash. I'm better off getting the $18 sharpener at Sam's that lasts half a year. I paid $59 for the Xacto! They don't make an electric sharpener that will stand up to classroom use. I've tried them all now."
3,Boston Pro Pencil Sharpener,"I had previously owned this same model which was brand new and loved it. The peg on the tray had broken off, so I had to replace it. I thought that I was replacing it with a brand new one, however, when I received this one it was not. It still had pencil shaving in it, along with a big scratch on the unit itself. I think that the advertising was very misleading! It should have clearly stated that a used piece of merchandise was being purchased."
5,It does the trick!,"X-Acto School Pro Heavy-Duty Electric Sharpener (1670)I like this sharpener with its choice of pencil width, its clear shavings well, and its ability to give a good point. I would definitely recommend it for almost any artistic or office use... I did purchase this from Amazon."
4,Great Sharpener,"I am a teacher, and needed a new sharpener after my manual one for my class room busted. I used this sharpener many times, and it did very well. It stopped sharpening right when it was perfect. I have a student, and whenever she sharpens her pencils, she pushes so hard, it jams the sharpener. She keeps it in a jammed position for periods of time. It seems as if she finds the sound of the motor struggling entertaining. She many times made it overheat. She recently burned the motor out, I am not sure what happend to the thermal protection. This is truly a great sharpener, although I can't tell you how long it will last, so I will only give it 4 stars"
4,"Quieter than most, fast and even, big recepticle, perhaps awkward size/look for some","X-Acto School ProI prefer the Bostitch Quiet Pro 6. This one isabout as quiet and they appear to do a similarlyquick and even job, but I like the look of theBostitch Quiet Pro 6 more and it does seem I canfeel the sharpening job is done more easily withthe Bostitch.That said, it seems to be a fine electric sharpener.If you are okay with its look and size it seems todo an excellent, relatively quiet job.I can't speak for its durability as I returned itafter comparing with the Bostitch. These were thetwo available at Office Depot that advertised theirquietness.Pros- Much quieter than most electric pencil sharpeners- Big shavings receptacle- Fast, even sharpeningCons- Nothing that wasn't personal taste/feel."
3,Good heavy duty electric pencil sharpener!,This X-Acto Pro heavy duty electric sharpener works very well. It has a large receptacle and is less noisy than the usual electric sharpener. It has multiple diameter dial fits for various pencil sizes. it also comes with a Manufacturer's 2-year warranty. This sharpener makes a terrific gift!
2,Didn't last long,"Got the sharpener right after Christmas. It did well for a couple of months in the classroom, then wouldn't sharpen anything, although it still turned. This was my second try. I won't invest in one again."
2,Only works sometimes on some pencils,"The weekend before the first day of school I start to sharpen pencils for my students. I TRIED to sharpen about half a dozen and got disgusted because I couldn't get one to sharpen so that wood wasn't covering one side of the point. I ground them down to half their length to see if I could figure out why this particular brand does this. We bought a truck load of these for our school last year and Special Ed got one for each teacher. I trashed 2 of them within 2 weeks, 1 for for this same reason and the other because the motor quit. I don't know what act of faith get me to buy another one, it won't happen again. The Bostwich I replaced it with works really, really well, including sharpening the pencils this one wouldn't."
1,"Poor Quality, Over Priced","The X-Acto School Pro sharpener is expensive and the quality is sub-standard. This company should be ashamed of themselves for advertising this sharpener as a heavy duty machine for high usage in schools, when in fact, the quality is worse than hand held sharpeners. It should be recalled and removed from shelves and on-line purchasing."
1,Not school worthy,I used this pencil sharpener in my 5th grade cassroom. I never let my students use the sharpener and sharpened all the pencils myself since i had gone through several sharpeners in the past several years. i spent a great deal of my school budget on this item and by January it was no longer working. As a teacher i need reliable products -- this is advertised as classroom use but it did not live up to it's promise. It would be great for someone that is not using it comstantly
1,"Hunt Manufacturing / Boston School Pro Electric Pencil Sharpener, Blue Gray / HUN1670",I wasted $40 on this sharpener. It worked for 2 months and I didn't allow students to use it. I sharpened all student pencils. I was also unable to get recourse on the 2 year warranty.I was very disappointed.
1,Not at all what it's cracked up to be.,"I bought one of these for my 5th grade classroom. It worked for the first year because I sharpened all pencils and treated it with kid gloves. It worked, but the sharpening was not symmetrical and usually required another try because the lead was not exposed all round the pencil. At the beginning of the next year, I decided to allow the students to use it. Within a month, it no longer worked. Finding no suitable alternative, I purchased another. For three months, it performed as poorly as the first one originally had, then broke down completely. It does not live up to the manufacturer's claims. In other words, look elsewhere for a good heavy-duty electric pencil sharpener."
2,Works great for 3 months,"I was so happy when I got this pencil sharpener. I looked high and low for a sharpener with a quiet motor and high volume capacity. I did not want my classroom disturbed by the constant sound of the sharpener. When the sharpener arrived it was super quiet and sharpened well. That was three months ago. Three months of classroom use has turned this sharpener into a loud, slow operating sharpener. Depending on the pencil, some students have to stand and sharpen for over a MINUTE!! I have decided to purchase a cheaper electric and also purchase about ten of the cheap hand held plastic sharpeners. I would caution anyone considering dropping fifty dollars of their own money on this sharpener. I regret it."
2,Works well...at first.,"Rarely do I write reviews for products, but I wanted to make sure that all the other teachers out there steer clear of this sharpener. I am on X-acto School Pro Sharpener #3 in three years, and it is the same story every year. Works great out of the box but after a few months(really...months!?!) of everyday use it's production starts to decline rapidly. The sharpener sharpens off-center and will often break the lead. This is not a good product and not worth the noise and headache it will cause in a classroom."
1,Pish pot of a sharpener,"My wife is a first grade teacher and we bought this sharpener because of the claim it is for teachers, and I respect the brand. HA!! Too funny. This sharpener is poorly designed with plastic gears at an angle that causes the shavings to get packed into them. That is why it sharpens off center all the time. It is always getting jammed. I have taken it apart several times to diagnose and repair it for my wife. Why don't they make metal gears at a down angle from them? We will be looking for a better sharpener!"
2,Should have listened to the reviews!,I am a preschool teacher and we use the large beginner pencils which are hard to find a good sharpener for. I was hoping the reviews were wrong but within 2 weeks the sharpener started only sharpening one side and now it does a really bad job all around. Bummer.
5,great for teachers and classroom,After struggling for years with manual and electric pencil sharpeners I have found one that works well and is sturdy enough for constant use by teens.
2,Great until the motor stops,"I'm a teacher, so keep that in mind. I've had a few of these, but all of them broke down after about 6 months. Tons of use though."
2,Not very good,I am a volunteer at a local elementary school. We offer to sharpen pencils for teachers and have the Hunt Corporation model 167X pencil sharpener (brand name Boston School Pro) to do the job. It doesn't keep up with the job. After a while it overheats and shuts down. It often clogs with graphite and must be disassembled to remove the piece of graphite. Very inconvenient. Unfortunately we haven't found a better pencil sharpener at any price. Does any one know of a better one?
3,Classroom Use,"I am not to thrill with this sharpener. It will not work sometimes. I have 52 students and it is pertinent that I have a good pencil sharpener. I wanted to send it back, but I was overwhelm with work, etc. So, I believe it is to late to send back."
1,TERRIBLE......,I am an art teacher. I have had two of these and neither lasted longer than 3-4 months. I would not recommend it to anybody.
1,Poor performing sharpener,"I used this at home for my kids to sharpen graphite pencils (no color pencils). After several months it does not sharpen well. The blade never cuts evenly all around. I regret buying this product. I have purchased xacto blades and cutters before, no problem. This product is a dud. So disappointed. I now have to find another sharpener. Should have read the reviews on this one first. My mistake. I will never buy xacto again! No value for you money."
1,Voltage,"Can't rate the quality yet. Even though I have done thorough research with all suppliers and on Elmers website, there was no indication that it only works with 120Volts and therefor wouldn't work in countries that use 220Volts or other. Now I'll have to sort something to get a voltage converter/transformer to enable me to use it. Still packaged, warranty card completed and ready to post.Reply from Elmers after I have sent them an email regarding no indication of voltage on website:This is unfortunate. We have requested Amazon put a notation on the page that outlines this product. I suggest you ask Amazon for some type of resolution outside of the normal return policy with an explanation of the electrical challenge.RegardsPaulX-Acto School Pro Heavy-Duty Electric Sharpener (1670)"
2,cheap plastic basket broken; sharpener unusable !,"The plastic basket which ""catches"" the pencil shavings has a safety mechanism to prevent the sharpener from operating without the basket.WHEN (not if) the cheap plastic basket breaks, the sharpener is unusable. And x-acto sells only replacement cutters, not baskets!!I'm returning to an old-fashioned hand-powered sharpener in my classroom."
1,doesn't hold up,"I have been through three of these now and I am completely done. The only reason I got the last one was because the store offered a replacement insurance for an extra five bucks. When the sharpener wore out after 3 months, the store said the manufacturer's warranty (2 year) took precedence. Their process of replacement is not worth the time, and do I really want another one anyway???My first grade teaching partner has had the exact same experience with these. We sharpen a lot of pencils every day in first grade, and these don't last."
1,Teachers - don't buy this!,"I have bought two of these for my classroom in the past 2 years. They break, they chew through pencils (esp the office max/office depot kind, which are cheapest, we know!), and they don't stop when the pencil is sharp, so kids just keep jamming the pencils in! The multiple holes for different sizes seemed nice, but kids turn it and then try to sharpen a standards size pencil with the largest hole and end up breaking chunks of pencil off in the grinder. Plus, the standard size office max/office depot brand pencils don't fit very well in the hole that's marked ""Standard.""It's expensive and you'll have to get a new one every year. Teachers, don't get this one!"
1,Piece of trash,"If teachers created this they did a very poor job. I bought this pencil sharpener and it did not make it through the school year. As my son would say, ""this is an expensive piece of trash."" I am wery disappointed."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I am on my third sharpener. I returned 2 after each failed after just a few months. The third one is now junk. The plastic gears cannot hold up to classroom use, and the blades go dull very fast. BUY ANOTHER BRAND OF SHARPENER"
1,Doesn't hold up in a classroom,I have owned 3 of these units in 4 years. I teach school and I've been disappointed by this product. They keep burning out on me and my students. I would not waste my money.
1,A pencil sharpener that doesn't sharpen pencils...,"I was tired of having my students sharpen with the little handhelp sharpeners, so I spent my own money to buy this for my classroom. What a waste. It half-worked for about 2 months, then it simply stopped sharpening pencils altogether. The motor runs fine, but it seems like I can't push the pencil in far enough to have it sharpen. I have cleaned it many times trying to discover if there's something stuck inside, but no. It's free of obstructions. It just doesn't work.So...we're back to the little handheld sharpeners, except I'm poorer.Teachers, save your money."
4,The Teacher Sharpener,"The reason I call it the teacher sharpener is that I believe it is the teacher that needs to do the sharpening. This may not be has practical for you, but it's what I decided after my fifth graders continued to jam and burnout my other sharpeners. I decided I would treat my new and expensive sharpener gentler than my kids. I sharpened at the beginning of class and it lasted the school year. It got dull at the end and it did make a funny noise. I just cleaned it good by blowing air ( I have a compressor) and a little oil for the noise. It worked until the end; it is still dull and would like to replace the blades if I could. But I reiterate, don't let the students jam it. Watch them and you'll see what I'm talking about."
1,Very Disappointed Teacher,"Only buy this pencil sharpener if you want to replace it each year. The sharpener worked very well until the end of the school year and then the blades became dull and would not sharpen the pencils. Hunt Company replaced the blades under warranty. Now that the warranty has expired, they refuse to replace the blades and won't sell the blade replacements. What a shame that electric pencil sharpeners are supposed to be disposable!"
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this sharpener after reviewing several others. I am a second grade school teacher and needed something that would hold up under fairly heavy use. This sounded like the ideal sharpener...but I was wrong. This sharpener started out pretty good. It sharpened quickly, smoothly and with nice points. In just a couple of months, it has become noisy, vibrates as it sharpens, often sharpens off center (as described by the previous review), and pencil points are much less sharp when it does sharpen correctly. It has a warranty. I'm going to call for a replacement. I'll let you know what customer service is like."
1,Great while it lasts!,"While it worked, this was a great sharpener. The problem is that it only worked for three months. RIP OFF! Don't advertise that it's for school use unless it will last at least one school year. I have a much lower quality model that is going on its third year in my classroom, and it advertises for office use. The jokes on me!"
1,"Poor quality, doesn't last, no service after the sale",I'm a middle school teacher and bought two of these on the advice of a colleague. Both broke down before the end of the year. So did the two my colleague bought. It turned out she hadn't used one before but was taken by the imposing hero shot of the sharpener.The company was completely unresponsive to the several phone messages I left.A hand sharpener works better in the long run. Don't waste your money.
1,Not for second graders,"My 6th sharpener of this model in 3 years completely broke down Friday. I am searching for a better one. Initially the sharpener worked well, but after a month of use it became more noisy and chewed up pencils, especially brand new pencils. This was not a good option for us. If you sharpen few pencils this may work well for you."
4,Very good for home use,I purchased this unit in 2009. It has been working great. I am thinking buying another as a donation to school.
1,Nope,I have had 2 of these for 3 years. they BREAK pencil leads. My students have to go back and try again at least 50% of the time.
2,Broke Down after 8 Months,Bought this less than a year ago and it broke down. Used it at home for my two kids who used it for doing their homework. Disappointing. Definitely not heavy duty.
3,X-Acto electric pencil sharpener,I bought this Xacto sharperner for my kids and it was way too big and noisy. I did not like it so much.
5,Best pencil sharpener!!!!!,I dont undesrstand how this sharpnener got 3 stars i bought this in 2008 and its still working like new. DEFINETLY BUY IT!!!
2,Works - Shortly,"It will work for a year then you will need to replace it. I only buy X-Acto sharpeners for my classroom, but this isn't one of them. The X-Acto Pro is the best. I think the LED light for the kids is what will keep it lasting."
3,Not always accurate.,"Several of the pictures do not match the firearm listed. Incomplete discriptions, it apparently wasn't proof-read."
4,I saw this in Houston,"I saw this performed live in Houston while the kinks were being worked out of the performance for Broadway. It is a wonderful and moving musical. This cd is great, however I am looking forward to the ""true"" Broadway recording versus some of the popular artists on this cd."
5,A masterpiece!,"This CD was wonderful! The music, the performers, everything was perfect and diverse for just about anyone"
4,"An Exceptional and ""Feeling"" Piece of Work","Although this is not the ""traditional"" music we are used to hearing it is a wonderful modern presentation of the thoughts and feelings that we as Living Historians work so hard to impress on the general public in the many encampments nation wide. I was ever so moved by the closing anthem and found myself in tears. Those of us who FEEL this History and have come to understand it's devestating horror and loss, appreciate the effort and thought put into this music and lyrics...ask those of us who portry this subject...not the critics...they can't possibly relate to the subject...their tuxedos are on too tight! This work should be judged by those of us who wear wool and layers of petticoats! Blue or Grey."
2,Not a good thing to buy if you're a Wildhorn fan...,"I bought this concept album of Wildhorn's latest Broadway show (OBCR as yet unreleased) and it really let me down. Though some of the songs are performed well, and there is a fantastic song (""I Never Knew His Name"") performed by Wildhorn's wife, Linda Eder, I wouldn't really recommend buying this album if you want a true picture of what the show is like -- wait for the original Broadway cast recording!!!!"
2,wildhorn fans beware,"I bought this because I thoroughly enjoy Frank Wildhorn's work. It is somewhat true to what one would expect from the creator of The Scarlet Pimpernel and Jekyl and Hyde but mostly it is a completely independent experience. My biggest complaint was that I am not a country music fan and Civil War is full of it. All in all I would say this is a stirring, unique and surprising oratorio from Frank Wildhorn who shows some greater depth in research yet lesser depth in composition."
2,Please tour the country again!!!!,I saw the play in Pgh. several yrs. ago and bought both cds. I wish EVERY American could see this show and learn about the Unbelieveable sacrifice of war. Pray for peace!
1,Songs organized around a theme do not a musical make,"Pretty songs, beautifully sung. But there's no narrative, no progression, no climax. Frank Wildhorn writes great pop tunes, but not musicals. Wish he'd give himself a crash course on dramatic structure -- hole up and watch and LISTEN to the musicals of Rodgers & Hammerstein and Lerner & Loewe and Frank Loesser and gain an understanding that a song should take a character to the next level. It's a nice album, though -- easy listening. But doesn't give you those chills down the spine that a great original cast recording of a truly great musical PLAY will."
1,"Very, very disappointing....",I honestly thought that Frank Wildhorn could do much better (after Jekyll & Hyde etc.). I expected something much more of something with such a moving theme. All this 'musical' is is a bunch of pop stars singing (and I use the term losely) some less than average songs.
1,What album have you been listening?,"The album I heard heard contained bad rock, phony gospel and banal lyrics. Wildhorn could write decent songs if he took a contemporary setting. They didnt sing rock in the nineteenth century. He also should reread his junior high history book to get a better perspective on the war. It wasn't only to free the slaves!The show opened and closed immediately- I can see why!"
1,No wonder the Brits dominate musical theater,"The problem with this show and its accompanying recording is not its lack of narrative sructure - many a brilliant piece of theater has thrived by shedding the conventions of traditional storytelling (Cabaret, Sunday in the Park with George, Company). The problem, quite frankly, is that Wildhorn's compositions are banal and not the least bit challenging. We could forgive such Superbowl half-time show nonsense as 'By the Sword' if it dealt with love and loss in a college dormitory; as an anthem about a potent passage of American history, it's a flat-out joke.Could the man have devised a less subtle approach? Could his music more closely resemble a rejected segment from the 'America Sings' ride at Disneyland?Could I be more disappointed with the state of American musical theater? Save us, Sondheim; save us."
1,Frank Wildhorn is the master of cliche.,"The works of Frank Wildhorn are absolutely awful. Think of a corny cliche, and Frank Wildhorn will have it in his lyrics. The music is also cliched. It all sounds the same. Why buy the soundtrack to The Civil War when you can get Jekyll and Hyde or The Scarlet Pimpernel for less money? Do NOT get this soundtrack. It is a waste of time and money."
5,"The war, sat to music in the 19th Century, is resurrected","The haunting sounds recorded on this album have given the men and women of the age, Northern and Southern, a voice with which to sing. While the melodic stories being told are not always an accurate interpretation of the war, they fill the listener with emotion and adoration for those who, as ""I'll Never Pass This Way Again"" says, came to say ""I will die for what I believe."" A relevant history!"
5,"It was the most moving, powerful and beautiful music.",I heard the commercial for the Broadway show and was so moved by the powerful music that I tried to locate the soundtrack. I was not successful but was able to purchase a CD with some of the original songs which were pretty but were not the same as the Broadway soundtrack. The woman who sang the Freedom song really belted it out and it was so moving. That song she sang gave me goosebumps and I had to have THAT CD. I would normally leave the room during a commercial but when I heard that particular song I would rush back into the living room to hear it.
5,Moving Moments,"Taking a serious subject like the US Civil War and turning it into a musical was a giant leap of faith. Turning the most pivotal element of our history into entertainment could have been a disaster. Instead the lyrics and music bring to life the extreme trauma and hardships caused by this major event in our history.When you consider that in a country (in 1856) with a total population of 30 million people, the deaths on both sides, North and South (All Americans) numbered over 650,000. This would be the equivalent today of over 6 million deaths in a war. I doubt if our country could ever be willing to make this level of sacrifice for whatever cause in the future. It is a sobering thought and we should all be thankful for the sacrifices made by an entire generation."
5,"awesome, full of feeling, a wonderful experience","Saw the National Touring Company production in Providence, bought the CD during intermission, listened for a day and bought tickets to two more performances. The play brought tears to my eyes everytime, the mood it set was inspiring and reverant. I brought my daughters, girls with no concept of what the Civil War did to our country and they left with not only with an understanding but a true compassion for the tradgedy this war brought to our nation, When I listen to the CD I still get goosebumps. I love the music, the only way it could have been improved upon was if Larry Gatlin had recorded the Southern Captain's songs. He,along with the entire cast of the touring company was incomperable"
5,Best Music in a Musical since Les Miserables,"I was given this CD as a gift, and I wasn't expecting much, but it was track after track of WONDERFUL hummable tunes, wonderfully performed. I only wonder if the stage show can possibly be as good as this CD."
4,Great reference book,"The book contains some great projects that concern examples of high-density housing. The texts are short and to the points, accompanied by good photographs and drawings (plans/details).As for the book itself, the paper-wrapped cover can damage quickly and the book could use some more projects considering it's price tag. Still, This edition (as with the entire In Detail series) is very much recommended for architecture students and architects looking for good books that show interesting projects in drawing and detail."
3,Nice but doesn't last long,"I bought these highlighters for my wife who is in law school. She used one of the highlighters up in less than a week. Most highlighters last her a month or two. These are nice, but they don't last."
2,Bleeds through the paper too easily,"Found an old accent liquid highlighter in my drawer at work and instantly fell in love. That was apparently before Sharpie acquired the company that used to make the accent, because the only option now is this skinny version with a fine point tip that bleeds through pages very easily. The one I found was fatter, with a softer tip that laid down smooth highlighting that did not bleed through. Wish I could find more of the old version."
4,A great highlighter,"I love this highlighter and it is the only one that I like to use. The color is bright, doesn't fade, and it not messy. The only drawback is it runs dry fairly quickly. I use these for school and use about one per chapter and a half. Granted I do highlight a lot but still I wish they lasted longer. If you buy these in store you will pay a lot more so make sure to buy them from Amazon which has the lowest price."
3,Good highlighter but short life,"The highlighter itself is well made. The look of it is great and it really provides a nice gliding feel compared to other highlighters. I have used a great deal of highlighters and the sharpie liquid is much more vibrant and smooth than the traditional pocket accent highlighters and similar. However, the liquid ink is emptied out fairly quickly. I suggest getting the dry ink ones if money is an issue because the difference is not enough to justify the price."
2,"Decent Highlighter, But It Drains Fast","This is a highlighter that has a liquid reservoir, a distinct improvement over ones that utilize a wick type arrangement. While it marks well enough, the liquid drains out quickly, about three times as fast as competitive reservoir markers. Given its high price, you're going to spend a lot for a little.A better (and cheaper) highlighter, if you can find it, is the Binney & Smith inkTank Desk Highlighter Chisel Tip."
3,Good Highlighters; Annoying Cap Issues,"I really like these highlighters. Unlike other highlighters, when these die, you have some warning-- you can plan ahead-- because you can see when the ink is low. They are sufficiently bright and they don't bleed through most pages. My only issue with them is that if you take the cap off and put it on the non-highlighter end of the highlighter, sometimes the end gets stuck in the cap when you're try to re-cap the highlighter. If it gets permanently stuck, you are out of a highlighter possibly way before you expected. Now, you can always mitigate this problem by just not putting the cap on the other end of the highlighter but I put the cap on the other side of the highlighter out of habit as I imagine lots of other people do as well. Other than that small issue, these get the job done."
5,"Do their job perfect, but dry out quick.","With that being said, I knew it from reading previous reviews, I bought them for the feel and the quality. They are not bulky and fit in normal pen slots in my backpack."
5,Better than I expected,"I like orange highlighters because they don't fade to nothing like yellow ones, but don't overwhelm text like red or blue ones. I have used the Bic orange highlighters and like them, but I think these Sharpie Accent ones are a little smoother and seem to last longer. The caps are very secure on these highlighters, almost too tight, but they assure they don't dry out. I will definitely order these highlighters again."
4,"Excellent highlighter, but ink runs out quickly","And, if you happen to leave the cap off, the tip dries out quickly and it is very difficult to get it wet again.Still, I would choose a liquid highlighter over the old felt tips any day of the week, because you know how much ink you have left."
4,Sharpie Review,The merchandise was very good. I was a bit dismayed at the shipping time (I took the free shipping) -- I had no idea that the norm was 3-4 weeks if one qualifies for and selects free shipping.
5,I've met the author,I bought my copy of this book from George himself while on a fishing trip to George's son John's place in Canada. I bought one of the first copies after it was published and George was gracious enough to autograph it for me. Reading this book is a lot like listening to him in person reminisce about his extensive experience in the Canadian bush.
5,Jack London comes alive,"I have always been a Jack London fan. However, every one of his stories has long since been read and reread by me and millions of others out there. Now, we have something new to hold onto, even if it is for just a short time. Thank you Gary and Tom for giving me Jack London once again. Perhaps one of you could sign the book for me sometime. What a pleasure. Thank you for intriguing mind-blowing stories. Jack grabs you once again and throws you, (not takes you,) into the very heart of the story."
1,Plastic=easy break,I have bought numerous plastic versions...and none of them have lasted more than a month...and cold weather...forget about it...you will be lucky if they don't break the first time using them.
5,These guys are my companions through law school,"I LOVE THESE HIGHLIGHTERS, i've bought like 6-7 boxes in 3 years of law school. Like other reviews say they are that that florescent yellow. But, i dun need florescent, florescent distracts me from lots of text, yes there is emphasis, but its so strong that it overshadows what its suppose to modify, Berol Yellow is a solid bright Yellow, not dark, not florescent.Stop by your school bookstore they charge you 3$ for 1 highlighter. !*$#*$!# seriously wtf, already charging 50 grand a year gimme a break."
4,Real Yellow Highligher,"This Highlighter is not the bright yellow that most Highlighter have (see yellow lid). I would think it is somewhat noticable when making copies. Note also, that this highligher is not as big as the usual barrel-size highlighters and therefore lasts for a shorter time. The tip gets a little soft after using it for a while. Nonetheless, for bargain prize, it is a nice, german-made, very smooth, and real yellow highligher I enjoy using as much as all the other good highlighers."
4,Good highlighters.,"12-packs of highlighters mean that it doesn't matter when they run out, you can just grab another. But trust me, they run out. I found these drying up a little sooner than I would have hoped. I still like them."
4,Great Highlighter for the Price,"For the price, it is ridiculous good when you look at other brands with less amount of highlighters. I relatively smooth when you highlight and comes with a chisel tip. Even though it is not stated anti-smear or has smear-gaurd like Sharpie, it doesn't smear my writing or documents. The only issue that I have with this type of highlighter is that it is not bright as I want it to be. Other highlighters are bright and yellow while these are more yellow to orange mixed. Holding the highlighter feels the same as other tank-highlighters.PROS+ Economical on your pocket+ Doesn't smear+ Comfortable+ Comes in pack of 12+ Chisel tip+ Cap stays put and doesn't fall offCONS- Color (not bright enough)"
1,"Sent me the wrong highlighters, not as shown!","I ordered these from Amazon themselves, sent me a box (all torn open) that were a totally different cheapo brand called Berol. Not the EF's I ordered. They are horrible. Ugly color. Perhaps if I have gotten the corect EF highlighters I would have liked them."
1,False advertising,After purchasing Bissell quicksteamer we found out that quicksteamer was not a steamer. The name Quicksteamer is a common name used in the industry.We used this product once & it did not suck up the water on our tile floors. It did not clean floors as promised & was not a steamer. We promptly sent this over rated product back for a full refund! Very disappointing!
2,Started smoldering,"I loved the machine and it worked great until today as I was using it it started smoldering and smoke started coming out so unfortunately I am now without a machine . Unfortunately the return policy is only for a month . I guess I got my use out of it I used it about 6 times , just frustrating to think it was going to work and now without it ."
1,Very Poor Performance and Quality,"Avoid this one! We bought the Bissell Quicksteamer Multisurface 2090 a year or so ago because several sources had given it a good rating. They were wrong! It did just an average job on both carpets and hard surfaces (tile floors). More disappointing was the quality of workmanship. We only used it occassionally, and tried to follow all instructions, however it literally fell apart while my wife was using it. The various plastic clips, attachements, etc. would regularly come off while in use. Even though it only received light usage, the motor got hot enough to melt the plastic motor mounts rendering the front rotating brush useless. Eventually, the motor literally went up in smoke. It is sitting at the curb as we speak waiting for the trash men to pick it up in the morning."
5,Great,This is a great multi-surface cleaner for a super price! It was the only one I found that did carpets and hard floors for this price. All you have to do is change the cleaning head that snaps on and off. It stores easily in my closet--not too bulky.
2,misleading,"This product does not produce steam for cleaning. You can't even use boiling water in it. Its name infers that it does steam cleaning, but it definitely does not.On bare floors, the bare floor attachment pad wears out on doing a single kitchen floor just once.On carpets, it can only do about a 4 foot square section of carpet per load of warm water. Its ability to suck up the water is fair and the carpet needs almost a day to completely air dry."
4,Good littel cleaner,This was only carpet steamer I could get to ship to Hawaii for free .. We live in a small townhose and found that it clean very well and was easy to use and clean
4,Easy...Easy...Easy!,"Everything about this was easy-from assembly to cleaning the unit after use. Lightweight and easy to carry, one fill of the cleanser mix does more carpet than one might expect. IF you like the convenience of an at-home carpet cleaner, try this!"
4,Excellent for quick cleaning,"I have two cats and white carpet - TheBissell QuickSteamer Multi-Surface Upright Deep Cleaner, 2090is an excellent machine for quick cleaning. If you have cats you know what a fur ball looks like and the type of mess they can make. With a passage or two my carpets looked beautiful.I like the easy assembly and the quick prep for use."
5,Already paid for itself,"This is an inexpensive but solidly built machine. It does a nicer job than rental machines and is more compact to get into more spaces. One tank might just finish an entire room, but you should expect to go through two tanks on the average. The concentrated cleaner lasts a good while. As for the steam in steamcleaner, not even the rental machines produce real steam and I'm not sure you'd actually want actual steam to touch your carpets and wood floors. After doing a great job on the carpet, I used the hard floor attachment in the kitchen. This machine does a far superior job than a mop and bucket. It cleans better than a mop, it's less messy, less work, and the floor dries in a fraction of the time."
4,is actually good product,"Light weigt, excelent for smaller non-commercial jobs. Easy to do a small room, and cleans tile as well as carpet. Our 1 st Bissell was too awkward, and big to handle-glad they made this size--excellent price (Amazon was the best)"
4,It works,"This Bissell works well and is lightweight enough to be easy to maneuver on various surfaces. Very efficient water extraction, carpets and rugs are quasi-dry after cleaning. This carpet cleaner is slightly cumbersome to clean after having used it, but it's a minor inconvenience. All in all a good device."
3,Should have done better research.,This product works great for what it does. However to call this a quicksteamer is a lie on bissells part. This unit does not steam. You put hot water in it and thats what it puts on the floor. No steam is ever generated or released. I was suprized at how small the cleaning head is on this machine. It takes extra time to cover all the area. Maybe I expected a head like a sweeper vac. The price was great. And it works well.
1,Very disappointing results,"This product doesn't do the job, no suction to suck up dirty water, worked once (barely) a month later doesn't work at all. Difficult to move around tight spaces. Somebody was asleep on the job when this was designed"
1,"HATE IT,DO NOT BUY THIS","DONT BUY THIS, THE DIRT COMES ALL OUT, STOPS WORKING AFTER WEEKS... HORRIBLE, NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY!"
5,5 stars,I felt this was an amazing book that influenced me in so many ways. I would recommend to single or dating and every one in between. I fell this book has taught me how to approach things differntly and in a Godly way when it comes to dating in my life.
1,Misleading Quality,"The posting said the book was ""like-new"". When I received the book, there were highlights and underlines in over 50% of the pagers. Very disappointing."
5,STEPPING STONE TO CHANGE,When I first read this book I was in college and honestly thought I knew what dating was. I actually hesitated to read this book because I just thought it would be judgmental and there would be an ounce of truth that would convict me of my dating life as a Christian. Today I can say I have no regrets but now I have standards and expectation. Love this book and this author!
1,Only appropriate for high school students or younger,"This book is only appropriate for high school students who are probably too young to be dating in the first place. Unfortunately, many well-meaning 20 somethings have tried to implement Harris' backward approach to dating and its resulted in young adults who don't have good relationship skills. The best way to get to know another person is on a one-on-one date. Women don't respect 25 year old men who ask them on group dates or try and pretend that a visit to a coffee shop- where she pays for her own beverage- counts as a real date. Dating isn't sinful. People are sinful when they take advantage of each other."
3,Good for what it is.,"I came across this book by accident in a used bookstore fairly recently. I read it in a few days and was surprised at this young man's insight into the world of dating. Although I do not agree with many things Joshua Harris writes about in his book, I do think he brings up some very important issues.Read with caution and make sure to keep an open mind as no other views or opinions are offered in this book, which reads like a collection of sermons."
3,Just another way of dating,"No matter which way you spin it, Mr. Harris' idea of courting is just a more traditional way of dating. Are you interviewing this person for marriage or what? Now, it may not be the ""world's way"" of doing things, but its still dating nonetheless. Sorry to burst anyone's bubble. Its just a safer, more responsible way to see if the person you are dating is the person you will marry. The ideas and customs purported in this book are biblical and responsible- I'm not making any statement as to his suggestions... I just want to say that courting IS dating. I take real issue with people who suggest that Christians who ""date"" in the ""worldly"" sense are somewhat less spiritual then those who ""court"". I tend more toward a ""courtship"" view of dating, but lets call it what it is, ok?"
1,"Wrong premise, wrong conclusion","Harris seems to have a great heart and passion in this book. Unfortunately, when one writes from a wrong foundation of both biblical and personal contexts, one always arrives at the wrong conclusion. Biblically, Harris butchers texts...personally, he had bad dating experiences, thus dating is bad. Dating - this is a word...courtship - this is a word. Between these two, is there a more godly word? He says courtship. Chapter and verse for support? None. Let God's perspective on relationships be our basis and not someone who is speaking from the context of bad dating experiences. For a great read, get ""I gave Dating a Chance"" by Jeremy Clark. Thankfully, for santification, Harris has grown. His new book ""Not even a hint"" is worth the read."
4,Singles should definately read!,I love the book and think that overall the idea of changing how you think about dating is great. I will admit that some of the views are a little extreme but he does say that every idea is not for everyone. I believe anyone that is singe with a desire to oneday marry should read the book because you will get something out of it.
1,Wonder why there is an epidemic of single Christians in their late 20s? Look no further.,"This book is not only bad, it's destructive. I read it as a teenager and bought into it's message hook, line, and sinker. Now here I am, 25 years old and just learning how to pursue a woman for a relationship. This book has created an environment in churches where men literally try to figure out if they want to marry a woman before they ask them out to dinner or even coffee. Women in churches are frustrated because they never get asked out by Christian men who are searching for a spouse before they even spend two hours alone with a woman and find out more about her one-on-one. I sympathize with the female reviewer that said this book ruined her life. It is THAT BAD. Do yourself a favor and don't read it. Having sex before marriage is clearly sinful, but the implication that it is wrong to go to dinner with someone of the opposite sex with the intention of getting to know them better is absurdity at its finest."
5,I Kissed Dating Goodbye - Josh Harris,"I Kissed Dating Goodbye is not a book that says you shouldn't have friendships with girl and it is not a book consisting of a bunch of rules. I Kissed Dating Goodbye is about holding off on romance, until you are ready to make the commitment for marriage. I found this book to be useful and inspirational, not just for the topic of relationships, but because Harris teaches you things that you will need for life, regardless of Marriage. Harris teaches you about and points you in the directions of making smart money investments and choices, learning how to fix and change things around the house, and how to treat women with honor, starting with those you are related to. Overall I Kissed Dating Goodbye is an incredible book and I highly recommend it.I received this book free from the publisher and am not required to write a positive review."
2,There must be a better way,"Does god really wants what Josh states in his book, that every human must be afraid of feelings his entire youth, and suddenly he or she will know how to act just because of God's grace.God is good, that is a fact, but that doesn't take aside the fact that the everyday experience gives us very valuable lessons, and we must not hide from it, or run from it, but to learn from it.There is no sense in trying to hide the feelings or constrain them.Embrace them, and listen to God, not some guy who thinks is right."
2,I don't know....,"This book scared me. Experience truly is the best teacher. Just because one man felt that this was what God wanted him to do, doesn't mean that everyone should do it. This stuff can brianwash you, please think for yourself always. A lot of what this book says will make sense to you, but that doesn't make it right. Dating is a part of life, and getting hurt strengthens us all! Please be careful, everyone."
5,Encouraging,Don't be thrown off by the title. Mr. Harris gives some great advice for those with a desire to see relationships from a godly standpoint.
5,I kissed dating goodbye,Wonderful book for anyone who is single. I shared it with my friends and the too are buzzing about it.
2,Horribly useless.,"I actually remember reading this in high school when i fooled myself into thinking that i was going to forever be one of those good Christian boys and this girl who I was interested in told me to read this and the other book that encourages dating in Christianity. It was mildly comedic. Horribly useless. I hate books that try to tell you directly how to change your life. I encourage people who are trying to fool themselves to read this, it will reinforce your ridiculousness."
4,Good but not great,"Joshua Harris did a wonderful job with this book, but I don't really think i will follow it. He did a great job in saying that we need to date when we are looking for the ""right one"", but yet it seems pretty hard. I know we have to put everything in God's hands because he is the one thats in-charge. He knows whats best for us, but i'm still young and i'm not ready to settle down so I still believe in dating but just not to the extreme."
5,I Kissed Dating Goodbye,I love this book we had to read this for Vacation Bible School. The whole class really enjoyed it.
1,Totally off kilter,"I borrowed a copy of this book from my Pastor. Mr. Harris is totally off base. His rather overt suggestions (if not out-right statements)that dating is anti-christian is laughable to the extreme. I consider myself a good christian and have met the woman of my dreams by dating.Mr. Harris, in my belief, has some strong issues with women. I suggest he truly put his hands in our lord and talk to a faith based counselor as soon as possible."
1,Unrealistic,"I think the title of my review says it all. Although ideally this is how it all should happen, ideally there is also no illness, sadness, tribulations, etc., you get the picture. I read this when I was much much younger and thought it was fantastic. After 10 plus years have past I have a very different point of view. I believe Pastor Harris needs to take responsibility for the advice that he gives out. Quite simply, it's books like these which impede Christian relationships from ever starting. Relying on the message of this book some have kissed dating goodbye before they ever really started. I say you should give dating a fair chance and then decide for yourself. While I'm sure Pastor Harris has every good intention, wisdom might be lacking in his failure to clarify that this route may be for some, but certainly not for all ""good"" Christians."
2,Not A Fan . . .,"Joshua Harris has some interesting things to say about dating and relationships. The background he is coming from is credible and he has obviously had some great experience with his theory. But I think it is very extreme and would be hard to implement in normal life; furthermore, I believe that the goal of his theory on dating (honoring God in relationships, forming a foundation for healthy and holy marriages) can be attained through other, less drastic methods. But it is an interesting read and it might be helpful to understand his point of view."
3,A necessary evil,We now hit the slow issues of JLA.The middle issues of the series running from about 74 to about issue 90 featured some of the worst stories of the series. This volume hits at the begining of that slow period.There are a few notable stories such in terms of historic events in the JLA timeline but the only reason why I'll be buying this issue and the one that follow it is to keep the run intact for when the good stuff starts returning.If you don't have any of these books yet DONT start with this one.
2,Christmas Songs,"I was under the impression this was ""THE"" soundtract...not just some various artists songs...not happy at all."
2,NOT THE SOUNDTRACK - misleading!!!,I bought this thinking that it was the soundtrack for the movie. It is a collection of songs from the movie sung my country singing stars. The cover is almost the same one used to represent the movie and I feel very ripped off! I'll give it to my daughter since I have no use for it and she enjoys country music.Also it is currently going for half the price I paid for it. sooooo frustrating
2,Inconsistent,Med student here. We take our highlighters seriously. I had these highlighters before and they were fine - dried reasonably fast and didn't bleed. I ordered a new pack and these ones bleed all over the place. One of them was even literally dripping highlighter fluid off the tip. Unacceptable.
4,Closer to Fine,"I use highlighters for editing paper drafts of documents. Lots of documents. I like the BIC Brite Liner for its chisled tip, which allows highlighting a narrow line of text in a single-spaced document. The bright colors assure that tagged text is not overlooked in review. I love the retractable tips; no caps to misplace or come loose. My only gripe is, they do bleed a bit through 20 lb. copy paper, which makes them inconvenient for marking up documents that are printed back to back."
4,Dull,"These highlighters work fine, but they seem kind of dull. I thought they would be bright and stick out but they really don't. They work, I'm just picky about a lot of things."
4,Fun for dressup!,I ordered this to go with a Poison Ivy costume for Halloween and it was a great hit. Everyone told me I should seriously consider becoming a red head.
5,Excellent,"For all Kennedy lovers, this book is fantastic. There are a lot of never before seen pictures of Jack and Jackie and the rest of the clan. Very intresting information on each wedding. A definite must have if you collect anything Kennedy."
5,Kennedy Family,Such a fascinating family and this book is no less fascinating. What money can buy and some surprises sucha as sisters sharing wedding frock.
4,Great for the price,"It's great for my son to have a cordless pencil sharpener. He's had good experience with it not breaking off tips. The downside is that it is very loud, and also you have to really push the pencil down fairly hard. But for the price we are very happy with it."
2,Takes too long,I had a lot of pencils to sharpen and thought this would do the trick. I expect it takes 15 mon a pencil. I went and got a Boston Xacto plug in which is very speedy.
3,Misleading Title,"I bought this because I was excited about the prospect of a yoga routine targeted specifically to the core. However, this is just a basic intro to vinyasas and while it claims to have beginning, intermediate, and advanced postures, the camera rarely ever focuses on the girl doing the advanced forms so how can we follow it? I recommend this DVD to those who want to learn basic yoga postures but not to those already well-versed in yoga. It will frustrate you as she focuses on the beginners, dragging out the routine and slowing me down without offering the option to focus on the advanced. I am giving this to a friend who is new to yoga. I prefer Sara Ivanhoe's 20 Min Yoga Makeover: Flat Abs for a good core workout."
5,One of the best I currently have in inventory,"I bought this dvd a couple of months ago because I love yoga but I also have a belly! This is one of the best workouts I do! Between Pilates and this belly yoga I and can see and FEEL a difference. If you are new to yoga this dvd will teach you the basics... this dvd is very relaxing and your body will feel wonderful. I never buy a workout dvd that is going to take any longer than 45 minutes, this one comes in segments but if you do the whole series it wont be any longer than 45 minutes. Actually Prevention has some of the best work outs in the industry as far as I am concerned."
3,Better Belly?,"I think the name is deceiving. While the stretches are great as is the instruction, there's WAY too much of it. Some of my pet peeves with this video are:Too MUCH time spent on instruction;Too much repetition;Too much focus on arms and legs and not enough on core;Actually BOTHERED my lower back vs. relaxing itI can't see how this would strengthen your core. While I realize I have a pretty strong core and a pretty strong, flat lower stomach, even if I didn't I don't see how this would build those muscles. Maybe I'm missing something. I wouldn't say don't try it, but if you are looking for something closer to a miracle than doing nothing at all, this won't do it."
1,Total Ripoff!!,"Buy something else. Total waste of money of $15.00 for a 36 minute video of stretches you can learn from any where or a more detailed workout video. It's nothing but strectching, Complete waste of money!!"
3,Grinding at the Mill,"There are a number of virtues in this book -- particularly the re-iterated point that Blake occupies a complicated position between the liberal radicals of the 1790s and the conservatives of the same era, due in large part to his saturatiion in apocalyptic religion and his artisanal heritage. The discussion on time in the context of the Industrial Revolution is also interesting. But the whole book is far, far too long, and makes a number of dubious points in order to further the author's academic agenda (the chapter on Romantic imperialism, derived from the author's earlier book, is interesting on other people than Blake, but is hardly convincing on Blake). There are the usual faddish references to Deleuze, etc., of no real import here.The interested reader on Blake should go back to ""Prophet Against Empire""; -- more facts, less interpretation."
3,Good Enough,"I thought these earrings would be bigger, but they are pretty tiny in diameter. They don't shine as much as I thought they would either. Also, they say these are sterling silver, but my ears still get infected if I wear them too many days in a row. The good thing is they are easy to get in and out for every day wear."
2,"Worked OK for a year, then died","We chose this sharpener because we thought it could handle the pencils of five kids, and for about a year it was mostly fine. It choked on those annoying plastic-covered pencils, so we taught the kids to remove the plastic before sharpening. It sharpened unevenly after the first month or two. It got slower and louder gradually until it finally just stopped spinning entirely. Exploratory disassembly showed no obvious problems, so probably the motor failed. To the dump it goes, and we'll have to find something new that teachers rate well. Maybe we'll just go back to the manual sharpeners..."
1,Aweful,For the first 3 weeks this sharpener is wonderful but then.... this goes downhill really fast. To think I wasted money on two of these before realizing it was such a systemic problem. Stay away.
2,Powerhouse sharpener loses strength,"I used this pencil sharpener in my classroom, roughly about 65 kids use it throughout the day. It was good for about 4 months. It was quick and sharp. After that, it started sharpening one side of the pencil. Funny thing is that it only did it on certain pencils. Certain Staples and Office Depot brand pencils don't work that well with this. Others work fine, very tempramental machine. I had another Exacto that I bought before this one that still works fine. This one now works when it feels like it. May need a new blade but I just got whole new sharpener. Slightly dissappointing for an Exacto."
2,Ditto,Another teacher still looking for a pencil sharpener that will last more than a couple of months. This ain't it either.
1,BIG disappointment,"Like many other purchasers, I am a teacher. I bought this for my classroom. It died after 3 months. My husband dissected it and discovered a piece is missing - and one of the gears is PLASTIC, so it was guaranteed to fail. I'm just ticked that I get $2/per child for art supplies for the whole year and this took up the allocation for 16 students."
1,Doesn't Last,"I'm a Math teacher. Had this for about 4-5 months and the motor died suddenly. We averaged about 5-8 pencils a day. If this is heavy duty, it should have been able to take on the job. Total waste of my own money."
1,no good,"i bought this sharpener for my classroom 2 months ago. after the first month it started ""knocking"" around as if it was off balanced. I took it apart and cleaned it out. It kept knocking. It only sharpens one side of the pencil so all pencils are lop-sided. The sharpener literally rocks when you use it. Today I had it. I took the thing home and took it apart. I cleaned every single part of it. I put it back together and the knocking and rocking continues. I'm so annoyed. My co-teacher has a Panasonic KP-310. AWESOME sharpener. I'd go with that one. I'm calling the manufacturer tomorrow to see if they'll replace this one. They say there is a 2 year warranty."
5,it's about Amazon.......,"Once again, the product was great, the customer service is great, but I must credit Amazon for governing all the sales and overlooking great customer service. I realize that many sellers here are just great but Amazon as I said, overlooks everyone and keeps it that way and I'm sure all sellers feel the same way. <N>"
1,Piece of JUNK,"Like many reviewers of this product, I am also a teacher. The sharpener in my classroom is only used a few times a day (probably about 3 to 4). This sharpener worked fine for about 3 months, but now sounds like a scraping metal and sharpens crooked. It is completely worthless."
1,SHOULD HAVE LISTENED!!!,"Yep! Should've listened to what the others wrote in their reviews. I said, ""no, I saw this sharpener in my son's classroom and it worked amazing! These people must have gotten lemons."" Well, I must have gotten a lemon too. The sharpener worked great for 2 months. Now when I try to sharpen a pencil, the sharpener sounds like a goose with her foot trapped in a snare!!!! What a piece of Chinese crap! IF YOU WANT A SHARPENER THAT WILL LAST FOR MORE THAN 2 MONTHS, DO NOT BUY THIS SHARPENER!!!"
1,Too many plastic parts,"I inherited this pencil sharpener from another teacher. I initially found it to be great. Certainly much better than the other electric pencil sharpener that many other teachers at my school have. But it stopped working recently. I thought it was jammed so I brought it home in order to take it apart and fix it. What I found was the central part that rotates was broken. Why? Because it is made of plastic. Several other internal parts are plastic as well. This machine is designed to break. It lasted for one school year, which is pretty good for a relatively cheap sharpener. But after 5 years you will wish you had spent at least $100 and purchased one that was built to last."
2,"Cons: Very Loud, Small Receptacle","X-Acto Powerhouse Electric Pencil SharpenerPros:- Good looking for a power sharpener- Not overly big- Tough, with a lot of use by kids still going strong after over a yearCons:- Super loud compared to several other quieter pencil sharpeners- Receptacle fairly small. Unless you like wood shavings spills, when it gets full, bring sharpener to basket to clean out.- No strong hint that it is done sharpening like I've felt in some other sharpeners."
1,tried two,"I ordered this sharpener for my middle school choir classroom. It worked great... for about 3 days. Then it broke. I assumed it was a fluke or not used properly, so I returned it and ordered the same one as a replacement. The second one made it 2 days and it was used carefully. I don't have time to continue trying these out so I sent it back for a refund and had the old-fashioned crank one put in my classroom. It works great."
2,worked well for 2 months,I ama kindergarten teacher and bought this for my classroom. I am the only one who sharpens pencils in my classroom. I thought it would be good and last a long time. After 2 months of usage it only sharpend one side of a pencil so you have to twist the pencil while sharpening then after 4 months of use it has started getting louder. I am very unhappy with this product.
1,Very disappointed,"I am a 1st grade teacher. I bought this sharpener from Amazon in August this year. I was so excited. I had one exactly like it the year before and it was wonderful! By the end of the year, my 1st one started making a knocking noise and did not sharpen or only sharpened on one side. Hey, a year in 1st grade, that's great! We sharpen a lot of pencils. I had purchased my 1st one at a discount store. When I went to purchase another, they no longer carried it. You can imagine my excitement when I found it on Amazon! I quickly purchased it and put it in my classroom. By the end of September this sharpener was making that same knocking noise as my first one did after a year of use! I only sharpen the pencils in my room, and I only do #2 wooden pencils. I even purchased one for my teaching friend. Hers died in October. Needless to say....super disappointed in this sharpener! I did not have my packing slip so I felt like I could not contact Amazon or do anything about it! :("
1,Very Poor Quality Sharpener,"I'm an art teacher and our school purchased these sharpeners for us at the beginning of the year. Very poor quality. It worked well for about a month; it then began to get really loud and fail to sharpen the pencils. Also, I don't let the kids use my electric sharpener, so I don't believe this was from over use or user error. Just a poor quality sharpener, not worth the money."
2,"""Powerhouse""???","I am a third grade teacher and splurged with my own money on the X-Acto 1792 Powerhouse Pencil Sharpener because it specifically said it would withstand heavy use. This sharpener worked like a dream for 6 months, and then started making a screeching noise when we tried to sharpen pencils, and now it won't work at all. I have tried contacting X-Acto through email and phone trying to get my sharpener fixed or replaced, but have had no luck yet. I don't know if the situation will be resolved, but I'm not happy. Oh yeah, and don't even bother going with the School Pro. That thing broke after a couple of months. Don't pencil sharpener people know kids need to sharpen pencils every day at school?"
1,This thing is CRAP,After only a couple of months this stopped working. It still spins but just chops the pencils up. I went with this model thinking I would have a sharpener that lasted. So disappointed.
4,Great highlighters and $$ is right,"These are great highlighters, especially for the money and being there are a dozen in the box. HOWEVER they DO bleed through copy-weight paper, notebook paper and thinner book pages, but not horribly. It is enough to bother me a bit though, so gotta lose a star. The tip is chiseled to you can highlight thick, thin or underline, so 3 different line widths depending on how you hold it so thats nice. The only other thing that bugs me is you can't snap on the cap - you can sort of sit it on the end of the pen but soon as you tilt your hand the cap ends up rolling around on the floor - but still a great product that does what its supposed to."
1,Dried out!,"I really like these highlighters and I ordered a box in every color, but this box of Orange highlighters contained 12 highlighters all of which are partially dried out. I didn't bother returning them because they are so cheap and they still work but the color is off and they run out incredibly faster than the other colors so it's disappointing."
2,Not very impressed,These highlighters bleed right through the page. The square tip makes it hard to highlight precisely. They are more like coloring markers than highlighters. I really don't like these highlighters.
1,Don't buy this tool,"I bought this tool for home use after many years in the trades and a lot of positive experience with Hitachi tools. After less than 500 staples the depth adjustment screw stopped functioning and I'm now stuck in ""max"" depth. Trying to get warranty service from Hitachi (although they were very friendly) would have cost me more in time and trouble than the cost of the tool. I'm going to buy a different brand."
3,Good gun,This is an all around good gun. Not the best of the best but it does a great job. I own a few others of diff brands but this one is the loudest. It does not have a belt hook but easily added on. Nice and light.
1,Drives all staples too deep,"This stapler drove all staples under the surface. The depth adjuster is not designed correctly and will not hold the stapler far enough away from the material. If you always want to drive 1/16th under the surface, this is a good stapler. But, if you want to drive just flush or just to the surface, you will have to put a spacer under the foot. I tried another Hitachi, and it had the same defect. I bought the Porter Cable and it works flawlessly. Amazon refunded all of my money including return shipping. I find it very rare to get a better deal than Amazon anywhere on the 'net."
5,Good stapler for the money,"After buying and wearing out 3 chinese staplers I bought one of these, and after 10,000 staples it still works like new!"
4,"Hitachi N3804AB3 1 1/2"" 18-Gauge Narrow Crown Finish Stapler","I am replacing my Senco 11 oiless stapler. I have had it sence 1989. I had it rebuilt 7 yrs. ago. It needs to be rebuilt again. I disided to get the Hitachi because I purchased the 2"" brad shooter a cupple of years ago and it had all the features of senco plus a FIVE year warranty. No other company has this that I know of and the stapler works great. I am a carpenter by trade. You can't go wrong with this gun."
4,Did the job,replaced the spindle on my mower deck with ease! Straight forward to use and a great price too boot. thanks
5,The Alpine Path,The Alpine Path by L M Montgomery is interesting but only superficial. She was asked by a magazine to write the story of her career but she was not at all willing to tell things about her private life to the magazine readers so she wrote this book - it was originally published in a magazine. The facts are correct but there is so much left out by her. To really understand her life and find out all the interesting bits she left out of The Alpine Path you need to read her Journals (1 to 5) as these are quite fascinating and really tell her story. At the time she wrote the Alpine Path it would have caused a scandal if she had told the whole truth. I recommend the Journals to anyone interested in the real life of Maud Montgomery. They are wonderful.Marjorie Lockwood
1,BASIC HAIRCUTTING/STYLING KENNETH OF LONDON,I am actually quite disappointed with this video for a number of reasons.It doesn't really give you much help considering it's a training video. It only discusses one style and the style is very dated (70's) It's very short and the camera didn't show the important things that it needs to show. The shipping charge is too high compared to the actual amount charged to me. I will not recommend this video at all as a training video for what it describes on the internet.
1,"Good art, very bad format... the book breaks apart",A lot of pages detached from the book after very short time and very gentle use.You can find the good artists than appear in this book on other books that come in a better format.Mark Ryden art appears only in the cover...
1,Don't judge a book by its cover,"The only good thing about this book is its cover which shows a Mark Ryden's amazing work. On the other hand, inside of it, there is nothing interesting. The art shown has nothing to do with Ryden's and its really inferior.When the book arrived, I opened it feeling very curious to see what was inside, but it really got me disappointed. In addition,whitin less than one day, it dismantled completely due to the very poor binding. I almost gave it back to Amazon. Instead, I gave the book to my maid for her to play with collage art with her little daughter."
4,The $50 discount on the A+ exam makes it worth the price!,"All in all, this is a good product. The description is certainly out of date, but the material in the product does cover everything needed to pass the A+ test. I was disappointed in one aspect of the product. The documentation that comes with the product states that there are Chapter Quizzes that one can take before starting the Reading Assignments, as a pre-assesment. But in speaking with Technical Support for the product, this feature was not implemented in the final release."
5,very nice,"These screens are very nice. Mine were so warped and sticky, they were driving me crazy. I did a search online for replacement screens and checked out Amazon's list. Condar (the company) emailed me right away after I placed the order to notify me of them being shipped, the arrived w/in a few days and installed great and fit great. I would definately buy from them again."
2,Ok but...,"I tried switching to this product from the Aveeno Clear complexion foaming cleanser because it is cheaper. It worked well to get rid of my acne, but it caused the skin on my chin to become incredibly dry and bumpy, which then began to spread up the rest of my face. It was horrible! I stopped using this product, switched back to the foaming cleanser, and within a few days my skin was back to normal. It must be something specific with my skin that caused that reaction, but just be wary of the possibility if you use this product."
2,Perfectly simple for beginners,"I am an architecture student who is always looking for new ideas on how to present my work graphically. I purchased 'Idea Index' after having read all of the great reviews about the book. I believe it is a perfect reference for beginners who have little experience in the field of graphic design, and also for those who have a penchant for Microsoft clip art.For anyone who is serious about graphic design, consider purchasing something with more substance."
4,Great pocket guide.,This is a great little source of ideas to keep in your back pocket. It is good to flip through when you need to work past a creative blcok.
1,Grossly Overrated; Not For Professionals,"Given the reputation of Jim Krause and the number of positive reviews praising his booklet 'Idea Index' I did expect a lot. I was greatly disappointed: (1) the text is by far too superficial to even touch upon the real problems hidden behind a given idea, and; what is most unpleasant, (2) the illustrations simply do not play in the pro's leage.Everyone finding inspiration in in 'Idea Index' will equally love the infamous Corel Draw Clipart Collection. The rest of us would get more ideas in any Graphis periodical or simply on a walk in the park."
4,A reference guide,"This is exactly what the title implies. This is an index of ideas you can use in graphic design. There is not a lot of explanation, but it is helpful, even for the beginner.The book has some discussion that explains things like typographic treatments, but it is only a couple of pages long. It then goes you examples of different effects and gives quick points to give you some guidance. For example, it has three samples of blurring, and on the opposite page, says things like ""blur to convey motion or emotion,"" ""use a blurred image as a backdrop,"" and ""contrast a blurred image with a sharp image."" This helps the designer generate ideas for his or her creation.I believe this would be a handy reference for all graphic designers."
1,nothing much,"as a creative director, i was impressed by the reviews here - so I ordered one for our team... it was a dissappointing book..."
5,Great to improve your ideas,"Ideal to make you give one more step on improving your ideas. It won't be the solution for your lack of inspiration, but once you have the basic idea for your job, it will help you make it much more interesting. This is a book to keep on your desk... what makes its size and shape perfect for that!"
5,geezum!,"this is a NICE book.This is book for those who are at least somewhat aquainted with the principals of graphic design (and are maybe too busy to have the time to actually read technical wordy book.. this is a picture book. You see and draw your own conclusions and decide your own methodology)Jim Krause is a brilliant designer... and just seeing all the ""variations on a theme"" (diffrent ideas for one concept or word) he does all in one organised place; its a beautiful thing. Even on the occassions when I didnt like the design, I usually found it impressive; aside from that.. well... you cant win them all, can you?! ^_~If you can conceptualize and execute designs, but need a little nudge or a fresh outlook now and again this is a great book; full of ""now why didn't *I* think of that?"" ideas."
5,Stories from the Soul,"If you are a storyteller, if you are interested in portraying historic characters, if you like good writing--then this slim volume is for you. Goodman creates six characters drawn from the strong women of her southwestern Virginia childhood mountain roots. Each tale can stand alone, but together they form a sga of the mountains that shaped the six lives. The clear, srtong voices created by Goodman's pen lifts the women from any stereotypical stigmas. They are very real, some, eerily real. Warning: Despite it's division into six parts,do not expect to be able to put this work down and pick it up again later: Each story is complete, but the power of Goodman's writing hold you until all six tales are read and you will ache for more. As a read-aloud it has even more power. Her ability to make the story ""live"" in two worlds is a testament to her poetic abiliteis and skill as a storyteller."
5,Ideal for those looking to self-study!,"So, I had been looking around for a kanji book for quite some time to study in between my actual Japanese classes over the summer. I wanted to find something where I could easily learn without having to find other person to guide me along, and could figure things out from just the book. I think this book definitely has everything you could want in a book like that. There space for practicing writing them, practices that involve using multiple kanji to make new words(allowing you both on- and kun- pronunciation efficiently), and reading practice. I would definitely recommend this to the self-studying, and really any learner of Japanese."
5,Recommended,For anyone interested in learning the basic Kanji in the Japanese language this book is a must accessory. The introduction is done step by step so as not get confused and to digest these letters with easiness.
4,"Great, but a bit dated.","Great book, but a little dated. Definitely a strong academic approach to learning kanji."
5,"Finished with Vol. 1, on to Vol. 2!","Volume 2 picks up where vol. 1 left off (naturally!!)... There are quite a few interesting exercises that challenge you to use what you have learned in each chapter. This is the second book in a great series, and the only ones I found like it while I was in Japan. Like everyone else says, be sure to learn hiragana and katakana before buying this book. ...only those more serious about mastering Japanese need apply."
3,No Way!,Thirty bucks? are you kidding me? import fees or not no way you shell out that amount of cash for this CD.
1,A pathetic T&A TV movie that fails at every turn,"This lame attempt to cash in on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit craze is neither a comedy nor a drama. It is not sexy enough to attract jiggle fans and it is not barbed enough satire to actually explore this ""genre"" of cultural exploitation."
4,Don't look here: Now available on ICON with Jochum's Bruckner,"Crisp, slow, well recorded performances. Warm in the Austrian manner; perhaps Jochum's best Beethoven cycle of his 3 cycles. This item is being charged very dearly here at Amazon Marketplace, but ICON has released these very performances WITH Jochum's last Bruckner symphony cycle for really, really low price. That's the way to go."
1,Keep Looking,"Don't bother with this pencil sharpener. It doesn't sharpen evenly (i.e. half the circumference of the sharpened graphite will still be covered by wood) and there's no auto-stop feature, despite what other reviewers may say. This thing will definitely eat pencils until they are gone.I couldn't even get a good sharp point on pencils most of the time; usually the very tip is broken and squared off.The 10-year warranty is great but I can't imagine ten years of crummy pencils. I'll probably switch back to Panasonic."
1,Sharpener doesn't last,"I am a first-grade teacher, and choose to sharpen student pencils to save time. I am having problems with this sharpener. It seems to bind up and stop sharpening unless I have the pencil in just the right place. It started out working well, but it hasn't lasted. I have had it just over 6 weeks. I thought this one was supposed to be the best."
1,Worst pencil sharpener ever,"I am an 4th grade teacher and this sharpener is the worst one i have ever used. It makes a terribly loud horrible noise, it breaks all of my pencil's tips and above all, it barely sharpens anything!! I am going out of my mind and wish I could find a good one."
2,not impressed,"This is my 2nd electric sharpener this year. Both of them have been X-Acto which is a name I have trusted in cutting blades, but the electric sharpeners aren't good quality. This specific model worked fine for a month and now it stops and starts while sharpening if it works at all. I have taken it apart and there is nothing trapped in the blades - it's just a poor quality machine."
2,Not up to snuff,"This pencil sharpener was FABULOUS when I first got it. After a short while, maybe a month, it only worked properly with ""good"" pencils (i.e. Ticonderoga. It did NOT sharpen those gummy pretty pencils, nor office depot/ office max pencils). Now it rarely works at all. Admittedly, I use a pencil sharpener a lot. I am a teacher and this is my 5th electric sharpener in two years."
3,tricky but works great with a trick,At the end of the sharpening give the pencil a half twist. Otherwise it seems to grind to one side.
3,Not their debut,This is not their debut album. It is their second full length and they've had tons of singles and such released.
5,Wonderful Book!,"I received this book as a gift and found it to be quite entertaining. Nice anthology of articles on investing, fincancial history, and business success in general. Very eclectic group of writers ranging from Benjamin Graham to P.T. Barnum (I have always found Barnum's ""Rules for Success"" to be invaluable). Very hard to put down once you have begun. Even harder not to finish the book a bit wiser."
3,Good Book.,"If only if you are an investor, and enjoy such books. This is the place to get it and read about this excellent book to help with Monetary Economic Thought."
2,flaps & straps,I got mine opened up the box and checked it out put it back in the box and sent it back! very very large bigger than i expected but only 1 zipper pouch and not the one i needed. all the pockets were straps and flaps that i feel would spill ur gear all over if u were climbing up a tree. seemed to be made well but not for me.
5,"Watch the Asperger's kid & learn, but it's more than that","My #1 son, in a perhaps jaded moment, called this book a sci-fi ""Stand By Me"" (the Stephen King story & marvelous movie). It is that -- a bunch of misfits stuck together on a quest.My favorite character is the Aspy girl, who, at a crucial moment, shows how clever the learning different can be.This novel works very much like a video game in that there are a series of challenges, and the characters have to figure out how to get through them. One challenge will remind those of a certain non-target age of ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade."" The kids have to pool their knowledge and their wits, to see beyond the obvious.They also have to figure out how to get along together. This is not easy. These outcasts are not all friends.For those worried about ""dark"" YA novels, don't be. This one turns out fine enough. It's a good read."
2,color blind,the picture is very misleading the picture looks like they are black NOT SHINY silver i was looking forward to these being BLACK to put on my BLACK vehicle so now i am in the red for something that i thought were BLACK how do you get a picture to look BLACK instead of Silver very wrong so if you want BLACK ONES DON'T BUY THESE
5,Better than all the the rest,"As a working mom I don't have time to read very much, but I know it's important to really understand what is going on with my child as she develops. This book is great, and the next book about two year olds is even better. It is so helpful to understand why some issues are so challenging at this age and to get ideas for what to do!"
2,You've Got to Be Kidding....Right??,"I just purchased this disc....ok, Rex Rideout is generally considerred a ""good"" producer. He worked with some of the best in Contempo Jazz: Marion Meadows, Najee and George Howard.But, nothing could have prepared me for this pap!Words cannot express my disappointment....The cut, ""Stay"", is the best cut on the disc!!! The rest of the stuff is total under utilization of the ""talent"" at hand.So sad, so unhappy you will be when you purchase.....you've now been warned twice......"
2,This is a classic case....,"Rex Rideout is generally a fine producer. He has composed for Marion Meadows, Najee and especially Will Downing and the late George Howard. This could be one project where his concept fell flat. OR a classic case of a producer being able to write for others but not for their own project. Evidence of which is there are about 5 reviews here and TWO USED CD's above available for sale....you do the math/listening....."
5,All my hottest tracks,This cd is crazy. I am a deejay in Long Island. These are all my hottest tracks. What A Feeling is an anthem. Mason - Exceeder is the bomb. The new Ian Van Dahl is hot. I would say this is the hottest cd comp of the year so far.
4,merlyn,Merlyn does do a good job on this cd with phat breakbeats and good mixing. I've seen him live and he goes off..
3,Okay....... but not that great,"This cd is definatley a step down from the artist ability. He's an incredible dj and has produced some amazing tracks in the past, but this cd really could have been a lot better for him. I have been a fan of his since I have entered the scene and was extremely disappointed with this album. Though he does throw down some tight breakbeat tracks it could have been better."
5,2006 Who Killed the Electric Car?,"""The Car That Could"" does a wonderful job of detailing the history and development of the GM EV1. The story, however, has moved on since its publication. GM and all the large automakers eviscerated the ZEV mandate, reclaimed their vehicles, and concentrated on combustion engine business as usual. Then Toyota introduced the combined battery electric/gasoline Prius, and automotive history took a turn back towards electrics. Shnayerson would be wise to write an updated version on the subject. In the absence of his work, one can turn to Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that will Recharge America by Sherry Boschert. This territory is ripe for more material it would appear."
5,HOOKED ON 7TH HEAVEN,"This show is all I watch! The actors and actreses are the best! I exspecilly like Lucy ""Beverly Mitchell."" The thing about this show is they make it have the problems of every day life.From drugs to boyfriends. It is so real I can picture myself being in the show or having the same problems.i went through season one and two in two days it was so good!i cant wait for season three. I have already put money aside to by it and you should too. I hope this review helped."
5,Good for kids,I think it is another great way for kids to learn good morals and values and see how they benefit you all through your life.
5,bad,It should have used copies of the item selling for $8.00. I bought season one would want it for more than ten dollars.
1,problek with dvd,Towards the middle of the season it started skipping or locked up. For the most part it still works. I am not satified but I am still going to keep the dvd.
4,Interesting show,"I thought 7th heaven season 2 was a pretty interesting season. Although some episodes seem like they go on forever, others are interesting and entertaining. although it has things like making out and lots of disrespect from the kids in the show, I still would reccomend it."
3,story is good but the quality is a disaster!!,I like this series very much but the quality of the dvd makes me feel angry! I don't know how to explain it the best way but it seems that they had the wrong camera sometimes. Take the scenes when they zoom on the house: there are steps in the scene. No smooth zoom :( Today you can change such material! We can see this on other series or dvds contaning older material which is reworked..Next minus: the missing subtitles! For every little series there are subtitles.. But this series which is very popular has none..
4,A literate and wonderful family TV drama,"7TH HEAVEN, the crown jewel of the WB Network for a whopping ten seasons, is a wonderful and literate family TV drama. We live these flawed and realistic characters; the writing, mostly by Sue Tenney and creator Brenda Hampton, is truthful and thoughful and free of profanity. The entire cast is magnificent. Only a too lenient TVG rating on every episode of a show this mature and adult seems ludicrous. I'd give it a TVPG or even TV14 for realistic, mature themes.So why are we only up to season two on the DVD boxed sets? Let's get some action going with production of more 7TH HEAVEN seasons on DVD! There are seven full seasons to bring out!"
5,A great show!!!!!!!!!!!,"My family loved this one, too!! We're looking forward to the next season. However, it seems like some shows take forever to get out on DVD. We really feel like we've gotten to know a wonderful family."
5,Excellent value,After shopping around to other sites (including the Manufacturer's own site) Amazon had the best price and best shipping!! The quilt is beautiful and the shams are really large. I would recommend this set to anyone looking for a grown up surfer boy look as the colours are not too bright and the quality is excellent.
5,Informative and Beautiful!,"The is absolutely the best book I've seem on iris. The book is well laid out and very informative. Grosvenor is a leading authority on iris and comprehensively explains each genus as a group as to characteristics, culture and breeding. Then he gives detailed descriptions the best cultivars of each type. The photography throughout the book is fantastic and completes this book as a treasure!"
3,Not much technical substance. Better coffee table books out there.,"Description lead to me to believe this book had more technical and reference substance than it does. Not something I would recommend for an experienced gardener looking that. Written content is mostly very general stuff with a nice ""shop talk"" factoid scattered here and there. Very good quality photography & print but few large sized or garden inspiration images so better coffee table books are out there as well. For me will be just another book skimmed through once and then left sitting on the shelf."
2,it's ok,Its ok I could barely hear few songs when I'm using my headphones. When I'm using my stereo I have to crank up the volume to listen to the songs.
1,Caution!,"I was suspicious of the ridiculously low prices from the 3rd-party vendors, and ordered this unit from Amazon instead. The unit arrived packaged in a small clear plastic bag, with a stapled paperboard top and a computer-printed adhesive label stating that it was for the Cardo 500. However the unit actually inside the bag was NOT the one pictured, and definitely NOT for the Cardo 500.The connector on the unit looked vaguely familiar, so before I started the return-process, I checked it out with a Cardo 700 that I had loaned to my brother. Sure enough, it fit the 700, so I gave it to him instead of returning it."
5,Stacking Cups for Babies,"I bought this set of stacking cups for my great-nephew, who recently turned 1 yrs. old, for his birthday. He loves them! I have been told they are some of his absolute favorite things to play with, so I am very pleased with my purchase!"
3,Geography lesson,Would have been more helpful to have ten. I did not count before ordering. The product is very good otherwise
3,Decent cups but expensive,I was looking for some stacking cups for the sandbox and these are great because they are sturdy and have little small holes in the bottom but still hold the sand. However $8 for plastic? Pricey.
5,GREAT toy for the bath,"My daughter loves these, especially in the bath. She is fascinated by the water coming out of the holes in the bottom and never seems to tire of collecting them all around her and putting them in her mouth. She also splashes the water with them and bangs them together. TOTALLY worth the $."
5,"Simple, but not boring!","My DS is 10 months old and has been playing with these cups for the past few months. Truly, they are one of his favorite toys (much to my surprise!). He will sit in his high chair while I make dinner and bang the cups together, chew on them, throw them on the floor, etc. Or, we'll sit on the floor together and I'll stack them so he can knock them over. He has not gotten bored with them yet. This is one toy I actually have to take away from him; he doesn't just abandon it and move on to something else.For this price, these cups have proven themselves more than worthwhile for us."
5,Love them,"My husband bought these for our daughter when she was about 5 months old - she's now 9 mos. They have been a great toy, at first just to hold a touch, then to pull apart, now to gnaw on and try to un-stack and put back together. Such a simple thing! Still, it ranks second to her favorite toy - a wooden spoon. :)"
3,Holes in bottom - not for bath,I thought these cups could double as bath play fun but they have holes in the bottom of each one. Very dissapointing. Now I need to buy a second set of cups that don't have holes for bath time scoop and play.
3,Better ones available at IKEA,"I didn't buy these cups, but I did buy a set at IKEA that are cheaper, and better looking. Each cup has a different rim design, and several cups have accessory colors and shapes around them. My son LOVES them!"
3,Small cups,"The smallest cup is SMALL - maybe an inch in diameter. The colors are different than the ones in the picture and I would have preferred that the colors went in order of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, etc) but that's my own OCD. I will look for bigger cups to make stacking easier."
2,just ok,"I was at at a play group that had cups like this and my 8 mo old daughter loved them to play and knock down the stack. The group leader said they were quite a few years old but I was determined to find them. These cups are much smaller than expected and they don't have a very big ""lip"" on them therfore they don't stack very well. They do have holes in them to drain well when you wash them. My daughter does enjoy them but I think she would more if they stacked better."
2,Smell is a deal-killer for me.,"I'm glad Amazon sent me the email reminding me to review this because now I'll remember to cancel the standing order as well. I don't know if its the ""verbena"" or what--but I don't like the smell of this. Now--I'm hyper-picky about smell, but if I were you, I'd buy a single bottle first before investing in the shipping program.I clean the bathrooms (well). I walk by the cleaned bathroom and think, ""It smells like urine.""I'll find something else. I don't like bleach (smell again--like sweat socks and locker rooms).Don't worry about me. I'll be just fine."
5,Works hard and smells great!,"Mrs. Meyer's Toilet Bowl Cleaner could be better only if it generated its own magic brush to do the swishing. I am a great fan of almost all the Mrs. Meyer's products I've tried. I always use the Geranium scent, which my sister-in-law described as smelling like a freshly-crushed geranium petal. The all-purpose cleaner and countertop cleaner are also great."
5,"Works well, natural and smells ok, better for septic","Smell is very strong but I think that is a good thing, this is meant to clean toilet bowls so I would expect that. From what I read it is much, much better for the environment and even more important it is better for your septic system. I know about septics and I can tell everyone that a lot of the cleaners we use are damaging our septic systems. A septic requires certain bacteria for it to function properly and last long. The harsh cleaners kill this bacteria, which will shorten the life of the system and cause problems. Using natural cleaners like this help a lot. Also if your home does have a septic put in a septic treatment. Amazon sells a great one that comes in a blue box and single bags you can throw right in the toilet and flush. It is great since there is no contact with the stuff. The bag dissolves in the tank, unlike others that you have to open with scissors and dump in. Its made by P.E.C. and its called Bio-R."
3,Not Yet Perfect,"The ingredients are definitely a big step toward a safer and more natural cleaning product, but the smell is still very unnaturally strong. I am sensitive to the smell in most household cleaners, and this product is no different, in that respect. However, it cleans very well, which is often a concern when looking into ""natural"" cleaners. I am still in search of the perfect cleaner."
4,"Smells Great, Cleans well.","Not as thick as a traditional toilet cleaner but it certainly does the job and I like the mission behind the Meyer's Brand so it works great for me!Smell is very strong so if you don't like that in a cleaner, I would stay away!"
3,Did they switch fragrances?,"I've used Mrs. Meyers lemon verbena products before and loved the fragrance. That's why I purchased a case of the toilet bowl cleaner. But this product smells different, kind of a chemical smell mixed in with something other than the lemon verbena that I'm used to in their hand soaps and dish washing detergents.It cleaned as well as any other toilet bowl cleaner, no better, no worse. But I'm disappointed that it didn't have that nice clean lemony fragrance that I'm used to and was the reason that I bought this product."
1,Why the $10.00 price increase?,"I love this product and have been buying it for years but why has the price gone up so drastically? I have bought this 6 bottle case for years and have paid $22.95 with ""subscribe and save"" and now it's $32.84! That's almost a $10.00 increase since the last time I purchased it in only 4 months ago. With the environmentally friendly industry now expanding by leaps and bounds and so many other choices out there, I'm not sure why this company would want to drive away customers by such a radical price change. What a shame; I have now cancelled my subscription and am looking for another product or supplier."
5,Best for Organizing Genealogy,"This is the best tool for getting and staying organized when starting one's family history. Also great for those who have been doing research for some time. It is simple, easy as far as that goes in doing research. No fancy letters and numbers to cypher. While the tape is a bit dry, it is still the most comprehensive, easy to understand and put to work quickly method available on the market. I've used it several times only because one can not possibly start watching it and not do anything to get started. Therefore, it has to be turned off and on to learn the next step bringing one closer to achieving the ability to find anything one needs in 30 seconds or less. Setting up the system does take some time in the beginning, but if followed, one will not be disorganized ever again."
4,"Good, user-friendly Sanskrit-English Lexicon","Cappeller's English translation of his German Wörterbuch is a very usable lexicon for beginning and intermediate readers of Sanskrit. Lemmata are given in Devanagari and the individual articles are concise and yet cover the important uses for a wide range of classical and post classical texts (the work is less useful for Vedic texts for which there are other lexica available). Using this lexicon I have found it rare to need to resort to the more unwieldy works by Monier-Williams, Macdonell or Apte. The major drawback of the Chowkhomba edition, and the reason for the 4 star rating out of 5, is the poor quality of the binding. I was forced early on to have mine rebound. All in all though, a very good lexicon if you can find it."
3,Go ahead and blast me for not reviewing the book itself...,"... but I just had to say this to the publisher:You're kidding, right? $35 for a Kindle-edition book?<end of rant>"
3,Nontraditional dark fiction.,"Borderlands is a series of horror/dark fantasy/suspense anthologies that attempts to push the boundaries of concept and storytelling. The first three volumes were overwhelmingly excellent, but this fourth is somewhat of a disappointment. It simply doesn't possess the power of the earlier material. It starts off with a fairly strong handful of stories, including some quiet horror from Dennis Etchison, and a wierd tale of a child prisoner by William F. Wu. Later there are some good stories by William Browning Spencer, David Herter, and James C. Dobbs. Most of the rest are okay, but not very memorable. ""Monotone"" is so poorly written I don't know how any editor continued reading past the first couple lines. I guessed the ""twist"" of ""The Long Holiday"" by the second page; I'm sure it's been done before. I'd like to see this series continue, but I hope the grade of material returns to its previous greatness."
2,"Borderlands 4 had possibilities, but fell short of them.","As a contributor to Borderlands 4, (The Long Holiday) I must say that there are some good moments in the collection. For the most part, however, the selections are trite and formulaic. I wrote my piece as a novice, and was utterly surprised at its acceptance. It's clearly a first-attempt, and not improved by the editor's inexplicable decision to remove whole transition paragraphs. The volumes prior to this particular one had originality; it seems Monteleone chose more by personal taste in this one than by innovation. Instead of groundbreaking new talent and short horror fiction, we're left instead with ill-presented pulp. At least the purchasers of the paperback version won't be paying the $65 price of the slipcovered hardbound limited edition. Obviously a work indicative of waning interest and/or capability on the part of the editor."
1,Pablum for the Horror-Challenged,"I read this anthology a few years ago, and even know of someone with (GAH!) the limited edition hardcopy. The best thing about that edition is the sturdy dustjacket, and the purchasers of the paperback version don't even get that. The stories seem to have been chosen with an eye toward convoluted vocabulary rather than plot or originality. They certainly *sound* as though they should be horrifying. Unfortunately, the only suspense involved is in how long the genre can support itself with potboilers like this anthology being pushed as cutting-edge. Staring at the crevices in tree bark would provide more thrills and surprises, and circumvent the whole process of creating this pulp waste."
2,Pencil sharpener,I wanted a sharpener that had two cutting discs. The single disc leaves the back side of the pencil with wood on the back half. This caused me to sharpen the pencil more ofter. I purchased the 2 disc sharpener by X-ACTO and there is a world of difference. The X_ACTO 1031 is the best.
5,Excellent,"This is indeed the finest study of Jefferson's political thought to date. Unlike other authors, Mayer penetrates to the core of Jefferson's political philosophy, revealing him to be fundamentally a ""real whig,"" with emphasis on his distrust of government."
5,GREAT TIME FOR A BOOK LIKE THIS,"When the world is wondering what is up with the garbage in the middle east. When we now have it at our front doorstep we need to understand it. What's up with these people? Why do they act like they do? Why do they feel like they do? And how does it effect us all? Another book that I recommend that explores these things from a spiritual perspective is called, ""I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You""."
1,READ THE BOOK,"The pagan warrior from Jordan has not read the book, or he would realize that it says exactly what he says -- and it does not present the house of Sa'ud as the only face of Islam. Rather, it presents a sympathetic view of Shi'ism and especially Sufism, in addition to traditional Sunnism. The book has been attacked by Western Islamophobes for its manifest sympathy for Islam."
1,"Simplistic, Naive","The author of this book is a neo-conservative so-called expert on Islam. He doesn't speak or read Arabic. He is not a Middle East scholar. Rather than explore the complexities of Middle Eastern history or Islam, he has decided to focus on a narrow brand of Islamic fundamentalism to show how Islam is a threat to the west.Does this sound familiar? This combination of naivite and narrow interests got the United States in the Iraq war. Readers -- American voters, for that matter -- would do well to avoid this kind of book and this kind of simplistic thinking."
1,Crucial fact omitted by the author,"The author mendaciously presents Ottoman domination in the Balkans as begnign and illuminating. He blithely ignores the genocide represented by the Turkish devshirme system -- the ""Blood Levy"" of Christian boys kidnapped into the Janissary Corps -- and pretends that the murderous darkness of Ottoman misrule was somehow enlightened (and the resistance to it, notably by Balkan Christians, condemnable). This is propaganda currently designed to facilitate Turkey's entrance into the EU (""Europe""). It poisons the well from which all well meaning people need to learn about the true tragedy of non-Muslim communities ruled by Islam."
2,Good book about Saudi Arabia; not so good about Islam,"Schwartz is right to find two faces of Islam. But he is naive to think that only the face he approves of is the real one. Schwartz is a convert to the beautiful but heretical Sufi branch of Islam. So it is not quite right to portray him as ""a Jewish historian.""The book has a sharp tone and makes a strong case for reassessing our ties with Saudi Arabia.Schwartz does not address that the two faces are found from the very beginning of in the life of the Prophet himself."
4,A Very Serious Scholar!,"Well, Stephen is an old friend of mine from times in Kosovo. The ideas in this book represent years of research and thinking. They also represent long hours of listening to his probing of Islam while we drank coffee in the Grand Hotel Pristina. His mind is so detailed and he talks so fast, it is difficult to follow. I have used his book on Kosovo in my honors courses and students found it very ""enlightening."" The Two Faces of Islam is intense, complex, detailed, thought-provoking. One should never underestimate the thoroughness and penetration of the author's thinking and knowledge. I have trouble with some of his ideas, but no one raises serious questions better than he does, which is his intent and his talent."
5,The two-faced Wahhabi-Saudi regime - Be Alert!,"An enlightening book. A favorite passage: ""The Wahhabi-Saudi Brotherhood were young sons of the desert who had emerged from a hopeless nothingness of petty rivalries and banditry, and who viewed life in terms devoid of sophistication and cosmopolitan understanding. They could not imagine learning from the rest of the Islamic teachers, much less the rest of global society. Rather, they would teach the world about the emptiness of their hearts, which reproduced the void of their social existence."" p. 104."
1,Polemic Leavened with Invective,Islamic terror and its roots are an important and fascinating topic worthy of someone who actually speaks Arabic and is a scholar of the region's history. This gadfly book is composed mostly of invective and polemics. I recommend to anyone who seriously wants to consider this subject the work of Professor Bernard Lewis.
4,A serious omission,"He describes Bosnian Mulsims as the very model of Islamic tolerance for other religions, but he omits their widespread participation on the side of the Nazis in World War II which included rounding up and murdering their Jewish neighbors. While this is not to suggest they deserved the cruelties of the recent horrors in Bosnia, ""every ten years or so they blew something up."""
3,AtheistWorld.Com Book Review,"Good book but too many false statements.A BETTER read would be ""Islam Exposed"" by Solomon Tulbure"
2,"OK, but not great","Schwartz's book provides one of the most comprehensive histories of Saudi Arabia to date. While the historical aspects of his writing are strong, though, he tends to drift into diatribes against the ruling party in Saudi Arabia that undermine the more contemporary portions of his book. Overall, this book is good reading as background to the problems and successes in Saudi Arabia, but ought to be supplemented by other sources (I would recommend Dr. Bernard Lewis)."
3,sweaty feet,the socks are padded nicely for wearing boots in the winter time. but they dont breath very much at all. so warmer climate users need not to try. if my feet werent swimming by the third hour of my ten hour shift these would be great.
5,Most excellent,I put these socks on as soon as they arrived. Very comfy. I wear a size 9 shoe and these were not too big. Great fit and quality.
5,warm socks,I gave these as a Christmas gift for my sons in law... they love them. Both plan to use them for hunting.
4,"Good, durable sock",I've been working on factory concrete floors for 36 years. I've tried every work sock imaginable. These socks are near the top of my list. Good cushioning and they seem well made. They should last a while and not end up as dust rags after six months. I wear six inch work boots (Timberland) 95% of the time so these socks are ideal with them. Recommend this product. One thing to note though is the color of the sock isn't athletic sock white. These socks have a slight gray color to the fabric in the leg area.
2,It's a Pill,"The socks look great when first taken out of the package. They feel pretty good as well. They are labelled as being US Made ... A rarity these days. But run once through the wash, and they take on a ratty appearance with considerable pilling. It will take time to know how well the wear, but my confidence is lowered."
5,Great socks.,Have worn these socks for about a week now working outside and they are great with my steel toes. Very comfortable all around even in extreme heat.
5,Great for what they are,"I was looking for EXTRA durable socks because I have worn holes in ALL my regular Hanes-type white socks since we moved and our new house has a rough ceramic tile floor. So far so good with these durable socks. They are pricy for socks. But they do the job they are meant to do. I do wash them inside out every time as instructed.They are also nice and warm compared to my older cheaper socks. Next summer, we'll see if I use them at all. I generally like ankle socks in summer anyway. These were fine during fall. My feet were not any more sweaty even with the extra thickness."
1,Warning Syndicated Version,"I just received my boxed set. I cannot say how dissapointed I was to discover that this is the cut up syndicated version.I feel ripped off. The crucial and touching scene where the Reverend Jim is presented with his cabbie hat is just one of the cut out scenes. They should be required to state that this is not the original released versions. Rather than ""The Complete Second Season"", it should be titled ""The INCOMPLETE Second Season""!"
3,About method actor Christopher Lloyd (Jim),"A method actor is a very deranged person in real life. Method actors crazily feel they can't play a character unless they figure out that character's motivation! Also, method actor's often really hit other actors (or the method actor gets hit himself or herself) in a scene instead of just faking the hit.This can result in serious bodiy harm. Furthermore, a method actor often does crazy things like staying up late for real just so they'll appear tired. And lastly, method actors often really put themselves into the mood of their characters and they can't easily get out of their character's mood once the director yells ""cut"". Remember all this when you watch Christopher Lloyd in the second season oif Taxi and on so you don't admire his performance as Reverend Jim too much."
5,"I have ALWAYS Loved ""TAXI""...","If you are a ""TAXI"" lover, this collection is a MUST. The very best scenes with Louie (Danny De Vito), Latke Gravis (Andy Kaufman), Reverend Jim (Christopher Lloyd), Alex (Judd Hirsch), and Mary Lou Henner's ""Elaine"" are all included in this collection. BUY THIS DVD COLLECTION - too good to pass up!"
5,Outstanding series,This is the best of the comiedy series for the last 30 years! I can't wait for season 3!
2,A little more than natural history,"David Quammen is a well-known writer who compiled this book of many of his articles from years past. He relates human issues to natural history phenomena in each article. I enjoy his style of writing however was bogged down by the political soap boxing by the end. Even though I agree with much of what he saw saying, I guess I just was not expecting the intense commentary."
2,Boring Kickboxing Drills,"This is one in a series of four new videos that have been release from Gaiam. I love the two with Tanja Djelevic, but I don't really care for the other two with Patricia Moreno. She presents kickboxing drills and the routine is not all that fun. You get 50 and 30 minute routines, plus a 10 minute bonus ab workout. The ab workout was the only thing I liked on the DVD.For kickboxing DVDs that provide a great workout and lots of fun too, I recommend Quickfix Total Cardio Kick with Janis Saffell and 10 Minute Solution Kickbox Bootcamp with Keli Roberts instead."
3,Just okay,"Although I really like Patricia Moreno's yoga video, this is a bit too easy and slow moving."
3,I've had better ...,"She pauses a lot during the workout which led me to continuously lose momentum. When I do these exercise videos I just want to go, go, go! Plus I had to add light-weights to the routine to make it more challenging. Overall I'd say it was just OK."
2,Maybe I didnt know how to use it,Well ... lets make it simpleeach time I do fat check I get a new number . Not every day . But if I do 3 time checking in 3 minuts the difference may become 5% . up to now I dont know if my fat is 34% or 20% because I'm getting all those reading in different time.Secondly . The scale will store only the last time you did the measurment . So if you are planning to read historic data . Just forget it.
2,Inaccurate Photo,"The actual product has four rows of 25 rather than five rows of 20 as shown in the photo. While this may be exactly what some folks need, it doesn't work for me. For those that prefer the 4/25 set-up, it seems fairly well constructed and the lid fits snugly and it may be worth a try."
3,Flawed but we kept it,"The problem with this light is that both sides of the tube are open. If you mount it up and down you can see the bulb. Not pretty. it is not worth the retail price in my view. It is better than builder grade stuff, due to the simplicity of the design."
3,Brown not Orange,"The highlighters are good in how they work -- but the color is a murky brown, not orange. Sadly, there's such a limited offering of alternatives (at reasonable price) that they have to do. But not attractive coloring."
5,Very entertaining and enjoyable book,"Trilobite is a really perfect example of a paleontology book for an educated layman. It is very informative, surprisingly detailed and a fun read. In many books of this type long digressions tell the biographies and anecdotes of discoverers etc... But Fortey keeps nicely on focus, and while he will discuss Thomas Hardy and some personal anecdotes they are brief and always entertaining and illuminating.Also I have to love a book where the author talks of eating limulus (Horseshoe crab) in Thailand, not a particularly successful meal. Fortey truly loves Trilobites and his affection is infectious, I still find them creepy but I can see the fascination."
4,a super read!!!!!,honestly.... i never thought that there were so many species of trilobites..... Fortey's writing style is charming.... the author is definitely passionate about these prehistoric creatures.... and is well reflected here....
2,"4 stars, minus 2 stars for linking this to ""evolution""","I would've given this book 4 stars, but to link the trilobites to evolution this way is very misleading. The whole unbiased scientific community today advocates the ""intelligent design theory"". I thought that people who hallucinate darwinist pseudo-science only find room for their pens in commercial corporate pages. Use this book for information about trilobites, but use Harun Yahya's books to read about evolution first. They're legally available online for free even."
4,Starts slow but is well worth the time,"I almost returned this book to the library after the disappointing first chapter. That would have been a mistake. Fortey's prose tend to ramble (the book just uses too many words to say what it has to say) but the content makes the prose (which, in fairness, often were entertaining) well worth wading through. I had the advantage of a keen ambient interest in the critters going into the book but Fortey's command of the key discoveries and their implications is outstanding and his passion for trilobites is contagious. The book could use about twice the figures, but has included over 25 including some very instructive ones. On the whole a worthwhile read."
3,Glad to be done with it,"This was not the book about trilobites that I expected. The first thirty pages hardly mentioned trilobites at all but instead were a side excursion into a Thomas Hardy literary landscape in which the author attempts to prove to us that he knows who Thomas Hardy is and that there was a connection to trilobites somewhere. Along the way we learn that this author, who presumably is able to write scientific research articles, feels compelled to demonstrate to lay readers that he is also something of a litterateur, and is able to blend that into a discussion about trilobites. Along the way, the author loses sight of his subject and his audience as well and the general result is that the reader ends up learning less than he otherwise might have because of the literary diversions and pretensions of the author. The first 30 and the last 20 pages and much interior text was wasted. Three stars."
2,"Not a bad boar brush, but a misleading listing on Amazon","This is a decent boar bristle brush, but it is listed on the Amazon web site as a ""Professional"". However on close examination and a review of the Omega website, it is not in their Professional series, which is a different line of Omega boar brushes. The listing is misleading.[...]"
3,Very informative but slightly misleading on recovery time,"While I found the book very informative in discussing the related symptoms of Bell's Palsy and also the various methods of treatment, I was very discouraged by the length of time all patients in the book were aflicted with the illness. I was diagnosed with Bell's Palsy and was told that it could last from 3 weeks to 3 months. But after reading the book I thought my recovery would take years. In the end, I was very fortunate that my symptoms disappeared after only 4 weeks. I feel the book should have discussed case studys that were shorter, or at least mentioned that in some cases the recovery time was significantly shorter. However, this was the only reference I could find on Bell's Palsy, so I am still glad that I found the book. Thanks for the information."
1,disappointed,"I felt this book focused entirely on the negative aspects of this disease. Clearly, there are many difficult problems associated with Bell's palsy but this book did little to enlighten. The author's cynical portrayal of many of the treatment options only serves to discourage people. I would not recommend this book as it neither enlightens nor encourages people."
4,Very Pleased,I bought this book for my mother who has had Bell's Palsy for five years and has had little to no recovery even after seeing dozens of doctors and trying every type of treatment. She and I thought this book was very helpful. My mother has been very frustrated and it was comforting to know that she is not the only person to feel this way. We could relate to the author extrememly well.
4,Good addition to The Firm series,"This is a very good workout for most intermediate and advanced levels. There's a lot of variety within the routines and the instructor is consistently adding in new moves as the cardio sections progress. The Firm has definitely come a long way since its first workout videos released in the late 80's.The routines here are effective, challenging and varied. However, I would not recommend this workout to someone who is still a beginner. I do wish there was better cuing and instruction in some of the sections. Occasionally the instructor does seem to run ahead without always verbally giving the viewer directions. Although after doing this workout several times, most viewers will probably start remembering the routine a bit more. If you're looking to add a new challenging and interesting workout dvd to your collection, I recommend giving this a try."
3,Not as smooth as some other Firm workouts,"I feel like this dvd provides me with a good overall workout, but I do have some issues with the choreography and cuing. Rebekah Sturkie is personable and attractive. Her cuing leaves much to be desired. Do not expect to get this workout down in the first few sessions - leave plenty of learning time because some of the moves aren't natural, the changes are abrupt, and often the cuing is late or nonexistant. Also, the music changes right in the middle of the workout.I like the variety of exercises and feel that I get a total body workout. I like the express version of the workout, except that it does not have any cardio segments.Would be a great workout with smoother transitions, much better cuing, and music that changes when the workout changes. I am used to better quality from The Firm."
5,Another fit Grandma,"I am a regular with The Firm Workouts and have quite a few. I've tried others and with one or two exceptions always come back.I really like this work-out. It is great in a Time Crunch offering a good variety of everything. Rebekah does a good job with cueing and the moves aren't difficult. As with most of the Firm workouts, there are basic moves and once you get them down, you can 'get' any of them.Although I also have the TransFIRMer, the Fanny Lifter and Firm Box, I really like the new ones that don't require climbing on a step--altough I take those out regularly as well. I'd recommend this one, although if you are newer it might be a bit difficult, be sure to follow the modified moves, and stick with it!"
4,Good yet fun workout!,I really liked this workout. It took until the second or third time of doing of it to really get it down and realize how much I liked it. This is one of my favorites of the new firms. I like the choreography and especially the music in this workout. I usually pair this with another firm workout though. Most of the new firms are not as tough as previous ones that utilize the fanny lifter or the transfirmer but I do like not having to use a step everytime I workout. I think the new firms are really fun and good for beginners once they learn the moves and more intermediate to advanced exercisers can use higher weights and pair with another workout and get great results while having fun. I recommend this workout. It combines cardio with light weight lifting for an overall good workout.
1,Fit Mom,"I was a big fan of the Firm in the 90s. This DVD did not stand up to the Firm of almost 16 years earlier. I was really disappointed. I found the moves to be unnecessarily complicated & difficult to pick up. The instructor was off cue & difficult to follow. Lousy camera angles & cheap in overall production. The background instructors seem as if they were doing the DVD for the first time. The master instructor, Rebekah Sturkie didn't stop talking for even a second. I was really hoping to love this DVD. It obviously fell short of my expectations.I also bought Tight Buns & Killer Legs. Hopefully that will be a much better program."
3,"Not a great workout, bad cuing","The moves on this video are very ""dancy"" and a little complicated. I have done this tape 4 times already, and I still mess up the moves. I guess the moves can be done, though, with a little practice, because there is a tutorial on the DVD. But who has time for that? I thought we were trying to ""Crunch Time""?? The instructor tries to kill not two, but three birds with one stone alot of times. For example, you do a lateral row, squat and hip abduction with one move. It sounds like a great concept, but just leads to improper form. Rebekah is a happy instructor, but her cuing is poor. At one point in the video, she's telling you to move your left leg, but she's moving her left leg, too - and fitness video instructors are supposed to cue everything ""opposite"" so that the viewer can follow along. So she messed me up. The video didn't give me a good strength workout. Cardio was decent, but the sequences were quick and complicated."
2,I am lost!!!!,I found this workout to be a big letdown; perhaps becuase I am not a cardio type of person. I prefer tonning exercises. One of the things that disappointes me in this video is that the instrucor does not emphasize breathing in any moment. I also found that Rebekah's instruction lacks momentum. In other words she does not cue us into the next move. The video is annoying because I never know what do next as she steps from one excercise to another without warning.
4,Great Workout Once You Master The Moves,"The complete workout really works me. At first, the moves seemed strange and confusing, but after just a few times, they were easier to manage. The best part of the workout is the midsection. Nothing else has worked my abs like that, the rope being the most clever. The only true weakpoint I noticed was the stretching. I always feel the need to do more stretching afterwords, and I advise others to do this also, add a cobra stretch, quad stretch and sit-and-reach type stretches just to make sure."
3,Not challenging enough,"Unfortunately this Firm workout didn't challenge me like some of their other videos. I was really looking forward to trying a new Firm DVD, but was quite disappointed on the lack of intesity. The cardio moves were too low impact and low intesity. Not the idea workout to intermediate to advanced."
4,Kick Butt Awesome Workout!,"I have been doing the FIRM for several years and usually go for the one hour DVDs. However, I needed something I could do at lunch since my schedule has changed a bit. The good news is my offce has a space with workout equipment and a TV & DVD player so I thought I would take advantage at lunch. However, I needed something shorter than 1 hour. This work out is an all over body toner with aerobics and in 45 minutes you have received the full benefit of a one hour work out. It is amazing how the time flies. It is fun, versatile and no muscle is left out of this compact, efficient workout."
2,Two stars is generous...,"Staring at the TV scratching your head while the instructor calls out a series of moves at breakneck speed with no breakdown beforehand is just not an effective workout. I have four dance workout dvds, all of which are much easier to follow than this thing. Maybe after 20 or 30 times watching it I might get the steps down. But then again, why would I want to bother? Stepford wives have more personality than the instructor and demonstrators on this video. This is my first Firm video, so maybe the blandness is a trait of the brand? Hope not. I just found Rebekah really irritating (sorry) and got sick of hearing her say the same things over and over. The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that the weight intervals were not as bad as the cardio, but I'd still take any of my other dvds ahead of this one."
3,I really wanted to like this DVD.,"As with any exercise video I purchase, I watch it once before attempting to do it myself. I was excited at first glance but a little concerned about the prompting for the cardio segments. Just watching it I realized it was going to be fast and when I attempted to do it, I gave up. I tried it again and gave up. Tried again by only doing the cardio and hitting rewind but gave up yet again. Maybe it's just me but I don't want to have to scratch my head, trip over my feet, and keep hitting the review button when I'm trying to workout. I like a hard workout but I don't like working hard to figure out what the instructor is doing.So, with that said, the workout itself was fine and I would give the DVD five stars for that. The only reason I give it three is for the prompting in the cardio segment. Perhaps they should have had the cardio moves on the Learn and Burn section or maybe she could have broken down each step at a slower pace."
3,injured my back on this one,"I like the original firm time crunch better than this one (the one made in the 80's).This is an OK workout, except it has military dead lifts. Against my better judgment, I did the military dead lifts on this on injured my lower back on the first trial of this video.So, if you are prone to lower back problems, I'd either not get this one or skip the dead lifts."
3,Disappointed,"I ordered this video because I loved Get Chisel'd with Rebekah. But I was disappointed... I'm not saying is bad workout, but, It's just ok. The cardio segments are way to hard to keep up with! All I did was follow the first moves and kept doing those ones because it gets very difficult follow every single one of them. Even Rebekah's voice sounds desperate at one point she says: ONE SINGLE, ONE DOUBLE!! And you can tell by her voice it was hard for her to do.This workout is just not for me, but if you like dancy workouts, you may want to give it a try. I plan on putting this DVD on the shelf... and if I do it once or twice, I'll just make my own cardio routine during the cardio segments."
3,Not the best Firm DVD,"I have about 10 Firm DVDs and I hardly ever use this one, because, as noted by a few other people, it is hard to learn and follow. I am familiar with the terminology and basic moves used by the Firm and usually when I get a new workout, it takes a few times through for me to get the routine, so I tried it several times. Each time I felt really frustrated by the cueing and how fast the moves were added and changed and how few repetitions were done before the move was changed. If you can figure it out and keep up, it's a decent workout, but the others that are less frustrating are the ones I'm motivated to pull out."
2,Too much time wasted,"I bought this video based on the many positive reviews. It's not bad... IF you have a LOT of extra time to learn the moves. Generally I can keep up with changes... but not so many, so quickly. I like more of a 'lets get down to business' kind of workout. In the time it takes to learn the moves and her timing I could have had a few good workouts. If you want to just get to work, and not have a bunch of fru-fru moves to learn before hand, this isn't a dvd for you. If you like lots of changes, and can keep up, go ahead. I'm sure once you get the hang of it, it's probably pretty good."
2,Total Body Frustration,"I'd used videos from The Firm before and read good reviews about this particular one, so was excited when it arrived in the mail. Maybe the trick is to use it many times, but my first run through was a real disappointment. The choreography is so complex that I spent half the time exasperated, trying to figure out what the instructor was doing. Funny thing was, even she and her ""co-teachers"" seemed lost or confused at points. If I had a few workout sessions (or other time in my life) to spend trying to get the choreography down, this might turn out to be a good video. But I don't. So I think it will go in the ""giveaway"" bag."
1,Disappointed,"I am very disappointed with this buy. The power adapter shuts down after 5 minutes, I have complete all the trouble shooting that was suggested, but it continues to shut down after 5 minutes thus not completing the charge."
5,Great DVD,Love this DVD and it came as advertised with no flaws. Plays great and packaging was perfect to get it here safely.
4,Kids love these tins,"The graphics on this tin are very sweet and our kids (ages 1 1/2 yrs and 3 1/2 yrs) play with this almost every day. We have a few Haba tins and they make our Kidkraft play kitchen look very fun and happy. The tin is small in scale, but as described and well sized for little hands. Our kids put play food, pompoms and Play-doh creations in this tin and it's a perfect prop for tea parties. I plan to buy others in different designs."
3,Product didn't have subtitles like description said,"But it is still possible to somewhat understand from the description, and just watching the images. One thing to note is that until the very last 15 minutes or so, the movie looks like a little bit better than what is shown on the scifi channels. i.e. the camera and special effects are a bit awkward, and fake looking at a lot of the times. But the last 20 minutes look really cool, a bit like dumbed down LOTR effects, but 30 times better than scifi channel special effects."
5,Dont Think it Can be Met,"This is a very good album. It is worth the money to buy it. But it is so good that when the Bangers put there next out it cannot be met or be as good as this, the first of the albums."
5,Tight Cd,"THis is a party from intro to outro a total head bobbing cd. With guest appearance by YoungBloodz,Juvenille,Lil Flip. its put together so good it will make you stand up and dance for shure. I smoke,I drank is by far the new antheme for the South.

5,them boyz are on fi-------------------------re!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,get this cd cause it slamin of the heezzzzzzy. one of the best
3,"Great helmet, bad pad orientation","This is a good helmet for the money. It fits my head like a glove (well, like a hat, really). I found it helpful to know that Giro helmets generally fit people with a more round head around the hat band, whereas Bell helmets are better for folks with a more oval shaped head.One issue that will keep me from buying another one is the pads. They are oriented longitudinally so that sweat runs down from the top of the head and is channeled to drip right into my eyes. The Limar helmet I had before this one avoided this by putting a front pad across the forehead laterally with its low points depositing the sweat outside of the eye area."

5,Good Product - Poor Delivery,"The Giro Monza helmet provides excellent protection while delivering stylish comfort. Of all the helmets tired at local shops, the Giro Monza is one of the best.We purchased one of the Giro Monza helmets at a local shop. The helment came with extra pads to be used as inserts around the strap mechanism. The helmet we received from Amazon was missing the insert pads and the warranty/installation pamphlet that we received with the helmet purchased from our local shop. Perhaps the Amazon competitive pricing is through eliminating pieces of the standard package. Also note, the Amazon order came as if the Helmet had been stored in a warehouse (dusty) for a long period of time."
4,"Personal and entertaining, a good geek read","This book is best read as the third in Cleo's series of rich yet exotic life experiences. As with the other two books, here we have a woman whose looks and charm have allowed her to squeak through a whole host of interesting experiences that, by now, should have left her dead, diseased, or incapacitated. But fortunately for us, we have this MUD & VR-centric collection of experiences that are refreshing, fun and immersive from this woman's community-centric point of view - and a very honest take on the (intended and unintended) hypocricies of love online."
2,"Ho-Hum, another Odzer book","Cleo Odzer, Phd, proves that in America these days, almost anyone with a pulse can call themselves a ""Phd."" Her writing style is dull, and her honesty doubtful - but her choice of subjects are always interesting."
1,Not as shown in the picture!,"This tank is a LOT longer than the one shown on the model in the photo, the length does not end at the waist as shown, the tank top hem lands mid-thigh. I am not a short person, I am 6'3"", so the problem is not that I am too short for the size (XL)."
4,Nice product,"I am 6-foot tall, I bought 2 of these in large and the hems end on mid-buttock, normal for most shirts. Nice product as described. These are not form-fit like the Under Armor shirts so I gave it a 4 instead of 5-star. Under $8, you can't do better at TJMaxx."
3,"Neat Idea, Needs Adjustbility","I think that this CD Holder would be perfect if it were adjustable. The construction seems to be of high quality, and it holds on to the disks well. (No fear of going around a sharp turn and experiencing a hailstorm of shiny round disks...)Maybe they could just put some elastic on the joint portion to make it work for everyone! Alas, I am back to the cardboard box banging around in the floor of my car."
2,I give up,"I give up i guess. sizzla put out some albums that shot him straight to the top, and now after buying his last few and hearing that this was ""the one"" and that sizzla is back i was unpleasantly surprised. if you want good sizzla for your money go buy ""black woman and child, good ways, freedom cry, or royal son of ethiopia"". this album has one good song in my opinion, track one. not enough to make an album. throw on any of the others i just mentioned and let them play all the way through. play this current album and you will offend the people around you. too much cursing and senseless lyrics as well, like ""we dont give a f@#k we just smoke the marijuana"", derr sizzla. blessinigs flow mr kalanji and much respect for an artist experimenting, but enough experimenting allready. that beinig said sizzla is in my opinion still one of the top artists out of jamaica, but not since royal son of ethiopia."
4,A very pretty lamp for a very reasonable price.,"I like the combination of brass + chrome, helped us create a good balance (all the things in the bathroom where brass, we are trying to move away from it... but some items are too hard to change!)."
4,Really Good Book....Go Out and Get It Today!,"This is the second book that I have read from Montecino...this was his first book that he ever wrote apparently...and it was excellent! The characters were well done...I felt so bad for one particular character...Esther....she goes through so much...the only fault that I found was that I wish that the author would have focused a bit more on the relationship between Esther and Clarke Johnson....otherwise the book was great! Heartstopping...kept me guessing what was going to happen next....and in some parts it definately throws you for a few spins! I am going to read ""Big Time"" now...which is also by Montecino...... Happy Reading to all!"
1,One of the Junk Heap Models,"I needed something compact for a second room and this seemed to cover all the bases. Unfortunately, it was very complicated to use and had very little in the way of front face indicators. If you're looking for a counter or clock, you're out of luck!The playback quality is mediocre at best and there have been some read issues with home movie DVD's. The clincher is that two and a half months into use it's now starting to make squeaky noises from the VCR side of the deck.I expect this one to meet the local junk heap within a year and I won't be playing anything I wouldn't mind shredding in it."
2,Complicated!,"Setup for cable is quick and easy through your cable box. However, picture quality during dvd play is terrible due to constant vertical waves, but does not occur when you're watching cable television run through the player. Unlike my previous Samsung dvd/vcr player, you have to add the 3-outlet video component cables PLUS a pair of audio cables to get decent a/v from dvds. Then you have to remember to switch back to ""tv"" component to watch cable tv. Has an internal clock for recording, but no clock display. Item is new, not remanufactured. On the plus side, dvds that ""skipped"" on my previous dvd/vcr player do NOT skip on the Panasonic."
5,Very satisfied,"I could have bought a cheeper unit, but I didn't like the poor reviews other players got. I use this unit to view my store bought VCRs and DVDs and it works perfectly. This is an extremely complex piece of electronics equipment and the user manual can be quite itimidating. It was written by ""techno geeks"" for ""techno geeks"". However, you don't have to be intimidated. I could re-write the manual for someone like me in a single sentence; ""Run the cables from the unit to your TV (a simple task), then press VCR if you want to watch a VCR, or press DVD if you want to watch a DVD. Then press ""play"". I would buy this same unit again if I needed another one."
5,Excellent Buy,"We used this book in school, decided to purchase it for my younger sister when she took her classes. Quick delivery and a good reference tool."
3,Not So Compact!,A functionaly dictionary but it measures 8.5 x 5.5 and is 1.75 inches thick! Not nearly as compact as I was hoping. The New World Spanish/English dictionary is only 1/4 inch more thick than this dictionary (The New World is 2 inches thick).
1,"Decent concept, but poor execution","The controls on the front of this device are barely tactile and quickly become too slippery to use. The case feels cheap, and when I'm squeezing with all my might to hold onto the thing because the controls are too slick, I'm afraid I'll crack the thing open. Save your money."
4,"Great pictures, dated and simplistic analysis","First, the good:This book provides a well organized summary of the world as the Vikings knew it with great illustrations of the land, of activities, and of archaeological finds. The pictures help bring to live a greater amount of the past than many other books do.The downside however is that the analysis which goes along with the illustrations was largely dated even when the book was published (for example the preference they give to the Saga of Erik the Red over the Greenlanders' Saga), and many areas seem simplistic based on advances in the field today (in particular analysis of mythic traditions). For the beginner asking ""who were the Vikings"" the analysis is probably adequate, but for an advanced student the pictures are where the value lies.All in all, I think this is a book worth having, though."
5,From the author,"I wrote this book for people who are tired of hate politics and are looking for ways to move America forward. It examines explosive social issues such as abortion, gay marriage and sex education from various angles, using research to uncover misinformation and misconceptions while providing commonsense solutions that can help us realize our potential and help turn our country around."
5,If you need a pool filtration system,"If you have need for a swimming pool filtration system, this is the one. When we installed our above ground pool in 1994 this D.E. Filtration system is what we chose. In the 15 years that it was in operation the only thing we had to replace was the check valve on the return to pool side. We are replacing our old system with the same one we chose 16 years ago this April. The only reason we are replacing the filter is while doing routine maintenance I broke a part that cannot be serviced.You cannot go wrong with this system if you follow the easy instructions and do the routine maintenance (also easy). You will have many years of crystal clean pool water and your friends that don't have pools of their own will flock to use yours."
4,very pleased,"We were very happy to get this right away, as temperatures were rising here in TX and needed to start prepping for opening of our pool. Amazon had the lowest price for this product and shipped the fastest. The filter was padded and wrapped so it arrived in GREAT shape with all the pieces. Now we're ready to go...THANKS!"
4,Haward EC50 filter,"Excellent price, quick shipping, quality product. They even included a drain valve which I did not know came with it. That's a 20.00 item by itself. Installed it on inground pool. It's been running for 3 weeks working awsome. Very happy with this product."
1,Buyer Beware !!!!,"I purchased this product to replace an aging Hayward system I had. The picture showed me exactly what I needed, or so I thought. The delivery was made and I only got one box containing the canister. Looking at the invoice I saw for the first time "" PLS TELL CUSTOMER-FILTER ONLY"". Nowhere in the item description did it say "" filter only"" as the picture showed more than that. I called the supplier ""In THE SWIM"" and was told they understood my situation. I was asked to hold while they talked to their manager. They returned offering me to spend another $280+ dollars for the other part shown in thier advertised picture. Check out the link below to see what I mean.http://www.amazon.com/Hayward-EC50AC-Perflex-Extended-Cycle-Above-Ground/dp/B000EVOM5Y/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"
4,Pool filter replacement,"What can I say? Buying this from Amazon was about half the price of buying it in a local store, and for only $3.99 got it overnight with Amazon Prime membership. CANNOT BEAT THIS ANYWHERE LOCALLY!CONS;Instructions were horrible-do not know who wrote them but the person never used or even saw this filter! So read what little there is many times, plan out what you are going to do several times before actually installing or using it. Such things as cleaning were horribly described.PROS;Works fantastically!"
1,Junk - Nothing but trouble,"I have had mine for one year now, and it developed a rattle inside. Took it apart to discover plastic pieces inside the fingers are broken and rattle.. Also every inside bolt ,washer ,and clip was very corroded and comming apart. So I had to completely take this thing apart and replace the hardware. Who would make a filter inside with steel bolts that would rust in one year ? Getting the big rubber seal back on is very hard and cost $60 bucks for a replacement.They claim you never have to back flush. Thats not true. Where do you think all that accumulated dirt is going to go ? Dont take this thing apart ,cause youre asking for trouble. The filter works fine, just the quality stinks. In hind sight I would buy a big carterage filter instead. Up date - DE getting now in pool. This filter after 1 1/2 years is now junk. Don't Buy."
5,Hayward Pool Filter,"I was skeptical to switch to a D.E. filter but after many frustrating years with my old sand filter I made the change. Best thing I could have done...The filter arrived even earlier than I expected and was exactly as advertised. Installation was a very easy and took less than 30 min.The constant maintenance everybody warned me about with a D.E. filter turns out to be virtually nonexistent. Over the past two months the only thing I have had to do is add the earth (when I first installed it), and bump the handle a few times after the first few weeks. Other than that I just rely on an automatic timer to turn it on and off.The best part is just how efficient this thing is. I have only been running it half as long as my old filter and the pool is the cleanest it has ever been. I love this thing, recommend it to anyone."
2,Product Update,"This product was purchased as shown. Hpowever, the product has been updated and the new product does not have this color tube and the applicator end is snub nosed instead of the old better long pointed end. It is more difficult to deliver the glue to the item you are repairing. The seller was advised by me to show the new product with its new packaging in the orange tube."
3,Campaign Series No. 5 with a new cover,"If you own Osprey's Campaign Series No. 5, Ardenne 1944, you don't need to buy this one. Not a bad one though, 3 stars."
4,Pretty Good,"I watched Pokemon as a kid so I was excited for these DVD's and they didnt disappoint. Im in college and all my friends bug me to watch them. The only complaint I have is that some of the episodes arent centered around the Pokemon they claim to be. The Mudkip disc has an episode called ""Turning Over a Nuzleaf"" which really only featured Mudkip walking with the group of other Pokemon, if anything it was a Treecko or Corphish episode. However, they are all really great discs and should be a must have for anyone who remembers playing Pokemon Yellow or Gold and Silver even."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME,"I absolutely LOVED this movie and highly, highly recommend it to ANYONE who has never seen it. I'm not a huge fan of Def Leppard and knew absolutely nothing about them...in fact I didn't even knew they were a British Band...yeah, yeah I know. But I found the movie to be very entertaining as well as informative. Even if you don't care for there music, still give it a try...you'll find yourself pleasantly surprised. Except for a concert scene at the end, very little of there music is played throughout the movie, with the focus being more on the band members, their private lives, and personal struggles and tragedies."
5,This a MUST for all Leppard Fans!!,"This is really good movie, every DL fan should own it. It starts from the beginning, including the old drummer, and it ends at the peak of Hysteria.DEF LEPPARD IS THE GREATEST BAND GOD EVER MADE!!!"
4,Def Leppard Hysteria the Movie,"I thought this movie was really good but honestly I was hoping that it would go into further detail about when Steve Clark passed away but it didnt but overall it was good! The movie starts out right away when the drummer Rick Allen got into a car wreck so right off the bat it has action. It shows all the detail on what the band had to go through just to get where they are today and that is the best rock and roll band in the world...in my book anyway!!And if you are a true Def Leppard fan as I am, then this movie will leave you very satisfied and wanting to watch it over and over again as i do. Thank you amazon and I will be ordering from you again shortly. Again Thanks!!Alicia Martinez"
4,"Great Story, Good watch.","Very good, I dont know how true everything is.Only Def Leppard can tell us,but it was entertaining. They jam a little in movie."
4,A DIFFERENT KIND OF LOVE STORY,"If you love wonderful writing and enjoy suffering along with your protagonist, PAPER LOVERS is a good choice for you. Ms. Knadle has crafted a romance novel about the romance genre that satisfied this romance hater. Go figure. Read this novel in a book group or at least with a friend so you can discuss (or fistfight) over the moral question."
2,Not happy.,"Please spend more money on a pair of quality speakers like Polk, JL, Infinity and don't go cheap or else your system will be sounding as cheap also. Lesson learned... just don't be cheap and steer away from these speakers."
5,Simply The Best,"To keep it plain and simple, this is the best strap retention system out there. Installation couldn't be easier for most instruments, and it is a product that just works as it is supposed to. I use these on all my electrics. I don't use them on my acoustic guitars because strap retention doesn't seem to be as much a problem, but I see no reason why they wouldn't work for acoustic applications also.I'll take these over Schaller's any day!"
3,A book for novice,I'd only recommend this book to novices only. This book has broad but brief coverage on various kinds of martial arts which might be entertaining to some. The training action photos seem fairly elementary; the lessons/exercises are relatively basic but sometimes interesting.
4,A Haunting Book,"This is a touching book. It's crafted, without the flash and dash of a tv-movie-of-the-week-novelization. You will remember this one. It conveys real human feelings, and the passage of time. How hard it must have been back then; what a shocking crime! It's wonderful that this book was written."
2,Not Very Detailed,"While this book is interesting in that the author is the cousin of the victim, the crime details are extremely sparse. The crime itself is covered in about 1 1/2 pages, the recovery of the body is less than that. In all this is more a memoir about a period of time in Odessa Texas. If you are looking for a detailed true crime book on this murder, you most likely will be left wanting more."
4,Those were the days,"If you're interested in 'the old days' this is a good read. It makes me shiver to remember, because I was there, too; I was a '60 OHS graduate and knew Betty. Williams does a good thing by ""standing up for her"" now. He also captures the time and place, which are pretty interesting in their own right. In my own small way I tried to remember her, too, in my novel WALKING DUNES, which is focused on 1959 teens in Odessa.I wanted to understand why people weren't more outraged. It's OP but easily available cheap online. If u like his bk you'll like mine; I was trying to understand what in the world the guys were thinking in those days. (I'm female.)"
5,"Washed in the Blood ... in Odessa, Texas","Shelton Williams has written a personal account of the ""Kiss and Kill"" murder case and life Odessa, Texas in 1962. In a book that's hard to put down, Shelly opens his soul, as not many have the courage to do, to tell the story of the murder of his 17-year-old cousin. He asked the questions never asked, why was she murdered, did she want to die and why was her killer set free? It is a sensitive and telling piece on growing up in Odessa and how this famed murder case made some fortunes and shaped the lives of others, including his own."
4,"Nice lightweight tripod, fully replaceable head","I ordered the Bogen 785B tripod as a small, lightweight travel tripod, but it didn't quite meet my needs. The Ultra Maxi F tripod from Velbon is a much better fit. It is listed to support up to 5lbs, and works well with my Canon Digital Rebel XTi.My favorite feature of this tripod is the head. The Maxi F comes with a Pan & Tilt head (PHD-31Q) which is easy to use. The head is mounted on a split center column, the split is so that the tripod can be lowered to put the camera within 6 inches of the ground. This also allows the entire center column to be removed for easier packing, or to be flipped upside-down for straight-down shots. The best part, though, is that the Pan & Tilt head can be removed from the center column, and replaced with a ball head of your choosing that has a compatible mounting screw."
5,Great Collection and fast delivery!,"This is a great series - - it really sparked my interest in manga and anime. Growing up with Godzilla and company, I have always been a fan of Japanese cinema. I recommend the Hell Girl series to anyone into Japanese pop culture."
1,Does not Register temp accurately,I recently bought this thermometer. I have used it twice to froth milk for a latte. It does not accurately read. It never falls below the 70 degree temp. And when frothing the milk. It sat at 70 degrees. Then jumps to 120. There is no incremental increase. I was really disappointed this morning when using it as it was the only the second time I used it. I wish I had bought another
3,"Good exercise, but too long","This was going to be used for patients to relax, but it is over an hour long, which is too long for most patients. Only one lasted the whole hour. Plus the area we use is too small to allow the positions. Everyone was favorable about the content."
3,Hard to understand with thick accent.,"If you can understand Rodney's thick accent, then you may enjoy this tape. However, I could barely understand him- thus making me feel frustrated rather than relaxed."
1,Nonstop Rivera isn't a good thing in this case...,"I either love a Robbie Rivera mix or hate it, with no in-betweens. He has a harder edge sometimes, and then there's the repetitive, uninteresting mostly instrumental funk house mixes like this one. If you love everything he does, you'll want this, if you're not into the dubby fun/disco house like this, then I don't recommend it. Track times:1. flawless (4:31)2. calling all cars (3:45)3. metalhead (6:42)4. you can't change my ways (5:44)5. Jetfunk (5:07)6. the light (6:06)7. Smoke machine (9:15)8. letting ya mind go (4:11)9. play to win (6:42)10. fantasy girl (5:27)11. rheinkraft (4:47)12. pixels (6:59)"
1,The worst source of learning ever!!!,"This CD is aweful. I have never seen such a horrible language product. The content is veeery poor. It doesn't even include the alphabet. It has no grammar. If you are trying to learn Bulgarian, the only result will be confusion. It also loads quite slowly. Don't buy this product."
4,Great story!,"Lee Martin has written characters that almost everyone can relate to. I had never heard of Quakertown despite living near Denton for most of my life. I looked up info on the web, and sure enough it did exist. (My mom hadn't heard of the town either.) But I am sure that there are many other towns that the same (or similar) thing happened."
5,A Little Practical...A Little Feminist... A Little Needed,"At first I was a little insulted that ""It's Only Money"" was subtitled ""A Primer for Women."" I had a hard time imagining that such a book would be directed at men.Then I noticed that the author (Allison Acken) is a Ph.D. who had trouble learning to handle money herself. That piqued my interest.Then--when I opened the book--I noticed all the little facts about the disparity between women and men and their finances. That's when I decided that women darn right NEED this book more than men.I grew up knowing how to manage money but I thought I'd review it. I'm here to tell you that even if you know what to do with a quarter, you'll probably learn something from this book you didn't already know.Not only that; This is fun reading.Carolyn Howard-Johnson, author of ""This is the Place"""
4,England's Second Greatest Detective?,"Fans of the Sherlock Holmes stories will know Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard. Conan Doyle never gave him much to do except take the credit when Holmes solved the case but now he's finally getting his due. This book is apparently the latest in a lengthy series but the first I've seen. I will definitely seek out the others. In addition to being a fair and twisty mystery it is also a very funny comedy, reminiscent of Monty Python or Terry Pratchett. There are even a few irrereverent references to the Great Detective and his creator. All in all a good read even if you're not a Holmes fan."
4,Great little light.,"This little Paterson Safelight throws more darkroom light than you can imagine for it's size. I wish only that it was made of metal and glass like all the old darkroom equiptment however, should you need to take the darkroom out of your house and use it on the road... this is the greatest little suitcase darkroom light offered. I will be taking it on the road eventually in my 1958 Airstream Trailer and it is perfect. Compact; Light and usefull. Enjoy this light if you get her but handle her carefully she is so light weight that you can move her very quickly."
4,Valentina Ponomareva,"This CD would appeal to those who enjoy Russian music, and especially Russian folk or gypsy music. These songs are traditional, and are all sung in the Russian language.Valentina Ponomareva has a clear and strong voice, and sings with great emotion. I found her selection of songs to be interesting. there were the familiar songs such as Dark Eyes (ochi chyorniye), and others that were less common.I like the way that Valentina puts her emotions into her singing. For instance, the song ""Day and Night"" (Tolko raz, bivayet vzhizni stretche) is a sad song of unrequited love, poignant in its own right. When Valentina belts it out, it becomes a genuine tear-jerker. I like how she can wring every last bit of feeling from the songs she sings."
4,Use the DVI Interface,"I selected this TV because of the size. This set is designed to be less wide than most 32"" sets so it fit perfectly into my cabinet. Delivery was great. The scheduling was easy and two guys delivered it into the house and down the stairs (this baby is heavy).Be sure you can use the DVI interface for input to this TV. When I first hooked it up to my high definition cable box via component video the HD channels were a little wavy around the edges. Not bad, but noticable. Once I purchased a DVI cable (100 bucks!) and hooked it up via DVI the picture on this set was pefect. Looks fantastic.One thing to watch out for is that the only S-Video input is on the side and if you have the set in a cabinet you can't access it."
1,"Supposed to be great, Mine is DOA","I purchased this set after considerable research and glowing reviews at the AVS Forum. Price from Amazon was best I could find, and set arrived quickly and appeared to be in perfect condition.Upon plugging it in, all the set would do is click constantly. No picture, no sound, no nothing.A call to Samsung resulted in immediately getting a local repair facility's name and phone number, only to have the information rescinded when they realized I had an HDTV product. Instead I was told I would receive a ""higher level"" of service, and an agent would contact me within 2 days. Well, it has been 5 days, three calls by me, and no calls from Samsung. An E-Mail to Amazon requesting assistance in obtaining support yielded a short note suggesting I ""check the troubleshooting portion of the manual"", then call Samsung.Gee thanks, Amazon.If this ever gets resolved, I'll post the results, but for now I'd suggest avoiding this product."
3,MEH. NHL's SUPPOSEDLY GREATEST MOMENTS,"STOP! I've seen that. STOP! I've seen that. STOP! I've seen that. Get the picture?But seriously, enough with the Mario Lemieux hightlights. The man was a puck hog."
2,Cookies Are Not Nearly As Good As At The Mall,I bought this book with the high hopes of being able to duplicate the cookies sold at the Mrs. Fields stores in the malls. The cook book does not produce mall quality cookies. I've tried several of the cookes from this cook book and ALL are disappointing. Don't bother with this book. Betty Crocker's cook books have better cookie recipes.
4,Kid's Bake 'Em Cookies are great!,"My son is allergic to eggs and milk, so when I found this recipe, I was elated! I substituted the butter for shortening, and they turned out really good! Moist and chewy! I think I will try adding some brown sugar to them next time for a little twist, though.I have made the Lacy Oatmeal cookies too (not for my son) and they are great.I recommend this book, because it's easy to follow and the recipes never are complicated."
3,Two much sugar!!!,"It is a book you enjoy if you are wondering what cookies to bake. The recipes a well explained, nicely pictured and easy to follow so I tried quite a few. But after the first outcomes I decided to bake the next ones using only the half amount of the indicated sweet ingredients as even my children complained about the overwhelming sweetness of this cookies!"
5,Love this cookbook,This is a favorite cookbook of mine. The recipes are easy to follow and come out perfectly every time. Some of our favorites are the gingerbread cookies and sugar cookies. The only problem is keeping them around. I also love the apple pie recipe. It's the best homemade apple pie I've ever tasted.
1,failure,"I bought this book with the expectation of being able to produce cookies similar to the exceptional Mrs. Fields cookies sold in stores. Unfortunately, not only did I not come close to the taste of Mrs. Field cookies, the finished products were either too dense or burned at the bottom. The cooking time instructed in the book is way too long, and the readers are misled into creaming the batter at medium speed, which I eventually found out in another cookbook causes the cookies to puff and fall as they bake. I also discovered upon further experimentation that the temperature recommended for baking the cookies are not high enough, thus causing the cookies to spread. This cookbook is completely furstrating and should not be recommended to aspiring bakers. You are better off investing in more expensive cookbooks such as Bo Friberg's Professional Pastry Chef and Rose Levy's Cake Bible."
5,This is a MUST have for moms.,"I LOVE this cookbook. I use it all the time, The cookies are wonderful My daughters love the the chocolate, marshmallow filled cookies. MUST HAVE for all moms"
5,Simply the best,This is absolutely the best cookie book I have ever owned (and I own a lot). I have yet to make a bad recipe.
2,not the cookies in the mall,"I haven't seen Mrs Fields cookies at the mall for the longest time and thought they went out of business so I was excited about getting this book. I especially bought the book for the white chocolate macadamia nut cookie. Well, it wasn't in there. I found recipes on the net and on the back of the white chocolate chip packaging. Pretty much a waste of money for my purposes. The recipes seem like good but generic cookie recipes that one can easily Google and get, with reviews so you know if they are good or bad which you won't get with this book."
1,An incredibly basic review - -,"If you watch solar commercials on TV you will understand the depth of this book. Want to figure out if Solar Electric is *Really* a good idea for you? This isn't the book. There's a bunch of cheerleading for the concept but no real details to give you the basis for deciding.If you want to go solar because it's 'green' then skip this book - the authors think so too and you already know enough to proceed. If you want to determine if it's cost effective - buy something else.On the other hand, there are a bunch of ideas I hadn't run into - how to use solar power to light your house number - how to bake beans in the backyard without using the stove, etc. You might like it for those insights!"
2,Disappointing Overview of Solar,I purchased this book as a resource at the start of the design phase of our custom home. I read it and never opened it again. It simply lacks the depth in any area to be useful and frankly seemed very dated to me despite the 2002 copyright. The key flaw for me is the book seems more like a lightly annotated outline of a huge number of solar applications than a book that would increase my knowledge.
5,Only the best from Fred and Ginger,"Have been watching Astaire and Rogers on T.V., TCM, tape and DVD since before cable or satellite. Bought this collection and the other half of their film collection because it was a little more than half what the complete collection is going for now. If you pick the right time to order the complete collection or the two collections that have the same films included, you can shoot for a deal. Fred Astaire was a perfectionist and Ginger Rogers an accomplished actress before joining him. I believe you will truly enjoy this collection, and do not forget to purchase the other one."
5,Astaire & Rogers Collection vol.2,"The collection is superb, their joy in the dance is so easy to catch. I appreciate all my favorites in one box."
2,Disappointed,"The packaging online looked like the figures were larger. To my dismay, they were tiny. They are about 2 inches tall. I was hoping at least 4 or 5. Oh well, I'll be careful next time."
1,Unbelievable,Want to know who's responsible for the post-modern nonsense that got us where we are? It's Derrida and Habermas.
5,Resurgance cleanser - AMAZING,I am at the tale end of menopause (I hope). At the age of 54 I have been having raging hormones all over my face. I couldn't get my skin under control. After suffering for 90 days I decided to order Murad Resurgence from Amazon. I don't like being forced into ordering auto ship that is why I come to Amazon. The Cleanser is AMAZING. My skin looks great and feels great. Not dry or greasy. I recommend this product to anyone who needs a great cleanser.
1,It could be much better!,"I thought I was almost a fan of Kate DiCamillo. ""Stories are light"", she once said. But not this one. My eight-year-old daughter and I were so disappointed after we finished this book, it's totally not what we expected; we don't see any light at all.It looks the author was trying to tell us some things, such as memories, true emotions and animals can't be locked up forever. The message seems profound, but the way it delivered was lack of light. The worst part which I cannot bear is the ending -- the tiger is dead. And all characters don't seem to have a happier life. Nothing interesting. Nothing exciting. Nothing hopeful. I find myself ended up with a heavy heart:-(Also, there're other issues in the book, such as. The way to deal with bullies. Fighting at school. Communication between parents and kidsI don't recommend this book."
2,The Tiger Sleeping,"While this is a wonderful book, apparently the best way to ruin it is to let Dylan Baker read it. While he drones on and on in a mesmerizing monotone that gives the distinct impression that he'd rather be somewhere else, your attention wanders to anything but the wonderful story he's reading. There is no emotion or character whatsoever. Character's lines that should be emotional and heartfelt are instead read with whimsy, as though he wasn't even paying attention to the story he was reading. If you want to enjoy this story, skip the audio version and read the book for yourself."
4,An intriquing story --,"DiCamillo's second effort does not have the ligntness of the wonderful Because of Winn-Dixie, but seems to purposely be a bit darker in character. The book is wonderfully written to make readers think of the cages imposed upon us all by external and internal forces. The characters are wonderfully drawn in lyrical prose that stirs the readers imagination. I was sorry to see the book end, and I look forward to reading more of Ms. DiCamillo's work."
5,Friendship Story,"I give this book The Tiger Rising by Kate DiCamillo five stars. This book is about a boy named Rob. Rob lives in a small motel in Florida. He moved there with his dad after his mom died. Rob has a disease on his legs and everyone at school bullies him because of it. Then one day he's walking to the bus stop and he sees a real tiger trapped in a cage pacing back and forth. The same day he meets a girl named Sistine who is named after the Sistine Chapel. Read this exciting and tragic book to find out about the tiger, and Rob and Sistine's everlasting friendship!"
4,Vivid Writing!,"This book touched my heart. The characterizations were beautifully drawn. I love the way Rob and Sistene overcame a shaky start to develop a very strong bond. At the beginning of the book Sistene would be very harsh to Rob, any questions he would have for her were answered in a combative tone. But their friendship grew, culminating in her unabashed admiration for one of Rob's wood carvings. Finally, I'll say that the message of this book was that friendship comes in all types of packages. I loved this book!"
3,It's okay,"This book was not nearly as good as I expected. It is very large printed, spaced, and is not very captivating. I would not recommend it to a friend :/"
2,Not the Best,"This isn't the worst book I ever read, but it isn't even close to being what I would describe as good. I am a 5th grade teacher, and I love to read books that I may use in my classroom as a read-aloud or in a literature circle. I wouldn't use this one for either.The whole story spans about 5 days. In those 5 days, Rob and Sistine don't really solve any of their problems. The characters are poorly developed, and the plot is rushed. I don't know how this book ever was a National Book Award Finalist."
3,Tiger Rising,OKAY IM GOING TO START OUT WITH.IF I LIKE THE BOOK OR NOT . I LIKE THE BOOK CAUSE .IT SPOOK TO ME ABOUT THE WILD LIFE .I HEARD THAT IT IS DANGEROUS.AND YOU COLD GET KILD OUT THERE IN THE WILD LIFE.OKAY NOW IM WRITING PART TWO.PART TWO SAYS HOW SHE FELT ABOUT THE WILD LIFE . IT SEEMS LIKE IN HERLIFE LIKE .SHE NOWS HOW TO TAKE CARE OF HER SELF.SINCE SHE HAS A TIGER.NOW IM WRITING MY FINALE PARAGRAPH.THIS PARAGRAPH IS GOING TO BE ABOUT HOW SHE ENDED UP SHE ENDED UP PRETTY GOOD AT THE ENDED OF THE BOOK .SHE HAS NO FEAR OF ANYTHING..
3,Not That Much To It,This book was mostly just about a tiger locked up in a cage in the woods behind the kentucky Star Motel.A boy named Rob Horton(main chaacter) meets a girl named Sistine and tries to set it free. But the Tiger is owned by the owner of the Kentucky Star Hotel.I liked it but there was not much to it. Every chapter just didn't feel that good of writing for a Finalist Book. If you are looking for a quick book to read(finished it in 2 days)Then this is the book for you. -ERIK P.S. I recommend this book for 9 and 10 year olds.
3,the boook is ful of adventure.,The book is okay I guess it could use a little more deatail. And a happier ending like roberts Dad was happy that his son was safe with him having tiger. Instead of the tiger gets shoot in the head and Robert beating his dad with his fist Could use a diffrent name for Beauchamp like Wariior or Cody. but I will have to give that is sort of adventurests and alot beter endind at the very end i mean come that his dad said son there is not a cloud in the sky. I would think that as robert hurried to the forest from school he had a 5 mile walk ahead but knowing that the tiger would be there it only semmed like 4 minutes. But I think that athour could of put more effrot into it most athours write like to 300 pages like a book I have read before it had at least 234 pages. One of Kate dicarmillo has written books with alot more pages.Amanda from califroina10 years old
3,A Tiger and Two Children,"Have you ever heard of the book The Tiger Rising? It's about Rob and Sistine,two very young childern locked away in a world of lies.They meet up and find a tiger locked up in a cage right in the back of the motel.The two kids want to let it go and they have the keys to the cage.Would you let the tiger go? I wouldn't. If I were you, I'd read this book.The Tiger Rising teaches a good lesson and story, so I would recommend it as a good read."
4,Children of the Woods,"The Tiger Rising is a very good book. It's about a boy and a girl named Robert and Sistine. Rob is a poor boy who lives with his father in a motel called the Kentucky Star. Rob's father works for the motel owner Beauchamp, and his father gets paid very little. Sistine is a stubborn girl that always gets in fights at school and thinks her dad is going to come and get her. The best part in the story is when a Rob gets the job to feed the tiger. I would recommend this book to all ages."
4,Poetic Beauty,"So many of these characters are cursed with ugliness, whether it's inward ugliness like selfishness, anger, or cowardness or whether it's outward ugliness like the main character who's legs are covered in a hideous rash. However, the despite the ugliness of it's characters, all the characters are still vulnerable. The dialogue in this book is raw and filled with poor grammar and Southern slang. The ending is emotional and far from sugar coated. From what I've said here, this book wouldn't seem as beautiful as it really is. The truth is that this book is gorgeous. While reading it, I wasn't sure I'd like it or not... but in the end I realized that the symbolism and honesty of this story made it into a story that flowed like one big beautiful poem."
5,The Tiger Rising,"In the book The Tiger Rising a boy named Rob Horton is just getting adapted to the new changes that has been happening in his life. Rob has been lonely ever since he has moved to a new town and when his mom pasted away. All Rob really wants is a friend or two, but instead he keeps getting bullied.I really liked this book because it was really about his friendship with a girl named Sistine Bailey. When Rob made a friend, Sistine was a good friend because they were always going on adventures and doing other things.The author of this book wrote it with great detail. There is so much detail that it feels like I am with the characters. That is why detail is important in this book. By having detail it makes the characters come to life.I recommend this book because it is every thing I said, and more. It has good friendships,adventures, great detail, and much more."
4,The Power of Friendship,"An adult reader, I had just finished reading a news story of the young shooter at Santana High School when I opened Kate's Tiger Rising. I was struck by the similarities of that young shooter and Kate's Rob: They were similar in age and each had moved to a new school, where each encountered taunts and ridicule; each had a emotionally distant father and a physically absent mother; each household held guns; each boy kept much pain deep inside. Where the shooter's friendships offered too little, Rob was blessed with a powerful friendship through which he healed himself and perhaps his father as well.This story has haunted me ever since.Yes, it's a darker tale than Di Camillo's Winn Dixie, but still hopeful and a testament to the kind of friendship we would wish for all our children."
3,A moms view...too Intense for 9 year old girl,"This book is well written and thought provoking, but it confronts readers with hard cold facets of emotional issues. Author is an excellent writer, however the subject matter and character depictions are heart-wrenching. Perhaps a 15 year old .... may be able to handle this. I realize that we live in a different world today than when I was a kid. The subject matter deals with death and loss, on a plethora of levels. I believe we can teach our children prayerfully in a gentler way. No doubt author is a great writer, but I suggest parents read this book first before giving to your children."
4,Sad but beautiful and lyrical,"Kate DiCamillo is a wonderful writer. I love the pacing, rhythm and flow of this story. Every sentence is well crafted. I cared about the characters.The story itself is darker than your standard middle-grade fare, and might be too much for happy kids who like to read happy stories. But for a child (10-13 ish) struggling with loss or grief, I think this would be a very good choice. It doesn't shy away from the pain and anger and grief, and it also shows light breaking through the clouds. It made me sad, but it was beautiful and I loved it."
2,Really a Short Story,"I write for children, so I read a lot of children's books. This one seems like a short story, rather than a novel. The characters are interesting but don't have much depth. It needed more back story -- just more of everything. Very disappointing because I really liked ""Because of Winn Dixie."""
2,The Tiger Rising,I gave this book 2 stars because it wasn't my kind of book. I thougt it was really slow. This book would of been better if the tiger did not die. I like fast reading books with adventure.
2,The Tiger Rising...disappointed,"My 8 year old son picked this book out because he read ""Because of Winn-Dixie"" and loved it. He and I both thought Tiger Rising fell short of our expectations. Another thing that really annoyed me is that DiCamillo uses profanity in her telling of this story. Her use of the word ""Damn"" is extremely inappropriate considering this book is being read by children. ""Darn"" would have worked equally well. He stopped when he got to that word and question me about it...he didn't want to read it out loud. My husband & I are very disappointed that any profanity, no matter how infrequent, would be in a children's book."
2,Much too simple,"The writing was not at all what I had expected it to be from all of the quotes on the book's cover and back. Like the story, it was all much too simplistic for any grades above 2nd. Words like 'not-thoughts' for example, really had no place in this kind of book."
2,Does a poor job,"The Easy-To-Clean aspirator does not muster up enough suction to effectively remove nasal congestion. Additionally, the tip is not big enough to create a good vacuum. I suggest the Luv N' Care Nuby Nasal Aspirator for sale at Walgreens."
1,disappointing,This product was very dissapointing. Its too soft and there is no suctions what so ever. The tiny tip falls off while trying to use causing a small panic if it getting stuck up the little ones nose. not to mention becasue of these problems the baby ends up throwing a fit and gets very upset.
2,Sizes run very small !,"The shirt quality is acceptable, the shirt sizes run extremely small, either they were mis-marked or the size chart are terribly off."
2,strange fit,"The quality is inferior. The fit on the body is strange. The neck area is wide, and the shoulder is tight. Large feels too big, yet the medium feels too tight. It did not suit me. So I return it."
4,They do what they are supposed to but it is not one size fits all.,I had to make some adjustments so that they would fit my pump. Once I accomplished that they work fine.
5,The Best Book On Selling I Have Ever Read,"In the course of my adult life, I have sold all sorts of products and services. I have attended many sales courses & read dozens of sales books with the aim of being the best. I must say that this book is undoubtedly the most comprehensive source of sound advice I have ever come across. It is well structured and good-humoured with a lot of content I have not come across before. I have since made this my bible of selling which I refer to again and again when I need a little inspiration or motivation. Mr. Ellis effortlessly manages to encapsulate everything you ever needed to know about being a success in the world of selling. Thank you."
5,Amazing book that marrys PhD w/ Intuition,"Dr. Schultz is an educated physician with medical intuition. In this book, she incorporates solutions for health issues that varies from acupuncture to vitamin/mineral therapy to pharmaceuticals. Too many authors seem to discredit one theory to validate their own premises but Dr. Schultz does not do that. She writes with clear articulate language that still supports her arguments with data and references. I am thrilled to see someone terribly educated comfortable with 6th sense and alternative medicines. Her book is for academics and casual readers."
3,a bit disappointing,"I initially enjoyed this book although the first chapter or so was not so good. But about two thirds of the way through I suddenly tired of the whole thing. I guess I found the details of brain differences between the sexes interesting, but as the book progressed I tired of the author's style of writing. Also some of her claims were a bit 'out there'. Not for me, glad I borrowed it before buying it. I'd like to give it two and a half stars really, but erred on the side of generosity."
3,doesn't deliver the promise,"Apart from relatively well known facts about difference between women's and men's brain (nothing you can't find on internet) the ""New feminine brain"" is dedicated to pms(just couple pages), depression, phobias, anxiety, obsessions etc. If you do not suffer from above listed alignments and prefer natural treatment to drugs and daily supplements there is little in this book for you. Please rent a book form a friend or the library prior to purchase to make sure its what you want."
4,The New Feminine Brain,"I love this book b/c it explains so much about me, each day or month that I feel different. It explains why I get it, and on another day I don't. Why my husband thinks the way he does, and it helped me to understand that I must let some things go. It gives me tools I need to eleviate my Arthritis, and my Menopausal aches and pains. Thank you, Tammy"
4,The new femenine brain:Developing your intuitive Genius,"I haven't finished the book yet but What I have read has been very informative.I especially like the readers participation questionnaire,they make the readingand analyzing very personal."
4,QUALITY CD PLAYER,"PRODUCT IS AS ADVERTISED AND IS QUALITY; ONLY DRAWBACK IS TIME IN LOADING THE CD'S AND MAINLY REMEMBERING TO IDENTIFY LOCATIONS OF CD'S..... ONCE THEY ARE LOADED, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND A CD IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE A CATALOG LISTING!"
3,one irritating problem,"This changer sounds good and once you get it going on all random, works great HOWEVER it always defaults to ""PO"" when I turn it on and I can find nowhere in the instruction manual to get it out of that mode so I have turn it on, open the disc compartment, close it, hit random and hope it goes there. Most of the time it does otherwise I have to repeat the process until it works. It's a pain but like I said, other than that, it's nice. If anyone else has run into this and has a fix I would really appreciate your input."
4,Great except CD Text (vs Sony CDPCX355),"This is a great product, as you can see from the other reviews. I chose the Pioneer instead of Sony's 300 disk version because of the reviews about the better quality of the Pioneer.My parents have the Sony CDPCX355. The one down side to the Pioneer that the Sony has better is the CD text feature. With the Pioneer, I don't have a single CD where the ""CD text"" is read and displayed. The Sony does a much better job of reading and displaying the titles and artists from CDs. Also the Sony has a keyboard port so you can plug in a keyboard and edit disk information manually (a very nice feature). Also, the Sony's display has a seperate line for CD text where the Pioneer replaces track information with the text. Because of this (I assume) the Sony displays the CD's text much more quickly (the Pioneer's manual says its displays the text after 5 seconds).For both players, I have a hard copy of CD locations so the CD text is no big deal but it is something to consider."
4,Pioneer PD-F1009 301,"Great invention to those who don't want to be attached to an IPOD, and like an updated version of a ""juke box"". Easy to use, load, unfortunately however, it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound."
5,reliable,"I needed to replace my Sony 200 disc changer because it skipped all over the first two tracks on every cd. The Pioneer is reliable, sounds great and can play every track on every cd. I like the extra slot for individual use. Keeping track of what's in the changer requires making a list or cataloging the cd covers."
4,Good for the money.,"I have had this for about a month now. I must say, for the price it isn't that bad. It has a lot of settings that you would need to constantly play with because of all the choices and some spl setting you might want to set for some movies, regular channels etc..All in all it does the job."
4,It replaced DirecTV new Sonic Music.,"When DirecTV changed from XM Radio music they switched to such an inferior selection of music, I had to do something. I had all the CDs about fifty that I only used on road trips. Now I have the music I what all the time. The only misrepresentation on the product is that there is no ""light"" in the access door as illustrated. Other that that it works fine. One Note: I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING ANY MULTI-DISC PLAYER ON RANDOM. The reason is the volume changes from old CDs to the remastered. JC"
2,Mechanical Failure at 1 year,"A year and 10 days after purchase, there was a clunking noise as the CD changed, That was that: the mechanical arm that loads the CD into the player compartment broke. Instead of going the repair route, we are changing over to mp3 and lossless formatting. Consider the extended warranty if you really want this machine!"
1,What happened to Pioneer,"Not impressed at all. Too bad because I always thought Pioneer meant quality but this product is nothing but junk. After a couple of hours cataloging and inserting all my cds I was looking forward to sitting and listening and learning what my player can do and after only the second cd change the machine jammed, the carousel would not turn, so I was forced to unscrew the case to remove the jammed cd. That was all I needed if it jammed once it will jam again. I do not need the headache; it gets returned and my search continues for a more reliable product."
1,broke after two months,My stereo broke after two months. It had played fine with no problems until one night a cd ended and as it went to change to the next disc I heard a loud cracking noise. Now the tray will not spin and no cd's will play. I had a great time getting over 265 cd's out of a tray that won't revolve. I would not recommend buying one of these although I did enjoy it for the time I had it. I basically paid $125 for each month I had it.
1,Not Working After Two Months,"I have had this CD changer for less than two months and it has just quit working. The carousel won't turn. So, I've had to take my system hookups apart, remonve the Pioneer CD changer from the mix, unscrew the cabinet and take out all 290 or so CDs that I have by hand from the top. Even with that the carousel won't move. So now I can wrestle with Pioneer service (I bought the unit via Amazon) to see if I can get it fixed between now and Christmas and at what cost to myself."
4,Pionner stock room,"This product is an item which I have always wanted. So when Amazon display the item, I took a chance to order it for my personnal use, Since then I don't regret it. I believe to enjoy it for a long time. thanks"
1,Random play not random,"My Pioneer PD-F1009 CD player has great sound. However, the random play does not function right. I have many CDs and songs loaded, and there is a core group of maybe about 20 (out of more than 500) songs that, on random play, are played much more often that is possible in a truly random programming. Before buying the F1009 I had the PD-F407, and it had the same problem."
1,Don't Buy this Crap!,I bought one of these things and no sooner had I got 300 discks loaded into it when the damned thing stopped working. I had to unload all the discs by hand and now the machine sits in a closet gathering dust.
5,love this book,"I loved the first volume and the second one is just as good as the first.I recommend this book to anyone who likes sherlock holmes or is going to see the movie so they can say ""THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN!"""
4,"Good solid edition, good price too.","i bought this book (and Vol.1 also) as a Christmas gift for our great-nephew (age 12 1/2) who has become a Holmes fan. I would have preferred an illustrated edition, but we wanted to give him the complete stories and this was the only edition that seemed to have them. The print was readable, the book was good quality, and the price was very reasonable.He was thrilled!"
5,The Complete Sherlock Holme Volume II,"I love Sherlock Holmes stories and had recently purchased The Complete Sherlock Holmes Volume I which I read. I wanted Volume II and I knew that I could find it on Amazon.com. It is well written with lots of historical information and biographical information about the author. A good book to take with you when you know you will be waiting a while, lots of short stories. I enjoyed this book very much and will keep it in my collection. If you like puzzles you will like these stories."
4,The second volume of sherlock holmes,"This is an awesome book. It comes in hardback for a great price and it is huge. I already owned the 1st volume of sherlock holmes too.The only dispute I had was that this volume and the first volume overlap.So up to page like 400 or something were stories I had already read in the first volume. But, the second half of the book were stories I had never read, and all in all it was a satisfactory product."
4,Harmonious,"I like this album a lot. I purchased it without any knowledge of this duo at all. I was very pleasantly surprised when I first heard the album and it has now grown on me. I reckon these guys wrote and recorded this in their bedroom and good for them - it has a sound of immaturity (not with the song writing, just the recording) and I love that about this album - its kind of raw. The style is a mix of old with new - some RNB with some 70s and 80s flavours (think PM Dawn). The vocals are nice and the harmonies work perfectly. This is not a top 20 mainstream album and I doubt it ever will be - that makes it all the more special - its not your typical throwaway formula song writing. Its difficult to categorise this album. I would certainly buy more of their work if it were released. I love the album and admire the artists a lot for their creativity and talent. A nice piece of work."
5,Gators,"great gift for Gator fans. Took longer than expected to arrive, but arrived in good shape.Only complaint is that the light bulb that came with it was just added to the pkg with no protection for the lightbulb. Didnt like that. It looked like someone added it as an afterthought."
4,Smear Guard Is Conditional,"I didn't realize when I ordered these that they had a Smear Guard feature, but I was glad to see it when I opened the package. It is true that you can highlight in a single swipe with no ink smearing. However, if this matters to you, avoid the back-and-forth swiping to cover the text from top to bottom because this WILL smear the ink. You can do multiple swipes in one direction without smearing, just not the back-and-forth motion. Otherwise, it's a great flourescent yellow highlighter!"
3,Not what I expected,"I thought these were the traditional thick round sharpies. They are actually in the ""pen"" style or form factor. If that is what you are looking for, they're great."
3,Neon Bright but still bleeds through paper,"I was disappointed that this highlighter still bleeds through many kinds of paper, such as standard paperback book paper. I find the tip on these hard to use but it may just be old eyes. I'll keep looking for a highlighter than can high light without bleeding through the paper."
4,Great value even if a little short-lived,"I've just about gone through a box of these, and they've done their job admirably. The ink applies evenly, dries fast, and the color is nice and sharp. My only gripe (and it's a minor one) is that each pen feel somewhat short-lived. As a grad student in the social sciences, I go through about 2-3 books-worth of reading a week, and it feels like each highlighter just barely makes it through the week... but then again at less than a buck per pen it's a great value regardless."
3,last days of marc b.,Less about t-rex in there prime. More about marc's comebacks in his final days. Interesting but not a concert vidio.
3,Interesting and novel but budget looks a bit dissapointing.,"There are a number of stories bundled here, 13, with the last cleverly titled Thirteen.. and most of the time they held my attention. I found some were certainly better than others, Vampirology was my favorite, with it's quirky documentary interview with the modern day vampire. Then there were tales that came across a bit silly, like Deptford voodoo.The rendering to DVD for the US market has that hazy quality that some times shows up in PAL to NTSC transfer, but this could be compression too as there is 6hrs of footage crammed onto 2 discs.Overall I'd say it is entertaining and offers value for money but buy it used.. you get what you pay for and if you can pay about 7$ I'd say that's good."
3,Satisfying,"Like any artist, everything they do isn't necessarily good and this collection points this up. Still, it's worth the purchase price, especially if it's your introduction to this great talent."
3,good,"Good Beauty book...lots of info on skin, nail, and hair care. I dont have anything to compare it to..since this is the only beauty book I own. she takes you through the basics of a beauty routine and tells you what supplies to have on hand."
4,Beautiful coffee table book,"I was hoping for more spacifics. The rooms are beautiful, no doubt, but who has an extra room that could hold three single beds decorated with teddy bears? Or a full bath for each guest room? There is not a full page of text anywhere in the book. There are many lovely quotes from famous people about the joys of company and some tongue-in-cheek suggestions for getting rid of guests who have over stayed their welcome, ""flip the breaker switch"". But other than repeated reminders that both guests and hosts should be flexible, there is little in terms of menu suggestions or turning an office into an overnight bedroom or how much closet space to allow per quest.Under ""Resources"" the first listed is ""Architects""(there are six) and one of the longest is ""Lighting"". This would be a beautiful supplementary book to the art of hosting."
4,A forgotten treasure,"I was cleaning out the garage and came upon this, which I bought when it was new. This is a rich and complex trilogy about an Earth girl who is swept up into the politics of a vastly powerful space-faring family. The author appears to understand hard science better than most SF authors, and she uses it judiciously. It is a shame this is out of print; it clearly deserves more recognition than it ever got."
4,Exactly what I needed,"My cabinet depth is 10"" so it won't fit the standard 10"" under mount depth for wine glass racks with enough room to actually move the glasses in and out. I mounted this parallel with the cabinet and it works great. It holds 5 large red wine glasses. I had 6 but that keeps them too close and one fell out and broke."
5,"""Poetry that's whimsical and wise""",": Sunday Chicago Tribune Book Section--Editor's Choice!""Celebration abounds but never gives way to sentimentalism in this sixth volume of poetry by veteran author Ira Sadoff. Often spare in his descriptions, Sadoff allows objects and observations to suggest their stories rather than overstate them. In many of the poems, a whimsical but wise voice presides, especially in 'An Improbable Delirium,' where a speaker slyly ruminates: 'Something tells me it's the job of poetry/ to bring some wretched character out on stage,/ to gesture wildly, giving a soliloquy....'""--Carolyn Alessio, deputy editor"
1,JUST SLIGHTLY BEHIND OUR TIME,"Once again Panasonic shows how out of touch they are with modern technology. Dont waste your money on this. If you burn your own DVD's forget it, it doesnt play DVD+R/RW, or DVD-RW. Every DVD player since like 2001 can play these discs, except the pana-fonics. The Samsung 5500 combo is cheaper, plays everything and has a better warranty too. Pana-garbage is always like one step behind everyone else. They are pana-fools, and I am pana-returning to the pana-store for a pana-refund."
5,AWESOME COMBO,This baby is awesome. It plays all my videos and CD. The image is very clear and no problems setting it up. Love the combo its great. If you what a good combo player this is the way to go.
4,everything but the TIME,I saw it in the other reviews and thought it has everything else I'm looking for ... I can do without the clock. It's driving me NUTS ;o)Other than that it's a great machine - the programing is a little goofy but it works great. I'm looking for a wall clock now though.
5,highlighter heaven,Love it just wish it didn't run out so soon. I read alot of research papers and highligt important facts so they don't last long but it doesn't bleed either which is great
4,An addition to our collection,"My 15 month old son loves Elmo. Our first video in the Elmo's world collection was Elmo has two hands, feet, and ears. Although this is still his favorite he enjoys all the videos.I believe it is the predictability of what will come next that he enjoys. All the videos follow the same format, which is great for a toddler.I like the videos because they intertwine the puppets, cartoons, and people all in one. They are educational as well as entertaining for my son.We are satisfied with this video, and would reccommend it to others."
2,Just watch PBS,"This is not an exercise video. It is a collection of Elmo segments from Sesame Street. My son likes it but it does not get him moving, and he is two years old."
4,Fun and educational,"My 2-year-old is gaga over Elmo and this DVD doesn't disappoint. It's educational, and I have definitely seen her wanting to ""eat right, drink water and exercise"" every day. It's cute.I do wish Mr. Noodle was not part of the series. My daughter doesn't like him and is sometimes outright scared of him (we have to skip over some parts)...and I honestly don't find him very funny, but ah well...overall, this is a great DVD!"
5,Should be REQUIRED READING for all parents.,"This book is OUTSTANDING. It gives theoretical background along with practical advice on countering the harmful messages girls receive from society. I found the dating chapters particularly helpful. It is vitally important that our daughters have strong, authoritative voices and feel capable and competent in their lives. That, after all, is our JOB as parents! Seriously, BUY THIS BOOK. You won't regret it."
2,Another great concept that's badly executed,"Curse of the Wolf is another film about a female werewolf that had much promise but it's terribly executed in production. Several great ideas (i.e. female werewolf struggling with her curse and her relationship with a fellow coworker) were never delved into. I felt is could have been a solid film but it never really goes anywhere. It tries too hard to be ""cool"" but it fails in the end."
3,book purchased,Really disappointing that you didn't finish the title of the book and as a result a bought this book unnecessarily and as a duplicate. This is exactly why I won't do business with you again. Shame of on you for not doing your job right. A waste of time and money.
1,it does not work,the items did not work at all. the drivers can not be installed. I have returned both items to amazon. too bad!
4,Use longer screws,"This came out of the wall about a month after I put it up. I remounted it with longer screws and added washers to better grip the rack, and now it seems to be stable."
5,Perfect for training poster set,"I purchased this to hold a set of posters for training and it fits the poster board perfectly. I wouldn't put it on an airplane or ship with it as it is a fabric-like portfolio, but I can carry it from campus to campus without damaging posters and it stores nicely in my trunk or back seat. I have a hard sided portfolio that I use for flying or for carrying professional photographs of the same size, and didn't want to pay a lot of money for classroom grammar posters so this fit the bill."
3,Decent Highlighters,"I am a college student, so I use highlighters a lot. I have these highlighters, as well as several other brands. These are okay, they get the job done, but they don't last very long."
3,"GOOD BOOK, BAD CARDS","I FOUND THIS BOOK INTERESTING. IT GAVE GOOD DETAIL, AND IS A GOOD START FOR BEGINNERS. THE BOOK IS SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT INTO A POCKET. THAT IS NICE, IT MAKES IT CONVIENT TO CARRY AROUND. HOWEVER, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT CAME WITH CARDS. THE CARD ARE TOO SMALL TO DO ANYTHING WITH. I WOULD BUY THIS BOOK AGAIN IF I WAS LOOKING FOR A CONVIENT BOOK ON TAROT, BUT NOT IF I WAS LOOKING FOR PRACTICAL TAROT CARDS THAT I CAN READ."
2,"These are not cards, they are Stamps!","The previous reviewer who got usable cards must have ordered the KIT by Dennis Fairchild, not THIS product. The 'deck' that comes with this book is nothing but a long strip of folded cardboard, 1"" high, with all the card pix printed on it, attached like a tiny party favor to the ribbon that functions as the bookmark. The deck is absolutely of no use, cannot even really see the pix. I really like the book and if it came with REAL cards I would have given it five stars."
1,Disappointed,"The cards and the book are too small to be of any practical use. As a novelty, it is fine. However, I did not think that was what I was purchasing."
2,No Cards,Got the book - which looks adorable - but no cards. Very unhappy. Hate dealing with returns. Will repurchase and hope to actually receive cards this time 'round.
2,Cards are 2 small but the book is fine.,"I liked the book, but I hope the cards would be like a regular deck of cards, but they were only an inch big. How are you supposed to work with that??"
3,Charming little set.,Charming but incomplete. I know is is a small set mostly for the sake of novelty but better packaging and documentation wouldn't have been hard for them to do.
3,not bad,"I like Kinski's rockin' songs, but this CD is half rock and half SUPER BORING ambient guitar noodlings."
4,A good simple guide for a beginning researcher,"I have not completed the book, but so far so good. I'm a doctoral student and the book is a reference book for my dissertation over the next many months. I really needed a book that broke the terms like ""theoretical framework"" down and this book did a pretty good job of coming down to the beginning researchers level."
1,5 missing DVDs,"As others have described, we were missing the 5 DVD's. Contacting Amazon now and we'll see their response. Hopefully it is positive.If you buy this, check the package as soon as you get it. Don't wait to give it as a gift then find that it is half empty."
2,Defective disk in Astaire movie collection,"Husband said this was one of the greatest birthday presents ever -- until we found the defective disk -- and then found the same defect in the replacement set. ""The Story of Irene and Vernon Castle"" won't play through. It stops and the pixels break up. We exchanged it for a replacement set. The replacement set ALSO won't play ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle."" This apparently is a production problem, since the replacement has the same problem at the same spot in the same movie. The first eight movies were great, sound great, picture quality great. Interesting commentary about background, especially about the dancing sequences and about the other people involved in making the movies. It seems,though, that you have to realize that you are getting one less movie than the box says.JCF"
4,Wonderful...eventually.,"The first time this was shipped to me, 5 of the 10 discs were missing. I contacted Amazon's customer service and they responded to my email within an hour (!) saying that they would replace the entire set. I received the new discs a week later, and they were all there. I returned the old discs as they asked, and I've been enjoying my movies since!The only disappointment with the set itself was that the included coupon for free full-size movie posters had expired 2 years ago. I'd been expecting it, but unfortunately WB no longer offers this bonus."
3,Astaire & Rogers,"All DVD's were satisfactory, except for ""Flying Down to Rio"", which did not have anything in it. when inserted into the DVD player.Robert E. Belke"
1,Half of the movies are missing!,"I received this as a gift, and all of the movies from the ""volume 1 collection"" were missing! The cases were in the box, but were empty.We sent it back to amazon and requested a new set. This too arrived missing half of the movies.When we called to ask what was going on, we were told that it was a known problem with the item and couldn't be fixed. We were given a refund and told to keep the half-complete set. Of course, without Top Hat, Follow the Fleet, Swing Time, or Shall We Dance, it's not much of an Astaire/Rogers collection!If you only want the volume 2 movies, save the money and buy that collection, because those are the ONLY movies you'll get with this product!"
1,Defective disc,"The disc for Shall We Dance is defective. There are small pimples near the edge of the disc, and on playback the picture and audio breaks up several times. Several minutes of the film are unwatchable because of this disc defect.Amazon would not refund or exchange the order because I reported it outside of their 30-day return policy. I was told I should have checked the discs before the 30-day period was up. For most people checking 10 movies all the way through (plus special features) in 30 days is pretty unreasonable.Thanks Amazon; you're super-helpful."
4,Awesome Movies!,"I love this box set because the movies in it are so great. It has been one of the best things I've purchased for enjoyment and I've watched the movies so many times over because they are pure joy! So sad this era of Hollywood is long gone they knew how to make joyful movies and this beats anything on TV or newly released movies. If you have kids this is what they should be watching!Only problem was with two discs in the set: SHALL WE DANCE (plays but needs to be ""massaged"") and VERNON AND IRENE CASTLE (last 1/4 of movie is a digital scramble so haven't seen the end of movie). I returned my first set and received a second set with the same exact problem with the same exact DVD's in the set. Didn't return because I love the set so much. Amazon credited my account a few dollars for the problematic DVD's and that's the only reason it got 4 stars and not 5."
4,Rogers and Astaire collection,"A very nice collection of their work together. Remastered dvd's have very good picture and sound quality. The extras on each disc,cartoon,short, trailer etc are also very entertaining.Would recommend this to any fan of their work."
1,Terrible experience - twice!,"Two times I ordered this product for my daughter for Christmas, and both times it came with 5 dvd disks missing. I have ordered many books and other products from other vendors through amazon, and have been very pleased with my experience overall. This was my first time ordering from Amazon itself, and I am very reluctant to order from them again. Felt I was due more than a refund after this fiasco!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS SET!!!!!!!!!!,"August 2009. Apparently Amazon has NOT corrected the missing dvd problem. Just received this set with 5 missing dvds(The Barkleys of Broadway, Shall We Dance, Swing Time, Follow the Fleet, and Top Hat). Just told by customer service I will have to wait one to three weeks just for availability of a replacement. Customer service is sorry about the inconvenience. Amazon is obviously not too concerned this problem continues to occur. I told my husband we shouldn't order this set based on the posted customer reviews but he insisted we try. Well, this is the proverbial ""I told you so"". My loss hopefully your gain in wisdom. Now I have no guarantee the next set will be complete. I asked customer service to open the set and look inside each dvd case prior to mailing. I hope they comply. Seems to be a gamble. Good luck to you if you decide to buy this set!!!"
1,BEWARE!,"Twice I ordered this set for my wife, and each time the package arrived with DVDs missing from the set! All the containers were there, but as many as five (5) DVDs were gone. What a joke. I gave up and purchased the set at Borders. Does Amazon care? Never heard from them."
5,Face of Deception,I enjoyed this book (which is a series). I have been reading westerns and this is a modern day mystery. I would recommend that anyone read this book.
4,Convicting!,"If my wife and I had not been against abortion, and the clinics that provide these services, this book would have convicted us of it! Carol Everett showed the reader of the immoral and even illegal practices of falsifying pregnacy reports to con young, and sometimes not so young women, into obtaining an abortion; killing of babies that managed to be born alive in the late tri-mester and dumping them into dumpsters, and falsifying medical reports with the hospital to avoid legal consequences for their mistakes during the abortion. She tells of how she ""sold"" abortions to women with the added pressure of ""it will cost you more the longer you wait."" Carol Everett has shown the deception of a multi-million dollar industry to the general public in the hopes that women will try alternates to abortion, like adoption or even keeping their child. It is a must for anyone interested in fighting this industry."
1,Warning do not buy!,"I thought that this set includes the stemware boxes since that is what it says in the description, but it does not. You can buy this same set for cheaper on another site if that's all you want. I really think this ia a matter of false advertising, since it's in the picure as well as in the description. The quality seems alright and the shipping took forever. Needlass to say I was very dissappointed with this purchase."
4,The time is right...,The time is right and the writing is well done. Someone had to tell the story to release many women who were bound in unconventional relationship on how to survive and thrive in the midst of the challenge.It's good to know we can overcome and through Christ we come out winners.P. Hudson
2,Science??,"This is a fun, well laid out book, but in the intro., astrology is referred to as a science! Please! Let young people have fun with astrology, but don't tell them it's science!"
5,Sweetest Book I've Ever Read,"This is the sweetest book I've ever read. Even though it was written for juniors, I loved every page. The illustrations are adorable. One of my favorite sections is ""Okay, So You're Not a Cancer..., but Your Crush Is,"" ""Your Best Friend Is,"" and so forth...Get the book - I would tell you it's a great gift, but I'm keeping this one for myself."
5,In my best guide FOR BEGINNING WICCANS,I put this exellent book in my Best reading guide for beginning wiccans - you should go check it out!!!!!
5,I like this book very much.,"... I read this book when my friend got it, and then I got one of my own because I liked it so much. I think all of it makes a lot of sense, because my sign is Aries, and now when people tell me to stop always wanting to be first, I can tell them that I'm supposed to be first, because I am an Aries, and that is the first sign. I also liked the book because it tells you things about the stars, and I like to learn about astronomy. I like the stories about the names of the stars, too. My little brother likes the book, too, but he's not an Aries. My cat is a Leo, and she does act like a lion. The book is very pretty, too."
5,Thank our lucky stars for Aslan!,"Finally, an astrology book for kids. It's about time! And Aslan's book treats the subject with the respect it deserves. It's accessible to young readers without beng watered down or oversimplified, and it allows (or better yet, inspires) young astrologers to tune into the cosmos and simultaneously reflect on the self. The information is solid and intriguing, and there's just the right ""light"" touches to keep every kid fascinated. Astrology provides an excellent framework from which to experience this confusing world, and Aslan's book helps prepare kids to think deeply about relationships, examine issues (and relationships) from different perspectives, and figure complex things out by seeing where they fit into the big picture. Is there anything more important than that? This is a great read for children of all ages!"
1,YUK!,"Not at all what I wanted. It is a plastic slip on that pushes the buttons when you don't want them pushed. Ordered 2 and plan to return them. I usually don't even bother to write a bad review; I just don't write one, but in this case I'll make an exception. Yuk! Actually, I rate it at a ""0"" but there was no ""0"" selection. It is a stretchy skin."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"This jacket is so tight that it holds down all the buttons at once and the Creative Zen will not work with it on. Do not waste your money on this product, you will be very disappointed."
1,Poor Description,"I have a huge set of Pfaltzgraff. And I love it. Unfortunely, over the years my set has seen some damage. My sugar bowl was damaged and needed to be replaced. So, when my husband ordered this for me, I was excited. To our dismay when the order arrived the lid was missing. If the phrase 'single piece' is your way of discribing just the bowl then say 'just bowl no lid'."
1,Don't waste your money,"I told my parents to get this for my child for Christmas and feel so bad that they wasted so much money on it. It doesn't matter what setting it's on, it never goes off before the last item is picked off the saddle and even then most times nothing happens. My child was so excited when she got it, having asked for it specifically, but if I could I would return it to the company. I was suprised to see that they even make it still."
3,Cute game,"This game is pricey for what you get, but it is a cute game. My children squeal and laugh when the mule bucks and throws off his cargo. I have to admit, it will make you jump. If the children enjoy it, then it's worth the money."
3,Fun - but not very durable,"My four year old loves this game. I can't say it's my favorite, but hey - whatever he likes works for me. The only problem we have is that it didn't take long at all before the thing broke. Now it won't reset and stay down. My son is terribly disappointed, and I'm now buying another one, hoping that this is just a fluke. This is a game for younger kids who are still in the phase where they are less interested in a challenge and more interested in winning (if the thing doesn't buck at all we consider it a win for everyone.) All in all this isn't a terribly complex, challenging, or educational game. But it's entertaining for my son, and really - he's the critic who's opinion matters most."
3,Fun family entertainment,"My 3 year old son loves this game. I found that the mule was a bit sensitive and sometimes bucked while we were trying to get it set up, but overall it was a good time for the whole family."
1,Very Disappointing,I have not written a review before but this toy was so disappointing I had to save others from making the same mistake I did. Our Buckaroo will buck sometimes but it takes at least 10 tries to get his back feet down to play the game. It is something only an adult with just the right touch can do. Very frustrating for everyone. Please do not waste your money on this toy.
2,Eh,"My 4 year old son had been wanting this for months and finally got it for his birthday. It seems we also have the problem of it being way too sensitive, so half the time, as soon as we try to put one piece on, it bucks. Gets old pretty quickly. It does make us jump and laugh, though. But I wouldn't recommend it."
1,worst game ever!,"My 4 year old son got this game for Christmas. He is a big game lover and when we played it, he said ""this is the dumbest game Santa ever brought me""! No matter what level you have it on, it does not buck. Every time we've played it we get all the pieces on and then my son pushes down on the whole thing to make it buck. What a waste of $17! I am taking it right back to Toys R US. Please don't waste your money on this!!!"
3,"Not worth the ""bucks""","My son received this game as a gift-he had been asking for it. Well...he is 3 and does love to play it, but it isn't all that fun if you are any older. It takes a lot for the mule to buck-even on the most sensitive level (3). It is a cute concept, but not worth the money. My son does jump when it bucks, but we are not surprised because it is usually the last piece of equipment that sets it off."
1,Buckaroo won't buck,"We got this game as a gift and the tension was high as we loaded buckaroo with more an more items. Finally we ran out of items and he still didn't buck. We tried increasing the sensitivity, but it still didn't work. We threw out the toy. It is in a landfill or has been burned for electricity by now."
1,Won't buck. Didn't hit the mark w/ this one.,"I wanted to love this. I bought Buckaroo for my son's cowboy birthday for a relaxing activity on the picnic table between pony rides but it was just a prop. A big disappointment. They can load and unload and reload w/out it ever bucking once. Waste of Money. If they can improve it, I'd buy it again though. It just needs tweaking, more sensitivity."
1,Kickin' your dollars out the window,1.) The donkey *literally* only bucks when he feels like it (won't buck even when all the items are on him)2.) Have to press the back prong for it to move. (which is cheating)My 2 year old loves the game but has no idea I have to manipulate the donkey.
2,Pay attention to the negative reviews!!!,"I read the reviews others posted about this game before purchasing it. Most said that Buckaroo wouldn't buck no matter how heavy the load or how sensitive the game setting. I should have listened. This game was on clearance for around $5, so I figured what the heck? Well, five bucks down the drain and one worthless game later, I've learned my lesson. Buckaroo doesn't buck unless your 3-year-old drop kicks him across the living room. My son spent over 30 min. loading Buckaroo up with the included ""supplies"", and then he threw in some HotWheels and Thomas trains to boot. No bucking. I gave it 3 stars for durability only...after being kicked across the room several times, Buckaroo is still in one piece. Don't waste even $1 on this one... :("
1,Horse doesn't buck!!,This toy was very disappointing. We tried and tried to get the horse to buck but it never did. I can't believe I paid $18 for it. I'm definitely returning it - this toy is a dud!
2,Buckaroo is a Buck-a-don't!,"My daughter received this game early this year. We were all so excited to try it out but boy what a dumb, frustrating game. Neat idea...but doesn't work right. I thought the idea of having 3 levels was good, but for us, no matter what level of sensitivity you set in on, it will not buck at all. My daughter is not even 4 yet, and every time..she gets every piece on the horse and it still doesn't buck. She has to press on the rear of it to make it work. This game was such a disappointment and I really would NOT reccommend it to anyone. I wish I could have tried it out first. Also, the saddle is hard to get on for a younger child and it doesn't stay on well either. Bummer!"
1,Stink-aroo,"Picked this up after the enticing commercials my 3.5 yr old saw ... and returned it the day after. Definitely not worth the price (...)! Pieces kept falling off, we couldn't get the saddle to stay on and most of the prongs were not long enough to hold any of the pieces. Other times we could load the horse up and it wouldn't buck at all! Save your money for something other than this plastic gem."
3,fun---but sketchy--game,"I saw Buckaroo advertised on tv, and we picked it up for my 5 year old son (and me). The objective is too simple; you try to load up as much gear on the saddle of a horse without him ""bucking"" all of it off. Sounds easy but it isn't.This game is pretty fun overall. Colorful pieces, cool looking horse, simple concept. My only complaint is trying to get the saddle to stay on. The saddle is the piece that you actually ""hook"" all the gear onto, and sometimes it won't stay on. This translates into a lot of frustration b/c you can't even get the game started without the saddle in place.Aside from this fact, the game is fun and there are no dice or cards in sight...=)"
1,JUNKAROO!!!,"Don't waste your money (at least $15.99 + tax) on this game which should have been named JUNKAROO...My 5 yr. old son received this for Easter, and even he said this game is a ""joke"" and a piece of ""junk""...he is a total game lover, has been wanting this thing since after Christmas, and is sorely disappointed in it, as well as me and his father. It might be better suited for a 2 or 3 yr. old, but watch out for the smaller parts, w/ younger ones. A 5 yr. old is way beyond this game."
3,Repeat of the past,"I had this game when I was a youngster, except it was called something like ""Bucking Bronco"" and it was a horse, not a mule. It was a fun game for my age at the time but I remember playing it on Christmas and the hind end broke the first day we played it. It seems the engineers still haven't fixed the problem on the newer version."
2,A disappointment; Too far from the classics we know and love,"I must say, I just received this CD today and if you are expecting the classics, you will be disappointed. The melody, speed, words etc are quite different from the classical songs we all know. They advertise the cd as ""Old Favourites with a New Twist"", but I found the twist a bit too far from the original versions. This is not the type of CD you can put on for your child to help him learn the words of the songs. I bought this CD for my 2 year old son, based on great reviews I read on Amazon.com, so clearly I am in the minority. I will try to give it a chance for it to grow on me but first impressions are most certainly a disappointment."
2,Not too fun.....,"My daughter wanted to learn some songs to share with her daughter. I thought this might fill the bill, but it wasn't what I expected and not really fun or catchy....sorry"
5,Kids songs that are actually fun,"Great change from other kids CDs. This one is really fun to listen to, and doesn't make your ears bleed. Have been a Hap Palmer fan since I was his target market, and now it is fun to see my little girl enjoying it too. Only disappointment was the word change in the Elephant, but I had already taught my daughter the original lyrics. LOL."
5,Great Kid Tunes,"I bought this for my daughter, who is two, and my older kids love it as much as she does. Easy to remember lyrics and catchy tunes make this a great cd to listen to."
5,One of the Best Books EVER Written,"I read this book the first time a few years ago, and reread it every year.I believe this is Alice Walker's finest book. It's sexy, exciting, healing, intriguing and reveals a wisdom that each of us should seek.I truly believe that The Temple of My Familiar is the BEST book that I have ever read. I highly recommend it!!"
2,Mixed feelings,"I would be the first to praise Alice Walker's skill as a story teller, and her prose always entertains me and makes me think. That's why I gave this book the stars I gave it. I don't mind the 'out there' spirituality. I don't buy it, but I have no deep gripe against it either. What I find depressing and surprisingly childish about this book is the implied contention that if women of color ran the world, everything would be good and just. The simple truth of humanity is that it is power that corrupts, not whiteness or gender. If women of color ruled the world instead of white men, they would simply become the newest oppressors, in my opinion. I keep trying to enjoy Alice Walker's books for more than their style and skillful prose, but the message of reverse racism is still there. I am white, but I am not evil/privileged/pathetic/racist/oppressive/smug/whatever. If I were, I would not keep trying to read Alice Walker. I wish she would open her mind to that possibility."
5,Shakespeare who?,"This book is filled with so many ideas that I must read it many times, in many different ways, in order to absorb them. Of course I don't agree with all the ideas, and of course the characters aren't perfect; they're human. What I find so profound is the number of ideas and how serious they are. This book changed the way I think and fills me with joy every time I read it, which is often."
1,one of the worst books ever by a good author,"i was so excited when i saw this book really thinking it was going to be a 'sequel' to 'the color purple'! ha! it took me three years to get thru 1/4 of the book. then i tried again about two years ago and i got a little further this time lacking 1/4 to finish it, i just cant bring myself to do so. the book was horrible! one lady kept changing forms reliving past live verified through photos and her husband was ok with her sleeping with whomever she wanted whenever she wanted because a)he had such deep love for her & b)he was scared for life from seeing her give birth!! what kinda-mess!! im not even gonna get on the crazy rock star pervert who marries the daughter and seduces the mother!! this book is doo-doo and im kinda mad with ms. walker because i know she can do so much better than this trash. it only got a star because amazon made me"
1,REAL DISAPPOINTED,I WILL NOT BE ORDERING FROM AN OUTSIDE SOURCE AGAIN. THIS BOOK LOOKED LIKE A DOG HAD CHEWED IT UP AND SPIT IT OUT. THINK TWICE BEFORE ORDERING A BOOK OUTSIDE OF AMAZON'S WAREHOUSE.
2,Could get into it.,Maybe my expectations were too high after this was recommended to me but I got bored early into the book.
3,a strange unique book,the temple of my familiar deals with alot of spirituality which can often be doubted ..AT times walker captures the perfect images and analogies to life and human mankind and history. she tends to run on far too often and the book begins to get boring once she drones on the same subject. However it is a good book which stimulates you to think about life and people and i recomend it to those who have the patience to read the whole novel.
5,Enthralling,This is a book that I will always remember! I was completely enthralled in it. I loved the memorable characters in this book. I also loved how each character continued to grow and explore things about themselves. I found this book very easy to relate too.
5,absolutely essential resource for all upper midwestern gardeners,"this is one of the most useful books i have ever read to help me keep my garden healthy and invader-free. i purchased a property that was almost nothing but garlic mustard, stinging nettle, cling-ons and various volunteer elm; this book not only helped me identify what to remove but the explained the best ways of ensuring they don't come back. she lists invaders as those that are major concern, can be a concern, concerning but don't spend too much energy worrying about it, etc. it is a wonderful resource and is most certainly $20 (i spent $30) well-spent. i would have loved to read more books from her!"
2,BIG disappointment!,Every Spring I have the same problem in my garden - is that sprout a weed or a flower - to pull or not to pull??? I needed a book to help me identify what is coming up - weed or flower. I ordered this book thinking it would do that - it does NOT. It has way more text than pictures of weeds - most of the pictures are of mature weeds & many are taken from a distance & some are blurry. This book is no help to me. If I had been able to look through this book before ordering I certainly would not have ordered it.
2,"Beautiful, but broken","I ordered one of the Goldfish as a present for my adult daughter. When the Goldfish arrived, I opened the Amazon box and found a smaller box inside, which contained the Goldfish. To my dismay, the Goldfish was poorly wrapped inside the box and had a large hole in it's side where a fin should be, however the piece was not inside the box. I immediately returned this one to Amazon and ordered another one.The second Goldfish arrived today and was packed in the same manner. Upon opening the smaller box, I discovered that the Goldfish's tail was broken, however the missing piece was not inside the box. I immediately returned this to Amazon and WILL NOT be ordering a third one."
3,Good quality but a little disappointing,"The quality of this item is good but the performance was kind of weak. The trampoline didn't really provide any type of ""spring"". The kids had an ok time for a while but were bored pretty fast. I just don't think there is a way to get a true trampoline effect with a inflatable object that is floating on water."
5,movin' & groovin' DVD,The songs on this DVD are fun and easy for kids to follow. My grandkids had lots of giggles and laughs while watching this DVD.
4,Pretty durn good ride,This is one of IIIrd Tyme Outs best CD's. They get better with age. Their rendition of Wade in the Water was moving and there are alot of great fast tunes to get your foot stomping. I highly recommend this to any bluegrass fan!!
3,Durable Watch,Durable but hard to read at night. The dial is a very dark blue-black color. I wear it to the gym and have noted that it is very accurate.
4,100% Lifetime Warranty,Great company...all of their products have a 100% lifetime warranty. I broke this product by backing over it with my car (accidentaly of course) and I called to buy a replacement. They had me send in the broken unit and they gave me a new one for free.
2,works well until it breaks...,"I bought this at a retail store, and had owned it for a couple of hours, and was placing cds into the little rolodex type cards, when I was walking down the stairs. I dropped it, and 10 of the 11 provided sleeves were broken... grr.."
3,Readable But Rather Dry,"If you desire a track by track description of almost every song recorded by Van Morrison up till the time of this book's publication, you will find it here. However, Mr. Hinton has never actually spoken to Mr. Morrison. So his source material is limited to previously published interviews. One of the book's drawbacks is the author's obsession with some ninny who alleged that Mr. Morrison is no poet. Those of us who have enjoyed his music through the years know better, so Mr. Hinton's repeated assertions to the contrary are rather silly and unnecessary. The book contains an excellent discography that even covers several of the more popular bootlegs that are out there. A good basic biography, but rather dry."
2,josh dose not look the same in this then in the new ones,this season sucks i like the new season becase josh looks talks deffernt
5,Loved It,"If your kids are fans of the Drake and Josh TV show, you'll probably want to add this to your collection.The DVD contains episodes from the series and is typical of this type of program for older kids and pre-teens. Each episode deals with a different topic or situation typical to kids around that age -- though admitedly, some of the issues and situations would only come up if you lived in CA or you were progeny of yuppie parents.The episodes are highly entertaining and there's good chemistry between the actors. Each episode has an underlying message, but it's never preachy nor so obvious that it feels like they're beating you over the head with it.My son loves this, and I even find it entertaining. The only question, is when are more episodes going to be released. You'll want those, too."
1,This is not the Canterbury Tales!,"This is a retelling of the Canterbury Tales, very simplified...in some cases leaving out the best parts! I believe it may have been originally intended safe for children.If you're looking for a translation into modern English, keep looking. I am."
1,Unreadable!,"I note that the first reviewer is Daniel Byrd, a colleague that Dr Cox works with at times.I cannot agree with Dr Byrd's view. I found this book to be impossible to read. It is highly mathematical, poorly laid out, written in a very heavy, formal style and focuses entirely on human health risk, which is not apparent from the book title.I also know that some of the analyses that were performed in the book, and models Dr Cox created, have turned out to be extremely dubious, if not simply wrong.I am afraid that I cannot recommend this book at all."
3,I was a bit dissappointed,"The Count is my 3 year old son's favorite character on Sesame Street and I was hoping to get a dvd with more of him in it. He was the host, but there were not any of his skits in it :-("
3,Not a favorite,"We aren't crazy about this dvd. I thought the songs would be about counting, but it's only a countdown of songs. Most of the songs are slow and not upbeat with not much action (like doctors singing about hygiene). It's very dated looking. My toddler usually wanders off when this is on. She likes Kids Favorite Songs with Elmo much better."
1,Count it highre,I bought this product as an interactive tool to help my son counting numbers. The video was about count down video-musical hits from Sesame Street. My six year old and me agree giving it two thumbs down.
3,not too bad,"They're pretty good highlighters.I don't like the angle of the tip too much tho, it always misses on the page (ie, I miss my line when highlighting, or highlihgt only half the line because half the tip isn't touching the paper)And oh yea, this is a YELLOW highlighter. Not a fluorescent one, like I thought.Other than that, it's a pretty good highlighter."
4,Like,It was reasonably priced and I always love the quality of sharpie highlighter. You will not be disappointed. It seems to be lasting longer than other highlighter as well.
2,These blead through,"Unfortunatly these highlighters bleed through most paper.... highlighting lines on both sides. This is not good and makes them unuseable for my purposes. This is common among highlighters, I've been looking for one that doesn't blead for quite a while. So far the best alternative I've found is good old Crayola washable kids markers."
1,all dried out!,"I bought a dozen of these highlighters from Seller ""The Mega Deals""I paid HALF the retail price for these, around $6.50 for 12 highlightersWell, they're mostly dried out and hardly highlight at all ... so Buyer beware.Getting the highlighters from this Seller is a complete waste of your money"
5,Purple highlighters!,I love these! I use purple a lot at the office and this just falls right in to the rest of my supplies! Perfect!
1,Chisel Tipped Sharpie Highlighters are NOT Accurate and Smooth,"Okay, I'm a bit in rant mode here. I'm not even sure what the old style tip was called - the blunt, flat but cut-on-an-angle Sharpie Highlighters. About a year ago (or so) they switched over to a chisel tip and IMO this was a disastrous move (I take my highlighting seriously). I can not find the old style tips anywhere! The problem with the chisel tips is that you cannot get a strong, thick, consistent line of ink across a whole line. So you have to go back and re-do it. Sometimes again- just to get a neat line. Now that bookmakers are cheaping out on paper (even hardcovers), this means there's bleed through to the other side of the page.Sharpie- please bring back the old style tips! At least make them available."
3,Goods not as advertised,I ordered these thinking they would be the same ones featured in the picture. They are much darker (think sunflower yellow crayon color) and don't have smear guard.... oh well
2,Cannot highlight textbook easily,"These used to work great on textbooks, for highlighting a whole row of text (not just underline, but solidly through the text). But after the chisel tip, it is too wide to highlight a row of text. Using the side of the tip, then it is too thin. The old style of these highlighters didn't have the chisel tip, and the side of the tip is just perfect for textbooks. Now I have to use the pen-style liquid accent highlighters ( [...] ), and they run out very quickly, and they cost one dollar each, instead of 59 or 69 cents big ones which could last several time longer than the pen-style ones."
3,"Not my kind of music, but I have respect for this","These guys aren't winning any points for writing classic, breathtaking songs. But they ARE pretty hip, and they are a very tight band instrumentally. I bet if they had to, they could play Dream Theater."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"They've changed a lot since their ep. Kinda jumped on the pop-metalcore bandwagon to a degree, and they're on a major label now so the glossy soulless production is to be expected. It's so sickening the way metal is being portayed by little bitch bands like this, draining it of all it's intensity to appeal to the mainstream emo crowd, while still trying to hold onto metal credibility. Turning screamy vocals into something that doesn't represent intensity or aggression anymore, just another way to conform to a pop template. This is disgraceful. These guys have absolutely no business being named after a Cap'n Jazz song."
1,the unit seem to work,"the unit looked as though it was used. the impact wrench would spin catch and then never again, i just figured that i been had on a bad deal if i could i wish i can send it back so amazon can figure it out"
4,Fine for comp practice and good listening,For the amateur/professional DanceSport competitor or ballroom dance enthusiast the album offers a good variety of dance styles in strict tempo performed by an experienced orchestra with a nice sound. A must to add zest to your music library when the old becomes stale. RDP.
3,A geat blanket but not big enough to swaddle,"I registered for this item and was a little disappointed. We love the fact that it's organic and it is great quality but my baby is only 4 weeks, weighs 9 pounds and the blanket simply isn't wide enough to swaddle him. We will enjoy it as a blanket to cover him in the stroller or to use as a drape when nursing but not as a swaddle. For a really great swaddle blanket try swaddle designs."
2,read it if you dont have another tutorial book.,I got this book from county library.Maya Free tutorial is better than this book.
1,Poor :(,"This book only makes sense for the ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. Its fairly well organized and displays limited technical merit explaining interface and concepts. However, it dwells far too long on step by step directions for operations anyone who isnt lobotomized could figure out with minimal instruction. The illustrations and cd-rom are a joke. Family reunion textures? Most of the pages are filled with unnecessarily oversized images. The cover image is completely unrelated to the content. I would be ASHAMED to waste paper and ink publishing this book at its retail price. If I had paid anywhere near retail I'd be demanding a refund. Its not worth the cost of shipping unless you are an ABSOLUTE BEGINNER. It serves its purpose as a simple introduction/review of concepts nothing more. I skimmed through it in an hour and tossed it aside as a library donation."
4,Very interesting item,"I'm reviewing for the recently 2 DVD edition and not for the single one. First DVD contains interviews with Dave Jackson, Nick Potter and C. J. Smith but not with VDGG leader Peter Hammill.The second DVD is the best part because it features all the available TV appearences of the band: Darkness and Whatever would robert have said? from German TV Beat Club 1970, Theme One and Lightkeepers from Belgian TV 1972 and the complete Godbluff live set from Belgian TV 1975.The beat club part has a great quality and the 1972 and 1975 shows are slightly inferior than the quality of the Godbluff DVD."
3,Not compatible with VX8100,"I purchased this for my LG VX8100 mobile phone, but it would not charge my phone. I returned it and got a replacement, thinking the problem was due to a faulty connector. However, the replacement also did not work. I think this charger must not be compatible with the VX8100 even though the package and Amazon description indicate that it is. The connector plugs into the phone fine, but it looks different than the original charger that ships with the phone."
1,NOT FOR 8100,"The title explains itself, it didn't work for my phone so if you have an 8100 don't buy it. I actually doubt it works for any other phone either so don't bother."
1,Charger Doesn't Work,"This charger doesn't work! The connection between the cord and the phone does not work unless physically pushed together; as soon as you let go and set the phone down, the connection disconnects and charging ceases. This charger is utterly useless!"
1,THIS CHARGER DOES NOT WORK FOR ANY OF THE PHONES,"DO NOT BUY, IT HAS 100% NEGATIVE FEEDBACK WITH EVERY CUSTOMER SAYING THAT THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK, AS IT DID WITH MY PURCHASE."
3,a bit simplistic,"Good listening inspirational music, but a bit simplistic for my taste. I guess it is good to be reminded of the basics though. If this is her best, then I'm not tempted to buy her other (non- best of) albums."
4,Excellent,"I purchased this CD especially for the Green Eggs and Ham song for a Dr. Suess celebration. But there were others on here that I found that I liked also. This is one of the CD's that the kids say, ""Can we do that one again?"""
2,Basically a Duplicate,This video covers pretty much the same material as his Volatility Primer video (which I would recommend more than this one). He does get a little more into calendar spreads and covered writes in this video which may make it worth it if you're focusing on those strategies.
4,Foresically Tasty,"I must disagree with the previous reviews. This book neither wanders nor loses its track. It is a forensic examination of the life of Jacques de Molay which, because of the lack of much documentary evidence, widens its examination to include the times and other personalities to get a sense of what is possible and normal for a man the period. Wherever possible, though, all conclusions and inferences are drawn from primary sources and original rather than second hand material. It is refreshing to see the French tradition, as opposed to the Anglo-German interpretation, of the Templars, their Order and final days. This is perhaps not a book for the average reader but for a medieval scholar it is invaluable reading."
3,Academic Look at Jacques de Molay,"This is a pretty academic work on the biography of Jacques de Molay, the last Grand Master of the Order of the Temple. In truth, his whole biography is summed up in the last chapter - there isn't much to go on, and if anything, the author, in painting a balanced view of de Molay, tries to understand the truth behind the legends. In essence, de Molay is seen as a relatively simple man, with a temper, that was ill equipped for leading the order in a post-crusades politically charged Europe. The book itself is not that fun to read, and it proved to be very dry. If you have a passion for the Templars or de Molay, you might find it worth picking up. If you don't, take a pass on it."
3,Andrew Murray on Prayer,This is a book for those who want to be inspired in their spiritual life. I read a chapter each night to refresh my knowledge of how to pray. The information is timeless and solidly Bible-based. He wrote this book almost 100 years go and it is still current for our needs.
5,Andrew Murray on Prayer,"It's a treasure to own. I've read many books on Prayer, but this one excelled in what prayer is really about. According to the author, prayer is not coming to God to ask for something, but rather it's a fellowship with Him to come under His power of Holiness and to take possession of Christ's nature. The book is not an easy read, with simple steps to bring miracles to happen. Instead, it's an in-depth guide to learn to lead a powerful and joyful fellowship with God. Anyone who wants to empower their prayer life and Christian walk will be truly blessed by this book. Overcoming prayerlessness, petitioning God courageously, interceding for others effectively, receiving cler direction from God are some of the subjects the author is addressing in this book. I'll strongly recommend this book to the church library as well as to anyone who wants to live the abundant life Christ talked about."
5,A Female Southern Poet of note,"Martha McFerren's poetry, while on the prosy side, is narrative genius. Her incisive and, at times, biting insights into human nature, Southern existence, life as a woman, and a writer's plight are thought-provoking and hilarious by turns. I laughed aloud during ""Southern Gothic"" and ""Weird Doctors"", and ""Dog Suicide"" is a mantra for all struggling non-sentimentalists. Every poem in this book, in fact, is a gem. McFerren's work is worthy of much wider circulation."
5,"fast pace, engaging, brilliant use of language","Martha McFerren is simply one of the best poets I know. Her poetry deals with themes of popular culture and the wacky juxtapositions contemporary life serves up as daily fare. A fascinating, multi-layered, often hilarious excursion down the great metaphorical U.S. highway...ride on."
2,watch the description; does not match the photo,"The picture shows a set of two one large one smaller yet you get only one. The description is misleading; as is the photograph. It is a nice looking item ; well packed and interesting, but very small for the money."
1,buyer beware,I was sent the wrong charger in box marked Treo 650. I returned the item but have still received the correct charger. Don't even bother with this one
1,You get what you paid for!,"Despite the other reviews, I bought this and the plug started to become detatched from the cord on the first day. It worked for about another 2-3 weeks but then it finally broke off completely. I am in the process of getting a refund from Amazon! Spend the extra money to buy a quality product!"
1,Loose wires,"I should have read the reviews first! The charger is very flimsy. The wire sheath had already popped out of the charger brick exposing wires when I opened the first one ordered. I don't know why I didn't just send it back for a refund, because the second charger lasted one day before the same protective cover around the bare wires popped loose on the end that plugs into the phone. Poor product, not worth your time or the money."
1,Charger already broken,"I really liked the size of this charger, however it now seems like it has a broken wire in it or something so it will only charge my phone if you have the cord in a certain position. The charger lasted less than 2 months."
1,Didn't charge the phone,"Sure, the charger fit the port,but it did not charge, so it was of no use whatsoever."
1,"Dull, dull, dull",I hated this book. The author's style of writing is dull and tedious and the book is filled with common sense advice. Not worth the paper it's printed on.
5,"Anyone with husband,kids ,and a carreer--this is for you!!","If you have kids, carreer, and a husband, you must read this enlightning social probe into the lives of families just like yours. You will feel 'comfort' knowing that you are not alone if you are feeling crazy, anxious, or overwhelmed. Before you quit your job, or think of having another child.....Read this!!!"
2,"If you want something well written, this isn't it.","Probably a first of its kind study about families with two-working parents. However, the writing is poor, redundant and cliched. The cases she presents don't suggest much variability except income and ethnicity. Additionally, she skimps on a serious evaluation of what would make a successful household with two working parents and instead leaves us with the overwhelming feeling that success is almost impossible."
3,The book that defined the problem of women's double day,"This groundbreaking book was the first that dared to speak the hidden truth--that despite women's advances in the workplace, we still perform the bulk of the unpaid, unfulfilling chores at home. Unfortunately, far too many of the solutions Hochschild proposes involve government programs--not too practical, in my view. My marriage was in a state of emergency, so I hired a twenty-hour-per-week housekeeper. My experiences, including a dramatic improvement in my whole family's quality of life, led me to write ""A Housekeeper Is Cheaper Than a Divorce: Why You CAN Afford to Hire Help and How to Get It."" If the disparity of who does what at home is causing strife in your marriage, you can start with Hochschild's book to understand the problem, but be warned that you'll have to look someplace else for a solution."
5,Starker's sparkling interpretation is beautiful...,"In this recording Janos Starker exhibits an astounding display of technical mastery of the cello, caressing each nuance and making technical impossiblilities into unique musical experiences. As a cellist, I highly recommend this recording for both study and casual listening, and anyone who enjoys the beauty of the best instrument ever will love it!"
5,5 star & worked as expected.,"Not much to say about a box of highlighter pens. Always buy Sharpie, don't waste your money on generic highlighters!"
5,Wouldn't buy anything else.,We go through about two boxes of these per year. I use highlighters when I'm working on projects and my kids use them for school. The Sharpie highlighters are the only ones that don't smudge all over my son's hand (he's left-handed)
3,new ones not for books,"I have used the Sanford highlighters for close to 20 years. there are nice. However, just yesterday I got some from a local store and it is now called ""Shapie by Sanford"". They are almost a disaster when highlighting textbooks. The wide brush is too wide. The side (the narrower brush) is really thin. So, I cannot highlight any books or textbooks and had to return them.I guess the new ones could be good for highlighting invoices or business computer printouts, but they may lose some customers who would like to highlight books."
4,Beautiful Highlihetrs.,Nice Highlighters at fairly reasonable price. Bright and Beautiful Color. Nice and right amount of flow. Sharpie highlightes are the best. I recommend these highlighters to everyone.
1,Fun NOT! if the parent has to use it...,"and you will because the younger kids will have no patience for this toy. The machine has to be primed and when the seal breaks (about every time) you have to start over and prime the device again. Plus my plastic hoses where knife sliced when I opened the box and had to use electrical tape to fix the hoses. Tell a 4 year old their new toy is broken, Great fun. I'd return it in a second if I would have had a receipt. The best toy this company make is the straight bubble wand in the bottle manual use only - almost everything else is junk. My friends have other products. We been comparing,"
4,Now you're talkin' bubbles!,"This bubble maker is pretty good! Makes large bubbles that never cease to amaze kids. Of course, it's a little messy (especially when there's no breeze, the kids run with it) but that's all part of the fun!"
4,One Of the Better Bubble Makers,"Worked out of the box- it did what it said- the only downside is it sucks down the pricey bubble juice - and the dollar store brand does not work as well in it in case you were trying to ""beat the system"". It is so easy a 4.5 year old can use it- not clean it, just use it and leave it for you to clean up."
1,could not make it work!!,I bought this toy for my son who LOVES bubbles. I put it together and can not make it work. I checked it several times and the solution will not go all the way up. I gave it to my brother-in-law to check out and he could not make it work either. I can say that the Gazillion bubble solution is the best I have ever used.
3,the new ones can't highlight books,"I have used the Sanford highlighters for close to 20 years. there are nice. However, just yesterday I got some from a local store and it is now called ""Shapie by Sanford"". They are almost a disaster when highlighting textbooks. The wide brush is too wide. The side (the narrower brush) is really thin. So, I cannot highlight any books or textbooks and had to return them.I guess the new ones could be good for highlighting invoices or business computer printouts, but they may lose some customers who would like to highlight books."
4,Great ballroom dancing CD with strict tempo and good variety,"This is another good professionally produced CD with a selection of strict tempo numbers by the familiar Columbia Ballroom Orchestra and is worth having in your expanding music library. Fresh music is a must for the competition dancer whether amateur or professional. This disk provides enough variety to satisfy the most jaded dancer. May not be competition quality, as Gunter Noris and others, but well worth having for listening and practice. We compete in American Smooth and Rhythm since 1995. Beginners will also enjoy dancing to this easy listening music."
3,Pirate Costume,"Was disappointed that this costume was one size fits all, but was actually made for a large man. I would not order this costume if you are a woman or a medium size man. Other then that, it was well made."
3,Review,"I purchased 2 DVD's by Tanja Djelevic, the Total Body Cardio and the Total Body Sculpt. Well to my disbelief they were the same DVD. I love the tape but was very disappointed to find out I ordered the same item in a different title. What a rip off!!"
3,Ok workout but a little slow...,"I agree with another reviewer that ""cardio"" should be taken out of the title of this. The reviews of this are so good but it just did not do it for me. I have too many other dvds that are more motivating. All I can say is that it is a little slow if you are a high energy cardio addict like me. I have had it for many months but have only done it once. I even put it in this morning to give it another try and the preview was so boring I could not hit play. I liked the idea of cardio/toning/pilates/yoga fusion, but as I said it is a little slow. For a toning fusion with higher energy I recommend Crunch's Burn & Firm Pilates."
5,Love it,"I actually look forward to doing this workout (and I can't do it every day, because my muscles (every single one in my body) need to recover)! I think it has something to do with Tanja's positive, fun personality; with the variety that comes from combining aerobics, pilates moves, strength training, and yoga; and the sense of exercising outside in the sunshine in the gorgeous mountains of Utah (which is really motivating when the actual weather where I am is cold and gloomy). Definitely my favorite workout DVD, and I have a lot of them!"
3,Just ok,"I worked out to this dvd today. It was ok. The cardio piece was good. Then the instructor switched and said ok now time to work the upper body. WHAT ? The Cardio was intense enough, I am not overweight and work out regularly. It just seemed weird. I would not recommend. I will go back to Turbo Jam, Turbo Jam is great !!"
2,Ok but needs improvement,"Tanja Djelevic is very sweet and charming in the video but I am still not satisfy with her verbal instruction in the DVD. The instruction is not detail enough, it is not descriptive and the instruction is too fast and short. You have to see her each move in order to follow the trend.Other than that, it is a good workout."
3,Nice setting but LACKS cardio,"While I think this is a decent DVD, I was really expecting a lot more cardio. Unlike Tanja's Cardio BalanceBall DVD where I stayed in my heart rate training zone for most of the workout. My heart rate monitor did not indicate that with this workout. Also, my pedometer only indicated that I got in 1400 steps out of the daily 10,000 recommended steps. I think the title should have been changed to reflect that this DVD is predominantly a toning DVD.I enjoy Tanja as an instructor, and I do think that she incorporates a lot of dynamic movement into this intermediate level workout. She is positive, and you can tell that she truly enjoys health. I work out at least 6 days a week to fitness DVDs.I think I will only do this video about once a month or so.If you are a beginner/ intermediate exerciser who wants a serene workout for lighter days, you will enjoy this workout."
1,Be aware! This is exactly the same workout as Cardio Burn Sculpt!,Be aware! This is exactly the same workout as Cardio Burn Sculpt just with a different title. I bought two DVDs based on the title thinking they are two different workouts and very unhappy to find out they are exactly the same. Should this be allowed - repackaging the old tape and sell it under a new title as a new product?
5,Great fusion workout!,"I workout at a gym and at home using dvds four to five times a week. This workout, a yoga/pilates/cardio fusion, is so challenging and fun that I've been doing it instead of going to the gym! Tanja is great! She has energy, is encouraging (but not in a cheesy way), and she is an excellent instructor. Her cues and instruction are so clear that I was able to follow her the first time. She also gives very clear instructions for modifying each section so it is more or less challenging. The workout is exactly what the title says it is--a total body cardio workout. There is an option to use weights at times and all of the major muscle groups get used. The music is excellent and the scenery is wonderful. I have 3 of Tanja's dvds and plan to get her other 2 (not available at Amazon). I have an entire library of cardio, pilates, and yoga dvds, but Tanja's are definitely the best."
3,Undecided,"The author tries to hook a lot of complex phenomena into his proposals - which is perhaps understandable when taking into account the subject he is writing about - but in my view his book is frayed for it.The UFO/abduction phenomenon, NDEs and even God are touched upon, but never really given the depth or consideration they require. Instead of being asked if they would like to participate in this extra-dimensional theory business, and granted the respect of answering for themselves, they were apparently dragged along by the ear.The whole issue was not treated in spiritual enough a manner for my liking. You cannot tackle the subject of God and inner being and still try and be acceptably scientific: you need to ditch the labcoat wholeheartedly at the doorstep and walk in blindfolded.That said, a reasonable introduction to such things for those who are at a relevant level of ""discovery"". A bit lacking for those who have already made some headway though I feel."
2,"5 stars for Veronika, none for the rest","when Veronika enters the screen all I can say is, ""wow""! damn, she's one fine woman! I think she's beyond perfection! however, we have way too many idiotic scenes, over-acting, under-acting, not really acting at all & an absolutely proposterous plot if there is one. half-way through this film I'm asking myself, why am I even bothering with the rest of this crap? there's way too much going on & not enough Veronika cause she's the only reason to see this."
3,"Good product, could be a better price","These calcium pills are great because they give you enough calcium (taken 2 times a day) with vitamin D for absorption. However, they are difficult to swallow, and other brands, like gnc, offer the same product for a lower price per pill."
4,good,bought it for my father and my wife. bought it for my father and my wife. bought it for my father and my wife.
4,The best Sliders yet,"I was looking for sliders that were low cost, easy to install, and low in maintance and here are the best of them all. Very duarable and worked great for my project, Bed side end tables. I did have to buy screws for the install but after one year they are holding up perfectly."
1,What A Major Rip Off,"Hello Amazon,I purchased this album years ago and decided to write a review all these years later there is no difference between this album and Pies Descalzos. This CD is for special markets there is no difference in the music don't believe all the hype of remastered music. This listing for $170 is price gouging at its best. Buyer-beware rather than spending your money on this Gold Collection edition buy the original it is just as good. For everyone who doesn't know Shakira's career all of her records were re-released and re-mastered following her 2002 world wide hit Whenever,Wherever. This album was re-released in the United States only on January 25, 2002. Collection de Oro (Collection of Gold) is a series distributed by Sony Music compare this collection to one of many by Time Life Music.Thanks BUYER-BEWARE[...]"
4,Excellent album,I purchased this album after hearing Laundry Service and loving it. It is the American release of Pies... This album has more ballads than Laundry Service and they are all excellent. I'd highly recommend the album if you like her unique voice.
5,Roladisc,"With the cd collection that I have and continue to add to, this is probably the best system that I have seen on the market. The sleeves protect the cd from scratching and they just slide in and out or you can just pull the sleeve out and place in one of the other carrying cases. Your cds are always protected."
2,Great concept! -- Poor Execution,"This is a great idea that fully meets its advertised compactness and convenience. However, the quality of the construction is awful! -- a few wire staples is the sum total of the joinery. If you put more than a few CD's in it, it WILL fall apart. It's easy to drill holes and put wood screws in the corners or screw on a plywood base to hold it together, but if this is beyond your capabilities, you should probably not buy this product."
5,"Easy as 1, 2, 3...","The Roladisc Library is the easiest, most compact way to hold your cd collection. Very attractive. Get rid of all those annoying cd jewel cases and huge home cd stands. Slip the cd cover in front of the sleeve, then the cd in back. Alphabetize them, and your done. Going traveling? Then just slip the sleeve out of the library and into your CD Projects case. Easy! CD Projects are hard to find in stores. I've looked around the web a lot, and Amazon has one of the best selections and prices."
1,cheaply made for the price paid,"I just packed mine up to ship back. I agree with the reviewers that stated it was poorly constructed. The concept is good, but the execution is deplorable. My four year old could've broke this thing in half with his plastic hammer. Save the 40+ bucks (including shipping) and buy something else."
3,Best Song Off Homogenic,This song is pure poetry-evocative of so many emotions. Highly recommend you see the video representation of this song as well. My favorite mix is the Buzz Water mix.
1,Dr Seuss Kindergarten,"This product, Dr Seuss Kindergarten, really needs to be updated. It was incompatible with Mac OSX 10.5.8 and therefore disappointing to a little girl on Christmas morning."
2,Games are too long,"Overall the games are good and help the children learn however, they are a little too lengthy for their short attention spans. I work as a speech language pathologist in an elementary school with children pre-k to 3rd grade. I allow my students to play on the computer as a reward. They all enjoy playing the games but it takes so long to get through one game and if you exit your progress is not saved and you have to start over from the beginning. I often times will quickly finish the game for them to they can play a different game. I will get frustrated myself with the length. The game does have a chart that keeps track of the percentages for correct answers. This is great except for the color matching game. How can you keep a percent of correct guesses on a matching game. It is impossible for the student to get 100% or even 90% as you don't know where the colors are to begin with. Good learning overall but to long for a child's patience or even mine."
1,The Big Love is reall they big bore,OMG! This is got to be the most boring book I've ever attempted! When she start explaining the differences between Evangelical Christians and all other religions and why everyone hates Evangelical Christians my eyes actually glazed over! She just rambles on and on about stuff that has no bearing on the story. What tripe!
1,Would you like some cheese with that whine?,"Thank god this was a short novel because if the whining and psychobabble BS was longer than this, I might have not pushed through to the end. I was hoping the characters would develop and there would be substance and depth to each of them but clearly Sarah Dunn is incapable of that. It's also important for readers to note that this is her first novel (as stated in the book) or else I might be less forgiving. This novel was a poor first attempt at writing and I'm surprised that any publisher bothered to take it. It was a very ""woe is me"" approach to life and love and it made me want to pull my hair out. She makes Alison sound so pitiful and there's not enough about Tom for character development to even really hate him or understand him, or why she loves him. Boring book that shows the amateurishness of the author."
4,"just ""ok"" - a quick read","I agree with fuzzy ear's review below. The characters are quite average, so in a positive way a reader could easily relate. While it was a quick read, it was dull at times."
1,Like being trapped with a mad neurotic !,This book started off great but dissolved as the neurotic narrator became more and more neurotic and more and more annoying I was throughly sick of her complete narcissism by the end of the book .If you're looking for a breezy bittersweet summer read check out Cindy Chupack instead
5,Delighful read,"This book was a very refreshing, easy read. Alison is a fascinating character and it was a pleasure to take a peek into her world. Highly recommended reading. I look forward to the authors next novel."
5,Very Entertaining,"A quick, enjoyable, yet deep read. Ms. Dunn can really move a story forward and manages to tackle some deep internal issues through her protagonist. Anyone who grew up Evangelical and is left feeling somewhat weird after that experience will find a kindred spirit here, and those who did not will gain some insights in a very enjoyable way. I laughed out loud, cringed inwardly, shook my head, felt triumphantly understood, and even cried at times. This woman has a gift for expressing what is so difficult to express and making her reader delight in it."
4,"Literature, not Chick-Lit","Too many times when a woman writes a novel, some label it ""chick-lit""...I can only disagree in the sense that ""The Big Love"" as Sarah has given us is literature and not just some form of entertainment for those of the the female persuasion. This is a story that can - and does - trendsend time (in the 'written' sense) becoming a story that effects the affected...those who wish to be. I've found her story, the words she uses, to be entertaining as well as significant. No matter her words, the most important part how she expresses herself, is exquisite. Maybe I'm too much a fan of open-dialogue-storytelling, but she is (tempting with brilliance) open and forward with her thoughts. This reveals the characters to be fresh and everlasting. As I may say a good reading if not a great way to feel what innner thoughts you may have yourself. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys solid stories about relationships and how they effect us. That and it's a great read."
2,I really wanted to like this book but...,"I bought this book partly because of the quote about it being like a Sex and the City highlights reel and how funny it was. I'm sorry, but where is the funny parts in this book because I found none. Now I'm a huge fan of Sex and the City and I have laughed quite a bit at it even if I have seen the episode 5 times but not once did I laugh or found anything remotely funny in this book. I think that Sarah Dunn is just trying too hard to be hip but it just doesn't work. The main character, Alison, got on my nerves after awhile. All she seem to do was complain and go on and on about her Christian backround. After awhile, I felt like telling her to shut up because noone really cares. The whole book was a complete letdown and I had to fight to finish it. I would avoid this one if you are looking for a good book."
2,"The big ""eh""","This novel is easy to read and even a bit amusing in parts, but it is lacking description, or any real character development, and the plot is predictable and mediocre. There's a big marketing push for the book, but it's really not worth the hype.For good women's fiction, check out Sarah Salway, Kathleen Tessario, and Lisa Jewell. Those women know how to write great stories and write them beautifully."
2,Not nearly as good as promised,"This book is not great, really not great. It is decent, but not nearly what I was expecting. The cover says that it is a highlight reel from Sex and the City, one of my very favorite shows, but it was so opposite of SaTC, that I can't even understand the comparison. The main character doesn't live in NYC, and doesn't write a column about sex, but does write a column. It's about a girl, one who hates her evangelical Christian background, so she has sex with a couple guys, but it isn't about loving the man, it's about wanting not to be a Christian. I finished it to find out what ends up happening, but I was REALLY dissapointed. Don't but this if you are looking for a fun read or if you don't hate evangelical Christians."
5,loved this book,"I hate flying, but I read this book on the plane and ended up enjoying my flight because of it. The voice of the main character was smart, funny and engaging. I recommend it!"
2,"bah, borrow it instead of wasting your money.","after reading the summary to this book i thought it'd be fantastic. well, it was far from that. (thank goodness for book trading!) i always finish a book even if it's just pretty unbearable to read. it started out slow and didn't grab my attention. once i got to the middle there were 2-3 chapters that were quite page turners, but then it turned sour again, kind of like that bad taste in your mouth. the story jumped too much around and she always exaggerated on things (complaining a lot about her evangelical-christian childhood, ect.) that i don't think really should be exaggerated on in this story (just didn't seem to fit, not that i have problems with religion), so that was another turn off to this book. although i was glad for the book to end, the ending seemed rather abrupt rather than a slow ease into the main characters farewell."
4,I liked It,"This was an odd little book, certainly not the typical ""chick lit""-- there were no MADCAP adventures or SAVE THE CITY plots that a HIP CHICK stumbles upon. A bit different, easy to read, and though lacking ""laugh out loud"" humor, it was quietly enjoyable."
2,More like a comedy routine than a book,"I listen to books on tape/CD at work to pass the day. This book was funny from the first word to the last, but it has no substance. It's like listening to a comedy routine. I didn't care when her boyfriend left her, or when they got back together. I didn't care about one person in the book. If you're looking for something funny (but that's it) to read this is the book for you, if you want more skip it."
4,quick fun read,"I read this book in a day. It was a fun, light book. Interesting insights into evangelical christians (and the mormons next door with a trampoline - very funny!) The story was engaging and well written. The character of Alison seemed very realistic. The book could have been longer; the writing was so entertaining, I would have loved to continue reading about Alison and her life."
4,"""The Big Love""","I listened for it in the car - great for mindless reading on your way from work! Pretty non-typical, a times funny and bold. I enjoyed it."
1,"Not well written, boring, couldn't wait til it was over","I'm so disappointed. I read this book because it was recommened by an author I really like, Emily Giffin. This book was horrible. I kept reading on because I thought if Emily Giffin liked it, surely it was going to get better. The author went on and on about nonsense. Mid way through the book I began skipping paragrahs, and found I missed none of the story line. I should have known from the first few chapters, it was not going to be worth my time. I couldn't identify with, love, or hate any of the characters. There was no WOW in the book, no climax. It was the author's first book, perhaps she'll do better with time. However, I don't plan on looking for a novel by her in the future."
1,Total waste of my time,"There was no actually romance in this book or even comedy. It was completely boring. There were a lot of thinking and self talking, which at times put me to sleep. The only good thing about this book was that the heroine wasn't as stupid as I thought she was. She woke up in the end. Thank God! I thought I was going to have to write a hate letter to this author for creating such a dumb and desperate character."
3,The Big Love,"I am enjoying the story so far. I am listening to the audio version and my only criticism is that the reader, Eliza Foss, sounds much much older than the character. I have a daughter who is 32 and Ms. Foss sounds over 40. For some reason this is very distracting to me."
4,AN EXCELLENT WORKOUT!,This is a great sculpting dvd! I wish it were longer. This is one of my favorite Prevention dvds.
3,Not exactly what I was looking for.,More aerobic than I was expecting. I was looking for more strength building and cardio. Not for a beginer. I like Chris Freitag's strength circuits better.
2,This will get you moving,"The dvd is broken down to a quick warm-up, a 10 minute cardio/strength workout, a 10 minute pilates workout, a 10 minute kickboxing workout and a quick cool down. Weights are needed for the cardio and pilates workouts. They advise 2 or 3 pounds, but you can also use a heavier weight. If you use a heavier weight, Chris Freytag advises that you will fatigue. She gives good advise and shows ""how to"" thru out the workouts that a beginner or an advanced exerciser can use. Because the workouts are in 10 minute segments, you don't get bored and things are definitely moving."
4,Chris always delivers,"You can't go wrong with Chris Freytag leading your workout session. This DVD is great for beginners and advanced alike, though it would benefit from an additional 10 minute section. This is an effective, well-rounded workout, but intermediate and advanced exercisers may not find it particularly challenging. I also think they should have put the pilates segment at the end, because that way you won't have to take your shoes off only to put them back on. I supplement this 30 minute workout to meet my daily exercise quota."
2,Disappointed,"I have several Prevention DVDs, and I like them, but I didn't like this one. Even though I am an advanced excersiser, I am 43 years old, and throwing weights around at the speed shown on this dvd is a good way to get hurt. The whole thing seems disjointed to me, and I thought it was dumb to put the Pilates section in the middle. Who wants to stop and take their shoes off, and then put them back on again? There are a lot better dvd's out there that accomplish the same thing."
3,a good try,"this is a great workbook for people who have the time for a lot of writing and reflection -- and willpower to stay on track. an avid reader and searcher for all things pertaining to the treatment of eating disorders, i did not find this book to be much help above and beyond what you normally read in all the other ""self help"" books. Basically, it summarizes the other books and puts it into question/answer form. it also does not go into each area deeply enough to provide what i would consider lasting effects of treatment from the reflection. a good therapist and support group and/or network of support will do better than this book."
1,Nothing New!,"Besides the fact that this is totally overpriced, there is nothing in this workbook that I have not read before. Many of the exercises are in other workbooks that I have already purchased. Although I believe the author tried to convince the readers that she understands what it is like to have an eating disorder, I am not sure that she really does understand. I have reviewed many workbooks for eating disorders and this is one of my least favorites."
1,"A lot of the same material, done again","I think the concept of the book is a great one, but it would be helpful to talk more about recovery from a personal perspective.The book has a lot of material that I have read before, it is just rewritten a different way.I also think it is too pricey."
2,Highly problematic--perhaps the Win/Solaris/linux dist works,"I do not know what others experienced, but running this patch CD ruined my linux experience. (1) SuSE linux 8.0 still does not recognize my PCMCIA cards, (2) when running StarOffice 6.0 I got error messages: ""/opt/staroffice6.0/work does not exist"" and fatal errors when trying to load MS Office files from my windows/c partition--SO 5.2 did it flawlessly, by the way--and when trying to create new files the templates could not be found anywhere.In other words--this particular distribution of StarOffice 6.0 did not appear to load/install properly and does not appear to function even adequately. Some of you linux wizards might say, ""Well, just tweak, tweak, tweak."" Fine. If you have the time. And why should one have to, anyway? It should install and work properly. Period.I am still willing to give the ""standard"" SO 6.0 distribution a try. But I wish I had saved the money this time around."
5,Revenge with a twist,"Hautman usually writes books that combine comedy and larceny. Rag Man is less humorous than his preceding books, but no less entertaining. The fact that the two central characters both have redundant names, Mac Macwray and Lars Larson, tells the reader that not everything that happens should be taken seriously. Mac and Lars were partners in a garment business, hence the title of the book, but when Lars takes off with company funds Mac discovers he was taken by a con artist who set him up from the start. Mac undergoes a major personality changed during the novel, effectively turning into Lars. The plot is laced with sex, murder, blackmail, and other assorted goodies. Rag Man is a quick and entertaining read that doesn't disappoint Hautman fans."
4,families should love it,"Harbhajan Mann is OK , but he doesn't suit the role of the college boy, and looks way too old, Jimmy Shergill would have been the idle choice and his dialogue delivery is terrible. he needs to polish up his acting, Neeru Bajwa has more footage then Mahek, she was also really good and convincing. Mehek Chahal doesn't come after the interval, she does excellent in the scenes she does have and her chemistry with Harbhajan Mann is mindblowing. Dara Singh does well as well, Deep Dhillion as the father does make a impact, Kawaljit doesn't have much to do and Aman Noori is good as well. overall this film is rich in emotions and is one of the better family dramas made in India, families should love it. More punjabi films should be made like these, so rent the DVD today!!!"
3,Typical Harbhajan Mann movie,"Whether I compare this movie to the better Jee Aayan Nu or Asa Nu Maan Watna Da or rate this as a separate movie - it deserves 3 stars.If you have watched either of Harbhajan Mann's previous movies, you pretty much know what to expect. The story and dialogue in his previous movies is better, in this movie, it is ok. The sound track is very nice and I would recommend buying the CD. The movie itself if worth a watch for some light hearted family entertainment and to watch the always entertaining Ghuggi. Ghuggi is not as funny in this movie though as he usually his."
3,Mellow Mystery,"A girl named Janie goes to visit her great aunt Cissie in her big old house, and notices right away that Aunt Cissie is not her usual, cheerful self. Instead she is nervous and gloomy, and it's not long that Janie discovers that Aunt Cissie has been getting threating notes in the mail, like ""I AM WATCHING YOU"". More harrasments follow, like a break-in and frequent phone calls. Janie and her aunt wonder about all possible people who could be doing this and Janie helps solve the mystery.This is a mellow mystery, not really violent at all. I think it is written for children grades 3-6. I was expecting a teen novel when I bought it since I have enjoyed 2 of Carol Beach York's novels for teens."
3,too time consuming,"The body and face pads are completely useless. I've used them several times in the same places and the hair always grows back. However the probe method of removal does actually work. Unfortunately you can only remove one hair at a time with this method. It really does work. You just have to have a lot of time, patience and dexterity in order to see the results."
4,Works EXACTLY as the information that comes with this product says it will.,"I bought this ePen a couple months ago, and it's working exactly as was stated in the pamphlet that comes with this product. It takes multiple uses to achieve permanent hair loss. That is fully explained in detail in the instructions, as well as how to properly use this product.I noticed after only two applications on my lip, MUCH slower hair growth than before. Extremely pleased. Same for bikini line. I will continue to use this product and am happy thus far with the results.My advice, don't be impatient, and READ the directions, ALL the directions."
4,So far so good,"So far, the hair I removed is not growing back. The holidays were hectic and I have not had alot of time of work with the product. Each hair takes about 1 minute to process so patience is required. Painless and effective:)"
1,NOT PERMANENT HAIR REMOVAL,"I purchased this product because the ad says it is permanent hair removal. I used it for months and the hair continues to grow back. The best thing I can say for it is that it makes waxing painless. Once you use the pad on the affected area, the hair slides out painlessly after applying wax. Good for bikini or underarm waxing. That's about all it is good for."
1,don't buy,doesn't work. rip-off. you will regret purchase. put a vibrating cell phone to your face if you want the same feeling and results. i can't believe this product can actually be sold.
1,not enough info,"I bought this product in hopes of saving money and I can't even use it. I have epilepsy. There wasn't any indication on the site that made think that I should avoid this product because of my disability. It was after I received it that this problem became clear I shouldn't use the Eglide. I don't like to whine and throw it in everyones face that I have epilepsy, but it really sucks when I waste a bunch of money because companies are insensitive like this. Thanks for nothing Verseo!"
1,Ive never felt so betrayed by a tv commercial,"I was fascinated by the claims they make on their commercials,""easy, fast,effective and clinically proven"". I chose to buy this over a rotary epilator. There wasnt even a single doubt bone when I ordered my set in febuary this year, I also ordered a total of 42 replacement pads thruout the months. I treated only my underarms and face, and i did it like the instructions red,20 mins, twice a week on clean dry skin. I also got several tweezermans to tweeze my hair after each treatment. This has been going on for almost 5 months, my hairgrowth is still abundent and I have totally lost faith in it.I wished it could have at least console me with some results for the faith and time ive put it, it doesnt have to be significant, but just some would be enough for some consolation.I hope some good authority could prevent them from duping other gullible consumers any further.This product isnt even worth 1 star.I hope this helps."
1,Bogus,"This is the second product (with the same purpose) from Folica that I have tried. Both have given bogus results. The first was the electrolysis with the needle (painful), and this one is without. To use this product, you have to have LOTS of time on your hands.Pro: It's needle free.Cons: Time consuming, does not give quick results, you can only treat a small area at a time (even with the pads)."
1,Don't be fooled!! NO GOOD!,"Don't listen to bogus reviews!! I, too was betrayed by that first review of the product! This was a terrible product. At first you feel like it's doing something. But in reality, it's doing nothing but giving you headaches. Instead of getting rid of hairs, it makes more grow. I had to give up and go to a professional electrolysis. I suggest never to use this product. NO GOOD!"
