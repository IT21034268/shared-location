2,Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley,"Not nearly as electrifying as the first book. Too many points of view take away from the main characters, who act and speak so out of character, it is no longer a continuation of the novel we all now. It is a stand alone, steamy at times, romance novel. It was probably, though, meant as such, since there are clearly explanations of things that otherwise would have been known to readers. But still a fun read if you like to know what happens next."
1,Total Bore,"A bad rehash of her excellent ""Mr Darcy Takes a Wife."" Couldn't even get through it. No more Linda Berdoll for this reader."
4,"well written, but","All of Berdoll's novels that I have read are well written. The ending left many threads dangling. Is there another in the series? The former mistress is unmarried, Georgiana is yet at Rosings.This book is set after Darcy, Fitzwilliam and Georgiana return from France, but can be read as a stand-along"
1,NO THANKS.,"I tried to read the first one, and was sooo glad I ckecked it out of the library and did not spend any money on that book.It was so bad, there is no way I am going to waste time to even look at this one.This is another great reason to use your library first. If you read it and love it, then go spend your hard earned money and buy the book. I feel this one will be just a sad as the last one. Darcy and Lizzy deserve much better than this."
4,Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley,"I enjoyed this book nearly as much as the one before it. Although I do think that some it is a bit more vulgar than necessary, overall I enjoy reading more about Darcy and Elizabeth and their lives together. The first book seemed to tie up all the loose ends pretty well so this one needed to untie them, as it were, in order to tell the stories. Once you get past all the back-tracking it moves along fairly well. Perhaps not exceptional literature, but entertaining none the less. I want to be swept away by a book and lose time when I read; this one does that."
3,A good rainy day read,"I loved Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife and was ready for this sequel! But I was disappointed by the overuse of description and repeating of what happened in the first book. The book has a good plot and great ending, but a very slow start."
4,"So sexy, Mr. Darcy!","Wow, this book's steaming hot that it influenced me to romance my husband and love on him. This book will show a strong and masculine Mr. Darcy that you will want to read about many times over!"
4,Liked it,"I liked this book. I thought that Berdoll contiued to make the characters grow, I liked that she touched on(in the very brginning)the uneasiness and the changes that occur after childern a born, the changed body and not knowing for sure what to make of each other, that is a real thing that couples married with children go through, I personally connected to that, I liked that this story was not constantly fraught with peril, I liked getting to see the different dynamics between the husbands and wives and brothers and sisters...and so on. The everyday of life, with a whole lot of passion and love mixed in. I think this book is a very nice compliment to the first and I thoroughly enjoyed it, once again JA purists will hate it but if you have an open mind you might just enjoy it!"
3,Romantic and Sexy,"Darcy really loves Lizzy. All women want to be loved like he loves her!!! With that said their are some dry spots in the book and to many characters to keep up with!!! The Print in the book should have been larger, so that people with poor eye sight could read it with out strain."
3,"Yes, Some Village Has Lost Its Idiot","I bought this book, knowing that it was a poor second to 'Mister Darcy Takes A Wife', but I wanted to see what happened to Wickham. This book continues with inaccuracies as to details set forth in Pride and Prejudice. For example, it states that Kitty is one year older than Lydia (page 118), when everyone knows that Kitty is two years older than Lydia. However, the error to which the title of this review refers, is unique to this book. In Chapter 68, while out riding, Darcy and Elizabeth take shelter, from a rain storm, in a barn. Darcy loosens the saddle girths to allow the horses to rest. When the shepard arrives, thinking he has wool thieves in the barn, Darcy and Elizabeth make a mad dash for their horses, jump into the saddles, and gallop off, without tightening the saddle girths. Yes, some village has lost its idiot. howeveratile of"
1,"Please, people, this is complete rubbish","I have never picked up a worse book in my life. My wife and i enjoyed the first book, ""Mr. Darcy Takes A Wife,"" so we bought this one. DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE WE DID!!! There is a very weak plot, after she spent half of the book repeating the first book. She couldn't even make up her mind if Darcy's mother's name was Elinor, as in the last book, or Ann, as in this one. Whatever fits into the story goes. I don't mind sex, but I do require some sort of plot or at least one interesting character. I read one of the reviewers saying it was one dimensional, but I think they were being nice, I can't find any dimension at all. I wouldn't buy this book, nor recommend it. I have no idea why anybody would write or publish this. Did literature become Hollywood, where nonsense sequel can get away just because of the succesful original?"
3,disappointment,"I had been looking forward to this sequel as the first was absolutely tops!!! But the first half of the book is a repeat of what had happened in the first book (Bar Sinister) and the second half the author is so busy with all her euphemisms that it looses the plot all together.There is hardly a plot in it anyway. And where does the spelling of ""kilt"", ""stopt"" (killed, stopped) comes from? I read it, but won't read it again as I did with the first one. (many times)A disappointment!!!!"
5,Captivating!,"If you enjoyed Ms. Berdoll's first book, you will not be disappointed with this sequel. However, if you are a P&P purist and/or disliked Ms. Berdoll's first book, kindly refrain from reading this sequel. I too hope Ms. Berdoll writes a third book!!"
1,Don't bother!,"This has to be one of the most REPETITIVE and BORING books I have ever attempted to read. I say ""attempted"" because try as I might, I just cannot bring myself to finish it. I have struggled to get half-way through and the author has still done nothing but re-hash the events from her first sequel ""Mr Darcy Takes a Wife"" which, although full of the most unbelievable story plots and character assassinations, was still a fairly interesting read once I accepted the author's apparent obsession with Darcy and Elizabeth's sex life.Unfortunately, I purchased both of Berdoll's sequels at the same time, otherwise I would never have bought this one after reading the author's first attempted sequel.On a positive note, I have finally decided to give up finishing this book - life's just too short. I am thinking of selling it but I don't think I could in all honesty even give it away with a clear conscience.Most seriously disappointed."
2,Repetitive rehash,"I loved Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife and didn't want to see it end. So I was delighted to see another sequel by the same author. Unfortunately this one just continually rehashes previous material in slightly different ways. The storyline jumps all over the place, contradicts itself, and does not feel cohesive. Perhaps better editing would have made this a worthwhile read. While Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife will find a permanent spot on my bookshelf, Days and Nights at Pemberley will not.I do hope to see more from Berdoll. Perhaps she should take on a sequel to the characters in Emma."
1,waste of time,"I love Pride and Prejudice. I couldn't wait to find out what became of Elizabeth and Darcy. If you want to read about the 101 ways they had sex go ahead and read this book. BORING, DULL, REPETITIVE...."
1,a nice cover,"the only thing good about this sequel and worse Miss Berdoll's next one is the lovely art on the covers. I enjoy a 'romance' every once in a while but when deciding to read these I expected, hoped to 'hear' Darcy and Elizabeth in Austens 'voice' or at least one of the many filmed versions. This book was a terrible disappointment, I stupidly read both because I have the inane compulsive need to finish and complete things. I could not write as beloved Austen, I would hope someone who had the gall to would do a better job. I'm not even sure I should give these books away they are that bad, I should have read the previous reviews."
1,Are you kidding me!,"I think the art of Austen's irony is totally lost on Berdoll. One piece of advice, find your own characters! We all love Elizabeth and Darcy, but they are the product of another persons imagination.One last thing, what kind of line is, ""he was in high dudgeon""? That was one of the dumbest lines I have ever read. I am pretty sure no one in England has read these books, because there have been no reports of head explosions."
2,Sequel to a Sequel,"Of all the sequels to Pride and Prejudice, I thought Bar Sinister (also released as ""Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife"") was the most original and well-written of the lot. Unfortunately, that originality is missing from Darcy & Elizabeth: Nights and Days at Pemberley. Linda Berdoll spends most of the book rehashing scenes from her first sequel and from the original Austen novel. Fully the first third of the novel is recapitulation of Bar Sinister. The entire novel feels old and tired and lacking imagination. I wouldn't bother with this one."
5,best of rayl lynch,"My review of ray lynch is always the same, the man is unblievable good. I just wish he would give some new products to enjoy"
4,Very good CD for New Age,"A friend told me about Ray Lynch, and I bought this on his recommendation. He was right; although the CD is inconsistent (some instrumentals are very good while others are not), the CD is well worth the money. I have a machine that transfers music from one CD to another, and for my purpose the music was great (an ipod would probably work as well). If you like New Age music (people like Enya, Jesse Cook, etc), you will probably like some of his cuts."
4,Great generic product,"This is my first guitar and mass produced non-synthesizer type of instrument so I don't have much to go by. However, as a generic bass guitar and for the price, it seems well made and produces a pleasant bass sound. I'd say it is worth buying as a package. Everything that came with is useful. Although the bag is probably only useful for preventing the guitar from gathering dust."
3,nice rocking,"It is very good looking and it looks more expensive, amplifier is so, so and good for beginners, the only problem was the cable missing in my order to hook up the bass guitar to the amplifier. other than that it is ok."
2,Try other beginner bass.,"Pretty hard to play for beginner bass. It's too expensive for the quality it provides. I suggest that you look up craigslist for used bass and amp sale. Yamaha and Fender squire make better beginner bass than Silvertone package. I have had this for 3 years and finally got an albanez bass and fenders amp to replace.After using it on daily basis, these are my opinions:Pros:The color is great for this bass, and the shipping was fast. Everything was included in the picture, easy transaction.Cons:The bass does not have many frets, and the neck doesn't stay straight. I had a professional friend to fix it for me and the first string still rattles like crazy after a few weeks. When it doesn't rattle is when we loosen the neck and it was so hard to press down the string.The tuner does not work period.The Amp produces very small sound, and after 1 year of usage it makes some weird noises on it's own."
3,Damaged,"I bought this from Amazon because the price could not be beat anywhere else. It was shipped very fast and the package was intact.However, two things were wrong with the guitar:1. The tuner for the high G string was stripped inside. The string could not be tuned. I had to replace this myself. Easy fix but it cost me about $20 to order a package of 4 new tuners from eBay.2. The setup was high and the head of the intonation screw for the A string was stripped and could not be moved. It actually looked like the head was manufactured defective.I fixed these things myself (actually, I left the intonation of the A string a little sharp because it was off by just a very very little bit).My only recourse would have been to return the bass for a refund but I decided to keep it and do the repairs myself.Not a realistic option for most people, I'd guess.Other than that, the bass is very nice. I wanted a cheap bass to learn on. Silvertone quality control is just lax."
4,Bass Guitar Package,This was for my 12 yo boy. He likes it very much. It's a complete setup ready to go. It's a little better package that we think was worth the extra money. The amp sounds great. The case is pretty lite weight. We got another case for travel. I would recommend it.
3,Dissapointed,"I got this for the price, it was very nicely priced for everything it had to offer. I've only got a little bass experience (I'm a drummer) so I didn't want to buy a very pricey high end bass. I also got this for the amp, since I don't own one, and what good is a bass without an amp? Anyway, I received it very quickly and everything works well! The bass looks is quite classy in appearance. HOWEVER, the amp it came with won't turn on! I'm so bummed! What a let down."
1,Bait n switch,"This is my first review and feel bad its a negative one. After shopping around for months I finally found the bass I wanted. The picture of the Silvertone LB11 showed a Cobalt/Dark Blue body, gold bridge, gold strings, gold keys, all gold hardware and lettering. The look of gold on dark blue sold me. When the bass arrived it wasn't the same one depicted in the picture, no gold anything, all silver. It's said a picture is worth a thousand words, but in this pictures case its just one word, deceptive! One very,very disappointed customer.Silvertone LB11 Bass & Amp Package, Cobalt/Dark Blue"
3,Hm,"For a while it seemed that the bass was quite all right, but after a few short weeks of playing it a string started buzzing terribly. Mind you, not due to improper use or tuning. To say the least, rather disappointing. The other aspects seem to work well though."
3,Barely OK,"This bass guitar set is of questionable quality, however it may be OK for a child. Regardless, Amazon.com did it's very best to right every wrong and correct every problem. Amazon.com's professional handling of ""maybe not the best quality"" merchandise, may make purchasing this bass guitar set work for you."
3,Poor quality,"The Amp is ok and even the bass isn't awful, but the fret nut broke right away, and I've seen that problem discussed here and elsewhere."
5,Love It,I recently purchased this exact starter kit and it has been worth every penny. The bass looks very sleek and sounds great. The DVD that it comes with will get you started on the basics of playing. Even the amp puts out a lot of sound and sounds clear for how small it is. I highly recommend this purchase for beginners like myself.
4,Not to Bad. For a starter.,"I got this Bass for my ten year old son. We got it very fast and in good condition. I had to do a lot of adjustment with no directions. After an hour of messing around with the bridge I found the neck adjustment, then it went much better. I have a couple of six string guitars and I've never had a guitar with a neck adjustment, so it's a case of not knowing how to adjust the neck without directions. For as cheap as the price is this is a good guitar for a starter. If I had one gripe it would be to include instructions on how to adjust it in detail. Rock on."
4,great starter setup,"excellent price, sounds not bad either, has everything you need for the budding musician"
4,bass guitar,This was a Christmas gift for my son. It came very late but he was still elated. he loves it.
5,My Son Loves It!,I bought this for my 13 year old son that wants to leard how to play the base. It looks exactly as advertised and sounds great. The bass looks much more expensive that it is and I particularly like the sunburst colors. I am contemplating buying myself one so I can learn the bass.
4,nice,"The bass itself was very good. It has a really nice sound to it. It took a little less than two weeks to arrive. Packaging for the product was beaten up and torn all over, but the bass came in great shape despite the poor packaging conditions. Other than the packaging, my only complaint is that I ordered the Cobalt blue bass for my daughter and instead they sent the black! She was really disappointed that it wasn't the one she wanted, but she likes the black bass none the less."
5,GREAT!!!,"Exactly what I wanted!! It came before the expected shipping date!! It the best birthday gift I have received yet!! Everything came in great shape, it comes just like the picture says and it has everything it suppose to come with. Totally worth it!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Worst buy I have ever made.My advice to to never even glance towards the picture. LOLIt was warped and unplayable. Had to send back.Take this advice. PLEASE, its not worth it!"
2,INCOMPLETE PACKAGE,"THE BASS AND EVERYTHING THAT CAME WITH IT WAS AWESOME BUT THE MANUFACTURER DID NOT SHIP THE BUNDLE WITH THE CONNECTION TO BASS AMP, THEY NEVER EMAILED OR CALLED ME BACK ABOUT AND AMAZON ALSO DID NOTHING...SO NOW I'M RUNNING AROUND TRYING TO FIND THE DAMN THING! :O("
4,"Silvertone LB11 Bass & Amp Package, Sunburst",The item was received very quickly. When my daughter opened the package we noticed that one of the nobs on the front was not turning properly and the strap nob on the bottom of the guitar is loose. Overall the appearance is just as described. The coloring is beautiful.
1,don't bother,bought this and took it to be set up at the guitar center it is not worth it went there and wnded up getting a better guitar at the same price no amp but I would rather but it spererate and have a bass that works and sounds good not just throw $ at the wind and have a piece of junk to show for it. ;(
1,never,"silvertones suck. theyre heavy. as in weighs a lot. but they're pretty, if thats all you're going by."
4,Very nice Beginner Bass,"I recieved this for Christmas to try and learn how to play the bass. I have been practicing with this bass around a hour to an hour and a half a every day with no problems. The instruction dvd was worth watching once and thats about it. The tuner works but you need to know that each string has a light then you tune it between the flat and sharp scale, which never playing before i didn't understand at first. Also the picks are useless most base players play with their fingers and this is even the way they show you in there dvd. Overal Its perfect for someone like me that wants to try and learn an instrument without paying 300-700 just for a good bass guitar."
2,Cheap Accessories Okay Bass,"I got this bass for my son and this is what he wrote. The amp, cable, and bass are okay but the rest is very cheap.The bass won't go in and out of the bag easily. The tuner broke in a week and the video doesn't really help. The strap wore out in couple of months and snapped while I was playing. The bass broke on the inside in the first week of playing (my uncle fixed it). This bass is good if you aren't sure if you are going to stick to playing bass."
5,Great 1st Bass,This bass has been perfect for me to begin with! I even used it at my first gig - YAY! I did buy the Hal Leonard book which has been a better learning tool than the included DVD and I also bought a better gig bag. I just recently bought a more heavy duty cable since I started to hear some cracking noises with the one that was included. HOWEVER - this is SUCH a great deal and has been such a great guitar for me to get started with. I highly recommend for any beginner!
2,Annoying,"We've had this napkin holder for about 4 years and finally can't take it anymore. The napkins fall through the bottom if you try to move it from the counter to the table and sometimes they even fall out the sides. Opt for a holder that has a real bottom if you plan on moving it ever,"
2,"Attractive, but didn't really hold my napkins","This napkin holder is very attractive, but so large it only works if it's filled almost completely, in which case it's hard to get the napkins out. If it isn't filled completely, the napkins flop over, (which just looks sad,) and they slip out. The napkins I'm referring to are square and thin, ""casual"" napkins, that you buy in 100's or more, not the luncheon napkins shown in the picture that generally come in 10 or 25 in the party section at the store. I imagine it would be fine for those."
4,Very pretty,"This is really much better than the one I use to have (a plastic thing-a-majig from Ikea). It's heavier than it would seem, and you can pull out one nepkin at a time instead of pulling one and having them all come out. It doesn't look as nice when it's not full, but still looks better than most."
5,Gorgeous and sooooo soft.......,This is absolutely gorgeous and the material is beyond soft. It is a dream (pun intended). I feel like a princess sleeping on it! Fast delivery.
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"I received this as a gift, thinking that it would be an acceptable way of listening to my old LPs, but it's incredibly lacking in sound quality. There is no low end at all. The unit sounds worse than a 40 year old transistor radio with a 2 inch speaker."
1,DONT GET IT!!!,I got this and it worked for about 5 minutes. I tried the cd player and it doesn't read burnt disks. So now I'm taking it back.
1,Save your money.,"The feeder is suspended from a hanging fitting in a flexible plastic top piece that attaches to the glass bottle through threads moulded into both the top and the bottle. The threads barely engage, and the holding strength is poor. When I filled the bottle and hung it on my patio, the glass bottle pulled out of the plastic top after about an hour. The bottle fell and broke, spreading hummingbird nectar all about."
1,IBM computers suck,I have owned IBM pc's and laptops before and they have all been cheeply made and didn't perform. Neither does this.
3,Floormats,Floormats are slick on the back so they slide around. There should be little cleats or something to keep the mats in place.
5,more deserving,"An Austin treasure. Saw Ethan Ezarian stomping foot pedals one night at Stubb's and became an absolute MOTHERS fanatic. Nothing preconceived about any of this. Silly (but heartwarming) lyrics behind a wall of sound that will knock you off your feet. Really. If you aren't lucky to own a copy of TRADITIONAL LOVE, PLANE CRASH CITY, or BIG BLUE HOUSE (there are probably others I don't know of) this compilation will at least give you an idea of what they are all about.1. Heaven2. Aliens3. Traditional Love4. Family Affair5. The Kid's Don't Know6. Roller Coaster Girl7. Candy Clover8. Country Song9. Rudy10. Nancy11. Fairgoers12. Promised Land13. Young Girl In Love"
2,"Too long for my ""standard cradle""...","I bought this cradle bumper and found it was a few inches too long to securely fit my standard size cradle (18""x36""). I had to return it because I felt the excess bumper posed a safety hazard. Otherwise, it was nice."
3,Superficial and unoriginal,"If you've gotta have a book you can hold in your hand, then I guess this would OK. However I didn't find it particularly insightful. You can find the same information all over the web just by doing a Google search."
1,Save your money,"This book promises something that it can't deliver. There are so many gaps in this book that I was left with dozens of unanswered questions.Additionally, this book seems outdated. There are better cat books available now that offer much more accurate, up-to-date information on how a cat's mind works."
3,It's Alright,Pretty soft...still feels like cheap polyster..but it's better than having your hair snag on cotton or picking up lent I guess...definetly not top of the line though.
2,Terrible Quality,"The fabric is soft and silky, but the quality is terrible. The fabric is very thin and the thread lines on the pillow cases were not sewed straight, and one has an obivious sewing mistake that looks really bad. I rarely sew, but I could have done a better job at making these myself."
3,Poor Quality,"As soon as I received these pillowcases, I washed them once and used them for 2 weeks. Under normal pillow use habits, one of the pillowcases is nearly unraveled to the point of trashing it. The other one has begun to show signs of wear and tear as well. However, I'm not complaining too much for the price of $5"
3,"Good for the money, not spectacular","Well for a few bucks it did what I wanted, kept my hair from being all frizzy. I dont think I would call it ""Royal Opulence"", but if you want really nice quality, you will need to pay a little more."
3,Good for the price...,I use this pillowcase not for decoration but just to protect my hair when I sleep. It's held up pretty well after a couple of handwashings...you can't beat it for the price!
1,DOES NOT WORK,I bought this product to help curb my appetite and instead it made me HUNGRIER!! This product must not have the sufficient amount of hoodia to work because it did nothing for me.
2,Too elementary for the Young Adult section,"I disagree with most of the other reviews here. As a lifelong reader of fiction and fantasy I think this book is below the reading level of most teenagers. It's not bad--these are generally decent authors who have been selected--it's only that these stories are very elementary.Of the entire bunch I was only impressed by the very last entry, written by Ford. ""The Green Word"" as the only story with more to offer than standard myopic fantasy ramblings.All in all I think this collection would be wonderful for a very young reader, if a bit challenging. (One of the joys of reading.) For teens it would be read and discarded in a night or two. For adults you could probably read it while still inside the library or bookstore."
4,Green and Refreshing,"The short story is a dreadfully difficult art to master. Most collections have but one or two tales truly worth reading---and this collection is no different---there are perhaps two stand-outs. But, and this is the important thing: almost every story in this book captures the essence of the mythic Greenwood in a new vision. A few of the stories are remarkable for their sheer playful writing, and I wonder if this is merely the nature of the genre (fantasy/sf/speculative), or of genre writing (or writers)? Or perhaps a little bit of childhood wonder infects YA-level works? Whatever it is, it is worth reading. Go sit in the hammock, under the trees, and read."
3,Wait for the paperback edition,I rarely buy the hardcover edition of any book but I was familar with several of the contributing authors and I liked the subject matter so I bought the book while on vacation. There may be a FEW gems in the book but there are also a lot of so-so short stories and a few that I wouldn't even finish reading. This book won't be gathering dust on my book shelf. I'm donating it to my local library.
3,Almost a children's book,"It is true, as other reviewers have stated, that this anthology of mythology is not meant for adults. However, it doesn't seem strong enough for young adults either. Except for some of the themes, many of the stories seem more appropriate for younger children. The fact is, they are predictable and not terribly imaginative. A few are better written, with beautiful use of the language. Perhaps this is one of the difficulties with themed anthologies."
3,The Green Man,"My library didn't categorize this book as a young adult anthology, which it should have, because it's clearly intended for a YA audience.Perhaps because of the audience, much of the material was naive in tone and less than dramatic in plotline. There were good stories by Tanith Lee, Patricia McKillip, Carol Emshwiller, Gregory Maguire, Emma Bull and Kathe Koja, but nothing earthshaking. I was disappointed that none of the stories really seemed to have anything incisive to say about environmental themes; they tended toward retold fairy tales and coming of age stories.I wish that, in these folk/fairy tale-oriented anthologies, real scholars of folklore and mythology would be invited to write the introductions. It would be interesting to get an informed viewpoint on the themes as they have been expressed in real people's beliefs and practices."
5,Hong Kong (The Great Cities),"One of 25 books in ""The Great Cities"" series from time life, this title describes the history, development, culture, and daily life of Hong Kong and its residents.Elegant's writing is particularly descriptive and even at times poetic for a non-fiction title. He describes the turbulent history of the city, including the imperialistic origins, opium wars, and post World War II development. The food, cultural traditions and superstitions, geography, and business development are unveiled beautifully and practically for the reader.Although the book could be considered to be out of date to some (as it was published in the late 1970's), I particularly enjoyed seeing what the city was like in the 70's and how it has changed over the years. Those familiar with the city can enjoy the book in a nostalgic sense. The photographs are very engaging in that they focus on the everyday life of the city's residents, their culture and customs."
2,Ugly,"yes! the bag is pretty ugly... the thing is as wide as your back plus your arms... however, it did look functional.... i ended up returning it."
4,the package box was too big,"i had to pay for the extra volume of the outer box for this backpack, but on the other hand the backpack was exactly what i needed..."
3,not as good as the first two books,"I don't usually write reviews about books but this time I just had to. I enjoyed this series of books up until this one book. I was intrigued by the ghost/treasure story and wanted to see how it ended. However, I found the female character, Jackie, to be the worst character I have to read through. She was stupid, insecure and untrusting at every point in the story. The whole time I wanted to tell Adrian to dump her and get a woman with a spine. She was always running to bathroom after sex or after something nice was said to her. I found her to be so annoying that I almost couldn't finish the book. I actually skipped over the everything this character said the whole last half of the book just waiting to see if the ghosts were freed. Then we get that part and what a let down!I can't remember the last time I this disappointed in a book."
4,Good light reading,I liked all three of the books in this series. They are all good light reading and still manage to inject a bit of mystery into the romance arena.
4,"Fun, light summer read","The Pearl Island trilogy is a fun, light, summer read. It's a good, sexy, romance. A couple of lovelorn ghosts are part of the story line, but that part of it did not turn this trilogy into an other world fantasy. I read 5 of Julie's books this summer. My only complaint was that on the Kindle edition where you depend on the percent designation instead of page numbers, Julie's books end at about 85% with the rest of the pages being previews of other books. It really took me by surprise on the first book and I was very disappointed there wasn't more story."
5,Don't Temp Me,Great story with great characters in each of the three books. You won't be sorry and will want to read all three of the trilogy.
5,this stuff works!,I use this every day and it eases the warm feeling in my lower legs...I do not have veins that are raised...hoping to avoid this...use it at night also.
4,It's 4 separate espisodes,"It was fun, just had to listen to opening songs 4 times since it's 4 actual TV programs put together. some songs are replays of other DVDs, but overall entertaining. Not my favorite."
3,Good Cast in a Decent Low Budget Effort,"Former Tarzan (and former hubby of Lana Turner) Lex Barker portrays the fearless Indian scout in this tale of pre-Revolutionary Indian Wars in the area where Detroit now stands. Lon Chaney does well as a sympathetic Chief Pontiac who only choses the warpath when forced to it by the brutality of the White Man. Barry Kroeger is most hatefull as the Hessian Officer. Not bad, considering this one was probably made on a shoestring."
3,Battles of Chief Pontiac,"Interesting for a film this old to put the white men in the ""bad guys"" role. Not a great movie, and a bit slow moving, but okay. South Dakota's Black Hills look nice. The title is a bit odd, as there is only one battle in the movie and it's more of a skirmish."
5,We are Shark loving household,"This is an amazing novelty item! I needed something a little bigger to keep on the table to open my micro brews and I was sick of losing the little bottle opener we had to the monster on the coffee table. So I figured either switch to twisties or find one that I just couldn't lose. Bingo we have a winner! It is pretty good size and might be a little cheezy for some, but over all we rock it!"
2,shark bottle opener,"looks good but uncomfortable to hold - too big, and the side fins are pointed and dig into hand"
1,"Painful to use, and not even decorative","The fins are too sharp to hold comfortably while opening pull tabs or bottles, and the shark bottle opener is too large to even be cute."
2,This movie sucks.,"Alex Skarsgard was the only reason why I purchased this movie. I was dissapointed at the end. There is not central theme to this ridiculous movie. It is one giant disaster. Julie is cool, but does much better acting in Dexter."
5,Crazy film!,"Crazy film, when i started it I didnt know where it would take me. But this movie is a trip. I would recommend it."
1,Even Alex couldn't save it,"In the space between True Blood seasons we thought this might be a fun diversion, but it's not. This movie is hardly watchable. Alex in a dress is amusing, but not worth watching the whole of this disaster."
2,Cheap plastic,"Yes, my 4 year old son loves these, but they are not durable. They would be good for use at a party but not day after day which is what I bought them for. He asked for a SpongeBob cup and this is what I found..."
5,book,excellent book helped us in special set ups on our newly purchased moore jig bore grinder that we purchased this year
5,Highly recommended,"I enjoyed this movie a lot !!!. Very well filmed and it goes directly to the emotional part of the sport competition at different levels, from the elite runners to the simple amateur. Look at the eyes of the main characters and you'll figure out what exactly a marathon means. I've never been in Chicago and the movie shows nice pictures of the city. To the end of the marathon, a banner with something written made me laugh a lot : ""You're all crazy"". Perhaps we are."
4,Glad I watched it.,"I thought this movie was a little better than most of the ""running"" videos out there."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I saw this movie at the theatre. It was remarkably inspiring. I wanted to go out that night and run a marathon. The director does a beautiful job of weaving the stories of several runners who are training for the Chicago Marathon. He takes both elite runners and everyday middle of the pack runners. Many, many inspiring stories! I plan to own it and show it to my cross country kids. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL RUNNERS!!!"
5,I love it,"As a runner who runs alone...I really enjoyed watching this movie. To see how other runners prepare for runs and races. The different backgrounds and stories, yet the way running can bring people together."
3,Okay - Spirit of the Marathon DVD,"I bought this for my son who is a runner - it's Ok but not quite what we were expecting...more of a docuemntary, but broken up into different runners experiences and events...hard to watch all in one sitting."
3,For the first time marathoner,"I didn't find this movie motivational at all but it did contain a lot of information for someone interested in what it takes to train and complete a first marathon. If your already in a marathon training program or have already run a few marathons spend you money on a motivational movie.Bruce20+ marathons, 2 Chicagos, and 2:48 PR."
2,Marathon Video,"This video serves the person who wants extra attention and praise for running a marathon. It praises you and the people in the video as great acheivers- which they are. Yet, it offers no educational benefit on how to run a marathon."
3,ok - but not great,"I watched this movie a week before I ran my first marathon for 25 years. I can't say it was inspirational or particularly interesting. People training for a marathon, and some interviews. That's about it. Yes training can be hard, injuries can lead to disappointment, but running a marathon isn't such a big deal."
5,Excellent value,"I purchased the Farberware butterwarmer primarily to melt butter when making popcorn. It's terrific. Butter melts nicely, doesn't burn. I'm very happy with the construction of this nice little addition to any kitchen."
4,Butterwarmner,"I haven't used it yet to be honest, but it's made very, very well, like the silverstone pots and pans I received with it. It's actually pretty heavy for a little sauce pan. It's small and cute, and made very well. Hoping to use it around the next holiday..."
2,handle becomes hot .,"While removing from gas stove, be careful while taking out of stove. The Handle becomes hot fast. Rest other things are fine"
4,Super cute,"This was a surprise purchase that the kids love. Elmo has a bit of an Italian accent, and the pizza speaks as well. It's much cuter than the tickle me products out now. Great Christmas gift for under $10 when on sale. Very durable."
5,"Cute, Cute, Cute","I normally don't write reviews but I'll make an exception in this case. I gave Pizza Party Elmo as a Christmas Gift to my 4 year old cousin. The look on his face when he opened the package was nothing short of unforgettable. Elmo is one of his favorites anyway but dressed in a brightly colored apron, with his chef's hat on, and holding his favorite food was almost too much. His face lit up and he could hardly wait for his dad to get Elmo out of the packaging. But the best part was the singing pizza. By this time the adults were hooked also. This toy is well worth the $. Cute, Cute, Cute!"
4,My Child Loves this Battery Hog,"I have a 1 year old boy. He loves this toy. He dances when it sings and touched the pizza's mouth when it talks. My child does not like riding in the car, but if we bring this toy it calms him down and he does fine. But, IT SUCKS DOWN BATTERIES LIKE NOBODIES BUSINESS. It has a battery compartment in both feet. If it stops sing part of the way through, It needs the batteries replaced."
2,The most annoying toy ever invented,My child seems to love it. I think it's part of the Fifth Circle of Hell. I cannot wait for the batteries to die. This requires no imagination from children and gives them very little incentive to actually play with it. I don't think toys should have to be watched.
4,Elmo is hilarious!,"We bought this because it looked funny, and weren't disappointed! Although my eight-year-old is too old for Elmo, she cracks up just as much as I do when this plays! The singing/joke-telling pizza is just the right ""topping"" for this toy. I recommend buying!"
4,GREAT TOY 2 YEAR OLD LOVES IT,bought for (2) 2 year olds and it was the hit present. I thought it was a little silly but that is what little kids like.would buy again in a minuteI got a GREAT price on it - one that could not be beat
4,"cute, annoying after a while!",My son will sit and watch Elmo and pizza sing for hours. He'll push the button over and over and over and well you get the point! He really likes it!
3,our elmo sings half a song after one week,"My two year old anticipated this toy for weeks. We'd listen to video singing everyday online. Well, it was a great gift for a week or so. Now, Elmo plays only half a song. I'm sure he was dropped a few times but should last longer than that. Not going to bother sending back as defective since shipping would cost too much. It is cute though and it sang clearly originally."
4,Get Ready to Sing the Pizza Song!,"I bought this for my 3-year-old nephew and he liked it quite a bit, but my 5-year-old son was even more mezmerized by it. The singing pizza is pretty adorable! Beware that the tune to this little guy really sticks... it won't be long before you find yourself humming the Pizza Song incessantly. ""Yummy, yummy, it's a pizza pie...."""
4,Every kid love Elmo and this one is toy no different,As soon as we pinch his hand my daughter's smile is her largest!! She finds the pizza pie funny that it talks. She is 15 months old and it lights up her life.
3,defective,most of the time it doesn't play the full song. It plays half the song and then shuts off. once in a while it plays the full song. My son loves it anyway.
3,Elmo needs lots of batteries!,"This was a great toy for our little Sesame Street fan, but in about 1/2 day, the batteries die! No matter what kind I use, it still eats them up and then only half of the song will play until you change them again. I end up putting it away for a few weeks here and there so he can play with it for one day. Bummer."
5,My daughter sings this all day long! AWESOME TOY!,"Adding this toy to my daughter's collection was a must, she is 23months old and has always been a huge fan of Elmo. It is a bit loud,but then again so are kids!! Let the kids have fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Cute enough,"I love that the pizza sings along and the toy is adorable, but that's about it. It doesn't have too much more going on for it. It sings and swings the pizza around. Overall it's a nice enough toy but it isn't really exciting. But for the price of 7.50 I couldn't pass it up."
3,Nice headache toy,My son really enjoy this toy and plays the song over and over. My son never gets tired of the song but there are others in the household that it drives us crazy.
3,"cute, cute, cute","My daughter just opened a pickup/delivery pizza place. She has Elmostanding on the front counter for all to enjoy. He us just so cuteand sings great too. So does the pizza!She didn't want to destroy all of the surroundingsthat came with the box so she just cut off the top of the box and he isnow displayed with the pizza boxes that came with him, and back of the box scenery. However, For anyone getting this for their child, I think they will be taking the batteries out after a couple of days. I think it's a great novelty."
3,"Cute, but annoying!","I got this for my 2 year old. He loved watching the little video online, so I figured he like the real one as well. He's played with it a couple times and likes to dance to the song, but gets tired of it quickly. I think the song should be a little shorter.I don't like the fact that there's no volume control on it. It's so loud! It's also pointless for this to come with the cardboard pizza boxes. They all have holes in them from where they were tied into the box, so they're not even worth playing with (if they're even supposed to be).It's pretty cute the first 50 times, but my husband wanted to throw the thing out the window after a while!"
2,Entertaining for all of 10 minutes...,"While it is an amusing toy, it doesn't really stand to ever be a child's favorite.It only sings one song, and the pizza tells one joke. There's nothing else it does - no variation whatsoever.It also has no volume control, and is dangerously, not to mention obnoxiously LOUD. The speaker is internal, so you can't muffle it either.While we've only had it for a matter of hours, I worry about the stability of it as well. With a child, the pizza could easily break and cease to function, ruining the whole element of the song.So, it's cute... play with it in the store, or at a friend's house, but don't buy it."
3,Fun but does not hold up,"I bought the toy as a Christmas gift foy son. It was fun and enjoyable, for the first couple of days. By day four, it had already stopped working. The arm would only move about half way and the song got hung up after the first verse. Not real impressed with how well it help up."
1,Already broken,"We received this as a gift for my daughter for her 1st birthday. The toy is already broken. Since we didn't get a gift receipt and threw the box away, it's useless. It was fun and cute until it stopped singing."
2,Inferno Affairs is a lot a lot better!!,"Let me say this, as some may suspect. It's a poor man attempt to catch on the success of the two guys duel drama - Inferno Affairs. It's rather obvious after I watched the first 30 min.After the interesting beginning bits, the movie fails miserably, because the plot is rather weak, since the film is really designed to display the drama between two male-actors, such like Inferno Affairs (or Running out of time), however Leon, as an actor, has never been in the same level as Tony Leung, Andy Lau and Lau Ching-Wan, although I think Erik has performed slightly above his average, but it is clearly not enough. It becomes boring somewhere in the middle, and got worse.Another thing is how the film described Hypnotism is bogus. It may as well say that Leon's character is a magician, which would be more realistic."
2,No so good,"I found the noodles to be bland. There was just a little sweetness, and no peanut flavor at all. Even the peanuts themselves were tasteless orange pellets. I couldn't even finish it."
3,A decent instant noodle,"This product beats raman noodles in taste and comes in it's own preparation container. The color of the spice is sort of an unappetizing orange when you first open it, but it tastes good enough. There is no noticeable spiciness to this dish. However, if you take this to work you should be aware that after microwaving for 2 minutes you have to wait 6-7 for the noodles to cook. Also, besides the peanut pieces there are not other vegetables or anything, it's just flavored noodle."
2,Libertarian young-adult monster thriller? If you say so...,"This is an odd mix of libertarian government-bashing, monster thriller, and young adult concerns, and nothing quite fits together. Drawing on the ""rogues' gallery"" of monsters from the Godzilla films, Cerasini spins a tale of an ancient Antarctic civilization (with a hat-tip to H. P. Lovecraft) out to clear the world of humans. A publicity tour of genius teens (in their own blimp!) and soldiers is the world's only hope to stop the monsters, and, by the way, Godzilla follows them for no apparent reason. If you like Godzilla monsters or military hardware, you'll find something for you. Otherwise, skip it."
1,Godawful,"I am a MAJOR Godzilla fan, so ofcourse when i saw this book ibought it. Ha! Marc Cerasini claims to be a big Godzilla fan, yet he is ruining the whole series with his horrible novels. First MAJOR mistake is his is mixing the Monster series with the Hensi series. Are we to believe that Megalon, the goofiest of the monster (not including Gabbera cause he was make believe in a childs dream) is in the same story as Biollante and Battra? I mean your mixing serious Godzilla with the goofy 70's Godzilla. If you were to take Biollante and Battra out mabey, MABEY this book might actully be worthy of having the title of Godzilla on the cover. Infact the cover is the only highlight of the book. I dont like how the new wave of Godzilla books are totaly destroying the Godzilla Series its self. I own ALOT of imported godzilla toys and posters, but ill never buy these American books agian. Shame on you Marc Cerasini. Dont buy this book if your a serious hardcore Godzilla Fan!"
4,Godzilla returns to save the world and this book (almost).,"This sequel picks up after Godzilla 2000 ends (appropiately enough). There are plenty of in-joke references to Emmerich and Devlin's Independence Day and their own Godzilla film's add compaign. There are also references to other classic SF flicks, notably John Carpenter's superlative version of The Thing, and H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulthu Mythos stories. Sadly the humans eclipse some of the monster action, so this feels kind of slow mving. Kaiju classic creatures Megalon and Hedorah (aka The Smog Monster) feel tacked on rather than integral parts of the main plot. But the ending is nothing short of incredible and leaves the reader wanting more. If only the monsters had been better handled, this would have garnered five stars. Recommended."
4,"Swift, entertaining reading","This is a well-written book that moves along quickly and has an interesting, bright heroine. My only complaint is that it is billed as a gothic romance and isn't as spooky or suspenseful as the gothics I am used to. However, there is PLENTY of heart-stopping romance here though (which is often an afterthought in some gothics) so it sort of balances itself out. Jo-Ann Power is an author I will be very happy to read again!"
5,"Terrific training tool, but identical to Good Dog, Bad Dog","This book is packed with really wonderful training information (my excitable, lunging puppy has nearly mastered heel in 3 lessons) but don't buy it if you already own Good Dog, Bad Dog -- it contains EXACTLY the same training information, much to my chagrin! (I ended up returning this to Amazon for a refund.) I was looking forward to another Uncle Matty book. It would have been more useful if it had included some new takes on problem behavior -- jumping, mouthing, etc. But if you don't already own Good Dog, Bad Dog, it's a wonderful training tool."
5,Jerk and Shout? Quite the opposite,"The first reviewer obviously has not read this book - or at the least completely failed to understand it. I've been to two different obedience training classes with my dog and neither was nearly as helpful as Uncle Matty. I've recommended this book to several friends and all agree that it's the best dog training book ever. Uncle Matty knows dogs and he'll train you to understand them, as well."
2,Writen for an idiot child,"""Repeat after me, please, I am Jeanette.""""Okay. I am Jeanette.""""I am a human.""She sighs.""I am a human.""""Punch is a dog.""""Okay, okay.""""Come on, say it""Page 44This is all you need to know about this book. It treats you like an idiot, incapable of recognizing that you know full well you are not a dog and that dogs think differently. I would appreciate being treated like the college educated adult that I am. The anecdotes are poorly written and take away from the task at hand. At least now I know why this book was $3 at the used book store."
1,The Same Old Yell at Your Dog and Jerk the Leash Stuff,"I didn't buy this book, a friend lent it to me to read. Thank goodness I didn't spend money because I would be even more annoyed than I am. The book basically uses the same 'solution' for every problem. Jerk the leash and yell no! First, I don't need a book to tell me how to do that and second I am really into dogs and have read other books that come up with much better solutions that don't require screaming at the dog and jerking it around on a choke collar. What is with these guys?"
2,Good info; bad presentation.,"I am glad this book was purchased at a discount because it is so painful to read. The information is good, but it is presented in such a way as to drive off any thinking person. The book is written as a set of dialogs between ""Uncle Matty"" Margolis and his irritatingly stupid students. If these are real people, it is scary to think that they might be allowed to vote and drive cars. I found myself focusing on this aspect more than listening to what Mr. Margolis had to say in each lesson, which when one takes out the dialog, are actually pretty helpful. I suppose the problem is that once you've written one dog training book, there's not much else you can say on the subject. However, ""Uncle Matty"" needs to keep writing books (it's a living), and this is the result."
1,The Ultimate Guide to Dog Training,The writing style was nauseating and it certainly isn't the ultimate guide to dog training.Not worth buying
3,Multiply,"I truly think that ""Multiply"" is the single of the year. The rest of the album hasn't hit me yet. ""Multiply"" however is one of those perfectly executed pop songs that will stay in your mind forever. The song, the voice and the production are all spot on."
2,Mediocre CD,"The recording quality sounds a bit amateurish, for example, the bass is very weak compared to the high and mid-range tones. The singing is average and the songs are not memorable except for the ""A little bit more."" All in all, you pay for that single song."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,"Was more than a bit disappointed with this record. I rarely buy a disc based on one song, but when I read some of the other reviews that raved about it I thought, ""I've got an open mind, let's give it a go."" I only ended up liking 2-3 songs on the whole thing. Perhaps this is one of those that will grow on me. But it hasn't yet."
3,it was aw'ite,"i brought this cd because of the Target commercial, but the rest of the tracks are sub standard.."
3,Could do with some colour,"For such a large size book it is very disappointing that there are so few colour images and such as are printed are not on the scale of size that would let the reader revel in the finer detail of Van Dyck's work. It is understandable that the catalogue section of the book was Black & White for reasons of economy, but the preceding pages could have benefited from colour close-ups and full page plates. The book may be useful for a scholar, but it will remain to other books to exemplify the genius of Van Dyck. There is a more affordable and enjoyable option in Christopher Brown's book ""Anthony Van Dyck"" published by Rizzoli in 1999."
2,Lack of color detroys what should have been a masterpiece,"Van Dyck is one of my favorite painters and I was looking forward to this updated catalogue raisonne as the previous one published in the mid 80's had a a mere 100 paintings reproduced in color.I was prepared to spend a large sum of money so I could have access to most of his paintings reproduced in color.This book had the potential to be one of tha great art books.It is beautifully laid out into four different periods and the color reproductions are of a high standard and the majority are a good size.The major problem with the book is that a paltry 190 out of 900 paintings are reproduced in color.In this era,a catalogue raisonne should have the majority of works in color(take a look at the Velazquez,Soutine,Rothko,Newman and O'Keeffe),B/W reproductions aren't worth a glance.I'm now having second thoughts about buying this even at Amazon's reduced price($135).A major disappointment."
4,Its all opinions,"Just about every bad review that i read for this movie had people saying crap like ""Maybe everyone was on some drugs while seeing this, thats why it was so funny to them"" or ""What were they smoking"". Just because they didnt find it funny must mean everyone else who liked it was high, the world needs a LOT less people like these high and mighty jerks. Oh yea, the movie was ok, rent before you buy."
5,WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a CLASSIC. IT is so funny, and is the most oringinal movie I've ever seen. Maybe all of you forty year olds don't like this movie because 'it doesn't have a plot' GET OVER IT! That's why it's sooo funny and original. You have to see it if you already haven't! There aree hilarious quotes and scenes."
3,So-so,"This movie definitely had some funny moments, but at the end of the movie I was left thinking, ""So What?"". The majority of the movie is just so random and strange. Those were 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. However, I do admit that the scene towards the end of the movie where Napoleon does that dance on stage is hilarious. He reminds me way too much of Poindexter from ""Revenge of the Nerds""."
4,Strange,"This has to be one of the strangest movies I have ever seen! The movie's plot is kind of ""zig-zag,"" but I WAS able to empathize with the lead character, who has trouble fitting into a world not accepting of individual differences. One is re-aquainted with how judgemental and cruel high school can be especially for someone who is ""different.""I was pleased that my son, who is in the late elementary grades, enjoyed this film. I hope he learned something about the importance of tolerance and the value of a friend."
3,What Just Happened?,"I laughed myself silly for 90 minutes in this movie, which is by far the most absurd thing I've ever seen. There's no plot, there's little direction, and there's little actual story taking place. Despite those things, this movie was one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies I've seen in a while. I think it's great because it's a comedy out of the sheer lunacy of every character in the movie, not because of ridiculous gags that American cinema has overused to death lately.I recommend this movie for everyone, especially if you're drunk. Really really really drunk. When I buy this movie, I'm going to get drunk and laugh for hours!!"
5,NAPOLIAN ROCKS!!!,I went and saw this movie at the theater. I didnt think that it would be funny but it was the funniest movie i have ever seen in my life. it is one of the select movies that are rated pg and can still be great. napolian is my favorite movie and i encourage everyone to go out and watch it.
3,GO HOME RICO GO HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Wow this movie didn't really do a lot for me but Uncle Rico and Kip had me laughing. Napoleon and his crew just weren't funny.
5,Idahoan Humor at it's finest,"As I read the reviews of this film it strikes me as odd...Most of those reviewing the movie and claiming that none of it's characters would actually exist in real life, have two things against them...First of all not one of these people reviewing the film from this angle are in Idaho....I lived in Idaho for 6 years and want to say definitavelty that these kinds of people not only do exist in real life but exist in Idaho...Secondly if someone made a film full of a cast that ""would or could actually exist in real life"" it would possibly be the single most boring movie of all time...This is why reality TV is so popular it is really not reality but what we ""wish"" reality was.This is the second greates film of all time! The only movie that even falls into the same catagory is PeeWee's Big Adventure."
2,Dragged Out,"While I was watching the movie I remember praying for the time when the movie would end. It was so slow and boring, but I kept thinking maybe it would get better. Besides I wanted to see what all the hype was about. I really didn't like this movie and I regret buying it.... but the movie is a great converstion started. It sounds funny afterwards when you're talking to your friends about it, but otherwise, not at all."
4,"Review of UMD, not the movie.","Well, I think plenty have said what they think of the movie here and I'll just skip that part. Obviously, if you like ND, you'll like the UMD.Three things you should know about the UMD version of ND are:1. All it has for bonus features is some trailers. Boo.2. The new ketchup-packet menu animations are REALLY cool.3. Audio sounds fine, but the video suffers from a common UMD problem I've noticed: wash-out. Blacks aren't black enough and the movie feels a little too ""grey"" as a result.Far from unwatchable, a good-enough version of ND on UMD."
4,Napoleon,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" seems to be a movie that you either love, or love to hate. I'll admit, the first time I saw this movie, I didn't get it. Then I realized that there really wasn't much to get, which is what makes the movie so great. There's really isn't much of a plotline, but the hilarity of the characters makes up for it. From the set and costume design to the characters themselves, the movie is just plain funny. Another thing that makes this movie worthwhile is that it's capable of holding different meanings for different people. Some see it as purely comedic fun, others see it as a sort of coming of age story, and some people just don't see anything in it at all. However you feel about this film, you have to admit it's definitely one of a kind."
5,Napoleon Dynamite,I purchased this movie for my son for Christmas and he just loves it.It is a very funny movie. Good clean comedy. Kind of corny but really a good movie. I would recommend it for everyone.
5,It grows on you,"I am a high school teacher, that being said, I decided on the last day ofschool that as a treat we would watch a movie. I borrowed Napoleon Dynamite from my brothers vast DVD collection. I had no idea what the movie was about but my students told me it was funny. I looked it up on IMDB to see its rating. It is PG because of the word ""piss"" and a man selling breast enlargement pills. Pretty tame stuff in this day and age.I watched it three times in one day. The first viewing I was confused...it did not seem that funny. The second and third time I watched it I just laughed and laughed through out the whole movie.It grows on you, and you will find yourself laughing about lines from the movie at odd times through out your life.I do recommend this movie. It is just SWEET, in every sense of the word."
1,THE DYNAMITE JUST EXPLODED.,ARE YOU KIDDING ME. Anyone likes this movie is someone with no life. The humor is low I storngly DO NOT recamend this movie.
1,OUTRAGED!,"If I could give this movie 0 stars I would. This movie was the most boring, rascist movie ever. They categorize mexicans as inferior, short, ignorant,dark skinned(like it's a bad thing), cholo type people, with accents and they are not all like that. I was outraged! Not all mexicans are boot-wearing ""vaquero"" , mustached looking FREAKS! This is the most low quality film! No wonder MTV made it! This is MTV's attemp on a good comedy film was worthless.Trust me it's absolutely not funny your just wasting your time watching this as I have wasted mine If you want a funny film watch a Jackie Chan film.DO NOT WATCH IT!The rasicim was not just on mexicans It was on all kinds of people fat, white...And some people are saying that the music is good Backstreet boys, larger than life,HA those days are over."
5,Brilliant one-liners,"I watched this 3 times in a row and 5 times so far and still get plenty of laughs. Napoleon Dynamite represents the coming-of-age nerd that we all knew (or were). I almost forgot how messed up high school life was with the prima donnas, bullies, idiot relatives and socially awkward people. Years later, I still laugh at Napoleon's weakling brother (""watch it Napoleon, I'm a trained cage fighter"") and the martial arts instructor (""I'm Rex, founder of the Rex Kwan Do self-defense system! After one week with me in my dojo, you'll be prepared to defend yourself with the STRENGTH of a grizzly, the reflexes of a PUMA, and the wisdom of a man."")Doug Setter, Bsc.Author ofOne Less Victim: A Prevention GuideandStomach Flattening"
4,"Well, I thought it was funny","First time I saw this movie it was probably already in the middle somewhere. My first impression was that it was wierd and possibly stupid. A friend of mine at work was raving about it so when it popped up on cable again I sat all the way through it. Seemed wierd again but pretty funny. The third time was the charm. I sat through it again, this time looking forward to certain parts. Bottom line: this is a weird and very funny movie. Some people just aren't going to get it. If it's any help seeing where I'm coming from, I've probably watched ""Groundhog Day"" about 10 times. There's even some irony in that, don't you think? If you thought ""Hee Haw"" was funny, maybe this isn't your movie."
1,Not even close to good,"Cheesy Casio soundtrack + zero charisma characters + zero plot + nothing genuinely funny... Not enjoyable in the least. This movie is nowhere near the billiance of Raising Arizona or Rushmore as other reviewers might lead you to believe. It is poorly written, with very limited dialog. I can only assume that the only reason this movie has gained any attention is due to MTV putting their logo on it. If ""MTV Approved"" means quality to you, then by all means gobble up this turd.This movie should have been a ""learning experience"" for its creators, letting them move on to better projects before really getting any exposure."
2,Napoleon Dynamite - 104-4154936-8176764,"This indie favorite follows Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a quirky, ninja-loving teenager growing up in the far reaches of Idaho. Napoleon's life gets complicated when his shady Uncle Rico (John Gries) shows up, a shy girl (Tina Majorino) starts showing him some attention and his best friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) decides to run for school president. Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2004."
1,Worse Movie Ever!,If you are thinking about watching/buying this movie DON'T! I actually bought it because a friend said it was funny. It is truly one of the worse movies I have EVER seen.
1,Dumbest movie in years.,"Is this supposed to be art? Because it has no other value, other than perhaps for the purpose of studying the effects of boredom on the human psyche. I kept expecting the main character to be a hero, instead he's just a loser. I can appreciate a movie without a hero (i.e. Being John Malkovich) but can't they at least make the loser character someone who does something...anything...interesting?Also, the other characters are really weak. The best potential characters, the grandma for example, are barely ever on screen.I thought this movie would be like Rushmore, and I couldn't have been more wrong.I will say one thing positive about it, though, there is a scene where Napolean goes to jump his bike on a ramp and instead just plows through it - a really funny gag, I have to admit...most of us have done something like that.In summary, might be worth it if you can rent it cheap and get a backup movie, but I wouldn't recommend buying it."
1,Pseudo-Intellectualism at it's height,"People like this movie for the same reason that they like Donnie Darko, because they feel like they should. If you've seen a movie like American Beauty, Adaptation, Rushmore, or The Royal Tennenbaums, you can see an example of a somewhat true change of characters, and not a half-baked people for people who want to dig existentialism or the like. I feel like i'm hitting this movie as harder than I should, but I don't like people raving about this movie when i've seen a lot like it a lot better done way before it."
1,really bad,"I don't know what all you people see in this movie. There's really no plot, just about some nerd. It's not about anything. The way he speaks gets really annoying after a while. The only reason I got through the whole thing was because I was seeing it with someone and didn't wanna be rude by turning it off. She didn't like it either..."
1,Stupest movie ever made,"This is the the absolute worst movie ever created. I watched it 3 times....and everytime I have to stop watching because id rather slit my throat than watch this garbage. Its the most boring, dumb, red-neck hick movie ever created."
2,Very disappointing,"Boring. The only time I chuckled was Kip's reaction when he backed over the tupperware. However, I can understand how a 13 year old boy would find this movie entertaining.Since there is a whole class of movies that are worse than this, so I'll give it 2 stars, not one."
3,This movie was pretty good,"I got a few laughs out of it, but I don't know what all the fuss was about. It was a little slow too me but overall better than most big budget flicks."
2,What is going on here?,"The other night I was at a friend's house. We were bored, so we decided to rent a movie. At the movie store, we spotted Napoleon Dynamite, the movie that people were calling 'Hilarious'......We rented it and went back to my friend's house to watch it.This was by FAR the worst movie I have ever seen. What is it that people see in this movie?I'm not going to tell people not to see it. Why? Because my friend was laughing his heart out.....and it's usually very tough to make that particular friend of mine laugh. So I suggest you see it. No matter if it's funny or stupid to you, it will stick in your memory for a long, long time."
2,1.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Perhaps the dumbest movie to receive mainstream appreciation, Napoleon Dynamite not only features not plot but no humor--the audience is instead expected to laugh at constant repitions of the word ""gosh"" and Napoleon's uncle eating lots of steak...how funny."
1,In a word... POOR !!!!,"You have been warned, I now wish I was. This movie quite simply sucks and I'm amazed that it even stuck to film that was used to record this rag. Why did they waste good laser power to create this garbage on DVD? Watch at your OWN risk!!!"
1,seriously,"defending this movie is as bad as defending george lucas' new star wars movies. It should never have been made. its crap. no offense to those who liked it. As a film.... its bad. as a story... its bad.watch it again from the point of view that there is something wrong with the portrayal of events taking place. Especially when compared to the world we live in, where every apathetic american could care less about starving children in africa. If we had napolean dynomites everywhere, which we probably do, then nothing will get done. No redeeming qualities about the characters or the movie.for once i agree with roger ebert"
1,Napoleon Dynamite,Probably one of the most retarded movies i have ever seen...It's about as funny as a legless ethiopian watching a donut roll down a hill.I would not recommend this movie to anyone!
4,Napoleon Dynamite,This movie is great I love it. I was laughing for at least twenty minuets after I finished watching it. A great all around family movie.
1,Whats so funny?,"MEET THE FOCKERS is 100 x better than this boring garbage of a movie...It has two funny parts...When he gets slammed against the locker and that little kick he does, and then when they two guys are riding their bikes. THATS IT!"
2,Huh?,"I'm a moron so I didn't get this film. I need humor to be so obvious, it hits me smack in the face before I understand that its supposed to be funny and that I'm supposed to laugh. Give me Martin Lawrence - BOOOO YAH! any day. Give me American Pie. Give me people doing crude, disgusting things like having sex with pastries, or lots of sex & body function humor. Then my cretin mind gets it. ha ha."
3,Napoleon you're jealous cause I've been chating with babes..,This movie was kinda funny but it was also stupid. Napolean is ugly but he's is fun to watch. Pedro is weird and so is Napoleons brother. why do they always talk side to side and not look at each other. Napoleon's always got his eyes closed.
1,Wrost Mtv Film Of All Time !,"I thought Joe's Apartment was bad but this wow !It sucked,Why would anyone spend money on this?If anyone like this movie you need help seriously"
1,What....?,"What was even going on in this movie? I'm all for the underdog story, but this is one that should've stayed down. Don't rent, don't buy. Waste of money."
1,Waste of time,You will never get the time you waste on this piece of trash back. Do yourself a favor and skip it. I didn't spend any money on this movie and I still feel like I was robbed.
1,this movie is crappy!!!!!(...),"This movie sucks. do not waste your money on it. It is so b(...)ooring. There is only 2 funny parts. One of them isn,t even funny, it is retarded. This movie has basiclly no plot. It is also really dull. It has all talk and no action. If you are a nerd, you will love this movie. If you are a normal cool person you will barf at the stupidity of the movie.I would give this movie -9000(...)0 stars if I could. Dont buy or rent this movies. Instead buy Blankman and charish it."
2,Garbage,"This is possibly the worst made in film in America TODAY!!!!Do NOT Buy this, it has some highspots but overall it's Garbage!"
1,A child's insight on a horrible movie.,"Eh, bleh, ul, and uck are what I use to describe this movie. After just watching it, I am incabable of proper Engligh, and this movie isn't deserving of it anyway. Slow paced (after watching it for half an hour I thought it was over, and had to turn it off when I found out it still had an hour left) it has no humor whatsoever, and stained my brain for the rest of the day.It is a very popular movie in my school, and so stupid there is no reason whatsoever to see it. My vocabulary is to limited to describe it in the way I want to. Everyone in my family despised it, and agree it is hideous, repulsive, moronic, and stupid.If you enjoy this movie, you are Napoleon Dynamite."
1,"""No Comment""","That is what I say to people who ask me what I thought of this movie. There were a few parts here and there..(maybe like 3) that made me at least smile (I'll give it 1 star for that), but they were few and far, far in between. I hate to say it but reading these reviews has made me laugh alot more than the movie did.Also a bit of a downer for me was Napoleon's attitude. I didn't think the bit in the beginning in the back of the bus was funny. I thought it just made him look like a jerk.Oh and I'm not a kid, really. I just didn't feel like signing up just to leave a comment. I'm 22 and love off the wall movies, but eh....*shrug*"
1,roar.,"This movie stunk. it was oh-so boring. what a waste of $20, I didn't laugh even once during this movie. It looked like it took a day to film. I could tell you the plot, but there isn't any. Please save your money and go see something that Adam sandler is in, who is actually funny."
1,definitely not explosive...,"1 star beeing the minimum this is what it gets, I can't remember having seen anything so stupid, this movie can at best get you smile or laugh out of despair, that's it.Not advisable for people with IQ over the room temperature."
1,Napoleon Dynamite - An utter waste of my precious time!,"A totally uninteresting, plotless, pointless and insipid waste of recording material. I gave it one star because it is not possible on this web page to give it less.When I take the time to watch a movie, I want to be entertained. That is why I pay my hard earned money to see a movie. I don't care if Roger Ebert likes it or not, his opinion is immaterial to me. I didn't like it.Napoleon Dynamite basically is a movie which shows a small section of the uninteresting life of an uninteresting high school pupil who has an equally uninteresing family. Who makes ""friends"" with a couple of equally boring and uninteresting people, and there it ends."
1,My Personal Experience with an Awful Movie,"I first heard about this movie last week, through the grapevine that is Jr. High. Everyone was raving about it, saying how funny and great it was. I just had to watch it too.So I rented the dvd. I watched the first half hour or so, waiting for the funny, a plot, anything to sustain me through the movie. Nothing. It's just the beginning, I thought. It'll be great by the end, just like everyone else said.So I waited. And waited. And waited. I waited until, finally, it was the end of the movie.I sat in amazement, wondering how anyone could like this movie. The 'laugh lines' that everyone raved about weren't funny. NO plot was ever really developed, and the movie never really finished.All in all, I would definitely say that this is the WORST movie I have ever seen, and that includes Glitter and the Spice Girls movie. I would not give this movie any stars if I was not required to."
2,If-y,goods: the downer charactersbads: story plot?Loser deadpan does not work for that long.overall: if-fy
1,i will never understand it....,"This movie was a large steaming turd. I am one who has always been intrigued by any type of movie..not being able to take my eyes away from it (especially if i paid money for it). But while watching Napoleon, I couldn't barely stay awake. All of you fans out there, stop and REALLY think about this movie...what is there to laugh at?...truly? Oh I know what it is! ""This film is artsy/cool and if I laugh at it then I WILL BE ARSTY/COOL!!! AND EVERYONE IN RETURN WILL THINK THAT I AM AWESOME!!"" People keep telling me ""Oh well some people just don't understand it and the others completely 'get it'"". News flash: There is nothing to get. And if I am a part of the group that 'doesn't get it' then God bless us all because we actually have a brain. Jesus. Please go rent a genuine comedy and prevent yourselves from torture."
1,This film is bad taste at it's best. Rent don't buy.,"There are two camps.Some find it funny, some find it stupid.If you like stupid films then this is for you.This film is bad taste at it's best.Do yourself a favour, rent it and watch it before you buy it, you will thank me."
1,Quite Possibly The Worst Movie Ever Made,"This movie has got to be the biggest turd ive ever had to watch. Its worse than the Envy, and thats really bad. I understand that alot of people find this movie funny (I mean ALOT), but I myself cannot find it in the least bit funny. When I heard that Nacho Libre was being made by the same guy I was skeptical, but, thanks to Jack Black, that movie turned out to be very funny and done in good taste. This movie, on the other hand, is unfunny as possible, the acting is atrocious and poor John Header will never be able to live this role down. Im sorry my friend, but doing this movie was the worst career move ever."
1,sucks - weak and pointless,weak and pointless says it all! Only rented for a Trivia event. what a waste of time. could never recommend it.
1,No Digital Copy Code,"No Digital Copy Code provided. Bought this for the ability to load on my iPad, but now just have the DVD."
3,Slow start to an odd film,"I would equate watching Napoleon Dynamite to watching a train wreck. It is like something bad that you can't turn away from. Now don't think I did not like the movie, I did, but I do not see why so many people put 5 stars for the film. It reminded me of an early style Wes Anderson style of film (which I do love) but missed the mark by just a bit. The slow build up to nothing might throw a few people off, but the film is well worth watching to the end at least once. I have not plans to purchase this title, but I would watch it again if a friend had it."
2,"Please, someone explain Napoleon Dynamite's appeal to me.","I'm serious. I feel left out. Just about everyone I know loves this movie, can quote lines from memory, wears a ""Vote for Pedro"" t-shirt, etc. I saw Napoleon Dynamite with five friends on DVD -- they laughed themselves sick, I sat there dumbfounded wondering what all the hype was about. I didn't hate it. I wasn't offended by it. The dance routine at the end was pretty funny. I just don't understand why it became such a big cult hit. Really, I want to join the party. If anyone can enlighten me on just what I'm missing when I watch Napoleon Dynamite, I'm more than willing to listen. Please feel free to contact me."
4,More Than Meets the Eye,"At first I wondered where this flick was going. But if you sit through this and focus, there is a point. The main character, Napoleon does seem like a totally socially inept nerd. But somewhere deep inside this kid has a SOUL He longs to connect. He's not a bad person. He's trying to rise above the swamp that his life is, and to some small extent, succeeds. His romantic interest, Deb, seems a little inept herself, but she has a degree of quiet charm about her, and she is trying to make a life for herself. All the main characters are struggling for a little bit of happiness, and to some extent succeed, even Grandma who has a boyfriend and rides ATV's.The ending is a vaguely happy one, and if these losers can grab a little joy in life, well hell, so can the rest of us.And don't forget to keep watching after the final credits, as there is about 5 more minutes of movie left."
5,Dyn-O-mite!!!,"Funny how varied the reviews can be for this movie! From one end of the spectrum to the other.I don't have a fancy degree in movies but I liked it :-) The humor is in the details, the pacing of the scenes, the warpedness, and in the slowness. The subtle ways Napolean or one of his friends says or does something, anything.There is no plot. But there is a plot, just noone tells you what that plot is. It's a few months in the life of Napolean and his wierd family.And MAN Napolean can DANCE!"
1,A Zero Rating Not Possible,"If a zero rating were possible, I would give this pathetic film that rating. It is beyond boring; it is beyond depressing; it is beyond bad acting and the most unlikeable characters ever created in fiction. There is nothing to like about this film....if you can stay awake... oh yes, I can see this film as a great sleep drug. The only film I hated as much as this one was Rushmore. I am a person who loves independent films and IFC is virtually the only channel I watch on TV, so I am not looking for Hollywood crap. In summary this film has nothing going for it and I cannot imagine anyone liking it for any reason."
1,absolutely terrible,"This is quite easily one of the worst films of which I have ever had the misfortune to allow myself to be subjected. The film is not funny, mostly boring, and a complete waste of time. It is a Wes Anderson film wannabe, without the wit, without the humor, and without talented actors to pull it off. Do not listen to those who insist upon this film being something special; simply put, this film has no reason to exist. See Rushmore which is infinitely better than this film."
2,don't torture yourself,"this has to be one of the most quoted movies ever, everyone from my boyfriend to my niece was quoting this movie. However it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was forced to sit through this at a firend's house. I wouldn't recomend this movie. Don't see it, if you don't have to. There are so many better movies out there."
2,Did I miss something?,"There was alot of hype surrounding this boring movie. All it was were some dorky kids that got singled out in school. It wasn't funny, and we took the movie out less than half way through."
5,Plus another Million stars!,"Why must everyone overanalyze this movie?? For starters, does everything have to make sense to be funny?? Heck no. I laughed the second Napoleon came on the screen and kept laughing til the end. The hilarious things in this movie are more about stupid humor, which is fine by me. The problem with many of today's movies is that they think they need to have sex jokes and cuss words to be funny. This movie shows that you can be funny just being stupid. I am 20 years old and I am immature. I laughed at this movie until I cried. This movie is the best movie I have ever seen.Aside from the side splitting laughter, this movie also has it's tender moments. You will probably cry when you see Trisha leave Napoleon at the dance...I did. And when Deb and Napoleon dance together, it just looks right.I could go on and on, but go see the movie. If you're a fan of crazy, stupid, humor........BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!"
3,"I liked it, but I am not sure why","Interesting, deadpan comedy. Not a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, but interesting quirky characters keept me interested. I enjoyed it, but don't get the hype around it. A decent rental."
4,"Heck, yes!!!","The first time I watched this movie, I laughed so hard I almost thought I was going to wet my pants, but I also thought it was incredibly dumb. There's just something about it, though, that just draws you to it over and over again. Each time I watch it, I like it more and more. I think this has to do with getting the little jokes that you missed all the times before that. Plus it has some of the best quotes in the world. Would I watch this movie again? Heck, yes!!"
5,Great but quirky movie,"I have to say I loved this movie. I have to give a word of caution though...it may take 2 viewings before you really like it. I saw it in the theater and loved it, but I know several people who needed to see it again to ""appreciate"" its humor.As for the reviewer who thinks this is retro, it is apparent that you have never been to rural Idaho. My parents were born and raised there...it's just like that. No, not 2 decades ago. Today."
3,Parts are greater than the whole,"Napoleon Dynamite has some funny scenes. Unfortunately, they do not meld together into a story. Dozens of sub-plots and situations are initiated but then ignored. (milk tasting, thrift store sword, grandmother's boyfriend, and that time travel machine to name a few) I laughed out loud many times while watching this movie, but in the end it seemed pointless. Watching ND gave me the same feeling as watching deleted scenes on other DVDs. The scenes were funny, but they didn't relate to the story and that is why they were cut. On a positive note, the title sequence was excellent. If you want to watch a show about nerds, check out Freaks and Geeks. It has great stories, great characters, and it is funny."
5,I would rate it 10 bazillion stars!!,"This is by far the funniest movie EVER. I agree with the person who said dont expect much from it. You just have to think like a kid (hee hee) and accept it for what it is. I saw it twice too, and i still remember every single funny part. The whole movie is like one big Saturday Night Live skit... so who can resist that?? Napoleon Dynamite is really popular in school, people where Vote for Pedro shirts (youll know what im talking about if you've seen it) and have Napoleons ""chapstick"". I STRONGLY advise you to get this movie!!!!! Buy it today!!!!!!!!!Perfect christmas or hannukah..... or kwanza present for a person who loves hilarious comedy!!! Buy it on amazon TODAY!"
1,Garbage,"This movie was awful overall. It had its moments, but so did Flash Gordon....It was way over-hyped and I'm sick of walking to class hearing kids quote it but it is nice to see an indie film do so well."
1,So bad I threw it in the shredder,Do I need to review it?It is one star because there is nothing less than one.
2,"It used to be good, but you ruined it.","Napoleon Dynamite was a great movie in theaters. It was original and completely pointless, and best of all, about five people in the whole world knew about it. But this all changed when it came out on DVD. It was advertised on MTV and probably your local cable provider, so you didn't have to go all the way to your local underground movie theater to see it. Lucky you! And now you can repeat all the same catch phrases over and over again to annoy all your classmates and suck all the fun out of the movie. Good job. A perfectly genius movie down the tubes all because mainstream America had to get its greasy little claws all over it.[SNEAKILY WRITTEN BY TEENAGE SON OF H.QUINN WHEN H.QUINN WAS OFF DOING SOMETHING ELSE!!]"
1,bad,"this movie is not very good, i would not recommend that you see it. you'd probably be better off watching nightmare on elm street or something."
2,READ THIS INSTEAD OF THE ESSAYS ABOVE!,"Plain and simple this movie just not worth much money, I paid 2 bucks to see it and i said ok... that was ok. But thats it! there was little (if there even was one) plot and the jokes were pretty bland except for 1 or 2 that stood out. Basically if your looking for a good consistent laugh then look else where, if you can view this for free or for really cheap go ahead and watch this. You won't be disappointed (much) but you won't be blown away.O and by the way if you claim this is the best movie you've ever seen then you clearly have not seen many movies, or maybe you just lack taste but i'll give you the benefit of the doubt."
2,I hate when people quote this movie,"It was an okay movie nothing special, it had it's funny parts and it's boring parts where nothing happend. Pedro was funny and it was funny to see the girl from ""andre"" and ""water world"" all grown up but still wasn't all that funny. If you really want some entertainment check out REMEMBERING NEVER's ""GOD SAVE US"" and Ramallah's latest album both great."
2,Napoleon Dynamite - 102-1616942-3664903,"This indie favorite follows Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a quirky, ninja-loving teenager growing up in the far reaches of Idaho. Napoleon's life gets complicated when his shady Uncle Rico (John Gries) shows up, a shy girl (Tina Majorino) starts showing him some attention and his best friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) decides to run for school president. Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2004."
1,Uh.,"There have been some elaborate reviews praising this movie, but.... I think these people were on drugs while they watched it. Because they can't possibly think that this movie was really good. No plot. No point. Awful acting and dialogue. No real humor. Just stupid stuff. Stupid humor usually keeps me quite entertained, as in Dude Where's My Car? and the Scary Movie series. There was funny in that stupid. But in the case of Napoleon Dynamite, the only thing that made me laugh was the fact that it wasn't funny. Just mind numbingly stupid. If you value your braincells... you will stay away from this sorry excuse for a film."
1,Idiots!!! Gosh!,"The popularity of this movie explains why so many states went red in the last election. If clueless morons are endearing to you, by all means see this film, move to the midwest and vote GOP."
1,A Waste of Time,"This movie represents 89 minunits of my life that I can never get back. The charactar looks funny, but isn't. Some of the antics are almost funny, but aren't.I think that this movie is so bad, that people who like bad movies will like it."
2,"Come'on, this is not a 5 star movie","I might have given it 3 stars max because of it's originality, but it's just not that good. There's nothing great about it and it's actually quite boring. This is a good movie for people who are easily amused. I'm sure all the people who ""liked"" it won't appreciate my review here. Oh well."
1,To the contrary,Thier is such thing as a liger its worlds biggest cat trust me i would know im a expert on animals/plant life just did the kids review program since its quicker
5,Flippin sweet film!,"I am compelled to write this review because I'm so bummed by the one star reviews and harsh words of some other reviewers. I must defend Napoleon! This is my favorite movie of 2004, possibly my favorite movie ever. I am an educated, intelligent, mother of three. My 12-year old daughter and I are crazy about Napoleon Dynamite-every time we watch it, we are doubled over with laughter. I suspect this is one of those movies you either love or hate, there's no middle ground. If mainstream humor is more to your taste (I'm thinking Austin Powers or, uh, I don't know, that kind of thing), maybe you should skip ND. But if you want to watch something subtle yet side-splitting, off-kilter but sweet and safe to watch with your kids, this is your movie."
1,hands down the biggest waste of 20 dollars,"once again MTV ""films"" coughs up a complete moronic film that couldnt have been made any worse if the last half hour was just garbled tv snow. i bought this movie the first day it came out. i as alot of other people heard that it was ""hilariously funny."" god once again it shows to me what bile MTV will spit out and people will buy into as funny. ive seen episodes of saved by the bell that were funnier than this, its actually a shame that i bought this movie at full price the day it came out. i was one of those morons that bought into the MTV advertising barrage. i watched this movie and laughed like the first ten minutes (that is a liberal account) and then started to look at my clock to see how much longer this movie was. and after it was finally over i felt as though i had watched a six hour mini series.please if this is even a question of buying this or not, do not buy it, at least wait til it is aired on regular tv. you wont miss anything at all."
1,Movies This Bad Should Be Illegal,"I only gave this movie 1 star because no stars was not an option. It was so hyped that my wife and I watched it. I love dumb humor when done well. But to put this movie in perspective, think of the worst movie you have seen and then rank Napolean Dynamite lower. This movie was such a worthless piece of crap that the producers should have to pay me restitution. I did not laugh once during this pitiful excuse for a movie. After seeing this movie a traffic pileup on the evening news will look funny. Instead of wasting money on this ""movie"", save it and send a thank you or a dollar to anyone who warned you from it."
1,"Way over rated, hipster garbage","This is a terrible movie. The movie creators are just Wes Anderson wannabe's, and not very good one's at that. Possibly the worst writing ever as well, the characters go nowhere. You see them throw footballs, sell tupperware and dance in the auditorium. This film offers nothing. If you want to watch an obscure funny movie then watch 'The Royal Tenenbaums' or 'Rushmore' to just name a couple. Don't waste your time with this one."
1,Try renting first....,"Just didn't get it. The characters were dull and aside from different wardrobe, they all seem to be the same character. I kept waiting for the huge laughter I was hearing about, but I guess the movie ended before that happened. I must have missed the meeting when we all ""decided"" that grade school humor was funny, but if MTV can dictate to a mind numb audience what music to listen to - Hey why not movies too???"
3,Hmm,"I guess I gave this movie this rating because...1. I'm not an adult, just in junior high.2. I hate movies that are slow.3. I thought it was just all around weird.I watched it once by myself and then I watched it again with my mother and she had to explain the ending to me, becuase I didn't get it the first time. Maybe I'm just clueless?"
1,A total bomb in film making!!!,"I really don't see how people could enjoy this movie. I mean it wasn't even that funny. All the funny parts were in the beginning. Which saved no room for the last hour or so of the movie. Also what is with Napolean's friend Deb. I mean look at her hair. People at my school are really annoying because they have that vote for Pedro shirt on. If this review does not appease you contact me at tnisprokingm45@yahoo.com, and tell me why because I am dying to know why people like this movie so much."
1,Waste of a good hour,"I had heard that this was a really funny movie from several of my friends so one night I was bored and decided to pick it up. First let me explain that I am a HUGE movie guy, movies are my life. So I put the movie in expecting some serious gut busting humor. I waited for it to get funny. I kept waiting. After 57 minutes of dialogue that nearly rendered me comatose, I took the movie out and returned it to Blockbuster. It was without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. Kung Pow, another really dumb movie is hilarious in comparison. I beg you not to waste you time and money. If you want some good laughs for the same price I can recomend watching paint dry."
1,Just not my cup of tea,"This is the kind of movie everyone always thinks I'm going to like, because ""it's just so wacky, with these really crazy characters!"" But I didn't think these characters were funny. They just seemed like cliches, cliches of wacky, off-the-beaten-path sorts of people. Predictable cliches, like Napoleon's brother being astounded that his grandma gets annoyed at paying for his hours of internet chat time. Napoleon's constant rudeness was really annoying and off-putting, and I didn't see what was funny about him saying ""sweet"" or ""gosh"" or ""idiots!"" all the time.The only two funny parts for me were: when the farmer shoots the cow in front of the kid-filled school bus, and Uncle Rico's reaction when Napoleon pelts his van with a grapefruit.I'm 36 so I think maybe I'm just too old to get this. Maybe it's like ""Repo Man"" was for my generation, I don't know. I liked ""Repo Man,"" but ""Napoleon Dynamite"" was just not doing it for me."
1,worst movie i have ever seen. i only laughed once.,"i cant believe that i wasted my time on such a pointless movie. i cant believe that people even take the time to watch this movie. this was horrible, i hate it, its sucks, what else can i say? its stupid. just dont waste your time watching this. watch something else. peace."
1,not that dynamite,"this movie is far from funny and dvd special features aside and quality sound and video, this movie is dumb and I would not recomend even renting it save your money or buy a film with class. I tried to watch it twice and after giving it a chance I could still find no redeeming qualities. Every body who I have spoken to who enjoyed the film are under 21 years old, every one else hated it. I hate this movie and thats hard to believe because I like some pretty stupid movies."
1,GOD!! THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!!,"Ok, i watched this movie for 45 minutes and i got so bored i tured on Dora the Explorer and watched benny the bull fall down a hill. (This is a show on a baby channal). My friends say i didn't understand the humor of this movie. They say it is so stupid it was funny. I think its so stupid...its stupid. I don't care if a guy wants a ""quesidiilla"" or if he rides on rollar skates on the back of a guys bike. I didn't feel the characters, and i couldn't connect with the character. How? Well, i have never tied a string to an action figure and thrown it out my bus window, or put tater tots in my pocket for later. This movie teaches nothing has no moral, makeds no sense, about as entertaining as a lightswitch, and seems as if the produces, script writers, and cienimatographers and the casting was all done by freakish German monkeys. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!! THE BOTTOM LINE:(drumroll) It stinks. (duh!)"
3,Leave out the Cyndi Lauper songs,"You couldn't have missed the hoopla surrounding this film. Everyone wanted your tots and all your co-workers played the sound boards too much at work. I don't think the dance scene was all that flippin hot. Although I would have voted for Pedro over Summer anyday. It is true though, there is a Summer Wheatley in every high school. A good reason to allow firearms in schools.Leave out the Cyndi Lauper song ""Time After Time"" in these retro films. It has been done to death. Romey and Michelle anyone?"
4,Enjoyable geek flick...,"I find this movie gets funnier every time I watch it (and I've watched it a few times). Someone mentioned that Pedro doesn't smile until the end of the movie, but thinking about it I don't think many of the characters do.People like what they like, and I guess you need to have a warped sense of humor, an appreciation for corny comedy, or a love for geeks to appreciate this film. I'd watch it again (and I'm about to add it to my DVD collection)."
1,Beyond Bad,"Napoleon Dynamite is beyond merely bad. It is really bad. It is disjointed. It has no plot and no action.It was supposed to be about a week in the life of some high school 'nerds'. There was really nothing holding it together.There were a couple of funny spots in the show, but it is certainly not one that I would recommend. I really thought that it was a total waste of 90 minutes. Do yourself a favor and get something else instead."
1,worst movie ever,"this movie was so bad, when the other reviewers are creating parameters just to watch the movie you know its bad. if i have to be a certain age or have a certain level of dorkiness about me to enjoy the movie, then its a dorky movie, a dorky terrible movie. not even worth renting"
1,glad it wasn't my money,"Some friends of mine rented this movie and supersize me and brought it over to watch, choosing the lesser of two evils (we had just eaten dinner) we opted for this flick. While I will admit there were a couple parts where I was forced to laugh at the sheer stupidity of the characters, this ranks right up there with Blair Witch Project where I kept expecting it to get better. My problem with this movie is that I felt like I wasted my time watching it when I could have done something way more interesting. Maybe I just don't get it or can't empathize with the characters, I thought the little romance was cute and the grandma was cool, but overall I think I just found the main character to be really dumb. sorry to all you guys who really liked it, maybe you're better than me too."
3,Many memorable quotes. Not many memorable scenes.,"I have actually been to Preston, Idaho. It is an examplar of many small rural towns in the western United States. It shows a great geek in action.This movie is a lot like ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". The after conversation and interminable quoting of the movie is a lot funnier than the actual movie. But it is not first-rate comedy. I think the polarized responses of either loving the movie or hating it are representative of this kind of movie. It belongs in the deadpan hall of fame along with the Holy Grail and It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World."
3,Napoleon Dynamite,"Okay, the first time I tried to watch the movie I couldn't get through 20 minutes. I sat there thinking WHO IN THE WORLD WOULD FIND THIS MOVIE FUNNY. But then, the second time, I watched it with a group of friends and was forced to sit there in misery. Well, I wasn't in so much pain after all. You really have to watch this with the right group of people. Some parts of it are, I admit, quite great and hilarious. I can now understand why some people find it so funny. However, I'm still not a fan of this movie."
2,...uneven,"Rented this one the other day. It does have a few laugh out loud funny moments....but they are kinda few and far inbetween. It's worth checking out anyway. One of the funniest things about this movie is one of the supporting charactors. There is a girl that Pedro takes to the dance, and later Napoleon starts to date...its one of the daughters from that icky Meg Ryan movie where Meg plays a drunk and her husband is a pilot and he is trying to hold the family together, etc. Forgot the name of it. Oh yeah, its called ""When a man loves a women."" Anyway, one of the little girls in that movie, one that Meg kicks around when she is drunk, is in this movie, and of coarse has grown up a bit since then. See if you can recognize her.If you liked something like ""Welcome to the dollhouse"" then you might like this one. There is just a lot of really random crazy stuff happening in it. The dance sequence at the student council presentations is crazee...probably the highlight of the movie."
5,Totally Funny!!!,"ALl I have to say is this is one funny movie. I couldn't stop laughing! After seeing the movie the first time, I had to run out and buy it."
4,Hilarious,"If you've been to high school, you'll recognize so many characters here, it will be almost excruciating to watch. Napoleon's brother and his uncle however, are in a class by themselves -- losers like you've never seen. Outrageous humor here -- but don't forget to watch AFTER THE CREDITS: a whole scene is there that you don't want to miss."
4,Sweet!,"This is a movie you will definately have to watch twice... If you have heard nothing about it and just randomly watch it you will think what the??? But try not to watch the movie to follow a particular storyline, just sit back and enjoy the daily adventures of Napoleon and friends. Awesomely funny movie."
4,"Odd, but very fun and likeable","Imagine if David Lynch was asked to direct a live action Beavis and Butthead with a plot written by John Hughes. That's not a great way to describe Napolean Dynamite, but it's the best I can come up with.This is actually a very good movie. It tells the story of dimwitted but kindhearted Napolean and his quirky group of family and friends as he navigates things like the school dance and class elections. His new found buddy Pedro and he compete, to some extent anyway, for the affection of the same girl. Napolean's uncle babysits while his grandma's hurt from an ATV accident and buys a time machine. You get the idea. There is great depth of character and Uncle Rico is just funny as hell.I think everyone will enjoy this on some level. It's how movies should be done."
4,Wins points for its uniqueness,"Even if you don't like this movie, you gotta admit, it's at least different. This movie has developed a large cult following, and to be honest I am not sure why certain people continue to spew quotes and think this is the greatest movie ever. There are cute little nostalgic moments, such as the ridiculously long phone cord (some of you remember when phones had cords...) So in conclusion, it's a good movie, but not a GREAT movie."
5,BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,"When I had first heard of this movie I was a bit skeptical about seeing it. I thought it would be this dumb, low budget movie, but it wasent. I got this movie as a christmas gift so I watched it and it was soooo funny. Each scene was very funny, I couldent stop laughing.The movie is about a dorky teenager living in a small town. He goes to school like any other kid and makes freinds and atempts to get a girlfreind for the Prom and some how succeds in doing so.I think this is a good dvd to buy I would highly reccomend it to anyone.Thank you for reading my review, I hope it was helpful."
5,"Buy this DVD, idiot!","There are some people who found this movie to be tiring, a boring plotless low key movie with no action and no big productive stunts. I was definately not one of those people. Napolean is one of the funniest characters ever seen in modern movies. His detachment from reality is unbelievable, and his supporting cast is flawless. If you can't laugh at his wacky character and dorky antics then you are an idiot! Gosh!""Its like my favorite animal, its a Liger...It's half lion half tiger, bread for its skills in magic""as an edit, this movie has not stopped playin in my dvd player since i got it. The lines get better and better each time and the ending dance sequence never tires me. This movie is a hilarious masterpiece that stands the test of time."
5,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE I'VE SEEN IN A REALLY LONG TIME!!!,"When I went to see this in the theatre I didn't know what to expect. I even thought ""Oh geez did I just waste my money?"". Boy, was I EVER wrong. I never leave a movie for anything, but I was laughing so hard I had to use the bathroom. Jared Hess's role is brilliant, funny, heart-warming and just down right hysterical!!! I loved it! This is a great movie to add to your collection. I know I definitely am!"
2,I just don't understand the popularity of this movie,"I don't understand why this movie got such great reviews. It certainly wasn't an intelligent comedy, if comedy is what it was intended to be. It was simply painful to watch; almost as if a bunch of high school students made it themselves. Ugh."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made By MTV Films,Wow and I thought joe's apartment was bad !MTV has lower there standards from making this film.Never want to see any movies that has Jon Heder in it.Shame on everyone who wasted money on this !
4,Not the average comedy,"Napoleon Dynamite is defintley the kind of movie that ""Airplane!"" was in the sense of all of the stupid-funny humaor they turn this movie into. I laughed alot during the movie but I felt like it could have been much much better; but at the same time, I have no idea how it could have been better. I recommend you see this movie but I say if you can rent it first or see it in any way that you can without purchasing it, such as at a friend's house. That way you can see if you like it or not without being stuck with the DVD."
2,Its ok..,"I bought it cause everyone said how good it was... but i was not happy with what I saw, I think its because I was expecting something so funny that when I saw it, it wasn't. I just didnt laugh like I thought I would.. I actually fell asleep during some of it"
5,I've Learned to Like It. :),"At first, I couldn't STAND this movie! I mean what was the big deal with this thing?? I saw it and I thought it was ridiculous and I was all too excited when the film ended. BUT. For some ODD reason, this thing has grown on me and I've learned to like it. The reason why, because it's different! And it's reality! I loved the unique characters and I look forward into getting my hands on to this movie. :)"
2,High School High,"Those who went through high school high on weed will relate to this movie. That's the impression you get of Napoleon (Jon Heder) in Napoleon Dynamite...that he's high all the time.Basically the movie follows this kid (Napoleon) through a monotony of high school and family situations. Napoleon responds to these situations as if in a drug induced stupor. In this film his loser character/attitude prevails when faced with conflict; hence, his state of stupor is glorified to heroism which is probably why a few teen's and young adults think that it's cool to mimic Napoleon's character.There are some amusing scenes. But mostly I found myself chuckling thinking ""what an idiot"".Napoleon Dynamite is an over-rated film for MTV junkies.Purchase it? No way, Dude."
4,"Fun movie, but a little bit over-hyped...","First for the actual review: for what it is, Napoleon Dynamite is a good movie. It's funny and offbeat, it's somewhat different, it has likeable characters, and it's a fun story about a bunch of high school losers that holds your interest and gives you some laughs.However... this movie is also overrated. I mean, you can't go anywhere without seeing a ""Vote For Pedro"" or ""Gimme Your Tots"" shirt, and almost everyone on facebook.com is in a Napoleon Dynamite group. I think people think a little TOO much of this movie. Like I said, it's a good movie, but wow... people, please...Despite this, I still give it a recommendation. Just don't expect Raging Bull."
5,But my lips hurt real bad!,"If deadpan humor goes over your head, you should stay away from Napolean Dynamite. The comedy is brilliant. The writing is great. It is understated, dry humor though. Think of Wes Anderson movies like Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums - it's in that genre of comedy. If you want prat falls and sight gags, you are better off with any Jim Carrey movie.In short - you'll either love this movie or hate it. No middle ground for this one. I personally love it."
1,The worsted Flippen' movie ever!!!!!!!!!!!,This movie is crap. End of story. This movie is so horrible that it falls under my list of movies that a destroying the movie business. It's go's right next to the new King Kong and the new Superman movie. I did not laugh ones through the whole movie. I can not understand why anyone in there right mined would think this movie should get 5 stars.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"This movie is even worse than Spirited Away! I didn't even laugh once. The jokes are so corny, The storyline makes you wanna vomit, and the characters act so dumb! The movie takes place in a depressing farm-like community.Overall: If you like corny jokes and a depressing storyline, this is the movie for you."
1,I want my 1:26 back!,"My son (who is 10) asked us to get this via NetFlix - since one of his classmates saw it and told him it was funny. Well, we rented it, watched it and I was totally unimpressed. This has to be the lamest movie I have ever seen in my 41 years of living. It was as mind numbing as an episode of the Teletubbies.I laughed twice: when Napolean botches jumping the ramp with his bike and when Kip runs over the tupperware bowl. His dance at the very end was pretty good. Two songs used in the soundtrack: Cyndi Lauper's ""Time After Time"" and When In Rome's ""The Promise"" were the high points in the film for me.The rest of it left me wondering ""what the...?"". Very bad."
1,horrible movie,This movie is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. It not comendy it stupidty. It has no plot at all
1,The WORST movie of all time.....,"Giving this movie ""1"" star was difficult for me. Having never been moved enough to write an online review before, I was truly hoping you could give negative scores as ratings. Without going over an utterly rediculous storyline and the grossly exagerated characters found in this never-ending ""drag-on and go nowhere"" story, I will sum it up in one word ""flop""I am an avid movie-goer and dvd collector. It doesn't take an academy award winning performace to make me enjoy a movie. But this movie was equal to me handing my 10 year old a camcorder and cutting him loose at home and school without edits! This is the first movie I ever bought after hearing how ""funny"" it was and purposely scratching it so I could return it with my receipt to a local store. It was THAT BAD!!! If, like me you are still compelled to see the movie and no one was honest enough to warn you off, then spend as little money as possible, rent before you buy!!! You will thank me later!"
1,Boring!,"I think that naploean dynomite is the lowest form of comedy today. All it is is this looser who knows he is and says some dumb lines, and every one thinks this movie is good. Did i loose the point of the movie some where, or is this just stupid. when i saw it i thaught it was dumb to begin with. Whithin the first ten minutes i was about to go to sleep. So I give it a 1 out of 5 stars.~Goldpetal"
1,what is this garbage,what are you people thinking this is not funny stuff. now ill admit it is funny the way he talks but that is all.no doubt about it im a huge fan of movies that do not have a point but this is flat out stupid. do not think the movie is funny and buy it just cuz the preveiws look funny.
1,Couldn't wait for it to end,"Well I rented this movie because a co-worker told me how hilarious it was. There were a couple of scenes that made me crack a smile and chuckle a bit, and I did like the dance scene at the end and the way the movie ended was good, but otherwise, I basically sat there straight-faced the entire movie, constantly glancing at the ""time-elapsed"" clock on my dvd player, counting down the time that was left in the movie because I couldn't wait to get done watching it and take it back to the video store. This movie is just boring, plotless, and isn't very funny at all, save a couple small laughs here and there. And yes, I ""get"" the humor, it just didn't work for me."
2,not impressed,"yeah that's right, i said it. i was not impressed. maybe it's because i chose not to see the movie right away. maybe it's because everyone and their mother was telling me i HAD to see it. maybe it's because my stupid neighbor saw it before i did and loved it. maybe it was the high school kids i heard quoting the movie when i passed them on the street, i don't know.i think it's because i can think of loads of other movies that don't add content that talks down to me. i can think of movies with real, legitimate wit and dry humor; movies that aren't so obvious at trying to be ""different.""there were a few funny lines, yes, but for the most part, this movie was a huge disappointment. huge."
2,Average at best,"I Can appreciate different types of Films but I also know when I have seen films that are pretty predictable after a while. this film had some funny moments but much like Revenge of the Nerds you can dig the charm but after a while things become formula driven. I got the film&didn't have a problem with it,but it just didn't move me fully."
5,"The Funniest Film since Spinal Tap, THE BEST FILM OF 2004.","This is the funniest movie since Spinal Tap. The people on here who give it one star reveal their Paris Hilton level low IQ's. You will especially love this film if you grew up in rural America- very real and very hysterical. It is so brilliant that Haylie Duff is in it, ridiculed as a typical rural barely pretty chick with an attitude, and she doesn't even know it. This is a film that you will end up watching over and over again much like Spinal Tap or even Shawshank Redemption."
3,Napoleon Dynamite,"This wasn't the greatest movie. It was actually kind of studid and lame. It had no point to it, but it was hilarious. Just the things napoleon said were hilarious along with the other characters in the movie. He did what he wanted to and likes to draw cartoons and animal beasts. Its about napoleon and his 2 new friends that decide to elect his friend pedro for class president."
1,Complete Crap,I hate this movie. The charaters are stupid and there is no storyline and Napoleon is so dumb I wanted to take a baseball bat and hit him with it. I hate this movie with every fiber of my being its complete crap. Dont waste your time with this unless you like stupid people and stupid movies or if you are just stupid because you would have to be to like this BS excuse of a movie
1,I HATE PEDRO!,"I went and saw this movie in the most open of minds. I knew i was probably not gonna like it but i was still leaving the door open to being pleasantly surprised. when i came out i wanted to kill everyone at my school for recommending this movie or for chanting in unison ""gosh!"" or ""your mom goes to college."" I know that many people cannot be mentally challenged, then again they did recommend this movie. a waste of time. I hate this movie, I'm glad i didn't pay to see this crap. The only funny part of this entire movie was when they shot that thing right in front of the school bus. Now that was funny, rest of the movie not so much. avoid at all costs. TOO LATE!"
1,Why did I watch this?,"File under so stupid it might be funny. The only redeeming part of this movie is that it is short. Also, keep watching after the credits, Lafawnda and Ted get married."
2,Not the worst I have seen...,"This movie came highly recommended to me. It was not the worst movie I have seen, and I did sit through the entire flick. However, Napoleon and his bunch were much too flat. If it was only Napoleon that was deadpan, then the quirkiness of the others may have worked. The uncle was the only interesting character. About the only nice thing I can say is that Napoleon put forth a fairly accurate portrayal of a student with Asperger syndrome that also has some serious emotional issues. He should have been picked on more at school for the film to be accurate. I may use a scene from this movie when presenting on Autistic Spectrum Disorder because Rain Man was so overrated. As one reviewer suggested to me, ""This movie grows on you."" I doubt it, but only time will tell. If you want offbeat comedy, try Office Space instead."
1,And this is supposed to be funny?,"So here we have it: one of the worst films of all time. This is ridiculously bad. Maybe it's supposed to be bad, like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes? Come on, Bob Dylan's about 1,000,000 times funnier than whoever wrote the script for this album, and Dylan doesn't even write comedy for a living!Anyway, this is really really bad. There is no plot. And the jokes... ""Bow to your sensei!"" ""Give me some of your tots!"" ""Vote for Pedro!"" ""Flippin' Sweet!"" ""Gosh!""...these are supposed to be funny? No. Definetly no. There is a reason why this got such bad review from the press, people! It's bad!And now kids are walking around with Napolean Dynamite t-shirts and quoting it at every possible opprotunity. What has the film industry become? Argh!If you want REAL funny stuff, go with the Simpsons, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, or classic Dylan albums. If you want mindless drivel, this is your outlet! Just don't say I didn't warn you!"
3,Definitely overrated.,"I was interested in this movie because of all the hype and the nerd on the front. I think I saw some trailers too but I can't remember.This movie was good here and there but largely boring. It definitely had potential but it was wasted. It's mostly a bunch of retards moving around and talking, barely making sense sometimes. If I wanted to watch a bunch of retards I would go to an assisted living facility, not waste the $5 on the movie rental fee.They had a lot of material and they hit the mark sometimes but really they dropped the ball. There are definitely some ""LOL"" moments but the rest of the time it's boring. Also, the quotes people like to use from this movie are not that good. This is definitely not a ""Caddyshack"" if you know what I mean.Don't listen to the hype. It's good for a rental but that's it. If I had to keep watching it I'd start getting violent. Could have been better but it's not."
2,One rather lame joke,This film is funny...if you're a stoned tosser with a peer group preasure sense of humour.One joke...and that's not even that funny....I got reviewing skills.
2,Narpolean Dynamites confusin' movie,"Narpolean Dienamite was a real good history comedy movie 'but one of them guys that called narpolean who like to give veggies to them other peoples, he is an atomic Bomber and he bombs narpolean haters.The guy who plays him has one of them Big Afro-dasiacs so i'm quite sure why them casters picked this guy to play narpolean, shoulda gotteh brad pitterson!Go getter this movie if y'all wants to see historians do bomb like Farenheit 11 and other stuffs, go america!"
3,Look closer: how patehic could be life's some american people?,"First: this is not a masterpiece or something like this. But in a way it is a very good eye in the contemporary life's in some ordinary people. After watch this movie you could get the answers from many questions:1) How bad and insane is the life's many people in USA2) Why women usually are wiser than men3) The whole society in United States have a big problem called happiness and just know to live4) What happens with the people who forget life's too short and the world outside it's too big and diverse5) How strong is the absence of variety in most americans6) How Mr Bush could be the President in this societyAnyways, rent it (don't buy it) and taste some bitter sensation."
1,Worst film of '04,"Only stoners and 10-year olds would like this one-joke movie. It's like one of those SNL skits that are stretched to feature-length films.The skit, in this instance, is hardly bearable to begin with."
2,Wheres the plot?,"This is my first review here and I decide to write it on this over hyped movie. I thought the plot was non-existant and very lacking in actual comedic substance. The characters were unique and pretty well made up, however they did nothing. I am a big comedy freak, but there is tooooooo much hype on this movie. I would watch a sequel to this just to see what they do to the characters, but this one was a disapointment."
1,What a WASTE!!!!,"If I could give this movie a zero, trust me, I would. This movie was so boring and stupid! This is what the story is about.1. A geek named Napoleon who lives in the middle of nowhere2. Meets this new Hispanic guy and becomes his friend3. The Hispanic guy likes the popular girl named Summer4. Napoleon thinks that his friend can win class President against the popular girl Summer5. They go to a dance6. Napoleon learns to dance7. The End (Plus, Napoleon always says ""Freakin Idiot"")This movie was a total waste of time. When I went to the movies to see it, the theater was about half full. And about 30 minutes after it started me, my mom, and my friend were the only ones left! Everyone else had gone! I was falling asleep and had to be woken up when it ended. Just goes to show, that the movie critics were actually right this time!"
1,if I could give it a half star (Stander same week),"I would,, I got it, it's nerd madness... and I did not like it. But for some reason I watched it all the way to the crappy marrage sceen at the end,, I don't know why, I wouldn't watch it again though and thats how I rate movies. This is overated schlock. (if it's based in the 70s which set direction and feel make it feel then what the hell is with the internet and messaging a black woman that would in my opinion have nothing to do with this guy) Now if the lead actors is like that in real life it's even more schlock. If he is completely opposite he should get an oscar because completely boring films always win. Who wins this guy or Jamie Fox in Collateral!?.. this is sundance at it's finest,, Now blockbuster had a whole wall full of them and only 3 Stander DVDs which I found much more entertaining...!!!"
1,And the point is... ?,"This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Now, I was a child in the early 80's and I hated it then.The movie only served to exasperate me: No plot, no conflict, no resolution. Only the insecure faux-machismo and mouth breathing of ""Napoleon Dynamite"" and cast. The acting was bad, the setting was terrible, there was absolutely no point to this movie. It embodied yet another film, trying to capitalize on the wave of ""jump in the wayback machine"" B-movies and shows. ""That 70's show"" worked. This didn't."
1,Not What The Reviews Say,"Should I even give this story one star! I think not.Bland characters- Napoleon is dumb, Deb is weird, and Pedro needs to get a life. Not characters you want to hear about.No plot- there is no purpose to the movie. Napoleon tries to get a girl, Pedro tries to become class president--that's not a plot. It's just a mishmash of bad ideas.So we have dumb people doing dumb things. How entertaining this that? Who are these brain-washed people who actually enjoyed this movie? What a wasted of...what...2 hours...oh my life. To anyone who wants to watch a plotless movie with bad characters, this movie is for you. If not, I highly request that you skip over it. There are better movies out there, like Mean Girls and Harry Potter.Napoleon Dynamite Hater"
1,Just plain awful,"This movie is so awful. There are a few chuckle moments if you think someone getting hit in the face with a steak, or ...well actually that was the only chuckle moment. I was bored stiff and actually started reading a book during it. I can't believe I finished it but it certainly wasn't worth it."
1,If I could give it less that one star I would! WASTE OF FILM,"This movie is a waste of energy on your DVD player. This movie is not funny, I HATED IT! People told me this may be the greatest comedy ever, they LIED! This movie has no real plot, and is extremely unoriginal. Making fun of mexicans named Pedro is not comedy to me. If you want real comedy get ""Freddy Got FIngered"" staring Tom Green and Rip Torn. Now thats a movie that will keep you laughing."
2,One-note joke that goes on for 75 minutes to long,"This movie was pointless, plotless, and non-sensical. OK, he's a rebel geek, we get it. Bad hair, bad teeth, no dance moves. The other characters were also pretty much one-dimensional as well. The material might have been suited to a skit on SNL, not an entire movie. There were some funny parts in this movie like the steak to the head, the button throw, and the ill-fated ramp jump(hence the 2 star rating) but most of it was pretty boring. Repeatedly saying ""gosh"" in a stuffed-nose tone doesn't really do it for me, and certainly not for $20."
4,I *think* I liked it...,"Napoleon Dynamite is a strange movie, and it made me painfully aware of my own inherent geekiness (I remember fixing my hair like Deb's, way back in the 80s...). But I still liked it...I think."
4,simply summed up...,"Here's the deal with this movie.....If you are the kind of person who needs the laughter button to remind you that a certain part of a movie/tv show is funny then this flick is not for you. On the other hand, if you have any sense of humor I really can't see how you couldn't enjoy this movie. The characters are all cleverly made and the idea behind the movie is truly original. Napolean is the poster-child for a dork, dork, dork....He wears black snow boots in the summer for crying out loud! This is definatley a ""cult"" movie on par with ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""Army of Darkness,"" ""The Warriors,"" ect, ect, ect. You will either know all the lines to the movie or you will watch it once and never again. hope that helps."
4,Funny movie,"This is a sweet, funny movie, also very goofy, and endearing at times. Great for tween boys at a slumber party."
5,Not the best movie ever but . . .,"I just saw this movie on DVD last night I laughed hard. My wife did not. I thought it was funny and fun to watch. My wife thought it was ""mean."" I thought almost every scene was funny. My wife was bored and kept commenting on how slow it was. This is the magic of Napoleon Dynamite. Either you get it or you don't. I get it. It has many layers of meaning. Its deadpan delivery masks layers of emotions. The movie happens inside of you not on the screen. On one level or another we are all like Napoleon. And although we are not as imobilized or socially retarded like him, we all have had our awkward moments, and our moments of triumph. And like Napoleon, if we have his integrity, we come through it all with our PRIDE INTACT. This is what this movie meant to me. And besides the time machine scene made me laugh so hard it ""killed."""
1,Agree with Roger Ebert on this...,"To enjoy this movie you either need to be, A) so bored by life that this film is somehow funny to you, because the characters are that pathetic, OR B) you feel sorry for them... again, because the characters are really that pathetic. Neither of these is a reason to waste your time watching the movie, much less be obsessed with this film. Watching a dog do it's business or watching paint dry is more fun. The intro of the movie with all the creative ways they display the credits would be the only good part of the movie. People, go live some life... don't waste it on this film. Strive to be more than this."
1,This is by far the biggest waste of time and money ever spent!,"Have you seen ""The Blair Witch Project?"" If you have then you are aware that it was not up to movie standards, and the same holds true for this movie. It has elementary humor at best and has no plot throughout he movie. The only thing the movie supports is a school election for his friend Pedro. The characters in the movie are weak and less than humorous for the buzz that the movie recieved. I am a big movie go-er and have seen several titles, but when they said that this was must see humor then what the heck has happened to our movies today?"
1,Absolute garbage,"My teenage daughter purchased this lump of crap and played it for us tonight. After what seemed like hours of torture my reaction was: ""Was the local dung seller out of product???"".There is nothing that remotely passes for humor in this *cough* movie. The characters are poorly written, the plot is more mundane than most recent ""teen"" movies and its only devotees seem to be the same group that find Ashlee Simpson talented. Well, it does have a redeeming factor: IT EVENTUALLY ENDS! The next time I want this amount of excitement, I'll watch my toenails grow.Please, do yourself a favor, use a home-lobotomy kit on yourself before you buy this garbage....only then would it appear to be funny."
1,Very Original Opening Credits,I just don't get it. I guess I'm just an oldfardt. The only time I laughed during this film was when Napolean was trying to jump the make-shift ramp with his bike. I do give 1 star for the very original opening credit sequence.
4,Dull but sparkles,"Deadpan comedies often become underground cult favorites, panned by most critics but loved by most audiences, and this is true with the deadest of all deadpan-ers Napoleon Dynamite. An Idahoan myself, I left the theater mixed between utter embarrassment at my state and humorous at how stupid but charming ND ended up being. Starring child star Tina Majorino in the role of Deb, the quiet keep-to-herself girl that befriends Napoleon and eventually becomes his secret flame, and Hilary Duff's sister Haylie, Napoleon Dynamite has a plot that is as scant as Britney Spears' wardrobe, but nonetheless it remains an entertaining piece of fluff. If you enjoy stupid movies then Napoleon is for you; if not, then avoid this movie."
3,Add An Extra Star If You Like,"Napoleon Dynamite certainly panders the MTV fans, not the music fans, but the those responsible for more than one season of ""The Real World"". While the film is slow and boring, and at times painfully so, it does not purport to be anything else. It's not trying to be and American Pie teen-movie: gross-out humor and a high-school-(...)(not that there isn't a place for that in American film). The humor is very sporadic but quick, and most significantly, RANDOM. If you haven't asked yourself ""What in the hell am I watching?"" every ten minutes for the first half-hour, then you don't understand the humor in this movie: Stereotyped characters, dead-pan high school comedy, keep your eye on the dweeb and don't expect to be spoiled by luxuries like background music. Most people will either love it or hate it. I, on the other hand, found it ""OK""."
4,"Hardly perfect, but original and well worth seeing for many","This is one of those movies you will either love or hate, because it consists entirely of a certain kind of deadpan humor that involves setting up the most bizarre, stupid situations ever and having its characters act in really strange ways, but never once acknowleging its a joke. It has no plot and no characters who serve as anything but jokes.So it comes down entirely to whether you like the type of humor in it. My advice: watch the first 15 minutes, and if you haven't laughed really hard a couple of times by then, then don't bother, because you'll hate it. If this is your kind of humor though, you will love this movie. Like I did."
4,Pretty darn hilarious!,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was along the lines of Rushmore, but with quite a bit less to the plot. It was, however, VERY funny, very unique, and heartfelt. The main characters are not to be pitied, but admired for their kindness, uniqueness, and good attitude (except when feeding a pet llama...) ;)I don't know why some folks don't seem to like it, unless they can't get past the indie vibe oozing from the movie. It's quirky, choppy, and it almost seems ""homemade"", but it's a wonderful movie and I would say almost ANY age could watch this movie safely. There are very few ""adult-like"" themes and no swearing whatsoever.Just a good buddy, feel good, hilarious movie. I took away one star because the plot could have been punched up quite a bit."
4,OK For Kids To See,"This a ""clean"" movie that anyone can watch with their kids. True, Napolean is a nerd, but he is a funny one. My family liked it so much that we are getting it for my 7 year old nephew's birthday. The subtle humor is delightful. My son has already watched it three times in the last week!"
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!,"I have seen this movie and I think that it is the absolute WORST movie in history. The jokes are corny, and the movie just has no point. I don't know why everyone raves about this movie it is totally overrated>"
2,Napoleon Dynamite -the big disappointment,"I was totally let down by this movie, the previews show the funniest parts of the movie, the only funny parts!It had it's moments but they were short lived.A HUGE disappointment over all, I'm glad I bought it on sale.."
1,Not so great,"I don't know if I missed something from the movie, but I didn't find it that great. Yes, I laughed a little bit, some scenes were very fun... but... the guy is so dumb that instead of laughing I was getting upset. I'm kind of dissapointed. Maybe I heard too many good comments about this film that I was expecting too much. My husband bought the DVD without watching it first based on the good reviews. We both watched it together and then we both regret the purchase, so if you are planing to buy this DVD without checking the movie first, I recommend you to rent it and then decide if you really want to buy it. I guess 'Napoleon Dynamite' is not a movie that everyone will enjoy."
1,Like the most boring movie ever!,"Nothing happens in this movie. Nothing. All of the 'humor' involves characters stereotyped to the point of hyperbolic. It's marginally racist too. The Mexicans are thugs in a lowrider and the one black person is all 'ghetto booty' and is just there to teach the lame white boy how to be cool.""Duurrrrr your mom goes to college!""Thank God the constant quotation of this thing in the past.If you want 'loser' comedy then Beavis and Butthead is so much better. So is Daria."
5,Sweet!,"Well written, well acted - this is an engaging and funny film. 2004 was an abysmal year for movies made in the U.S. and this is by far one of the best."
4,If You Grew Up In The '80s,"If You Grew Up In The '80s, when it was socially acceptable to beat kids up at their lockers and humiliate kids because of their a) clothes b)social status c) ethnicity d)gender then you will cheer for this film, because for once, the underdog comes out on top. It's like ""Billy Elliot"" for the U.S.And the music was great!"
2,Strange,"Napoleon Dynamyite is just one of those movies that you see when you have nothing better to do. It has no plot and no suspense whatsoever. Basically a random assortment of bizarre scenes about a geek (Napoleon) and his life, it makes audiences laugh hysterically. But what is so funny about a movie with no purpose?"
5,One of the coolest movies ever,What's this? A comedy that is actually funny? Napoleon Dynamite is so well done and obviously on a shoestring budget... I can't get over it. It's chock full of genius joke vehicles and is immediately quotable. I especially like the timeless nature of it. It seems like it could be taking place anywhere from the 80's up until now. The time machine bits are absolutely priceless as well as almost every single thing that comes out of Napoleon's mouth.
3,Good yet overrated,"Once again I'm reviewing another movie that was completely overrated. Completely overquoted. Napoleon Dynamite is a movie about a nerd, his nerd brother, and his 2 nerd friends. It's an original idea and has a different feel for it than most independent films and is, i grant you, better than quite a few indies, but overall it just WASN'T that good. If you're one of those people sitting there saying, ""Hey it won MTV movie awards best movie of the year!"" ... give me a break. This movie was MADE by MTV, of course they're going to give it a better rating than anyone ELSE in the WORLD. Not to mention MTV is just a ridiculous channel anyway, MUSIC television anyone? I don't want to watch shows consisting of idiot celebrity marriages, celebrity houses, and celebrities getting pranked, err umm, ""punk'd""."
5,rewatchable and never boring,"For some reason I didn't think of this movie in terms of geeks or losers or outcasts, I just watched it as a quirky movie with quirky characters, all of it taking place in a surreal movie world. Why try to equate this movie with reality? It's just a nostalgia-tainted movie that shows one weird scene after another. Anyone who was a teen in the early 80's will love the atmosphere, anyone living in rural America will grin at the scenery, but other than that...c'mon, let's just chalk these characters up to playful cinematic fun. I've seen this movie, like, around 10 times or so, and never has it bored me. Each time I watch it, there's always something new I find funny or interesting."
3,Napoloen Blu Ray,"There are extras not in the DVD version, but the studio's Blu Ray quality as far as picture goes is poor."
5,"Refreshing, funny, and the best comedy of the year","My wife and I both love this movie. It's such a refreshing change and illustrates that you can show a comedy that is not laced with profanity and nudity to be effective. Napolean is the dork that we can all relate to in some odd way. From his odd comments (""I love your sleeves, they're real big"") to his quirky habits (""Liger"" drawings) we all have a hidden Napolean Dynamite waiting to be unleashed on the world. The ending of the movie is both uplifting and inspiring.I also loved the dance scene. My only regret is that we don't witness Dynamite's reaction to the audience's applause as we do his successfully elected friend (Efren Ramirez appearing as ""Pedro Sanchez;"" you may have already seen a ""Vote for Pedro"" tee shirt at a mall near you.)The sub plots are also appealing. Most funny is his brother Kip's pursuit of internet chat room hottie LaFawnduh Lucas (""I'm 100% positive she's my soul mate."")"
4,hmm,"This show reminds me a lot of Blair Witch in that you either love it or hate it. I personally loved it, it is charming, sweet, painful, funny and oh so human. Perhaps it is more of a show for people who like observing human behavior.And someone mentioned Ebert, I personally disagree with most of what he thinks...I like Roeper much better :)"
4,Comedy On a Different Frequency,"Most of the people I know who've seen this movie absolutely loved it. And they can't stop quoting it.I'd heard about it when it was making the rounds on the festival circuit last year and wondered what it was like. Since it was successful in festivals, I wondered if it was going to be a dry, insufferable ""comedy"" like THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, perhaps the most overrated, pretentious film I've ever seen.But NAPOLEON is funny. The characters are so off-the-wall that the story looks like pure chaos for the first half. But there is a story and it's fun to watch it all come together. (Be sure to stick around for the wedding sequence following the end credits).You'll either love it or hate it. And, if you love it, you'll laugh more than you have at any Hollywood comedy in years."
3,There's some life in it,"Well, it's not your typical movie, and not your typical comedy to boot. I don't think I've seen a PG film in quite some time. Nothing in this movie is serious, and the characters don't really evoke much emotion.But it's somewhat quirky and there are some funny moments.I will say the dance for Pedro is classic and I was surprised the director let the character ""come out of his shell"" so to speak.Rent it to see if it's your type of movie. ome will join the cult, others will spit on it, but it is what it is."
4,Freakin Sweet!,"This movie is so stupid, its funny! While there is absolutly NO point to this movie, it was pretty entertaining. Its kind of boring the first time you see it, but its better the second time. And its not inappropriate either, we watched it in my 7th grade class. Just to give you a preview, here are some sweet quotes from the movie.""But my lips hurt real bad!""""Tina you fat lard, come get some dinner gosh!""""Its a liger. Its pretty much my favorite animal.""""Do the chickens have large talons?""""I like your sleeves. There real big.""""Are you gonna eat your tots?""""Frekin idiot!!""If this sounds stupid, don't watch the movie. But if it sounds funny, deffinetly watch it!!"
5,HA HA HA HA,"Obviously a love it or hate it type of a movie. I'll tell ya though, I had absolutely NO opinions on this movie whatsoever before I rented it. Actually it looked sort of stupid. I watched it and laughed a handful of times.Well then I waited a couple of days and popped it in again. CRACKED UP. I guess you don't pay as close of attention the first time, but the second time you know what to expect and it's hilarious. I've watched it five times now and it keeps getting funnier.There is a portion of the population with an odd sense of humor. I guess I'm one of them."
5,We need more Napoleons,"Good Ol' Napoleon. Always stays true to himself and friends regardless of the flack he is forced to endure. No major plot to this story, just a few days in the life-The honest, no gimmick, flat-affect responses were refreshingly funny.At the school dance Napoleon asks, completely void of emotion, ""So, are you having a good time?"" Deb responds with a simple unelaborated ""Yes.""There is a Sponge-Bob innocence about this movie which I liked; like, life can be a hassle at times, don't expect more.As a 50+year-old mother of four ""Napoleon Dynamite"" fans, I get to hear fragments of the script over and over, and it always makes me laugh. Tina! Eat the Food!"
4,This movie was hella good,"I liked this movie a lot. The characters were totally pathetic, so pathetic that they were nearly catatonic. It had a lot of really funny lines and situations. As others have noted, not much of a plot, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I knew guys like that in high school and junior high. They smelled funny and this movie really captures the smell. Each scene gradually revealed a little more about the world of degradation and misery that they inhabited. Many scenes portrayed situations so awkward that you could only sit there and cringe. The movie had a lot of style and did a great job of portraying a milleau that may be all too familiar to many."
1,"I watched this movie, so you dont have to.","DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!! YOU MAY HTINK I AM CRAZY BUT I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. I HAVE SEEN BETTER MOVIES IN MY CRAP!!! AFTER WATCHING THIS MOVIE, MY EYES BLED. PEOPLE WHO LIKE THIS MOVIE ARE NERDS WHO CAN RELATE TO THIS MOVIE. IF YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY, FLUSH IT DOWN THE TOILET, BUT DO NOT BY THIS MOVIE. IT IS NOT FUNNY. IT MAKES WATCHING SOMEONE SLEEP SEEM EXITING AND FUNNY. THIS MOVIE SHOULD BE ON A WHYDOYOUTHINK COMMERCIAL. DONT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I DONT WANT TO TOUCH ANYBODY WHO WATCHED THIS MOVIE. THEY PROBRABLY HAVE CRAPPY MOVIE ITIS."
1,SUCKED THE BIG ONE!,"Worst $6.50 i have ever spent in my entire life. i don't know how so many people find humor in this piece of crap. if coming up with junk like Napoleon Dynamite is all you have to do to be a quality moviemaker, maybe i should send in the tape of me and my friends rocking out on inflatable guitars and lip-synching Tenacious D's ""Tribute"", which was playing in the background. i have something to say to everyone who has ever said, ""it's so stupid it's funny"". i'm all for stupid humor, like O Brother Where Art Thou, and Zoolander, but this was just too stupid for me, which is saying a lot. Napoleon is not so nerdy that he's funny. that is just another excuse for laughing at this lame movie because everyone else says it's funny. and for all you ""intellectuals"" who want to justify laughing at this show, don't give me that sh-- about all the subtle humor. there isn't any. don't try to argue, there just isn't."
1,Big Disappointment,I bought this movie without ever seeing it... BIG mistake. This movie sucks so very painfully. All the funny stuff you see in the previews are the only highlights you will see in the whole movie. What's worse is that it takes forever for the scene to get to that lame punchline that when it happens you just get mad because it is such a let down. This movie wasted my $20 gift card and two hours of my life that I will never get back.
1,1 star is being tame,"This was the dumbest hour and a half of my life. I literally fell asleep in the first ten minutes. My friends forced me to watch it but I felt I was losing brain cells watching it. Anyone who waste money on this DVD will live to regret it. I was a waste of time for anyone who helped make this piece of cinema trash. Don't waste your money. Run leave this web page now and get a good movie. May I suggest the witty satire ""Saved""!!!!!!"
1,How is this funny?!,"When I went to see Napoleon Dynamite in theaters, I was expecting it to be hilarious, because everybody at school claims it is. When I watched the movie, I didn't even laugh. No, I don't have a bug up my ass, I just didn't find the movie that funny. I just don't get how some douchebag saying ""You're such a flippin' idiot, gosh"" in a low-strained voice is that hilarious. The disappointment of the movie not being so great was bad enough. Then everybody around school starting quoting the movie constantly, which got really annoying. Sorry folks, but it's not funny when other people quote movies, because it's not original. If you're trying to be outgoing or funny, make original jokes instead of quoting some movie.People have weird senses of humor."
1,Poor taste,"Several friends recommended the movie to me and once I purchased it, I feel asleep 3 times before finishing the movie. It was a very boring movie."
5,"Either you love it, or you hate it - there's no in between!","I was totally impress when I saw Napoleon Dynamite, mostly because of the fact that it is a movie you can sit down and watch with your family and not be embarassed. No nudity, no foul language, nothing to have to explain to the kids - just good humor.When I brought Napoleon Dynamite home, my husband wasn't too sure about seeing it, and in fact, didn't want to watch, but we both laughed all the way through the film.Great story, great soundtrack, great actors."
4,Just For Fun,"Okay, ya, this movie doesn't have a plot. The characters remind me of the less fortunate kids from junior high and Napoleon repeats the word ""idiot"" a lot. But come on you harsh critics out there. It's just a ""freakin"" movie. Lucas or Spielberg didn't create it. This is just a fun movie. The accompanying soundtrack is very good as well. The movie and soundtrack has that 80's vibe to it so maybe that's what I adore so much about it. The 80's were fun and in retrospect so were those geeks back in junior high that everyone made fun of (not that it's right to make fun of geeks). Anyway this movie has sold well and is still selling out at the local movie stores along with the vast number of Napoleon movie collectibles. If you were into the cheesy 80's movies like The Breakfast Club or Weird Science, you'll probably dig this one."
4,Almost a Nerd Documentary,"At some points this movie is almost like a Nerd Documentary. The dialogue is alarmingly on the button. The wide-open country western setting of Preston, Idaho, provides an exhilarating backdrop. For being so hopelessly realistic, the generous ending comes as a pleasant surprise. Can't say I fell in love with the thing (I kept waiting for a story, a critical conflict, or at least one major emotion from one of the principals) but points have to be awarded for originality, and there is a certain moment at that dance where the universal awkwardness of being human just slammed me in the head."
5,"Napolean, go make yourself a quesodilla!","AHHHH! I love this movie! It is so out there and not your normal movie. The actor who plays Napolean is absolutely superb. He has ""mad skills!"" I have to say ... you will either love or hate this movie. There is no in-between. PS Make sure you see the version with the ""new"" ending (it has a wedding!)"
5,A New Hope for Film.,"This film is entertaining and hilarious. But it is also something more...It is able to create a timeless era where sideways ponytails and lanyards are as normal as access to internet chat rooms. The seemingly impossible connection between cultural nuances from the past with contemporary idiosyncracies is marvelous.Also... when was the last time you saw a PG-rated comedy that had no profanity, no obscene sexual references, and no sex/intimate scenes that was hilarious and NOT a children's film? Probably not recently.Characters in this film are made memorable through an excellent script and even better acting. ""Star power"" didn't make each character memorable. I can't think of any leading men or ladies in Hollywood could have done a better job developing these characters on screen.This film has multi-faceted attributes that make it a representation of cinematic genious."
4,ODDBALL BUT JOVIAL AFTER-SCHOOL SPECIAL,"What a colorful and cockeyed title character this film weaves in Napolean Dynamite, with his overbite large glasses, frizzy red hair, tiffs with practically everyone in his school who bugs him, and a daily dose of temper tantrums.It's a Wes Andersen type character study with very little really of a story until about the halfway mark. Instead, we get slice-of-life moments as we watch Napoleon deal with new friendship, girls (especially shy but provocative Deb (Tina Majorino) who has eyes for our hero), bullies, martial arts and dance. Tossed in for good measure are other hilarious characters of his family.Eventually our lovable geek develops into his own and shines on his own terms with a brilliant climatic show stopper. Highly recommended, especially if you've liked films like Rushmore or Tennenbaums."
1,overrated,"I watched this movie because all of my friends said, ""you just have to see Napoleon Dynamite"". So I caved in and watched with a few of my friends. I have to say that this movie didn't even come close to living up to my expectations. In my opinion there were maybe one or two funny bits in the movie, but that's it. And the part that I hated the most was that if you took the scenes that actually had something to do with the plot, this movie would have been about 15 minutes long. The main character was genuinely unlikable and painful to watch. If I had to see this movie again I would probably drop alot of acid first, then I might be able to enjoy it. MAYBE!"
1,Back into time,If I could go back in time and prevent one event...most people would stop 9/11 or do something heroic...I'd stop this movie from
1,the real napoleon was funnier,"yeah, all i really have to say about this movie is that it is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i really wish i could give it 0 stars but that wasn't a possibility. i did not laugh the whole time. only people with sick senses of humor that think they are better than napoleon will even give a slight giggle at this piece of trash."
1,Quite Possibly the Worst Movie Ever!,"I kept hearing great things about this movie from a coworker, so I decided to rent it and check it out. What a mistake this was. The movie has no plot, poor dialogue, made no sense at all, and had the worst soundtrack I have ever heard. Then again, what can you really expect from a movie from MTV. This was a huge waste of time and money, with which I could have purchased an empty box and been much more entertained."
2,Should have been shorter,"This movie really should have just been one of those short movies you see at film fests which are twenty to thirty minutes long. There were a few funny lines here and there and I even chuckle when I think back on some of them (i.e. Kid on Bus-Napolean what are you gonna do today; Napolean- Whatever I feel like I wanna do. Gosh!). However, after forty-five minutes or so the movie just seemed to drag. Like others that have written reviews, I profess to liking offbeat, otherwise dull character driven movies. Nevertheless, I watched the last part of the movie while unloading the dryer. Note-If you too do this make sure not to miss the final dance scene. That is worth checking out."
4,Better than My Mother The Car!,"The problem here is that the audience this movie is aimed at doesn't have the life experience--or the attention span--to get it. And anyone old enough to get it probably won't see it. You might as well show Two Lane Blacktop to people who came to see Two Fast, Two Furious.Still, with a bit of judicious editing, N.D. could have been tailored to the right audience. Napoleon comes home and, tired of being picked on, heads for dad's gun cabinet.Locked 'n loaded, its back to school for some serious detention. Before going down in a hail of bullets Napoleon whacks most of the football team, narrowly missing a cheerleader in a low cut, tight-fitting top and a teacher, in a low cut, tight-fitting top.Soundtrack by Fear Factory; direction by Oliver Stone (who lays down some nonsense about it being a serious commentary on the state of American society). This could be HUGE.Then again, I found it pretty funny just the way it is."
3,It grows on you!,"While I was watching this movie I thought to myself...""Why does everyone love this movie? There is absolutely no point to it!!"" Seriously, no real plot at all. Then the next day I was talking with some friends about the movie. They thought the same thing I did - Why is everyone soooo crazy about this movie? While talking about it we found ourselves quoting movie lines and laughing our butts off. My final verdict - you need to watch this movie with friends and moe than once to get sucked into Napolean's world. But I still have more fun quoting the lines han watching the actual move!"
4,Funnier the longer it's been since I watched it.,"If I had written this review just after watching Napoleon Dynamite, I would have given it 1-1/2 stars (just like Ebert). However, the more time goes by, the funnier and better it gets! The deadpan, no-emotion delivery makes it a bit strange at first, but that is what makes some of the lines SO FRICKEN FUNNY! About the only folks who would find this movie un-funny would be the Summer-and-her-friends people of the world. The rest of us can sit back, relax and Have a Killer Time!The fact that this movie has done so well, WITHOUT VIOLENCE, WITHOUT SEX, WITHOUT FOUL LANGUAGE could send a message to Hollywood....VOTE FOR PEDRO! GOSH!"
4,america's critic,lol is all i can say it may have seemed boring at time but just think of napoleans brother lmao greatly made was crapy at all a must see gosh!!!
5,This Movie Is Just Too Cool For Fools,Napoleon Dynamite is one of the coolest movies to ever slip past the average filmgoer. Each scene is classic and no moment is wasted on filler. My only regret is that it only lasted two weeks in my theater. I can't wait to buy it on DVD.
2,Napoleon Dynamite - 002-4607518-3456042,"This indie favorite follows Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a quirky, ninja-loving teenager growing up in the far reaches of Idaho. Napoleon's life gets complicated when his shady Uncle Rico (John Gries) shows up, a shy girl (Tina Majorino) starts showing him some attention and his best friend Pedro (Efren Ramirez) decides to run for school president. Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2004."
2,Amazing that so many people liked it,With no storyline and hardly any budget. We find a week in the life of a geek. One good thing about this movie is that it does have some good one-liners that made it a movie I was able to watch throughout.
3,This Deadpan Comedy ROCKS!,"What a bizarre treat! The characters are absurdly humorous. Peel away the deadpan nature of the main characters (and the smugness of the ""in-crowd), and you'll find the emotional vulnerability that every teen (and adult) feels. Napoleon's skit is priceless. It's an unexpected treat. Also make sure to watch the finale AFTER the credits run."
1,Boring,"This movie lacks any plot, and there was no humor in it. Also, Napolean is to annoying to watch for two hours."
1,1 star is too generous,"You want me to actually write a review for this disaster? You might laugh if your IQ falls shy of 85, anything over that will make you realize what a dull, retarded, sorry excuse for a movie this is."
1,I have reduced my IQ since I watched this movie,"Plain simple, strait to the point. I feel that I have reduced my IQ since I watched this entire movie hoping it would get better. It never did! Save your money buy or rent something else! Glad I did not buy it!"
1,"""Napoleon Dynamite"" is a bomb.","If you like juvenille humor, high school hijinxs, and sterotypes, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time. You are indeed an IDIOT [a word you hear every 2 minutes] if you plunk down the $21 for this movie."
1,I have no idea why people liked this movie,"I am a movie goer. I love movies. I pride myself on knowing a good movie when I see it. To this end, I have no idea what makes this movie so well loved. I hated it. It was painful. I loved CLOSER, SIDEWAYS, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, GARDEN STATE!!! This one I could live without."
1,My husband is currently watching this film...,"...I'd rather be watching the World Series. On Fox. How desperate am I?Gave it 15 minutes, and I wanted to shoot the kid. And I support gun control.Help me. Please."
5,FOLLOW YOUR HEART,"sweeet! for the nerd in all of us. captures the awkwardness and pain of high school perfectly. I'm sure almost everyone can identify with napoleon's isolation and loneliness, we've all felt it at some time in our lives. napoleon is able to fulfill the hope and dream we all had in our teen age years of acceptance by our peers [well, most of them anyway]. I loved all the quirky characters, especially uncle rico. if you ever felt like an outcast [I did] when you were young this is the movie for you. sure to have a large cult following. tender hearted with a sweet [there's that word again] ending. probably too weird for everyone's taste. be sure to watch all of the credits because there is more movie to follow."
5,A Great Cult Classic Made Even Better,The DVD version of this cult classic already had great clarity but this Blu-Ray version is outstanding.The picture of this version gives the movie the extra punch needed on a large screen. The documentary on the disc is icing on the cake but I don't think anyone would want to view it more than once. It would have been better if interviews with actors were included.
5,Flying High,"I watched Napoleon Dynamite for the first time on a plane. Not expecting much from inflight movies, I wondered what I had stumbled onto. Within moments I was cracking up with laughter, thinking "" you gotta be kidding "". A passenger seated next to me (who appeared to be quite conservative) also started to let out spontaneous fits of laughter. So there we were snug in cattle class seats with headphones on wiping consious tears from our faces and trying to stop ourselves from breaking into uncontollable asylum entrance laughter."
1,"I LOVE this movie, but hate the studio practice...","of double (and more) dipping. What's next, ND-The Director's Cut??"
3,It makes NO sense!,"Hi. My family rented this movie last night to watch. And... hello! What the heck is the point of this? Almost eveyone in my class says this movie is hilarious. This is what my class was talking about? This is the funniest movie ever? No way! There are a ton of movies that are funnier than this. So what, Napoleon lives with his grandparents and brother and has a llama? So what if his idiotic Mexican friend Pedro wants to be class president? (now i understand why he wears the shirt that says ""vote for pedro"") This movie is about a nonsense idiot who has no goals in his life, has horrible friends, and lives with his grandparents. I also rented Yours, Mine, and Ours, and it was much funnier and made more sense. So, if anybody actually enjoys this movie, don't talk to me. I hope this was helpful.*****************************PEACE EVERYWHERE*******************"
1,Proof that movie companies pay people for positive reviews.,"There is no way on God's green Earth anyone with a brain could give this movie a positive review unless they are being paid to do so. Even a stupid movie like ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" could have some redeeming qualities, or a rediculous movie like ""Airplane!"" could provide laughs. But ""Napoleon Dynamite"" has no value whatsoever except to trick some confused people into thinking that it has some value. In any case, I am convinced that the creators of this garbage knew exactly what they were doing. There is a scene where Napolean is watching his uncle's home movie of his uncle posing with a football. Napolean laments watching it and calls it the worst movie ever made. I believe that was exactly the intention the producers of ""Napolean Dynamite"" were aiming for, and they succeeded."
4,"Give it a chance, it's ""pretty nice""","When I first saw the previews for this movie I was not interested in seeing it at all. My friend, however, saw it in the theatres and insisted it was hilarious and made me and a few of my other friends go see it. She was cracking up the entire time, while the 4 of us were sitting there slightly chuckling once in a while, but mainly glaring at her for making us waste an hour and a half of our time and the money for the ticket. After we saw it though, we started randomly quoting the movie to the point where we did it so much that we wanted to see it again. The second time around it was definitely a lot more funny. I guess this is the kind of movie that slowly grows on you if you don't love it at first. Now all of us love the movie, have a copy of it, and still quote it. It's flippin sweet!"
1,Terrible Movie,"Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy. I would agree that this film is comical, but it is comical for the wrong reasons.The main reason that it is funny is because it is so uneventful. When I asked my mom about how she liked the movie she said, ""It was so boring that I don't even remember what happened. All I remember is a weird boy with strange hair."" Also, while watching the movie with 3 other friends, two of them fell asleep.This movie is not worth buying let alone watching it. I do not recommend it for any moviegoers."
1,Snore Fest Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have seen, I can not understand how so many people liked this movie. This movie just fell flat in so many ways and was so slow paced, the character were unlikable, the humor was dry as the Mohave desert. Don't get me wrong I do like some dry humor like The Monty Python movies but Napoleon Dynamite was beyond dry. There were maybe 2 funny parts I can count in the whole movie. But don't take my word for it, give a chance and go ahead and rent it. You might like it but for me it was a waste of time and a rental fee."
1,DORKFEST 2005! (0 STARS!),"This is without a doubt, the dorkiest, gayest, stupidestpiece of garbage, EVER put on film! I like stupid comedys,but this isn't a comedy, it's just stupid! WORTHLESS!!!!"
1,PLEASE READ THIS TO SAVE YOUR MONEY,"IT IS CUSTOMARY FOR INTELLECTUAL TYPES TO TELL YOU HOW GOOD A MOVIE LIKE THIS IS. HOWEVER, IT TAKES A WORKING MAN WHO WORKS HARD FOR HIS MONEY TO REALLY TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT A MOVIE THAT COST MONEY TO SEE! IT IS FOR THAT REASON THAT I, WHO WORK FOR A LIVING AND WANT VALUE FOR MY MONEY WILL TELL YOU THE TRUTH ABOUT THIS MOVIE. AFTER EXPENDING(...)TO BUY THIS MOVIE I FEEL VIOLATED, napolion dynamite IS A BAD MOVIE. IT HAS THE MOST DISLIKABLE CARACTERS EVER AND IT WAS NOT WELL THOUGHT-OUT. IT IS REALLY A PIECE OF JUNK WITH A FEW GAGS. RENT IT FIRST BEFORE BUYING IT AND THEN YOU WILL FEEL BAD ABOUT EXPENDING(...)."
1,trash.,"Plain and simply, this is the most boring movie anyone will ever watch this year. I am a huge fan of indie films and find them much more entertaining than the big blockbuster dramas and crappy comedies with juvenile humour in them, but this one just plain--excuse the blunt word--sucked. The main character will make you want to kill him in the most gruesome of ways because he is not only a complete and utter loser, but he is also a complete jerk who is negative all the time. It was truly painful to watch this film because I was getting depressed at how stupid this character could be. The uncle sounds like a pedophile at all times, and the mexican kid (though orignal idea) sounds like he's drugged up on way too many sedatives. This is the biggest letdown for me in cinema history and i find that my friends get annoyed with me after i tell them how bad i thought this film was. Trash. absolute trash. don't buy it, don't rent it, hell dont even see it for free."
2,Dissappointing,"After hearing a lot of hype about this movie, I had to see it and I did not like it. It is a dull comedy with jokes that aren't really that funny. The main character is a dork who really does nothing but draw mythical creatures. He makes 2 friends, a shy girl and a Mexican who barely talks english. Him and the mexican try to get dates for a dance and then run against the popular girl in school for class president. After a funny, and very good dance (the funniest part in the movie) by Napoleon the school loves it, but they never shows if they won or not. Napoleon then at the end starts to date the shy girl and his dorky brother who meets a sexy black woman on the internet gets married to her after she has him dressing like a gangsta and the movie ends. No real point to the movie and I'd avoid it."
2,"Oh, Gosh","We recieved a tip from a fan that this movie was really good, so we rented it.WHAT?!?!?It seemed like it was written by people suffering from A.D.D. It doesn't follow at all. Even if you can figure out where the story is going, it's hardly worth the trip.Jon Heder is funny, but I found it thoroughly unamusing (not to mention disgusting) to watch him shoving ""tots"" into his mouth, pocket, locker, or anywhere else he can think of.Seriously, if you want a comedy that is at least standable to watch, see Nacho Libre."
2,annoying,"A petrifingly bitter and grotesque desprate gambit, that not only tries too hard to make us laugh,(which it failed in)it also makes us hate the characters, because the're massively annoying.From Napoleon's scratchy, overly depressed, moany racket of a voice, to Pedro's( I got the names stuck in my head) moronic hobble, they challenge you to think: Did the director incarcerate these extra terrestrials of characters to decimate the audience and the critics, or was it an evil plot to reroute the entertainment center as we know it.One thing it does manage to do however, is it managed to stay clean throughout the whole film. Did it help? Not really, I'm sad to say. I wish it was good, and I wanted to laugh, but all it managed to do was be annoying, it bit at my nerves. I'm sick of it!"
1,Torture to sit through,This is quite simply one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. What is all the fuss about? It's one of those movies that you continue to watch hoping that the 65 minutes you have already invested will reveal some hilarious 'splash' ending. It never comes. Lame.
1,This film sucked Terribly!,"I went to see this film when it came to my local theater. From the reviews I figured this would be like revenge of the nerds. What I got was the [...] film I have seen in my entire life.I normally would like this type movie. I loved all four Revenge of the Nerds films, but this was in my opinion a complete bomb. From the opening credits all the way to about twenty minutes from the end of the movie the movie sucked it didn't get better until about twenty minutes from the end when the major plot portion of the film finally was brought into view. The rest of the movie was [...]I am a person who typically likes almost any movie but this film was terrible. [...] Don't waste your hard earned money on this [...]!"
1,Is this for real?,"Napoleon Dynamite- where to start. Let us start with the plot: There is none. None whatsoever. And whoever plays Napolean: unforgetable, but in a good way? Not so much. I was drug to see this against my will, and it was a thousand times worse than I ever expected. It seems that I am the only one on this planet that doesn't find the expressions ""Tina, you fat lard..."" and ""Your mom goes to college"" mind numbingly hilarious."
1,Pure Garbage,To say this movie is a steaming pile of utter horse crap would be an insult to excrement the world over.Spare yourself the pain.
1,is there such thing as a -5 star?,"all the reviewers who think this is the worst movie they've ever seen are right. this is the worst movie I ever saw. I saw it free and still want my money back!nothing funny. nothing redeeming. if anyone thought this movie was good simply has a screw loose.Attack of the Killer Tomatoes was better than this....an update after about a year.although I never saw this movie ever again it seems to have a cult following. no, it doesnt even come close to the unforgettable Fast Times at Ridgemont High but i find several lines like ""Idiot"", ""Gosh"", and ""My lips hurt real bad"" being used around the house. The funniest thing about this movie is when John Heder hosted Saturday Night Live and told the story of the inspiration for Napolean coming from several people but not his good friend from college ""Leopold Samsonite"", nor is sidekick ""Jose"".I would still fall asleep during this movie if it played again, but there are a few lines that seem to stick with you for a while."
4,A movie U can watch anytime it's on tv,"The first time I saw this, I wouldn't have rated it. I didn't really get the hype. Then I started watching bits and pieces as I would catch it on tv. I rewatched it and Lol and totally love it! Now, any time it is on tv I will start watching. This kid never gives up, just pushes through the whole movie in the same monatone manner. You give him kudos for not killing himself(figur of speech)!"
5,Super funny,This is one of the funniest movies of all time...couldn't find it anywhere but Amazon had it! Thanks
1,"PLEASE! Not remotely funny, total waste.","Reviews for this film are overwhelmingly positive. The people that recommended this to me were sure it's great. NO WAY.This movie isn't even a movie - I have to say that it was slightly worse than Red Zone Cuba but slightly better than Manos: The Hands of Fate in terms of plot, jokes, and action. (Both films are MST3k fodder; I am referring to the non-MST treated originals - obviously, the MST treatment turns these into comedy classics and invalidates this comparison.)Basically, this movie is about as far from Three O'clock High (possibly the best down/out teen nerd comedy in this vein - i.e, dry as opposed to the superb Better Off Dead's more wacky approach) as one can get.Avoid this movie. Be productive. Don't lose 7.3 hours of your life agonizing through this one. No, it's not really 7.3 hours long, but it feels like it.ZERO STARS. UGH."
1,Very Overrated,"I noticed this movie had so much hype. I am in agreement with Ebert's review, although I think this movie was worse than Ebert's rendiditon. I watched the whole movie through, and I have to say, I did not have one single laugh. I thought this movie was not at the very least funny. Unfortunately me and my friends did not share the same type of humour this movie apparently has.Absolutely aweful."
2,Dude this movie is stupid,"Whats so good about this movie, its so stupid, no plot, no direction, nothing, alot of peaple where i live hate this movie and wondering why some peaple like this, this movie is GAY!!"
1,Please no more of this,"As a person who was a child of the late 70s and early 80s, I'm seriously getting sick of the use of nostalgia to generate ""buzz"" in current pop culture entertainment.The same goes for this movie.Supposedly this film is set in present day, but the backdrop is right out of the early '80s. Napoleon's brother uses a computer which looks like an original Apple, yet he is chatting with babes on the Internet. That scene and many others like it are par for the course here.Yeah, I realize this film is absurb and I realize it asks you to suspend reality. Yet, it tries so hard to be a genuine reflection of high school life.If being a mean and hateful person - along with consistently lying - was part of your high school experience, well I guess this movie fits you to a T."
2,Most overhyped overrated movie since the Blair Witch Project,"If you have read the hype and breathless reviews before seeing this movie, you will be disappointed.It's just not that great, nor is it that interesting. The bandwagon jumping is more amusing to watch than this movie is."
2,Movies budget went to pot.,"How ever much money it cost to make this movie you can bet that 3/4 of that budget went to buy pot to keep the lead characters stoned out of their minds.I was surprised they didn't drool on them selves, although I'm sure they did at some point, maybe if they ever release out-takes you'll see it. Couple of funny parts sprinkled in to a story that seemed to have been made up as they went along. To be honest with you I think I laughed at parts that weren't meant to be laughed at.I was pretty let down with this movie after all the hype. I guess if you are still in Junior High it might have been hilarious. But over all I feel it was a wasted 2 hours of my life. But what else would one expect from brain-dead MTV?"
5,"This film is many things, but plotless and boring? NO.","Picture your most awkward moments magnified. Then take out the perspective you have on those moments-- you don't see how uncomfortable they are. What can you do but love these characters?I never found their treatment to be condescending or pitiful. Uncomfortable sometimes, but not as uncomfortable as, say, a lot of Michael Moore moments. These characters have good hearts, and the film promotes an appreciation for that above appearances and social graces.Boring? I couldn't take my eyes off it. Sometimes because it was like a train wreck, sometimes because the teen plot moments caught me up. With a 4 star average on over 500 reviews, it's worth a look."
4,Funny movie,"I'd heard mixed things about Napoleon Dynamite, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be good? Would it be bad? Well, when I watched it, I liked it, so it was good! The characters are unique and funny, as is the plot. And it is a movie that is quite quotable, which is a good thing! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,It was good for the first few times but it started to suck!,"After awhile I started not to watch it because it's just a story about three losers who have no life and one tries to get the girl and run for president. It's still the same high school movie like they show in any other high school flicks. Sure I laughed hard for the first time I saw it and I thought it was hilarious but then I started to feel sorry for poor Napolean not having any friends and not getting a girl. Napolean really reminded me of Butt-head in a way with the same hairstyle, features, and the same accent. Napolean's accent is really funny though but the movie started to get annoying and I sold my DVD back. That's all what I have to say."
2,AHH!,"I have to say this movie was the worst movie I had ever seen or second to worst.Yeah it was sort of funny,but it had no plot.If you watch it you`ll be stupider."

Nominated for a Grand Jury Prize at Sundance in 2004."
2,Cute but goes nowhere!,"Jon Heder as Napolean is dry, low key, and funny for 5 minutes. If only he had a script and a director to work with he could have been funny for the remaining time of the movie. The first half is cute because of all the quirky supporting characters (brother Kip, Uncle Rico...)but the second half is stupid because there's hardly any plot developement and literally no ending! It's just people moving around, doing dumb things, and Napoleon saying, ""Freakin' Idiot!"" for the last 30 minutes."
2,Over-Rated,"I was told by some of my friends that this movie was hilarious. So i watched it. I sat there for almost the whole movie, waiting for something to happen. It does have its funny parts. but the whole movie is just slow, and nothing really happens. i don't know how anyone can say this movie is all that great. i gave it two stars, because it did have some good parts in it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Overated,"Ok so the movie made me laugh in a few occasions, but overall I felt this movie was kind of boring. I guess I don't understand this type of comedy, but I went to see it anyway because almost everyone in my school was telling me about how funny this movie was. SO I saw and I almost fell asleep halfway though. This movie is really stupid. The only ocasions when I laughed was when Pedro was talking, I thought he was kind of funny. So definitely this movie is overrated."
5,"NOT ""The worst movie ever""","It is obvious the people who do not like this movie are the uncreative ones. Have you noticed they all say the exact same thing? ""This is the worst movie ever!"" There's no way they could possibly know that ;-)"

1,Baby's First Deadpan Comedy,"The actors look as uninterested in this as I was watching it. Really I'm probably putting more effort into this review than the film makers went into writing this junk.I think the appeal to this film though is when people say some 'in' joke, the 'cool' kids started liking this so the lemmings in grade school followed suit going ""HAHAHA, LIGER! I GET IT! DO YOU GET IT!? BECAUSE I DO""! Some films have a quirky charm to them such as Little Miss Sunshine or Lost in Translation, but this whole movie is nothing but spouting off random non-sequitors that somehow stick with high school kids who's senses of humor is still underdeveloped.I can see years from now those kids going through their DVD collections and fishing out Napolean Dynamite and muttering to themselves ""I can't believe I watched this crap""."
4,Funny and prity good!,Yeah this movie is sweeeeaaatttttt. It could have a bit more better plot but it's funny. really I have nothing else to say. Rent this movie it's funny!
1,Wish I could give it zero stars and get those minutes of my life back,"Godawful, unwatchable, un-funny, and just plain yucky. I don't think filmmakers can guarantee their cleverness will come across to viewers. In this case, any cleverness failed to find its way to me. The characters are unlikeable and don't seem to like themselves or each other. Animals are treated cruelly in a gratuitous attempt to make humor out of nothing amusing.When I think of yucky films that work anyway, ones amused and entertained me, I think of John Waters' ""Pink Flamingoes"" & ""Female Troubles"" and Pedro Almadovar's ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" & ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down."" ""Napoleon Dynamite"" does not even merit mention in the same paragraph as those films, except as an example of what DOESN'T work."
2,Non dynamite,"This movies for all its hype was a waste of money, I am surprised it won awards, but I guess it is a hype driven market, don't waste your money , I did!!"
4,"""What the flip is grandma doing at the sand dunes . . . GOSH!""","The funniest movie ever made. If your feeling down, this movie will pick you right up. Jon Heder is hilarious. Not only a must see, but a must own movie. O yeah . . . VOTE 4 PEDRO!!"
3,Interesting,"I'll be honest. I watched this movie a couple weeks back and still can't decide what to make of it. It is such a different type of movie that you can't really place it in a certain category of movies. It's almost like watch a funny documentary about an event which you know nothing about. Being a college student I had been subjected to hearing a lot of quotes from this movie. I had to watch it out of survival. Now people are telling me that you really don't get it until you watch it a second time. I'm not sure if I'm ready for that step yet. Actually I'm not really sure that there is really anything to get. I will probably try and find out. I wouldn't advise buying this movie. Most people have seen it and I don't think it is one you will want to watch all that frequently. My advice is to rent or buy it used after all the movie stores get rid of their hundreds of ""guaranteed in stock"" copies."
5,Artistically stunning rendition of a classic story,"More than thirty-five years ago, I remember my mother reading this story to me. The sing-song rhyming lullaby peppered with unfamiliar words ""what's a runcible spoon, mommy?"" made this a favorite. I bought the edition illustrated by Jan Brett back in 1997 when my oldest child was a toddler. Since then, it's gone through two more children... they have all treasured it. The words are familiar, flowing, graceful. The artwork is stunning. Before my children were patient enough to just listen to words, they pointed out the orange fish, the starfish, the swordfish, the boat, bananas, a necklace, a guitar.... and on and on. I've bought this book no less than 10 times as gifts over the years and would recommend it to anyone. Superb."""
5,Beautiful book,"This is a lovely rendition of the poem - evokes beautiful peaceful feelings through the illustrations, and yet the complexities of the drawings involve so many different aspects. Children can find on each page similar fish, and other sea life as well as the special 'looking for' the little seahorse which is on every page. The scenes are active, involved, and peaceful at the same time - you find yourself able to sit on one page and discuss many things on it, or just enjoy it, for a long time. My 2- 1/2 yr old first got this from the libary and we had it for months, and then we bought it and she still loves it. Yet the board version I would purchase even if she were older! (I even had wanted this for my birthday!)Love it!"
5,Love it!,"Beautiful, wonderful, special. Our 18 month old baby loves it. The poem is a classic which I grew up with and the illustration adds to an already perfect little tale."
3,Alright,"It's about a boy who wants to join this frat club in his high school, to do so he must complete challanges. One of the challenges is to get a girl to fall in love and have sex with him in a span of three weeks. The girl is a one who is not very attractive and at first Ian, the boy who has to complete the challenge, doesn't like her and think the challenge is annoying. Then as he starts to talk to her and hang with her Ian's affections grow. The girl, Kylie, likes Ian and is surprised by a guy having any intrest in her, but unfortunatley has no clue that Ian is dating her because of a challenge. Ian has a choice to make at the end, either join the frat club and complete the challenge, or stay with Kylie a girl whose affections on him has grown."
4,"sexy,scandalous, sweet","This is a good book. Seeing as I had already read Jason and Kyra I was looking for the story to take on the same aire and was almost disappointed when it didn't. However, I realized that this is not the same story and shouldn't be, but it is definitely well told and full of drama surprises and adorable moments. My only regret is that more time was not spent in focusing on the characters after Ian Striver chose between his friends or his girl Kylie. This is a very good read. Highly recommended."
5,Awesome...,This book was a random pickup for me. But I actually enjoyed it more than I thought! Ian was a mess!
5,EXCELLENT READ!!!,"THIS BOOK WAS AN EXCELLENT READ!!!! I JUST FINISHED THIS BOOK YESTURDAY AND I CANNOT STOP THINKING ABOUT IT. SHE MUST WRITE A SEQUEL! IF YOU BUY THIS BOOK, TRUST ME, ITS NOT A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!! A STRONG RECOMMENDATION ON MY HALF"
3,Buy an 8lb bag of coffee before you dive in,"Well, keeping in line with the AJAX in Action book I just read, this thing is a real cure for the insomniac. The authors of these books manage to drain every last bit of excitement out of even the latest of technologies. However, the topics do get covered if you can manage to keep your eyes awake. Through-out the read I often found myself rereading entire chapters because I just end up loosing interest. Also, it is written in such a manner that it begins to dig deeper into topics without first providing a strong foundation of the basics. For example, the first four chapters are using intercepts all through the code, however the reader still has very little or no idea what an intercept actually is. Examples are spread too far apart and sometimes there are no code examples to drive home a point. This will be my last In Action book purchase."
4,A great study guild,"I found this book to be helpful in certain areas of my study. I did disagree with a few information printed inside of this book, however over all it was a useful tool."
3,MADDENING!,"This is a maddening book! Fantastic story, written in 1941 and so right for the time, but the this book seems to have been updated in 1960 when it makes no sense!!!???? Talks about TV but a cab ride is a quarter, Movie studio producers make 250 dollars a week???!!!!I don't know if it was just a screenplay in 1941 and Fisher than put it in novel form around 1960 or what, but very hard to read. If it doesn't bother you, read it. Great story, though."
1,DVD Atlantic convoys,VERY disappointed as this is not a bad dvd but I purchesed it through Amazon under a different name ! and as you know no refund!!!!!
5,One of the best works on healing out there,This book actually delivers what it says it will with actual approaches to healing yourself and others. Jan Holland puts the information together in a logical and easy to read way that allows one to use the information in a very practical and applied way. I have used it to recover from a series of small strokes in my late thirties and to make needed changes in my life. I went from a very weak left leg to full use again. I am went from difficulty spelling simple words to A's in my Ph.D. program. His techniques are also incredibly valuable in dealing with difficult emotional pain and healing from that.I had bought a copy of the book several years ago and loaned it out. I am buying it again and want more copies to share with my father and friends. I truly hope this book stays in print as it is so valuable.
3,"Not bad, especially for those converting from PC to Mac","Lots of good tips to get you started. Accurate and easy to follow. However, if you were as excited as I was to get your new iMac, chances are you figured out much of what this book has to offer during the time it took for Amazon to ship it. I found the Apple Training Series library to be more what I had in mind. Those books have color pics, and are better in a tutorial/training sense. But they're at least double the price. Am I glad I bought the Mac for Dummies anyway? Yes. Money well spent. Good luck. And CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING A MAC!"
4,good voiume for the beginner in iMac,An excellent book for the beginner in the use of Macs. Language is clear and avoids the use of computer jargon. Not too detailed so as to lose the beginner in the intricacies of computer operation.
2,"Macs for Dummies, you have to be REALLY Dumb....","Although Macs for Dummies isn't extremely helpful, learning Leopard for Dummies is extremely helpful both as a read cover to cover and a reference."
4,"Great product, one tiny issue.","Ok, my one petty issue:As other reviewers have said, adjusting the thickness of the slice is a matter of angling the slicer. Which is an inconvenience, and a feature that's regularly found in other cheese slicers, which is why I've docked a star.Aside from that, this is a great slicer. Easy to swap the wire, too sturdy for my numbskull roommate to break (like he did the last slicer). All in all, a great product, and I'd buy it again. I only mention my little issue because it may be a greater inconvenience/dealbreaker for some, but I've been able to work around it."
2,Lasted One Year,"This is the only Oxo product I have been disappointed with. They are one of my favorite kitchen ware suppliers. This cheese slices broke after only 1 year. The plastic tightening wheel split in half. We never dropped it, never put it in the dishwasher....it has only ever been used to cut soft cheeses like Havarti.Can't recommend this item."
3,Works great while it lasts...,"We figured that spending a little more on a slicer would mean we'd have something that lasted a lot longer than our first cheapo one did (which lasted about 5 years). Not so, at least in this case. I've been generally pleased with OXO products, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It does work great, and I love that it comes with the extra wires, but we didn't even have a chance to use the extra wires as the little wheel for tightening the wires is plastic and broke easily (we've had it less than 6 months). Now I'm left trying to decide if we should just get another cheapo one to last us 5 years, or try another more expensive slicer and hope that one is worth it..."
2,Wheel broke but before that I loved it.,"I really liked this product before the wheel broke. Not sure why the wheel broke. I wasn't doing anything out of the ordinary. I did put it in the dishwasher. But it's supposedly dishwasher safe. I agree with another comment that if the wheel were not plastic, the slicer may last longer. But I was VERY disappointed when it broke. I'm hoping OXO will send me a replacement. Either way I will be buying another more durable cheese slicer from another manufacturer."
1,Great...in theroy,"For some reason, the wires on our cheese slicers break with regularity; every few years we find ourselves in need of a new one. So, this seemed like the perfect solution...a slicer with replaceable wires! Notsomuch. In theory it's a great idea; however, in reality it doesn't work so well. Placement of the wire is easy as is adjustment of the tensioner; however, I find that the wire is constantly slipping off of the top of the slicer thereby rendering it useless. I have tried putting it back on and tightening it, but it still keeps slipping off. There are little grooves in the top that the wire is supposed to sit in, but they don't seem to do their job very well. Guess I'm going to have to go back to getting a new cheese slicer every few years."
1,Wire adjuster stripped itself out in a month,"I bought this product hoping the extra wires would save me money.Unfortunately the tension adjuster and wire ends are both plastic and the tensioner's threads stripped out in a month making the cheese slicer and the wires completely useless.Maybe the cheese I like to slice is too hard (Tillamook medium cheddar) but I expected this slicer to last at least a year on its replacement wires, not a month."
2,"Worked great for 6 months, then died.",The little black thing that tightens the wire is plastic and just broke off for no apparent reason so the wire just falls off. It's garbage.
1,Beware the thumb wheel.,"This would be the perfect cheese slicer if it weren't for the plastic thumb wheel. As noted by several other posters, the thumb wheel is plastic and up until the time it disintegrated in our hands, we thought we'd never go looking for another cheese slicer again. The thing is, we hardly ever used the thumb wheel. We pretty much left it alone and it still broke all apart. Sure hope OXO comes up with a better wheel because I'll be the first in line."
1,Interesting design but badly flawed,"Oxo generally makes great products, but every so often they come up with a dud. This is one of the duds. The problem is in the tensioning mechanism, which consists of a spiral gear that engages a toothed track molded into the end of the slicing wire. Turning the spiral gear with your thumb moves the track and tightens the wire. Unfortunately, the gear is made from plastic and is prone to break. When the first slicer we bought broke I thought it might be a fluke, given Oxo's good reputation. Now that the second one has broken in the same way, I'm concluding that it's a bad design. If Oxo ever replaces the plastic thumbwheel with a metal one this product might be great, but until that time I'd stay away."
2,Thumb Tightening Wheel Stripped,"We've had this product for a couple of years. I went to tighten the wire using the thumb wheel and it kept slipping in the wheel. Thought it must be the wire, so went and got a new wire and tried to tighten the new one. Nope. Looked into the middle of the wheel with a flashlight and it appears that the threads have worn down or stripped. Don't see an option to replace the wheel, so out in the trash it goes."
2,good slicer poor quality,"I have purchased two of these slicers. Each lasted about a month. In both cases the adjusting wheel broke off. After the first one broke, I contacted Oxo. They told me to ship them the defective slicer for replacement. Not worth the effort and expense for an inexpensive item. My husband convinced me to buy a second one with the idea that we still had the extra wires and the slicer really worked very well, maybe we just got a faulty product. $26.00 and 2 cheese slicers later I am willing to admit this is a lemon and the search for a decent slicer continues."
1,Not very good. The wire tightening knob broke,"About a month ago or more the plastic knob that tightens the wire broke. It will not work without a wire that is tight. Thank you, Yvonne Haeffner 406 563-7857"
1,"not good, piece of junk",the wire cutter comes off every time I use it I will return it I would not recommend this product not worth the price
1,Update,"The one I just bought (June, 2012) had the same defect with the wheel - cheap plastic and stripped gears. OXO replaced the slicer, and the wires ripped out of the anchor on this one last night. Good thing it has extra wires.This gets one star because I can not offer zero through Amazon."
2,Nice idea but not well made,"When our old slicer broke we went out to buy a new one and came across this. We liked the easy grip handle and the fact that you could replace the wire (that's what broke on ours). However, the wire is constantly coming loose and slipping off the track. So between every other slice you have to adjust the wire back into it's spot. It hasn't broken on us but the inconvenience of it has us looking for a new cheese slicer."
2,Won't last a life time--not even close,Handle broke 2-3 years after got it. Metal part detached from plastic. Grr. Thought it would last a while with the extra wires but I never got to use them.
1,Junk!,"I've had two of these and both have broken with minimal use! The plastic, tension-adjusting wheel has cracked making the entire thing unusable. Oxo has replaced these for me before, but I'm done! Time to find something else to cut the cheese... :)"
4,Too bad there is not a non-rusting 'DeLuxe' model available,"I bought a pair for my wife (she keeps hitting a hard-to-see stone wall in our drive-- bums her out more than me :-) You get what you pay here, they have started to rust after one month. I used Loc-tite on the screws, and really cranked them down (to point of burrowing into plastic of fender on one), so they have not fallen off like other reviewer.My wife proceeded to scrape rear bumper of car on first trip after I installed pair on front and mid-front, so I am buying another pair for rear and mid-rear. She really likes them, they have saved her several times already.She claims the feelers gets a lot of male attention on road. Lots of guys staring at car, she thinks its weird they don't look up to figure out who is driving such a vehicle. (That's what she claims.) You've been warned!"
1,review,"the item was easy to attach, however , it did not stay attached the screw and nut could not stay tawt, therefore came loose in transit which resulted in the loss of said items on the road."
2,Curb fellers not for modern automobiles.,These are old fashioned curb feelers that no doubt are good for older cars with metal bodies/fenders.The newer cars with composite materials are not rigid enough to hold the feelers firm..
4,Gets plently of stares but works fine,"Curb feelers used to be very commom in the 50's or so, with their main purpose to protect white wall tires from rubbing against the curb. They are used bery rarely now and I am often asked what the wires are for. These look and work fine."
1,not pleased,Item broke first trip i made to a car show. traveled only 45 miles when i returned home fingers where broken off.
5,Melancholia,"Whats wonderful about the fiction of Thomas Cook is the coexistence of the unabashadly sentimental and romantic, with the restrained sensationalism of the grisly crimes that propel the story. This work, however could never be classified as Romantic Suspense.Cook is in a class by himself no matter how romantic (it is) or suspenseful(it is ) . Cook's elegaic language and his clear, sheer respect for his characters and their lives will leave you unashamedly weeping at its terrific conclusion."
4,A Good Mystery Novel,"This novel, set in the early 20th century, deals with love and murder. The narrator, Calvin Chase, is obsessed with his brother's death and with finding Dora March, who fled the scene after her brother dies inside her house. He is certain that she killed Billy and sets about solving the case himself. Most of the story focuses on the past, before Billy meets Dora and the events which lead up to his death.The only time I got confused was in the last few chapers, where the past and the present collide. I had to read it slowly in order to absorb everything that was going on. Places in the Dark isn't just a murder mystery. It involves two brothers, both obsessed with a mysterious woman. The murder resolution turned out to be quite different than I expected, one which didn't fit with the ominous tone of the story. I guess that's why I gave it four stars instead of five."
1,the same old thing from Cook,"Cook's last four or five books have been entirely alike. ""Places in the Dark"" is the same pseudo-poetic bilge he's been shelling out all during the 1990s. Same book, different cover. A bitter disappointment, because he used to be good."
5,Great Product,"My employees use one of these creepers everyday, the first one we purchased lasted over 6 years, I consider that pretty good for the use it gets."
4,To understand animals is to understand yourself,"Paul Shepard's book, The Others: how animals made us human, is a thoughtful analysis of how animals played a role in determining who and what we are as human animals. As in discussions of religion and politics, you will not agree with everything Professor Shepard writes. However, you will agree that he has developed a credible case that you cannot understand people, whether 10,000 years ago or today, without a better understanding of how Homo erectus and Homo sapiens interacted with both food and predatory animals 100,000 or 1,000,000 years ago. It will make you think, and that, not manipulation, is Professor Shepard's goal."
4,"Dense, but highly effective","Paul Shepard will probably be viewed as one of the more important philosophers of nature in the future. He more or less created the field of human ecology and his books have had a major influence on the environmental movement. All of his books are worth reading and are recommended. However Shepard is not to be taken lightly. His work is dense, at times difficult, and will shake up your thinking. From his first major work, ""Man in the landscape,"" to the end of his life he threw off ideas like a grinding stone throwing off sparks. If you are really serious about the idea that human evolutionary history is important to our current lives then Paul Shepard is for you. If you are looking for a light read about animals, I'd look elsewhere."
4,My kids love it,"I bought this for my daughter who is 13 years old. She and her freinds have had a great time playing. My son, who is 17, also has been playing. It was a great gift"
5,well worth the money,bought this for our son for christmas and it is well worth the money we spent. he has played with it countless times so far. he even invites his friends over and they have contests to see who is best...great gift.
5,Excellent,Guitar Hero III is one of the best games I have ever played. It features great songs and it can be very challenging. I play guitar and in some of the higher difficulties it could be pretty hard. It is great for the whole family and I would recommend it.
3,Wireless Controller Sucks! Never order from Red Octane's site!!,"First of all, the game itself is not as good as the previous GH games. I don't like the look of the new screen. The star power meter is not as easy to see and the words flashing ""50 note streak"", ""100 note streak"" are very distracting. But most of all, the Kramer wireless controller is awful! It looks cool, but doesn't work half the time. It is much slower than a corded controller and not all the buttons always work leading to lots of mess-ups and poor scores. When I first got mine the red button didn't work, however it magically started working but now the green button occasoinally goes out. I tried to send it back but RED OCTANE has been Very Very slow to respond to my requests, I will NEVER order anything from them again. Their customer service is HORRIBLE!!"
5,Very Cool Game,"Guitar Hero 3 is a great game. All the songs are sweet! The best part about the game are the battles. If you love the second Guitar Hero, you love this one. One of the songs called ""Through the Fire and Flames"" is a real challenge on expert. So as ""Raining Blood""."
2,"Fun, if it worked!","I think guitar hero is a great game. I think it is interactive and gets the player out of his or her seat. I think it enhances a person's hand-eye coordination. I also believe guitar hero is a great group game, much like the Wii is. Guitar Hero is good for any age group. And Guitar Hero III especially has some GREAT songs and artists. I give this game 5 stars, but this package and it's wireless guitar are terrible. I only had this guitar and receiever for 3 days and it suddenly stopped working. I've had to wait 3 weeks for a replacement. I do NOT recommend the wireless components. PS2 isn't ready for that yet, obviously."
2,Guitar Hero 3 letdown,"The game itself is great, they have really outdone themselves on that. However, I was very let down by the controller which was the reason why I had to send the product back twice and ultimately decided that the game is what I really wanted. No time for messing around with a controller that doesn't work really well or at all.I was really let down that the description doesn't match the product (the guitar is not a Les Paul replica, it's a Kramer); and they really dropped the ball on perfecting it before it was shipped to stores."
5,excelente juego,muy buen producto se adapta a mis necesidades y es comodo por lo que recomiendo ampliamente para el que desee comprarlo
5,ROCK'N WITH GUITAR HERO,"This was a great investment as a gift for my son, but mostly for the whole family, we all love jamming out with Guitar Hero Legends of Rock for PS3. It works great and we have already added an additional guitar so two can play at once."
4,Not As Bad As All Thes Other People Say It Is,"Everyone keeps saying how bad this game is, but in reality its not a bad game. It has a great list of songs, from KISS to Slipknot. I didnt have a problem playing the game. The wireless guitar worked perfectly fine and the game isnt bad at all. i did have one problem. i tried hooking my ps2 in the living room because i have a plasma their, but for some reason the fret buttons had a delay in hitting the notes, making it impossible to play a song. i have no clue why it does that because the tv has nothing to do with it. other than that, its a great game especially if you love to rock and roll."
4,guitar hero III christmas 2008,"The kids were all excited, but we had a time getting the signal thing to work on the ps2 but it did eventually. I would give this item a 3 for its functionality."
2,got old quick,i bought this for myself because my brother owned it and would bring it over and i would get hooked on playing it. but now years later all it does is sit in my closet collecting dust. I dont think anyone still plays anymore. the craze is over. anyone want to buy my junk? haha
3,Good but not great.,"Hello, I am a very intense guitar hero player,and I am very picky about the graphics and the quality of my guitar.I bought this game because a lot of people told me that it was 'awesomely coooool',so I got it.I liked it, but the graphics weren't that good but the song selection is great.And about the guitar, the guitar was okay but it felt very cheap and sometimes the buttons would slightly stick. And about 2 years later one of the buttons on the guitar wasn't working.Now I don't know if I was unlucky and my guitar happen to break ,or all of them are made cheap. And thats why it's good not great."
4,Guitar Hero,"I bought the Guitar Hero III Legends of Rock wireless Bumdle-PS2 for my grandsons, they live in another state, so I have not tried it. I have not heard if they have tried it yet. It did get delivered before Christmas, Thanks!!"
4,Great Father's Day gift!!,I bought this for my husband for Father's day from me and my 6 year old son. He was so suprised and very happy! I wanted to get him something that he'd find to be fun and since I knew he would have fun with a video game. I remembered he had metioned getting this one. So glad I did. It was also at a great price. The best price I could find and I did look around before buying.
5,Great Game!,This was a father's day gift for my husband and he loves it. He plays it every night. Our son loves it as well and I am getting better at it every day. It's much more challenging than you think. Highly recommend!
4,Not bad,"It's a well put together game, and it can be quite fun especially if you're playing with another person, but i found myself bored playing by myself. I'm not crazy about the song choices, I think the set list for guitar hero 2 suits me better. You should probably check out the song selection for either game before purchasing because it's not fun playing songs you don't like.There are basically no glitches at all at least with my game and guitar. I love that it's wireless, that's a really great idea."
1,Completely innapropriate for children,"Call me a stick in the mud.... or call me person with values... but Guitar Hero III has completely unnecessary sexual innuendoes throughout it and is anything BUT appropriate for children. From the nearly naked women dancing provocatively on stage, to the neon-light replica of a pole dancer, the makers of the game are obviously trying to appeal to both kids AND adults. Version I & II were top-sellers... there was no reason to introduce sexual material.I'm 26 and my husband and I both love the game... until the ""dancers"" are on stage. It irritates us BOTH. What a horrible way to ruin a great game. If I DID have children, we would play Guitar Hero II only. Guitar Hero III would never be allowed in my home."
2,Not for everyone,"I am not an avid gamer, but my family and I love the Kanomi Karoke series and have played them out. So in hopes of finding a new family game we bought into the Guitar Hero series. Hearing so much hype I figured buying into the third edition would be just as easy to catch on too and I would get the others later,but start with an all in one deal here.I have yet to catch on and I am so frustrated trying to learn to play that I dread when my husband wants to play. I will say, I have seen guys catch on much faster (very much a hand-eye cordination game). My husband enjoys the game, but all the same,it really does not hold his attention- I was hoping it would be good family fun, fun with friends during our hang out nights when instead its more like Jr high...boys in one corner girls in another. Not for my age group I guess (25-35)."
3,Poor Wireless - OK customer Service,"Bought a 2 wireless Kramer Striker guitar bundle with GHIII for my daughter for Christmas. Hooked up Christmas evening and the trouble began. The wireless Striker guitars would not work together. Individually they were OK, but when trying to face off, the wireless between the guitars interferes and neither work properly. The Game was totally unplayable. I sent it back to RedOctane and eventually received a full refund. It took a long time so my daughter went without a Christmas present for about a month and a half. I have great luck with Amazon and buy a lot of merchandise with Amazon, but I would recommend only buying GH III locally from reputable stores with good return policies. The game is OK (don't really care for the cheesy pre-programmed guitar battles). I rated it mediocre because the wireless Kramer Striker hardware is terrible."
4,Not as Good as Guitar Hero 2,"Positives: Songs are mostly good, when you get up to the higher levels, the songs are challenging in a good way, the guitar battles are funNegatives: graphics look cheap and not nearly as good as GH2. Songs not nearly as challenging to play as GH2 until you get to the higher levels. No toilet flushing sound. Harder to read text.Overall: GH2 is much better, BUT at least you get to keep playing with new songs"
4,Family Fun,"Awesome! This game is loads of fun. I play, my 11 year old daughter plays, friends play -- we all like it. This is our first Guitar Hero game so we can not compare it to previous ones but it is great. Definitely recommend for family fun especially if you are a music fan like we are."
2,Guitar Hero III,"I bought this game for my 12 year old son for Christmas. He set the game up easily and played several songs on his first attempt, however, when he tried playing the game later on Christmas Night, the guitar would not work. I understand this happens frequently with this game (from friends of his) and I wound up buying another guitar (non-wireless, non-Activision brand) which is working perfectly. I also played the game and would have rated it higher had the guitar not given out on the first day of play....Overall, a fun game for kids and adults though."
5,Not sure at first,"My son was given this as a Christmas gift. At first, he asked me to return it. Apparently, he thought about it for awhile and he decided to keep it afterall. He loves it! And he is really good at it! I've tried it -- I am terrible at it, but it was a lot of fun! I would recommend it."
3,Product disappointment...,"so yes while i enjoy guitar hero II and III very much; this was a present to my little brother in NC. so i had the product shipped there. i found out that after a few days the wireless guitar didn't work. because of the fact i don't live in the same state as my little brother i was at a loss of how to figure out what to do.my dad figured out a way to take care of it, but it made me sad he couldn't use the new guitar..."
5,THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"A+++++++++++++ THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!, I love the wirless guitar. choices of old songs and news songs to play was great. This would have to be my #1 game that i have ever played. so much fun."
3,Its okay.,"It had some good cuts on it ,but i would not rant and rave about it.It was easy listen music."
3,It's ok,"Well, I have Venus, as Sailor V on the cover. But what I don't like is the author adds in stuff not on the show. She adds in groups in America, like the Backstreet Boys and stuff like that. I want to be an author and I know that sort of stuff dates a book. I think she should keep to the show more."
4,SCHENKER'S DRUNK !!!,"FOR SURE THIS DVD IS VERY ENJOYABLE WITH JACK BRUCE, UFO AND MICHAEL SCHENKER AND ALSO MUSICIANS LIKE CLIVE BUNKER AND DON AIREY IS VERY COOL.THE SOUND AND PICTURE IS VERY HOT BUT FOR SURE IT WAS JUST BEFORE ULI CANCELLED THE REST OF THE TOUR WITH UFO/SCHENKER BECAUSE SCHENKER WAS TOO MUCH ON ALCOHOL AND IF YOU CAN LISTEN TO ROCK BOTTOM, HE HAVE SO MUCH MISERY TO PLAY (MAKING LICKS) HE ALWAYS MADE AND IT'S ULI WHO FINALLY BLOW THE GUITAR FOR THAT PART(MIDDLE OF THE SONG), ALSO (ULI)HE'S SO HOT IN LET IT ROLL MAKING HOT LEAD PARTS.IT WAS FOR US THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINALLY HAVE A CONCERT WITH THE 2 HOTTEST MASTERS OF GERMAN GUITAR FOR THE 1ST TIME AND SCHENKER IS DRUNK !HOPE THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR US TO SEE IT AGAIN WITH A SCHENKER IN BETTER SHAPE.ALSO, I HOPE THAT ULI WILL RELEASE A COMPLETE CONCERT OF HIS OWN STUFF IN THE NEAR FUTURE.LONG LIFE TO ULI, (SOBER)MICHAEL AND UFO !"
5,Mossy Oak camo,Cost more in the stores. Good quality. Picture doesn't do it justice. I was impressed upon shipment. You can't tell in the pic but it actually has the rubber grips and the mossy oak emblem. NICE!
5,Terrific Braiding Book for Long Hair,This large spiral bound book is filled with wonderful full page color photos and beautiful ink drawings of the different styles covered in the instructions.Instructions are clearly set forth - and there are many different levels of proficiency.A real treasure - I even learned a few new techniques to try on my 46 inch hair. The authors have a real winner!
2,Not sturdy enough - Warranty not much value,"Out of the box, this power supply looked great. But after a few months of moderate use, the unit broke and would no longer work. I thought, well, it's under warranty. However, in order to activate the warranty, you need to send $17 shipping and handling (along with the power supply)to Accessory Power. If they find that the malfunction is covered by the warranty, then they send you a new one. If they decide that it's not, they send you the original one back and you're out $17. In the long-run (unless you are a very light user), I think it's more cost effective to go with a genuine HP unit."
3,"works great, but is fragile","We got two of these, so we would not have to move the chargers around. They work great, but popped apart. We taped them with electrical tape."
4,This is a comprehensive book on speech coding,"This is a very good book on speech coding, especially focus on CELP coders. Many kinds of CELP coders are introduced in detail. If you are beginner on speech coding, this book is for you. But other coders, such as MBE and WI, are not presented. So I don't think it is a comprehensive book. I give it 4 stars."
2,Does Not Reflect Current Science,"I bought this book hoping that it would provide a decent overview of current work on anti-aging medicine. I was sorely disappointed. Benecke spends much of his time on popular culture, philosophical musings, and general health tips like vitamins and the effect of alcohol on heart disease.He does not cover the advances of the last 10 years in genetically engineering animals to live much much longer than the norm, using caloric restriction to extend life, the success of synthetic anti-oxidants in extending the lives of nematodes and fruit flies, or any other current scientific topic in anti-aging medicine."
5,Life and death is shaped by cellular life and death,"Biomedicine, aging and immortality are considered in The Dream Of Eternal Life: Biomedicine, Aging, And Immortality, a title that discusses the biological fundamentals of why death happens and how modern biology can explain its functions. Life and death is shaped by cellular life and death, the author explains: chapters consider the possibility of extending life through treatments and other options."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF FILM,"Strait to the point.It sucks big time.All the actors in it are totally bad.Such bad performances that it should win at the razzies for worst ensamble cast in a film.Also it should stick around at the ceremony because it will sweep up worst screenplay,director,production,makeup etc etc.Look i know its a low budget production but come on.There`s low budget and then there is no budget.My advise is remake it with good actors and a good director.Have the script worked on by a real writer and find a real producer and then it could have been up there with the excorcist and emily rose.Ps,the guy who played the father and the guy who played the priest should quit acting all together.There is bad acting and then there is no acting.Rediculous."
2,Linda Blair Has Nothing To Worry About!,"Talk about bad acting, bad editting, weak lines, and an ending that left me scratching my head, this movie can make the devil take a break from his evil and he would roll over laughing! If Linda Blair or anyone from The Exorcism of Emily Rose sees this movie, chances are they might demand to get that 90 minutes of their life back. Someone did not carefully stereotype the acting roles and script lines. They never showed what really happened to sheriff as he was attacked and few other scenes where left incomplete. I enjoy watching the behind-the-scenes footage that comes on most DVDs and even that was poorly done. In many segments I could hear the people because they played the background music too loud. I rented this DVD for $2 and that was a little too steep for a movie of this type."
2,DEVILISHLY INEPT,"This lowbudget ripoff of EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE fails on many counts: it's acting is mediocre, with even the usually reliable Cameron Daddo not up to snuff; the effects are minimal and shoddy; the pacing is slow, and it just doesn't have enough real scares. The subplot of the priest's romance with the possessed girl's sister is also dead weight. Although supposedly based on true events and with the sanction of the Catholic Church, the movie is just a direct to DVD timepasser."
5,Come On!,"People! It is an awesome movie! to tell you the truth, i could not understand why so many people gave it one star. i mean, everyone has there opinions and all, but give things a chance.my opinion:i absolutely loved this movie! it is a good as hell low budget film. i have nothing more to say other than give it a chance and look at it from a positive view."
5,WILLIAM ORBIT RULES!,"The playing, production and mixing techniques of William Orbit defy categorization. He balances soft, almost subliminal percussion and synth work, with FAT basslines, jamming loops, and ethereal echos and delays. He demonstrates his musical talent, his technical wizardry and production prowess in his solo records, (The Strange Cargo series), also his most recent release ""Hinterland"", as well as his work with Torch Song (""Towards the Unknown Region""). This CD was recorded in 1990. The Genre is dance. Although now 10 years old, this stands the test of time, and still sounds current. Standout cuts: Fascinating Rhythm, the title cut, and In the Realm of the Senses. EXCELLENT! You will NOT be disappointed! Check out his other work too!"
5,Bassomatic - Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Bass,Songs Include : In The Realm Of The Senses / Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Bass / Fascinating Rythm / Rat Cut-A-Bottle / Love Catalogue / Zombie Mantra / Freaky Angel / Wicked Love / Ease On By / My Tears Have Gone
1,The absolute WORST,It's shocking how bad this CD is. The only song worth listening to is The Hunter by The Moors. The other songs sound like they were produced by pre-teen DJs trying to make their first album. This is advertised as the first offering from this company... hopefully it will also be their last.Don't waste your money like I did.
3,"Cheap prop, gets the job done","For an adult costume, these are at least OK quality. The claws are the real sticking point on the item. They're basically just cheap plastic press on nails that have been glued to the glove material. Some of the claws on my set were not straight and others simply popped off (the glue was super strong on the other nails). In the end, I simply cut the tips off each finger. The claws were just annoying, anyway.The soft material used for the forearms was what I was more interested in, and that did the job just fine. The softer material rests on top of the thin glove material giving the illusion of a wrist warmer but the two are sewn together. It gives a nice feline look.Overall, it's still a cheap Halloween prop. But it's not a terrible Halloween prop."
4,"beautiful plate, bad packaging","I, too, was impressed by the beauty at a low price. However, upon opening the package a plate was completely shattered. I took it home from the store myself and I know the box wasn't jostled in any way. So, I agree with the previous reviewer that the packaging needs improvement."
2,Beautiful But Somewhat Disappointing,These dishes are gorgeous but a couple of pieces were not properly painted. The glace scratches very easily and the scratches are very visible.
4,"Excellent Bible, but a times too much translation","Outstanding bible for those new to bible reading, however regular readers may find some of the translation unnecessary. I love this translation but at times I found that they over-translated tried and true biblical phrases. Thus the new reader may not ever become familiar to some of the most meaningful verses in the bible. Small complaint but one I feel should be stated."
5,A Wonderful Study Bible !!!,"This Life application study bible is fantastic !!!I love the translation because it is accurate, and easy to understand. The footnotes are excellent !!! Really gets You thinking, and helps You to apply the scriptures to Your daily life .I have used other study bibles. This one is My favorite. Extemely user friendly. I know this bible is a true blessing to alot of people.If You want to be sure its the study bible for You, Go to your local Christian bookstore and page thru one first.I'm sure You will love it with whichever translation You decide to buy. The life application study bible is the one for Me.Have You been out Soul-witnessing recently ? Let's spread the good news of Jesus and salvation to the lost. Jesus will return in a blinking of an eye. All the lost will be lost for eternity...The Romans Road: Romans 3:23,Romans 6:23,Roman 5:8,Romans 10:13,Romans 10:9, Romans 12:1-2 God Bless You."
4,Hopper,"This is an adventure story for the little rabbit Hopper and his mother. Hopper likes to play with his friend Nick, who is also a little rabbit. It is hard for Hopper to live every day because he has to look for food in the cold snow while always being scared of being attacked by predators. He is taught many things from is mother and is constantly reminded of how to live day to day. It's a great story involving the furriest and cutest animals.Josh V."
3,On and On,"Colleen Carroll's book documents an exciting new movement towards religious orthodoxy among today's youth. I call the movement exciting because I am part of it, and I share many of the aspirations and thoughts expressed by the young people featured in this book. While it does an adequate job of displaying this trend and offering plausible explanations for its occurrence, I frankly found the book somewhat boring and repetitive. Personal story after personal story, the book drones on and on. I found myself dreading to pick it up again after having stopped for awhile. Thomas Aquinas never grows old indeed, but this book does after about the first 50 pages."
2,Conjecture & Catholic Propaganda,"This book is propped up and praised by members of the press as a ground breaking earth shattering piece of research; however no religious theologians have endorsed the authors' conclusions and her date simply isn't scientific. The statistical conclusions are conjuncture and do not support the authors' statements. Her methodology in interviewing a small cross section of the upper middle class, and elite do not constitute a major move toward orthodoxy in America. Twenty believers leaving Campus Crusade does not mean one iota; I don't think that is a significant number that supports her premise.Loyola Press should be ashamed for publishing this book! Oh, but it gives credence to the supposition that people are breaking down the doors of the Catholic Church to become members."
4,"Good, But...","This is an excellent book which shows how young Christians of all stripes are returning to their theologically conservative roots. I felt that the anecdotal comments from these ""new faithful"" were very enlightening, especially when they explain why they hold the theological views that they do. My only disappointment, however, is that, while Carroll includes young persons from many points in the broader catholic tradition (be they Roman, Orthodox, or Anglican), she totally ignores Lutherans, even when introducing individuals who are Pentecostal and Baptist. Are there none of these ""new faithful"" among the Lutherans? Was she unable to find them? Or has she given up on the Lutheran Church? In any case, such a serious omission of a major Catholic communion is certainly lamentable, and results in a much lower rating than would have otherwise been deserved."
3,Helpful,"Ms. Carroll adeptly employs the best techniques of investigative journalism, serious scholarship (her end notes are voluminous), and engaging narratives to provide her readers with a positive image of committed, young, conservative, North American Christians. She sketches the image of a generation disillusioned by their parents' liberal excesses, and inevitably drawn to more traditional expressions of the faith. Her text makes a perfect domestic companion to Philip Jenkins' more global, ""The Next Christendom: the Coming of Global Christianity."" Any serious student of current religion would do well to read this book."
3,Not quite what I expected,"I bought this book based upon a review I heard from Chuck Colson of Prison Fellowship. I was excited about the idea that someone had finally captured the essence of why young adults are yearning for something deeper than the typical ""seeker services"" so prevalent in The Church today. As an Evangelical Christian, however, I was disappointed that so much of the book is focused on Orthodox Catholics. As a professing Catholic herself, Ms. Carroll outlines her research with story upon story about the plight of young Catholics from post-Vatican II teaching. While I wish her research would have covered more Evangelical opinions, her writings have taught me more about Catholicism than I previously knew. I now have a fuller understanding, respect, and appreciation for conservative Catholicism. I just wish the reviews I had read had been more forthright about the content. I would highly recommend this book to my Gen X/Y Catholic friends, but probably not for the Evangelical's."
2,so-so........where's Raven?,"This cd was okay. Personally, the movie was good, the cd for the movie was good but that's it! I hate when least famous people keep coming back up. 3LW's Adriane Balon (i spelled it wrong) and Keeley (i spelled that wrong, too) Have had a taste of music life but who is that crazy white girl? and, where is Raven? She was the star and some dummy cut her out of the group. Raven has a great voice, by the way.Cheetah-licious is not a word but if some loser saw that cd cover and didn't see the movie, he'd think they were being sexual. I think the ""Cheetah-girls"" is a baby group name. If the girls picked out a grown up name like "" The pussycat dolls"" I HATE THAT GROUP!!! those girls are dirty hoes.anyway, the cd would've been better if it had more style. it was too disney and too ""ooooh"" if they grew up, they'd be in. by the way, add Raven back to the group.But seriously, who is that crazy white girl?"
4,ok.......,"I haven't gotten this c.d yet,and there's a big chance I will never get it,because I really don't like the songs.I might be buying Radio Disney Jingle Jams instead,yet I would like to say something.All the girls have great voices.Yeah the Cheetah girls sounds like a strange name,but since most bands or singers that such simlier names.These young women I should say are trying something that no other singer/band has done.Also since when is Cheetah-licious sound sexual??It doesn't! Raven is a great singer,but hey chances are she is too busy with her new clothing line and makup line to worry about a band group.No one cut her off the band she that herself."
2,Why is 3LW trying to comeback with a little kids group?,"Why is 3LW trying to comeback when they was'nt that good when they were ""three little women"". I mean they was okay but why stick with a kids movie called the Cheetah Girls and then make it a official disney group. I like the song ""Cheetah-licious Christmas"" because it is like, R&B; mixed with Christmas Fun. But can you all just stick to acting!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S The reason I gave it 2 stars because I liked that song ""Cheetah-licious Christmas"" but if I never listened to that song, I would give them 1 star."
1,Yikes!,"I played and enjoyed Smart's Battlecruiser Millennium Gold, and hoped this would be a solid update in the series. Boy, was I wrong. This game is a mess - incredibly buggy, the graphics are a little better than BMG but not by much, and it lacks the stately, thoughful pace of previous games that allowed the player to immerse himself (or herself) in the Battlecruiser universe.Please, save your money. If you want to play a game where the concept worked much better, buy a copy of Battlecruiser Millennium Gold. It's a bit dated, but thoroughly enjoyable."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This game is horrible! It has frequent crashes, sub-standard graphics, and an impossible to decipher interface. The game crashed on me 4 times in a row within 5 minutes of starting it up. The graphics are nowhere near games like Homeworld. It's almost impossible to figure out or remember what keys do what in this mess of a game. Avoid like the plaque, throw it out even if you got it for free...your time is worth more than the suffering."
1,They don't get much worse,"I bought this game, hoping that it would provide me with something fun to do whenever I had free time. Yes, the prospect of engaging enemies in major battles for control of numerous spaceports and bases on 4 different theatres of combat appealed to me. So, between this and spending $39.95 on Joint Operations, I chose this.What was I thinking?This game freezes often, and I can't even find the ""Quit"" option. Apparently, the developers wanted to make it a puzzle just trying to figure out how to move your ship or fire your guns. You can't do anything in this game, it crashes, freezes, you can't control it, and in the campaign you dont even know what to do. The best part is that you can't even save or load or go to an options screen. This waste of a CD should be taken out of every store in the world. Trust me, I enjoy all sorts of games from Hearts of Iron to Raven Shield to Battlefield 1942 and Starfleet Command III - DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY OTHER GAME MADE BY DEREK SMART."
5,"Amway Corporate History, Distributor Bios, and FAQ's","A slightly outdated book describing a brief history of the Amway Corporation, some profiles of sucessful distributors, and several frequently asked questions. Good material, but contains several facts that no longer apply to the corporation or its millions of distributors."
5,Best cookbook ever!,"I use this cookbook all the time! It is very user friendly. When I am done cooking, my food tastes just like my grandma's. It has become my bible for Louisiana cooking and would be a delight for gourmet cooks anywhere. It has hundreds of recipes including soups and gumbos, rice dishes, cakes and pastries, and meat dishes of all manners. It has evidence of influences from multiple cultures of the Mississippi Delta. They make great presents for not only brides but grooms as well. [...]"
2,Very poor nonstick,Design of this pot is excellent but the nonstick comes off easily(very soft). Did the makers ever test their product?I treat my cookware very well and use the proper utensils.Dont even try a metal utensil. Shame on Farberware.
2,nonstick coating comes off too easy,I purchased the 14 pc set at Kohls and was very excited at first. It seemed to cook really well. After using a few times the nonstick coating is coming off. I have only used plastic utensils and have not cooked on high. I plan on returning them to the store.
1,worst fitting bumper in the world,"I want to give this 0 stars but 1 was the lowest, it does not fit a standard size crib and has flimsy strings that are barley long enough to tie around the slats. It is cheaply made and gets lumpy when washed. I do not recommend it under any circumstances."
4,nice book,nice book it exsplane all about pay pal so you under stander it anyone having trouble with pay pal will get a better understanding of this by reading this book
1,A Colossal Waste,"We could tell there was some ""chemical"" remains when we opened it - there was a smell. We washed it before using. During the first use she complained of a burning sensation. The burning continued for a few days after use. To experience the burning I put it in my mouth (don't laugh). Sure enough, my mouth was burning with nettle like tingling for quite a few hours. Never one to quit, we washed and washed it again. We soaked it. Did everything we could think of to remove the ""chemical"". Needless to say, 2nd time was not a charm (more burning / nettle like tingling). It straightway made it into the garbage."
2,ENORMOUS!!!!,"This thing is freaking HUGE!!! I couldn't believe it... the size of a small wrist! OMG! My boyfriend always wants to use it and I just can't handle it. Also, the material is like a pacifier jelly and EVERYTHING gets stuck to it (we have a dog... so thats not fun)... So if you are in an hermetically sealed environment and feeling loose GET IT!"
3,fun,"I liked it, but dang it was long.Best to use a condom over it causee the smell they put on it and it can be irritatting no matter what. even washing it alot wouldnt get the smell or feel of the stuff they put on it off."
3,Almost 4 stars...,"I was torn, but despite the fact that there are couple briliant songs on here, the whole CD doesn't quite come together well enough to give it 5 stars. I first heard the band when I Touch Myself came out, and I was surprised such an overt song would get airtime on mainstream, Canadian AM radio. The song is more than just a bubble gum pop song -- when you think about it, it's a very empowering song celebrating female sexuality, a subject that is usually considered taboo. I like Lay Your Body Down for the same reason. I'm On Your Side is one of my favorite ballads. Overall, however, even though the rest of the songs aren't bad, they aren't anything brilliant, either. A good, solid, standard rock album that you won't be disappointed in, though it likely won't warrant heavy rotation in your CD player, either."
3,n,"value for the money. enjoyable, convenient, easy to use, i like to use this app on a regular basis for fun."
4,"Not only ""I Touch Myself""...","Though it seems at a first glance that the only good song of the whole album would be ""I Touch Myself"" this is actually a complete work, filled up with a few good cuts, carefully produced and arranged, appart from the smashing hit single mentioned which, however, makes it worth enough.Christina Amphlett's voice is astonishingly unique, which surely made her one of the most important vocalists from Australia, if not the most relevant.And it is fully demonstrated in this album..."
2,sex appeal doesnt save this one,"i mean no disrespect to the divinyls' gorgeous lead vocalist Christina Amphlett when i say that her band was a one-hit-wonder. there is no denying that ""i touch myself was a shamelessly perverted success, but it was simply not enough to pull this one from the gutters."
5,Sexy and Exciting...,"Just about every song is rich with energy. I love the vocals and could listen to this CD all day. I have about 10 CD's I never tire of and always come back too. This is one of those CD's. I remember when the ""I touch myself"" single came out and loved the song but the CD is full of great songs. I can't believe they only managed to have one hit in the USA."
2,Ya I gave it two stars,"The only song I was interested in was ""I touch myself "".Seems this CD was more an experiment.You most likely would like only one tune as well.I feel someone should have played with Her Lyrics a bit more.The Band members sounded like Robots with no spirit or Soul.But I really Liked her voice just wished the rest of the tunes Bounced as well as "" I Touch My Self """
5,CHICKEN,"I'd have to say I love this song! I touch myself describes exactly the way I feel all the time! Being a hairy chicken isn't easy but this makes it all worthwhile! When I listen to this song it makes me want to run free through a field or do a dance number to it in front of the class!XOXO ChickenP.S. I also think this would be a great song for the soundtrack on my horror movie trilogy, the ""Chicken will hunt you down"" trilogy."
2,"She Is Pretty, But...","Fairly standard chick pop band notable mostly for novelty hit ""I Touch Myself"" and the lead singers endowments. Fans of the song will probably be pleased, though the there is little variation in the sound. Similar in tone and sound to Roxette. You really don't need to own this."
2,Not The Best,"Fairly standard pop band notable mostly for novelty hit ""I Touch Myself"". Fans of the song will probably be pleased, though the there is little variation in the sound. Similar in tone and sound to Roxette. You really don't need to own this."
5,Wonderful science memoir,"This book details the author's childhood love of chemistry, from spectacular reactions to his study of the periodic table.He tells the stories of some early chemists who discovered elements. For Sacks, each element seems like a complicated and fascinating, automaton toy.His family history, treated almost as an afterthought, is intriguing as well."
5,Loving things,"It reveals a wonderful way of discovering and loving chemistry, showing that it's everywhere."
5,overall very happy,"book shipped a little slower than I liked BUT within the allotted amount of time. In excellent condition!!! Better than expected. Overall, very happy."
2,Not his best,"Typical Sacks fare is an engaging exploration of his scientific interests and some fascinating tangents. That Oliver Sacks is(apparently) a very interesting man helps a lot, too. Like most of us though, Oliver Sacks was not a very interesting child. While ""Uncle Tungsten"" has some very good science writing, it is really nothing more than the story of a socialy inept boy who went rather too far with his chemistry set. Again, like most of us, his family was strange. If you haven't picked up ""The Isle of the Colorblind"" or ""The Man who mistook his wife for a hat"", get them instead. If you're a hard-core Sacks fan, pick this one up at the library first."
2,Maybe the hardest kind of book to write,"I loved some of the science in Sack's book but the autobiographical part was embarrassing at points.It seemed to me that it's very hard to write this type of book with out sounding like you are bosting of your intelligence. One of the few book's that did pull it off for me, where an intelligent boy tells of his growing up, was Bryce Courtenay The Power of One. In chapter 21 Sacks tells of reading Eve Curie's biography of her mother and how it impressed him. He says ""it was no dry recital of a life's achievements, but full of evocative, poignant images"" I only wish this book could have been that way for me. I guess I wanted a book that got to my heart like 'Power of One'this book never came close."
1,frustrating book,"I can usually like a book if I try hard enough, but this one won't even meet you halfway. Descriptions of colors, textures, properties of elements. Descriptions of the containers elements are often kept in. Sacks is clearly enthusiastic though, and I see he has succeeded in passing on his excitement to some other reviewers, but without any enticing hooks or surprises, the book only left me with that ""hours of someone else's vacation photos"" feeling."
1,"Don't read, please.","This book is so bad. It is not interesting at all. If you don't have a chemical background, you will not understand it. Mr. Vincelette must die!the end"
5,Uncle Tungsten,"This is the second copy of Uncle Tungsten for me. I bought it when it was first released, loved it, and, unfortunately, loaned it to one too many friends. Now I have one to browse my favorite bits in, revisit the very different childhood of a man my age. Oliver Sachs treats his younger self with the same wide-eyed curiosity as he affords his patients."
5,Full of odd facts,"If you've ever wondered how an electric doorbell was powered in Victorian London - you'll find out in this book. Have no fear, it involves chemistry. Must read if you are into science or history of science with personal touch."
5,This book is the help I have been searching for...,"I love this book. I never write reviews, but I felt the need to write this one. This book is really good. I am a Mom who has a second grade son who is not reading at a level that I am comfortable with. Although, he is classified by the school as ""average"" or ""slightly below average"", he is still struggling with fluency and comprehension. Because he is average, he isn't getting the additional help that I know that he needs to be ready to enter third grade. This book has laid out the gameplan that I need to help my son succeed AND IT IS WORKING! This book is written to help kids at three different levels, so I am also using it to also help my very bright kindergartener learn to read at an even more effective and rapid rate. It is a lot of hard work for you and your child, but it is worth it. This book is definitely worth your time and money."
4,A helpful tool,"Of the several resources I gathered to help me and my first grade granddaughter, this is the one I saved. There are helpful tests provided to determine current reading level and to assist with developing a strategy. It also covers the behaviors to expect from a struggling reader. No they aren't lazy, or necessarily hyper. Trying to read is somewhat punishing and they'll do almost anything to avoid it, including multiple trips to the restroom. An excellent reference. Time for me to review it again myself."
5,It's About Time!,"I homeschooled my children and taught Kindergarten and First Grade in public and private schools. Where was this book when I needed it? As I went through the chapters, I easily identified students I had worked with (under a cloud of frustration both on their parts and mine.) The information is set up in these chapters so that even non-professional educators can understand. And I think the point is that parents have more of a chance to impact their children's reading ability than some teachers ever dreamed. This encouraging book is a must for any parent kid team currently wrestling with beginning reading. AND ... for those kids who have hit a brick wall, here's the answer."
5,Tried and True,"Having used the concepts from this book, I was able to tutor a third grader who was two grades behind to the point where she was actually above grade level. All of this with only 45 minutes a week from me and 15 minutes of daily practice reading with her father. At the beginning of the semester she was almost put in the special education class, by the end of the semester she was reading with her peers. This book is so easy to read and well laid out that anyone can become a successful tutor for almost any child. Peggy explains the reasons for reading difficulties along with the solutions. She even includes practical reading aids in the back of the book. Nothing is left to chance. Not just a teach your child to read book, but also a teach yourself to tutor book."
2,Writing is far from refined,"The writing is fragmented and incomplete statements are often seen, for example:1. in section 4.6.4, it is written""If A and B are vectors, A&&B returns true if both words arepositive integers."" then no words there to specify ""otherwise"" part. If you assume otherwise A&&B returns false, you are wrong,since A&&B returns true when both are negative integers too.2. In 7.5.1, it says ""There are two forms for delay control,...The first form is ..."", but the second form is never explained or mentioned there.3. You often seealways @ ( a or b ) in examples with ""or"" in boldface,but I could not find where ""or"" is defined. Even though Iunderstand its meaning, I wish to tell the differece fromusing ""|"" , ""||""4. ... plus many typosThese cause a lot confusion in reading"
3,Good Product; bad smell,"This is a quality product and an excellent tool for increasing storage space, however it smelled like it had been stored in a barn. I've been spraying fabric refresher for several days on it and it still smells terrible."
4,Better than I had expected,This is better than what I had expected. Shelves are sturdier than what I thought they would be.
3,"Nice graphics, entertaining story, arcade-style ""puzzles""","This is not your typical puzzle-based adventure game. Most of the puzzles were classic arcade-style or brain teaser games that had little to do with the story. (Pong?)What I liked about the game is that it truly was an interactive story, and one that held my interest. I also liked that the viewing control inside the world was 360/3D. You still moved from point to point, though. I found it similar to Myst III in that respect. I also thought the plot line, cut scenes, and characters had merit.The main issue I had with this game was the situations where you could ""die"" if you didn't move quickly enough and know exactly what to do. It's a bit stressful for someone who doesn't like shoot-em-up action games. However, the game is also forgiving in that it restarts you fairly close to where you died, so not much time is wasted repeating things as in some other games like this.I played this entire game in about 6-7 hours one Sunday afternoon."
3,Cool graphics but not much else!,"I bought this game thinking it would be a lot like Myst, and it is. It's got amazing graphics (though not above and beyond everything else out there) and some good puzzle solving, but the game was really short and lots of it was pretty annoying.So much of it was just wandering around through mazes trying to figure out what the heck still needing doing (invariably it was picking up some stick that looked like part of the landscape). And it only took me a few days to beat it and I wasn't really playing for more than a few hours a day.There are better strategy games out there for the price I think. I was pretty disappointed with this game."
2,"Yes, another get-stuck-in-a=cave game","The game seems to have beautiful graphics; but unless you have the simple faith of an overgrown child, and believe that having a lot of time just ripped out of your life for no reason whatsoever is a good thing, you will NEVER get to see the graphics, because your first task is to find some way out of the belly of some sort of ship, but there is not the slightest clue as to how you're supposed to do this.Theoretically, that means that you have to scan literally every pixel of the ship's interior (using a rather inefficient lamp) and hope to god you have the dumb luck to bump into the right trigger that opens the door to the next level. That is not in any definition of ""puzzle"" or ""mystery"" with which I'm familiar.Well, I don't like wasting my time; and I don't like game designers who think I should."
1,HATE this game!,"I needed a walkthrough to get through a lot of it. I got stuck on a shoot-em-up game and I tried for 3 hours to kill off the ""gods."" They need a ""skip"" button for these types of things. I play games to relax; not to get stressed out and carpal tunnel syndrome playing the same stupid thing over and over and over until I couldn't stand it anymore. I could not move forward because this particular part of the game was so annoying. It irritated me so much I said, forget it, and I uninstalled it. It wasn't worth trying to move on after 50 tries."
2,Fall's Short,"*Review based on Demo*Poor voice acting, bad script, falls short in so many ways.I wanted to like this game, but it was dull and uncreative. Just a bad production altogether. I wouldn't pay more than $5 for this game. At that price I might be able to stomach it's inadequacies."
4,Cotton Webbing Roll,"It is just plain webbing as often seen under upholstered furniture in the past. I bought it to effect repairs to my Coleman ice chest. The hinges often break on this type of chest. Cut a length of webbing to suit, remove screws from hinge, place piece of webbing between hinge and chest, reinsert screws. Voila, good as new. Thanks to my Latino friends for this neat idea. Too bad it isn't available in shorter rolls, but hey, I can now fix the hinges on the next 149 chests that I may need to repair."
5,Don Camilo,"This is a wonderful book.It can be read any number of times. Still it does not lose its innate humour and charm.As a political satire it is even better than any of George Orwell's books.A book for all times and for all ages. Human foibles and weaknesses and Divine Virtues are abundantly portrayed in this book.It makes fun of the Catholic Church as well as the Communists.A truly inspiring work. I am only sorry that I do not know Italian.Since to read it in the original language would give the greatest pleasure.If anyone is not satisfied after reading it.Tell me .I will buy it from you. I have given this book away to many of my friends and foes alike.yours sincerely ,Diljit C.Shah,E-mail:diljitshah@yahoo.co.in."
5,makes a great makeup primer!!!,"I know this might sound silly, but this stuff makes a fantastic makeup primer! I saw someone post it on a website and thought I'd give it a try. It contains most of the same ingredients as the very expensive, high end makeup primers. It works BEAUTIFULLY! and it's so much cheaper."
1,whate size is this?,The help department at babysRus.com is awful. I am not able to ascertain the size of this product or find a way to determine the same. I would have purchased this product 3 times over if I had only been able to reach a human being or to find some usable text.
2,*Bassinet sways too much!!!,"I bought this play yard when I had my daughter in August,05. I loved that it wasnt bulky and looked easy to travel with.**MY only draw back is the bassinet part ""IT SWAYS WAY TOO MUCH"" kinda like a hammock! The bassinet part isnt supported enough, it just hangs suspended and it rolls my infant all around any time she moves!!! I decided to transition my daughter at 4 months old from her regular bassinet to this play yard so I could still keep her in my bedroom. I thought this would be a good idea until I placed her in the bassinet part. The first night when I placed her on her back she ended up on her side and belly with NO effort! she was all over the place due to the swaying and poor placement/attachment of the bassinet pad. ** I would not recommened the use of the bassinet part to someone with a newborn or small infant for it could be dangerous. I think it just needs to be designed better."
4,Great for stationary use,"We were given this item as a shower gift off of our registry and have used it from the first day our son came home. We kept it next to our bed for probably the first two months and alternated having our son sleep in the bassinet part or in bed with us. When my husband's job took him to another state for a project for a few months, he took the play yard with him to keep in his corporate apartment so that our baby would have his own place to sleep when we'd come to visit. It worked out well. Our only complaint is that it is difficult to set up and fit into it's carrier bag- pay attention when you take it out or disassemble it the first time!!!"
3,Its ok...,I have had this playard for a while and If you dont know the tricks to it there is no way to know how to actually use this thing the right way..its really annoying first of all you have to lock all the rails before you push the center down otherwise those top rails will never lock and i never remembered it saying that in the book. The bassinet was ok but the cardboard mattress (its literally just hard cardboard not a mattress at all) is way to hard for a baby to sleep in when it is the full size crib so I had to go out and buy a porta crib mattress and sheet which is not portable at all..its a pain in the a** to take this thing anywhere. So basically this product just does the job but it is not worth buying or investing your money into..actually many of evenflo's products arent and Graco isnt much better
4,"Part Horse Book, Part Western","Author Bill Gulick does a good job painting the setting of the southwestern Idaho Territory and southeast Oregon in the early 1860s. Not that the sage and cinders have changed that much in almost 150 years. His lead character is a bit of a ne'er do well, but he's got a decent heart. Born and raised in the area, Corporal Burke Langdon loves the land and the art of the deal more than he loves the Army. He also bucks Army wisdom by preferring the scruffy-looking Nez Perce ponies known as Appaloosas. He is charged with taking six of them from Fort Boise to Fort Walla Walla. On a side trip to see a girl, he runs into a wagon train of stubborn Missourians, a Snake Indian war party, and a group of Army deserters. The action is tight, believable, and not overblown. Gulick does a good job staying true to history while telling an interesting, tense tale. It's also a muted tribute to the Appaloosa."
3,"A good book, though a little annoying at times","I must admit that writting from the Orcs point of view is a good idea. But Im affraid that Stan does'nt pull it off particulary well. He strays from the traditional orc charater too much, having them sing of fair orcish ladies and the such.All books (it is said) have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Not so in this case. The entire story seems the ""middle"", completely lacking a begining or end. That means that there was no final battle, and the book ended abruptly.There are good points however. The beginning chapter is so gripping that it will probably motivate you to read half the book in one sitting. Its fast paced and delivers a lot of action through out. The characters are a little cold, but when it comes to a battle, Stan directs them well.It's worth checking out if you intend to spend time reading the entire series. It does leave you with the incentive to buy the next novel by leaving you on a cliff hanger at the end of the book."
3,"Good, entertaining fantasy with a twist","A proud people of warriors at one with Nature struggling to adjust to a world brought to change by invaders from across the sea. Yes, it does sound like a number of native people all around the world to me, too.But in this book it is the orcs, who normally are treated as bad guys by default, who defend their traditions and way of life in a fantasy world invaded by humans. The humans pollute, exhaust natural resources and generally make things bad for everyone else, all in the name of their One True God.It is a good twist, but it's not a great book. The characters are somewhat stereotype. It's more of an RPG adventure than a novel. But there is a lot of fighting (it is about orcs, after all) and of course an epic quest to embark on. I can recommend you to read it because it is a quick, fun read with some nice ideas and twists."
1,"This book is really for ""dummies""!","The posted reviews led me to believe that this was a book for someone who wanted to know Napoleon without too many details about his battles, etc. I did NOT expect to read a book where the author inserts his inane, superfluous comments from beginning to end! I think it was a compilation of lectures he has given with jokes and asides to make the audience laugh. I give it one star because it accomplished the objective of giving a broad outline of Napoleon so that I now know more about Napoleon. But as a book, I would put it at the bottom of all the books I have ever read.I don't expect you to include this since it would affect your sales."
4,Napoleon for Dummies,This history is enjoyable and easy to read. The editorial commentary on Napoleon's successes and failures makes the book read like a TV week-in-review interview and gives it a fresh feel.
2,Gel is so much better,"This is a liquid not a gel. My mistake for ordering it without carefully reading it, but frankly I read the description a few times and it simply did not describe the product that well. It requires a blanket or other covering after application to work. It does not have the same hot/cold feel of the gel. I could not tell it was working when I tried it on me. Used it on my horses but went back to the gel as it did not appear to help them."
5,Have used for years.,"My father used this on the horses for years and it always worked for them. I used it today on my older dog that was having problems due to arthritis. I rub a small amount on a towel, then rub the towel on the shoulder. Oh my gosh! I should have done this months ago. I will be getting somemore tomorrow!"
2,Horse yes - me no.,I got this on the advice of a friend. It was supposed to work wonders for arthritis. It didn't work for me.
4,Honda Sabre & Magna,"This is an excellent reference for an owner of the early Sabre and Magna. The quality of the manual itself is rather poor and is lacking on some detail, but overall the manual is an excellent reference."
1,haynes honda manual,"Very poor quality. Printed on newsprint. Photos are poor. The is no ""D"" section in the index. Haynes should be embarassed with this product. Would be acceptable at about $5."
4,Nice Strategy Guide,"Xenogears, first of all, is an excellent game which I recommend to everyone. This strategy guide is mainly for those who don't exactly understand everything about RPGs. It has a step-by-step method that makes maps almost unnecessary, and I think if you're planning on buying a Xenogears strategy guide, this is the one for you."
2,Don't buy this book unless you like being spoiled...,"This book contains way to many spoilers. It also lacked quite a bit of information. The only time it really helped me was in the Solaris base, seince that area is very confuseing. having beat the game, it covers up MOST major spoilers, HOWEVER, in the back of the walkthrough, it has a major spoiler, Even the back cover has a spoiler. It also left out a lot of items, weapons, and accesories. It even lacks one major secret. Don't buy this book until you beat the game. Even the character profiles contain spoilers, and it needs maps!"
4,My first game guide book and I like it,"I read the the book when I first bought it. It was nicely illustrated and shows the gears. It really helped me through some difficult levels. One god thing about the book is that it shows the HP, etc of the bosses. But one thing I dun really like is that it does not show all the gears. For example, Fei has a total of three gears throughout the whole game. But the book only shows the first gear. I think that they should maybe show all the gears in one or two pages. At least we would know how it looks. But overall, I not only like the book, I love it!! Go get it if you have the game but you dun have the guide book yet."
3,This book tried to be too many things!,"The problem with this book is that it tried to address the need for a SOURCEBOOK which is absolutely essential for understanding the complex story of this game. Who the hell else was confused? Perhaps you can help me out here. Too many spoilers in the wrong places, with no follow up.The game was incredible and it deserves a more in-depth role-playing type book which would help us all keep the facts straight. Mind telling me who Grahf really is? And Miang!?"
4,The Book wasnt all that great,"The Xenogears strategy guide helped me a lot in certain areas where I got stuck, but then again the directions were a bit off and confused me at times. I had to rely on my desire to explore levels before I actually knew what to do. The art and overall design of the book was really good, and the enemy index in the back helped me a lot. At times I regret buying the book, but then again, it did help me when I got lost and didn't know what to do. I highly recommend that you rely on yourself ( and not the book)to beat the game, but if you need help, the guide does work."
4,One problem...,The only problem with the book is that it does not have maps! and detailed walkthrough. It is very general
2,"Amazing game, shame about the guide...","I think it's agreed by all that Xenogears is one of the best RPG produced. It's a pity then that the strategy guide doesn't live up to that reputation.Although I did find it useful in places, the fact that parts of the walkthrough is completely wrong and some secrets were missed out didn't help.From a design point of view, the book is terrible. Empty white spaces made me thnk the book was being padded to fill pages and there is a general lack of artwork from the game. It's a shame as the publisher is usually excellent at producing strategy guides (Parasite Eve & FF VII).Buy the book if you really are stuck. Otherwise there's always the internet..."
4,Xenogears-the guide how does it measure up,"Squaresoft makes some of the longest, best, and most challenging RPGs (Role Playing Games) for the Playstation. Xenogears is no different. 1 hour into the game you need help. To the rescue is the Official Strategy Guide. The guide is well illistrated with art work from the game as well as detailed maps of each area. It tells you in detail how to defeat each area thouroughly and get all there is to get from the game. Although when it comes to boss fights the guide lacks. It does not measure up. The help it does give is not really helpful. This guide helps you but also spoils some secrets and leaves you hanging during boss fights."
3,"A great book from Brady Games, but that's not saying much...","I just don't think Brady Games gets it. If you're going to make a strategy guide for a game that relies heavily on plot, you _don't_ want to spoil it. Also, they could have crammed more stuff in the pages, like MAPS!! I still got lost in those 3-D worlds!In conclusion, their FF7 book was bad, and so is this. It does, however, get an extra star for being complete (at least, I HOPE it's complete).I don't know how this became the ""official"" guide."
2,2nd To Worst Guide I've Ever Seen,"This is one of the worst guide I've ever seen. First of all there aren't any maps. Maps are essential for a strategy guide if you ask me. Especially for a game as large as Xenogears. Even with the ""directions"" in the walkthrough given, you'll end up in the wrong place. You'd have better luck stumbling around a dungeon at random than trying to rely on the information this guide provides. To add insult to injury, more than half of the information in the beastiary is wrong.I really can't recommend this guide at all. Only get it if you simply must have everything Xenogears. Relying on this guide to beat the game will give you more frustration than it's worth."
4,my rating for the xenogears stratgey guide. please read.,WARNING: do not turn to page 174- 178 without covering up 175 and 176 becuase it shows the ending. i find this a good book if you need help or have xenogears. some people say it is a little vague. ex. go southwest to the end then turn west and into the next area. it refers to the compass and i found it better than go down the hall till..... the ff7 maps are better. it tells you all the creatures you'l face in the area. it has a monster guide but it doesn't tell you weaknesses or where you encounter them. it also doesn't tell you where to find items. but all in all i would recomend this strategy guide to anyone that has the game.
2,"Spoilers, Spoilers, and more Spoilers","This book is fine and dandy...if...you like spoilers, you can't turn the page without the fear of the plot being spoiled.But it tells you what you need to know."
4,"Practical, and as described","Delivery well withing the guideline.Product practical and as described.Simple and effective way of connecting cage wire and aviary wire.This set of clips is not suitable for industrial or heavy weight wire. I used 19 gauge aviary wire when making my own cages for my birds, so this was great.Recommeded product, and by buying from USA was cheaper than going through Ebay with sellers in this country."
1,This cd is meant for the dollar pile,"Hey Suburban Noize fans. If your wondering about this cd and see any other reviews that say it's good, trust me! It's NOT! This cd is loaded with lousy slow DJ tracks that go nowhere! It's basically one big lousy DJ cd. It has Judge D, D-Loc,, Pakelika and a bunch of the KMK team, but they all FAIL to bring a beat!If you have noticed, KMK has been signing up a ton of bands. I think they have are trying to do to much at once and it's severly showing lack there of from Tsunami Brothers and from Pakelika! Two HUGE failer cds! I'm hoping KIngspade, Humble Gods and the KMK future releases are better than this.Right now I can't even explain how TERRIBLE this cd is! There is not even a single song that I like and I doubt you would like either.Save your money!"
1,"If you like spy stories with steamy sex, this book is for you.",But not for me. I removed it and One Night of Scandal – both about the Kestrel brothers – from my Kindle list.
3,Chronos Blu-Ray Poor Quality,"I bought this title with great anticipation after having read reviews on other sites. But I was very disappointed. The video quality is just not good. It looks like a poor quality film transfer. I haven't seen the DVD version, but I doubt that the Blu-Ray is any improvement.In the opening scenes with the rock formations in the desert, it looks like a low resolution, non-HD image. It just doesn't have the apparent depth that I expect from HD. There is also lots of grain. I can understand some film grain, especially in low light conditions. But this is a bright daylight scene and there is just too much grain.At first, I thought I had a defective copy. So I returned it to Amazon for replacement. The replacement is the same.I also bought Baraka. There is no comparison. Baraka's quality is amazing (except for the playback issues)."
2,Poor BD Transfer,"While Baraka on BD is astounding, a must-have, the quality of the BD transfer seems little better than DVD. Obviously the same care that went into the Baraka transfer was not taken with this title. Price not withstanding, the BD version should have been so much better. If you already have the DVD, I wouldn't bother upgrading. If you already have Baraka on BD, I would not recommend buying this title on BD. It's going to disappoint. If the transfer had been better, this would have been a good buy. The content is not bad. Bottom line: Skip this one and buy Baraka on BD."
3,Lacking Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound,"I saw this movie probably 10 times at the Los Angeles IMAX when it debuted. The sound, if I recall correctly, was in surround. I'm disappointed this disk was in stereo. I would be willing to pay up to 3x more for the 5.1 surround. Unapix are you listening?"
1,"Terrible HDTV quality, a total bluray disappointment","I had hoped this would be similar to the WONDERFUL Baraka movie. That film is epic, engaging and memorable. This film was in contrast terrible. The quality someone chose during the transfer to bluray was a disaster. I should have returned it while I could. Luckily I only paid ten dollars for this. Baraka is phenomenal in comparison..."
2,Very Disappointing,"I bought this BluRay on the recommendations here on Amazon. I have owned Koyaanisqatsi on a number for formats for many years and, although it is becoming dated, believe it is the epitome of its gendre. I was looking forward to a similar movie experience with this film.How disappointing. I thought I was watching a student film of someone who had seen Koyaanisqatsi many years ago and had forgotten that, believing these were fresh insights. Many of the images are quite beautiful, but many seem very similar if not the same stock used in Koyaan. Where was this movie going? What was it trying to portray? It seemed to end before it got started. How many times in the music am I just hearing the sound of capacitors slowly discharging?Caveat emptor on this film; I strongly warn against buying it sight unseen."
1,GARBAGE DISC WON'T PLAY ON MY PS3 BLU-RAY PLAYER,If you intend to play this disc on a PS3 DO NOT PURCHASE IT. It doesn't work on the PS3. What a rip off.
2,Irritating music. Slightly interesting time lapse photography.,The music was very irritating. It sounded like a key was stuck on an organ. The concept of time lapse photography was slightly interesting.
4,Handling Problems,"The film Chornos is very good, The problem is with the handling of the disc in shipping the disc came off the hub in the case and moving around in shipping the disc was damaged."
2,Weak and Pointless,"Fricke's cinematography is as gorgeous as it was in Koyaanisqatsi, but he doesn't know what to do with it. The montages are meaningless, and that's a death-blow for a film. Perhaps Godfrey Reggio could have assembled the footage in a meanigful way, but sadly he and Fricke had parted company.The music by Michael Stearns fits the film perfectly, as it is shallow and with little merit. Listening to it once gives you all that it has to offer. Remember that old characteristic of art being inexhaustable? By exhausting itself in a single sitting, Stearns' score finds itself at the wrong end of the spectrum. It's un-art,non-art, negative-art, or trash.I'm sorry I saw this film once and will never bother to repeat the empty experience.If you like the Qatsi trilogy, don't expect anything comparable here. Chronos is far, far weaker than the weakest of those was."
3,For a follow-up to Baraka - not up to par...,"There isn't much to say, except for what the title owns...I was prepared to be impressed with this film, and instead found myself hanging on moments I thought would climax into actualizing sequences, like the ones Ron Fricke brilliantly reveals to us in Baraka.Each scene sequence (beautiful architecture and sculptures) instead had a less noticeable time lapse that slowly elapsed over a few hours with shadows and spots where the sun hits, alluding to the well made buildings of our ancestors and their ability to stand the tests of time.There is no doubt that Ron Fricke spent an immense amount of time filming these scenes from angles that best reflect the object / scene's best qualities,... which were aparent - beautiful and majestic - but as a follow up to the revealing and encapsulating Baraka, this film falls short."
1,Waste of time & money.,"Wow, what a poor production in Blue-ray. I'm sure it worked well in the immersion experience of IMAX but forget about this one on your home entertainment system. Silly time lapse sequences that are redundant. Reminded me of the '50s 3D movies with overkill of objects flying in your face. Music that is best described as infantile. Sounds like someone who got a new synthesizer for Christmas.Save your money."
2,"Pretty, but not engrossing","I had visions of Koyaanisqatsi when I heard about this DVD, and I've always loved time-lapse photography, so this seemed like a wonderful find. Upon seeing it, though, I found it was not what I was expecting.The photography is quite beautiful, but much of the film is of landscapes or ancient monuments having the sunlight change as it moves in the sky. Pretty, but it doesn't show me the world from a time perspective that seems unusual or foreign. The scenes of people and cities were much more fascinating, I thought (although my favorite scene is of the tide rushing in around the French monastery). You can see the pulse of a city or the frenetic motion of people that you simply can't discern at normal speed.This is probably a great movie in its original IMAX format, where the pretty scenery and cockpit-eye-view of navigating canyons would be very impressive, but on the small screen, it was not as engaging as I had hoped."
2,Redundant and short,"Having just seen Samsara, Baraka, and Koyaanasquatsi again I would say you can choose any of the others and get the experience. There is only so many hours of people moving fast, going up and down elevators, coming out of subways, automation, cars stopping and going, slow motion or fast motion of similar scenary, slaughterhouses, etc before you say he is plagiarizing himself. The video quality is deplorable by the way and 42 minutes is a rip-off. So pick one and you can skip the others unless you are a fan of time lapse films."
3,Great but very short,"Great film but very short compared to Baraka. Otherwise, an awesome film. It was a 4 star film but I deducted one star for brevity."
1,A total waste of time....,"I have to say that I had high expectations for this documental/movie,Even more so when I found out that it was made by the people who made Baraka. A total dissapointment. Just stayaway. Believe me."
1,I agree with Big Disappointment,"I purchased this DVD based on the good reviews and ignoring the one from Big Disappointment (which is the one I should have paid attention to). I agree completely that it's a hodge podge culmination of beautiful photo shots in time lapse photography that have no direction or make sense. I thought the DVD was going to have narration on the Chronology of the ""beginning"" of life here on this planet. It's not. At the end of it I thought to myself ""why did I buy this and why did I just waste an hour watching it"". I guess I kept waiting for it to make sense and to come together. I give it 1 star for the beautiful photography...but other than that it was a goofy DVD. If you're looking for a beautiful visual and interesting DVD, try ""The Coral Reef Adventure"""
2,Baraka's ugly cousin,"The movie itself is okay and seems a fine warm-up for Baraka, but there's no excuse for the abysmal transfer, a death blow for a film that's essentially a collection of stunning visuals. There's dirt visible on the screen and horrible blocking artifacts and mosquito noise throughout the film. And the audio sounds as bad as the video looks. It's hard to enjoy a film that looks and sounds this bad."
2,Good but no Baraka,This video is pretty good but now stands in the shadow of BARAKA. If you're looking for something very interesting and more polished check out BARAKA.
4,A journey in time.,"The cinematography was spectacular. The time lapse was unique and mesmerizing. I couldn't really catch the connection between the southwest desert scenes moving into European and Egyptian ruins. Also, the film seemed a little Euro-centric. There are many ruins that are just as spectacular in South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East to which this film ignored entirely. The sound track contained the equivalent of the musical content of Spam, consisting mainly of singular synthesizer lines weaving in and out of one another. It sounded entirely canned, with little interest to the musical ear."
2,Great movie but really bad HD-DVD,"I hope that the Blu-ray is better than this HD-DVD that is just an insult. 1080i (why ??? the HD-DVD supports 1080p), a horrible compression in mpeg2 (why ??? the HD-DVD supports the h264 and VC1 too), the picture is full of artifacts and very noisy. The worst, the transfer has been badly done, the picture is blinking. The sound is ok but I doubt it's a DTS HD.For a great movie like this, it's a shame than the AV technicians didn't understand the HD-DVD specifications..."
3,A half-step towards Baraka,"This disk is a beautiful conversion from Hi-def film onto HD Blu-ray, but the content is mostly lacking coherence. Great for pretty images and arresting time-lapse sequences, but I was hoping for something more. I remember it differently from when it first came out."
3,Great for a background...,"I bought this on HD-DVD based on the strength of others' reviews. I have to say...I'm a little disappointed (but not too much). The time lapse photography is breathtaking at times, the accompanying music is well matched. However, it has been approximately 25 years since this was made, and the visuals that were unbelievable in the 80s are far more commonplace today. The clarity is perfectly suited for 1080p HD, as is the rich soundtrack.Chronos provides great background visuals and music for a more formal dinner party of get together; it's not particularly fitting for ""let's go watch Chronos!"" As background or filler, it's great. As the main feature, it's a little slow and uninspiring for me."
4,Absolutely beautiful,"If you loved Baraka, Chronos is for you. A bit short, but then time lapse photography stays interesting only for so long. For those unfamiliar with Ron Fricke's work, you need to understand that he really makes moving pictures instead of movies. Imagine standing in a museum where the paintings come alive. If you want a movie with stories and actors, this will bore the living daylights out of you."
4,Great HD-DVD demo disc,"While not the film masterpiece that Koyannisquatsi is, this will do until that film is released on high definition. Because this was filmed in the large format IMAX you can't really get more high res than that. The imagery is quite stunning, with great color and detail. This is the disc to use if you want to show off your HD-DVD and hi def tv. Relatively inexpensive also for an HD-DVD."
2,I love this Imax original...but this Blu-ray disk is not up to par!,"I LOVE this movie....love it...but after watching it for 5 minutes, I realized that the transfer is just crap! Whomever did the compression from Imax film to Blu-ray should be fired. The amount of grain is almost too much to handle...and destroys the majesty of this film. Most of my SD DVD's look better...and this is Blu-ray! HD! Honestly...it's crap. If you want to see another film by this legendary director, get the Blu-ray of Baraka...the transfer to Blu-ray is the best out there....BY FAR!! I highly recommend it. I do not recommend this copy of Chronos...until they re-issue it with proper compression and transfer techniques."
2,Not for me. . .,"I didn't like this film. I have a good TV and DVD player but even they didn't make up for it. I recognized most of the places but still would have appreciated a bonus feature that allowed me to choose whether or not I wanted some kind of narrative. The photography was beautiful though. I don't know, call me thick but I just didn't see the point. And the music made me nervous. Couldn't wait for it to end."
3,Lisa Shaw - Cherry,"Lisa Shaw has lent her voice to some great tracks in the past, most notably her collaborations with Jay Denes' Blue Six project. Here, on her solo album CHERRY, she takes the main stage with production assistance from Mr. Denes himself and Eric Stamile. But it shares the same problems with other solo vocalist album on Naked Music: an over-emphasis on the downtempo soul, not enough on the musical aspects. Sure, the title track has a bit of the funk to keep it going, but other tracks aren't as distinguished. Somehow, it's trying too hard to be sultry, and despite Shaw's beautiful vocals, it isn't succeeding. ""Grown Apart"" is slightly more upbeat, and it shows by being catchier, as do the moodier sounds of ""Matter of Time"" and ""Always."" The Jimpster mix of ""Let It Ride"" has all the sexiness that the rest of the album lacks--perhaps house is the best genre to show off Shaw's ample talents."
3,Background Lounge CD,I saw Lisa live in San Diego recently and enjoyed the performance more than the CD. It is indeed a beautifully melodic album...
5,Perfectly chilled,"Like other reviewers have said, I waited for Lisa Shaw to release a cd for quite some time. I was really pleased to pick this up and hear that it is a nice mix of chillout music that is bluesy, electronic, and more. Her voice is beautiful and the music is very atmospheric and relaxing. Highlights include ""Matter of Time"", ""Push-button"", ""When I"", ""Always"", and many more. Great cd...be sure to pick it up!"
4,Smooth,"I got turn on to Ms. Shaw, a year ago when I download Pandora, to my phone. And, since then I been searching for some more of hear music."
4,Check out the remixes!,"If it's that Naked Music sound you're after, check out the Cherry remixes coming out Nov. 15. You can get them iTunes NOW! The Miguel Migs Salted Vocal remix ROCKS! Lisa's Cherry album is more mellow than the remixes, of course, but that voice...! Buy the album and curl up with your honey. You won't be sorry."
4,Well-Rounded Political Theory through the Ages,"A well-rounded book on political philosophy through the ages. It does a fairly good job of covering the classical tradition through modern times. It does a good job covering antiquity to the middle ages. My gripe is that the modern radicals get covered and their is virtually nothing from the American Founding Fathers or those who inspired the American Constitutional Republic (except John Locke.) Perhaps, something from Montesquieu and Madison could have been included.It is used for various Political Theory classes. Incidentally, I've acquired a great deal of the writings in this book beforehand and probably never spent as much as this text costs. Also, the bulk of these writings are available in the public domain, which makes one wonder why it is so expensive. Typical of most textooks, it is ridiculously expensive like all textbooks from the Cali Textbook Cartel."
5,Beautiful!,Nice addition to my kitchen. Perfect size and very good quality. Satin nickel is true to color match with the cabinet hardware and faucet.
2,BIG,"Is much bigger than appears in the picture. It is well made, but you have to want a really big fruit bowl to like this one."
1,NOT the original recordings!,"I am an enormous fan of B.B. King's early work -- I listen toit all the time. Don't be fooled by this CD: these are not theoriginal recordings they purport to be. In the late 60s, King's old label, Modern Records, wanted to cash in on his newfound popularity. They decided to reissue his early recordings, but they apparently thought that the sound quality was lacking. They overdubbed new bass, drum and horn parts onto them -- destroying the original character of the recordings, and making them all sound the same. This CD is a reissue of THAT release -- NOT of the originals. For a fantastic CD of the original, unadulterated cuts, get ""B.B. King: His First Two Original Albums on One CD"" on the Flair label. Amazon carries that one, too, and it's a 5-star CD!"
5,Happy addition,I have loved my Corelle Abundance set and am happy to have the gravy boat to finish off the set.
3,It does not come with a PS/2 adapter!,"The description claims it can hook to PS/2, which may be the case, however this is a little misleading because it does not come with the USB to PS/2 adapter, it only natively has a USB connection."
2,Redundant L.A. tale,I understand what they were trying to do here. Generation Xers deal with their cynicism as they try to make it as artists in a society which mostly doesn't care about artists until they become celebrities. The problem here is that even though they had a long list of names I found it repetitive of other such movies I've seen and it just dragged for me. MY GRADE: C minus to C.
1,THIS MOVIE DOESN'T LOAD,"THIS MOVIE DOESN'T LOAD. EVERYTIME I TRY TO WATCH A MOVIE, IT WON'T LOAD. THIS IS WEARING THIN. OH, WELL."
3,A Good Intro,"This work by Blackstone and Josipovic is an adequate introduction to Zen Buddhism with some nice history. When it gets into practice and study is where I stumbled. In the discussion of the koan, the authors read off a few that I am familiar with, but then this one, which I found strange they would include it:""One day he [Choa-chou] fell down in the snow and cried out ""Help me up, help me up!"" A monk ran over and lay down beside him. Choa-chou got up and walked away. (If you can guess who learned what in the above situation, you are doing better than the authors). pg 100I felt the authors should have left that out, for it made me suspicious of the rest of the book. A fun book otherwise and good for someone who knows a little more about Zen than just a beginner, for they will have a more refined view."
5,COUNTING TIME IN THE JUNGLE,".A beautiful little counting book. All our favourite animals are here.1 elephant, 2 giraffes, 3 gazelles, 4 hippos, 5 lion cubs, 6 zebras, 7 parrots, 8 crocodiles, 9 chimpanzees and 10 snakes.A really clever feature is the index tabs around the top and side of the book. There are ten tabs, each with a picture of a jungle animal. From the front cover you see one tab for each animal but as you open it up, page by page, the tabs get larger and larger, accommodating the number of animals in each scene. Of course on the last page we have ten snakes around the scene.A great way to get the young ones confidently counting up to 10.."
4,Did the manufacturing method change?,"These are the exact shoes I had a few years ago and wore them until they were worn out. They were so comfortable. This pair is not as comfortable. I have had a problem getting them 'worn in' and can't wear them for a full day.I still like the way they look, just wish my feet didn't hurt at the end of the day."
1,Not like th epicture,"These were horrible. Straps didn't stay in place, hard to walk in. I threw them away and couldn't even use them."
2,Dissapointing,"I love the Ancient Minchiate of Etruria deck by Lo Scarabeo, but unfortunately it's out of print, and any copies available are very expensive. I decided to settle for this deck, and unfortunately, I'm pretty disappointed in it. The artwork reminds me of pastel line drawings and I suppose art is subjective, but I don't care for it.The accompanying book is large and extensive with lots of research and history about the cards, while the actual divinatory meanings are usually left to one or two sentences. As if those few sentences weren't flimsy enough, the reverse meanings have also been completely left out. The author notes that he's leaving the reverse meanings up to you to figure out.If you're buying this tarot set because you're interested in the history of the minchiate, well, you wont be disappointed. But if you're buying it because you want to actually use the deck, there's much to be desired."
1,"Pagans, don't bother.","He worked hard, he did the research - and I don't care for it. The deck looks like it was done with Bic Bananas, and he's completely changed the Fool from the true fool he is on the old Minchiate decks, to what Barney would look like if he didn't wear a dinosaur suit. I already had the Lo Scarabeo Minchiate deck, and wanted to learn more. This book offers very little in the way of fresh, usable knowledge. The card interpretations have a fluffy, self-help-paperback tone to them. This is the Tarot equivalent of Ralph Blum's Book of Runes - which a lot of people liked, but many of us find to be too Christianised, too fluffy, just not very ""occult"". I gave him two stars only because he obviously made a huge effort. But a miss is as good as a mile."
3,Not for Visual People,"I must differ in the reviews mentioned here that say they like the book but not the cards. I think that while the minchiate is a lost art, and that this book expands the notions of what each card means, it does so in a very sketchy manner. The pictures are sketchy, the cards are sketchy, and the very descriptions of the cards are merely outlines.For one to get truly into the Minchiate, one must be a right-brained person. That is what this author has failed to recognise. At least provide color images, that is what we want, and cards that are artistically adept.Sorry to be so critical, but it's just a beef that I have with this book and deck. At this price, there *should* be color pictures, but there are none, so I feel left out in the cold in terms of artistic expression. Also, I didn't see any reversed meanings listed, which means one must make those up for one's self."
3,HUH?,"I must say I'm a little confused with this deck and the book. The book is informative but of what, I'm not sure. The cards are ok, nothing special.However; I decided to just jump in and ""did it my way"" so to speak. I was pleasantly surprised to have received a very informative and accurate reading.They say the first year is the hardest. I think we will grow on eachother."
3,"It's a beautiful deck, but...","I just received The Minchiate Tarot. It's a very beautiful deck, with lovely pastel artwork, and I was intrigued by the concept: a 97-card Renaissance Tarot, which includes the 12 astrological signs and cards for the four elements. But I have to admit to a huge disappointment. The deck, to me, has been ""deflowered"" in a way, missing The High Priestess and The Empress cards from the traditional Major Arcana, and replaced instead with The Grand Duke and The Western Emperor cards. Obviously, I'll need to work with them a bit to get a true feel, but the feminist in me really riles against the substitutions... it just feels wrong, and it feels like the deck has been purposely manipulated to exclude a feminine balance.But it is a beautiful deck..."
2,Dissapointing,"Was very dissapointed in this product. Recieved as a Christmas gift, not only does it not heat up water, it dosnt keep the warm water you put in warm for more then 4 mins! In no time your feet are freezing! A plastic pail would be better!"
1,No moving parts - you do all the work. Completely useless.,"NO MOVING PARTS contrary to depiction above. The ""attachments"" are tiny plastic 1.5"" knobs that attach to a motionless center peg over which you are supposed to rub your feet! They do not move. There is no massaging action - YOU DO ALL THE WORK, making your hips and knees sore. The ""massaging foot beds"" are totally motionless and form a spiky, painful surface. Vibration setting creates an annoying buzzing sensation over whole device. Jets are totally underpowered. No fill line indicator so ""Bubbles"" spill water onto floor. Heater is completely useless - after 15 minutes water temp was no different. Classic deception in advertising."
1,Completely Worthless,Completely Worthless....Does NOT have heat as advertised...Does NOT heat up water...You are required to fill unit with hot tape water...Water jets point at your ankles...Therefore does not massage your feet...Water splashes everywhere...Attachments are very cheap little plastic...The foot massage rolls that go in the bottom...You must move your feet back and fourth to get a massage at all...Cannot add foot solutions as this causes more water to splash all over your floor... I am throwing mine into the trash can...
1,I should have read the reviews here before I bought mine.,"The problem mentioned by other reviewers are all true. ""Heating"" is practically non-existent. I am very disappointed at this.I also found that the water splashes out a lot. Although I kept the initial water level to that instructed on the machine, after keeping the jet on for about ten minutes, half of the water had splashed out of the bath. I am going to see if I can return this tomorrow."
2,Conair FB51 Foot bath,"This model is not particularly powerful (jet pressure) in comparison to an older model by Conair (which is no longer available). The water does not 'heat' either. All in all, I was very disappointed in the unit."
2,"Nice footbath, but the bubbles cool the water","My wife really likes the attachments and style of the footbath, but when you turn on heat and bubble, it seems to cool the water in just a few minutes and not heat at all. I guess it is injecting air which is why it is cooling the water, so that seems to be a big flaw in the design."
1,Conair FB51 MASSAGING JET FOOT BATH,"If you just want somthing that bubbles around your feet ok, If you are looking to relax your tired feet this aint it!!!! I was disappointed when I came home from work and opened it up I used it once and put it back in box......Waste of MONEY!!!"
1,Not worth your money at all!,"This foot bath will probably give you stress rather than relax your feet. As mentioned by other reviewers, it does not warm water at all. You have to add the warm water. While the product claims to keep said warm water warm for a while, it will get cold within 5 minutes. Honestly, I think the machine cools the water. There are no moving parts, so to use all the attachments you have to move your foot over them. Another problem I've found is the particularly low maximum water level which leaves half my foot out of the foot bath. Even when you don't exceed the max water level line, a lot of the water is thrown out when using the bubbles function. As was also mentioned by other reviewers, the water jets are practically useless. The water is thrown at your ankles and I wouldn't use ""jet"" as a way to describe it... it is more like a water stream. Obviously, I was disappointed by this product."
3,"If you can keep the water hot, it'd be great!","With all of the nice add-ons to this footbath, it makes for a nice experience. After about 10 minutes, the water is too cold. The heater apparently does nothing -- not even to ""maintain"" water temperature."
1,absolutely waste... DO NOT BUY,got it from sears at a huge discount. Still felt I overpaid through the nose. It should not cost more than a dollar... if that...it is just a tiny bath (big enough for two adult feet) and has a power cord. With two nozzles that squirt water at idiotic speed.You do all the rest.
1,Heater doesnt work,Very disappointed -the heater is not working and it's overall of a poor quality. Should have read the reviews here before ordering and wasting 70dollars..
2,Mess,"Splashes a lot of water out, especially with the bubble function on. Place it on a towel or 2. Does not heat the water like it claims, if it does your toes will be prunes by the time it does. Just grab the towels and pour in hot water and it does ok, not worth the price tag in my opinion"
1,Not Available!!!,I actually cannot really review the actual product because it is unavailable. I ordered the product pictured above from Allegro Medical and received the usual order confirmation from Amazon and also one from Allegro stating I had ordered this product. Allegro took it upon themselves to ship me a different model without my consent and billed me for it. I contacted customer service via e-mail with no response. I called and they apologized and told me this model was unavailable. I informed them that it is wrong to advertise something unavailable and to substitute without customer consent. It has been like pulling teeth to get a return auth # and a prepaid shipping label. I see it is still listed as available and it is not so if you plan to buy this item wait for it to come available with another seller. Don't put yourself through the hassle.
2,heater doesn't work,"Other then that fact about the heater, I love how the jets and vibrator does work. for the money though the heater should be working."
2,Europeanized Chinese,"There ~are~ reasons to commend this book, like the bountiful illustrations, the charts showing the evolution of Chinese characters, etc. What I fault is that at many points the author departs from accuracy and injects over-Europeanized interpretations of Chinese mythology and symbols (for instance, characterizing Tibetan Lamas as ""devil-worshippers"" and calling the Chinese place of the dead and its god, ""Hades"" - repeatedly). To be truthful, some of the illustrations are so poorly drawn that you cannot really make out what they are. The text is easy to read and the topics covered numerous. I would use this book with caution, however, checking Williams' interpretations against other, more recent sources. For the record, I am giving this book a two because the only other reviewer to write about it gave it a five and that is far too high for it. I think this should yield an average of three, which is about right for this book."
1,just too many howlers,"Well, what do you expect from a scholar who doesn't even understand German? The author's only forte is endless musing on songtexts. Research? What on earth is that? The bibliography is full of books and articles that Youens has never read in her lifetime. That's all there is to say."
1,LARGEMOUTH BASS BOOK,"I CHOSED 1 STAR BECAUSE I WAS UNHAPPY WITH THE CONDITION OF THE BOOK.FIRST, I ORDERED A NEW BOOK AND THE BOOK I RECEIVED DID NOT SEEM TO BE NEWIT LOOKED LIKE SOMEONE HAD READ THE BOOK AND THERE WERE SCRATHES ON THE FRONT AND BACK COVER.HOWEVER, THE BOOK IF FILLED WITH GREAT FISHING TIPS."
5,Always awesome Art.,"If God were to choose a photographer to record his creations, I am sure he would pick Art Wolfe. Full of his standard great photos, a pleasure to look at."
1,A PATHETIC ATTEMPT TO STAEL THE BEATLES GLORY!!,"Next to Elvis, the Fab Four were the greatest music artist of the 20th century. The author tries his best to claim that they stole their songs from other artists. (like Motown). although they influenced them, he WAY OVERRATES their role in the Beatles' songs!Luckily, the author is unable to convince me or any sane person to respect the Fabs any less for their songs which defined the sixties and popular culture like no-one else apart from the King (Elvis).This book is not for a true fan of the Beatles, or a true fan of music."
4,Good collection,"Good collection, however, I would prefer a bit more innovation in the arrangements. Good service and quality CD. No one does anthologies...better than NPR"
5,Excellent CD's,"I wanted to address the review from the person who complained that there are no words on the CD. There are words but they are imbedded in the music so that you cannot hear them consciously, your brain hears the words in a different way. I have used several of Mind Design's CD's & have had great results. I have tried CD's from other company's & did not achieve any results from them. With this company the results have been very impressive, the last success is that I quit smoking after 40 years & believe me, I didn't want to & this along with other assistance techniques did the trick. Also, whenever I start craving cigs again, I listen to the Stop Smoking CD & the cravings go away. These CD's have really impressed me."
3,campy - yet fun,"hmmm, the ol' horror flick. You don't know whether to laugh or be scared at some points. Definitely entertaining, a bit disturbing, but a fun (or should I say scary) time to waste and to be reminded of simpler times"
2,american gothic,"I am big horror movie fan so this flick sat with me fairly well.It was kind of cornie but with Yvonne(lily munster)DeCarlo and a great actor in Rod Steiger it held my interest,also throw in Michael J Pollard who always plays an off the wall character and I guess that is what keeps this movie afloat."
2,Kinda Disappointed,"This movie was just o.k. Everyone gives it five stars, but i don't think it was that great. This is for those who like to watch ""horror"" movies that aren't really scary. There was blood, occasionally, but that doesn't make a movie scary. It was goofy-especially those children of theirs. All of the cast was killed off in a sudden, stupid manner, and for no reason. The movie was an hour and a half, but it ended before it began-the woman was still there after everything was over. Maybe they wanted to make it interesting-she waited for revenge-but it was just dull. It made me feel as though they just didn't have enough running time after they killed off everyone. This movie was o.k., because it was so silly. It gave me a couple of good laughs."
3,Get more for your money,"O'kay, I will be the first to agree that this is a good movie for what it is (b-grade cheesey 80's slasher flick). But where do they get the price from!?! $90 for this?!? Rent it at your local wierd video video store."
4,Alot more than I expected!,"Here is a total shocker, I didn't expect this to be a good film but it was. I was not waiting for this movie to finish or looking at the clock, I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Heres the story : Three couples are stranded on an unkown island when their plane breaks down, the island is inhabited by a strange demented family, they take shelter in the families home and what happens after is something they never expected! The characters in this are creepy and very weird! This is a good movie, it's not your every-day horror movie, this is something totally different! Oh, and YES there is blood!"
4,UNDERRATED LATE 80'S GEM ! Ya look'n fa goosebumps?Watch this flick!,"John Hough's 'AMERICAN GOTHIC' is a brilliant little creep-fest & one of my childhood favorites. To me this is truly one of the most underrated horror films of all time. Between the excellent camera work/directing,a thick storyline & some above average to excellent acting(for the genre)to a couple of goulish kills & most importantly the incredibly creepy atmosphere! as a horror fan there isn't much not to like about this classic. Horror fans i found this dvd version for chump change & although it doesn't have anything more than a menu the actual picture quality & sound was pretty damn good. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good disturbing scare!"
3,American Gothic,Just plain not bad. What's ironic is that I've been places on this Earth that remind me of these people on the Island. Yes it's worth your time and money. Count Wolfenstein
5,Very original!,"I've seen a lot of horror movies in my day, from White Zombie to The Shining to Scream (not really classified as an excelent horror movie in my book, but i wanted to put something a little more recent), and this one had a very original, and clever plot. That isnt exactlty easy to come by now-a-days. I have seen just about every horror movie out there, and this is a MUST see!"
3,ROD AND YVONNE BRING IT ON,The deliciously over the top performances of Rod Steiger and Yvonne DeCarlo as well as their looney offspring propel this 80s slasher into hybrid horror/comedy land.By today's standards GOTHIC is pretty tame but effective nonetheless. Few horror cliches are overlooked but the performances are so sincere you can forgive the use of these cliches.Not a classic but campy fun.
1,Poorly written.,"Instead of relating the actual story's details, the author just keeps repeating all of the statistics and information about the modeling and photography industries, over and over and over again through the entire book. He repeats the same information dozens of times, and really we are just craving information about this particular case. Very badly written. First bad review I have ever written in the reading of thousands of books, by the way."
5,"Wham, bam, crunch!",Lovers of the hard-boiled genre of crime fiction have something to cherish here. Steve Holland crafts an amazing overview of the British crime paperback as published in the days after World War II. A copy of this book belongs on the shelf with PAPERBACKS U.S.A.
1,Unimpressed,"I am disappointed in this cookbook. The recipes are either too simple (one sauce ""recipe"" is just canned cream soup and sour cream, and there's another ""recipe"" for asparagus with butter and salt) or too terribly unhealthy. We try to eat moderately, but this is over-the-top fatty for us. I would say that if you like to cook already, this book won't be enough of a kitchen workout, and if you like to eat healthy, you won't find much here. On the other hand, if you are just learning the very basics of cooking and don't care much about fat content or calories, then this might be the perfect book for you."
2,Trying to clog your family's arteries? This cookbook is for you!,"Having grown up around many Mormon families, I was excited to receive this cookbook and try out some of the recipes at our neighborhood potlucks. The book itself is beautiful, but the recipes are so unhealthy that it would be irresponsible to feed these finished dishes to families and friends. It's easy to make something fattening and unhealthy - which describes nearly everything in this cookbook - and I was hoping that the recipes would at least have been modified to make them healthier for today's lifestyles. I'm not a health food fanatic, and appreciate a fattening meal here and there, but this book is over-the-top in the ""what not to eat"" category. For me, there isn't much in this cookbook that sounds like it would be worth the trouble making."
2,A lot of fat in it...,"Our city library has this book, so I decided to check it out before buying it. The appearance of book is funny - it looks good on a shelf, but trying recipes from there? no way! Too much fat, oil, mayonnaise, sugar.I liked the Broccoli Salad recipe though :)"
5,Essential mormon Cook Book,This is a GREAT basic cook book. I give it as a shower or wedding gift. The feed back I have gotten from recipients is very positive. I have enjoyed making the Eclairs. They were a big hit. I especially liked the seasonal format. G Harrison
5,Great recipes that take little time!,"I love this cookbook! It has many of the recipes I remember when I was young plus ones I've enjoyed over the years at friends' homes. And the recipes are easy to follow, filled with ingredients I already have in my home, and they don't try to turn me into the next Martha Stewart. The author allows short cuts...which is the way I like to cook. These recipes have definitely passed my family's taste test, especially when they ask me to make the items again!"
5,Another Great Cult Classic !!!,"As with the original Legend of Boggy Creek,This sequel is just as much fun as the first. Thanks Amazon and friends !!!"
3,Boggy Creek II,"Look, it's easy to be critical of this sequel to the cult classic "" The Legend of Boggy Creek"", both were the artistic love childs of film maker Charles Pierce and are done in a documentary style that begs to be believed as authentic story telling. It is at all times entertaining and for the most part, not a bad re-dux. To get in the proper mood watch the original first and then the second as a double feature and you may like it more. Sadly this film fails to satisfy the fear we all want to feel at night in the woods when we hear a unknown sound in the dark and run screaming "" Bigfoot!!!""."
3,Nowere as good as the original,To truly enjoy this movie you MUST and i repeat MUST see the Mystery Science Theater 3000 (MST3K) version of this movie....it eliminates the whole mad dog part altogether.....but its HILARIOUS to watch on MST3K
4,movies,I bought this movie as a gift for my boyfriend he really enjoyed it he had been bugging me to order this one for a while and he watches it every other night
1,Boggy Creek 2,I do not recommend this DVD to buy. if you want to see it RENT it. The original Legend of Boggy Creek is totally different from this movie. The original was pretty scary. A lot of the information is pretty accurate I feel.
1,Thank God for Mystery Science Theater!,What more can I say? MST just does it all. I don't think I could have watched this movie without them!
1,peee uuuu,this is nothing but a old fart telling the story of the first movie. DVD makes a good coaster.
5,KRAVITZ IS THE KING !,"This album is great. Every song is unique and sounds awesome. I have a cassette in the car and cd at home. I cannot listen to it enough. My favorite songs are Fields of Joy and It Aint Over till its Over. And the guest performers are not bad either (Slash and Sean Ono Lennon). This is one of my all time favorite cds. It just rocks, funks, etc and gets better with every play."
3,this album first let me notice him,"it is a good album but not as good as are u going my way. i got his ablum because of it ain't over till its over. that song struck me and almost made me cry once.i could relate to it at the time it came out.stand out tricks are stand by my woman. number6,7 and 13. this album let u know there something special to come out of him like are u going my way.lenny almost go jazz on what goes around comes around and sound excellent.lyrical lenny is good. but not at his best yet instrumental. expermenited with some songs. they mostly work. but get it just for it ant over till its over classic lenny and lenny total understanding relationships and speacks likea marvin gaye lyrical on the song the difference is why"
3,"Lacks direction, but Lenny has a great voice.","My first Lenny Kravitz album was ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"", and at the time I bought that, the store clerk recommended ""Mama Said"". I finally bought it, and was disappointed. I had come to expect musical sensitivity, discernible melodies, and music that is easy on the ears. I did not find that on ""Mama Said"". Instead, I got grinding guitars, not a small amount of wailing, and a general lack of harmoniousness. However, I love Lenny's voice, and his style, and I really enjoyed ""It Ain't Over"" and ""Stand By My Woman"", which are more what I expect. I greatly prefer ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" to this CD, though those who want a harder, more driven edge may appreciate ""Mama Said""."
5,It's All Good,"This album is one of the best I've ever heard. It mostly has songs written about his breakup with Lisa Bonet, and they really touch your heart. In many of these songs, Lenny sings in a really high voice, so this isn't exactly one of those albums you'd sing along to. Nevertheless, 'Mama Said' is beautiful and is definitely pure Lenny. There are songs to rock to, songs that make you cry, and definitely songs that you can relate to your own life. 'Mama Said' is always going to be one of my favorites."
5,The start of my music life,"This cd is by far my favourite one.I bought it when I was 13,my life changed since that moment. It aint over til it's over is such a WONDERFUL song.Everytime i hear it I feel like flying in Lenny's voice,It's the perfect meaning of loving someone,it's a song that came from the bottom of Lenny's hart.I feel very gratefull for hearing that song.If i had never heard that song I would probably be listening to stupid bands like Blink 182, etc.Of course the Cd has other terrific songs such as Fields of Joy, Always on the Run,All I ever wanted, etc. I totally reccomend you to buy this Album, a mix of Love depression and lonelines that touches me."
2,No Melodies,Got both I and II for Christmas and was disappointed. The harp pieces seem random with no discernable melody lines. It's quiet but not very soothing.
4,not one of her best,"Although I enjoyed the book, I don't feel it was one of her better efforts. I didn't find the story line that appealing or exciting but I like reading stories about the Boston area and the like Carlotta a lot !"
2,a real disapointment,I was very disapointed with this book. It came highly recommended. I loved Ms. Barnes' other books. This one was a bore!
3,An enjoyable weekend read.,"This is the first book I have read by Linda Barnes. It was a good story with some surprising plot twists. It wasn't so suspenseful that it kept me glued to the book, but the author did a great job of portraying your average dysfunctional wealthy family. The female P.I. (ex-cop) protagonist, Carlotta Carlyle, doesn't come in with guns ablazing, but she gets the job done (sometimes quite humorously)."
2,the long journey is not up tp the destination,The ending was the same as so many other books along the same line that I was sorely disappointed. Especially because there were many opportunities for it to turn into something a little less predictable. A saving grace was CJ Critt's narration. )I listened to BOT). It almost made the characters interesting. This was my first Carlotta Carlyle mystery and probably my last.
3,here's a brilliant Idea no one ever thinks of but should,"Why not just skip the computer altogether and go directly to the printer. If you are a budding novelist or have delecate essays on this thing, why would you want them on your PC's dirty Hard disk anyway. Why not skip the hackers and flaky Windows Operating systems and go strait to the printer or better yet, print it out on this device. In this day and age at this price, you should be able to do that at LEAST."
2,Broke after first use,"The two bars cracked after my first day of using them for stradle press pikes, hollow push ups, and hand stands. I don't know if it is just this pair however the product cracked the first day of use."
5,Got me started in programing,"When I was in 5th grade I got this at a book fair. I never became a professional programmer but throughout college I was making bank doing it on the side. I know its old, and there are probably newer flashier programs out there, but its still great. I recommend it for anyone who wants to learn."
4,"My ""Punto de vista""","This album is not one of my favorites, but contains 2 songs that hit the spot. The track ""Perdoname"" is my personal favorite and anyone that follows Gilbertos salsa will either say that Mr. Santa Rosa's ""Perdaname"" is their absolute favorite or know someone that will stand by that song 100%. The track ""Vivir sin ella"" Delivers beautifully with the sad/romantic lirycs. For those that love collecting great cd's, I recommend that they buy the double cd of Gilbertos Carnagie Hall presentation. Again, the ""perdaname"" track is going to BLOW YOU AWAY. The man improvises like a God and keeps it going and going and going and goi......"
3,About family and love,"Billy Crystal's ""700 Sundays"" was mostly about him growing up in Long Beach and how he became very close to his dad. Unfortunately, his dad died when he was only fifteen and he calculated that, it would be roughly 700 Sundays that he managed to spend with his dad. They used to attend baseball games together, listening to jazz, watching shows, and among other things. You can tell that he has the utmost respect for his dad and his mom too. Crystal also wrote about how he got started in comedy but he did not dwell too much about it as the focus of this book was mainly about his family.I have never seen Billy Crystal's act on Broadway and I have no doubt that it was good. Unfortunately, I don't think putting his act into a book has quite the same effect. I don't think it is worth paying a retail price for it but if you are a huge fan of Billy Crystal and wants to know more about the personal side of him, then this may be the book for you."
3,A THUMBNAIL SKETCH OF A LIFE,"There were plenty of jokes in this book where some worked and some didn't. Though this is information taken from a stage piece of Billy's, (which I was unaware of) it is not a true memoir, i.e. it is slim pickins' of a detailed life. Billy Crystal is one of our finest comedians, however, his text creation is not its equal. I am sure there will eventually be a book that could be called a full fledged biography."
1,"I Get It, He's A Jew!!!","That's not supposed to be anti-Semitic by the way.... I absolutely hated this book. I bought it thinking it would make me laugh, unfortunately only one part made me laugh (punching a guy in the balls during a basketball game - good stuff) other then that it was a pretty boring book in my opinion. While some of the stories were neat, a lot of it just got plain annoying. There seemed to be too many parts where Crystal tried to throw in some random stand-up material that had nothing to do with anything.As far as the ""I get it, he's a Jew"" statement I had above... I've got no problem with Billy Crystal, and I've got no problem that he's Jewish but dear God does he need to mention it on every page!? That was almost as annoying as the random tangents!"
4,Unique autobiographical work,"I would read and laugh. A few pages later, I would tear-up. Billy was blessed with a wonderful, talented and beautiful family. I just loved this book, the format, the perspective, the photos and the stories. It is a quick, easy, and enjoyable read. I would most certainly have given it a ""5-star"" rating had it not been for the occasional yet totally unnecessary bad language inserted into the text(including the ""F"" word).Dr. Stanley E. Toompas, Optometrist& Author of ""I'm the One the Other Isn't, Books 1 & 2"""
5,Great Book,"This book is not just a book for comedy fans. It is a great book for anyone who wants to hear a great true story. Funny at times, touching at times, Crystal did a great job."
3,love Billy Crystal,Funny but moderate use of inappropriate language and stories. Too bad. This could have really been a book I could recommend.
4,Funny and touching,"Found this at the library, never heard of the broadway show, loved the book. A quick, easy and pleasant read that nonetheless has some very solid moments, and plenty of laughs.Crystal is just plain funny, and he can make fun of his oy-so-Jewish family in a million hilarious ways. His Aunt Sheila's phone speech about her lesbian daughter's wedding is by itself worth reading this book for.The best surprise for me were the Milt Gabler jazz tales; had no idea Billy was part of the Commodore story. Imagine going to see Shane on a Sunday with Billie Holiday. Unreal.Tons of great lines, some very touching and sad moments, and Crystal's unique comedic genius make this a winner."
4,Good book on Crystal's life,"I received this book as a gift and have enjoyed Billy Crystal's career, so I looked forward to reading it. Crystal's childhood was very colorful both with his relatives and his exposure to some of the greatest jazz musicians of their day. His account is funny and a quick read. I have to say I wasn't a fan of the many ""f-word"" expletives which sometimes detracted from the stories but, all in all, I'm glad I read this book."
4,Lost In Translation,"Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to see the Broadway presentation of '700 Sundays'. Based on the book version, I can imagine that as a one man show, starring the extremely talented Billy Crystal, this was both a funny and sad, heart tugging and poignant performance. However, only some of these elements come through in the text version, particularly Billy's warm memories of his mom and dad. Although I enjoyed the book very much, reading it makes me even more mad at myself for not seeing the play. For example, there were only a few times I found myself laughing.What must have been hilarious in the theater with an audience reacting to Billy's stories, enhanced by his humorous mannerisms, gift for mimicry and overall 'schtick' for the most part doesn't come through in the book. Still and all, '700 Sundays' is an entertaining and oftentimes moving memoir."
4,"Quick, witty, and heart-tugging memoir...","Mr. Crystal and I have several things in common: I am only about four years older, both of us grew up about an hour from Manhattan, both of us like jazz, and boy, both of us are funny. Of course, our differences are legion, but who cares? This book is a spin-off of his recent stage show of autobiographical tales, and if you like Billy at all, it is worth reading. He came from a family filled with characters, some of whom were personal friends of the best jazz players of the Forties and Fifties. His parents had a good marriage, his dad was a hard-worker but a nice guy, and dad's unexpected death when Billy was only 15 was devastating for the family. Despite that tragic event, most of this short book is sweet and humorous. Way to go, Bill."
3,"safe, maybe too safe and hard to clean","I disagree with any of the reviewers that felt the fork was too sharp. Our 13 month old is fairly skilled in stabbing food on her tray with a fork and getting it to her mouth. I bought this set when the stainless, plastic & rubber utensils started to degrade after years of use by our now 4 year old. I figured bamboo was ecologically responsible and simultaneously health safe for our kids. Unfortunately, as attractive as these are, the fork is pretty much useless. Even my husband and I have to use considerable force to stab a piece of food. And when you can manage to get food with the fork, it's very difficult to clean in between the tines. I'm looking for a better alternative. (And the kids' set isn't any sharper.)"
4,No plasticware!,"The spoon of this set is perfect for little ones- not too much volume in the payload area, and a good shape. I haven't tried the fork, but it seems like it would be able to spear or pierce soft foods (cooked veggies like potato, pumpkin, etc) but I don't know about harder foods like a veggie with a membrane or meat. The handles are curved and seem to be a good shape for little hands, and don't seem flimsy. They are meant to be handwashed, so those who say they splinter may be treating them roughly- mine are ok after months."
3,Difficult to say the least. Not for children.,This is not a puzzle for a child like you say in your advertisment.Even an adult will have trouble. I bought this for a 13yr old and we worked on it together but he soon became frustrated as did I. I think this could be very educational if you would make a few changes.The little cardboard layout guide you include is really no help at all. It is nearly impossible to read what some of the writing is on the pieces.1. Include a large map of the world as a guide.2. Include a magnifying glass.3. Include a tool to get the last of the puzzle to fit without wrecking the whole thing doing it.
4,An Excellent First Novel,"""The Assassin's Dream"" is a wonderful first novel for Mr. J. D. Townsend. It is engaging, full of excitement, and an unending suspense that makes it difficult to stop reading.The story takes place in a far distant future, in a world ruled by women and a culture dedicated to genetic engineering. Mr. Townsend's plot, and our heroine - the assassin, challenge the dictates of the closely ruled society only to leave us uncomfortably questioning until the end both the wisdom of genetic engineering and its 22nd century opposite.Mr. Townsend has crafted a tale that is hopefully not prescient of our future civilization as we begin to toy with our DNA, yet it seems poignantly suggestive of a Pandora's Box from which there is no retreat left in a world that has lost all touch with nature. Both those who engineer, and those who do not, may know too much to recover the natural order of things."
5,GREAT,"I live in this part of the country, I didn't know there was no much great places to stay here! Thank you! I know lots of places to get away! I just need that special someone! :)"
5,"Timeless standards, how refreshing!","""The mark of a man"" is a superb book. God's standards for manhood are presented for men and women to read. The book reveals that true manhood is attainable and realistic. Nowadays, the mark between men and women is blurred. This book reafirms the divine difference of men from women. A refreshment in the midst of the confusion."
5,Highly Recommended,I would definitely recommend this book for any men who wish for a great aid in attaining true masculinity. I will be sending it to my beau for him to read
4,Solid book for young men,"The parents of the girl I'm dating asked me to read this. Having read some of her other works, I was very willing to. I think it is an excellent book for young men with many truths and practical applications that could help a male be more of the type of man God designed him to be. I thought it had several points that young females could benefit from, either for themselves or to help evaluate potential suitors.There are probably some subtle doctrinal differences I would have with Mrs. Elliot, but they are minor enough to not negate the good and needed exhortation in this book"
5,Excellent and to the point,"This was my first book about design. To the point, the book discusses the four basic principles of design with good/bad examples to make his point: contrast, repetition, alignment and proximity. It's an easy read and will provide the nessary foundation to move on to more advanced material."
4,A fun way to test your sense of style,"Not getting the response you hope for from that poster in the window? Maybe you need to check your design... This book is key for anyone who was not born with the style gene, like me! The ""What Not To Wear"" for publication design. It is essential for anyone dealing with public relations and advertisement - even if it is a resume or business card. Excellent resource for beginning Web developers or anyone involved with graphic layout. Highly recommended for audiences middle school and up."
5,Most have for novice designers,"I'm a self-publisher and create my own marketing materials. After reading Robin William's book, I re-did and entire marketing kit and the transformation was remarkable.Before, for creative design inspiration, I looked at marketing design books that basically showed professional brochures. Williams gives you the tools you need to dissect those professional marketing materials so that you can go and create your own outstanding package.In four simple steps, she explains how to use the elements of design: proximity, alignment, repetition and contrast. Read this book and you will never look at marketing materials the same, ever. Before, I just did ""what looked pretty"" on paper. Now I create sophisticated prints that deliver a clear message."
4,Design demystified,Writers who want to improve the look of whatever they write will find some excellent information here. This book will also suit anyone who wants to understand the basics of graphic design. Williams' engaging writing style makes this both an entertaining and useful read. Make sure you do the exercises and quizzes - they're fun and extremely helpful.
5,pretty cool,"Very basic infomation for the total novice. I was never sure why my designs always looked off, especially when dealing with fonts, but i feel this book was a great start off point. It's a fast read and will get you ready quickly to begin reading more complicated design books."
4,"Simple, but complete",This book is easy to read and you get the point quickly. It covers essential topics and is a great basic design book.
1,DEFECTIVE PRINT RUN,"This book seems totally great-- I got my copy and found the material useful and engaging. BUT the copy I got from Amazon had pages missing and pages repeated in the book-- a printing error that means I'm missing a huge chunk of the middle of the book. I returned the book as defective, and the new copy I was sent had the exact same problem! I would suggest that you NOT order this book from Amazon, since there seems to be a problem with their print run. Buy it in a bookshop to ensure that you get all the pages."
5,Very Good!,"This book is being used as a textbook for one of my classes. It is very easy to read and understand. The book gives good examples of the information that it talks about and it is very clear. It is very helpful in understanding what makes a design good, eye-catching, and well-planned."
4,Nice and straight forward,"I thought this book was a nice and easy introduction to the art of layout and typeface selection. I am a software developer, and I felt that this book really was aimed at non-designers like myself. No fancy design jargon, just the basics.Jon A"
5,useful,I'm in my fourth year of college to become a graphic designer. I actually found this book to be helpful because of its little reminders. She also talks about design do's and donts that most people probably wouldn't even think about. She definently makes it easy for someone who doesn't know anything about design.I would also recomend her book The mac is not a typewriter.
4,Does What It Intends To Do.,"This book is subtitled ""A Guidebook for a TV-Free Week"" and rightly so, because that is exactly what it is. I do not watch much television to begin with and have spent many weeks television free. However, I agree with the challenge presented in the book that as Americans we spend way too much time watching televsion and that we should spend at least one week television free. I have known for some time that much of television is a void. However, even I was challenged by some of the observations the book makes. The only negative comment is that the book is rather short and does not expand upon some of the issues it raises. Of course, that is why it is a guidebook. Overall, a wonderful book that can help a person or family spend at least one week of their lives televsion free."
3,Good for those new to JKD.,"Rather than this book the ones written by Dan Inosato are highly recommended to experienced martial artists. This book, however, is good introduction to one of the main JKD phylosophy ""Use no way as a way, no method as a method."" This book is suitable for those not familiar with JKD concepts."
2,waste of money,"1) This book is very short. It's even shorter since some of it is stuff like telling you were to look on the internet for more information (so if you don't know how to use google maybe its helpful).2) I didn't find much insight here, it's mostly showing how literary terms like ""politicizing the aesthetic"" and ""aestheticizing the political"" relate to the book. I don't find it added to my understanding of Underworld.3) There are tons of typos in this book.It basically reads like some college student's senior thesis that they turned in without even proofreading. Don't buy it. It exists for one purpose only - to get your money. Just my opinion, the other reviewers seemed to think it was good, but that wasn't my experience."
5,Recommended for my Great Dane Puppy,This is an additive to the diet for my Great Dane Puppy. He was knuckling out a little due to too high a protein diet. The Great Dane Lady recommended a different dog food along with the addition of the K9 Lervel Glucosamine. His little leg were perfectly corrected in five days. Protein levels for puppies should never be over about 22 per cent. He's now six months old and moving like a show dog.
5,Seems To Help and Make My Dog Move Easier,"I have used this product on and off for several years and find that when my dog is using this product on top of food, that she is able to move easier and does feel better. A friend recommended this product and swears by it."
2,Not impressed.,My 3 yr old rottweiler started limping on his front paws a few months ago & was eventually diagnosed with elbow dysplasia. I rested him as directed by the vet & even tried 2 anti-inflammatories w/no improvement. Surgery is a last resort so I started researching glucosamine products. A lot of the reviewers of this products had much older dogs & seemed to have great results so I went with this product.Unfortunately I'm not impressed. The product took forever to come & didn't come in the stated time frame. I've been giving it faithfully twice a day (this is the start of the 4th wk) & no improvement with his limping. He doesn't care for the taste one bit so I literally have to give it to him w/a syringe (which is a small price to pay if it improved or stopped the limping). I will finish the bottle but if no difference is noticed I plan on trying the Bellyrubs brand. I just might have to consider surgery afterall.
3,An ok book but not for the beginner,"This book has a well written chapter on the economics of foreign exchange. This books' chapters on e-foreign exchange and innovations in e-fx are rather useless for the beginner and also outdated.The chapters on technical analysis and the individual trainer are short and to the point. It's good information but not enough 'meat' to assist the individual to make better trades. More or the same information can be found in other books that also explain in more details.There are several chapters that are mainly written for large institutional traders which I didnt find very useful other than getting a 'birds-eye' view from their position.In my opinion, this book is more for intermediate traders but I wouldn't recommend it to beginners."
3,good watch - annoying battery replacement,"Victorinox makes a good, servicable watch - my husband and I each have one & use them for hiking, canoeing, camping, etc. The problem that I have with them is that when the battery needs to be replaced, the watch must be sent to an authorized Swiss Army service center. There is only one of these in the US, so you will not have a local one unless you live in Connecticut. This can take 4-6 weeks, and is rather pricey (over $20 the last time I had mine serviced). The orginal battery lasted for several years, but the replacement battery less than one year. I've tried several local jewelers, but they all say they can't open it.Rather than being without my watch for a month or so a year, I intend to just replace the watch."
5,It's a great series,It helped complete the set of books I had already purchased. I enjoyed the series and have ordered books from the next series
1,Warped,"This baton seemed like a deal, but it really isn't. it was warped before i took it out of the wrapper and just got worse and worse. The handle is way too large and feels like a wooden toy. If you're looking for a cheap baton, look at the King Davids. They're pretty cheap and much better quality. It was definitely worth an extra 2 bucks to go to another brand."
4,Ziggy Marley's Jahmeka,This compilation has some of his best music. The quality and sound recording was excellent and still is despite the age of the cd.The cd quality still stands out.
3,Not for the inexperienced,"This is a special model for me, as I have always been an admirer of the Lafayette Escadrille. This model was fun, but some of the parts didn't fit and lock simply because there were no male-female couplings. So - not for the first timer. Finished product looks decent. Fun model."
2,What happened to the packaging?,"When I opened All Dogs Go To Heaven the plastic on the case has been completely warped. I am very disappointed considering I paid full price and waited over two weeks to receive it. I was expecting higher quality since I purchased it directly from Amazon. I followed up by writing a packaging review, hopefully this is an issue that Amazon will be able to fix in the future. Other than that, the disc is in great quality and this movie is a family favorite for us!"
5,Perfect,I ordered this DVD for my sister for Christmas. This movie has always been one of my favorites and we wanted to add it to our collection. The DVD and packaging was perfect.
5,Love this movie!!,"Somebody bought this movie for me on VHS when I was a child because they knew I loved dogs and thought I would enjoy it. I didn't just enjoy it, I loved it so much I watched it nearly every day. I also named my stuffed animal German Shephard after the main character, Charlie. Then when my family got a dog, I named him Charlie as well. I grew up, and VHS tapes became obsolete, so I bought this movie on DVD - and I still love it! Like many animated films intended for children, it does contain some more ""adult"" references here and there, but they are very subtle and I did not pick up on them until I watched this movie as an adult. I think these moments are thrown in for parents like mine with kids like me who want to watch the same movie over and over and over... It makes the movie relatable and entertaining for all ages. I can't wait to watch this movie with my own children someday."
1,Misleading title,"With the issue of cover's subtle bestiality andhomosexuality aside, having a halo above one'shead doesn't mean that you're on the narrow path.Psalm 22:16For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of thewicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands andmy feet.Philippians 3:2Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware ofthe concision.Revelation 22:15For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers,and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth andmaketh a lie."
4,"Wonderful film, a story of love and redemption","Although the music is not as good as it should be and the crocodile bit comes out of nowhere, this is wonderful movie that breaks out of the Disney cookie cutter mold. This story of the redemption of Charlie, who starts out as a selfish mobster-dog but learns the true meaning of love and selfsacrifice, is fun, funny, moving and uplifting. Adults and kids will enjoy it again and again!"
5,one of my favorites,"All Dogs Go to Heaven is absolutely one of my all time favs. as a kid growing up. This movie made me love dogs even more,lol. seeing this movie for this price just made it even better to buy now. I have a 13 month old daughter, and i wanted to have a lot of the old cartoon movies i loved as a kid. This movie was on top of that list. Im sure most people have already seen this movie, but for those of you that haven't this movie is one to grab right away.I loved it as a kid, and i love it even more as an adult. All i have to say is GET THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Classic!,"This is the classic ""All dogs go to Heaven"" movie. I loved it when i was a kid, and still do."
5,A great classic,"I loved this movie as a kid and it still holds up. I probably have watched it over 25 times. It may be dark for some kids, but some kids can handle it. At least give it a chance."
2,Not for younger kids,"This movie has absolutely NO appeal for my 3 year old daughter. We got it because she liked the ""doggies"" on the dvd cover, but she has barely watched 15 minutes of it before she is bored. I have to admit, Mommy doesn't much care for it either, it's just too dark."
1,Another Don Bluth classic attacked by idiotic publishers.,"Although the songs hurt this otherwise wonderful story, this was one of my favorite movies as a child and remains so to this day. Although I didn't appreciate the extremely dark tone of the movie at the time, I certainly do now. Keep that in mind: this is not your typical children's movie. The lead character is gunned down in the first segment of the film, for instance.The assault on Don Bluth's wondrous work continues with this DVD, which is totally devoid of the extras it deserves (widescreen and commentary, to name a few). As if that wasn't enough, they went to no trouble at all to restore the movie; indeed, the local library's old VHS copy looks and sounds better by leaps and bounds! Don't buy this release of the movie, wait for something better."
1,"Terrible movie for youngesters: gambling, smoking and lies","This movie shows the youngesters a terrible world where the place in focus is a bar with drinking, smoking, then gambling and dirty lies. The subject is too intense for young viewers."
2,"Nice Educational Tool, but too Pricey in the end.","While the cards presented a wonderful learning tool for my granddaughter, the cost of each bundle was too cost-prohibitive in the end. They are over priced to be sure. There are far less expensive alternatives out there. I would not recommend getting involved with this headache."
2,Don't sign up,"While the cards are nice and my daughter has enjoyed collecting them, I recommend staying away from this company. Their ""customer service"" is horrendous, the way they bill is shifty at best (I started writing down the package numbers and found them billing more than once for the same shipments), and just try canceling - good luck. Awful. Buy a set from a friend whose kids have moved on and save yourself the headache of dealing with IMP Online."
1,Horrible Customer Service,"UGH. I got the free thing, I didn't realize how much was in this thing, they put me on hold for over an HOUR so I eventually was forced to hang up because my phone was going to die. I'm only paying 2.50 a pack (I think), so I'm hoping eventually this will be done and I won't have to keep going on this bullcrap. I think there's 12 packs to be sent in the thing I got, that I don't even want anymore. We have to pay though, or we'll likely get in trouble. They're worth the money, but if you don't have the money for ALL of the things (at least 12 I believe) do NOT go through the ""free"" mail send in."
1,Way to expensive in the end,I am about to cancel our subscription........... I was just informed that if we take the 3 shipments in one to speed things along that I'll still have '''''28''''' more shipments to go putting the total amount OVER $700.......WAY to expensive.....we'll just put that money towards her college fund........
3,Something for animal enthusiasts,"Okay, this is an incomplete set!I got a promo package in the mail to buy these. And I couldn't afford the rest of them or the binder that sorts them. But they are sooo informational! I love them! Each ""card"" (which is more like a four page pamphlet) is full of basic facts about the featured animal. Geography, diet, physical attributes, and even colorful photographs give readers a general overview of the animal. The only pages I have for the set arebelow by animal.Bengal TigerPolar BearCoyoteLionVampire BatOrcaBald EagleCheetahGrizzly BearNile CrocodileGreat White SharkKing Cobra"
3,Okay,I have made about 22 or so disks. Not yet a single coaster made. This disk does get a little worse in picture quality toward the middle of the disk. BEWARE
4,"Very creppy, atmospheric, tension filled horror novel!!","I very much enjoyed reading Bad Things. Love the greenjacks idea, Robin's character, Dakota and the old house with all the secret tunnels. My one negative is Rick's character - he was way too passive and it didn't seem realistic that it would take him so long to figure out he can truly see the Greenjacks. And he was so depressive and down on himself. I understand that the author really wanted us to feel bad for Rick's childhood and all the abuse he suffered...but at times it felt like overkill. However, the overall story was great and I loved all the ""little"" happenings in and around the house that contributed to the overall sense of dread and creepiness. I'm definitely going to pick up additional books from Tamara Thorne!"
2,slooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow,"the plot was interesting enough. and the opening was ok, though it could have been better. no problems in writing style, except i couldn't really respect some of the psychological changes. but then, we are taken to ""today"". and now we are talking little suspence. too little things are happening, T dwelling at some really irrelevant details, or making the plot go too slow. and that is first and foremost what this book is: sloooooooow. i couldn't believe how little was going on. ""did i see something spooky?"" asked after 60 pages or something, that's slower than any other horror i've read (this is counting from ""today"").anyway, don't read this if you don't care for slow novels."
3,umm...,"Hey you know what? this is a great book. i just don't like it when authors give a previous book a different name n try to pretend it's new just to line their pockets a little more. i think they should actually write NEW books! good plan huh? but hey curry, errrr thorne i mean, don't ""panic""....have a nice day!"
4,Hometown Boy Does Well,"Great initial work by an artist who had a lot of music in him long before this album was made. You can see some of his developmental influences in his musical choices. (Look, I grew up with the guy!) Way to go T.D."
1,ROOM FOR A SANDWICH,I thought this thing would be the size of a compass that most people would carry but it was huge. I am sure I can fit at least 3 compasses in this thing. I work in the woods alot and it is built pretty light duty. I would return it if it didnt take more to send it back than it cost in the first place.
3,old school carryall,"This item works as advertised, with big stretchy belt loops. It does not protect against bumps. I would not trust it for highly active hiking.Although my version is all black, it is still not very sexy."
4,CAGE is good,"This is a really cool movie. Lots of action, a good story, and yes, even decent acting. I rented it because I have been watching ""The Incredible Hulk"". Lou Ferrigno and Reb Brown play two Vietnam vets. Lou saved Reb's life, and got shot in the head. The injury left him a simpleton, and Brown becomes his big brother/caretaker. Then some cage fight promoters get their hands on Lou, and Reb has to save him from the cage fights. It's really good, I'm telling you. Ignore the bad reviews on imdb. If you like action, cage is for you."
2,Should be under comedy,Unfortunately they took full advantage of Lou's disability. What's worse is he allowed it.It does provide some great sound bites when for tapes or radio.
3,Princeton Guide to Advanced Physics,"This would be a very useful book if it were not for the surprisingly large number of errors. A little more care is required to produce an updated and corrected edition. A new edition to eliminate typos, errors in derivations, and to provide a lttle more explanation where necessary, would render the book very useful to students and professionals alike."
4,Good Product,Good Product no complaints. nothing special but it works fine for the job. Seems to be a good finish on the chrome.
5,Perfect Book For a Young NASCAR Fan,"I had a hard time finding a good book about NASCAR for my son when he turned 5. He's a huge fan. This book is perfect.He's going on 7 now and still enjoys this book. It has lots of great photos of real cars and drivers - not generic painted race cars that a fan wouldn't recognize. It has photos of the pit crew action, the tracks, actual racing photos, the parts of the cars and lots of driver and car photos that your child will love. Some of the drivers and cars included are jeff Gordon, Tony Stewart, Jimmie Johnson, and Matt Kenseth. Great book for a 4 - 8 year old fan. The design is neat, too with the rubber handle with the NASCAR logo, and because it's a board book it can be carried around and looked at over and over again without getting damaged! Great gift for a true fan - your child won't be disappointed."
3,My son's best friend,"My 18 month old son has slept with this puppy since he was first born. He loves to hug Blue (as we call him; how imaginative), chew on his ears, and he cannot fall asleep without Blue on his chest. This stuffed puppy is very soft and cuddly and the perfect size for little hands. We bought three more of these guys because we expect that we will definitely need them, just in case one gets lost or is in the wash. They are very easy to clean but do get a little beat up looking, but each one has held up remarkably well even after 20 washes."
3,"My baby's ""lovey""","We were given this doll as a gift when my son was born. It was the first stuffed animal we gave him to sleep with when we started putting him to sleep in his crib by himself at 4 months. He is now 11 months old, and is still comforted by it every night. He goes to bed hugging it. This toy is very soft and small enough where we felt ok about putting it in his crib for comfort. I actually just went out and bought another one just to have when I am washing the first one. It's a great first stuffed animal"
4,Makes a great lovey,We bought this toy to help our son relax when he was upset. He took right to it becouse it is so soft and easy to hold.One of the things I like best about it is that I can wash it and dry it over and over and it comes out looking like new. I even use bleach on it. This is a big plus for any small childs toy but especially so for a child with asthma.
5,MY SON LOVES THIS STUFFED ANIMAL,"THIS IS BY FAR MY SON'S FAVORITE STUFFED ANIMAL. HE HAS HAD IT SINCE HE WAS A FEW MONTHS OLD AND HE IS NOW OVER 3. HIS ""DOGGY"" IS HIS BEST FRIEND. IT IS HIS COMPANION DURING THE DAY AT HOME AND IN THE CAR. HE SLEEPS WITH IT EVERY NIGHT. WE OWN THREE OF THEM WHICH WE ROTATE SO THEY ALL SEEM TO BE WORN THE SAME (HE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, THOUGH HE DOES IF IT IS ""NEW"" ONE). WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT. IT IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR AN INFANT, VERY SOFT LIKE A LITTLE PILLOW AND HAS NO REMOVAL EYES, ETC. AS A TODDLER IT IS PERFECT SIZE FOR HIM TO CARRY AROUND AND STILL CUDDLE WITH."
2,CUTE BUT SMALL,This puppy is very cute but it is much smaller than the picture makes it look. It is just a bit larger than a beannie baby animal. I'm not saying thats a bad size but I didn't want any one else suprised the way I was.
3,Not the one that used to be in the store.,"I do like the my first puppy line, however this is not the one that Babies'R'Us used to carry in the store. While this is just as soft as the others, this puppy does not have the satin tummy and satin ears that the babies that I have given this to absolutely love. I like the contrasting textures of the soft plush and the smooth satin. While this is a nice toy, it just isn't what I expected."
4,"Insightful, accurate, and quite readable","This is an approach to golf books that I would really like to see more of. The author has a very keen perception and attention to detail when it comes to describing the best that Scottish golf has to offer, but so have many others that have come before him. The wonderful part about this book is that Kilfara also opens up a part of his soul so that the reader can try to relate to or understand him as a person while he describes this journey. Many times have I read a book about sports and wondered about personal details of the author that determine his perception of what he is desacribing. Kilfara lets us in to a part of his psyche and should be roundly applauded for it. Anyone that did not enjoy this book I believe does not like, understand or appreciate golf or is plainly jealous of the wonderful courses the author has been able to play."
4,Historical desert racing documentary,I suppose this was a great movie back in the 20th century when it was made. Rick Mears and Parnelli jones were not old yet and Ironman Stewart was an unknown back then. The racecars are antiquated by todays standards. Everybody is wearing polyester lesure suits with wide lapels and huge neckties. Parnelli Jones was particularly rediculus with a combover that looked like it started at the back of his head. I think Parnelli Jones and Donald Trump(the Donald) go to the same hair stylist.Overall a great movie but it is getting really old. They need to make a new one and use clips from this one as historical footage.
1,These discs are DVD-R,"Be forewarned that these discs are dvd-r's -- and are not described as such on Amazon. They may or may not play in your dvd player. DVD-R's are also not as long-lasting. Usually, Amazon has an ""NB"" regarding DVD-R's but as yet has not done so."
3,Good for the price,"It doesnt do much, no masage, just bubbles. When you do turn on the bubble feature be sure to add a small amount of soap as the bubbles will over flow. Its fine to just put your feet in when you give yourself a pedicure."
1,Not worth your money,"This product as others have said, does not heat up. Used it only a handful of times and it stopped working. A waste of money"
1,Utterly useless except for making noise,"This thing is an utter and complete fraud. It does not heat, it does not massage, and it most certainly not relaxing, given the headache you'll receive from the drone of the motor. Despite it being as loud as a vacuum cleaner, it has none of the power and propulsion force you'd expect with all that noise. The jet is very weak and I could barely feel it. About all it's good for is making water sputter around and using up electricity. The ""massaging"" comes from you rubbing your feet over the raised surfaces, not that there's much room to wiggle since the motor takes up the entire middle. Emptying it is also clumsy because it doesn't have a spout or angled mouth.This thing is absolutely worthless. I rarely give 1 star reviews, but this product is not even deserving of that much. Do not buy unless you insist on wasting good money. You'll get better results with a wash basin, a kettle of hot water, and a long tube to blow air into."
3,Pleased,"This is a smiple machine that works well. It heats the water to a good temp.The movement of the water is the right speed and makes my feet feel good after standing all day. The only thing I would change would be to put a drain on it, is hard to empty the water out of it."
1,Junk-buy something else,"This thing does not heat and does nothing. I am a victim of false advertising.You need to move your own feet to ""massage them"" on fixed hard, uncomfortable plastic fixtures. It hurts!It is noisy and a complete rip-off.I bought it for my wife for Christmas and it's a total dud. What a disappointment! Bummer."
1,Does not do what it promises,"Box says heat, but it does not heat. Water turns cold fast. Massage and bubbles are worthless. And the thing in the middle with the nodes, I have no idea what those are for. I know what they are suppose to be for, but they don't do anything. This was a $20 bucket. Buy a bucket instead and save money."
1,Abysmal,"Absolutely abysmal. I cannot recommend this ""Relaxing Spa Foot Bath"" from Conair. The water goes cold very quickly (even though it is supposed to heat), the foot area is cramped and it splashes water outside the unit all over the floor. Bad design. Exagerated claims."
1,"Cold Wet Feet, Nothing More","There is only 1 small strip of holes where the bubbles come from, right beneath your feet;There's no heat and it does not maintain the heat of the water;The center attachments are just decorative - they do nothing without you having to rub your foot over them;The unit is loud so you can hear the motor running like a fan, so it's impossible to relax at all.Not a worthwhile choice if you're looking for actual comfort and relaxation with the benefits that are advertised. I think it's a ripoff because the box says ""with heat"" but there is no heat, and gives you the impression that the center attachments actually work. It's a let down and when you're looking forward to a nice foot massage with heat and bubbles, you end up with cold wet feet!"
2,"It's ok, not great","This foot both is nice and relaxing. The bubbles are really nice. The down side is the 'heat' is just not there at all. I started out with hot water and by the time i was done the water was cool. The attachments don't really do much either. They kind of just sit there, i wasn't really sure how it was supposed to massage anything. But i guess for a 5 min foot soak its OKAY, but not great."
1,Horrible Product,"For the first time in what seems like forever, I went to my favorite department store. This particular foot bath was on clearance. Wanting a fun messaging foot bath for a long time, I decided to give this product a try. I got home from the store, quickly unwrapped my new foot bath and filled 'er up with water. My feet are in the bath as I'm writing this. The other reviewer is right when he/she says the water gets cold...and water splashes out of the tub. The tub feels cheap. The attachments are a joke. This whole product is a joke! It's best to save your money and/or splurge on a different brand foot bath. I am frantically trying to find my receipt so I can return this product, pronto!"
1,UNHAPPY,My wife was unhappy that it didn't heat up as is said it would on the box. THANK FOR THE X-MAS GIFT SHIPPER.
1,Awful,"I'm using it now and it's extremely noisy, water is already cold after 5 minutes, and the bubbles barely work. I'm taking it back tomorrow. Very disappointed..."
4,footbath,I love the bubbles on my toes. Love the way it bubbles and heats. It does make your tootsies feel soft and extra clean. Need to add a small jar of oil so we know what to buy!
2,Not what I expected,"Well, I ordered this one because the one I wanted wasn't in stock anymore. The unit works and everything, it just is not what I was looking for. The massage element is almost non existent, though there are plenty of bubbles. The insert says that the heating element part does not heat up cool water, but maintain the warmth of already heated water, which is false. Because of the aerated bubbles, the water went cold very quickly. It comes with three attachments that you are supposed to affix to the middle portion of the unit, one for arches, one for soft massage and something else, but the post where you connect the attachment does not vibrate for the massage at all. I work in retail, and am in high heels 8-10 hours a day, 5 days a week, and I need something more powerful than this.I wish I would have just spent a little extra and gotten the more expensive one, or waited for the one I wanted to come back in stock!"
2,no heat,I have not gotten any heat when using this one... plenty of bubbles but no heat.. gets ice cold...
3,It's Ok,It's ok for the price. I don't mind the fact that it doesn't keep/heat the water I just put water that will stay hot for the 15 mins that it says to us it. The vibrations are fine could be a little stronger and quieter tho but since I stand on my feet all day it really relaxes my feet.
1,TOO LATE :(,"Well.. This piece of plastic with a blower for bubbles does not represent what the product claims... Heating ? None.. except around the heat of the blower running. The water gets cold fast. NO the water will not heat up.. So you must put in your own hot/warm water. Attachments.. JUNK.. They do nothing. THESE PEOPLE SHOULD BE SUED for FALSE ADVERTISING.... Unfortunately for me I had a friend go and purchase 'something' for me on my doctors orders. Yeah, I'll keep it, all I wanted anyway was a foot bath to put epsom salts in... and that's exactly all it's good for. Soaking! Oh, the 'Bubbles' ? They don't even tickle... Cheeesh ! I hope whoever's reading this hasn't bought the product yet (unlike me)."
2,"not doing much, too loud","it's quite noisy, considering it doesn't do much except generating some light bubbles. the accessories are confusing, since there is no brochure to explain the function and how to use them, so I just tossed them aside. I felt embarassed to spend close to 30 dollars to get a noisy washing basin."
1,Buy a bucket,"The tub doesn't leak and the bubble pump works well.However, the pump motor is LOUD and interferes with 'over the air' television. The heater is weak -- hot water is cold quick. If you hope for a warm foot soak, look elsewhere."
2,A big disappointment,"I bought one of these because I am on my feet all day at my job and wanted something to ease the aching in them after a hard day. The bubbles do feel good, but that is the only good thing I can say about this product. The water gets cold quickly, even though the description claims this product keeps the water heated. Worst of all, it is not relaxing because the noise is like a vacuum cleaner. I even tried putting in earphones while using it, and I still couldn't drown out the noise. I still use it occasionally, but I get more relief from using a cooling foot lotion than using this foot bath."
5,Every American should read this book..,"It was my textbook in American Politics class, and I found it very honest. That's a quality media lacks in the Corporate America. It explains well why there is no democracy in America but Elitism (White-AngloSaxon-Protestant presidents who work for corporations) and how the corporations use mass media to control masses (mostly TV-because uneducated masses tend to watch TV a lot) How Electoral College does not let masses to involve politics. Lots of great info, and very easy and fun to read."
1,Uhh . . .,"When I did actually open this book and read it (for class) I found it boring and dry, typical college textbook!"
1,too much money,when are the publishers going to stop gouging students for a paperback???For 70 bucks it should be a hardback at least!
4,Naturalizer Womens Loafer,"This is a nice looking and well made shoe, however I wish I would have order 1/2 size larger. The roll around the top of the shoe hurts at the heel. I'm hoping it will stretch."
2,Received defective,I had heard good things about this product but the way it is packaged I believe lead it to be defective upon arrival. The cord is so tightly wrapped in it's retail plastic package that I believe it damaged the sensor. I plugged in and tested in multiple outlets never getting it to engage or show power.Chances are I got a lemon and Amazon refunded the full amount including return shipping but I wanted to let others know in case this is an ongoing issue.
2,A short fairy tale for young adults,"Mercedes Lackey fans, please do not be fooled into thinking this is a typical novel of hers. It is a short story (or novelette at most), geared toward young adult readers. While it isn't bad, it certainly isn't what I expect from a typical Lackey read!"
1,Not one of the better books by Mercedes Lackey,"The only reason to buy this book is if you are absolutely desperate to own/read everything this author has ever written. If you have read all the Heralds of Valdemar series, and are looking for that depth and quality,I think you will be as disapointed as I was. The depth of characters and storyline is just not here. Girl has healing powers, heals forest creatures and faery, enter a magical horselike being, father dies, enter bad-guy and suprise arranged marriage, saved by man of her dreams, with suprise ending similar to a Hans Cristian Anderson tale.This should have been a short story. The cute little book with borders and embelishment,takes up just enough space to stretch it into a hardback. Can we say, ""waste of money!"" If you want to read wonderful series by Mercedes Lackey with unforgetable characters Vanyel, Elspeth and Tahlia are waiting."
3,Not long enough.,"While I enjoyed the story, it would have been better if it had been longer. There were places that I felt were slightly shallow in development, and several of the characters were one dimensonal. My overall impression of the book was that it was suitable for a younger audience, but if all you're looking for is an enjoyable book to pass the time with, read this. Just don't expect too much."
5,A glimpse into the past,This is a very scholarly examination of a sgnificant process in the mid-eighteenth century from which we can learn a great deal.
3,Somewhat satisfied.,The product had at least 7 oz's missing. It was factory sealed but for the product received was 16.9 and had 7.0 oz's missing. So I paid for 9.9 oz's.
4,Great Songs,"Spellbound is a worthy follow-up to Forever Your Girl, comprising as it does a charming and diverse collection of songs. It includes a dash of rap in the form of Rock House, nice ballads like Rush Rush and blowing Kisses In The Wind, great dance numbers like To You and U, and some funk in Vibeology. All the songs on this album bear the stamp of Paula's characteristic passion and dedication - The sprightly U was written by Prince. This album amply demonstrates Abdul's multifaceted talent: her total creative involvement and passionate commitment to her work and music are evident throughout. It will have you tapping your feet and singing along in no time."
3,nice effort,"this album is like an extended ""rhythm nation"" but not as good though it definitely takes you back to the glory days of early 90's dance pop and yearning for those times. Promise of a New Day, Vibeology and Spellbound are awesome pop classics though Forever Your Girl and Head Over Heels are the masterpieces of her career"
4,Classic Album,I love this album especially my 3 favourite tracks. *Rush Rush *Will You Marry Me? and my favourite track which doesnt seem to be listed on this version of the album *Goodnight My Love (pleasant dreams). I can listen to that song over and over. Buy this album.
3,Spellbound,"Paula's sophmore effort Spellbound has some really catchy songs on here that will stay in your head all day long and keep you dancing. Those songs Im talking about, are like The Promise Of A New Day, Spellbound, Vibeology, etc. Spellbound showed some growth with Paula as an artist, and showed some really good music, however not all songs are stellar. The best songs on the album include Promise of A New Day, Rush Rush, Spellbound, Vibeology, and Will You Marry Me. The other songs are nice but pale in comparsion to these ones. This is a nice album to have, I reccomend it."
3,"Not bad, but nothing special","This album was is not as good as Forever Your Girl or Head Over Heels, but it's still decent. ""Promise of a New Day"" has a good beat, but the lyrics are poor. ""Rock House"" is the best dance song on the album, a mix of both rock and house, but the lyrics are actually in reference to the White House (in other words, rock them until they do something about all the problems in the world).I do give Paula credit for this album though because this was the first album where she had some REAL ballads. ""Rush Rush"" and ""Will You Marry Me"" are beautiful songs with great lyrics.This album however has several filler tracks. ""Vibeology"" is a generic dance song and ""U"" and ""Spellbound"" are just a mess. The rest of the songs are just OK."
2,"A disappointment...once you've read this review, you'll know","Basically, I don't think the dance music here is very genius nor does it do her justice very much, ""Vibeology"" sounds like something you'd hear at an adults-only club, but ""Promise of a New Day"" hits home. Other than that, there just ain't a whole lot of fun stuff to enjoy unlike the cheerful ""Forever Your Girl."" If you like real dance music, FYG is the best Paula Abdul CD I've heard."
5,Oldie but goodie.,"I've always been a Paula Abdul fan. I had the CD previously but got it all scratched up! Glad I could replace this fun record at such a great price. It has a nice mix of catchy songs and of course, Rush, Rush!"
4,Promise of a New Day!,"When Paula Abdul released, Forever Your Girl, that album skyrocketed in sales and is remembered for it's music videos which always featured dancing. After all, Paula Abdul's background was choreographer and dancer so we expect a good beat and dancing. The music today doesn't make me want to dance but turn off the radio. In this album release, it opens up with the quick beat of ""Promise of a New Day,"" which I think is appropriate. Her video was even spoofed about it. I also liked ""Rush, Rush,"" which had a video with Keanu Reeves in it. The video was strange enough. The song is a lot deeper than her other songs. It has a serious tone and I liked it even though I didn't understand what she was trying to say in it. The other songs like ""Will You Marry Me?"" is sweet and cute to listen too.Paula Abdul can sing and dance and I wish her well in the future whatever that might be whether American Idol where I think she became truly a household name or elsewhere."
3,3 1/2 stars.....this is not that bad of a album...,"This is not that bad of an album. I do like the songs: ""The Promise Of A New Day"", ""Rush Rush"", ""Vibeology"" and ""Will You Marry Me?"", but her voice is too screechy. I'm not a big Paula Abdul fan, but I do like most of her songs. But she really can't sing all that well to me, but she can dance well. If you like pop/dance music then you'll like this album. Is it worth the money? I should say, yes, this album is ok."
4,The Best Overlooked Album Ever,"When this album came out, it was bashed by critics but still sold millions. I don't care what anyone says it's fantastic. Paula's voice sounds better than ever and Spellbound is filled with great songs. Promise Of A New Day is an upbeat dance tune with a great chorus, Rush Rush is a lovely ballad, Alright Tonight is a funky capella-type track. Other songs are just as good, very catchy and upbeat. Paula's voice isn't the best, but her songs are. Buy this one!"
1,Author needs a remedial writing course,"This is probably the worst written book I have ever read. The author has no sense of paragraphing, coherence, or development. He also lacks the most basic knowledge of grammar or style. The text is laden with errors in agreement, dangling modifiers, errors in usage, repetitions, and so on and so forth. The content is at best supeficial, and what useful information there is, is clouded by the aforementiones flaws. Didn't somebody edit the thing?; or is this really some slapdash vanity press production where the so-called publisher took the author's money and ran?"
1,can't rate the product - NEVER RECEIVED IT!,"Unfortunately I am unable to review the product. Although Amazon.com billed me for the product on June 15, 25 DAYS HAVE PASSED AND I HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT. I have been in contact with USAMEDICALS who was supposed to have shipped the product, but I am still awaiting the delivery. I am totally dissatisfied with the service of both Amazon.com and USAMEDICALS."
5,Program for the play,"Job is a very confusing book. Face it, at first glance everybody sounds sort of right, but also vaguely wrong. Charles S. comes along like the hawker in a movie, ""get your program, can't tell one gladiator from another without a program!"" Charles seperates the characters, defines underlying themes hidden by verbiage, and shows why each statement is true, false, or could be. Instead of a mindless riot in printed form, it turns into a well choreographed ballet."
2,Disappointed,"I too am disappointed with Mr. Swindoll's comment about giving his son a raise in allowance after bashing in the teeth of a school mate. I don't know much about him and this is the first book of his that I have read. I keep asking myself whether his man can help me understand the word of God. ""By their fruit you will recognize them."" Maybe I should look somewhere else."
2,Fair but not great,"Great cd but there is a catch..........Watch the movie and listen to ""A Heart Is A House For Love""..and ""Nights Like This"".Then listen to the cd.On the movie these songs are sung perfectly by Billy Valentine but on the cd they changed ""A heart is a House 4 Love,"" which on the cd was sung by The Dells.I love the Dells great job but.. There is no excuse for them changing ""Nights Like This"" after 7 ruined that song. Billy Valentine sung it with power and I bought the cd hoping it was him I was very let down. I am still looking 4 a copy of him singing it but no luck."
4,OK but!!!,I love all the music but I wish they would had did the Billy Valentine version on the CD of a heart is a heart for love which is the actual version in the movie. also I like america love Patti Labelle however! I wish that the young lady voice who sang the song or background track We havn't finished yet with Robert townsend in the movie had recored it on the CD Patti put to much over kill in it. and who is it that did Baby stop running around? that was awesome!!! and yes a lot of songs that were in the movie should have been on the CD like Baby dolls stuff etc. but nevertheless is all good. the movie is awesome!!!my name is LeGrand from DC
3,Mixed Feelings,While the film was excellent the soundtrack fell short of expectation. Unfortunately in the music industry contractual obligations prevent some artists from being included on albums and cd's even though their voices were used in the film production. Others demand more money than producers are willing to pay. I can't say for sure but something along this line is probably why Billy Valentine wasn't a part of this. I wasn't as displeased with this soundtrack as others seem to be but i do understand their frustration. For those interested there is software available that will extract the audio from the dvd. Of course you would have to edit out the dialogue but it was worth it to me to get a true soundtrack.
2,Five Heartbeats,"Do not purchase the 5 Heartbeats soundtrack. The CD sounds nothing like the Movie. I was so dissatisfied, that rather than returning the product, I threw it in the trash after listening to it."
3,This CD was missing about 4 songs from the movie...,"I would not have had other groups perform the songs that were done in the movie either. The Dells were singing the songs by the Heartbeats and they should have done all the songs. Also, I think all of Flash's and Baby Doll's songs should have been there."
2,great looks poor cutting.,they are very cute and i like the spring system. unfortunately the scissor part is not sharp and if you are planning to use it for real cutting or poultry cutting they will not do. they are dull. i tried to sharpen them but since you can not open them fully the only part you can get is the 1/3 towards the pointy side.since i want it for opening bags and small chores and mainly for the looks it works for me.
3,Adorable but not very functional,Looks good and fun but not very useful for office work or thin paper. Worked best on construction paper and they scare me a little when I have them open cuz they stay open and are very sharp.
1,Adorable. But terrible scissors :-(,"Adorable. But terrible scissors :-(They can't even cut through a ""label maker"" label."
1,pretty but useless,The scissors I received were given as a gift. The recipient was honest enough to show me that they would not even cut a grocery receipt. When held up to a light it is obvious there is a gap between the blades. Too late to return as the packaging material was tossed.
3,"Very cute, cuts OK, seems cheap in some ways","This is a really cute pair of scissors that everyone admires. My only two gripes are that the spring that holds the handles open makes a ""sproing"" noise so the design seems cheap, and the scissors make a grating feeling as they close, so the blades seem cheap too. The blades are marked 'stainless steel'. Perhaps these scissors can be properly sharpened so they feel smoother in action."
4,Cute and they work great!,"I really like these scissors because they have a spring so you only have to squeeze them to cut. They have rubber grips too and can lock in the closed position for storage. I am a leftie and they seem to work equally well for lefties. I put them in the dishwasher, no special treatment. The kids love that the scissors look like a bird.The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is that the first pair I bought, the spring fell out. But I liked them enough to buy a second pair."
5,The Cat's Meow!,"I heard of Switchblade Kittens when I saw an article about their ""Titanic"" parody and I checked them out online. Well, I am sure glad I did! They ROCK! And the lead singer Drama has a rad and original voice that goes right with their original sound. I am not usually into punk music, but this band is awesome. Every song is cool. I really love ""Emily,"" ""My Dad's A Janitor,"" and ""Solar Plexus Kick."" You should defo check out this CD and see what you're missing. Watch out, cuz these Kittens have a bright future ahead of them!"
5,This is a must have...,"I listen to this CD everyday. It is so much fun. The cd is really loud and punk but the songs are fun so I don't just listen to it when I am depressed, I listen to it all the time. My parents hate it though but I guess that is a good thing. If your too old I guess you just don't get it. My dad likes the song My dads a Janitor though. buy it! buy it! buy it!"
5,I recommend this cd...........,"HI! I don't have enough money to but the cd but as soon as I do have enough, I am going to buy it because I listened to the sound clips and this band sounds so awesome! I can't wait to get the cd!"
5,Ive Got Cattitude,"Switchblade Kittens is fun, colorful, and energetic. This CD is a true call to action. Not a call to action like, ""hey lets over throw the governemnt""; but a happier one. One more along the lines of ""hey, get off your butt, have fun, and stop taking yourself so seriously"".I would highly suggest this album to anyone who would like to someday watch their friends purchase an SBK record at a big name record store and have the pleasure of saying ""oh ya, I had that CD before that band went huge"".(...)"
4,Rock n Wit,"Energetic, upbeat, punky music that will get you jumping up and down. The vocals are superb, and the lyrics are witty. My favorite song of their's is ""Ode to Harry Potter"", and all of their songs enjoy the same pop culture references and great music."
4,Short but good,"I was disappointed with the legenth of this cd, but the songs that are there are great! I like ""All Cheerleaders Die"" and ""Emily."" I first heard of the group because of their song ""Ode To Harry Potter."""
4,Gravity,Very intense. Gave me considerable knowlege of intricities on the launch and life in the orbiter. The suspeonse is great and the imagination is great.
4,"Great Book, must read","This book was excellent..i finished it in a day for i could not put it down. i do agree though with some of the other reviews..more character development. there was more of a description of the minor characters, for example Diana, than the main ones. the ideas were great and the gorry descriptions were well, vivid. i am not grossed out by that, but i am sure many people would be. extremely far-fetched and i really wish i knew how jack and emma got home! i also thought it was funny how jack was always there when he was not even part of the mission. but overall, it was a very good book and as stephen king said, you will be up all night"
3,Not her best work,"I'm a huge Tess Gerritsen fan and this is probably the first one that didn't put me over the top. I was fascinated by the space station information, but certainly there was some dramatic license taken. Especially the ""rescue"" seemed implausible. While the medical backdrop is usually what I like best about Ms Gerritsen's books, this one was, pardon the pun, a little out of this world."
4,Heroes And Suspense,"I wasn't too sure about the space aspect of this mystery. I like movies about outer space, but books in this genre usually bore me cross-eyed. What a nice surprise this book turned out to be. The space/medical/mystery combination works very well. A stunning beginning leads, eventually, to a heart-stopping ending. There were a few flat spots about halfway through, but the pace soon picked up again. The heroics in this story had me in tears. A very involving read."
5,Spectacular and breathtaking,This book is awesome and a must read for anyone who likes medical thrillers!!!!
4,A wonderful and entertaining read!!!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It is the first Gerritsen book I have had the joy to read. It was good!! I liked the characters and she did an excellent job on the plot. The ending was good, but not as complex as it could have been (in my opinion). I'll say, though, I look forward to reading her other books and any book in the future. I finished ""Gravity"" in three days. Enjoy this book."
3,"Pretty good story, but.....","The basic premise of this story was very good. There was a lot of action and suspense, and the plot moved along well enough. My one quibble with this book, however, was the annoying, overabundant use of acronyms. Mentioned once or twice, okay, but the same letters used repeatedly became tiresome, and I found myself skimming in parts. Was she writing for us, the readers, or for the employees of NASA? Enough, already!"
3,Good mystery,"The writing wasn't the best, but it was very suspenseful, just like her other mysteries. You can't believe the heroine will survive. Lots of insights about space travel."
3,Different to the usual Gerritsen books,For me this was a good read even though it was a bit horrible at times . I would recommend Gravity to readers who once started reading found it hard to put the book down.
4,A different Tess gerritsen.,"A little different to Tess's usual procedural. But equally as ""page turning"". Would recommend as an easy read to procedural/sci fi fans alike."
5,"Gravity-Lookout Palmer,Crichton and Cussler","I've read the other three books by Gerritsen;each of which was a page-turner,but this was the most exciting page-turner I've read! From page one to the last the story kept moving,holding one's interest and curiosity to keep on reading. At one point the story becomes so exciting and action-packed, I had to put the book down for the day. A ""must read"" for anyone into medical thrillers. So,when's the next one? I hope in the near future."
1,Disappointed!,"I've read most of Tess Gerritsen's recent novels, and found them totally unputdownable; but this one just didn't cut it with me. I think maybe it was the setting of the book that put me off. Space missions and sci-fi just don't push my buttons and I couldn't seem to get beyond that. Although, having read other reviews on here, maybe I should perhaps just stick with it a little longer?"
4,Gravity,"As of today, Monday 2nd of February, 2009, I have not read this book, but I have and am now reading one of the books this author has written. I am reading them in sequence. I can say that I have not been displeased with any of her books thus far. She is a great writer. I would recommend her books to any one likes to read medical mysteries and the like.All I can say to her is keep up the good works!"
2,Disappointed,This is the first Tess Gerritsen book I didn't like. I have read all of her books in the Rizzoli/Isles series and her book Harvest but this one I didn't even finish. I couldn't get into at all. I will still read any more she comes out with but this one wasn't for me.
1,how much was king paid to endorse this ( )?,"hollow, stereotypical people populate this horrible book. this book makes ""independance day"" seem packed with verisimilitude. if you like medical books written well, try richard preston."
1,JUST... HORRIBLE,"I read one of T.G's books and was delighted. I figured why not pick up another :-D. Wrong... :-(. This book was atrocious!! A complete disgrace to the book reading world. The logic of her ""intelligent"" characters was pathetic and unbelievable. And she gave way too much information, and introduced characters she could have left out. But most importantly this book was predictable. In fact it was so predictable it is insulting. I have never burned a book before, but after giving this ridiclous novel 3 days of my life I'll never get back. I dumped it in my kitchen sink and lit it on fire!! Good riddance!"
3,Fast Action Story,"GRAVITY is Tess Gerritsen's latest novel. With the background of space exploration, anything goes and it does happen; probably too much. The story really moves, but the characters aren't given time to evolve. Jack and Emma are getting a divorce, but you never learn any more about them, except they can't meet without fighting. The relationship element of the story is very much lacking. Blend the idea of an outerspace micro organism with the space station; bodies all over the place, and you have the techno-thrill essence of this novel. Lacking character's you care about on more than a superficial level and the annoyance of too many acronyms(I kept skipping over this part after a while) this novel would have been better as a paperback. The author's previous book BLOODSTREAM was much more original as to medical cause and character. It's a good end of the summer quick read, but not one you'll go back to during the rest of the year."
4,"Very good book, but I am into now time, not space time","Ms. Gerritsen always outdoes herself with her writing. I did enjoy the book, but would have prefered if it was strictly earth time. I will continue buying Ms. Gerritsen's books. They are all winners."
4,"Solid, entertaining SF/THRILLER","This was my first Tess Gerritsen book and overall I was impressed. Probably my favorite technique in sc-fi thrillers is leading the audience into thinking that they know exactly what is going on and then suddenly take a u-turn--and Gerritsen does this wonderfully in GRAVITY. The story moves at breakneck speed and I read the whole book in about 4 hours. I only had a few problems--wasn't crazy for the estranged couple storyline. It felt too cliched to me. I know its important to create conflict between your main characters, but I just felt this was an easy out. I also thought that one of the major foreshadowings of the plot was extremely obvious and probably could have been handled better. These problems, however, are relatively minor. In the end, GRAVITY will definitely hold you in its quite formidable spell."
4,gripping book,"i've been into cook, palmer, and some of gerritsen, when i saw this one. it's one of the best i've ever read. keeps you intrigued right til the end. my husband even said it was one of the best and he's really particular about books."
4,How I became a Tess Gerritsen fan,"This is the first book I read by Tess Gerritsen and after finishing it, I started looking for more. Although the final resolution was pretty obvious with a hundred pages to go, it still kept my interest and did not slow down at all. Ms. Gerritsen generally does a good job creating characters that the reader actually cares about one way or the other and this book is no different. I won't spoil it by saying too much about the fates of the people in the space station, but...wow...'I feel your pain.' Great book"
3,In Space NoOne Can Hear You Scream...But they can see you bleed and bleed and...,"Doctor turned writer Tess Gerritson sets a medical thriller featuring a parasitic alien virus in outer space so in addition to the medical lingo it's full of NASA jargon too.Efficient,well thought out but also predictable.Loaded with gruesome death and swirling explosions of blood this story has a great Oh Yuck! factor.It's an entertaining enough book just don't expect anything overly orginal."
3,Medicine on Space,"I like the way Ms. Gerritsen went out of the usual hospital scene and environment and took the risk of bringing the practice of medicine into space. As we all know of, Ms. Gerritsen was a practicing physician and writing about the field of medicine is nothing new to her. Space, in the other hand, is new. I took it that she went to a great deal of research just write this book and it turns out well. I have enjoyed reading Gravity and I surely will reccomend it though it could not be compared to her other books namely Harvest, Life Suport and The Surgeon. Not every book is perfect and there will always be a downfall on a certain literary work but each work deserves respect."
2,Disappointing,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tess' first few medical thrillers, but I lost enthusiasm for this book about halfway through. It was too predictable. There were entire scenes which could have been tossed out, like having both the USAMRIID people AND the heroes discover that the creature's DNA includes strands from three species. And the ""required"" Hollywood scene of the hero losing patience with the Army guy and attacking him, making the Army guy cave. At times I felt I was reading a screenplay for another hackneyed alien-invader story. And this is one had a premise I was very excited about reading, too. Less jargon (all right already, you did your research--yawn) and more emphasis on characterization so I CARED what happened to these people would have greatly improved this read."
2,Predictable and disappointing,"Yes - the technical details, medical and engineering-wise, are very good. The story has just the right number of characters, and the pace of events is breathtakingly high. So what's the problem? It is all clinically formulaeic, pardon the pun. The tempo proves to me that more is not necessarily better, and the characters are disappointingly shallow. My mind was always 10 pages ahead of what I was reading, so it all seemed like old news when I reached another turn of events.This was my first encounter with this author. I am not sure that I would try another one."
3,A good reading experience.,"I enjoyed reading this book. As the story progressed I didn't want to put the book down. It's got all the makings of the type book you'd want to read and it isn't run of the mill as some would have you believe, but novel, and written for the adult. The story is of present time, the characters interesting and suspense is plentiful. I've read most of the other authors of this genre and place Ms. Gerritsen securely amongst them. It deserves 3 1/2 stars, and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author."
4,a overall good book,"This is a very good book. Although idea has been done before. Hot Zone was the book name. Anyhow the idea is simple, there is a virus killing a whole mess of people. I liked this book and would recommend this book to anyone"
4,Good book - interesting space information,Purchased the book while waiting for flights from GSO - ATL - IND today and found the book very interesting. Quick read also! Particularly liked the sections dealing with the space station and NASA. A quick read - I would recommend waiting for the paperback to come out!
4,I couldn't put it down,"This was a real page turner. You just can't wait to find out what is going to happen next. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars were some of the obvious plot devices introduced, to me at least. Example, Jack's emergency-only-done-it-once before procedure in the beginning of the book, and the Apogee II. Otherwise, good stuff."
1,Stupid Maniac Appalling Abysmal BS,"Never mind what it says on the cover of her books that she is a bestselling author and better than Crichton and Palmer. It is all BS. She is not a writer and she has no idea what it means to write a book. I have run out of books before and picked up few of her downers. This was one of it. Book is terrible, so improbable, and illogical that you just get disgusted by this whole charade. Please do not waist your time on Gerritsen. Any other author - and I mean ANY - would be better than her."
4,Art & Literature in a small package,"Now I buy them for me as well as my kid. The art work in this one reminds me of classic Christmas story book art ala ""Twas the Night Before Christmas"" type story books. The entire series has been a pleasure to read and a delight to the eyes, each having a unique and distinctive style."
3,Dragonite's Christmas,"Back when the first series (Indigo League) was first on the air in the States, a series of board books for the youngest viewers were also translated and offered for sale in the States. Dragonite's Christmas is the eighth in this series.As far as I can tell, these board books are outside the canon of the series. For example, in the series, Ash et al meet up with Santa. In the series, Santa works with Jynx (""Holiday Hi-Jynx""), not Dragonite. I think the first time Dragonite is mentioned is in the Orange Islands series.That being said, as alternate fiction, Dragonite's Christmas is a sweet story of Dragonite and some children having a joke on Santa. Of the board books in this series we have, it's Sean's favorite. The illustrations are cute and colorful and the story is engaging enough to warrant multiple reads."
4,Little kid book,"It was good, but it is for a person from 4-5 years old.Little kids would love it! Dragonite is a cool pokemon. It tells to find a veanasur,and he is under the chirstmas tree.It is great for chirstmas!"
4,Walt Disney World of the past,Nice VHS from walt disney world from the past around 10 year anniversary. Very short though and wished it would have been longer.
4,Good service,"Shipment arrived on time, however, product was partially exposed due to damage of packaging."
2,DiscSavers,[...]The product I received was I guess acceptable....It was a different one than pictured on the site the order was made from...The one in the picture was the one I wanted (with center snap and round corners)Appeared that way in the picture...The one received clasps on the outside with square corners & won't fit in the container that I keep these in. The one I got definitely is not the one in the picture.The ones received seem to be durable as the ones I was thinking I was getting so I decided to not bother with complaining.J. Newhouse
1,Cases are warped and will put pressure on CD's,"The cases I received are not like the case shown in the item photo. The cases I received are badly warped and unusable, unless I want my CD's to be rubbed and bent by the case. I considered them to be un-usable and returned them."
1,Not Da Vinci Dan Brown,"This is not by the Da Vinci Code Dan Brown, and it's not even good poetry. The higher ratings are by fairly obvious shills. It's a shame someone is making money off of the coincidence of name. Amazon should not list this book when I click on ""Dan Brown"" while looking at the Da Vinci Code."
5,...but GOOD poems.,"Yes this is a book of poems--not a thriller--but they're excellent; a little like Frost. Here's one I particularly like:On Being Asked by Our Receptionist if I Liked the Flowers""What flowers?"" I said. ""These flowers,"" she said,Gesturing leftward with her head,And there it was: a vase of flowersThat hadn't graced that fort of hersThe day before. Did I say a vase?All of an urn is what it was:Capacious home to a bursting sunOf thirty lilies if to one.A splendor I'd have seen for sure,If less employed in seeing her.If you like this one, you'll probably like others."
1,Caution,tHIS IS A BOOK IF POEMS BY DAN BROWN. DONT ASSUME IT ANOTHER NOVEL LIKE DA VINCI CODE. IT IS NOT
5,Matter,"Ok, I hear a lot of complaining about how this book of poems is not written by the same author of the DaVinci code and angels and demons and what not. Some people claim that Amazon should make it clear that this is not ""The"" Dan Brown but rather a lesser Dan Brown. That would be a complete insult to Dan Brown the poet. Further more if it takes you more than 30 seconds to realize this isn't the same Dan Brown that writes the thrillers, then perhaps Dr. Seuss books might be more appropriate for you."
5,Good Poetry! So What if There's Some Name Confusion!,"MATTER by Dan Brown is a fine group of poems definitely worth checking out. For obvious reasons, there not much in the way of conspiracies, etc. Author Confusion? As old as the hills. Check the 2 John MacDonalds, one became Ross. Or better, two Winston Churchills, near contempararies, one a best selling Civil War Historical Romance author, the other even more famous one,added his middle initial ""S"" to avoid confusion. Read about their meeting in WSC's Classic ""My Early Life""!"
1,Matter,"Totally did not enjoy. Was not what I thought it would be. Love Dan Brown's book, just not this one."
4,indespensable,"every kid has their favorite plush; this is my youngest daughter's choice. in fact, i'm ordering another one (maybe two) to replace the one we lost recently. love at first sight for my 16 mo. old. a great huggy animal friend...no real learning value, but who cares? some toys are just that--toys."
5,Creating Level Pull - An excellent reference book,Creating Level Pull is an excellent book written for amatuer as well as professional lean deployers. Highly recommended inspite of its price.
4,AWESOME!,it's great! if u put in the case can help u a lot! can reduce in my case 3 or 4 celcius degrees when i put it at max RPM... it's a kind of noisy
5,Classic Bruce Catton,"Grant has been thought of in popular history since the end of the Civil War as something of a butcher; he was not. He simply knew that defeating the South meant attrition, and leveraging what would become known as total war. This book shows how his way of war was successful, and although sometimes costly, his battles and campaigns were desinged to win as fast as could be expected. The sooner the war was over, the more lives would be spared. That was Grant, and Catton describes him masterfully."
4,"Decent pan, great price","I got this crepe pan for my wife for Christmas for about ten bucks. The actual pan part is great and it's makes the crepe making easier. The only problem is that the handle is a bit flimsy, especially where it connects to the pan. Other than that, it was a good deal I think."
4,Globe puzzle worked well,"First let me say, I grabbed this puzzle at walmart for 32.44 and didn't realize the price as it was mixed in with other puzzles - pretty steep for a puzzle. I can report that the puzzle did work very well. I had no idea how a 3D puzzle would work and worried my 10yr old would get frustrated if it caved in. The pieces are some type of stiff material and snap together to hold the shape, so no caving in. The puzzle has numbers on the back side of the pieces making it feasible for a younger person to assemble, but you still have to look at the picture side of the pieces to decide how they fit together. Since geography is often overlooked in school, it is a great educational toy. My son does like puzzles and given the price, I would only recommend the product for people who enjoy puzzles. I hope my son will eventually try putting it together without depending on the numbers."
3,"Good price, questionable service","As a retired teacher, I have used Bic 4-color pens for years, then found them hard to get.BIC 4-Color Ball Point Pen, Twelve 1 Count Packs, 12 Total (MMXP11 - Ast)Amazon's price is good.The first set I ordered was returned without my knowledge until I received notice of a refund. Had to call on Google to find Amazon.com's Customer Service telephone #! :-( 1-800-201-7575Finally got to speak with a live rep, who told me that the U.S.Post Office had returned the order as ""Undeliverable at that address."" The address was correct.I called the post office and was told that the tracking number Amazon gave me was invalid, and that they had no record of receiving and returning the order!!!Called Amazon.com again and got another order sent; this one contained 10 Medium Points(Blue barrel) and 2 Fine Points(Orange Barrel)! THOUGHT THAT THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE 6 OF EACH! :-("
5,Very useful pen for tutors,I have been using these Bic 4 color pens for years. I tutor math to students with learning disabilities and to students simply struggling with math. The ability to change colors to color code steps in algorithms or simply to emphasize certain things to remember is very valuable. Buying from Amazon is much more economical than buying from a place like Office Depot or Walgreens.
1,"It's just a pen, but they still failed","Sigh. Pens are pretty simple devices these days: we just need them to work. I bought 3 of these for work to organize my notes by color (if you're reading this, you're probably just as uptight/""meticulous""). This pen does not work. Stay away. With the exception of black, all the colors are very light and only improve from ""light"" to ""faint"" if you press down very hard. It's just a pen, but they still failed. Poor form Bic, poor form."
2,"Give me what I order, please","When I request 12, four-color Ball point pens I expect to get exactly what I order. I received some that were not what I paid for. Obviously, quality assurance was not on their ""A"" game when it came to packaging. I expected all 12 to be exactly as shown in the graphic - the blue bottomed pen that is a medium point, not 10 medium and 2 fine point. To reorder is too much of a hassle and I can live with the having two fine points. But, I will not be ordering from INKNLEAD again."
5,Love this pen!!,"I love this pen. I use it for writing in my calendar. I have appointments to keep with clients in their homes along with a personal schedule I keep for my family and kid related events like soccer and music and birthdays. The different colors allow me to organize the events better for each day so I don't miss something. Thank you Bic!! I remember these from my childhood but couldn't find them as an adult until one day I did find them in a store and bought them all. I'm sure the clerk thought I was nuts. Now I can order them online much cheaper! Thank you Amazon!! Bic also makes Fashion Colors. I just ordered some of those, too."
3,Regarding the Orange Fine Points,"I've gone through 2 of the BIC orange fine point pens in the past 6 months. They have been very useful for notes for college classes, but the black ink has stopped working even though the ink barrel is 3/4 full. I've tried various methods to fix the problem, but to no avail. All the other colors work fine though. What a shame. Otherwise it would be one of my favorite college essentials!"
3,ok sword,very sharp. great detail. handle looks more like a demon than a dragon. very hard to get into the sheath. sheath is leather-like material and sword can come through.
5,great record!,Top to bottom this album is a must have if you appreciate music! The musical arrangement is flawless the songs are catchy and you can put the cd in and let it play all the way through. Get this record youll love it!
5,Shady is Phenomenal !! * * * * * * 6 Stars,"It took a minute for this to sink in...I could not believe that I was hearing MUSIC. A superior creative collaboration with flawless ""musicianship""... I found the DVD just as exciting and invigorating as the music on the CD. Showing the developmental stages gives insight to the necessity of brotherhood in such a quality product. The insight and skills of the producer and musicians are equal on this 5 star product. This is a risky project putting emphasis on true musical talent, which is SO much needed today! A severe and extreme listening pleasure, a collaborative, cool, crisp, clear, clean, and classy product... the 6 C's gets you 6 out of 5 stars!!!!!"
1,You will be very disappointed if you buy these,"These are supposed to be extra-large sizing, 30x40. I just measured one that hasn't been washed or dried yet, and it measures 27x28. They aren't large enough to wrap my daughter's newborn in. In addition, they are not soft. Maybe that would change after washing, but then they'll probably be smaller yet after going through washer/dryer. It is truly a shame for anyone to be selling these as soft, warm, 30x40 receiving blankets."
2,Way too small,"These receiving blankets have been of very little use to us, as they are much to small to even wrap baby in - let alone swaddle. The fabric is also very thin and not durable."
1,too small and not warm,This product is a piece of junk. They are too small to cover the baby. The quality is so bad some of them broken apart the first time they were washed even before the baby could used it !!.
2,what can you do but look at it,"they are adorable, but useless. too small to swaddle or even bundle, and not warm enough to cover baby."
1,Way too small,These blankets are way too small to swaddle. What the hell are they designed for? It was a waste of money -- recommend not to buy them.
2,Sooo small!,"On the plus side, these blankies are very soft and light.... BUT.... they are sooo small! Didn't get much practical use for them as a receiving blankie so they were turned into changing mats!"
2,Bleh...,"I love Green tea, I love Pomegranate, and I love flavored teas. The reviews were good so I bought this based on that information.But I cannot gag this stuff down. It looks very appealing in the cup and smells like it should taste good, but I really really do not like it. I tried it for several days thinking it must be one of those aquired tastes, but it is still really gross to me.I ended up giving the entire case away to a neighbor who did sort of like it.... so it isn't ALL bad. Must just be me.In my opinion -- if you have not tried it, find someplace that sells it and give it a try before you buy a whole case."
1,Yogi Green Tea Pomegranate,No taste or flavor. I've purchased that same tea from Health Food Stores. It was much stronger. The expiration date was more than current yet the tea was still not strong or flavorful.
1,BEWARE!,"Followed the instructions to the letter, used the foam inserts on these headphones and the sound is HORRIBLE! These have to be the worst headphones I have ever had. There is absolutely ZERO bass and most of the midrange frequencies are gone as well. Yes the high frequencies are sharper however this is not enough.These were originally priced at twice this cost but now I see why they've cut it in half: to get rid of this worthless inventory.Save Your Money!"
4,foam helps the sound but . . .,"yes, when you fit them properly in your ear the bass is amazing and the earphones are top notch. i've never appreciated some of my music as much as i do know once i heard them with these buds. however, i've had these now for about a year and eventually the foam pieces get nasty with ear wax etc. I haven't really taken the time to try and clean them and have since switched to the rubber inserts which are far less impressive since you just don't get the bass sounds because there is no 'seal'. if anyone has any tips to clean them (or links where i can get replacement buds) please respond.-me"
5,Vinete does Jose Alfredo,Jose Alfredo with a twist. Vincente has kind of a high pitched voice but this is worth listening to. Great for spanish students. Real mariachi singing. Highly recommend to others.
3,Could have been made better,When I bought this I should have known what I was getting because one of the other reviewers said the same thing. The robe is nice and sexy so I don't feel too bad but the gown is just not wearable for anyone that weighs over 150 lbs. There are just too many flimsy strings in the back to tie up and it doesn't hang well. If they had made the back like the front this would be perfect.
2,Couple of reasons I didn't like it.,"Cute, but the description doesnt tell you that the back is made into little criss-cross strappy annoying things. Need better photos. Also, if you dont return it... to be in their hands...within 10 days of them shipping it to you, you dont get your money back!!"
1,review of product purchased,"Loved the robe but the chemise was cut so as not to fit as it should of in a plus size. Very dissatisfied with the product due to this. I will not ""risk"" ordering any more clothing thru Amazon due to this fact. The size indicated was the size my wife wears for everything else she buys but this item appeared to be poorly sized.Sincerely,Larry Buck"
1,Who's body is shaped like this ?,"The short night gown was poorly cut and badly misshaping; it's like a puzzle trying to figure out how to put it on. Then when you do get it on, you're in a rush to take it off before somebody sees you in that hideous monstrosity. The robe is kind of nice so trash the gown and keep the robe."
2,Crappy Material.,"I knew this was gonna be cheap and I just wanted the robe, but it was waaaay crappy. I also found it to be poorly sized as according to their size chart I needed a 2X/3X and it just swallowed me. This just sits in my drawer and never gets used."
3,Nice but huge,I got this because I thought it would fit but is HUGE!!!! And very complicated with all the strings and knowing which one goes where or which way does this thing go on...aggravating lol but still nice
2,Runs small,The gown seems to run small. I tryed it on and the top was aqward. It did not fit properly on the top no matter how I tried to adjust it.
1,Division Songs CD Review,My kids did not like the CD. Was boring to them. Tunes were not very catching for kids to listen to.
5,A fantastic read!!,"This new entry in Marc Cerasini's Godzilla series is a winner from start to finish! Once again, the characters are well-sketched and very likeable. Identification with their various plights comes easily to the reader under Cerasini's masterful hand. The action is fast-paced and thoroughly exhillirating. Monsters such as Baragon, Mechagodzilla, Mecha-Kingghidorah, Moguera, and , of course, Godzilla exude majestic, awe-inspiring power. A welcome seriousness pervades the novel, heightening its impact. A winner from start to finish, this novel makes one ache for the next novel in this fantastic series!!"
3,"Good, yet something missing","This book is another pretty well written book by Cerasini but still not as good as ""Godzilla 2000"". This book mainly deals with the main countries of the U.N. building giant robot monsters and preparing them to fight any monster that comes along. Once again, Godzilla is barely seen in this book, only a few spare times during the book, and the final scene. I wished this book had some more action. The final battle was well written but more like that should have been added. Basically a good book that is worth the six dollars that you are going to pay for it."
4,WHERES THE NEXT ONE?,Ive been waiting so long for Godzilla and the Lost Continent. What ever happened to this book? Could someone please tell me?
3,Where's Godzilla?,"After reading the first three G-novels, I had high hopes for this one. When I got into it, I couldn't put it down because of Marc's astounding battle scenes. I liked MechaGodzilla's battles. And Baragon was WAY COOL! Mecha King Ghidorah was as always wicked awesome. But the title is GODZILLA VS THE ROBOT MONSTERS, and that did not happen much. The only thing that I was dissappointed about was that Godzilla was a cameo character until the middle of the final chapter. Iwould have liked to see less military and more of Godzilla actually participating in the book. However, if you love Godzilla, you have to read this!"
2,Its not great but its okay,"This book is an improvement on the previous one ""Godzilla At World's End"" but that's not saying much. The characters aren't very interesting, except for the little girl who controls Mecha-King Ghidora but there's not enough of her anyway. The monster parts are rather dull, and like in the previous book the other monsters overwhelm most of the story, leaving little room for the Big G. But that doesn't mean you sholdn't buy this book."
4,A First Class Treatment of Big G.,"An excellent treament of Godzilla. If Mr.Cerasini would keep his politics to himself, it would be a better novel. His cheap shots detract from the plot, rather than add to it.But the characterization are surprisingly good, and the plot works well. TOO BAD THEY CANCELLED THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES."
1,Depressing,"To me, this was a sad view of post-Altamont hippiedom in decline, as expressed in the included Dead tune ""New Speedway Boogie"". The leaders of a mental and music revolution are hitting the skids here. Janis Joplin, drunk again, singing in front of her new Full Tilt Boogie band, excellent players all but lacking the spirit of the less talented Big Brother. The ordinarily highly articulate Jerry Garcia in a slurred stupor. The tunes are mostly mediocre, the sound quality seemed to try to emulate the poor sound at big venues in those days. The mindless gate-crashing pseudo-hip Canadian crowds. The free-spirited joy that we enjoyed in those days is missing here.Before you press that ""not helpful"" button, you might want to check out Phil Lesh's book. He wasn't all that happy with the boozing or playing either."
5,Festival Express,I haven't played both DVD's. I thought I was ordering a CD of the music only. It wasn't what I wanted.
3,Second Disk was bad,"Yes, this purchase was a two disk set, however, I was unable to view the second disk because it was defective. Because the firstdisk was not defective, I decided to keep the set anyway, but I am very disappointed that I cannot view the second disk. There were five segments, and I can only view about the last two."
3,incomplete order,The purchase was to include a two DVD set but only one DVD was included in the shipment with no explanation. That's what I get for buying on the internet without seeing the actual product.
5,Slippin' and uh Slidin'...,"The WOODSTOCK DVD is entertaining and it is also a must-own for music buffs, but it was a travesty that the Band were not seen in the film because they played a terrific set there. On FESTIVAL EXPRESS, the Band finally get the amount of screen time they deserve in films like this (THE LAST WALTZ notwithstanding) but even still, it could have been longer. Why couldn't we have gotten footage of Richard Manuel singing ""Tears of Rage"" instead of those other two? Anyway, their performances here are great, vocally shaky, but they were beginning to hit their stride. At least we have a live ""I Shall Be Released"" with Richard, and a ROCKING ""Slippin' and Slidin'"". As for the other performers, they don't exuberhate as much technical virtuosity and energy as the Band, but the whole thing is worth watching once. Danko survived many trips, but the ones he had on this train looked particularly disorienting--but nonetheless he still picked and sang!"
5,Don't Pass This One Up!,"If you're 50ish and a fan of classic rock-and-roll, this DVD is a sure bet. It's grainy but sharp and the sound is top notch. Great concert camera work and beautiful color for a 1970 road show. The scenes on the train provide some very insightful looks of what band life on the road was like back then.I just played it on my 20"" computer monitor with stereo sound and it has overwhelmed me. I have no doubts it will play beautifully on my 70"" home theater and the DTS 5.1 surround sound will be heavenly. If you are Canadian, like me, it's an added bonus to see some shots of Toronto, Winnipeg and Calgary in the background.Janis Joplin is in true form and sings some of her best. It's one of the main reasons I bought this and I'm not disappointed.Don't cheat yourself out of a memorable DVD....you'll be playing this one more than once!"
4,Good Times!,"This is a good way to get a glimpse of what life on the road was like 'back in the day'. This tour wouldn't/couldn't happen today. Despite some logistical problems, and misguided college kids who don't quite think it all the way through there was probably never a better overall time than this train trip across Canada. Well worth watching! Steve Urbauer"
4,Fun Flashback,"A nice window into the early festival era rock shows. The train looked like more fun then the shows. Great to see diverse acts like The Grateful Dead and Buddy Guy, and it's always great to see Janis. A great snapshot from a wilder,more freewheelin' time."
4,Festival Express Review,This video was realistic and describes the mood of the times. Janis Joplin was incredible. Truly enjoyed EACH of the artists.
3,Good flick but be warned,"This DVD, which was sent from Scotland, will not play on my DVD player. It has something to do with the way it is formatted....for Europe I guess. I was able to watch it on my PC, but only by changing a setting of some type, and my PC warned me it could only be changed 4 times. (?)"
1,shipping lasts longer than the batteries,these replacement batteries lasted only a few days with rare use. the original batteries that came with the produce lasted much longer and were a different brand
4,Life or Death,"Want to know what it is like to have the power to say if someone lives or dies? How would you feel if it was your job to say ""pull the plug""on a babies life? Great book! Makes you think.All hospitals should have a Ethics Committee."
2,Very poor writing skills,"This is probably the most poorly written book I have had the displeasure of reading. Did this author feel she was above using an editor? In the first twenty-four chapters I ran up against twenty-five grammer, puntuation, etc. errors. The story line could be intersting, however, the errors keep the reader back- tracking to get the point."
5,Very Will Written,The dilemmas in this book are extraordinarily touching.Ms.Belkin keeps your mind involved as she shifts between situations. It is hard to read the book without thinking what would you do if you were to make a decision such as those mentioned. You will enjoy reading this book especially if you are a deep thinker. I will gladly purchase her other books.
4,First Do No Harm,"Very well written book, but very disturbing and very very sad. It is a real eye opener, and everyone should read about the disturbing things that go on in hospitals.CM"
4,Very good but..,"Since finding Gillan best albums is almost impossible (Mr. Universe and GLORY ROAD, mainly. FUTURE SHOCK is a little bit less difficult), I was obligued to buy this bootleg, that has material from the first two aforementioned albums.The band live is sounding really great, altough there is a lot of improvisation,extending the songs. Also, in CD 1, for example, there are two shows, qwith exactly the same songs. SAo. inthis CD we have THREE versions of the song ""Mr. Universe!""Anyway. that's the best I could lay my hand upon, while I'm still searching for GLORY ROAD."
4,Good Deo that smells like cheap hotel soap,"I bought this product because it claims to be free of aluminum and animal byproducts. Despite having an impressive list of ingredients it ends up smelling like cheap hotel soap. On the positive side, its scent is mild so those around you won't think you're using cheap hotel soap. To be fair it works all day and I never bought it for its fragrance in the first place. If it is really free of aluminum and animal by-products, thats good enough for me.If you wish to use this then plan on using a body spray/perfume for fragrance while this deo will function exactly as it claims to be i.e. a deo."
2,Not working for me,"For me this deodorant works well for about 2-3 maybe 4 hrs, later on bad odor begins to come out. I am not going to buy another one, have to look for something else, organic too."
5,No more Pit sweat!,Bought this for my husband. He was always pitting out in his shirts. This product has basically stopped that unsightly ring in the armpit look. He feels more confident now.
3,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I've had hyperhydrosis or extremem under-arm sweating my whole life. I've lived with stained wet shirts forever. When Howard Stern started RAVING about this all-natural deoderant, I thought I'd give it a try. I got the Summer Spice scent and it smells a little ""hippy-ish"" for me. Also, it didn't keep my armpits smelling great all day, I smelled like B.O. by the end of the day and the next morning, it was completely gone. So, it is all natural, which is nice, but I don't think it works all that better than regular deoderant. Sorry Howard Stern."
4,Best Natural Deoderant I've Tried!,"I really like this deoderant. It seems to work better than the other natural deoderants I've tried. The only problem I have is that my husband thinks the scent is kind of ""manly."" I may try one of the other scents."
2,Stinky Product,"Being an avid Howard Stern fan, I tend to listen to him when it comes to products that he likes. He was searching for a deoderant that didn't contain aluminum because there are studies that link aluminum to certain cancers. He came upon Nature's Gate and was so happy that he found an aluminum free deoderant since he is very health concious. I decided to also try this product. Shortly after purchasing and using it I realized that it had no staying power for body odor. My job doesn't entail any physical labor but by the time I would get home from work I noticed that unwanted aroma wafting from my arm pits. I immediately stopped using it because I want to smell like a female, not a physical laborer. Shortly after I stopped using it, Howard starting mentioning on air that he was smelling 'a whiff' with this product and he has since stopped using it. So, this product MAY be safer to use health wise but stink-wise it doesn't cut the mustard."
2,Scent great but side effect,"I love Nature's Gate products, especially their shampoos and face wash so I figured I would give their Lemongrass and Clary Sage deodorant a try since the last natural deodorant I found without aluminum actually had Triclosan in it. The scent was great but it lost its effectiveness about halfway through my work day (mostly computer desk work). Unfortunately the second day I decided to use a fair amount more given that it was not as strong as normal deodorants. After working out I found that my underarms were very swollen, red, and irritated. Apparently I must be allergic to something in the deodorant. Possibly its the sage i'm allergic to as I have come in contact with lemongrass many times even in drinks so I'm gonna keep using Nature's Gate stuff but I might veer away from their deodorants for now. Allergy sufferers be careful and test it lightly first."
3,Does not last..,"I actually like the smell - very natural. But it doesn't last. Towards the end of the day, the deo smell fades and it starts smelling unpleasant."
1,"Like others have said, not working for me","I'm with the others. It has a great smell to start with, but once you heat up it fails you, leaving you smelling worse than you would have without deodorant. I also had the irritated skin and raw (bright red) look."
2,Smells great but then awful,I have the same problem as another reviewer. It smells absolutely fantastic for a couple hours. But then it degenerates especially when you sweat. The resulting smell is heavy and musty and worse than your own regular body odor.
5,The best all natural deodorant I've found for men,"I tried Crystal natural deodorant before but it wasn't strong enough, it's okay for office use but I needed something more days when I hit the gym, etc. Nature's Gate Spring Fresh was the answer to my prayers. It smells great (it's a masculine scent so I don't recommend this for the ladies) and lasts most of the day."
1,"product smelled good, did not work at all (tea tree & blue cypress)","Smelled really fresh but didn't work at all. As a bonus, it acted as an adhesive and I had black sweater fuzz stuck to my not at all fresh armpits when I got home from the office after my first and last day using this product. Oh well."
3,Howard Stern LOVES THIS PRODUCT,"I got this not realizing Spring Fresh was a manly scent. so, I will pass on to my brother and get back to you."
1,effiveness,"I found that this product did not work for me at all. Maybe it would work for someone else, after all, our metabolism is different."
5,Love this deoderant,"I never thought I was fussy about deoderant, until the store I used to buy this at stopped carrying it! I tried others, they stopped working halfway through the day and left me smelling like a boy. This one smells spicy-herby and gets me home still smelling pretty good."
3,Prefer their other scent more.,I would recommend the Autumn Breeze scent over this scent. I was happy with the Autumn Breeze scent but decided to try others. The Spring Fresh scent has an over-powering (musky smell) which I do not like. I will either try their other scents or go back to Autumn Breeze but I won't buy this one again.
2,there's no longer any scent,"I really wanted to like this since it smells good, like musky tree bark. I put a bunch on, but after 2 hours, there's no longer any scent. There's no horrible odor but there's no longer any musky scent. I walked 6 miles and it was gone, this was in winter. No point in getting anymore."
5,Fasten your seat belt ....,"Typically, I do not care for science fiction, fantasy, or even predictable romance ... but this book is incredible. Well developed, exciting, emotional and by the third chapter you realize that Megan Sybil Baker has a very special talent that should not be limited to only 313 pages."
2,"Worth criticizing, that's something","Interesting romance idea, but not quite convincing. The sci-fi was laid onto the romance as a cheap veneer. Ooh! Fantasy romance in space! Not awful, but An Accidental Goddess is better."
3,disapointing,"I loved the bright primary colors (blue, red, yellow) at first, and the sheets fit the mattress perfectly. However, after one washing (following washing instructions), the colors faded (red became almost pink!) and they shrunk a bit, but enough that it's now a struggle to get the sheets on the mattress."
3,Bluegrass Gospel thought,"A brief thought for Adam, 2004.Why even bother to comment? Your negativity is worthless to others and harmful to yourself. That you have the right to speak freely does not mean you should berate others for their beliefs. Have you read the Bible? Have you read what Jesus said? You will diss Him at your own peril, my friend. And your highfalutin attitude will not save you then , for every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that Jesus is Lord.Wise up."

4,"Great, But Forgettable","My reaction to this and the two subsequent volumes of Molique quartets on cpo is exactly the same as my reaction to the work of Louis Spohr. It's utterly captivating music to listen to, but when an individual work is over, nothing about it sticks in the memory. Such a description might cause you to put these discs in the Save for Later bin. But I don't recommend that: not everything needs to be Beethoven!Spohr was on my mind after I'd listened to this album and then took a look at the liner notes. So I wasn't at all surprised to learn that Molique, despite the French name, was actually German -- and a pupil of Spohr. If second-tier composers are too lowly for you, you'd be missing a mental and emotional treat here. So what if, when you put this in your player, you have no clear picture of what you're going to hear. When you do hear it, splendidly played by the Mannheim String Quartet, it's a joy!"
4,It does the job for tv or vcr cover!,"This is a great product to keep little ones from pushing those buttons on tv's or vcr's. after we installed, child would leave tv/vcr alone and watching a movie without the tv/vcr going off was nice. great for tv's/ vcr that are at level where toddler can reach it. The product is flat, so if the front of your TV is curved then your child may be able to reach there little fingers in and still push the buttons, -otherwise GREAT!"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK,returned - you can push the buttons right through the thin plastic - this is a complete waste of money!!
4,Intensely psychadelic performance.,With less annoying crowd chatter than other Bootmon releases of their concerts this lets you enjoy the music for what it is...raw mindaltering electronic nirvanna.Not as slick and polished as modern day Tangerine Dream and sure the technology is a little bit dated but the performance has a palpable sustained almost feverish intensity that can never be recreated by anyone else(not even Tangerine Dream themselves).A literal blast from the past and a great collector's item.
3,Bootleg Dream,"This is pretty good stuff! All Tangerine Dream fans who love electronica, this is the album for you. The recording is right before TD started to get into heavy sampling and computer generated sounds that dominated the albums from the mid-80's onward. This is a bootleg recording like the ""sets"" collection vol 1 & vol 2. The quality is very good and it is enjoyable to listen to. This is a good addition to any TD collection."
3,Super Reader,"Adaptation, and that is about that. However, it was decently done, and I am sure most people are familiar with the story. Archaelogist-pulp hero finds an old flame and must save the world from nazis attempting to put the Ark of the Covenant to evil ends."
1,Don't believe billboards,"The book was advertised on a billboard as a thriller. Well, it was totally unoffensive, predictable and had way too much Mormonism"
2,I guess it will do,"This book has entirely too many subplots and characters. The main storyline gets lost in all of the fluff. While I understand the need for ""clean"" novels, substituting ""Szz!"" for profanity is not a step up on the clean stories ladder. However it certainly is readable if you really have a lot of extra time on your hands and absolutely must have something, anything to read."
2,Too many plots,"From this book you could write at least two different books. Some plots are good, some bad and some plain boring. When you read the good parts you'll be thrilled but when you are reading the boring plots you'll like to throw away the book... just do it. There are at least two plots that are awfully long and they don't have to do anything or almost anything to the main plot."
2,"Nice try, but falls far short of goal","I had to read this to see what a ""clean"" thriller was like. While his attempt was certainly laudable, the results are far from exemplary. This novel is rather schizophrenic, as if a modern thriller had been transplanted onto a 1950s TV drama; I almost expected The Beav or Andy Griffith to step in and solve the whole thing. The writing runs hot and cold, the characters are either squeaky-clean or evilevilevil, some of the characters' actions are questionable, and the attempts to work around offensive material are more often than not awkward. His strong point is plotting-- in fact, there is probably enough plot for two or three thrillers. There is so much that at times he is reduced to summarizing events instead of really getting into them in detail, despite the book's massive length. For something like this to work, you need to have a lot of psychological depth. An interesting read, no more."
5,Captivating from page one!,Ken Merrell has written a capitivating thriller. You never know what's going to happen from one moment to the next!
4,THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOUR FINGERS WHITE KNUCKLED TO THE PAGE.,"THANK YOU MR. MERRELL FOR WRITING A BOOK THAT KEPT MY ATTENTION TO THE VERY END AND FOR KEEPING IT CLEAN. IT WAS SO REFRESHING TO PICK UP A BOOK AND NOT WORRY ABOUT VULGARITY, SEXUALLY EXPLICIT STORY LINES AND HAVE A STRONG BASIS FOR A GREAT READ. YOU BROUGHT MURDER, MYSTERY, INTRIG, FAMILY AND RELIGIOUS VALUES ALL INTO ONE BOOK. I WAS BEGINING TO WONDER IF IT COULD EVER HAPPEN IN ONE BOOK BUT MR MERRELL YOU DID IT! I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING MORE OF YOUR BOOKS. GOOD LUCK."
4,A Must Read!,I love Peter Straub and this book only demonstrates his early talent. It's not really horror but it's still Straub at his best. The characters and plot are very complex and the prose is energetic and just pulls you along. I loved the way the family dynamics were played out and the way the characters were presented. If you haven't read this early book by Straub you're really missing out!
4,A reasonable Answer to difficult problems,"This book along with other books by Joseph Farrell give a reasonable scenario. It does sound fantastic as a power source, but how much more believable than a tomb!"
2,He had me until the magnets,Dunn wrote a very good book chuck full of detail and good arguments and reasoning until he started talking about magnets lifting rocks. After that the book went down hill and I took him less and less seriously.
2,Great Book,"This is easily one of the funniest books I've ever read, but I gave it two stars because it is well written. Yes, the pyramids as power plants to run all the tools used to cut the stones for the pyramids--well except the first pyramid--and of course operate the spaceships and the blenders and TV's etc. Or maybe they were only built to provide the resources needed to build pyramids which would then provide resources to build more pyramids.Please, there are a lot of fascinating aspects to Egyptian civilization--this isn't one of them."
2,Pretty boring,This is a great book....IF YOUR A SCIENTIST! Christopher Dunn tries to explain to the reader the technical aspects of the great pyramid and why it would be logical for it to be a power plant. Dunn is a mechanical engineer and writes in a way that only another mechanical engineer would understand. Even though most of this book is tech-speak there are others parts that just rehash old theories. All in all it was a pretty boring book.
3,The Pyramids,"Although I haven't read your book and there is some things in there I agree with . I can share from my rememberance that the pyramids hold wisdom, light and love. Truth as one may say. This is in my rememberance. Osiris is part of it and there are others. Yes, some say this place is a generator. All I can share true in a way it was/is. As far as the building of it there were no techniques we as humans would know of. You remember the Stonehedge and how they were moved. In either case I recommend this book to read. Discern what is truthful to you. It may not be to another."
2,far fetched,"This book brings up a number of interesting unexplained facts about the pyramid. The author theorizes that the pyramid was used as a giant hydrogen power generator. Is sounds rather interesting, but several unexplained leaps are made. When he explained that it required a signal from space, and anti-matter in the subterranean chamber to counter the effect of gravity in order to work, he lost me."
4,"Good in some ways, bad in others","[Previous comments deleted after author pointed out errors.]If you want to understand more of what the pyramids actually did, read Platonic and Pythagorean philosophy--as a start. Both Plato and Pythagoras were mentored by Egyptian Mystery priests who still understood the ancient technology in greater ""detail,"" but don't assume that this detail is quite what you're use to. There is a difference between knowledge and understanding. Dunn has a great deal of knowledge, but true understanding is an inner exploration."
5,A compelling case of reverse engineering indeed!,"90% of the book was quite solid, scientific literature. This is the first real attempt to apply truly rational tests as to the function and form of the Great Pyramid. This subject could definitely be expounded upon.A couple of weak points revolving around Cayce, magnetic elevation, stellar radiation, and laser transmission could have been shored up a bit more.What I would like to see is an incorporation of some of LaViolettes ideas about galactic superwaves and radiation bombardment into his part on the explosion and destruction of the various pyramids.Also, I would like to have heard more about the scientific communities reaction to magnetizing stone, and how realistic is. Have there been any tests? Why is it such a mystery?In general, an engaging read and refreshing when compared to all the other New Age hype."
5,Great Collection,"Bought this for a class and couldn't put it down. A mixture of essays divided into several categories: The Experience of War, The Ethics of War, The Causes of War, Strategy, as well as sections of war history divided into essays on Total and Limited war. Truly a cross section of war information, the excerpts, memoirs, and essays are very short-- most only a few pages, but always enough to get a clear understanding of the author's point or experience. Wonderful resource for any military or history buff and a great place to start for anyone who's merely interested."
1,horrible for school kids way over sexed!,This video was way over sexed! I did't see this as a great video to show to students or my kids do to the graphic and over sexed images!
5,"Elevated in style, powerful in imagination","Reviewer: A reader from Metz, FranceNormally I don't read modern poems. They pretend to be highly artistic - but they are only a combination of an eccentric poet and incomprehensible and pretentious stammering and stuttering. ""Strange Gods, Bulk Prophecies"" is different. Strong lines go to the bottom of your heart, a well-considered range of metaphors and symbols combined with a brilliant linguistic competence and the knowledge about the power of words lead you to the poet's message. He IS the greatest living poet! I have never read anything that clear and precise. This is far beyond ordinary."
1,never again,"I loved the books, hated the movies. I know you ask for twenty words,but what else can I say if I had viewed the films first I wood have missed reading a couple of very enjoyable books"
3,consider the history,"This book was written in 1968, and does have interesting things to tell us about sexual mores and behaviors both at that point in time and even now, almost 40 years later. I do think it's important to read books like this and compare how much has changed in our society, in our attitudes toward homosexuality, in the awareness and heightened visibility of the queer population, and various behaviors that people engage in. American society alone has seen the issues and feelings and opinions regarding homosexuality become the subject of fierce debate, Supreme Court decisions, congressional discussion, unwilling health care revolution, fodder for jokes and sitcoms and popular TV shows.... So, when you read this, be aware of historical context."
3,Disappointed,"This advertizes that the Crosroad DVD comes with this concert DVD. That is the reason why I ordered it. This was false advertising there was no additional DVD of the Crossroads enclosed. I went thru the concert DVD, checked the specials, and bonus features and did not find it on the DVD. I won't buy from this seller again. I alread have the CD of this concert. I wanted the Crossroads DVD."
4,"My 4 year old sings, ""Lost my way... HEY HEY""","Just wanted to note for diehard fans that I got this dvd at Target today and the Target version has ""exclusive content: includes 6 live bonus tracks from Stripped: Raw & Real"".Got this for my husband's birthday; he's been a fan forever. I learned to appreciate them through him. We saw one of the concerts at the Prudential center and had a great time, really enjoyed the show and the fans. Now our boys are growing up and singing along too."
3,wrong DVD,"I bought this dvd after someone mentioned there was a stripped version of Hallelujah ( supposedly there were three songs )on the bonus. I triple checked, it wasn't there. Though deeply disappointed, the concert was still worth watching. I wonder if there are 2 different version of Lost Highway DVD ? Please, if anyone knows...is there any Bon jovi dvd with the sripped version of Hallelujah i could get ?"
2,Bon Jovi,I bought this dvd because i really like Bon Jovi but it is of no good to me and will not be buying any more from other countries i have to have a zone 4 and they do not state what zone they are
4,fantastic,"Well what can I say i'm from jersey and have always been a Bon Jovi die hearted fan. I enjoyed the dvd alot and it gives you that fall vibe more. It rocks, the sound quality is awesome and it's worth your money."
3,"Bon Jovi ""live album""","I bought this for my wife who is a die-hard Bon Jovi junkie. Let me just say if you are looking for a ""concert"". This isn't the video for you.This is Bon Jovi playing the entire new album ""lost highway"" in front of an audience.Now don't get me wrong it is still an excellent performance, but if you are looking for the music he plays LIVE all the time, this isn't the DVD for you (there are many others like that).They sound good, and according to my wife he looks good. So Pick this DVD up if you LOVE the new album and want to hear it performed live."
3,Lost Highway,Kind of boring really. It is the preview of the songs prior to the tour. The audience is not really into it either. I'd hold out for the documentary they are filming.
2,Bon Jovi The Lost Highway the Concert DVD,"Looked more like music videos strung together. First DVD I have purchased that didn't come with song info like words, author..."
4,George Perez' Puzzle How awesome is that?,"This is based of George Perez's art from Avengers volume three. It includes everyone who had ever been an avenger as of that time. If you like comics, then you can't beat a puzzle with perez art."
4,"Great ""INTERMEDIATE to ADVANCED"" book","I know I'm not supposed to comment on other reviews but I can't help myself. I have to ask, if you don't understand what ""Zip"" is, or how to use the pen tool, what the heck are you buying an intermediate to advanced book for?On to the book. It is a huge book for a design book, it has tons of examples and inspiration. Ms. London knows her subject and teaches it well. If you at least know the basics of Illustrator you will do fine with this book. In fact her teaching style is so easy to understand that if you have a good grasp using design software you'll do fine.Some of the topics are: appling transparencies, using Live Effects, using layers and of course the drawing tools. There is a good bit of focus on the newer features of Illustrator 9"
4,Ilustrator 9 f/x & Design,Great book....may not be the best choice for beginners....loaded with info.
1,"ehh, avoid this one",I wish that other review had been here before I ordered this for Christmas. Full of holes.
1,Confusing,"As a long time user of Illustrator and Corel Draw, I was very disappointed with this book. It's going on the shelf where it will probably stay for a long time."
1,Zipidy do da,"I'll be brief.The book looks good on the surface,however, it didn't mention the fact somewhere on the front cover that the tutorials on the cd are zip files. I opened the readme file and it says I need an unzipper i.e. WinZip 8.0 I paid $50.00 for the book, now it looks like I'll have to fork over some more dough to purchase this unzip program whom I have never heard of let alone how much it costs. I think I got shafted."
4,Best Theme Album since....,"Jakki just recently got a deal with Babygrande Records off the buzz off this album.This is the best Theme Album since Sticky Fingaz - Blacktrash. The basic gist is God and Satan battling it out and using Jakki as their pawn. Satan sets up a series of scenarios to make Jakki trip-up morally...Satan is trying to test Jakki's belief in God.Without spoiling the album, Satan's scenarios vary from battling with Aliens, to battling with AIDS.With production from RJD2, Camu Tao, Copywrite, and more, this album was set to be a hit. But the focus (as with most theme albums) was primarily on the lyrical content, and the ideas. Jakki's lyrics are great, with intelligent use of metaphors and ideas.If you liked Sticky Fingaz's theme album, you should love this. Although it doesnt follow the same story as Sticky's, this is definately a good break from the normal hip hop we've been hearing recently. Good underground music."
3,"Cute, but not quite as pictured","I like this mobile, it definitely keeps my baby occupied so I can change him! However, the colors are NOT as pictured!! They're very bright, florescent colors, not like what it shows. Also, it looks like it costs about 2 dollars to make.... it just has kind of a cheap feel to it."
5,Makes my baby boy smile from ear to ear!,"My 3 1/2 month old son is just starting to smile, but he doesn't smile at most toys. This changing table mobile is the main exception. He absolutely beams when he sees it dangling above his changing table, and he used to HATE getting changed there. He even coos and giggles at the lion. I would love to bring it with us everywhere...the lion must be magical to him! Plus, it doesn't need batteries...YAY for that!"
1,Cheap but Overpriced Toy,"Look cheapo and flimsy. One tug, it was torn. For the price that I've paid for it, I could have gotten a much better one with extra ten dollars. Dont buy it."
5,better than the traditional jewel cases,"I love these, the hard plastic jewel cases that we used in the past were always cracking or breaking, hated them. These new cases are wonderful and the slimness is great, takes up less space. I would definitely recommend this product. My husband loves them for his writable computer discs. Great product."
5,I Love These Things,"These are the best ever jewel cases. I bought these many years ago, but now they're nearly impossible to find in retail stores. Thankfully Amazon has them.Pros:' They keep your CDs and DVDs completely dust free.' They stack nicely.' They are nearly impossible to break; I've even stepped on them with no breakage or damage to my disks.' They're probably even microwavable although I wouldn't recommend it (and I'm sure the manufacturer wouldn't either).Cons:' You can't put inserts in them.That said, I wish I'd bought the 200 pack."
5,PRDIGM REVIEW,I travel a lot between countries and carry CD/DVDs with me. I also cut CD/DVDs (all legitimate) which need to be sent to others and these cases are absolutely ideal for packing and mailing off.
4,"A well researched, origianl view of life in America in 1776","James Schouler's work is an original study of life and manners, social, industrial and political for the revolutionary period. Newspapers, magazines and diaries were his primary resources for this study. Presenting a broad spectrum of information on daily life, Schouler overviews dress, pastimes, fashion, family homes, homelife, literature, the colonial press, religion, music, theater, etiquette, medicine, storms and other hazards to life in the colonies. A great introductory work on this period."
1,Convenient but not good for hummingbirds!!,"This product might be convenient, but I recommend NOT using it. It contains red dye and a preservative, both of which may be damaging to hummingbirds. You do not need red food coloring in nectar in order to attract hummingbirds. Most hummingbird feeders have plenty of red on them to attract the birds. A simple mixture of 4 parts water to 1 part granulated sugar is all that is needed for hummingbird nectar. Never use honey or sugar substitutes. It's simple to make nectar and keep refrigerated and certainly safe for the birds. We prefer safeguarding the health of these little birds rather than the supposed convenience of this product."
1,RED DYE may cause tumors,"There is some scientific testing showing red dye may cause tumors in hummingbirds. Why take a chance? The red is just marketing. PLEASE don't fall for marketing. Plain white sugar is better for the birds and your wallet.Makes you angry that the company cares more about looks than the birds lives, doesn't it?Makes me angry to see people ignoring the warnings."
1,A no-good and obviously hazardous to humming birds!!!,"I bought this ""Red Hummingbird Nectar"" and did, unfortunately, research afterwards. I found out that this hummingbird food is absolutely rubbish. You should not buy it. It contains dye and preservatives which are harmful for hummingbirds. I do not get it, first we destroy their habitats and than we feed them something what makes them sick and kills them in the long-run.You could mix your own hummingbird nectar, 1 part sugar and 4 parts waterheat it up until the sugar is dissolved. Very cheap and healthier.Here is a good website and a good download.[...]Oh, I just found out that I have to rate them one star to post a review. There should be minus stars!!!"
2,RED DYE#40,"I gave this two stars only because I had to assign a rating to make this comment. I have not used the nectar and the rating is mere speculation. I am wondering if FDA Red#40 is the same as Red Dye 40 (red food dye). Most birding experts advise against using red dyes in hummingbird nectar. There is some evidence that these dyes cause tumors and other health problems in hummingbirds. If the concentrate contains red food dye, I wouldn't use it. It's not necessary to use red coloring in nectar to attract hummingbirds; the red in the feeder is sufficient."
4,great gift,i picked this out to give my grandma with a new hummingbird feeder for Christmas. it's a great add on so she can quickly make new water.
5,Hummer's Love It,This is the first product I have ever found for the Hummingbirds that works like nature. The guys flock to the feeder. Now have hummers year round.
1,Chemicals for your flying jewels,"Hummingbirds are wonderful flying jewels and it's a real treat to have them come to your home to feed. Having red on your hummingbird feeder is enough to attract them; having red chemical dye in their food is totally, and I mean totally, unecessary. They will readily take clear nectar made of only table sugar (1 part) and water (4 parts) and it won't hurt them. Red coloring may hurt them. Now you don't want to do that do you?"
1,way over priced,"you can get this in any store for half the price. nothing special about it, the packets you mix yourself are just as effective"
1,gave my fish finrot,"i had smaller tanks with a small bioload. it gave my fish finrot. in the other tank i didnt have it in there as long and the finrot isnt as bad.didnt have issues before adding purigen.i tested my water and it was fine. it seems that whatever it did to my water, there wasnt a test for it.my once beautiful fish are now raggy ;[maybe just get this stuff if you have a big bioload and a messy tank.i just wanted a filter media that i wouldnt have to keep repurchasing.this is an expensive purchase for me since i've bought the purigen and several extra bags for it."
5,Great filtering chemical,Use this in my XP3 on a 65G. For the bulk just use a mesh bag or some old pantyhose.Pros:- Renewable- Easy to tell when it needs to be cleaned- Much cheaper than carbon because you can re-use itCons:- Fine pellets can be messy so be careful!
4,Excellent product,"These amazing beads really clean up my aquarium tank to a clear crystal quality. It would be nice though if the manufacturer had included instructions on how to clean and recycle the beads (I had to call customer service to find out). Also a pouch to put this stuff in would be nice. Tried it with my wife's old nylon panty hose; after several uses, the nylon breaks up due to the bleaching agent required for cleaning. Overall though, the product is truly amazing. I gave up using charcoal filter altogether. Your fish will be happy too."
5,clear up water perfect,"I had issues with wood tanned water, this polished my water great, crystaline water. You will need to get ""The Bag"" since purigen is very fine (almost powder) or some type of fine mesh bag. Regeneration is simple just make sure to use good declorinator before putting back into tank. Highly recomended."
5,Fish World,"Amazing stuff polishes water, ammonia, nitrates,nitrites at 0. I've never seen anything like it andwould highly recommend its use especially if you have anoverstocked tank. The fish love it and are visiblymore active and playful."
2,The granules are too fine. Need special bag to hold them.,I used the little stone version and it works fine. This version is just too fine and you need to get some special bag to hold them.
3,hmm,"Not sure this is even working, but the water is infact clearer then it has ever been before. Dont regret the purchase but not sure its working."
3,THIS IS NOT BASED ON DRAGONBALL Z,"Unlike most peole who watch this movie, I know it is based on the Chinese legend, and not the manga created by Akira Toriyama. Eventually Toriyama chose to make Goku an alien and break away from the legend. That aside this is an interesting movie, but nothing spectacular. If you are a DBZ fan however, you should check it out if you want to know what the series was originally based on."
3,Not what you Expect,"All in all it is not that good movie. It is a fun kung-fu movie. But it is not Sleeping Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It actually has almost nothing to do with Dragon Ball. The film is not based on DBZ so don't expect incredible fights. The film is based on the Chinese legends Dragon Ball was based on. It is an action movie with some humor. Thats all. If you expect more you'll be sorry. Many people gave the movie terrible reviews. They obvisously knew nothing about the Movies history. It's Different, it's mediocre, but you might enjoy it."
2,Dragonball : Where's the magic?,"When I first heard this live action Dragonball movie was coming out I was more then apprehensive. Now I know why people say you should trust your gut. I don't think anyone but true fans of the show will even buy this, however, I don't think anyone, know matter who you are, will enjoy this. The story is ludicrous. It is basically a summary of the first season of Dragonball Z with some characters missing. In summation, the truest fans of the show will enjoy this for the comedy, but the magic of watching a small goateed man with a shell on his back try to jump on a flying cloud doesn't last that long. Look somewhere else."
2,No where near the real thing...,The only people that should ever buy this movie are true fans of DBZ. And just to let you know this movie does not take place in the begging of dragon ball it takes place at the end that is why Goku is in the orange outfit it is not a DB-DBZ combo. The people that play in the movie don't look like the anime at all! The only reson I bought this is because I have seen all other Dragon Ball Z things there are to see and I thought it was worth a laugh! Ha Ha....
1,bah,"This is a mega cheesy movie, my little brother is a DBZ freak and he couldnt watch the whole thing.I can not believe I bought this garbage, save your money."
1,The dumbest thing I&#65533;ve ever seen.,"This movie is just totally pathetic. Anyone with high standards should stay away from it. On the other hand, if you're a big fan of Dragonball or Dragonball Z and you think it would be fun to watch some low budget butchering of a decent anime you should defiantly buy it now."
3,Summary off the back of the box,"Hi, I noticed Amazon.com gave no summary so I'll retype the one off the back of the box here.Summary: The evil King Sizkrath possesses two of the seven Dragon Pearls and needs the remaining five to rule the world. The battle for the pearls commences between King Sizkrath and his minions Zebrata and Malila, and the five heroes who must stop them. A completely live-action film based on the popular Japanese animated series, featuring all the action and specialeffects you could want."
