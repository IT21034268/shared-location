2,Norpro Mugs,Cups were not as big as I expected; however looked good. The unfortunate thing is they arrived broken. So I believe they should have been packaged better. They were a Christmas present for someone so had to come up with something else.
4,Large coffee cups,These were a bit too lager for me so I sent them back. If you are looking for a very large cup this is it.
2,Trash delivered within our mugs.,"The mugs arrived right in time and safely.However, when I opened the box there was something I did not expect to see. It was a trash of a chewing gum, which I think came all the way from China. Please look at the photo below.[...]Since the item itself had no problem and I will thoroughly wash it before use, I didn't request for return or anything. But I really want Amazon/everyone to know about this. We were very unpleasent to find someone's trash in our mugs."
2,Large white mug,Basic white soup mug with a handle. I am using them for soup but would not purchase these again nor would I recommend them. I would rather have corelle than glazed ceramic. Too wide a rim to be used as a large coffee cup.
5,Plenty of room for foamy milk,"Thank you for the positive reviews. I LOVE these mugs. The handle doesn't get too hot after microwaving for 45 seconds like some pottery mugs so I can preheat the milk first. I only bought 2 the first time so I could check them out, and I bought more today. I've looked everywhere for plain 16 oz cups and they're only in college bookstores."
2,Very Disappointed !,"I am sooooo disappointed in this cd, It is just music, & not very good at that, how do I know it is Tex Ritter? I wanted a cd that had the songs & words & music. Besides that it is suppose to be in new condition, very disappointed to say the least. N. Greenwell"
5,Excellent unit for homeowner,"I bought mine factory reconditioned from GleemPaint.com for a VERY good price and received the unit in 2 days. My previous sprayer was a Wagner Power Pro (hand buzzer) and the 9150 is way, WAY superior. Since it's advertised as an entry level ""contractor grade"" sprayer, I expect it to last a fairly long time since it will only get occasional use plus most ""wearable parts"" are replacable. The tip size helps control the paint flow and spray pattern, so you may need more than one tip for handling different jobs. I'm VERY satisfied with both the unit and GleemPaint."
4,great Cd,"enjoyed the cd,***********************so Im just typing now, sorry...alazon's policy for these reviews is crazy!!!! Have to post a certain amount of words please...."
5,Eiffel candy pop mold,Made of good quality plastic. Very durable easy to handle.Made lovely chocolate pops for a baby shower. Hand wash was easy set on dish drain.
3,Cute and easy,"I am not the most crafty, and bought these to make lollipops for my best friends bridal shower. I didn't even attempt to use two different colors of chocolate, I just poured one color in there, banged out the bubbles and froze for a few minutes. Worked great. 1 bag of chocolate melts from Michael's made 9 pops. Finding bags that fit was a little difficult because of the lollipop height, but they looked great when all completed, and everyone loved them."
5,LOVE THIS SET!,"MY 3 YEAR OLD SON RECIEVED THIS SET FOR HIS BIRTHDAY AND HE LOVES IT! WE USE THE GREEN STORAGE COMPARTMENT FOR ALL OF HIS ART SUPPLIES. IT HAS WHEELS SO IT'S EASY TO PULL IN AND OUT. WHEN HE GETS CRAYON ON IT, ALL WE NEED IS A LITTLE BIT OF PLEDGE AND IT COMES RIGHT OFF. I LOVE THE FACT THAT IT FITS TOGETHER LIKE A PUZZLE. IT'S GREAT FOR SMALL SPACES!"
3,Cute but has bad fumes,"My husband purchased this table, and it actually wasn't super-easy to set up like people said. It took him about an hour, possibly more. And he is handy. A lack of actual words and explanations in the instructions isn't helpful to putting KidKraft toys together, even though they are nice wooden pieces.But my biggest complaint is what smells like toxic paint fumes off gassing from this product. We possibly purchased the table on backorder, so KidKraft may have recently constructed and painted this item, which means the new paint smell is strong. But I am worried about my 2 yo daughter being exposed to these fumes, so I am looking into returning the product. It's too bad b/c she likes it, and my husband is very proud of it, but I am more concerned about my daughter's health than another additional toy cluttering the house. I am not sure what kind of paint they used, but I am defn. going to look for natural, non-toxic items for the baby in the future."
4,Great for the price.,"I purchased this set because my SIL owns one, and so far it has lasted for over 4 years.My kids are fairly rough on things, so I'm not sure that I would expect mine to last that long.It is a very attractive little set, and the quality is great for the price.It's made from a pressed wood, which IMO is a little ""soft"" (easy to dent). But a set that is well taken care of should be able to stand the test of time.My kids are aged 9,7,5, and 2. All of them can fit at the table, although I would say that it is more suited for my 2 and 5 year old.The little storage box is adorable and very handy.It was a CINCH to put together. It took less than half an hour. (Always plus in my book!)Overall, it's a great set and I would recommend it to anyone with preschool aged children, especially for the price!"
2,Poor Quality Great Service,"When this table arrived, it looked as though something very large and heavy had been dropped on it, and it was soaking wet. Needless to say the table inside was no longer useable, the pressboard construction just can't handle that kind of hard useage. Amazon was awesome however, they even paid the return shipping through UPS for me and apologized that the item arrived in such poor condition. I won't purchase this item again however as even the areas of the table that were unaffected by the delivery problems were of very poor quality with paint chips and many dings on the surfaces."
5,Solid Purchase,This table was really easy to put together and looks great. The benches are stable enough for my toddler to get in and out of in his own clumsy way. He loves the bin.
3,Kids Table with Benches,This is a nice table but I have a pretty strong toddler and he was able to break it within a few days. Nice for the price and does not take long to put together.
1,Horrible quality.,"We ordered this table set for our two year old. Not only did it take quite a bit of time to assemble, but the quality of the product is horrible. The hardware that comes with it is very low quality also. I would NOT reccomend this product to anyone."
4,Kids work table,"Very good quality work table for kids.Very durable,easy to assemble and looks good.Size is perfect for a small home.Storage to keep toys is an additional plus point.I am very happy with the purchase.Best price on Amazon!!"
5,KidKraft table,Our Grandson loves the table! He uses it every day.have a great day. There is nothing else to say. Great table!
5,Great product - easy to assemble,This product is of a high quality for the price and easy to assemble. The storage box is very handy...my grandkids love it!!!
5,Nice Table,"Very pleased with this table, it was easy to assemble. I like the space saving design and how stable the chairs and table are. My 18 month old boy still struggles to get on the chairs but no matter how much he pushes on them, they just won't tip over like the ones we had. If anything, my only problem now is keeping him from standing on them since he figured that he can get away with that. My only improvement to this table would be a lip, so small items suchs as crayons don't roll off. Overall this is a keeper."
2,Broken within 24 hours,"I really wanted to love this table, but for one thing it was MUCH smaller than I thought it was going to be, and my oversized 2 year old dwarfs it already. More importantly, it was broken within 24 hours. My son leaned on the top and it broke leaving us with a completely unstable table unless my husband feels like trying to fix it somehow."
4,Great compact kids table!,"Love everything about this table..colors, material, shape. It is the perfect size for eating and/or playing and pushes together neatly when all is said and done. The only complaint I have is the screws in the table do not hold very well and ended up having to use wood glue along with the screws to keep it sturdy. Other than that I would highly recommend to someone looking for a kids table that is stylish and compact."
1,Rubbish,"We purchased a PS2 (Hello Kitty) mouse for our daughter and had to get this adapter so that she could use it on her computer, but the mouse doesn't work and after hours of trying to figure it out (i.e. researching the internet and trying it on different computers) it seems that the adapter just does not work. I was going to return it to Computer Brain, but their returns policy requires that we pay for return shipping, which will cost us more than the adapter itself!! (And we already paid over $8 in shipping to get it here in the first place) I am NOT impressed, and will not be using Computer Brain in the future."
1,didn't work,The startech adapter didn't work on my dell vostro 1700.The TRENDnet USB to PS/2 Converter worked first time every time.
1,it does not work,The converter does not work at all. Windows does not even see the device when it plugs in. Why would you try to make a few dollars by wasting other people's time.
5,Taos Tales,Robert Mirabal is an exceptional artist. The stories he tells in his music and songs are wonderfully portrayed. The tunes that he creates is very relaxing and sothing.
3,dissapointing cd,"My first contact with Mirabal's performance is not good. The first track on this CD is very good, but then comest the bad rest. Second track is actually promising but spoiled by the vocal. Some other tracks resemble tre native Indians' tribal chanting. Uneven CD, don't know if it was supposed to be new age or world music or whatever."
4,Taos Tales,Another great piece of work from Mirabal. Close your eyes and you can find yourself in another place and time. A song for all moods. A must have!
2,Useless for a novice gardener,"I found this book very frustrating and difficult to use. As a beginner it was especially difficult because the common names of plants are not cross-referenced. Not everything is illustrated and the items referenced are not always next to the photo of said item so that I was never really sure which plant on a page was which. Written in arcane horticultural jargon, this book is clearly for the experienced gardener only."
3,from the front row live-jerry lee lewis,"I love SACD and DVD-A. However this 5.1 didn't quite do the trick. Sadly it wasn't the mix that was off, it was the performance.J. Guida"
2,"Front row, back row; no difference","My fault for not reading the special notes relating to this beingan Audio DVD only. You have to play it on a DVD player; it won't work on a CD player; if you watch the video while listening all you see is pictures of the killer playing and they even repeat themselves.The songs are done well in the live setting and the sound is good but without any action to watch while listening, it's a big disapointment. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to see Jerry live. He isn't. Why would they bother to put this on a DVD anyway. A CD would at least give you more options for listening. Not worth the price!"
3,Psychotic outerspace dub style!,"This release by Creation Rebel was actually recorded in 1978 and not released until 1980 and was still ahead of its time. Drummer Style Scott went on to the influential Root Radics band that was a staple of Scientist and Mikey Dreads hugely successful dub-ish albums. The outing on this cd is separated in 10 parts, with odd reversals and noodlings. Way ahead of its time, thanks to Andrian Sherwood. If you are interested in Creation Rebel, skip Psychotic Jonkanoo and go for this one! Psychotic Jonkanoo is very rootsy while Starship Africa is a dub band in outer space. Essential headphone listening!"
4,WD HD,"I wanted a internal drive to enclose in a external case in this case an Antec, to store pictures and video's from my Sanyo HD camera. I found both the drive and the case to be just what I wanted. I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that the software would not let me format in Fat 32. It plugs into my Hd TV with the Sanyo software and works perfect."
5,"THE Rock record of 2003, period.","Zakk, just takes it once again to another level of songwriting, mind blowing musicality, and true rock n' roll vibe and attitude on this last record. Zakk Wylde might be one the last great American guitar heroes, the true successor of the greatly missed Randy Rhoads. If you don't get to feel it straight away, it's because it might be deeper than some of the other things you're listening to these days.. Give it some time and it will grow in you, and you'll end up drinking beer, headbanging like crazy, singing all the words and playing air guitar. Don't be a looser, just buy this album, and join the club of the rockers who are in the know! You thought Metallica and Pantera were heavy, you heard nothing yet."
5,ONE OF ZAKK'S BEST!!,"The blessed hell ride is an awesome cd. Every song is spectacular! As of right now, the blessed hell ride is my favorite black label society cd! Zakk's guitar playing is spectacular in this cd! Every thing is just awesome!"
4,Zakk fans will be happy with this CD,"This is a great new album from Zakk. The vibe is more open than on 1919 Eternal but still heavy. There are lots of great riffs and solos. If you are a BLS fan, I don't know what more you could ask for."
5,Blazing,"when BLS plays you know what your getting...heavytunes with some attitude..no shortage of skill, when it comes to Zakk Wylde."
4,Awesome CD!!!,"The Blessed Hellride is a fresh breath a METAL in sad times of crappy music. Not to say that EVERYTHING nowadays sucks, but most of it doesn't compare to The Blessed Hellride. I like the heaviness, musicality ( choice of ear-pleasing note combinations ) and the killer SOLOS, too. The world needs more guitar solos! Keep 'em coming! Zakk Wylde rules!!!!!"
3,"Good, but not better than the last: 3 Stars.","I was really looking forward to this after the last release of 1919 eternal's blistering jams: not the same supercharged band.Zakk's playing seems a bit less than the last outing, and the songs less catchy; but, leave it to this guy to make you still keep it in your CD rack for an opener on nights when cold beer is on ice. It's one of those perfect CD's to 'get you in the partying mood' for the next 5 CD's you have waiting in the wings to be cranked full volume.3 stars for a pleasant jam, it just lacked the songwriting and steroid-like energy that 1919 Eternal had.3 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF METAL, USA."
5,YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If love guitar driven, straight ahead Rock & Roll, look no further. This cd has what you crave in spades!!Zakk continues to pump out great tunes that groove big time. This is less southern rock sounding than some of his past stuff, but I don't care, Zakk plays a mean guitar and writes great tunes and that's what it's all about!"
5,Oh Yeah!,"Black Label Society just keeps getting better and better with the last two releases. In fact, the BLS album I like the least (Stronger Than Death) still gets three stars. The riffs on Blessed are some of the coolest, freshest, dopest that Mr. Wylde has put on record. If you like [great]hard rock and roll, this record is for you!"
5,"Thor of Rock, only Wylder!","Ever since I learned Zakk was going solo in another group, I was worried. I must admit I did not really care for Pride and Glory...I am not much of a Southern Rock Fan..sorry. But hey, with a name of Black Label Society, you got to take a sniff, right? Well pull out the damn smelling salts because someone has really pissed Mr. Wylde off! His music sounds just, well, pretty damn incredible. I got to catch him here at South Paw's in Shreveport, LA in a small venue and let me tell you, I enjoyed that show more than any I have ever been to! The man really does deserve the ranking net to Dime-bag. And this new album...all I can say, if you don't check it out, get off your ... and do so! If you have never heard of Wylde, it is about time to open yourself to what rock is and not this nu-metal ... that no one seems able to play a solo anymore. All I can say is Zakk, if you ever read this, figure out how to live forever because you are the very hope of hard rock!"
4,Much more polished production!,"To be totally honest I was not blown away by 1919 Eternal aside of a few cool songs like ""Genocide Junkies"",""Life,birth,blood,doom"",""Bleed for me"",and ""One more bridge to cross"".Too dark and gloomy tends to sum up my opinion on most of the songs.On Hellride,however,the fog has lifted.Zakks guitar sounds so powerful,more so than I can ever remember.He doesn't try to oversing in that lower register as he did so much in 1919 eternal.Stoned and Drunk just blows me away with the sound of his guitar.I can't put the volume up loud enough on this song!Funeral Bell,Stillborn,Suffering Overdue are some of my other favorites.Hellride and Stronger Than Death are his two best efforts in my opinion.This one is a keeper."
4,No surprises here,"The new black label societ album holds no surprises for the avid fan of Zakk Wylde. This album strikes me as a logical followup to 1919 eternal. It is more of a hard rock album than metal, especially compared to the first two BLS releases. Zakk's voice sounds like a mix of ozzy and alice in chains. The guitar playing on the cd is fantastic, as one would expect, and still has a metal edge, just listen to the riff from the opening track. To sum it up, if you already like BLS, you're probably going to like this album as it is not a far cry from anything else he has done, with the exception of it being more hard rock than metal. But then 1919 was more hard rock than metal too. Anyway, buy the album."
5,Brilliant stuff from the maestro,"BLS are keeping real metal alive: Zakk Wylde has finally produced the album of his career - 'The Blessed Hellride' is one kick-ass metal/hard rock album, and as long as you like true rock and appreciate guitar genius you will love it. ZW has succeeded in showing emotion through his solo's, instead of making listeners think 'he's shredding AGAIN'. But don't get me wrong the solo's still are fast paced shred fests, but this time with that missing element. With other BLS albums, some songs really didn't stand out, but on 'The Blessed Hellride' every track is brilliant. From 'Stillborn' featuring the Prince Of Darkness himself through to the country-style-twanging of 'Dead Meadow' this album sticks up to its title - its one hell of a ride which for no doubt many countless fans, new and old, will never end."
4,Best place to start in terms of Zakk Wylde's wizardry ...,"Mastery of chunky riffs, I was hooked to 'Stillborn' immediately after I saw rose from the Mainstream chart of Billboard.com. Cost was 17.99 and no regrets. It is a strange brew considering the first time I heard and saw this strange man in a spread eagle pose? Go back to 1991. No More Tears ring any bells because that was no other than Ozzy Osbourne in da flesh! Then after Osmosis, something f+cked. Less than three years later, he named himself and his 'back-up' band, Black Label Society. This was for the curious-minded @ heart. So don't mind reading this review over and over. Just expressing my thoughts in retro-time ..."
2,What Happened Zakk,"Alrite, this is hard me to say but i didn't like the blessed hellride. After 1919 eternal [wa so good] i was expsecting something faster, crazier, and heavy ... And with an awesome name like the Blessed Hellride I thought the song itself would at the least not be acoustic. All I gotta say is I miss songs like Battering Ram, Genocide Junkies, 13 Years of Grief and Low Down. Bleed Black Label"
1,Sold back within a Week,"Simply put, the only song worthwile is STILLBORN, the rest of the album sounds like that group of idoits who play with their ""band"" in the garage down the road. You would call the cops, but then again you feel bad about how much they suck and decide they need to spend that time practicing."
1,terrible at best,"Zakk Wylde is a man that demands perfection in the music of others. It then comes as a surprise that he doesn't practice what he preaches. While he is an amazing guitarist, his songwriting is downright horrible. His chord progressions are mediocre, songs are repetetive, and his guitar solos are repeated flurries of predictable pentatonics with no melody. In other words, his solos sacrifice substance for style. He never allows his band to have any instrumental time of their own. They are more or less hired guns. That is why it's called Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society. This album's poor quality is further augmented by the fact that Wylde cannot sing. He blatantly tries to rip off both Ozzy Osbourne and Pantera's own Phil Anselmo with horrendous results. He has no tone control and at times, sounds like he is yawning while he is singing. If you want real heavy metal with great vocals and/or melodic guitar solos, check out Metallica, Fear Factory, Pantera, Tool, and Shadows Fall."
2,Disappointed,"After listening to Zakk for the past 5 years my enthusiasem has dropped with each cd and with the latest concoction Blessed Hellride my expectations are at an all time low. Sure he can still shred with the best of them but the fact is Zakk can do so much better. In his latest two cds ""1919"" and ""Blessed Hellride"" Zakk has lost his most admireable attribute, his melody. It seems that these days he's more concerned with kicking everyones ass rather than writing good songs with good melodies. If you want to hear a good Zakk Wylde cd check out Pride and Glory, Book of Shadows, Sonic Brew, or Stronger than Death. But if all you want is mindless bone crushing metal without much substance go ahead and check out Blessed Hellride. Even the lyrics blow - ""the worms and maggots gather for the feast""What the hell?..."
3,"good content, but too boring for the dad-to-be","This book was a great way to tell my husband we were expecting, but after that it didn't get much use. The content is solid, but very dry -yawn!"
3,BE SURE YOU GET THE NON-OCR VERSION,"Some editions of this book were created by automatic Optical Character Recognition software, and since the original text is old, the software had difficulty reading many places and generated garbled text and stray markings. Be sure you get a non-OCR version!"
5,Love this book,This is one of the first books I got on preserving and it is the one I turn to the most. It has more jam recipes using honey than any other book I have found and I like all the other non canning parts of the book too. It isn't the be all and end all of canning but if you want a great book with many forms of preserving food this is the one for you.
5,Prepared,Good book for giving the basics on how to prepare for a hard winter or just stocking up for hardtimes.
4,Very helpful book,I found this book to be very helpful. It tells when to harvest as well as how best to preserve the produce from my garden.
1,the food police,"Beware, in this third edition, the author has decided that you should not have salt, nitrates, sugar or vinegar, these are staple ingredients for food preservation.Because of this, the chapter on preserving and smoking meat has been deleted. Also, many of the pickle recipes have been much altered for the worse. Additionally, imagine the preserves and jellies without sugar (honey as a substitute) . I feel I have been cheated by not being informed of these changes in the description of this book.If a cookbook author decides to set themselves up as the food police, they should inform you of that fact up front. I find the book useless. I am still looking for a real food preservation book."
5,One of the greatest games ever concieved!,"This is an incredible game. With addictive gameplay and fantastic creatures, this is a great game to bring to a party. This is the kind of game a group of people could play, not only having fun but also taking advantage of the social aspects made available at Dragon Dice matches. This is definitely a game that improves your social interaction with people as well as expands your imagination."
3,Emilia's Best,"Emilia's a great singer but she's song is not very good.A Good Sign,Big big World,Twist of Fate is good but also is not good. Turkish;yi arkc ama o kadar güzel arks yok.."
3,clear and relax,The song is quite clear in world and in music. I feel nothing except fresh when enjoying it.
1,Emilia: I hope I'll never hear another song like this!,"When I first heard the song Big, big world I thought: this is probably the worst song ever written. When I heard the second time I knew I was right: This IS the worst song ever written!"
1,pretty bad,Big big world is the only hit there. You get the impression that she cannot sing and one wonders how someone could do a complete album with her
5,Best CD ever.,If u have never heard of this cd. Please give it a try. I wa in europe then this came out. I loved it and I had my family listen to it and they all love it now too. Wished it was better know in america...
1,disgusting,This must be the most disgusting song i've ever heard. Few songs make me agressive but this one makes me wanna smash my radio... If you like (dont know the title) its all 'bout the money its all about the dum dum dudum dum dum you'll prolly like this one... But then you have an extremely bad taste...DONT BY THIS CD PLEASE!!! IT SUCKS!!!!
4,"It is an all round, heartfull song.","Emilia has a great voice and really shines in this single. ""Big, Big World"" is a song to bring tears to your eyes and make you think about life, which is what a song should do."
2,"Sweet and shallow, like a saucer of milk.","Although Emilia seems sweet, tender and caring for the world's troubles, I don't think she is. This CD shows an admirable naivité about everything the world is about. It is best demonstrated in the monosyllabic monster hit Big Big World - which is an annoying ditty sung by a sweet girl following her producers. That's my opinion. On the other hand, in Europe it's a mega monster seller so why complain? People seem to like this sort of music - shallow as it may be - and they buy them like Big Macs(R). So if you are into Celine Dion-esque romance, Lionel Richie lyrics, Natalia Imbruglia over-producedness, please buy this record. You'll find it excellent."
5,Excellent Contemporary Christian CD with an R&B Flair,"""After All"" is an excellent debut album by dynamic Contemporary Christian Artist, Gary Anglin. It is energetic, alive, encouraging and spreads joy. ""Everlasting"" and ""Clap Your Hands"" are wonderful driving uptempos. Ballads ""Feel The Nails"", ""Heaven Is You"" and ""Jesus Christ Is The Way"" are faithful yet original renditions. While ""Come To The Table"" is excellently performed and serves as a great communion song, ""This Is Our Day"" promises to be a wedding day favorite. The buzz from friends all agree that the CD is a worthwhile purchase; one that you'll listen to again and again,and Gary Anglin is someone to watch."
5,Good product in its line.,I have been giving this vitamin to my son for two years now since he turned 3. He loves it. This vitamin is vital as it contains so necessary D3. Very good flavor. Makes cod liver oil fun!
5,"My kids LOVE their ""ball vitamins""","This product is the best! My children call them 'ball vitamins' and like them so much they remind me to give them to them with their breakfast, and if I run out, they pester me till I get more."
2,son won't try them,"I suppose these might be good if my picky 3 yr old would even try them. He put one in his mouth and it came right back out. I'm now breaking them and putting it in his juice, as he won't even eat yogurt. Guess I'll try the gummy version next time."
1,Made my son sick,"This product made my son sick to his stomach. Also, he said it tasted really gross so I don't think it is truly a chewable pill. My other son didn't take it, he just broke it open and said it was slimy and he wasn't going to eat it. I am going to try a product that uses algae to make the DHA, I think it was the fish oil that bothered my son's stomach."
1,I think they recently changed the formula,"My kids used to love these, but about a month ago, I bought a replenishment bottle and all three of my kids immediately said they didn't like them. I thought I got a bad bottle, so I had a new one shipped no charge and threw the first bottle out. Unfortunately, same result. Not sure if others have had the same experience, but my kids used to have no problem taking these. Now they won't touch them."
2,The boys don't like them,I bought these in hopes that our boys would love them. They can't stand them. I think if they were old enough to swallow them whole they would be fine but once they chewed them they started gagging. I think the product is great but the delivery is difficult unless your child likes to swallow whole.
5,Kids love the taste....,"My 7 year old son has been taking 4 of these for about a little over a year now. It has really helped with his focus and concentration. You can chew them and they taste like strawberry....no fishy taste. He loves them. I love that they help him. Worth the money and peace of mind. People are so quick to use adhd meds, when they should give this a try...I am not a doctor...but it has really helped my son a lot. I would check with the doctor to be sure it is okay. I am thankful for them. Not a miracle cure...but they do help."
5,My daughter loves these,"My 19-month old daughter LOVES these and every morning she asks for her ""popping vitamins"". She chews them and seems to love the taste. I've tried them too - and while I would not say they are delicious, they're not awful."
5,Love 'em!,My 2-year old took to these like 'fish to water' :) She calls them 'candy' and beggs for more. She has no problem chewing them. We don't eat a lot of fish so these are great as a supplement. Highly recommended.
3,She liked it!!,"Got it for a somewhat fussy 8 year old.....I am hoping it will improve my child's concentration and focusing skills, but it has only been a week since it was started - too early to comment!! I will review it again in a couple of months.The 3 stars were for the taste!"
1,Awful- not even chewable,This product is terrible. I chewed one myself and I literally could not get the gel cap to dissolve at all. It tastes like strawberry fish oil so I can't even cut the gel caps open and sneak the oil in things. It felt like chewing up a regular adult fish oil gel capsule that had a slight strawberry taste. In no way are these chewable. I don't know if I got a very old bottle or what. Very frustrating. Does someone know of a trusted seller for this product where the capsules taste good and are chewable? I can't give these to my kids. My girls are too young they need things that are chewable not a pill to swallow. However for how tough that gel cap was I don't even know if it would dissolve in the stomach if it was swallowed whole.
3,"Not really ""chewables"" like a gummy. . .they are oil filled capsules","As long as your child is able to swallow these without chewing they are ok. They don't taste like strawberry, if you chew them they are fishy tasting. My 8 year old daughter will swallow them whole, though, with something to drink."
3,Strawberry flavored?,"I gave it a 3 star because of the flavor. My son does not like these at all but I'll continue to make him take them as I know it will be good for him. They are advertised as strawberry but there isn't a hint of it when you chew these. When he gave me his icky face, I knew something was up so I tried one and wanted to spit it out also. I'm trying to teach him to just swallow instead of chew it but so far he's not getting it. Overall, I know this is a good brand and I trust the vitamin itself."
4,These do not taste good...,"Do not let other reviews fool you - these taste gross. My boys, 7 & 10, swallow them like a pill. Other than that, they provide what I want as a supplement for my kids."
1,softgels are not chewable,"If you are looking for something that your child will chew and swallow, this is not it. I bought this after a reading many reviews and a customer stating this was the only vitamin her picky child would take. Well, these gels are not chewable and my child will not swallow them. I then tried blending them in a smoothie and the gels do not break up; I end up spitting them out. My child won't even touch them. Better to purchase a chewable vitamin next time."
5,Great behavior improvement,"My 7 yr old starting taking fish oil in Kindergarten and they made an amazing difference in his behavior. He has sensory processing disorder and PDD. After taking these, he no longer needed to wear ear plugs in noisy environments, and he stopped perseverating on different things. He no longer had meltdowns and he stopped chasing kids at recess. They have helped him so much."
3,review,"It will be helpful if Amazon can highlight it as ""for 3+ years kids"". I have to return it because of this. Be careful."
2,My children cannot swallow or chew these.,"I have a 4 year old and an 18 mo old. Both of them cannot chew it. The 4 year old can kinda chew it up, but does not get all the medicine out of it, he cannot swallow it either."
2,Not what I expected,I bought these chewables for my 4 year old because he does not take liquid meds or vitamins and try as I might to add the liquid onto his PBJ sandwiches and into his drink mixes he would not touch them. As soon as he put this in his mouth he had the look again. I tried one and it was disgusting-simply an outer shell that wasn't even chewable and a sort of strawberry-flavored slime inside. I wish I had not wasted my money on these and hope that you will not make the same mistake. I will be going back to the liquid and trying to figure out more creative ways to add it to his food/drinks.
2,check your products immediately for bad smell,"Check your gels immediately because all five bottles of my order smelled bad (no strawberry smell), the gels were rock hard and the kids refused to take it even though they have been on this stuff for the last 3 years. I am going to place another order but if it's bad again I will never do business again with this seller and complain to the manufacturer. This from a longtime buyer of this product."
2,Doesn't like the taste,"My 3 year old daughter doesn't like the taste, so it is hard to get her to eat them. It is basically a very small soft gel of fish oil. And it doesn't specify a differing dose amount based on the age of the child."
3,vitamins,I loved the new vitamins and plan to buy them again. I would recommend to other parents for their chikldren. The price is fair also
2,"Strong fishy taste, NO strawberry.","I purchased these at GNC and tried one before giving it to my son. As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell the fish odor. I tried one anyway, and there was no strawberry taste that I could detect at all. Just an explosion of fish oil. Blech! Thankfully, GNC takes everything back w/in 30 days, even if opened. I returned them the next day and got GNC's chewable omega-3. Tastes MUCH better, like orange Starburst.In their defense, the NN Children's DHA supplements are very tiny. So if your child can swallow them whole, great."
5,Excellent Product - My kid loves these,This product is great and my kid loves the strawberry flavor. She ask to take her medicine. I strongly recommend this product.
1,Kids don't like taste,"My kids (6 and 9) hated the taste so I just took them myself. Got kids another brand, Lil Critters, which they like well enough to eat."
2,"Definitely no ""burst"" of STRAWBERRY flavor!","From the description these sounded much more like an actual chewable. These look just like a small, round vitamin E. I tested this before I tried coaxing my kids. I bit into it and it burst fish oil into my mouth! No, not the strongest fish oil ever, and yes there was some ""essence"" of strawberry there, but the chances of my kids attempting to chew these are NIL. I bought two bottles and I guess I will have to take them myself (and I WON'T be chewing them). I will go back to whatever brand it was I found at Target that was a chewable and I could get my 9- and 17-year old daughters to take them without a fight. Those were also less than half the price. Can't find them online, only in store."
2,Beware - NOT CHEWABLE,"Be careful - the Amazon description says they are chewable, but they definitely are not. They taste like fish with strawberry flavor and are not easy at all to chew. If you are looking for chewables, look for the gummies or fishies."
2,No way would my son chew these,"I purchased these at GNC and tried one before giving it to my son. As soon as I opened the bottle, I could smell the fish odor. I tried one anyway, and there was no strawberry taste that I could detect at all. Just an explosion of fish oil. Blech! Thankfully, GNC takes everything back w/in 30 days, even if opened. I returned them the next day and got GNC's chewable omega-3. Tastes MUCH better, like orange Starburst.In their defense, the NN Children's DHA supplements are very tiny. So if your child can swallow them whole, great."
5,Good for younger children,"I have been buying Nordic Naturals DHA supplements for myself and my kids for years. I used to get the Children's DHA for my daughter but, at 3.5, she wasn't just drinking it like she used to. Based on other reviews here, I figured the pills would go over well. She tried to swallow them whole like a grown-up but had some trouble. Chewing and swallowing, however, were not a problem. Now she reminds us to give them to her along with her other vitamins. No more battles to take her fish oil!"
4,I like it,"Nothing like a little fishy imagination are not, the baby was a little bit don't like the flavor of DHA, but rather than not fruit products better, thanks to this product."
2,Not well suited for young children,Our kids don't find this palatable. The casing for the softgel seems too hard and they don't like taking it.
4,"Good quality, good price","These are good quality dha fish oil capsules, we get it for our 6yo and she loves the taste. they are also small so they are easy to take."
2,180 Count is Misleading,"When I bought these, I was expecting them to last 180 days because it was a 180 count bottle of vitamins. When I received them, I read the nutrition label, which states a serving size as 4 pills! So really, this bottle will only last a month and a half, when I was expecting it to last much longer. I won't buy them again, because I think that is a bit of a rip off."
3,Great product except...,I have only one complaint about this product & it's the shell. It really is fairly chewy if your kids are looking to chew it. If it dissolved better this product would have my 5 stars.
3,its ok but.....,"i dont know, the idea of doing a string version of manson's greatest songs is a damn good idea. However, it was not pulled off as well as id hoped. when listening to these tracks, i always got the feeling that something was missing, while each song is tabbed to near perfection, the overall package still seemed kind of cheap.i dont know if its the musician's fault, bad or equipment or just simply done intentionally, alot of the string insturements give off a scratchy tone while leading which does not sound good.another complain is the choice of songs, some were great choices, but when leading mansons vocal parts, the melody becomes bland and makes you wish that that part was just taken out.overall, lots of effort was put into this and it is good, but just feels like much more could have been done"
3,Missing songs,I'm a little disappointed with the song choices. There are a couple of great songs that would have worked so much better. Maybe they'll eventually redo this album.
2,Too short,These things are barely taller than the comics they are meant to divide. I guess they are tall enough to let you almost read what you write on them so that is something.
5,I'm Not Divided On These At All,"As the other reviewers have already basically commented, these are simply pieces of plastic, and that is about it. However, its important to note that they are quite durable, have a smooth, clean texture, allow for pencil writing that can be erased with ease, and do just about everything a good comic divider does. Most importantly, I have to admit that they are slightly shorter than the majority of other comic dividers, but if you store your comics in file cabinets or similar storage containers like I do, the longer tabs will prevent you from closing the drawers, which makes these much more convenient and ideal. Also, for the price, you really can't beat them."
1,"Please, don't waste your money","Pit-i-ful! Simple as that, I also had a clerk tell me this stuff was great and that I should try it. I have a commercial cleaner (JFJ Disc Repair) but wanted to see if this little repair ""kit"" would work on lighter scratches and then I would not have to break out the big machine as much. What was I thinking?! This does NOTHING at all. I can not stress enough, do not purchase this even at the low price. It is a waste."
1,Don't buy this it will not fit your Toyota Sequoia,I tried and tried to install this but the product but it would not fit my Toyota Sequoia. The thickness of the material prevented the hood from closing. The hood is very close to the top of the headlights so when you try to install this it would not allow the hood to close. I had to return it. I gave it 1 star because it looks really nice when you take it out of the box.Paul
4,introverts never prosper,"These fellows of the Lincolnville are far too cultured and respectful of other's thoughts to convey how important it is to engorge their creative progeny. Yes, they could boastfully promise an answer to the eternal questions ""Why do we live? Why do we love?"" and would not be misrepresenting the content of ""You Know What You Are"", at least not semantically. Instead they deftfully underestimate the pan-emotional impact of their works and quietly beg for fate to intercede on their behalf. So wonderful is the spawn of their craft that college radio stations have been known to occasionally play them for weeks at a time! What argument could be more compelling?! Ok, rumour has it at least one of the mighty Tavares brothers is an admirer ... but you didn't hear that from me."
4,Think you can't meditate? Think again!,"I had tried meditation before and failed, because I was trying to learn the classical ""passive"" form of meditation, where you are supposed to empty your mind of all other thoughts and focus only on one thing. That simply did not work with my busy mind! In this easy-to-read book, Holly Sumner explains that ""active"" meditation, where you imagine and visualize whole scenes and events, can be just as effective. The only reason I gave the book 4 stars and not 5, was that some of her meditation scripts are kind of short & I had to add to them quite a bit to create a 15-minute taped session. However there are a few longer scripts here and there. Also, she doesn't provide much instruction on how to effectivly read & record (tape) the scripts for beginners. She talks about so many different ways to meditate, I think anyone could find a method that works for them. Overall, an excellent book!"
1,Pitiful At Best,"I bought this book for .25 cents at a yard sale. Boy did I waste my quarter!I found NO new meditation techniques in this little rag. It is clear to understand why the sales ranking of this book is only 608,394.This is your basic, ""You know the envision white light garbage and hold your breath to the count of ......"". You know the same junk that all charlatons teach. This book is pitiful at best."
3,Macx flies a litlle,"I have a lot of affection for this CD as it helped me get through a temporary separation from my good as ex wife and our children at the time it was released. Yes, it is a bit spotty, but the demand going by the second-hand prices doesn't reflect the couple of ratings given here so it seems that people are voting with their readies for the second-hand goods, thus reflecting Max's low score as a seller. I only know her from the record and a TV show appearance, but I think she had the brakes on here. The first two tracks are winners. I bought the CD because of the single, but the rest leaves me room temperature. Max's vocal stylings are unique. Let's see her go a bit further out next time in the style of Bulgarian vocalist extraordinaire Jildiz Ibrahimova."
5,A Thought-Provoking Analysis of American Race Relations,"This is a sensitively argued analysis of southern Jews at the height of the civil rights struggle. Webb strikes a fine balance in recognising the politically precarious position of southern Jews on the one hand, and the timidity that characterised their behaviour on the other. This is an impressive contribution not only to the literature on African American-Jewish relations, but to the understanding of American race relations in general."
5,A Strong and Important Contribution to the Literature,"Webb offers the reader a much more nuanced and well documented analysis than previous scholars. His chapter on gender is a particularly strong contribution. It is to date the definitive work on Black and Jewish relations! In fact, anyone interested in ethnic relations cannot afford to miss this."
3,'fight against fear',"A mixed effort - Webb repeats the conventional arguments and analysis of the behaviour of Southern Jews without adding much to them. A moderately good introduction to the subject, but not worth it at the price"
2,TOO BAD THE CASEY ANTHONY JURORS HAD NOT READ THIS BOOK BEFOREHAND,"Mr. Dershowitz: I wish the talking heads in the media had asked you to explain yourself when you fully endorsed this same old tired ""Abuse Excuse"" when Jose Baez used it and you SUPPORTED it in the Casey Anthony case. Having watched every minute of that trial, it was a textbook (according to YOU) use of the Abuse Excuse. Obviously the book was written well before and you felt the need for media exposure..no matter how you went about getting it!"
5,So true!,"Every single person who gets arrested or busted for a crime immediately uses the ""abuse-excuse"" it had to be their childhood or some other abuse situation. We have come to believe that every person has been abused, they must have been? or why would they rob a bank? steal? kill? become addicted to drugs or alcohol? Even if true, they were abused, what gives them the right to steal? to kill? to drive while drunk?Bad things happen to good people every day, does that give them the excuse to break the law? to hurt others? to live a criminal life?This book tells it like it is, we have become a society where we blame others for our own actions. We are responsible for what we do. good or bad, I guess we could all blame someone else, use the ""abuse-excuse"" but then what? We are a victim, so nothing after that is our responsibility?"
4,THE ABUSE EXCUSE,"The book offers a very interesting analysis on how abuse affects American socity and law; curiously, many people get use to be abused on a daily basis and never learned the tools to avoid it in every day life."
4,a good collection os songs from eyehategod,"this cd is a collection of songs from 7's, splits, and outtakes from the dopesick record. it has great songs that you probably never heard unless you have the 7's, like story of the eye, southern discomfort, and serving time in the middle of nowhere. and the other versions of the material from dopesick is great, like dopesick jam, depress, and peace thru war. eyehategod are one of the most overlooked band ever, this band had originality, in the time when speed was all that was improtant to metal eyehategod made the sludgiest music, since then bands have duplicated thier sound, but none have come close to being as good. i recomend dopesick or in the name of suffering before buying this one"
5,Love the cap!!!,"it was valentines day present from my wife. i couldn't find a brown NY cap anywhere but she found it for me here. i wear size 7 3/8 usually so if your size is similar get the XL. fits great, looks great, has nice little established in 1903 embroidered on the back. SWEET!!!"
5,Handel as we would wish!,"I bought this for Andreas Scholl (in a more perfect world he would be in more operas!) and of course he is wonderful. Inger Dam Jensen sings beautifully, looks beautiful, acts fabulously, and has amazing stage presence. I have always enjoyed Holge Danske, one of her earlier recordings. I loved Christopher Robson's funny, fearless performance. Other singers are also excellent. Oh, Andreas Scholl in the duet with the violin would be worth the price of admission without anything else, but musically it is all wonderful though the costumes are not all flattering, and I might wish for more ideas in the production. It is good but not fabulous."
2,A Lone Dissenter Amongst A Sea of Positive Reviews,"I ordered this book based on all the enthusiastic reviews I read from other everyday readers like me and I must say I was very disappointed by the writing style, especially since he's quite an established writer. Though the stories themselves are interesting enough, he writes as if this is a blog, with unfinished thoughts, meandering musings and distracting asides. It just made me wonder if an editor was ever involved in the process of getting this book published?!"
3,"Great for linguists, not so great for others","Make no mistake, this is exactly what the title says, it's a grammar. So those looking to try and pick up a little Kabardian will need to look elsewhere. However this is an excellent grammar of Kabardian for someone that either knows quite a bit of the language, or is a linguist."
5,Florida's first punks,"If you've enjoyed Florida's unique punk experience, you can thank these guys. Funny, melodic, interesting. Even when punkers here went hardcore or totally into noise, you could still feel the influence."
5,Very good CD !,This CD is very good. Voices of kids are great and music is very various and interesting. I like it !!
3,the electromagnetodynamics of fluids,"I think this is a very interesting book, I 'm a student and this is the first time, I read a book about this theme,but I consider that this book expain very well the inflence of the electromagnetic fields applied to the fluids and to the plasmas, and explain the relation of the Maxwell's equations to the kinematics of the fluids,and the Nevier-Stokes equations, nevertheless I think that for a new reader about this theme, must check first some others books about electromagnetics."
5,A masterful achievement !,"John A. Thompson, author of the Reformers and War: American Progressives Publicists and the First World War (1987)and a leading authority on the Progessive Era and First World War, has written a superb and compact biography of Woodrow Wilson, the best one-volume biography of Wilson that we have. Thompson's insightful account focuses on Wilson's leadership style and assesses both its strengths and weaknesses. As president of Princeton, governor of New Jersey, and president of the United States, Wilson exhibited both firmness and flexibility, and idealism and a practicality. Examining the abilities and the limits of political leadership in American democracy, Thompson carefully weighs the degree to which Wilson's successes and failures were a result of his own actions and a consequence of other factors beyond his control. This is a masterful achievement."
3,Limited,"This is not a full biog of WW. Its a look at his way of using power, mainly at Princeton and as Pres of the US. That leaves out quite a bit! There is very little in the book on how WW dealt with Congress, even during WWI (though more on this subject is here regarding the League of Nations.) There is VERY little about domestic concerns during WW's presidency, esp. with regard to race. Thompson is not only a bit too sympathetic toward his subject, but far too deferential to William Link's previous assessments of WW as well."
5,I loved it!!,"This was one of the first Silhouette Shadows I got ahold of, and it got me hooked! I loved the story. The charactors were well scripted. I don't want to give away too much to people who haven't read it, but air of mystery and delightful origins of the hero (Okay, his mother's the Fairy Queen!) were great.. (I love stuff like this!)"
1,Fake alert: Silverline DVD are not Surround,"Silverline has gotten a hold of several terrible live concert recordings, (and I mean the concert was bad and the recording quality of it is also bad, a double wammy) Silverline has repackaged them as DVD Audio Surround and is now selling them for an astronomical price in the hopes that an idiot like me would buy them, but I am returning this sucker. You won't be able to hear the surround effect because it was originally recorded in stereo, perhaps even mono. Do not buy them, you will be sorry. But if you do buy one don't hesitate to write a review here to warn others, just like I did. Silverline series is entitled ""From the Front Row"", BestBuy carries quite a few of them usually with a green cover. They try to entice you with famous names on the cover, great musicians who undoubtedly would not willingly allow these horrendous concerts to see the light of day if they could. You have been warned."
2,In the Company of Educated Women: A History of Women and Higher Education in America,I was not impressed with the amount of time it took to receive this book--especially from someone who has a high rating.
5,Another O'Brien Masterpiece,"Tim never ceases to amaze with his instrumental and vocal virtuosity and skill. A fan of his since his days with Hot Rize, I thought he had reached the summit of his career with Crossings. Was I wrong! Traveler is a delightful journey. I won't attempt to analyze this album from a technical standpoint -lets just say that if you are a Tim O'Brien fan, you'll love the trip that Tim takes you on. For example, Kelly Joe's Shoes makes you want to lace up you Chuck Taylor's and set off on your own adventure. As always, Tim delivers musical excellence and lyrics that touch your soul."
4,pat boones greatest hits,"I use this web to shop for items I can't find locally. I've got most of pat boone's songs except for the song ""louella"". Frankly I don't mind buying a cd as long as this song is there."
1,Steer Clear!,"Thought I was getting original hits, instead got a mixture of originals and 1990 re-recordings!! Speedy Gonzales, Almost Lost My Mind among the phonies. Too bad."
2,Very difficult to read,"I thought I'd be reading profound philosophical insights, but it's more of a religious cult kind of thing. I don't recommend it to anyone except hard core Eastern though people."
2,"Intriguing, but poorly organized.","This book had a lot of promise, written as it is by an English professor whose hands-on experience might easily translate to the experiences other do-it-yourselfers have. But it's disappointing. Concepts are poorly explained. There is little discussion about what pipe diameters (1/2"", 3/4"", etc.) are appropriate for what kind of job. He vaguely references working through moving from one diameter to the other, but does not explain why and in what circumstances each pipe is appropriate. Nor does he really put irrigation into a context that probably 90% of homeowners experience -- suburbia. There's discussion about micro sytems, macro systems, etc., but precious little discussion of the all-American suburban lawn. After reading this book, I have no idea what type of pipe and sprinkler is best for my suburban American lawn, and that's a pity indeed."
1,DO NOT RENT.,"This is, without question, the worst waste of two dollars ever. All this ""movie"" is is one guy, sitting at a desk in an alien Halloween mask, reading a script for the ENTIRE length of the video. I kid you not, that is the whole thing. Wow, what a waste of time and money. Well, you've been warned!!"
4,A good primer on upland birds,"Field & Stream has provided a decent book on the basics of upland bird hunting. If you have not hunted for the different species involved, you will appreciate the straight-forward nature of this book. While it is not as detailed or as illustrated as other books of similer nature, it does cover all the basic situations you can run into in the field. Well worth the time to read."
2,Great Book,"I'm brazilian, but i'm married to a an american citizen. I have the Brazilian Version of this book. I really liked it and I'm sure my husband did too."
2,What a disappointment,"Im also a big Trina fan also, but the sound quality is not very good at all. In the main menu of this DVD looks way off, its off to the right side. Slip N Slide Records needs to do a little job of making a better documentary of Trina. The scenes that I never seen were okay. Live Performances were okay, but everything else needs work. If youre not a big Trina fan or you are, its not worth your money and time. I was not impressed about this DVD.Bonus Materials - 2/5Live Performance - 2/5Sound Performance - 1/5Overall - 2/5"
3,(3.5 Stars) Trina brings it for her fans on 'Live and Uncut',"The Baddest Chick is back on the scene with a new release, only this time she bares all! Okay, this isn't a skin flick, but rather an up-close, in-your-face view of the life and times of Trina. Representing Slip-N-Slide to the fullest, the raunchy rapper gives her fans a behind-the-scenes look at not only her rap career in general, but also her videos as well as a live concert performance. It is actually three different concerts that are spliced together quite uniquely to say the least.She performs all of her hits as well as some verses from her guest spots on other artists' work. From ""Nann"" to ""B R Right"" to ""No Panties"" to ""Here We Go,"" Trina drops it like it's hot from one track to the next. Despite some of the amateurish video footage for her documentary, fans will still appreciate the offering on Live and Uncut."
5,Nicely made,"Bought these for my husband and they fit him so nice - slimmer look, looks like they were made for him."
2,Not well constructed,Not well constructedpoor cut on the pants - would not buy again - disappointed in the product - despite a favorable rating by others
2,expected better from carhartt,"the 2 pant really was a disappointment...the zippers would not stay up and after three washings , they start getting holes in them...i have had jackets , shirts , and coveralls from carhartt and was very satisfy...carhartt has always had a good rep...but now I don't know how to feel................"
2,Very Poor Quality,"I bought a pair of these jeans for my husband, and a hole wore in the material at the top of the back pocket. It became thread bare in that spot within 3 months of regular wear. Very disappointed because Carhartt is supposed to be a top name brand. Would not recommend these."
2,The first item I have ever sent back for refund,"I purchased a pair of these jeans a month ago and I loved them! I ordered two more pair of the same jeans in the same size. The jeans I recieved are no where near the size of the first pair. They were all marked 36X36 but the waist is smaller when I ordered the second time, I had to return them."
3,Different Definition of Relaxed Fit,"This is my first time ordering anything but T-shirts online and it may very will be the last. This is no fault of the seller. This is a beef with the product itself, I wear 38X36, 38X34 on a regular basis. So I ordered 38X36 relaxed fit, apparently their definition of relaxed fit is extremely different than mine. They are really tight in the waist area and normally the relaxed fit jeans I buy are looser there."
1,Too Small,I ordered 2 different Carhartt jeans. Men's Relaxed Fit Jeans & Men's Washed Demin Work Dungaree. I ordered the same size that I require in all my pants. The relax fit were too small.
5,Great jeans for the hubby,My husband hasnt tried them on just yet. They happen to be a Christmas present. Hope he likes them and fit.
3,carhartt jeans,we bought these assuming they had a cell phone pocket in the side like the ones we buy in our local store but they did not. so don't buy them if that's what you need.
5,great jeans,my husband loves these jeans. they are strong and durable. he has a several pairs. they fit well and they a very comfortable.
3,Cahartt Men's relaxed Jeans,I returned these because the siaze wasn't true. They tend to run smaller then the actual size. A bit overpriced too.
5,Great jeans!,"Jeans fit great, look great. True to sizing and don't shrink measurably. I really like the substantial material weight - will wear for a long time. Good stuff!"
3,not so relaxed,"These jeans are well constructed however not such a relaxed fit, I have to get into some tight spaces at work and need to be flexible Other jeans provide a more relaxed fit"
4,Very good item,A very good item and well worth the value. I have other jeans and nothing has compared to the wear and tear I put these thru. I will purchase another pair.
5,Couldn't ask for more,"They fit well, seem to wear well and definitely wash well. Price was also very reasonable. I couldn't ask for more."
5,Carhartt Jeans,"These jeans fit very well for me. They seem to be very well constructed.I will buy them again. Good price, quick shipping."
4,Good Jeans,"These are good quality, comfortable jeans. The only reason I didn't give them five stars is that the color is a lot ""bluer"" than in the picture. Mine were the darkstone but they were actually quite a bright blue color."
2,different fit,I find the pockets are set further on the side and smaller than I prefer for my wallet. It feels like the pockets are more on my hip than other carhartts I have worn. From now on I will buy my carhartts in a store. I would have returned them but I am on a jobsite and it is difficult to do from my location.Experience is what you get when you don't get what you want.
4,Not bad,"The jeans fit well, run slightly on the small size. They are double stitched and seem likely to last a while."
2,These pants have a cloying scent,"These pants fit well, but they have a very strong perfumey odor.I am very sensitive to smell, so I first soaked them for 3 days.The smell still persisted, so I have had them hanging outside for two days now.They still have a very strong smell.I am just going to leave them out until the smell dissipates.If it doesn't, I'll have to give them away.If it weren't for the smell, I would give these pants a 5."
4,well made,sturdy jeans with a comfortable fit and the extra belt loops are well placed. a good price doesn't hurt either. definitely something i would recommend and would buy again.
1,not good,the pants material is thinner than t he ones I purchased at Searsalso the sizing is different - too short
4,great jeans,my husband has a hard time getting jeans that he likes and fit well and are comfortable. these are just the ones that he says fit all his requirements for a good pair of jeans.
3,not as relaxed as some others,not as relaxed as some other relaxed fit in a 36... and a little pencil legged in the cuff ( I think the picture is accurate) I have not tried them with tall boots like cowboy boots but i suspect they won't fit well there but likely fine for work boots.Past that the material seems good and overall rugged pair of jeans - I'm happy with them but not to the moon about them
4,Not made for boots but they still worked out!,"Arrived on time and in good shape. If you're planning on wearing them with boots, order them one size longer than you normally would wear. I wear a 34 but a 36 wound up working with boots."
3,Color was darker than expected,Stone washed I thought would be a little lighter. These are very much a darker blue jean. But they are confortable.
2,Too much leg twist.,"I own several pairs of these in 33x36, and they are great. My favorites, in fact. But, as the title says, the legs twisted with the first washing. And I didn't even dry them on high, like I usually do. Also, the leg openings seem a little larger, and the fabric a little thinner than my others.Sending them back."
4,carpenter jeans,I like the jeans except for the front pockets... they are so narrow I can't get my hand into them.
4,Not bad for the price paid.,"While these jeans werent even close to their advertised length(I ordered a 28 length, it was closer to 32...), the quality was above the recent Wranglers I had gotten. Very heavy denim instills some confidence in their ability to last, and the colors are true to the pics here. I'll report back if they give me any trouble, but till then I will use and abuse them to the best of my ability(they are my work jeans)."
5,Gotta love Carhartts!,My husband loves these jeans. He is hard to please when it come to his jeans so that's a huge compliment.The fit is great!
2,A fly with a mind of its own,These carhart jeans are a good thick quality denim but the front zipper likes to drop down when least expected. No matter what I do the zipper will find a way to open when I am too busy to notice. I will never purchase this brand again because I hate flying low all the time.
2,Not a believer in Carhartt jean pants,"It drives me nuts that the zipper doesn't stay up. I think they are okay jeans but when wearing them I have a constant habit of checking my fly which is annoying because I am not sure if the zipper is down or not. I also don't like how these are tapered down to the ankle where the jeans won't fit over the tongue of my sneakers. I have Carhartt pants that are not jeans and they are amazing, so I thought these jeans were a fluke, so I bought a pair of Carhartt carpenter jeans and again I have an issue with the zipper. So I no longer will be buying Carhartt jeans."
2,Oh Boy,it works good as long as it is PLUGGED IN just like any other cooler! It does not run on it's own power as stated! You must be plugged in! I now have two that do exactly what I stated and I do not wish to discuss anything more. They still look high tech to everyone else. Oh Boy!
5,Great product,"I have owned this cooler for 2 years. Love the fact that it can be recharged and batteries last 3+ hours, letting me plug other thing in car while traveling."
1,"BORING , ARROGANT, AND WITHOUT SUBSTANCE","This book expressed the attitudes of a snobby, old-school grouse hunter. The stories seem to reflect fairy tale hunts, rather than anything a typical hunter experiences. Contrary to what the book seems to suggest, a ""good"" hunting dog need not be perfect, and not every hunt ends with a limit of grouse in the bag. Also, the book contains no useful information."
2,Interesting on Beading but it's NOT tatting,"This has some pretty and interesting stuff on beading but it's NOT tatting so don't think that you're getting tatting patterns. That is not the case. These patterns often use the look of a tatted piece (kindof) but it's made with beading (much bulker and not really lace like). The title is a little deceiving, and not being able to look through the book makes this big difference a little difficult to discern. It's certainly a fine book on beading but it's a whole world away from actual tatting."
1,paul mccartney - paul is live in concert,I bought this DVD not one but two times - I figured I musthave got a bad disc the first time. Two discs later (and trying both in two DVD players) I discover this is how horrible the DVD sounds!I would not have believed that a release of this extreme low standard of sound and visual would be marketed. It is difficult to listen to as the audio is up and down throughout.
1,VHS quality DVD,This dvd is like vhs quality. The director also switches from black/white to colored. This dvd is terrible.
4,Damn Marketing,"1) Mine is the Portuguese edition.2) Damn Marketing: As in almost everything released, the companys always leave something out, deliberately, so they can release later a ""new expanded special edition"".I do not know why they left out songs like Off The Ground, Another Day, My Love. They are beautiful songs, played on the tour, and shown on the TV Special.DVD`s should be an improvement in every sense on what VHS editions were lacking.What I have said, it applies mostly on Soundtracks, because they often leave out the songs that are the ones that people were looking for, or include different versions. Concert releases: you know they were performed, and simply not included, or poor editing, video and/ or audio. DVD`s, movies & music: not improving video/ audio, leaving out stuff, sometimes even more than the VHS editions, for instance the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, poor or no extras, well you get my point."
2,Hope his others are not as bad as this one.,"I bought this DVD, because I thought it would be great to see Paul McCartney live in concert.After watching the video, I feel like it may have been a good concert, but I will never know.That's because the video makers spent so much time playing around with editing features and other subjective bull.The final product really sucks.I was even more disappointed by the poor audio, which pumps in and out.This is unacceptable for a commercially produced product. I was so irritated I could not watch the whole video.Its the 21st century. I am sure that the video directors and producers have to know by now,what the viewer is interested in.This guy is a part of rock music history.If anyone is unsure of how it is done, take a look at the Eagles, Police, or a Michael Jackson concert video as an example.As a fan, I really wanted to get into this concert, but I couldn't stay with the video long enough, sorry Paul."
2,"nice concert, but...",...the audio is EXTREMELY compressed. Not at all what you expect from DVD technology.
3,Looking for Changes,"Yep. Looking for changes in the way Paul makes his concert videos! Ever since Paul left the Beatles in 1970, he's been giving us one great tour after another...and one bad concert film after another. First he gave us Rock Show, which was pretty darn good. Then, Get Back, which was a good effort. Next came this film, Paul is Live. Paul cuts to different performances (and sometimes different footage altogether) within the same song. Some of the footage is in color, some in black and white. Again, it cuts between the two within the same song. The music in this video is awesome. For the casual fan of McCartney, I recommend the ""Paul is Live"" CD. It features the same great music but without the bad video. If you're a die hard fan like I am, you'll probably enjoy this DVD."
3,"very good music, lukewarm directing and editing","The songs and the performances are strong, of course, but, as everyone else here notes, the direction and editing on the video seem lazy and misconceived. Paul is Live doesn't flirt with disaster like the Get Back dvd, but probably this dvd is best for those wanting a souvenir of a concert they attended. As a document in its own right, it's merely lukewarm.For a full concert dvd, the Back in the US dvd is the one to get first: the band is smokin hot and the video direction is a little snappier than you'll find on Paul is Live or (lord help you) Get Back. After Back in the US, the next concert disc to get is probably the Live at the Cavern dvd.The best solo McCartney dvds are probably the Wingspan and the In the World Tonight documentaries, though fans of Standing Stone will definitely get a charge out of that one too."
1,Could not get into it,"I have to disagree with everyone else. This book was not good, the writing was sloppy, disorganized, and just all around bad. I wanted to read this book because the plot appealed to me, a young man who comes from a bad home life, yet he chooses to turn his life around. Too many of our men, not just black men are abandoning their children to be raised by single mothers who have no choice but to become strong. I was highly disappointed. I could not make it through the book. Finally, i just skipped to the end and needless to say, the ending did not leave me wanting more. Maybe one day I will give it another try, but for now this book goes into my never again pile."
5,Traffic Jam !!!!!,"Was it possible??!! ..but, Ms. Williams has done it again!...After reading this book, I need to know WHAT she has for us to read next. Once more the author has ignited my reader's curiosity...I loved the way she wrote this story on the voice of the Black man and the unfair hand he is dealt in life. The female characters were well represented in every aspect from streetlife to the corporate world. His mother was unbelievable - she couldn't/wouldn't be mine!... This book brought tears, laughter, anger, hate...and had me screaming out loud! My heart broke with Nasir's father had his encounter. The levels of betrayal and lust are taboo. To have a mother love her son so deeply and selfishly, and then to later betray him to the utmost was scandalous!!!...and for what???!!!...and not even giving thought to her own grandchild???? Fellow readers - don't sleep on this one! This book is hot and HIGHLY recommended."
3,Being Taken For A Ride,"I read Ms Williams' other books, and thought they were pretty decent reads. Driven, however was on a whole nother level. I can not wait for the sequel to come out."
3,it was Ok!,"This book was just that, ok. I mean I did enjoy reading the book even though it was a little slow paced. This book is filled with so much unnecessary drama all circled around the main character Marv Bundy Jr who goes by Nasir. It is only two characters in this book who seems to have sense and thats Farren and Francine.But honestly I dont know why Farren is still wasting her time being with Nasir, she has to much going for her in her life to just settle with someone who is unstable and cheats.I felt cheated at the end of the book because there wasnt any closure, so i guess i have to read the sequel to get the rest of the story."
3,Don't want baby mamma drama then WRAP IT UP!,"Why are some men so stupid? Some of that drama could have been avoided if Nasir would have hit it and quit it with protection of course. But now he has a kid by a chick that he never even dated, is uneducated and just plain ghetto. Poor Farren, an innocent bystander has to deal with this mess. You know the saying ""what you won't do for love"". Now she's dealing with not only a crazy baby's mama, but also a stalker and a side piece who's just using Nasir to get back at his mother. And then there's his mother Loretta. What an idiot! There's no way I would have done 18 year hard time for no man. She never got to raise her kids and now they are out of control. Especially Nasir who only thinks with his smaller head until he met Farren. Hopefully Nasir will get it together in the sequal but it'll take a lot of change."
4,KASHAMBA U DID IT AGAIN!!!,Ms. Williams really outdid herself with this one and I can appreciate the change from the same storyline that some urban lit books have. We take a journey with Nasir but it begins with Marv& Loretta. He was a hustler and was set up with Loretta by her GRIMEY ass brother. When Marv finds out that he is going to be a father he decides to change the game and get out so he can be a father to his son and someone he can look up to. Marvs dream is short lived and Nasir and his sister are forced to grow up without a mother or father. Although Nasir doesnt make the best choices on his journey as far as the woman he has a child with he does his best to be the father that his dad never got to be and I would really encourage this book for any male in your life especially ages 16-35...trust and believe this one is worth it!!!
2,Not for the masses.,"I found this book to be a little to graffic to read to my children. My kids are coming to the age where they are ready for fairy tales, but I don't think that I want them to learn about such topics before they are drinking out of cups without lids on them. If James Finn Garner intended this book for children rather than a mens bathroom at a truck stop, then he intends to raise his children in a different manner than my wife and I. Some day my children will be ready to learn about sexuality and the humor behind it, but I think when that day comes they will be reading beyond the three little pigs and little red riding hood."
1,Not as good as it looks,This chair looks great. A friend of mine has one that is the same type of design but made from tubular aluminium and canvas that is so confortable that we fight over who gets to sit on it. I thought this chair would be a classy version with the same comfort so I bought 2. Boy was I wrong.The chair looks great but it is not comfortable at all. The end of the seat is too short or too long and your legs rest on the wood bar which is not at all comfortable. I'm not sure how it can be fixed (I think that the seating surface needs to be longer so that your weight rests on the seat and not the end bar) but it really is a design flaw.It also creaks very loudly when you sit on it.Definitely not worth the money as chairs but they do look nice on my deck! I now consider them purely ornamental.
1,Not worth it...,"We found deck chairs like this at a resort and we loved them. Bought this one because it was in our budget. This is held together by a nylon type string that broke in both chairs after only 1 1/2 summers outside (was stored inside during the winter). Was back at the same resort this spring and checked the chairs, they are held together by a wide strap which I imagine will hold up over the long run."
2,Poor Video quality,"This DVD has poor video quality, its a shame since the concert is fine and the songs are good selections."
1,A Big Dissapointment,"I have never been more dissapointed with CD like this one. Many if not all of these voices do not fit with the music. Thats a first no-no. The second thing is the style this music is played in. Elvis had a traditional style of music that was proportionate to the era it was being introduced. It should stay that way. Experiments like these should be left in the garage, I mean what's with the super heavy distortion on the guitar? It doesn't fit. Third, Lenny Kilmister, Michael Desbarres, and Jamie James voices do not justify Elviss'voice at all. They were I'm sorry to say ""horrible"". Let's respect what Bing Crosby thought was amazing voice. This album would have been better and a better use of Slim Jims' time without these three guys and the heavily distorted guitar. I definitely would not call this a tribute to the great Elvis Presley."
3,"WARNING--""The Devil Went Down to Georgia"" is not on this disk!","Please note--the 19th entry on the disk is ""Heavy"", by Kellie McGregor"", not the claymation piece based on the Charlie Daniels Band song. I bought this DVD expressly for this entry, based on the product information listed. The other shorts are fine, but I was disappointed...."
2,Sick humor...without the humor,"I like sick jokes and cartoons as much as the next guy. Why else would I buy a DVD like this? Unfortunately, the toons in this collection have no wit or point to them at all.Example:""Teach Me""- Cartoon frogs mate in unusual positions, one frog kills the other with a razor and a knife, surviving frog continues to mate with the dead frog, then he pleasures himself while staring at the sun and his eyes burst into flames, The End.I reiterate, I'm the kind of guy who considers American Psycho a comedy. These animations are not funny or insightful at all, just unpleasant to watch."
1,Amazon Messup,"The tracks on 1 - 18 were correctly listed, but track 19 was WRONG... it is NOT Devil Went Down to Georgia.... fortunately I did return it and recieve credit, but it was meant to be a gift which I ended up not getting to someone on time"
3,If you like this you'll also like...,"Hi I have been a big fan of animation my whole life.I went to College very close to Cal Arts and so I knew many animators. While this DVD does contain many great films you should also check out this guys site http://www.nickgibbons.com. This is a friend of mine who just released his animation DVD. It is very funny, but he has no way of getting the word out. Check out his site and trust me, it's worth the price. He has a short on this Spike and Mike DVD, but he told me he doesn't see a dime anything they sell. Check out his site and please help support independent film making."
5,Holy Dio ROCKS!,"This tribute album is simply amazing. All of the bands on this album are so good and so telented that sometimes it's hard to tell wether it is Ronnie James Dio or someone else. Hammerfall and Gamma Ray do an amazing job on ""Man On the Silver Mountain"" and ""Long Live Rock 'N' Roll."" This Disc is almost an anthology of Ronnie James Dio's greatest hits. It has songs from his early days in Rainbow, songs from when Dio was in Black Sabbath. And a few songs from when Ronnie went solo with his band Dio. This is one of the best tribute albums I have ever heard. It has an awesome mixture of Heavy Metal, and acoustic guitar throughout the Cd. You will surely get your moneys worth out of this Cd."
3,Faithful Folios Review of Secrets,Vertical Reach = 3Jessica is searching but others in the book have a good representation of their relationship with God.Ministry Message = 3People seeking peace can find it in the Lord and possibly love as well.Craft = 4Robin Gunn Jones writes the romance formula well.Aesthetics = 3Cover is nice and appropriate but not eye catching.Dollar$ and $ense = 3.5
3,Just okay,"I love Jones Gunn's Sisterchicks series and was anticipating the arrival of Secrets. I have to admit I was disappointed. It was a quick and easy read, but predictable and not compelling. I like a light-hearted fiction book that doesn't require a lot of thinking now and again. It wasn't painful to read, just forgettable."
5,Secrets by Robin Jones Gunn,"Jessica Morgan tries to sneak into the sleepy town of Glenbrooke under the radar.But as fate would have it Jessica has an accident and is rescued by a local favoritefirefighter, Kyle. Jessica was employed by the principal of the high school before she got to town. But the only man who knows her secret has had a stroke and is unable to welcome her to her new job. She has no money, no car and no one to trust.Kyle and her new friend Teri want her to turn to God and to learn to trust them are confused by her unwillingness to share her life with them. Will Jessica learn to turn things over to God and trust the friends that want to help?I had a hard time putting this book down. I really wanted to learn Jessica's secret.I am also very anxious to read the next book in this great new Christian series.I give this a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars."
3,Secrets,"It is evident that Robin Jones Gunn is use to writing for adolescents. This book is a small step up toward storytelling for adults. For the first half of the story mysterious innuendoes are substituted for intrigue, it lacks believability and the characters are ill-defined and inconsistent. Then, it seems that Robin's gift for bringing the reader into the world of the characters begins to surface and her ability to bring her characters to life emerges. Before book's end, I was ready to read the second in the series. I was and am a huge Robin Jones Gunn fan."
5,A favourite book,I have a 1995 version of this book when it was probably first published and I love it. I read it when I was just out of high school and still remember the book now. Robin Jones Gunn is a fabulous writer. HEr books are easy to read and keep you wanting more.
5,Excellent!!,"I have read many of Robin's books and I think that this along with the other books that follow it are the best that I have ever read! I am a librarian and I get to read a lot of great books, but Robin is the best author I have ever read. She has a way of making you look at things through God's eyes when otherwise you couldn't see it that way. I think she is very blessed and we as readers are blessed to have a wonderful author such as she. I can't wait to read her other books. I have recommended this series to many of our Library patrons and I try to make sure we have as many of her books as possible in our collection."
5,Secrets,"Secrets was an excellent book. The characters are like real people. It is like this whole story comes to life right before your eyes. I could not put this book down. Robin knows just how to write the right thing at the right time. I was on the edge of me seat throgh the whole book. Also, it makes you think about your life and your walk with Christ. I loved this book."
5,Awesome series!,"Robin Jones Gunn is such a talented writer! She takes you to places you've dreamed of going and after reading you feel like you have been there. Every chacter experiences feelings that almost every woman can relate to. She is my favorite christian fiction writer. I hope she continues writing. I love the whole Glenbrooke Series. The series takes you to Hawaii, TN, CA, OR, WA....but each one is linked to Glenbrooke...a town you kind of wish you could visit or even live there...of course its seems like you do when you are reading the series. I just finished book 7 of the 8. I almost hate to finish the last one....I want there to be a number 9 and continue on. The Glenbrooke series has romance and friendships that intertwine in each book. Gardinias for Breakfast is awesome too as well as the Sisterchicks books."
5,RECOMMENDED HIGHLY,"I heard another lady talking about this series of books in my local Christian bookstore. I decided to try them and bought the first three books. I couldn't get anything else done for reading these books. I purchased the rest of them online. The stories are wonderful, believable, and thoroughly enjoyable. I hope the author will write some more in this series or something new soon."
5,Great Christian Fiction Read,Secrets is a really great read. Usually I dont read this type of fiction but sure am glad I had the opportunity to read this. Its a story of secrets hidden then revealed and of forgiveness. It involves a small town and a woman on the run. This book had me from page one and I am sure it will grab hold of you too! Highly recommended..
3,Enjoyable but not great!,"I know this book has a lot of fans here but honestly, I thought it dragged in parts and was very unrealistic. Jessica's so-called ""secret"" was just ridiculous. Here I thought she was in fear for her life but nope, nothing of the kind ... I liked this enough but its definitely not a keeper for me. I plan to check the others in the series out at the library! P.S. Jessica seemed very superficial at times, even thinking in depth how BIG her best friend Teri's legs looked in white pants. Huh?!"
4,mush,this really comes in handy having an exctra one. i was a little dissapointed that a spare scraper did not come with it.
2,Cuisinart Stainless Steel Chopping/mixing blade,Product arrived on time and in good condition.Disappointed as the blade dulled much quicker then the blade that originally came with the machine.Wouldnt order it again.Not worth the money.
5,5 Stars aren't enough,"The Shangrilas recorded some absolutely unforgettable music and this is the collection to have, whether you're a newbie or a diehard. The Ultimate in teen angst. All the hits and more. The radio bits are a hoot"
2,Hmmm,"No, its not cool. Its a quick attempt from ESPN to make some money. Any one of us could have put a better CD together."
5,What a Rocker!,"Holy Molly this C.D ROCKS THIS WORLD! This is one of the best cds that I have ever heard! I think just by listening to a few of the songs, No. 1 and 2 are the best so far."
4,Left Wanting 1 Thing...,"...where's 'Welcome To The Jungle' by Guns 'n' Roses, the song that gets every hockey fan in every arena pumped? That's disappointing.However, Track 2 makes me think of home: the good old National Hockey Center in St. Cloud."
3,It's just ok,It is just ok. It doesn't contain most of the really good fan pleasing cheers. I'v heard others that were better.
4,Stadium Anthem collection,"""Stadium Anthems"" does a nice job of covering many of the songs that you hear at various sporting venues. Some good ones here and some that are just so-so. But all in all, a good purchase if you want to relive some of those moments when ""you were there!"""
3,FAIR TO MIDDLIN',"The standard sport stadium tunes are here, about a third of the tracks. The other tunes are more personal taste. It helps the producers used the original artists and not some cheap make-overs. Not a bad buy. Okay if the price is right."
2,Not very complete,"I teach an intro graphics course. I found that this text didn't cover the full set of things that are usually found in such a course (or covered them too superficially.) I do find its OpenGL examples embedded directly into the text to be useful for my students, but for me that doesn't forgive the lack of sufficient explanation of topics I care about.I should note that I'm not aware of a 5 star text either. Although Foley-vanDam-et.al. is sufficiently complete its a little hard for some undergrads. I haven't yet checked out Angel or Watt or Shirley but they seem popular alternatives."
3,Good but not as good,"First off this book is in full colour, which gives a lot of people a nice image of this book. The layout of this book is good though the topics are not arranged quite well. This book is not as good as the second edition in the topic arrangements. It jumps from teaching 2d to 3d and revert back to 2d........... so on.Very good explanation given on every single topic except for advanced topic eg. ""ray tracing"". I highly recommend you to get the 2nd edition before you get this edition.PS : this book have no cd accompanying it...........so codes must be written out yourself thats another cons."
2,The code is easier to comprehend,The author can not express himself fluidly. The text does not follow an easy procedural methodology. You end up just looking at the code and understanding whats going on from that. It covers a lot but at the end of the day it's not a good text... The math isn't hard as long as you've had Linear Algebra.
5,Powerful concept,The Sex Contract does a great job of developing a novel concept for the development of human intelligence via pair bonding and mutual assistance. It examins cooperative development as a competitive stratigy in early hominids. It builds a compelling argument for the strong development of social stratigy in the success of the species.Well written with a broad appeal for serious behaviorial scientists as well as sutdents of the human condition.
5,Formally an excellent structural steel book.,"I used the 3rd edition while in engineer school and found it to be an excellent book. It made learning the subject easy and interesting. The text book explainations are written clearly and the examples are very helpful. It was also a great reference book.I was checking to see if there was a recent edition that covers the newer structural design methods but, unfortunately, the book is no longer updated and appears to be completly out of print. I imagine this text book now is mostly obsolescent."
5,The Ideal Chinese Political Leader,"This is a great book that provides a in-depth analysis on Chinese political thought and Chinese ideal personality as well. I highly recommend to those who are interested in Chinese culture, history, and philosophy."
5,"A Gospel Must-Have who loves Jazz, R&B, and Neo-Soul","This is highly recommended for gospel or neo-soul lovers alike who loves the sound of Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Angie Stone, Alicia Keys, The Roots, Common, etc. Especially I've seen 'em at our church in Norcross where they did sound good performing @ a gospel conference. I wish Joye B Moore the best luck of their career and look forward of hearing from them one day."
2,Ok,"My daughter's doctor said she needed to be on a multivitamin so I went to CVS and this was the only one they had. My daughter hates it. I tried a taste of it to see what it taste like and found out why she hates it so much. It looks like iodine and taste like vomit. I was hoping to find something else on the internet that she might like better, but so far there isn't much to choose from."
1,only way to get his Dust Mix,"I had to hear Time's Up (Dust Mix) from a P to P download (unfortunately @ 128kb) and got fixated on it's trippy groove. I can't really stand any Moby stuff, but this one had me hooked and I had to have it.I'll leave the rest to Moby fans."
2,A weak shot,"On this cd Sheriff attempts to mimic American band Styx, and some stuff that sounds like Starcastle ( the Yes take off band in the late 70's)...the big song is here (""When I'm With You"")And it is a goodie..., there is one other great stand out track ""Living For A Dream"", which shows the band had some range and ideas, but mostly this is just a weak shot of what they had.. realizing I am not a big Sheriff fan... just like that big song... That song will no doubt appear on a compilation somewhere... but you won't get the other tune I speak of... so grab this one on the cheap just for that reason..."
4,Good Album,"This is a good album! One of the song is just stupid, Kep Me Coming, what the hell dose that mean? That is one of the stupidest songs I have ever heard! But the rest of the songs are really good."
4,The Eighties' Greatest Comeback/Feel-Good Story?,"Frozen Ghost's Arnold Lanni and Wolf Hassel were one half of Sheriff, whose 1983 song ""When I'm with You"" recharted and hit #1 six years later. The other half of the band was vocalist Freddy Curci and guitarist Steve DeMarchi, who were both out of the music business when ""When I'm with You"" began receiving airplay in 1989. Curci, who was working for a courier service at the time, tells this story: ""Imagine delivering a package to an office and hearing yourself on the radio. I'd be signing a shipping slip and smiling, and the girl at the front desk would ask what I was laughing about. I'd say, `That's me singing on the radio.' And she'd say, `Sure, buddy, now on your way'"" [Music Express #150; 41]. After ""When I'm with You"" topped the charts, Curci and DeMarchi joined forces with original Heart members Michael De Rosier, Steve Fossen, and Roger Fisher to form Alias, which had a #2 hit in 1990 with ""More Than Words Can Say."""
4,"""When I'm With You"" such an awesome song","I bought this because I wanted to get When I'm With You and I was glad I did, cause I now like some other songs on this disk. This album has some similarities to Freddy Curci and Steve DeMarchi's second band, Alias. I only rated this a 4-star because it didn't have much linear notes."
5,"THE VOCALS, THE VOCALS, THE VOCALS","This band came and went. The tunes are great, pop/rock that are not cheesy, but provide strong hookage! I am giving this album a 5 star because this vocalist kicks ass! As a rock voice coach, I can tell you, this guy ranks up there with Tate, LeBrie, Perry, Halford, etc...Strong tenor with ENOURMOUS range, you have NEVER heard anyone sing this high before, trust me! Genius work by the singer....who ever he is....buy it...."
5,One of the best Albums this year,"This album will blow you away! 10 superb catchy, melodic songs, with great sound, great instruments and a great voice. forget c&c. These guys know how to make (good) music. NO chance of stuffiness. One of my favourite albums of this year so far."
1,"Negative, irritable and often outright hostile.","Overall, I did not like this book. The author, Howard Hayden, appears to have a chip on his shoulder brought on by his apparent perception that liberalism is too closely associated with the perceived promise of solar energy. He takes a one-sided Rush Limbaugh-like approach in his analysis of this important topic.....except, Hayden's facts are now outdated. For example, he apparently did not forsee the very recent development of the high efficiency 225W 3x5 solar panels by Sharp Inc. Within just years, for example, his fixation on the land area of Connecticut could now be reduced significantly. He also apparently does not understand the principles of ""economies of scale"". Somebody in 1880 could have just as easily written a book about the fraud of electical power. Such a person would have never made any meaningful contribution to this world and would have died writing beside his lantern, while the rest of the world had electric light. [...]"
1,Not a serious book on the subject,"As an electrical engineer I am surprised that that solar and wind energy are even questioned at all in this book. Solar and wind energy have the capability of powering the US only if these type installations are made a priority by utilities and government. The costs per KWh have dropped dramatically and for wind are already below coal and oil (specially when considering the costs of pollution and cleaning up spills, not even considering the costs of supporting supply lines from the middle east) at less than 5 cents. None of this is discussed. In any case I agree with previous reviewers this is not a serious book on the subject."
2,Solar Energy and the Future of Mankind,"Mounting evidence suggests that the author's conclusions are valid for a limited time. Solar energy (solar, wind, hydro,& biomass) may never be able to provide all of the energy required for survival of 6 billion people(earth's current population).However, solar energy may have to provide most of mankind's energy in the future. If terrorists make atomic energy too dangerous, if fission energy remains a dream, and if fossil fuels become depleted, then mankind will be forced to obtain most of its energy from renewable energy sources.Current estimates suggest that mankind has about 33 cubic miles of recoverable crude oil remaining and that we are consuming about one cubic mile each year.Perhaps the sequal to this book will be, ""How to Survive on Solar Energy in the Post-Petroleum Era""."
2,Very disappointing Special Director's Edition,"I decided to purchase this expensive 2 disc Amazon DVD-R release because of the Special Director's Edition label.Imagine my disappointment when I found it had exactly the same content as the standard single disc City Lights release that I already owned.If you are interested in this powerful film and do not already own the original USA release, this will probably be worth getting. The DVD-R transfer and general presentation is very good throughout.Unfortunately, in my case, it was a total waste of money."
5,The Best Morally Disturbing Film I Have Ever Seen,"Being a fan of Gillian Jacobs from her role on Community, I wanted to see some of her other characters and see her in a dramatic role. However, I was not really prepared for a movie of this type. As other people have stated it was so hard to watch yet you had to finish the movie. I almost need to go to therapy just after watching it. This is a movie that I will definitely recommend to others."
4,Gardens of the Night - A Review,"The movie was well done, although disturbing. Ryan Simpkins, Gillian Jacobs, Jermaine Scooter Smith, Kevin Zegers, and Tom Arnold were excellent in their various roles. This is one of those films I believe every parent and therapist should see with time set aside after watching for returning to normal. The first half of the movie surpassed the second half, although terrifying for any parent of young children due to the content. The movie is one of those that comes along every so often that can easily twist and wrench one's heart as one sees the abhorrent result of child abduction and defilement. The director's comments do help in clarifying some aspects of the film."
2,"Disappointing ""Night""","Saw this film recently on Showtime and it was based on the fact that John Malkovich was in it but unfortunately it is primarily a cameo of about 10 minutes of screen time. The kidnapping of a little girl from her San Diego home was harrowing to say the least and the acting from Tom Arnold as the abductor and Jeremy Sisto, Harold Perrineau as his confederates was also very good but the film just dragged on to its dismal conclusion. I often wonder what the filmmakers intent was to have such an un resolved ending? I was hoping that the female, now a teenager would slowly be indoctrinated back into her family. What's also missing from this disappointing film is that we are not shown what the abductors did when she reached the teen age or how she was dumped back into society. So basically the blame is on the writer and director of this film rather than the actors the actress playing grown teenage girl lacks a center in her acting."
2,The pill goes down if the cat is upside down? Oh no!,"On the positive side, I found that the author's love of the breed was apparent in her warm comments, and I think potential or new owners of Siamese cats would find some helpful information here. However, since this book was published in 1989, some of the information is dated, such as the statement that none of the commercial cat foods should be fed exclusively because none are complete diets. I was alarmed by the technique used for getting a cat to swallow a pill - by holding the cat upside down! Don't buy this book. There are a number of current books available on owning or, more accurately, being owned by a Siamese cat! I recommend ""Guide to Owning a Siamese Cat"" by Brenda Yule (1997); ""The Complete Siamese"" by Sally Franklin (1995); and ""Siamese Cats, Everything about Acquisition, Care, Nutrition, Behavior, Health Care, and Breeding"" by Marjorie McCann Collier (1992)."
4,GREAT ENERGY,This product is great to gain energy for whatever you need to do. Instant pick me up when I need to get things done.
5,Excellent and erudite,This book is a treasure of neoclassicism in Sweden. It is supported by sensible (not gushy interior design talk) text and is logically sequenced.The pictures and additional material is excellent; although the lighting in some of the photographs is less than perfect.This is an inspirational reference for the topic.
4,Good Products - except the soap,The facial scrub is great - but the soap dries out skin to point of irritation. I recommend using that soap sparingly...but the scrub is really great. And the lotion is awesome!
3,Good Black Metal,"Good Black Metal album, very brutal and intense. This was my first Behemoth CD so i was looking forward to finally listening to it. Good recommandation for black metal lovers."
2,As Bland as Deicide,"Behomth attempted to pick up the ball dropped by Mayhem, but they just can't shock people any more. Whereas early Mayhem made you want to pick up the guitar and start playing, this is pretty generic black metal. I got this because I heard they were one of the only Thelemic bands. None of the songs stand out and even when ripped on a hard drive the vocals are still unintelligable. Skip this and throw away the geek black metal clothes because black metal is dead and no music sells any more. It's pretty much a third world country and this album only reassures that. I'm not taking trash, but come on, this is worse than Mayhem and as bland as Deicide."
5,Behemoth-Satanica,"Wow...What can I say? Being a big black metal fan, I listened to this C.D. at a local record store (Root Cellar Records). I was blown away when I first heard it and it just keeps getting beter with every listen. Skirting the boundaries between black and death metal, this is one of the most impressive C.D.'s to come out recently(although it is two years old). From the opening track Decade of Oepion all the way to the end, you will not be disappointed. A definite 5 of 5. Add this one to your collection if you find it. You will not regret it."
1,Not what was advertised....,"The book was advertised as being a used library book with a few library markings, CLEAN cover and pages through out. What I received was NOT a library book (had no markings) BUT was written in all over inside cover and first three pages and then written in THROUGH OUT the WHOLE book, including on pages containing Blakes drawings.Not at all what was promised..."
5,still gets play on my CD player,"This band came and went very quickly but they were obviously very talented. It doesnt hurt that the studio production is rather good -- clean and layered. The lyrics are sometimes cute but there is always a smart, wry tone running underneath. One gets the sense the band made these tracks as a lark while undergrads at Yale. Seems like making pop music was not their main ambition in life."
2,fine product,I really didn't need it.. feeding rice cereal through a bottle was more of a pain. I just started the feeding process instead. product was fine.
2,NEVER!!!,I ONLY WANT BOOKS! VIDOES WILL SPOIL MANDIE. I ADORE HER. LOIS NEVER LET A VIDEO BE MADE!!!!
1,Can't rate as I do not have the book,"It has been a month since I purchased this product and as of June 16th, I have not received this book. Is there anyway that I can find out when to expect delivery?"
2,Didn't fit,"Looks like the right hose, but it is not tapped for 2 lines on the truck side. If your truck has 2 lines connecting to the hose on the truck side don';t get this one get H620184."
2,NOT FOR BEGINNERS,THE VIDEO IS NOT GEARED FORE BEGINNERS. NOT ENOUGH PRACTICE TIME FOR THE SIGNS AND REPEATING OF SIGNS.
2,On the Dark Side,"I bought this ""tribute"" with great expectations, but ended up quite disappointed. The violin sounds after a while gets too domineering, monotonous and has the effect jarring my nerves. I've never been a great fan of ""tributes"", this production makes me even more skeptical."
4,Great Whitney Houston Karaoke CD,"The Pro Artist: Whitney Houston karaoke CD is great fun! I'm a Whitney Houston fan, love her songs, and I'm tone deaf. My friends and I have big fun singing these 15 Whitney Houston songs on Karaoke Night at my house. The instrumental music is not like the actual CD version of the songs but it's close enough. There are a few songs that I'm not as familiar with so it would have been helpful to have the original songs and the karaoke versions on the CD. However, I just go to my Whitney Houston CD collection and reacquaint myself with the songs. Although, the time gap between each song and the intros at the start of several songs are a bit long for me, it's still a great karaoke CD! The price of the Pro Artist: Whitney Houston karaoke CD was reasonable, especially for a graphics type karaoke CD. Fifteen Whitney Houston songs on a karaoke CD makes for great fun and a wonderful way to remember Whitney, who left us too soon - RIP Whitney."
4,Almost perfect,"A hearing problem with the pitch usually used by alarm watches hampers my use of one, so I bought this one. The alarm is a fine reminder through the day of recurring ""markers"" that I need, but the vibration is too faint to waken me as an alarm. Ah, well, nothing is perfect, but this one is very very good."
4,better the second time round,We had to return our first watch because of faulty batteries and alarm. This one seems to be working with no problems.
2,Vibrating alarm Timex,The watch served it's purpose until the alarm stem fell out two weeks after putting into service.The vibrations are not very bold so it probably wouldn't wake you up.
2,DISTORTED - SEE THE ALTERNATE VERSION,"Readers of ROSS AND TOM should read Ross Lockridge, Jr.'s son Larry Lockridge's version of his father's mental illness that led to his suicide. That's called SHADE OF THE RAINTREE and is both a compelling biography as well as an insightful review of what we knew about depression in the 1940s and what we know about it today. I've read both of these books, as well as RAINTREE COUNTY, which for me is a great American novel whose day will return. I find Legget's version of this wondrous author as distorted as a funhouse mirror."
1,I can't review a product I can't download and read!,"Although this product is listed a directly downloadable from Amazon, there is no obvious way to download it. Adding it to the shopping cart just gets the error message to return to the product page to download the file. 'Round and 'round we go... Thanks, Amazon."
3,Not Impressed!,Doesn't seem to be complete. Missing programs. Some are trail versions. Just was not satisfied.
5,Awesome Motivational CD,"Earl is a great motivational speaker. His examples are real world and hit home. I have other motivational CD's as I like to cycle them in/out, but this set is one of my favorites! I highly recommend adding these to your collection, or if buying your first one. These are great for listening on the commute to and from work. They really motivate you to change your attitude on life and put in a plan of action to change what you don't like."
5,"Great Man, Great Voice, Great Advice--Timeless and Time-tested Wisdom","Great Man, Great Voice, Great Advice--Timeless and Time-tested Wisdom.His points of views affected many personal development gurus, and still very sound and insightful.One of the best grand-daddy CDs on personal development!"
5,Age old Wisodm - Heard anew each time I listen.....,"THis is one of the most power filled words written! I can listen again and again and still hear something new!Earl Nightengale is a winner! THIS CD set is worth every penny invested!!!As a life architect at Amazing Life Design, this is such valuable resources for myself and my clients!"
5,Se han publicado bastantes libros,"sobre las diferencias emocionales entre la pareja..PERO JAMÁS UNO COMO ESTE, QUE SE AVOCA DE FRENTE A LA INTELIGENCIA EMOCIONAL para resolver esas diferencias y zanjar problemas"
2,The engineers ruin the musicians' hard work,"I love Jaco's bass playing, and have listened to it mostly through Weather Report, that's why I bought this. All music here is great, they have even managed to back up Jaco's playing from beyond bass-heaven, but the sound engineering is pretty bad. There are a lot of odd noises here and there that really drag me out of the zone where I try to enjoy the hard work the musicians have put into the making of this (musically) great tribute to Jaco. I wish I the engineer will be casted on the Apprentice, so I can see him get FIRED!"
4,Continuim: Main highlight of Tribute cd,"Very Good tribute cd to the greatest jazz bassist of all time. Only gripe is that Portrait of Tracy was left off. Otherwise, excellent."
4,Good Bass Playing,I liked the Bass Playing but I thought the band did not really swing that hard. But nice to hear Jaco's Music. A true innovator and nice to hear it no matter who plays it. But the band sort of sounded like good reader's but not confortable with the tunes. The Bass Playing is top notch. This cd could have been a 5 star with a couple of more rehearsals.
4,Gives new life to old masterpieces,"It dosn't matter if this is your first exposure to Jaco's music, or you're hundredth time listening to these songs, anyone will be able to enjoy these classics. The standout track is Jimmy Haslip's take on ""Continuum"" which is almost as beautiful as Jaco's version. ""Teen Town"" sounds good bass-wise, but the horns are a little ""thin"" sounding. There are even a few funky tracks, like ""Wiggle Waggle""(which is the only song that features Jaco's playing). This is a good album, but my only complaint is that the talented bass players like Christian McBride and Jimmy Haslip try too hard to sound like Jaco. Victor Wooten is basically the only player that throws some of his origional flair into his covered song."
3,Pretty good in spots,this is a cool idea to give a tribute one of the Baddest Cats to rip on a Bass Ever Jaco Pastorius.the Arrangements are nice&you get a different voicing with the various Bass players Esembled here.it has a cool mellow vibe that works in spots.I think Jaco had such a Large Pressence on His Instrument&Voicing of it that it's hard to duplicate what He was putting down.but this set has some nice textures.it's interesting.
2,Okay For Beginners,"There are definitely better techno mixes on the market than this one. You would be better off getting a good Paul Van Dyk or Daft Punk CD. Most of the songs on this offering are badly mixed and repetitively simple. Even the songs from good artists like Dj Keoki and Moby don't represent even thier decent work. I gave this 2 stars because it contains maybe 2 songs that I enjoy. (James Brown, and Chzek This Out)"
2,A little slow for techno,Techno has better mixes of sound. The cd kinda of sounds like a beginner made this one.
4,I like this toaster . .,The Toastee TT321 looks great in my pantry. I like the digital countdown and bagel button. My english muffin comes out perfect every morning! Very happy with this toaster and would recommend it to anyone who is looling for a 2 slicer in stainless steel.
2,I was expecting better,"The timer function is cool - it's nice to know how long before your toast is going to pop up. Unfortunately, for the unit that I received anyway, no matter how you set the dial (warm to burnt), the toast comes out the same. If you want lightly toasted bread, forget it unless you hit the cancel button. Other than that, it's a nice unit. I gave it away to someone who liked their toast consistently dark."
3,It's a keychain.,"Having bought a Frontier int he last year, and having a few friends who also have Frontiers, I figured this would be a cool little self-gift for myself and a thoughtful gesture towards them from me. So I bought a few, mainly with those intentions. I'm glad I did. The key-chain is simple yet functional and the only real drawback I see is the leather connector between the emblem and the key ring. I question how long it'll hold up. That aside, though, it worked like gangbusters as a token of friendship. They loved it. It's one of those ""sense of ownership"" things, I guess. Bottom line is, for less than a buck, this product pays dividends when used properly."
3,color blind?,i ordered white and they sent me gray!!! are they color blind or just dont know how to read order..so next time if you wanna order gray just tell them you want white! i dont have time to return this item so i just have to deal with it..but i am really disappointed!!!!!
3,Get the movie you really want to see instead....,"I was browsing Amazon for the Spinal Tap dvd ,when I came across this 3 DVD pack.It seemed like a good buy since I had seen Airheads and I liked the movie.I wonder why/how Bill and Ted's excellent adventure fits into this compilation.While Spinal tap and AIrheads qualify to be called rock n' roll flicks,B&T is an extremely kiddish flick ( looks dated in 2008 )and apart from a few stray refernces to their band and some rock star names thrown in,is no way a rock flick.I could think of so many other flicks which would have rounded off this compilation better.Am not sure if they belonged to the MGM catalogue,but even then,Im sure the MGM guys would have found something more relevant to this theme if they looked up their library.I'd recommend that you buy the DVD of the movie you want,rather than invest in this pack."
2,"A very dubious and ""edited"" time capsule","""Box 21"" is an interesting package, but not something I'm likely to ever go through again. It's interesting only the first time 'round.The people left in charge of Warhol's world are trying so hard to make money from it. They are sure to be selling each and every ""time capsule"" he kept. It's a way to keep themselves going and what he would have wanted.The people in charge of Warhol are not to be trusted. I suggest anyone wanting to really learn about him not buy anything from the Warhol institute, foundation, museum, whatever guise his money is still feeding them.Believe me, if this book had been good, I'd be praising it. Don't waste your money. Although Warhol would've liked it if you had."
4,Must have items for Lefse making!,"I haven't used the Lefse mix that came with this kit, but all of the other products work great and are must-have items for Lefse cooks! These products (including the grills) are difficult to find in stores, so I'm glad they are available on the web."
1,Worst I have ever owned,"I bought one of these last year and it lasted maybe a month. It tears, rips to the point where its non usable as well as an eye sore. Trust me, don't waste your money on these overpriced, horrible recliners."
2,Not well balanced,"Nice thick padding just as advertised, but not really well balanced (always feel like you're about to tip over). Took a long time to get here and was about fifty dollars more than Costco online. Should have done my homework!"
5,Review,"Heard Bomb Bomb Iran when it first came out, I suspect this is a different version, & when I stumbled upon the album had to have it. Vince seems to have a never going to die attitude & appears to be a Patriotic American. Also love Bomb Iraq & Vince's musings."
4,Healing the Nation,I have reviews that have been submitted to me. How may I submit them for posting for Healing the Nation?Dorothy Swygert rekindletheheart@yahoo.com
5,Like this item,"I had used a similar product in motel rooms and thought I would try it. Along with the Arc shower curtain, it has turned my shower experience from a chore to a pleasantry. I have a small shower, and the window really helped to open it up. Love the light. I was hesitant about turning in my pretty curtain for this plain one, but it has grown on me. The color is soft. The quality is very good and I love the hookless feature."
3,Not really Beige,The color of the shower curtain is much lighter in person than it appears on the photo. It is more of an ivory than a beige.
5,One year later; still looks and performs like new,"I've waited over a year to review this product (more out of laziness than design)...so trust me, it's durable. At first I thought: hmmm, it's not the highest quality vinyl. But the more I see what's offered today at Target and Walmart, I have to disagree with myself. I think this is far superior.My friend just bought a new shower curtain, and while I didn't ask her for it's dimensions, I could see that it's very skimpy compared to mine.I bought two curtains: one used in the usual fashion and the other across the back wall to protect the window. They look very nice, not at all chintzy. I usually wipe down the window panels with a faux chamois after showers, and they are still clear. I've had no mold, ripping, or any other problems. After more than a year, both curtains look brand new. I'm extremely happy with this purchase.Plus as another reviewer mentioned, no more Hitchcockian shower phobias."
2,Not satisfied...,"It wasn't what I expected, definitely not as nice as the one in the hotel like we'd stayed at. I found it to be stiffer and less attractive than the picture. I ended up returning the item. I would save your money and buy something you can see first."
4,Great product except for one thing,I love that it does not use hooks. the weight is very nice and it moves well. its simple clean and looks really modern. i dont like that it dosent have magnets on the bottom of the curtain. and a bit more material would be nice but since i cant find the hookless style anywhere more convenient then amazon i have to say i love it and when friends come over they love it too. the price is also very good for this style i am satisfied minus one star for the magnets.
4,Shower Curtain with window,I ordered this same shower curtain years ago off of one of those TV stores and paid a lot more. I had it for 5 years. It's well worth the price.
2,Save Your Money,"This shower curtain isn't much better than the $4 liner I can get at the grocery store. It's the kind of curtain you might find at a really cheap, off-the-beaten-track motel where you better wear flip-flops in the shower or you'll get foot fungus. The hookless design does work so it's a shame a better curtain material wasn't used. But as is, it's not at all attractive, flimsy and doesn't hang well. I'll be getting rid of it as soon as I find a decent replacement. I'm surprised there are so many good reviews of this item."
3,"Loved it - for 6 months, then the waterproofing wore off","Loved the shower curtain - the window let in light, & allowed the kids to come into the bathroom on occasion without loss of privacy. I washed it about once a month. All of a sudden, after about 6 months, it completely lost the waterproofing. I will have to replace it now, but I can't just add a liner because of the hookless design. Will have to replace the whole thing, but I hate to lose my window :-(This was my first fabric shower curtain, so I'm not sure if the waterproofing always wears off after a while...."
3,"If ivory will work for you,","you may like it fine. As another reviewer noted, the color is much lighter than expected from the listing. Our bathroom remodel isn't complete yet, so I haven't had a chance to use it, but the color isn't really what I want and I may end up returning it (I may also keep it as a spare - I'm quite short so clear section height isn't an issue for me - and neither is privacy)."
5,hookless shower curtain,We love this product. My kids were constantly tearing the shower curtain off the rings by pulling the curtain open and closed to hard. This product eliminates that problem - no more tears. The see-through window lets light into the shower as well as allows you to see out without exposing to much if someone walks into the bathroom while your showering.Highly recommended product.
3,Vision Shower Curtain,I first used one of these shower curtains in a motel and loved it. This one is splitting at the seam where the clear and almond seams meet.
4,Great shower curtain,This vinyl shower curtain is grea! The hookless feature allows for a 2-minute install and the vinyl is easy to keep clean. I didn't give it 5 stars as it could be a tad longer as water sometime shoots over the top. I have tried both fabric and vinyl hookless shower curtains and vinyl is the best. The fabric curtains do not repel the water as stated and they must be washed frequently to prevent mold from growing.
5,Great addition to bathroom,"Good quality - the ""clear"" window section of the curtain is great, and it's placed just at the right height. The hookless feature makes it a snap to put up the shower curtain. Glad I bought this."
5,Fabulous Historical Read,"Having just returned from a 9 day canoe trip through the Stillwater Canyon on the Green River, I can honestly say that this book added a great deal of enjoyment to the trip. Every float day began with a reading from the book to explain the history of each bottom as we passed by. The hiking descriptions were what one expects from Kelsey: great if you are experienced and use it as a guide, lacking if you need your hand held the whole way. Get this book if you are canoeing the flat waters of Canyonlands. (In general I find the Belknap guide book easier to use for actual river navigation.)"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this vacuum (not on Amazon) and it's horrible. The attachments are imposible to change, the power nozel is very stiff and hard to vacuum with, and I ended up breaking some of the attachments trying to put them on and take them off. I wouldn't suggest this vacuum."
1,Natural Flood,"Unbelievable leaks and spills. In spite of adhering to the directions ""DO NOT FILL BEYOND THIS LINE"", bottle constantly leaks and spills. Particularly when you warm the bottle. If you don't mind frequent dripping then purchase, if you don't have time to change your baby due to being drenched by leaks don't buy them. They are horrible portable bottles as well."
4,Full of Powerful Story and Character,"""Folly"" by Susan Minot is a wonderfully written tale of a woman's choice in a time when a woman's marriage is everything. This tale of heartbreak and intrigue is fabulous. I was fascinated by this decision a wonderfully charismatic woman must make. It has a tremendous amount of charm and heart. It's very well written with a lot of emotion and power. There are moments of ""The Age of Innocence"" by Edith Wharton (which is a classic and can't be surpassed) but, this novel certainly has a lot going for it. I was very happy with my read. I recommend it."
4,"great details, flawless prose","In what might otherwise be a boring story, the great writing and perfect details make this compelling reading. An amazingly talented writer."
2,Don't know why I bothered to finish this book,I kept trying to persuade myself that this book was going to improve and reach some kind of climax. It however proved very disappointing. My worst read for this year so far. Terribly boring - no point to it really.
2,Stopped working after 18 months.,I've read several online post and a lot of complaints are being made about the Toshiba DVD/VCR combo SD-V393. A lot of these models have stopped working after only a little over a year of use. I bought this product in December 2005 from Sears. I thought that the power connection was loose but realized the DVD/VCR had died. Previous use of this item was great but I feel that buying a product that will only last a little more than a year is not reliable.
5,I love it!,I still have this product years later. I love the name brand Toshiba. I have 2 Toshiba TVs. They're products are excellent and the durability is amazing. I highly recommend this product.
1,piss poor vcr,"the toshiba vcr combo arrived, and was quite light in weight. it hooked up ok, but the orange (nice color) display, constantly stayed on zeros, and the vcr played tapes so bad, there was always a white static streak across the screen bottom. i sent it back after trying a few tapes (all tested poor.) better to get a good vcr for good vhs picture display quality."
3,Not As Advertised,"I called Amazon to complain about the description of the item. It does not have the ""Up Conversion and Memory Slot"" described in the product listing. There used to be a picture of the product, which showed the memory slot, and I was frankly surprised that the unit lacked it. So clearly they had a picture of another unit, as the model number is correct.P.S. The machine completely died after about a year of very light use."
1,"Great idea, bad technology","This is the 3rd DVD/VCR unit (not necessarily Toshiba products) that I have purchased and each unit develops the same problem over a 3 month time period. On this unit the VCR part has not worked at all, eats the tape and turns the unit off until you can pry the tape out. The others had the same problem - one the DVD stopped working as well.When this DVD player stops working I think I am going to replace with just one unit."
1,Beware this and other Toshiba DVD players,"This player does not play DVDs. I would estimate that only 10% of my DVDs play without skipping or pausing on this player. My mom also has a Toshiba TV/DVD player combo, and it does the same thing.Also:The remote is cheap and the buttons are too small.The response time on menu navigation is slow."
5,Beautiful!,"I really love these CDs. Kathryn Stott is a most remarkable pianist. Her touch is flexible and musicianship is peerless. She brings out the essence of these elusive pieces. I heard several other pianists play Faure, but Stott is overall most impressive. Very well recorded also. Strongly recommended for anyone who loves music of Faure."
5,Great item!,I didnt want to spend the $18.00 on theese strips because I doubted them.. Luckily I had a coupon from Michaels it was 50% off one item so I bought the 4 pack. The strips worked well . My cakes come out perfect I also use them when I make cheesecakes it is easier than the waterbath method!
3,Baking Strips,"To tell the truth, I have never used them. I can't offer any opinions of their worthiness. I bought them in anticipation of using them to bake cheesecakes, but I just failed to wrap the pans. The cheese cakes turned out fine so I will put them in the 'garage sale' stock room.."
3,They work OK,"They help a little bit. They work better when wet. They are hard to pin in place.I really don't like the idea of using straight pins around food. I guess I would notice if one fell off and somehow landed in the cake, but I wish they had some oven-proof velcro or snaps."
1,useless,"Save your money -- I used these strips on three occasions today, and they did not work at either time. The cakes were still higher in the middle and seemed to take a MUCH longer time to bake. Fabric is incredibly difficult to pin to the pan when wet -- especially with the cheap pins included in the manufacturer's package. They also shrank more each time I used them, making it harder to fit them around the girth of the pan. Really not worth the money. Next time I'm going to try a different tip I found -- using a wet strip from an old terry towel. Can't be any worse than this product. I bought these because my towels are too nice to cut into strips, but I'm regretting not making the sacrifice."
3,A little disappointing,"So far I have been a little disappointed in the bake even strips performance. I've only used them twice and the cakes did come out flatter, but not flat, more of a funky collapsed dome."
2,A flop for baking,I don't know if I was doing it wrong or if it's just a dud but these strips ended up making the sides of my cake dry and hard. Definitely not going to use them again so I'm glad they weren't too expensive.
4,Makes cakes look nice,"I've used these for years. They do work very well in keeping a cake from getting that round, dome top. But they are a little cumbersome. After they get soaked, it's a little difficult to pin them tightly on the pan. They are held by a single pin. All in all, they do their job just fine and make a nice, level, flat-topped cake."
1,Waste of money,I wasted my money here. I did not see the bit about pins and I did not receive any. I can't find any pins lying around so now I have strips lying at the bottom of my oven and a burn on my finger from trying to remedy the situation.And seriously I could make my own strip of fabric with a pin. Surely a commercial product should stick together?
3,burn,"This product worked great on cake pans, but burned on pumpkin pie . Maybe I shouldn't have used them on something that overflowed in oven. Otherwise, worked well on cake pans."
5,Great speakers. Great bass.,"I've had these speakers for a couple of years now, and they rock. I use them in my basement, hooked up to an older Onkyo 100 watt receiver, and they sound awesome. They deliver excellent highs, and outstanding bass. I listen to all types of music. These are the best 2 channel speakers I've ever had, and I've had speakers that cost 3 times as much. They're a great value now for under $200."
5,absolutely outstanding quality,"these are outstanding sounding speakers and i just paired them with the ve 5c center channel and you dont realize what your home theater is missing until you complete it with cerwin vega. i have an onkyo 770 watt 7.1 channel receiver that cant keep up with them. they just laugh and say huh ""is that all you got"". You can push the hell out of these speakers and they keep wanting more. im gonna need to buy an amp now because i borrowed one and hooked it up to my receivers preouts and it rocked my house plumb of the blocks. simply amazing."
5,Cerwin Vega is the way to go,"I purchased a pair of cerwin vega tower speakers VE-12 3-way and when I hooked them up to my JVC 7.1 receiver I could not beleive the sound and clareity these speakers produced. The bass, midrange and highs was what I was looking for in a sound system. Money well spent."
4,GREAT,"Speakers are awesome and I've always loved Cerwin Vegas. Only problem I had was with the shop I bought them from ( woodwind & Brass , the bass was busted on one speaker and they just ignored the problem and excuse they kept using was , we don't find any contact information regarding this issue. I wouldn't recommend this seller as they don't stand behind the products they sell."
4,oh I love Tommy Bolin really!,"Folks!I'd grown up with the music, deep purple has composed in the middle of 70's. This rehearsal recordings was taped in june 1975 by the engineer Robert Simon. At that time DP was searcing for the new guitar man, after the legendary Ritchie Blackmore left in that same year. The search on Tommy Bolin's name was on. The materials of Deep purple MK IV rehearsal on that day were absolutely rarities, because they have never sung the numbers such as statesborough blues, Last of the long jam, drifter on stage. Tommy Bolin was ahero in this album, his guitar playing is absolutely grander than grander.Finally in 2000, Robert Simon gave the original tape to the DPAS chief Simon Robinson in the UK.PS: A must for all deep purple fans & lovers."
3,"good JAM, but this is a cool rehearsal!","MARK IV incarnation was not bad,....the Deep Purple fans around the world cannot condemn BOLIN, because he was not ritchie Blackmore! he has played guitar with his own skill,..he did not try to copy Blackmore on the string guitar. the last of the long jam is agood Jam,...the Stateboro blues is a cool blues rock song. A Must for Purple Fans"
5,Fantastic. Rod has his old raspy goosebump feeling voice back.,"This album contains Elton John's Your Song Which I never Knew He did. Beleive Me, I am an addict. I seen him for the 56th time this year in vegas front row and his sweat dripped on me. He is amazing. One great song after another. Ranks right up there with every picture tells a story. enjoy"
3,Borderline Cat:some catchy stuff&Others that are no comment,Rod Stewart has been around a long time&sometimes you have to be reminded of that.He has never really been a Album Artist to me but understood a catchy song&video.in fact through the 80's to me Stewart's biggiest thing was the One big song&video&be done.some of these tracks I still dig but others just don't move me at all.I don't buy Him as the stylist Act that His Record Label is pushing Him up to be but the songs that work still sound good to me.
2,ONE FOR THE DOGS,"The MANEATER franchise hits rocl bottom with this laughably bad film. Actor Rick Schroder directs with little imagination and the effects lame. The cast including a quasi-cameo from Ben Cross is ineffective to be kind. Also for supposedly immortal pups, the titular characters die pretty easily. The hellhounds are also seen sparingly.While previous MANEATERS aren't classics, they were entertaining...sadly, HELLHOUNDS isn't."
5,Hellhounds,Dog gone good movie times 3. I highly recommend for anyone who is looking for a title that will really grab them.
2,Canines From Hell,"Sword-and-sandals meet horror in ""Hellhounds."" After his young bride is poisoned on their wedding day, a brave warrior and his loyal comrades descend into the underworld to retrieve her soul. Challenged at every turn by one horror after another, they return from their chilling journey to find they are not alone; they've been tracked by a pack of snarling, savage beasts that kill everything in their path. Lou Diamond Phillips stars.The only interesting thing about this low-budget flick is the combination of ancient times with modern, grisly special effects. The movie is not for those easily turned off by the sight of blood -- a lot of it. There are no bonus extras."
4,interesting...,"i thougth this book was pretty good, alot of things in it that i didn't know about before, some parts of the book like world wars and star track didn't catch my attention, but just about everything else did."
1,B-O-R-I-N-G Book of Useless Info,There are definitely better useless info books out there. This books is totally useless and boring - did not find anything of real interest. I advise purchasing ONLY if you see it at the 99 Cent Store. My 12 bucks was definitely too much for such rubbish.
5,This is very funny,"When British comedy is on, it is on. This is one of the funniest satires I have ever seen."
1,Supercreep,Steve Coogan steals kids toys and soils them with his X Ray eyes. Knowing Me Knowing You is nowhere near as funny as his Alan Partridge sitcom or the Day Today. David Schneider and Patrick Marner deserve better than this. Eat my GOOAAAL!
2,Needs a little more work,My experience with this book was more confusion than teaching. There are to many unfinished thoughts in the examples and when the problems at the end of several chapters were solved the answers in the book were incorrect. NEEDS WORK !
4,Rashid-Microelectronics,Complete book with many practical examples of easy reading. It is a good reference for the student and for the electronic designer.
1,poor quality,I find this book very confusing. The fact that it has no website that I can find for revisions even makes it worse. The answers in the back of the book are for the most part incorrect. Information is missing on various problems. It uses way too many variables without enough description of what they actually are. Poor quality text. The only good thing about the book is the pspice integration.
1,too small grip,"I had to return the item without opening the package because the grip was too small. I have small hands. Even though, only two fingers will fit comfortably and three fingers will fit tight. My husband didn't think he can put his fingers in. This is supposed to be shears for kitchen not craft. I need full grip."
2,Not the same,My original six disc CD magazine worked perfectly. This one easily starts skipping and doesn't properly fit. I have to do a strange maneuver any time I want to get the CD magazine out of my car.
5,Force 5!,Bong Soo Han as the cult leader vs Joe Lewis and ... Benny 'The Jet' Urquidez.Remember the line Thank God for Black and Decker! ..Great martial arts film. Trash but fantastic.
2,faulty (absent) center sound channel,"The DVD I recently received had nothing recorded for the middle sound channel; otherwise the production, video and dancing were excellent and worth 5 stars if the center sound channel had been present.Louis and Janet Schlom"
1,Bulbs do not last,"Unfortunately I can't give it zero stars. A waste of money at any price. A bright light, but it keeps blowing bulbs after just a few on-off cycles. I have tried both the 12100 replacement bulb and the 12110 Krypton replacement bulb.The 16-inch BAL uses a different style bulb and seems to have a long enough bulb life, but is not as bright.Both Bend-A-Light's have needed switch replacements. You might want to keep spares on hand."
4,Interesting Item,"I think this item will come in handy, but I wasn't happy with the vendor whom I ordered from through amazon. The packaging was substandard and I am just glad it wasn't broken upon arrival."
1,This books ok,I really thought this book wasn't good at all it didn't have ebough information. Please if your going to writ a book try writing a good one. One that acually has some good information in it. Thanx a bunch.signing off Jessica
3,Not great to my ears,"I had great expectations, but am disappointed. Several times in the first movement they are (or seem) too fast for my taste, like they are in a hurry to finish the first movement.I think I heard this cadenza (or this similar part) before with kremer/harnoncourt (who bring piano in it!) , but it is pretty bad and the part 18:30 to 19:15 completely break the mood/continuity of the first movement and is really horrible to my ears. I am not sure what cadenza they play, but I went back to Oistrakh, Mullova and like them way better. Personally, even if it is what was played at the time, it ruins it for me.And in the third movement, the 'magic' I hear with Oistrakh, Mullova(around 3:10 in this recording) is gone to my ears.I personally way prefer the Gardiner/Mullova version to this one to pick a recent recording and Oistrakh or others for an older recording."
4,A real page turner,"This book is perfect for the everyday Titanic buff or even if you just like mysteries and the supernatural. This book was given to me from a friend and for three days I wasn't able to put it down. From it I got information about the Titanic I had never heard, and the plot along with it's characters was extremely entertaining. The author's use of imagery in this book is fabulous. He painted an all too vivid image of the Titanic resting two and a half miles below the Atlantic's surface. There were a few points in the book when the story was a little slow going, but it's well worth it. I highly recommend this book. It's sure to give you a whole new perspective of the Titanic and of what greed can do to you."
3,Ehhh...,"This book was not quite as good as I hoped it would be. I loved the premise (Ballard was not really the first one to find the Titanic, there was a first expedition in 1975 and the book is split in two between this first expedition and one in 1995) but the pacing of the book was off. It was too slow-moving when it should be faster and too brief where more detail would have been nice. What was interesting as well was that this book was first published about 7 years before the blockbuster film, _Titanic_. Several times while reading this book, I wondered if the screenwriters or director had read this as well. Aside from the terrible title, this book had a lot of potential so it is a real shame that its execution ruined it. The characters were not strong, or dynamic enough to make up for the pacing problem either. The point-of-view could have also been improved by sticking more to one central character. The book's originality though, did make it a worthwhile read."
3,Bad editing,"The book starts great, but sort of dwindles towards the end. One major source of irritation is the mixing up of data. Although the second half takes place in 1995, there are several instances where the author mixes up 1995 with 1993 (from 1995 to 2000 it really is only five years and not seven as described). He can't seem to make up his mind. Maybe it was a bit premature of him to thank his editor in the end note? All in all: not too bad, but not great either. Decent pulp reading for those lost hours in transit on an airport."
2,"Okay, but not the best","It's not that great of a suspense novel. Only parts of it are page turners. I kept setting it down for a few weeks, then picking it up and reading some, then putting it down for another week.. but I eventually got through it."
3,a list of songs on this CD,"1. Hey Jude - Wilson Pickett2. Lady Madonna - Fats Domino3. Yesterday - Marvin Gaye4. Let It Be - Aretha Franklin5. Come Together - Ike & Tina Turner6. Day Tripper - Otis Reading7. And I Love Him - Esther Phillips8. I Want to Hold Your Hand - Al Green9. Can't Buy Me Love - The Supremes10. Michelle - The Four Tops11. Got to Get You Into My Life - Earth, Wind & Fire12. Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds - Natalie Cole"
5,Amazing,I love this album. It's absolutely amazing. Their sound is just phenomenal. I'm so very impressed with the choir and their conductor! The pieces they chose are ridiculously difficult and the girls perform them beautifully.
3,What price verismo?,"I don't know what Amazon's ""sourcing fee"" is supposed to indicate, but it shows up here (as it does on many older Decca releases). Whatever it is, there's no need to pay it; as of this writing (early 2010), you can find it elsewhere at half the price quoted here. The search is well worth it if you like this opera, as you won't currently find a better recording. 1 star for pricing, 4 stars for performance."
3,RUN OF THE MILL VERISMO,"BORING, IN SPITE OF THE IMPECCABLE BUT FLAWED CAST. IT'S NOT THEIR FAULT, IT'S THE MUSIC'S. TEBALDI MADE THIS ONE OF HER SIGNATURE ROLES, SUNG, AS USUAL WITH HER, WITH GREAT VOCALISM BUT NO FEELING WHATSOEVER. DEL MONACO BELLOWS HIS WAY THROUGHOUT. ONLY DIAZ SEEMS TO UNDERSTAND VERISMO SINGING. HOWEVER, IT IS PROBABLY THE ""WALLY"" TO HAVE, IF ONLY BECAUSE OF THEIR PRESENCE."
1,Don't get this game!!!,"Well guys, the Myth games series started 5-6 years ago, now it is getting repetitive and this last Myth 3 is the less cool of the whole series, because it's incomplete (sorta of half-release) and because it's just a bad clone of Myth 2.Guys, Myth was very original 5 years ago, now we needed new good ideas and new cool units, that didn't happened.I think bushido for Myth 2 is much better than Myth 3 <--- this is for people not new at Myth.I hope that one day some ppl with fresh and good ideas and good knowledge of making games will release Myth 4 because Myth 3 is a enormous flop.Well, don't buy it!"
2,Myth has Fallen to the wolves,I was so looking forward to Myth 3. Then it arrived. I never have been so let down. The quality of theis game has collapsed into a sad poor shadow of it's previous two versions. Myths previous versions are still on my best tactical games ever but this version is going into the biggest waste of money. Everything you loved about myth is gone and replaced with tiny doom figues and lame reality engine.Avoid this one or suffer through the biggest let down in game history.
1,Lot of bugs! And no other patches will come!,"If you buy this game, probably it won't work on your computer because of the several bugs it has and you will return it, after a bad waste of time. This game has lot of problems and the patch has fixed nearly half of them and probably no other patches will come, because the developers are not longer supporting this game. This lack of support is really bad and bad again...BR>If you guys are new at the myth series just buy myth2, it's much better and it still has an enjoyble community."
1,Could anyone make a game less fun?,"How could they have gotten it all so wrong? Playing this game is less entertaining than work! Myth I and Myth II were fun. Myth III is tedium. In Myth III, the camera height isn't adjustable, the time can't be slowed or sped up, and it's difficult to move troops around. Overall, it is an excersize in frustration. If you buy this game, you will not be happy with your purchase."
2,Tedious,"I've been a huge fan of the Myth series. I was a huge fan of Marathon as well (another ground-breaking Bungie game series). So, I was really looking forward to Myth III.Unfortunately, I found that while the graphics were somewhat upgraded, the gameplay suffered tremendously with the transfer of the game to Mumbo Jumbo. It was just no fun.Everything is a slog-fest. Keep playing the levels over and over and you'll eventually get through, but there is no subtlety, no style, no real interest. No fun. I quit after level 5.Everything runs ponderously on my machine, too, even though I have decent hardware. I think the move to a fully 3D engine cost more than it benefitted the game.I hope Bungie does great things for XBox. It would be a real shame if their light is gone from the world of gaming."
3,they ruined it!,Not as good as the first 2 games - gone are the anime cutscenes we loved and all of the cool voices and sound effects. they are replaced by some really cheesy new voice actors and shoddy movies. It's obvious Bungie had really hardly anything to do with this - they would never have dreamed of releasing such a poorly put together project. Bring back Bungie!
2,Leave Wolf Age to the dogs,"I bought this game because I loved Myth I and II. Myth III has not lived up to its predecessors at all, and the reason for this is because they changed the characters to 3-D models. While this may seem trivial, in fact the characters move slower and just don't feel like part of the Myth experience of old. Also, the designers made Myth III too specific by creating a pseudo-Celtic atmosphere that is disconnected from Myth I and II. On the plus side, the game looks great, and I also got it for free - so I guess I should hold my tongue.What a sad way to end such a great series on such a weak note."
2,Myth I was much better,"Myth 3 has too many characters per army. In Myth 1, the relatively small size of your army allowed for manageable and effective tactics. Myth 3's armies are huge and unmanageable. For instance, at the beginning of any scenario there is time to select sub-divisions of your army and associate each with a hot key pattern. In Myth 1, I could do this in seconds. In Myth 3, there are so many characters, spread over such a large area, that I have yet to satisfactorily complete my sub-selections before the scenario begins. And then, as the battle progresses, I have a hard time managing my numerous forces over the large area of the map."
4,Not quite up to standard - - -,"It is NOT your fault: years ago I bought several Starrett 6"" rules and one by one they've 'disappeared' in the vicinity of friends, -in-laws and the like.These are a disappointmentbecause they're thinner and less wide than my originals. THey ARE just as clearly visible and well-made as my originals - - - but they are lesser. (and just to prove it - Starrett still makes such rules just as long and wide - but thinner!)"
3,Decent product that lacks support,"Functionally this read along bear works great. My 2 year old daughter would play with it and have it read the story. The speaker is rather loud (around a level ""8"" when a level 4 or 5 would suffice).My biggest complaint is that there are only 4 other books ever made for this and they are currently out of print (apparently). There are a couple for sale via Amazon's third party sellers, but they are $16, $32, and $59 dollars respectively. This kind of product needs the books to be available for maybe $8-12, and we need more than 5 total books.We received this as a gift and it's a fun toy. I'm disappointed that I can't get the extra books for my daughter, which she has requested from the back cover of the included story which shows the other ones. Had I bought this, I'd be very upset though."
4,Another Live Album,"Yes it is ""another live album"" but Weller is beginning to acknowledge his past and returns here to a couple of Jam classics. The music is well performed, passionate in a few spots. Well worth the investment if you're a fan, if you are only curious get Modern Classics first."
4,"An excellent eyecup for Olympus E3 Camera, BUT (Easy To Loose)","This eyecup works very well for the glasses wearer. It is well made, and not too expensive. The only problem is in the detent design. It is easyto knock off in the field. I have lost two in six months."
5,Excellent English cathedral recording,"This is absolutely one of my favorite choral CDs. The choir does so many things so well. Diction and intonation are uniformly excellent, and above all the musical phrasing is exquisite throughout. If you like English carols, you really owe it to yourself to get this recording.Note that there are two CDs on this recording--you get more than your money's worth of music. (I should point out that the choir does abbreviate some of the longer hymns--""Once in Royal David's City"" gets cut down to three verses, for example--which I find slightly annoying but others may appreciate.) There is a variety of musical styles, including several hymns with descants, a little bit of Bach and some modern carol settings. There are a few organ solo pieces as well, though these are quite short.I give this recording my very highest recommendation."
4,REVOULUTIONARY,IIan Guetta could not have choosen a better composer to play on the electric guitar. The string quartet only accentuates Guetta's fantanstic guitar palying. Definately a good buy.
4,Good copy of a hardback school version book!,"Was in good condition...a little more notes written in the book than I expected, but all in all a good copy of a school version hardback book... And since it's either insanely expensive or impossible to find hardback versions of this book WITH THE TRANSLATOR E.F. WATLING, this was an extremely good buy!! ((E.F. WATLING IS THE BEST AND MOST ELOQUENT TRANSLATOR OF THE THEBAN PLAYS...HE DOESN'T DUMMY IT DOWN, VERY BEAUTIFULLY TRANSLATED))"
4,flawed yet exciting,The main glory of this set is the singing of the young LucianoPavarotti as Riccardo. The sheer beauty of the voice and hisyouthful exuberance are a real delight. Sherrill Milnes is alsocaught in his youthful prime portraying a strong Renato. HelenDonath is a fresh-voiced and delightful Oscar. There remainsRenata Tebaldi and Regina Resnik - two great singers unfortu-nately caught here a little late in their carreers - the formerrather hard-toned and the latter wobbly - however their artistryand commitment are never in doubt and both offer memorable ifflawed performances. Very well recorded and conducted - at thisbargain price well worth investigating.
2,ouch,"I am so sorry to report that Tebaldi sounds terrible on this recording. If her name was not Tebaldi, one would think they picked some burnt-out second rate singer to do the role. This sounds terribly harsh but it's true. The producers should have known better than to record her at this stage (beyond the end of her great career). Her singing ruins an otherwise moderately good, if unexciting, performance."
2,"A dud, even with the young Pavarotti","I bought this set with high expectations, but even though it features Pavarotti in great voice, his interpretation hadn't matured, as one can hear from his much better Un Ballo under Solti form 1985. His Amelia, Renata Tebaldi, was the reason for making this recording; sadly, she sounds hard-voiced, squawky, and dramatically uninvolving. Resnik is old-sounding as Ulrica, and although eveyrone else is good enough, Bruno Bartoletti's conducting is humdrum. Even a masterpiece can't take this many deficits."
4,Beware the Jabberwock,"Ballo is one of Verdi's most lavishly romantic scores. Its wonders include one of the great love duets. This was the first recording of it I owned, at a time when I was learning opera and singing technique. I thought I didn't like the opera. Eventually I realized I didn't like the soprano, and fell in love with the work as a whole. If you do not know this piece, this is NOT the recording to buy. If you do know Ballo, this recording is more than worth it for the youthful and smooth voiced Pavarotti, the bright Helen Donath, and the amazing Sherrill Milnes. They sing the pants off of this score. Just beware of Renata Tebaldi's Amelia and take her performance within the larger context of this opera and her career."
4,Nice Looking Desk,"I bought this with matching chair for my 4 yr old son to work on homework.It fits him great, its very sturdy and looks like it will hold up for awhile.I love the color, looks very nice in the room.The only issue I have is that is seems like soft wood on top because you can see the mark indented in the table if he presses his pencil too hard and if he takes any toy to it, it scratches up the top, a coat of furniture polish hides it well and I still love it but I wish it didn't mark up so easily."
1,the drawer fell off within 2 weeks upon arrival,The drawer fell off within 2 weeks upon arrival. I had to change the positions of the screws to put the drawer back on.
2,"Heavy, fat and unreliable.","This thing is like almost half an inch thick! If you remember the old G-Shock watches from the 80's; this is bigger and heavier, but way less durable --my first one broke the second day I had it--.The biggest downfall of this watch is that the timer is very unreliable, mainly because if you bend your wrist a little it pushes in the timer and turns it off. For me, this happened more often then not, and found myself constantly frustrated that the watch didn't serve its intended purpose.I hope somebody will one day make a series of light-weight, well designed, attractive standard clock face, vibrating reminder watches... but until they do, I'm just going to buy an ugly digital vibraLITE and keep it in my pocket."
2,Vibrating Watch,I did not care for the watch. It arrived in a damaged box and it did not have any directions. I figured out how to work it on my own. The vibration was weak and a unreliable. Too easy to accidentally hit the button disabling the alarm. I had a VibraLite for seven(7) years. It is a much better product.
3,"Not a ""Feel Good"" read!","Rachel Lee has always been good at dealing with the darker side of life but this book was very depressing and disappointing .Meg is a very depressed recent widow with a runaway and suicidal daughter, an emotionally abusive mother and lots of dark secrets. Earl is the local sheriff and best friend of the deceased husband who has always had feelings for Meg but could never act on them. Earl helps the family bring all of their secrets out into the open and finally his secret love for Meg is returned.If the author is planning on using this as a launch for a new series surrounding Whisper Creek, she didn't do a very good job making me curious about other characters and happenings in the town. I also didn't have especially strong emotions toward either Meg or Earl if they are going to be the main characters to build the series on. The best character in the book was poor Matt the abused teenager.I anxiously await her next book because I know she can do better."
3,ha ha!,"if you are interested in the members of the members of the bloodhound gang, this is the dvd for you! lots of entertainment to be had... too bad the video quality was so crappy, and the sound, and the fact that there was really nothing on here but a few cheap laughs... anyways, it was ok, but might want to wait and steal it from some sucker who buys it. lots of sexual parts, which makes it nice for the lonely girls out there.. :)"
5,Funny...,"i have been a bloodhound gang fan for a couple years and i thought this dvd would have more than a couple videos, and the audio and vidio quality wasn't the best but otherwise is a hillarious dvd (besides the abuse of spanky g) but is a must have for bloodhound gang fans. go buy it!"
4,the child within,"The Christmas season is special to all of us all over the world...for our beliefs,faith,customs and family.This video takes us back to our times of innocents and love and memories.We remember them and hold on to them, that someday our past will equal today,tomorrow and binds our goodness to all"
4,OH Baby!!,This book was great!!! This is actually #2 in a 3 book series...Men of Chance. Be sure to check out Pure Chance by Julie Elizabeth Leto and Chance Encounters by Jill Shalvis. These Chance Brothers will give you the warm and fuzzies all over. This one did get into the psychological area a bit much at times but some of it was important to the story line. The characters really did care for each other and Ms. Porter portrayed that time and time again...(thank you Ü)! A fabulous read--you won't be disappointed!
2,Get Over It Already,"I'm generally rather non-critical of romance novels - I read them for lighthearted fun, as long as I'm entertained I'm happy. But this book just drags on and on and on... I wound up wanting to yell at both main characters - get over it all ready! The author seems to have tried for a psychological story line, exploring emotional hang ups the characters didn't even know they had. But the therapy sessions are unbelievable. The mental explorations are tedious. Very disappointing."
2,This book reads more like a psychology manual,"Her Only Chance starts out with promise but fizzles by the 3rd chapter. Kellan Chance and Jamie Winslow are former sweethearts and were once engaged to be married. After leaving him at the altar once and walking out on him for the second time, Jamie must find closure with Kellan to get her license to practice psychology. I found the two characters analyzed each other far too much and I started to feel like I was reading a psychology manual instead of a romance. I also found the heroine to be irritating and selfish and the hero was not as strong as I thought he would have been. I was disappointed by this book since the first book in the series was so good."
5,Once upon a time the Gods spoke through a man!!,"Consider this, Billy joel is in the Rock n Roll hall of fame and Marc Bolan is not. SHUDDER!!! What are those people thinking. The only thing I can come up with is that Bolans music goes right over there little pea brains. Come to think of it, whats so great about being in the Hall of... if the Slider ain't there. Answer: It ain't that great.Oh yeah the record Beard of stars. Well.... its like all of Bolans material, PURE DAZZLING GENIUS misunderstood except by a lucky minority. ROCK ON IN HEAVEN MARC!! LOVE ALWAYS"
2,And the point of that review was... ?,"I read another review that expressed really well what I thought of this book. No story development, no character development, no plot.... in a word: pointless. But the other reviewer went on to recommend the book. There's where my opinion differs. I agree that the book was readable, that (and my curiousity) was what kept me from giving up on it entirely by the time I was half way through. But once I'd finished it I wondered what the point of it had been. Bottom line is it's not as bad as some books I've read but it's completely unmemorable."
5,PUPPY LOVE,".This is a charming little picture book. If you are planning to have a new dog join your household soon this would be a good way to get a child enthusiastic about all the fun you can have with a pooch as a pet.We learn about all the realities of dog ownership such as, jumping up on the bed, making a mess and pleading to share your dinner.The real bonus of dogs as companions is the welcome they give when you come home. They are always happy to see you.Although some readers might like to see mention of realities like the need for de-sexing, remember childhood should be all about fun, plus learning a few responsibilities. Leave the reality checks (like Vets bills) to mother and father!."
1,Cell phone case too small for HTC TYTN,The case I received was too small for my htc TYTN. Contacting customer services wasn't helpful at all. I was questioned whether I know how to fit a cell phone case and whether I have a exteneded life battery (which isn't available on this phone).I told them that I almost have to tear the case apart to fit the phone in and don't want to do it again. But they insist that they need to a see a picture of how the case doesn't fit and I eventaully torn the plastic front cover right off the leather back portion of the case. So I send them the pictures of the torn case and After about four email exchange customer service went silent on me.Save your money. Don't buy this!!
1,Case will NOT FIT Cingular 8525!!!,This case looks nice in the photos; but don't be fooled. DO NOT make the mistake of buying this case if you own a Cingular 8525. If you observe closely you will notice that the phone in the photos is not a 8525 (I noticed it after buying the case!). This case was NOT DESIGNED for the 8525. Unfortunately when I bought this case the other reviews saying the same thing were not yet present. I am going to try to return it & hopefully will get my money back.DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE A CINGULAR/AT&T; 8525!!!
3,Decent case -- won't work with the extended battery though.,"I wanted a decent protective case for my 8525. However, I also wanted the longer life battery. You apparently can't have everything you want since the larger battery ""sticks out"" in the back and therefore, this case no longer fits. Oh well. I take a live phone in a non custom case in place of a dead battery in a custom case any day of the week."
4,Krussell Leather case for Cingular 8525,"ProsFits well, protects smartphone/pda, camera & screen, can use slide out keyboard with little effort, flips down to reveal camera lens - easy to take pictures, able to reach charger connection, stylus & most buttons easily, can use other Krussell clips on backConsStiff - hard to get on and harder to get off if you need to get to the battery. Plastic even stiffer & too thick - can't write on screen thru it and it can 'catch' when you try to slide keyboard back in. Clip too large - I used another smaller Krussel clip that I had. The on/off button abuts the leather part of the case & can be a little hard to press correctly at times."
3,Bake Even Strips,"The Bake-Even Strips do exactly what they advertise....they keep the edges of the cake from cooking too much faster than the middle of the cake, which makes for a more even cake. The strips are fastened with straight pins, which is cumbersome, especially when they're wet and don't want to stay on the pan. As a baker, I consider them worth the hassle of using, but would like to see a simpler application."
1,"A bad purchase because, unfortunately . . .",". . .they don't work! I recently purchased and used these strips -- twice and using two different recipes -- to bake layer cakes for two ice cream cakes. Because I was creating ice cream cakes (center layer was ice cream), I wanted the cakes to be as level as possible. That didn't happen. They baked with rounded tops -- in my still-new gas oven -- and they created large air holes in both cakes. I have been baking cakes for over 50 years and I have never had air bubbles of such a size in any cake, baked in any oven. The crowning touch: they oozed a black substance onto my oven racks -- the filling inside the strips, I believe. Yes, I followed all the instructions. I have returned them to Baker's Catalog and received a refund."
3,They can be useful,"These baking strips do help in keeping the cake even. The only issue I have is adjusting them to the pan. It might take a couple of tries before you actually get it somewhat snug. I don't know if I would ever replace these if I needed too. I find that with the right temperature, the cakes bake pretty even."
2,Cake still cracked or was uneven...disappointed,"I thought these were going to make the cakes even to make icing easier and make cheesecakes not crack. However, I was disappointed on both occasions. Maybe I didn't use them properly (it can't be rocket science), but I'll try again nonetheless. I should mention that it's possible these are only meant for round pans without the latch for the spring? That's the only reason I can think of why they didn't work."
4,Luke Vibert/BJ Cole '- Stop The Panic,"STOP THE PANIC, Luke Vibert's collaboration with pedal steel guitarist BJ Cole, starts off on the right foot with the Western hoedown of ""Swing Lite--Alright."" ""Dischordzilla"" stomps around with thick slabs of sound, while ""Start the Panic"" mixes breaks, exotica, and hip-hop samples (though the vocals sound a bit discordant; on ""Nice Cave"" they work much better). The country plucking on ""Hipalong Hop"" adds some perky fun, but it's with ""Fly Hawaii"" that Cole's guitar really takes center stage. They take a relaxed approach with ""This Stuff Is Fresh,"" which has a dreamy quality, while they're just having a laugh with ""Cheng Phooey."" The dance party gets underway with the electric bass underpinning ""Party Animals,"" but ""Watery Glass Planet (Pt.3)"" throws a spanner in the works with a twisted, meandering track. ""Songs Of The Night Life"" harkens back to the opening, though with a shuffly beat that works quite well. A fun album, if with a few slight missteps."
4,Fun for now...,"The mood from the first note is Hawaiian. Luke Vibert and BJ Cole have taken one more step into the already crowded world of ""Trip Hop"" and somehow managed to turn what could be conceived as a gimmick into something surprisingly fresh. BJ Cole, known for his slide guitar, and Vibert for his turntables are indeed an unlikely couple, but nonetheless successful. Whilst the combo of Hawaiian grooves and DJ scratches proves successful on this trial run, it does wear slightly thin towards the end of the album. Hopefully there will be only one Hawaiian trip hop album this year, or the next."
5,Attack on the USS Cole foreshadowed!!,"I read a lot of this military thrillers, especially ones that deal with the Mideast. But this one is eerie. Although I just bought it recently, it was first published this spring. However, it foreshadowed the attack on the USS Cole. This one is too close to the truth!"
4,Good read with plenty of action,"This was an impulse buy summer read. I've been attracted to military action novels for a long time and this cover promised action. The book delivered. At first I found the plot a bit of a stretch, but as I got into the book it began to dawn on me that this could really happen someday. The question is when. I don't know what the checks and balances are in the military to prevent something like this from happening. What this book brought to me from a literary standpoint were some of Joseph Conrad's darker novels...the themes about what people can do when put under enormous pressure are worth thinking about deeply. Doing so within the context of a novel makes it interesting and not a chore. I'd recommend this to my friends - and not just as a summer thriller."
2,Juvenile wordsmithing,"The good & bad of the plot have been discussed by other reviewers. I found that the single most annoying part of the book was the way the author had characters interact. ""John, I think you're right."" ""Thank you, Ben"". ""And John, we should plan ahead"" ""You're right too, Ben"". Think about talking with another person, the two of you don't include each other's name in EVERY SINGLE SENTENCE. This is just an example of the type of juvenile wordsmithing that Mr. Galdorisi uses."
1,Poorly written and very unlikely,"If you've never read a good military thriller before and your only exposure to the military comes through CNN, I guess this would be mildly interesting. But the author can't handle dialogue to save his life and he can't get his facts straight. For example, he makes a big thing of the carrier group's isloation, but somehow the CAG is pulling resources from across the Navy. Go read any book written by David Poyer or any book by P.T. Deutermann. James W. Huston is a newer writer doing a great job. But give this Galdorisi guy a pass."
1,"With A Song Called ""Flannel Rain"" How Could You Go Wrong?","I remember watching Touring Band 2000 and thinking how cool it was that the band entered the stage to a string version of Baba by The Who... I thought, ""I'd love to hear that kind of thing with PJ's music""... I bought this album despite what I thought was a really weak selection of songs... (nothing past Vitalogy and really odd choices)... and I'm seriously listening to it as I write... and it's comically bad...If you've ever stopped and wondered why Stone doesn't flex his power and replace everyone in the band with a less than six stringed instrument... buy this record... it will make very clear that Pearl Jam is best heard with guitars and vocals and LOUD..."
1,"Poor Choices, Poor Performance","I, for one, have always been open to hearing PJ's songs in a different light. This effort, however, falls just short of mediocre. The record company that made this must be udner the impression that PJ stopped making recrds after 1994's Vitalogy. Consequently, much of the band's best work, including songs that would be suited to adaptation as string pieces like Parting Ways, Off He Goes and Present Tense. The performances are satisfactory, but definitely not worth the money. Please, if you want PJ music w/ strings, get Binaural or one of the Seattle bootlegs (strings on parting ways)."
3,Mad world tribute is very nice -,"I haven't heard this one, but I see bad reviews... so I wanted to recommend the Mad World string tribute to Pearl Jam. :) Have a nice day."
1,"Poor product,poor customer service","Used this product for about three months. Skin actually looks worse. My eyes slightly burns, thought it was just the smog, and my skin feels like it experienced a mild acid burn. Itches with slight redness. Called customer service, her name was April, that was no help. She just repeats what she is trained to read to the customers, aggressivley defending the non reactive properties of this product, 'fifty people (only fifty?)were tested with no reactions, so its completely safe'. She told me you supposed to feel a mild burn. Really? Not open to complaints except to read what she is told to say. The company behind this product has no responsibilty to the public using their products."
1,Skin actually looks worse!,"I've used this product for 2 months now and as far as I can tell, my skin actually looks worse than before I used it. I do not recommend it. Not worth the money."
5,A++++++,"Love this DVD. If you run or want to run the Double Wing, then you need to add this DVD to your collection. Great addition to this explosive offense."
5,Superb Performances of Sublime Music,"It is amazing that Bach's Partitas are the first compositions that he published, though he had written hundreds of others before them. It is also sobering that he had to pay for their publication, as he did for many of the 12 works that were published in his lifetime. [About 1080 compositions have survived, but it is thought that Bach probably wrote about 2000.]These pieces are among the best of Bach's keyboard works and are played beautifully by Angela Hewitt. I enjoy hearing them played on harpsichord, too, but when they are played on the piano, I want the performer to treat it like a piano as Ms Hewitt does.She plays stylistically, but is not afraid to occasionally use the pedal and to use the dynamic resources of the piano. I also recommend her set of French Suites."
4,Spring Whisk found,"Been looking for one of these for a long time to replace my old one. This one is better in being stainless steel. My old one had rusted. However would have liked a bigger spring on it, as my old one had. Otherwise is good to have one again for those quick beating of eggs and such. It works fine and the stainless steel handle is dish washer safe."
3,Spring Whisk,"Nicely made, but the spring isn't as deep as my previous whisk, limiting up-and-down play and reducing beating action."
1,mostly uninspired faddish typography.,"This book is filled with typography design that seems to have evolved with no knowledge of the past histoy of typographic design. Some of the comments made by the designers had some value, but the examples of their work didn't always match their jargon.The book is boring, uninspiring and I returned my copy. Save your money. There are better books out there."
3,This book should be edited & republished,"In 1964, antipsychiatrists Ronald Laing & David Cooper produced this distillation of 3 works by Sartre that were influential on them: two sections of Sartre's 1960 opus, ""Critique of Dialectical Reason,"" and his 1952 biography, ""Saint Genet."" But ""Reason and Violence"" is an almost impossible read; it is badly edited (with British-style punctuation, which may confuse Americans) & lacks any real format: 3 reviews, 3 sections, but with the earliest, ""Saint Genet,"" sandwiched between the 1957 & 1960 works. This needs to be re-edited & published for a new generation."
4,Too Sweet,"Good product, will not stain sheets or clothing, easily washes off. However, it's a little too sweet tasting."
2,Not as magical as it sounds,"This item is supposed to be warming, but that is not the case at all!The Vanilla Cream is also very strong smelling. (It smells like a combination of sugar cookies and cake frosting.)If you do not like overpowering-sweet fragrances, this is not for you.Being edible is a nice feature, but once again, it is very sweet--tolerable, but not something that I'd want to taste all the time.The packaging is very nice to look at, but the cork top on the bottle is difficult to use...A large chunk of my cork broke off during the first time of use, which now makes opening and closing the oil even worse!Over all, this is just an ordinary massage oil, other fragrances may be more appealing depending on your tastes; However, if you buy this for the warming factor, you should save your money and look for one that has a stronger warming sensation."
1,Fall apart after multiple uses,"The set I have just fell apart after about one month of ""normal"" use. This was my second set. The first set fell apart after one week of use and returned and exchanged them, thinking they were defective. I'm not spending more money on another set and don't want the hassle of exchanging them only to have the next set disintegrate. I like the idea of chemical and perfume free dryer softening, but I'm going to try tennis balls next, and if that doesn't work, I'll go back to dryer sheets. Save you money and don't purchase this item."
1,Dryer Balls,"This product fell apart the first time I used them. I withdrew the negative feedback, and the seller said he would send me a replacement. I've never seen them. I ordered some for a friend...same thing happened."
1,Poor quality-knock off,"I love the ""As seen on Tv"" dryer balls, they worked great but finally had to replace them about after 6 months, but I bought these balls thinking they were the same with a great deal of disappointment. They busted in the first dryer load! GRRR SPEND THE MONEY ELSE WEHRE THIS IS A CRAPPY IMMITATION KNOCK OFF!"
1,Poor quality,"Don't waste your money. We received these as a gift. After a few months, one of the balls fell apart into huge chucks of plastic. We followed all of the instructions-the product was just cheap and not worth it."
2,They don't last long,"I bought these less than six months ago. I do have to say that they did make a difference and my clothes were softer and did take less time to dry. However, it was only 3 months before the first ball split in half. the packaging said that they could last up to two years. Due to the static electricity I still used my downy ball. I really wouldn't reccommend this product. It seems like a waste of money to me, but then again I don't have to pay for utilities so it really doesn't make a difference to me how long my clothes take to dry."
1,Cheap knock-off. Avoid. Much harder and noisier than the others,"I had originally puchased a pair of the DryerMax Dryer Balls, also available on Amazon. Mysteriously, one of the pair disappeared from the dryer (just like socks!), so I wanted to replace it. I didn't realize there were such strong differences between Dryer Balls offered on Amazon. When I ordered this pair, they were hard as rocks. When I started the dryer, the noise of the impacts was unacceptable. The DryerMax balls, on the other hand, are squishy."
1,Just buy some tennis balls,"If you ever gleamed anything from frugal relatives, it's that you can put two tennis balls into the dryer to dry the clothes faster. I've even heard Martha Stewart say to do it. These 'dryer balls' are just a way to bank on that old home remedy. Plus, tennis balls are very cheap and will likely last much longer."
1,Put holes in our clothes!,"I found dryer balls like these at Walmart and got them to replace costly dryer sheets and to shorten dryer time. They worked pretty well so when I saw these for such a cheap price ($1.97) I got them as I heard using around 6 balls was the best way to get them to work. Well I noticed a difference right away. These are made from a very stiff plastic unlike my original 2 which are softer. I was very concerned when they filled my laundry room with plastic fumes when I use them, but the worst part yet was that my cotton tees started to have small holes in them after I started using these. I have since ditched all 4 blue plastic dryer balls and bought six natural wool dryer balls (my review of them will be left on their listing)."
1,Dryer Balls,I have used dryer balls before and needed new ones. So I ordered these and within a few weeks I keep finding little pieces of the ball in the dryer. They continue to lose their little spikes on the balls. My last balls lasted for years these are ready for the garbage. I can't return them as the window for return expired and it's only been a few months. I would not buy these again!!!
5,Whitmor dryer balls,Best set I have purchased so far that have a plastic/rubber feel to them. They lasted almost a year before they finally broke down from average use in the dryer.
2,Poor Quality,Disappointed about the quality. One of the two balls broke down within two weeks and the other leaves static on the clothing.
2,Not sure of product effects,"I have been using over a month, every load, but still not sure if this product actually doing something or not. It is not really cutting drying time neither."
4,Works,"They like prickly balls and much heavier than tennis balls. They are odorless, and depending on your preference, you might miss the pleasant smell of your favorite dryer sheets. They do work. It makes the clothes fluffy and also lessen the static without using any chemicals.But if you use it with a little load, it sounds as if somebody put a pair of sneakers in the dryer."
1,Damages fabric. Avoid.,"I was keen on trying out dryer balls to do away with the chemicals of dryer sheets. It seems as though the balls do manage to fluff up the clothes due to the mechanical action. I actually used a different brand than this one - one with some patches meant to reduce static. The static reduction seemed to work too, since there was none on the clothes.The claims of reducing drying time, didn't seem to bear out. Clothes seemed to take the same amount of time to dry.I had to discontinue using this once I discovered that it damaged flannel sheets. The sheets were left with the flannel bunched into bumps rather than the soft feel that it had before. This is obviously due to the mechanical beating that the sheets gave it. I should have realized that the mechanical action will damage fabric.I suggest avoiding this product and sticking with dryer sheets."
1,Poor Quality and causes a lot of static,"I read that someone needed 6 for large loads so I bought 6 of them. After a month, I only have two left. All of the others split in two. Also, I bought them to help dewrinkle my husband's khaki pants. They did an okay job with this but they caused so much static that I have to use two dryer sheets with them. They are loud at first but as they are in the dryer and warm up they are not as loud. I was really disappointed with the quality."
1,Cheap imitation.,"Cheap imitation, static did not get reduced, and the ball split in half after a few loads."
1,Destroys your clothes,"I loved these things....at first. After several weeks of use, a lot of our bath towels and shirts started fraying around the edges. Before I tossed out the ruined items, I cut off the frayed bits and ran them through several cycles without the balls and guess what? No more fraying. These things will ruin your clothes. Not immediately, but they will tear at the fabric and one day you'll be pulling things out of the dryer and wonder why you bought these things. Great idea, but only for the sturdiest of materials... and then only if there are no weak or damaged areas.Do not bother buying."
2,ok,"Doesn't reduce static cling- actually makes it worse. But does make clothes pretty soft. Still, you need to use dryer sheets for the static (which irritates skin) so not much point buying these."
1,Use Tennis Balls Instead,These work as long as you dry no clothes with a coarse weave. They may destroy them. I have now been using 3 tennis balls instead for the last couple of years. They work!
5,Dryer Balls,"I purchased these dryer balls for my mom. She had 2 but after a long time, one was coming apart so needed a replacement. Actually, we had given her the first set of dryer balls because they were too noisy for us. Her Washer and dryer is further from the living area so she didn't hear them."
1,Made of Hard Plastic - LOUD in the Dryer!,"Purchased these as they resembled some we had purchased in the past. I wasn't sure of the original brand we bought so I thought these might be it. I was unfortunately wrong. Our old dryer balls were made of a softer plastic so they didn't bang around in the drum of the dryer. These however are made from a harder plastic and are very loud in the dryer, especially if you are running a small load.I discovered that our old dryer balls, the ones we really liked, were Nellie brand. I order an additional four of these through Amazon and am eagerly awaiting their delivery. My advice is to purchase Nellie's even if they are little more expensive than these."
1,fell apart in less than a month,"These are not worth the money or shipping. Aften a few uses, the spines starting breaking off and in less than a month several had totally fallen apart."
1,"Dryer Balls great for pets, not for clothes","Length:: 1:36 MinsThis is one of many As Seen On TV video product reviews you can see for yourself, for free, at [...]."
2,Broke after a few months,"These are ok. A friend highly recommended them but I didn't see too much of a difference. Also, after 6 months of occasional use, one of them ripped."
4,Would buy again...,"Pros: These work pretty well. They are free of extra chemicals (hooray for the environment), and they'll pay for themselves after many uses.Cons: After a year's use in a 3-person family, some of my clothes are starting to retain static, but it has only happened occasionally. They also tend to be a bit noisy, as to be expected. Might discolor slightly after awhile, but doesn't affect functionality.Final thought: Decent product, decent price, would buy again."
1,They don't last and are so-so in function,"In their advertising, the distributor claims that these balls last for years. One of mine broke into pieces after a few months of light use. Don't waste your money. I'm especially disappointed because my son is very sensitive to any fabric softeners so I cannot use them or any sort of dryer sheet. The manufacturer refused a replacement (rather use dryer sheets, but I can't!) or refund without sending proof of purchase, which of course I didn't have any more. I expected them to last for years, as advertised. I was willing to send the broken ball, but that wasn't enough ""proof of purchase."" Ridiculous and a rip-off.Beyond the issue of durability, they are certainly a poor substitute for fabric softeners and dryer sheets. I never noticed a reduction in dry time, either."
4,Fantastic - if you buy six.,"We have found that these work very, very well - but we got six of them for our large-capacity dryer. I truly don't miss liquid or sheet softeners at all. Perhaps you could get by with four, but sometimes one or two will ""go rogue"" and wander down a shirt sleeve, and with only four that wouldn't leave you with much. I would have given it five stars, but did not because the way it's packaged (two in a pkg.) would leave you to believe two were enough, and that's not true."
3,work fine,"These work fine, but you need to have 6 of them like the other reviews said. They work a lot better that way."
1,Don't waste your money,These are worthless. They don't improve the softness of your clothes and they certainly don't decrease the drying time. I've tried them with small loads and large loads and have found absolutely no benefit.
1,really did not help that much,"I purchased these dryer max balls to see if it would help with drying my clothes faster.I don't think it has helped at all.Also my large sheets/blankets keep wadding up into a ball in the dryer.I have tried everything.According to the info I watched,these items would help keep items from wadding up and make items from getting static cling. All wrong.So I wasted a bunch of bunks for something that did not work."
4,Dryer Balls VS. Fabric Softener and Dryer Sheets,"Why are these better than dryer sheets and fabric softener? Because dryer sheets and fabric softener are evil. If you're allergic or sensitive, these are a great resolution.I can think of three cons, but they're not really ""bad"":- Small loads means that the balls bounce around, making some noise. The noise level is less annoying than, say, drying a pair of sneakers.- Larger loads require more balls to ensure everything in the dryer is reached.- Once they are done drying, you might have to search for them if they get caught in pillow cases and such.On the up side:- Great for sensitive or allergic skin.- Great for saving money.- Cats like them."
3,"They work, but you need more than two.","These things are good in theory, but you need more than 2 to be effective for a normal sized load of laundry. We purchased two initially and didn't really notice any difference in drying time (our loads consisted of a few pairs of jeans, t-shirts, socks, etc for two adults). Then we purchased four more for a total of six, and that definitely improved the drying time by a good ten minutes. These guys are also great static-reducers, as they separate the clothes gently throughout the cycle, breaking up the fabric-to-fabric friction that causes drying static. The balls are gentle enough that I use them for the delicate dry cycles with my lighter and more sensitive fabrics. Remove the items promptly when they're dry and the balls really help to eliminate wrinkles and cling. After buying the additional four balls, I don't have any complaints."
1,DO NOT USE THESE BALLS,"Do Not Use These. They will tear your clothes. My wife started putting these in the dryer and the next thing you know I had tiny dimples and tears in my expensive clothes. The spines on the balls get caught on clothes during the tumbling process and make small tears, ruining the clothes eventually.We thre them away and the problem went away."
2,After a while... they came apart,I used other brands of this type of dryer ball and this one did not do well. The nubbies on the ends fell off and the balls themselves cracked in half. Not to happy with my purchase as I suddenly found myself replacing for a different type of dryer ball.
4,I use them and like them,"I have used dryer balls for a while, I don't think they shorten the drying time but they do increase the softness off my clothing. I DO use Tide with Downy and notice a difference if I throw the balls in. Fluffier. My mom was helping out at my house and did few loads of laundry and noticed it too. She went home and bought some the very next day."
3,dryer balls,"I bought some Dryer Max dryer balls last year and was happy, but this time around they looked cheaply made- at least the packaging. They haven't fallen appart in the first month of use, so I am hoping that they are as good as those I got last year. Apparently you need about 6 of them in the load to really get the effect."
5,i love that this band exists,"i picked up this ep on a whim...well..i knew they were on hydrahead and that label rocks and im a label whore sometimes...well this ep kicks some serious bum...from the 1st to the last track you get well thought out heavy, passionate metal...one of my new favorites for sure.."
3,Poor sizing information,"The socks are very cute, however there was no link for a sizing chart and I made the assumption they were for adults. Bad assumption, they are definitely children's, or made for someone with VERY small feet."
5,"You should read the book, too","As usual, HollyWood spiced it for the screen, but the original book, and others about collies by Albert Payson Terhune, need no spicing. Lassie is still classic, but Lad is beleivable and more straightforward. Read the books that started the legend of Lad and you will be even more impressed. The dog's reaction to his mistress's (the master's wife) illness is truly a wonder in dog behavior. Also, if you are a dog lover and lover of dog stories, Jim Kjelgaard's Big Red, plus other stories about Irish Setters (Irish Red, Outlaw Red) are on a level with Lad. Maybe better. Read a Book! Then watch the movies."
2,Weak,"I'm a big fan of Terry Pratchett, but found this one to be a somewhat weak effort on his part. The book had its funny moments, but was far from TP's normal hilarity. Also, TP usually mixes in biting social commentary with his stories, but it never quite connects here. At times, he seems to be condemning war as a testosterone driven exercise, but then at other times he shies away from that, and the last chapter actually argues for war!No, this is just not a good book. If you are a fan of TPs, you will want to buy it, just to complete your collection. But, if you aren't a fan, you will find this to be a book, weak on humor and weak on social commentary - a cute story that goes from A to B without making a point."
3,A comfortable read with some chuckles,"A tiny nation is at war and girl dressed as a boy joins a mismatched regiment and ultimately wins the war.Like most later Diskworld novels Monstrous Regiment will be a quick read with some good chuckles and then fades from memory.The twists are predictable, the jokes are too, there's a lot of moralizing about the horrors of war but nothing more unpleasant than a bump on the head happens on camera.A good read for a long plane trip or dull weekend."
3,"It's Pratchett, so it's good, but it's not great","Unlike Jingo or other Pratchett novels that treat the topic of war, I found ""Monstrous Regiment"" to be disappointly ho-hum. The big novelistic conceit: almost all the characters turn out to be ________, gasp! was predictable from the beginning.The plot and the characterizations were passable, and I agree with another reviewer that the character of Lt. Blouse is true Discworld gem! Otherwise, I found this novel to be much flatter than I would have expected: not nearly as gripping as ""Night Watch,"" another Pratchett novel from a similar time period.On the other hand, even a humdrum Pratchett offering is still better than most anything else in fanasty (esp. humorous fantasy), so this novel is still a must-have for the Pratchett fan."
4,More than they say,"Other reviews say this book is not like the others.I did not find a few of his works funny but still great.This work is good,it's a fun read and hard to put down.I have read Pratchetts books at least 10 times each and find this one a good read."
3,Disapointment is on the horizon...,"Monstrous Regiment was pretty good, but quite a dissapointment compared to Pratchett's last few Discworld books. The story starts out well, get rather improbable, but still keeps it under the allowance of ""humor"". The story doesn't really go anywhere for a while, and atthe end of the book, he beats the theme to death, stretches it, burns it, and scatters it's ashes to the wind. in my opinion, he could have done a lot better.I would recomend you read it, if you already like Terry Pratchett...I just wouldn't recomend that you buy it (especially the nice, expensive, hardcover)If you haven't read Terry Pratchett, read something else first so you don't get biased by reading this one."
2,The least enjoyable Discworld novel yet,"I've read, if not all the Discworld novels, then at least 90% of them. This is the least enjoyable yet. Not because it's about the folly of war, or the hazards of stereotyping, but because it just isn't funny. Something's missing here. It reads like a lesser author's failed attempt at emulating Mr. Pratchett."
2,Disappointing from a great author,"The challenging part of writing fantasy is making the unbelievable believable. Sadly, Terry Pratchett does not meet the challenge in ""Monstrous Regiment"". I have read and enjoyed previous Discworld stories, and was sorely disappointed in this book. I picked it up fully anticipating another great read, and kept anticipating the story to smooth out until the last few chapters. Unfortunately, every chapter got worse and it was with a heavy heart (and heavy eyelids) that I closed this book for the last time. The characters were only mildly interesting, and the many revelations about them were rather more grating than surprising. The overall theme of the book left me rolling my eyes and sighing, something I would not have expected from Terry Pratchett. My advice: if you are looking for a good fantasy novel, go back to some older Terry Pratchett, and leave this one on the shelf."
1,Oh no!,"Things are going down hill for TP. I was very disappointed. I wrote a review, and after a week it has not come up. Save your money folks. Get the paperback.....better yet, check it out from the library. If you liked TP's old stuff, you'll hate this. I did. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it was just dumb and predictable. I have every discworld novel in HB, and I pre-order them all as soon as Amazon lets me or notifies me. I'm a big fan.....but this book is probably his worst. Let's hope the next one is better."
3,"Not my favourite, but ok.","I think this was a nice book to read. I enjoyed the constant gender confusion, and the surprising strength of the regiment. Having the Times in there was a nice touch. Loved Vimes as usual."
5,Monstrous Regiment,"Probably my favorite book from the Discworld universe.The plot is gripping, the characters all have hidden depths, and I can only hope we will hear more about Polly and the others."
2,An abomination unto Nuggan,"You would expect in a series of over 30 novels for the quality to vary, and Terry Pratchett has produced both some gems in his Discworld series and some middling efforts. Regardless, they have all been marked by his inexhaustible humour and inventiveness. However, 'Monstrous Regiment' feels like it comes from another writer, a lump of leaden prose and tedious narration that offers practically nothing of interest or humour.The small nation of Borogravia is plagued by constant warfare and an oppressive religion. A young woman named Polly out of desperation joins the army in the guise of a man, and hilarity fails to ensue. The regiment plods towards the battle, revealing the same plot twist every chapter (which even the title of the book telegraphs for those who know the reference) and some banal reflections on the futility of war and sexual stereotyping. What it fails to reveal is anything to laugh or care about.Read any other Discworld novel before this one."
2,Good start - lame finish,"This book comes in at about 400 paperback pages... which was big for a discworld novel at the time.The book starts off great, and proceeds in typical Pratchett style until about page 240... then, things go downhill quickly. The fun/fast read is over, and it becomes a struggle to even finish the book.I recommend GOING POSTAL instead, if you want a good example of a big/latter day book from the discworld series."
5,Monstrously Hilarious!,"This is the first Terry Pratchett book I've ever read and If the rest of his stories are as imaginatively funny as this one I'll soon be a life long fan...Monstrous Regiment is about a barmaid named Polly who lives in Borogravia where the proud people war with anyone and everyone around them. Polly chops off her hair, pulls on some trousers and signs up to be a soldier in the Borogravian army to track down her brother and bring him back home.Her journey takes her on a wonderful adventure filled with vampires, werewolves, Igors and trolls. You'll be surprised and delighted by her discoveries along the way and grinning like a fool the whole way through...Couldn't for the life of me put this book down..."
4,Pratchett at his best,"A book I couldn't put down; every page makes you laugh out loud. The story and characters are simply wondrous, with plenty of hilarious observations an events that only Terry Pratchett could create. Top stuff."
2,Not one of Pratchett's best.,"I am a very big fan of Terry Pratchett's books, most of which are sidesplittingly funny while including effective satire/commentary on society. When Pratchett is on, his books are great. Unfortunatly he seems to have emphasized theme more than humor and storyline in this book. It's still ok, but it's defintly not going to be anywhere near the top of a list of his best books. It reads similarly to his book Pyramids, so if you liked or disliked that one you'll probobly feel the same about Monstrous Regiment."
2,Just Not The Same,"I won't go into too much detail, since there are already so many similar reviews here. I just have to say, I am a massive Pratchett fan. I have read nearly every book in the Discworld series, and I have loved them all, always found something clever, insightful in them...until this book. Monstrous Regiment was like Pratchett Lite...all the footnotes and none of the heart. I felt as if I were reading a book by someone who was trying desprately to emulate Pratchett, but simply didn't have the skill. So much low-brow humor, predictable plot points, and nothing original. Pratchett has covered war issues, gender issues and equality, in books infinitely better than this. This is the first time a Discworld book failed to make me laugh out loud. And Vimes and Angua's little cameos did nothing to improve the situation. I truly hope that this book is not an indicator of what's to come, but if it is, at least I still have every book that came before this to fall back on."
3,not my favorite terry pratchett,"I love everything Terry Pratchett, but Monstrous Regiment isn't his best effort. If you haven't read Terry Pratchett before I recommend one of his other books first - I like reading them in order of publication anyway although it's not necessary. If you're an old fan, you'll like it (and maybe even better than I did)."
5,The army,"This book starts about a young lady trying to find her brother, and goining the army. The book is well written, shows the futility of war, plus the other suides of it, glory, doing what needs to be done etc. It also handles some other areas well such as desrimination against women ( after readibng the book most of the cvharcters are women). And some of the struggle faced by women in this world. Not just the disc world. I would reccomend this book to any in the military, as it shows good command structure and control of troops well, also is is a well presented book which is a good read."
2,Downer,This book is a downer. It is too based in the bad parts of real life for a disc world novel. It is not a fun read or that interesting a read either. Go back and read the other novels. Even the ones with DEATH as the central character weren't as gloomy as this book.
1,waste of time and money,"I am a huge Pratchett fan. I have loved every one of his books - except this one.I stopped reading it half way through. It was not funny, I loathe the characters, and I do not care what happens to them.No that is not accurate. I do care what happens to them. I would like them to be ridden down by the prince's cavalry and buried in battle field mud."
2,Be Careful if you want the Book and not the Adapted Play,"I thought I was ordering the book and this ain't it! This is the 118 page script for a play adapted by Stephen Briggs from Terry Pratchett's book of the same name. Amazon.com's search engine thinks they are the same and now I must reorder the book.It is acceptable as a play, but not when you are expecting a lengthy period of hilarious reading."
5,Great price exceeded expectations,"very good cage, easy to assemble and most of all extremely easy to clean and maintain. i highly recommend this aviary cage its an excellent value."
2,It passed the time,"Ants living in some plants delivered to an office building start growing and attacking the people in the building. Luckily it's a Saturday so not many people are in the building (budget reasons?) We've got newspaper editor Stella Stevens and her suffering assistant Siri Baruc, and a few others.This low budget film has a couple of scenes that are really bad but overlall, it's your average low budget giant insect movie. The story is standard stuff, not very inspired. Not a very good movie but not all bad. It's watchable but not really as entertaining as some other movies of its types and not worth spending too much money on."
1,Agreeing fully with the comments from the reviewer b4 me,I totally agree that we can feel conned this way. I bought another book also with a different cover and ISBN but the contents are the SAME! This is unacceptable. We who buy from the web will never have the chance to look at the contents before buying and we rely heavily on the cover and descriptions!
5,Great Resource,This is a great parchment craft book. I love the photo examples of techniques. Easy to go by.
2,A disappointment,"The steam died within a week of using it (have to manually spray the clothes), and the cleaning feature is useless. It's a utile iron, I suppose, but still rather a disappointment. Spend the extra $$$ and get a good one."
2,"Wanted to like it, but not so much","It's a fine idea, but sluggish to play, and my biggest beef is probably not it's fault due to its age - graphics options. No way to do widescreen in this or Ahriman's Gift, though you can in King of Kings.I prefer Rise of Nations, and even Warcraft 3 or Dawn of War to this."
3,Too Thin,"Excellent graduations, great machinists ruler, but way too thin. Will be ordering a thicker version asap, this will probably be bent before it gets here!"
1,Coil seat not sufficient.,"If the lower part of your front strut mounts aren't broken, then I suggest reusing the old part. The upper coil seat/insulator that comes with this kit is a joke (i.e., that rubber ring you see in the stock picture). The insulator will allow the spring to rub into the metal mounts and is no where near sufficient to protect your springs or prevent metal-on-metal noise that will follow. I suggest using the toyota OEM rubber insulator that will wrap the upper half of your springs. Those OEM insulators are a beast and will last 10-20+ years."
3,It is not a warm hat! Not for winter!,I purchased this hat when the temperature outside started to go below 50 degree mark thinking that now i can dress my son not only in style but also warmly... I was immediately dissapointed when i took the hat out of the box: the hat is made out of two layers of cotton with a thin layer of a fake fur surrounding it! And even though it is cute it is not worth the money it is sold for! $5 would be a good price for it!
3,not all that great,"I bought this book because my algorithms class instructor recommended it. But after having it for awhile now I really do not use it as much as websites like cplusplus.com , also this book is written for programmers who already have a very firm grasp of c++ so if you are not already pretty experienced with c++ this book will be very hard to follow."
4,"Not the best book for beginners, but makes a good reference","The first third of this book contains an thorough explanation of everything C++. Grammar, semantics, constructs, namespaces, it pretty much covers everything. On the downside, it pretty much just jumps right into the structure of the language. This works for me, being moderately experienced with C/C++ and several other languages, but it would be downright confusing to a beginner. I know that this book isn't meant for beginners, but other ""In a Nutshell"" books are appropriate for people with little to no experience in the topic. This is not one of those books. The other two thirds of the book is a comprehensive printed reference to the entire C++ standard library. This is extremely helpful to anyone who does serious programming."
4,Concise and precise,The book has a concise material and precise terminology which is important for C++ references. The layout is logical and conducive to fast scanning and refreshing.
5,Not for beginners; great as a reference,"This is definitely not a book for beginners. However, this makes a great reference for experienced C++ programmers. I find myself going to it much more often thanThe C++ Programming Language: Special Editionbecause it is much more succinct, yet comprehensive. I only break out Stroustrup when the compiler error messages get really hairy :-)Hopefully there will be an update for the upcoming new C++-0x standard."
4,"Moody, magnificent","This is a great find for any Van der graaf or Peter Hammill fan. The disc contains a live recording from 1975 of the band performing the entire Godbluff album plus two songs from a Belgian TV appearance in 1971( theme one and a plague of lighthouse keepers).Th 1975 footage is fairly poorly shot, mostly close ups of either Peter Hammill or David Jackson and some wide shots of Guy Evans. Hugh Banton is almost nowhere to be seen. In all this is fairly typical of the period and for fans of the band is well worth owning.The two numbers from 1971 are another thing altogether. The director has tried to interpret the music ( Lighthouse keepers ) visually and has done a great job.This is a moody and magnificent recording of a great band.The last two tracks really left me wanting more.The sound quality of both gigs is great and I highly recommend this disc to fans of the band or of prog rock in general."
3,Best VDGG DVD,"Well, there are just 2 DVDs with VDGG , and this is THE ONE you have to have it. The performance of VDGG is very good, even though the sound and video quality is somehow just OK, about 3 stars from 5.As a fan of VDGG since more than 20 years ago, this was a must for me...Enjoy it!!"
5,The Joy of (Dark) Chocolate,"Julie Pech has compiled an informative, enjoyable and useful book on the history of dark chocolate and its medicinal purposes. Prescriptions for ailments from anemia to stress all have chocolate as their base. What a way to get well without side effects! Don't skip the sections on how to buy and eat chocolate. I was amazed at what I didn't know and what I've been missing out on. Recipes, resources and recommendations all make The Chocolate Therapist: Chocolate Remedies for a World of Ailments the perfect gift to include with each and every box of the dark delectable fruit (yes, chocolate is in the fruit family) you give from now on."
2,Meh...,"It was interesting to read about the history of chocolate but, I quickly lost interest. $7.99 for some author to tell me to eat more chocolate?! (I already do that) waste of money!!"
1,A little disappointed,"I was looking for a book with information about which wine would pair with which chocolate flavor, it had nothing about that so for that reason I am only giving it one star."
1,She is biased because she sells chocolate,"I agree with the other 1 star reviewer. And she sells chocolate from her website, that is from a network marketing company. I don't trust this to be unbiased information. Chocolate is loaded with fat and sugar. It's hardly health food. It does have some benefits but that doesn't make it good for you. You will gain weight if you eat it on a reular basis. There is no pricing information on her website, which is odd for a commodity like chocolate. So I'm guessing it's priced higher than the market value. I asked her for pricing and she sent me a link which was bad. I'm still waiting for price information from her. She seems to be evading me on the price. But how am I supposed to order it then? All these factors combined I wouldn't trust anything in the book to be objective."
5,Very cute book!,"I bought this book for a 3rd grader for a little Valentine's Day gift and it was great. The story is cute and she already knew the song, so she was reading/singing right along. Very catchy with funny little verses! We had a good time reading it together. Highly recommend!"
5,Adorable!,Fun and adventurous book to read to kids at Valentines. A little bit of playfulness and exploration make it a hit with boys and girls!
3,"Good sound, lack of inspiration","I own quite a few recordings of Branderburg concertos (Suzuki, Saval, Boston Baroque, Orchestra of the Age of enlightment, and more...).I bought this CD after listening to it in the store for one reason, the trumpet solo in the 2nd concerto is somewhat unique. The sound is very bright, the player is a true virtuoso, and he plays with ease and with comfort. I can't say that I am particulary inspired, but I do appreciate such skill; and even though I found this CD as a whole mediocre, I more often than not come back to it when I miss the 2nd concerto.For the price its not bad as a secondary recording; however, if this is your first purchase of this work, I highly recommended the names I mentioned above instead."
5,Dance Dance Dance!!!,"Divine is the Queen of Camp and this Collection shows us why, All the tracks are brilliant. The only complaint I have is that it is missing Walk like a Man & Think Your a Man. My opinion is that two of the three Native Love Mixes could have been left off and replaced with these other two songs. Highly Dancable and full of FUN AND ENERGY. There will NEVER be another Divine"
5,"Cool, Quiet and Reliable!","The biggest killer of hard drives is heat. If there is no air flow around the drive, the drive risks certain failure. That said, I have 2 of these running 24/7 in a home-theater PC in a raid-0 array. They are fast and quiet. They have been running continuously for over a year, and no hiccups. 160GB is small by today's standards, but the beauty of this design is that the drive is spinning just one single platter. If you were to go to the 320 GB or larger drive, then you will have multiple platters spinning inside the enclosure, resulting in higher heat and noise."
1,Replaced 3 in a year. .,"I had 3 die in the span of one calendar year. As a teacher, all I do is internet, word processing, Powerpoints and download a little music here & there. Yes, the hard drives were replaced by WD under warranty, but I spent $500 in PC repairs & data recovery in 2007. WD sends you a reconditioned hard drive and not a new one. I will never buy WD again and their QC department should be ashamed of themselves. I recommend Seagate."
4,WD 160GB,It worked from day 1 and more than 3 years later has not skipped a beat. Bought 2 of these for a server in a RAID setup and still going without any glitches without any shutdowns either
4,Compatibility with Cox DVR,Western Digital is my preferred HD but this model and probably most others are not compatible with Cox Cable DVR. This is probably not WD fault but it is a consideration. I will update if I can contact the manufacturer of cable box. Cox is totally unwilling to help. I wish I could rate Cox here instead of Wester Digital.
1,Misrepresented,"Ordered two WD 160GB SATA HDDs and received two packages MARKED as such but containing 80GB HDDs. Too bad I didn't notice until it came time to install the drives.Something is seriously wrong with Amazon's vendor(s) when it comes to HDDs. I previously purchased 15 Seagate 80GB IDE HDDs and roughly 50% of the lot actually worked. Of course it was way too late to return them.In both cases, I ordered new drives, not refurbished.Unfortunately I'm concluding that Amazon Electronics is like Walmart Electronics; an oxymoron."
3,Great Product,"This product comes without cables, but for the price this is truely a great product, works well for me."
5,Excellent,Very fast high speed drive. I reccommend it to all CPU users who need to upgrade there exsisting drives. This drve is also reliable.
5,Ol Reliable,"My favorite Hard Drive. I got one of these in all four systems I own. Cheap and reliable. Not a lot of storage space, but I don't need a lot. One in a HTPC, one in each of my gaming PCs and one in my voice communication server PC."
3,WESTERN DIGITAL,LOVE THEIR PRODUCTS BUT THIS DID NOT FIT MY OLD COMPUTER!! WILL TRY AGAIN LATER AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS!! LOL
5,No disappointments,"This is a good fast hard drive that comes brand new. Not so easy to find these anymore. I upgraded from my original 10 year old Maxtor 60 GB to this WD 160 GB for my Windows XP Pro system drive. My Maxtor was an excellent fast drive, which I have now installed in a Windows 98SE machine as a data drive, and this replacement Western Digital, is just as fast and even quieter."
5,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"This is one of the best sudoku puzzle books available, in that there are SO MANY puzzles for the price. The New York Post is frequently credited with bringing the sudoku craze to the U.S. (Thanks a lot, guys, there goes our the lovely breakfast conversations we used to have....) and they've released a worthwhile gem here."
3,neo-prog gem,"This is an excellently executed album, although the Fates and Rush resemblance is a little too obvious in places. The new singer is better than the guy from Steps, but his melodies tend to become monotonous as he tries to work over the insane, assymetric rythm shifts that characterize this CD. As is the case with many bands of this ilk (ie, Watchtower), they need to learn to calm down in places and give the singer some room to work. That's not to say that this isn't a good album--just that the vocals suffer because the band is so hellbent on being extremely complex all the time. The musicianship is top notch, and the singer is really good--he's just in a tight spot. If you're into Fates or Rush, or even to a lesser extent the Police, this album should interest you."
2,Not what I expected from the reviews,"I bought this CD based on the numerous 5 star reviews I read here. All I can say is, it didn't strike me the way it struck those other reviewers. I enjoy Rush, Fates Warning and Queensryche - as so many reviewers drew parallels to these bands. Are there similarities - yes, but I'll take the originals over Sieges Even pretty much any day.There's talent here - no question about the musicianship of the members of this band, but for the song construction - it wanders and is littered with 'noodling' and constant tempo and key changes that after a while, just flat out became irritating. It seemed that just when a song began to coalesce, some needless key change, or irritating noodle would mess the composition up. I got sick of it. It seemed that there were constant changes just for that reason - no intrinsic value at all.Quite frankly, if you want to buy this CD, I'll be selling mine on Amazon Marketplace pretty soon - cheap -.This CD was just plain irritating."
4,Good PG-13 fun,"Whether you'll like Slices depends, I think, on the kind of horror you're looking for. This isn't groundbreaking horror, or unrated extreme stuff. Slices reminds me of Creepshow, or TV series like Tales from the Darkside and Tales from the Crypt. There's minimal gore and violence and some nice plot twists. The acting is solid, as are the production values. If you liked Creepshow, you'll probably like Slices."
4,"Pricey, but cost-effective","For five years, I have been using my Sony VPL-ES2 LCD portable projector with my laptop (used for movies, slideshows, Powerpoint presentations in both home & business settings). When the lamp started to burn out this summer (the last movie I watched had no reds, so the action was definitely on the 'greenish blue' side!) I was appalled to discover that the replacement cost for the Sony lamp was well over $340 (a third of the cost of the unit). However, now that I have it working again (easy to reinstall), I am estimating the cost of usage at about 50 cents per hour, a bargain for such a highly portable solution for wide-screen projection. Amazon delivered the lamp quickly, impeccably and securely packaged considering its fragility."
4,Should be Required for all teachers,Teachers should be required viewing for all teachers. I work in higher ed but I have worked in secondary and have seen the things in this movie happen sure it is exaggerated but that is what makes the point.The teacher that does not want to deal with the students and gives handouts everyday. I have seen this teacher before even in higher education.The crazy guy - I would love to have a teacher like this. He made learning fun.Then the guy that cares (Nolte) He realized he was part of the problem and set out to change.I could see myself in these characters: I was burned out and did not really care then after summer break this year I am back.Get a copy and watch it.
3,Talk About BLATANT,"If ever there was an occurrence of wholly, fully, completely gratuitous and absolutely unnecessary nudity in a movie, it happens at the end of this one."
3,great extras,"The ""stars"" in this film are the extras, especially the tall guy of the two who come to take away the ""crazy"" substitute. Does anyone know his name? Has he appeared in anything else?"
3,"Satire, comedy, or drama? Doesn't matter, it's mediocre","This is one of those movies that tries so damned hard to be everything to everybody, that it succeeds in none of its ambitions. It veers back and forth between being a typical 1980's teen comedy (which is how it was marketed where I lived), a grim drama, and at times a biting satire. The result was an ill-defined effort that disappointed nearly everybody (it sank like a rock at the box office as I recall). The utterly pointless & gratuitous nude scene at the end was so calculated that I cannot imagine that anyone who saw it could have taken this movie's pretensions to relevance seriously after that.This is not a memorably bad movie in any sense, but instead is thoroughly mediocre. I am amazed that I remember ever seeing it at all."
4,Allstar cast ! Great 80' s Movie,A story about High School trials and tribulation from sex.drugs.abortion and a lawsuit over former student passing high school just to get him through the system. Starring a unknown Morgan Freeman way before Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby. Also Nick Nolte (48 Hours) Ralph Machio(Karate Kid).Jo Beth Williams. Crispin Glover (Back to the Future)Judd Hirsch (Taxi) Richard Mulligan (Soap)Laura Dern (Mask) A MUST FOR 80's BUFFS!
2,Just doesn't ring true,"Muddled, superficial satire of high school politics feels dated already. Nick Nolte (who is OK here) is a yet another Hollywood educator who feels he can make a difference in the school as well as in one boy's life, who graduated as an illiterate. As a comedy is can pass. But as a drama it just falls apart, too often taking the easy way out and leaving mixed feelings at the end. Quite harmless, though Mulligan has a funny role as an escapee from a mental home who is mistaken for a teacher!"
4,Teachers,This was a great movie with an awesome soundtrack from the eighties! Good luck finding the soundtrack though. Nick Nolte as a teacher! Awesome!
4,Teachers the 1984 movie,"Not the best movie but a great cast. Filmed in Columbus, Ohio and the extras were all locals and great use of a no-longer used school that is now a nationally known museum."
5,Teachers,"Being a teacher myself, I have always loved this movie and wanted to switch over from VHS to DVD. To me this is a classic to have and watch. The school psychologist in the movie acts and losses it just like the one we had in my building; hope that is not indicative of the position and mindset!lol"
5,Traxxas Exhaust,"Was the Part I Needed, fast shipping , good price. Very Satisfied.Fit the Traxxas Nitro Sport as needed. Was a slight differance but worked as should"
3,"sassy scent, but poorly manufactured","I have been using Bowling Green eau de cologne for decades and always get compliments . Unfortunately, unlike the eau de cologne, which I still use, this product is poorly constructed, it does not extend smoothly, dries quickly into a shrunk stub even with the lid on. I went back to L'Occitant which is on the par scentwise and last forever."
2,Boring portrayal of an exciting woman,"Way too much attention to ""social history"" and ""cultural commentary"" and not enough information on Mae West. It was if the author felt she had to use every bit of historical background she had found - little of which served to move the book forward. I did not feel I got to know Mae West nearly as well as I did the times she was living in - which was not what I wanted from a Mae West biography."
2,ZZZZZzzzzzzzz,I love Mae West but this book bombed. It is informative but so much that it's boring. I never finished it. It has some great photos and if you're doing a term paper on her it's wonderful.
2,Past the Bleachers,"I have just started reading Past the Bleachers and he has used ""slang"" to describe what he and his wife have been doing in order to get pregnant. I really thought it was uncalled for and was greatly diappointed. But on a lighter note, I just finished Hangman and that was a four star. But, Trans-Sister Radio, was definitely a five star!!"
2,Please enter a title for your review,"With so many bands making a living off playing disposable, mediocre pop music the listener forgets minutes after hearing it, why would anyone want to go out of their way and labor over writing something memorable? For the members of the International Drive there really isn't much of a choice. The band excels at crafting generic emo pop-rock fueled by a preoccupation with what other bands are writing and playing. Though the road to releasing this EP may have been an arduous one, Finish What You Started is a monument to what it means to cater to a fickle industry's flavor of the month and have the end result turn out exactly as it should; leaving you as another face in the crowd hoping to one day open for Fall Out Boy. Relentlessly mid-tempo and averagely catchy, Finish What You Started is unlikely to inspire a second listen. Recommended if you like: mediocre pop music with flamboyantly effemimate sensibilities."
4,Nice dish towels.,"I collect pig things, so these fit right in. I would prefer them to be a bit softer, but that will probably come with time and a few more washings."
5,Show-me the Stars,"Rising Stars and Ozark Constellations is a must to read. Author, Vicki Cox, is a talented free lancer who takes you on a journey through the Show-me state and stops to chat with the most interesting people. Their life styles, hobbies, unusual professions, and successes, connect and become shining stars of the Ozark Plateau. I'm proud to be one of those stars. Look for the Firecracker Lady on page 152. I'll be waiting for you!"
5,"Lovely illustrations, cute story, best for Ages 3-5","Leo Lionni's illustrations are lovely, the story is cute and relatively short.Another reviewer described the storyline very accurately, so I would just note that the book has relatively short/small sentences per page, but the text still might be a bit long for an impatient or active 2 year old, esp. if they are too young to know that calling an alligator a ""chicken"" is meant to be humor. I'd say ideal for Ages 3-5."
4,A different sound,"This album is different than previous albums by Tempest. Yes there are a couple of songs with a heavy metal sound BUT they are great songs. Listen to Dance of the Sand Witches and the Battlea Mountain Breakdown. Todd Ewveans has done a greqat job on guitar. The fiddler is not as good as Michael was and is no lo0nger with the band and haas been replaced by Susan who, while not a Michael Mullen yet has great promise in replacing him. (Just saw the band tonight as a matter of fact). This band can play rock with the best of them. The mixing on this album was poor and I remixed it a bit on my own computer and it drastically improved some of the songs."
3,Delivery date disappointment - product excellent!,The book ordered was NOT delivered within the specified time period. It was ONLY delivered AFTER I had requested an explanation and then it was apologetically sent priority mail. It arrived in excellent condition but I was very displeased with the fact that the sender needed a reminder to check the status!! What if I hadn't contacted the sender?? Would the item NOT have been forthcoming???
3,Holy Longing,"The first part of this book is excellent and well worth reading. The idea of spirituality being about what we chose to do with our life energy is intriguing and enlightening and consciousness expanding. After that, however, the book goes downhill and becomes a series of injunctions and imperatives and exhortations, all based on the author's ideas of what's right. What could have been an enriching exploration turned into just another dogmatic approach to religion."
1,'The Holy Longing',"As I found this book to be quite liberal and ""cafeterial Catholic"" in presentation, I stopped reading it after page 94!!"
1,Don't read this book!!!,"Please for the sake of Christian spirituality, do not read this book! It compromises everything that is Christian and minimizes the entire doctrine of God creating human beings male and female."
3,heavy,"I like some of his ideas, but he has a tendency to repeat the same thought over and over. It is not exactly what I was looking for, but certainly a thoughtful approach to the teachings of Christ."
5,Christian spirituality,Rolheiser writes with incredible clarity about a topic which can be confusing and difficult to understand. I would recommend this book highly to any individual struggling to understand either Christian spirituality or the demands of living a Christian life. Outstanding!!!
3,.Used book.,The book is great. It had some highlining in it but otherwise looked like new. I am always pleased with my selections.
5,Soal searching,"Has me hooked on Rolheiser's take on what truly is inside each of us; an ""energy and fire"" that needs to be quenched. Fr. Rolheiser offers many options on how to contain, release and express this ""fire within"", and at the same time knowing that it is the Spirit of God working within you. Read the book, I read it twice so far. You will be amazed at how you think after reading it."
3,A little LONG,"I think this book has changed my life. It is a wonderful book on spirituality and I was zipping along for the first 100 pages. I just finished the book and will need to reread it for a better understanding of what exactly I do with this new outlook on my spirituality. In book reviews, some people gave this book a 5 star, but I think is was a little redundent after awhile. I enjoyed the stories, the examples the author gave, but I think it could have been completed in 150 pages. the other 75-100 were fluff."
2,Longing for the book to be over!,This book is required reading for our High School religion class. I find the book to ramble on about the same thing for pages. The book has not helped my faith. Often I leave chapters feeling angry because I disagree with his opions. We are told the book is liberal...I hate to see conservative.
5,The Holy Longing,I am ready to listen to the audio book for a second time. I could easily relate to the author as he delved into the struggles of spirituality in one's faith life. I am going to have to listen to the Shattered Latern!
5,Best Book on Catholic Spirituality in 10 Years...,"Rolheiser does an amazing job of taking the reader on a journey of spirituality. He carefully crafted the book to help the reader understand the fundamentals of a solid Christian spirituality. Though clearly written from a Roman Catholic perspective, the writing and insight is so helpful that any Christian would benefit from it. This book will truly help one's reach expand his grasp spiritually.The man who recommended this to me is brilliant for recognizing it as the best book on Catholic spirituality he had read in the last ten years.This is the kind of book that starts great discussion groups and leads them to the formation of a community."
5,"Outstanding, penetrating, thoughtful book","It is difficult to put into words how wonderful this book is. I finished it today, and plan on turning back to page one to read it over again. Ronald Rolheiser put into words and concepts issues of spirituality and Christianity that deepened my understanding of where I am and where I need to be. His chapters on incarnation were very powerful; and, his last chapter, ""Sustaining Ourselves in the Spiritual Life"" gave a good (and empathetic) grounding on how to make these ideas relevant each day."
4,Jazz violin,I really like this album. I had never heard of this artist and bought the CD from s sale Amazon was having. I haven't heard a lot of jazz violin so I don't know if my opinion would mean much if you're looking for good jazz but I really enjoy this CD.
5,Brilliant,"An absolute stunner- each cut is wonderful and the mix is inspired. The Faure Pavane- always a lovely piece of classical music, but nothing extraordinary- rises to the heights in Ms Carter's deft hands- it is arguably my single favorite piece of recorded music in any genre, ever- simply amazing!"
1,Ouch!,I think this violin playing is not good. Not good. There are numerous other musicians and arrangers who can do it better.
1,Terrible sound from one of the most valuable instruments,The sound comes from the violin was really terrible. I couldn't believe it! It hurt my ears badly that I did not finish listening to the entire CD.I have listened to a couple of Ms. Carter's earlier CDs. They did not sound so badly. So I figure it might have to do with this particular piece of instrument. I don't know....Give it a try and find out for yourself.
5,Nice tool.,"If you do not use a plastic snapon cover, this is the thing you need. A thin protective film that prevents scratches and screen wear."
3,Shipping and compatibility,"This items was shipped 20 days after the order was placed.This item is advertised as compatible with LG PM325 however as packaged, the connecter does not insert all the way into the phone. There are no instructions included with the device. Fortunately, I figured out that there was a small plastic sleeve that could easily be removed from the part that fits into the phone to allow the connector to go all the way in.So far the device works fine."
3,power compatibility problems with PM-325,"I bought this with the slim travel charger, and both have the same problem. Previous reviewer didn't indicate that they had problems with it, so maybe I'm the problem. I'm a fairly savvy electronics user, and I don't see how I could be screwing up the process of -plug the charger into working DC jack, plug charger into phone-.Yes, as noted in previous review, I slipped the piece of plastic off, the charger plugs all the way into the phone.When the charger is only plugged into the DC jack in my car, the LED shows a steady green, but when the other end is plugged into my phone to charge it, the LED blinks red. I'm assuming that's a power issue."
4,Pretty friggin' good,"A friend of mine went to a concert and came back with this album, raving about this band, The Anniversary. He forgot his cd at my place, and out of curiosity, I decided to give it a spin. And, by the fourth track or so, I realized I was sitting there perplexed, my brow furrowed, á la Jack Black in ""High Fidelity,"" saying, ""This is good. This is really friggin' good."" So, the truth is, this cd is worth the twelve bucks, and if you're still unsure, find a friend who has it and just burn it. (Ain't technology grand?) The beats are a little poppy, and the vocals are weak at times, but the truth is, its a great cd for just light music to play when you're studying or something. This band has a lot of potential. It caught me by surprise, and perhaps it will catch you, too."
5,Wow can a CD get much better?,"I saw the anniversary live playing with TGUK, and then I didn't know who they were. After listening to them there I just had to get their album. For one they are a really good live band but this CD is OUTSTANDING!!! The 3 layers of vocals are just incredible and I really like the contribution from the keyboard. I am a huge emo/indie fan and I have to say this is one of the best cd's I have heard in quite a while. IF you are indecisive about buying it don't be because you will love it :)"
4,A good buy,It is all too easy to get in a rut. I feel this helps to keep your marriage strong. It is a good investment. I bought it as a gift because I had it myself.
2,"Unless you are uber religious, do not buy this book",I loved the 5 love languages but this was not helpful. Some concepts were interesting. WAYYYY too much religion for what is suppose to be a marriage guide. I have nothing against anyone's beliefs but it pretty much says God will fix your marital problems. So if your readers aren't Christians or religious? Are we screwed?I made it through 3/4 of the book and had to stop. It was rubbing me the wrong way.
4,Enjoyed reading,Good book. Very practical and easy to read. Numerous examples. I do not have a lot more to say about it except I would recommend it to others.
3,"A bit too much ""Jesus"" for me...","Short and sweet:I enjoyed the 5 love languages, and this book was tough for me. Way too much God, bible quotes and Jesus... hard for me to get through."
1,White Chocolate Mousse Calorie Control,"The testure is very light and that is good. The taste is very strong of artificial sweetner. This might be ok served over a dish of fresh berries. but alone the taste is lacking. I will not buy this flavor again. However, many of the other EDiet desserts are most excellent. I highly recommend the other Mousse desserts & flavors."
2,Does not fit my Titan,Purchased this based on a picture of the chevy in the add.I thought it would cover the front edge of my Titans hood.Hoping to hide chips with it and protect it from further damage.Only covered half of the desired space.Looks like a mini hood shield.
2,Damaged,"I purchased this seeing the raving reviews and felt an urge to buy. Today I got it in the mail, and found it damaged. Upon opening it, everything looked great. I found all of the contents in the box, except that the DVD was missing. That being the only thing that I wanted with the product, I am now finding myself disappointed with this ""new"" product. I am sure that most of these people got their box and enjoyed it, but i am not satisfied with the product."
1,terrible,"don't even give this one a second thought. different vocalist, the violinist is even worse than he was on one for the kids (thank god they got him some lessons before ocean avenue came out), just plain BAD in all respects."
1,WOW!!,"I listened to the online preview and it sucks, simply put. All the songs sound the same, if you dont believe me try it yourself...It just plain sucks"
5,DK Formula Brings Another Great Topic Introduction,"DK has a great formula for introducing topics to kids. Beautiful graphics, excellent layout and good summaries of important facts surrounding their topics.Such is the same for their Civil War book. For the child wanting (or needing) an introduction to the Civil War this book will serve well. The pictures draw the attention of the browser and the text gives a pretty good brief summary of the why, who and what for the reader.An excellent addition for your child's library."
4,Nice book but for children.,When I purchased this book I did not realize it was for children. It is avery good book for younger readers.
2,THE DEATH OF A FIRE TRUCK,"This time, we wanted to see just how much heat the Mega Bloks Fire Truck could take. The build was great. My son and I finished it in about two hours. We met the local volunteer fire department at a two alarmer, and I gotta say we were all a little disappointed. We parked the Mega Bloks Fire Truck right next to the curb in front of the fire. Even before we were able to get the hoses off, the truck turned into a liquid puddle of goo in the street. Glad we weren't depending soley on that truck to put out the fire. Someone might have died. We gave it four stars for education because it taught us all a valuable lesson. Never go into battle with a plastic fire truck."
1,It Sucks,This is the worst thing I have ever bought!! The Durability Is Terible And The Instructions Are Lame!!!!!Worst Toy I Have Ever Bought!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Go crazy,"They did not say that this fire truck has 1108 pieces, many many tiny pieces, that you have to put together to make this fire truck."
1,Where's the foam?,"This item is mis-represented and in my opinion falsely advertised, or they didn't send everything. It's advertised as foam 'filled', but I have yet to find it and the box is empty. It is so flimsy, I'm not sure how the head will stay up/ inflated. There was no foam filling included in the shipment. Stay clear away from this one. It looks great on line, but disappointing when you get it first hand."
1,disapointing,i AGREE WITH THE OTHER CUSTOMER THIS IS NO WHERE CLOSE TO WHATS PICTURES ITS HOLLOW AND FLIMSY AND ONE PEICE DOESNT LOOK REAL OR LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS
4,GOOD QUALITY!,I just christened my RODE NT2-A using this P48 Phantom power supply and believe me when i tell you it's working just fine.
3,"Ok fit, a little hard to install","Good deal, but I wish I would have spend a little more money. These did not fit my trailblazer like I hoped but they were the right price at the right time. Looked good, bad instructions, and final product was average. You pay what you get for and that was good enough for me."
1,knife,"The knife I purchased shows in the ad that the knife is made in the USA when I received this knife it was made in china, big difference you can buy this knife anywhere online for $22.00 very disappointed"
4,Let's go hunting!,My son-in-law was truly impressed with this spike knife. He can't wait to go deer hunting next season. The price was great too!Kathy K.
5,Golden Spike has Best Features,"I'm a big game hunter from Wyoming. This Schrade knife has the best shaped blade for all around use. I especially like its slightly upswept sharp tip that still has enough ""belly"" for skinning chores. I was skeptical about the Schrade assembly change from USA to China. But the quality of steel plus fit and finish details are flawless. In summary, this is a very good knife for the big game hunter."
5,Schrade Golden Spike knife,"This a beautiful hunting and utility knife. They keep escalating in price as they are no longer (?) made. It is a luxury looking, collectable knife.Proud to own it. Good old USA made !"
4,Good knife....unrelated to the Golden Spike site in Utah,"I bought this as a gift for my father, who lives in Utah. I personally didn't think it had anything to do with the Golden Spike historic site in Utah, but when I asked him how he liked it he mentioned over-and-over how it didn't say anything about the historic site on it or in the literature. That being said, if you're looking for a well built, handsome fixed-blade knife then this is a good deal. However, if you're looking for some kind of ""Golden Spike Commemorative"" then this is NOT for you."
1,Poor Steel Quality,I looked around for a reasonable skinner knife to use on a hunt out west. I can put a razor edge on all my knives but it is impossible with this knife because the steel is so soft and has poor heat treatment. As soon as I get it as sharp as possible I can try to cut things with it (even small things like paracord) and it will immediately start losing its edge. I cannot possibly see how you could make it through skinning a deer/elk. I am going to get something else of better quality like the Buck Pathfinder. Buck knives are always great.
5,Nice Addition to Cannonball Collection,"Cannonball Adderley is one of the all time greats of jazz. This was a wonderful variation of his normal style. It is classic Bossa Nova, and it is done with a delightful touch of one of the best."
5,Ensemble Singing at It's Finest,"According to the included notes with this CD, there are 20 members in this Toulouse based ""Choeur de Chambre les Elements."" You will have a hard time picking them out, as they sing as one voice. Clean, clear, beauitful singing at the highest level. The selections work very well as a set; you won't find a more beautiful and satisfying presentation of the Ave Verum by Faure."
1,It tastes like carrots.,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ER3EFC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgI don't have a baby, but I am on soft foods for a while after stomach surgery. I ordered some baby foods from Amazon and promptly found out why my babies never would eat baby food. This is supposedly sweet potatoes, but they found a way to remove all the earthy goodness. Before I added salt it tasted like nothing eaten by a human; with salt, it tasted like very mild carrots. I suppose I will eventually use it in baking, but frankly, if it's sweet potatoes I never want to meet the strain of sweet potatoes it came from."
1,My experience discs are defective,"Subsequent to reviewing the music you have a disc of plastic that is a product. Don't know about the music, I purchased 2 of this title separated by months from 2 different vendors and both do not play. They lockup by track 4, or never play.Seems Schematic makes a defective product. My other 600+ CD's play just fine."
3,Misleading title,"I found the book extremely easy to read. Parkhill talks more about the state of society and the world as a whole and the impact of media on the individual. Only 10 percent of the book is used to explaining his therapeutic methods, that is Regression therapy. I was realy hoping to find some good advise. You will find more knowledge and use in 'Time Line Therapy' by Tad James. The three stars are given for Parkhills dedication to changing the world we live in."
1,The title is very misleading,"The title is very misleading - very little is mentioned about cancer. 90 percent of the book is a soap box presentation of the personal political and religious views of Parkhill. He does touch on some hypnotherapy regarding the critical faculty/selective thinking theory; but, you would be much better off and go to the source in ""Hypnotherapy"" by Dave Elman (excellent choice). If you want to know about cancer try another excellent source in ""Getting Well Again"" by O. Carl Simonton, M.D. But if you want to listen to some soapbox stuff on today's society (I will say that I do agree with what he says, BUT, that is not why I bought his book - I thought it was a book relating to cancer and its healing), or be preached to on his concept of God and how dependant we are on him, then buy his book."
1,Did Not Ship Purchase Paid For,"I was emailed by Amazon, on August 22, 2009, saying the book that I paid for was shipped. On september, 14 2009, After four and a half weeks of waiting for my book, I tracked the purchase myself to find that it had never been shipped. Why wasn't I contacted emediately, so that I could order it again in time for my fall classes starting? CBC_books no longer had the used book that I ordered and paid for in August. I am now waiting for my check refund, although I paid with credit card. Still have not recieved my check. This is completely poor customer service.Thanks for nothing Amazon books and Cbb_books,Brad CappsUpdate: It has been six weeks since my above review. Now november 2, 2009. Still have not received my refund from Cbb_ books. They call themselves Cbb store on Amazon books."
3,Somewhat Good Condition,Book arrived a day early from what it was stated. I knew exactly that I was buying a Used book but I'm a bit disappointed because on the cover of the book it said VOILD. Looked as if someone stole it from somewhere or borrowed it from the library but never returned it. Can't remove the sticker because if I did it'd ruin the cover of the book to where it'll rip the book apart.Need this for English Class. It's alright for now....
4,Some interesting essays,"There are some interesting essays in this very academic volume. Morris Dickstein on the 'Complex Fate of the American Jewish Writer' Ruth Wisse on' The Yiddish and Hebrew Writers Head for Home' Also the essays by David Roskies and Michael Kramer are of value. Unfortunately there is an ugly political piece by Y. Laor, which downgrades the tone of the whole volume. The volume too does not touch upon the great bulk of vital new Jewish writers especially young religious writers."
5,Secondhand purchase,"Alright, these cd's have been my fuel for the last few days so I had to write a review.My brother hated this mix, so he sold it top me. I love this mix. The reson he hated it was he was wanting a really cool down chill out mix. This mix for me represents the early morning with your friends chilling after the club mix. 5am down time. So if that's the sort of chill album you want this is the ticket. Very smooth and yet very forward. Watch the sunrise with your mates before you crash."
1,Disappointment,"If you're looking for more songs like 'as the rush comes' you will be sorely disappointed. I was hoping for much better, seems like a bunch of bad 'B' sides."
2,A HUGE Mistake!,"Last week I bougt this cd because I thought it was actually Paul Oakenfold's music, not the music of various artists ""presented"" by Oak... I have never been so upset at a purchase.Almost every track has a whiny woman singing over some pretty repetitive beats. It feels like there this album was thrown together to keep up with the whole Chillout music craze. A few tracks such as Coldplay's God Put a Smile on your Face and Oakenfold's The Harder They Come were decent. However, overall the cds were not worth the money.Be warned!"
3,Wide angle lens,"This lens was a little too small for my camera and it caused vignetting in the corners of the photographs. Other then that, the photos were sharp and clear."
3,Just okay,"Being a huge fan of the ""chick lit"" genre, I was disappointed in this one. Many of the characters seemed one-dimensional and the banter between them was a little off at times. I had a hard time connecting past the surface on any of the characters, even the main one who dealt with some serious emotional situations at times. In all, a very light and fluffy read--it kept my attention, but just barely. There were several parts that were interesting enough to keep it from being a one star, but can't say I'd recommend it to any of my friends."
3,Light and Fluffy,"I read this on vacation at the beach with husband and kids in tow. If your looking for a light escape with not much content or character developement, this is the book for you. The book was ah...a cute story.... It did hold my attention,and was funny at times, but was too contrived towards the end. Not the best read."
5,Papillon a good example of human courage,"When I first read Papillon I was in school and I never found a book as good as this ever after. 'cause it's a lesson, a tale about hope and friendship, the whole story seems to put you there with Charriere that's the meaning of oral literature. his adventures, his scapes his sadness are an epopey of human strenght. and a lesson for living. Since it's begining, the trial then the fantastic scape from the hospital, the story of the money holders stored deep inside his body all this and His 13th years of adventures are filled with passion, love and truth. One book I recomend......of course Papillon. The greates story of freedom."
5,A truly amazing story of a phenomenal man!,"Even though I am only fourteen, I still wish to express my views on this. This is about the survival of one truly amazing man. The author of this book wrote its contents with such feeling, I got the impression that he placed himself in the bagne, and wrote from there. There is no explination for the feelings that crossed my mind, flipping page after page. It was a touching story of a brave man, who was wrongly accused, who fought against all odds, and won."
5,"Gripping book, wonderful movie","A book you can enjoy re-reading every few years. For those who enjoy the author's spirit, let me also recommend ""Alexander Dolgun's Story"" of an American in the Gulag"
2,Bad but maybe closer to pioneer jerky?,"Super thin and also hard and fibrous. It was in large sheets that you couldn't snack on. Didn't taste the teriyaki. Had a old beef taste. Threw it away. Maybe making it from one muscle is not the way to go? Needed a sharp knife really... Thought it was historically accurate to what the Indians had. Maybe that's what ""Western Cut"" means?"
2,Meh,"I'm a big jerky fan and saw the reviews for this Western Cut (which I've never tried before). This is NOT what I expected. I have to rip jagged pieces off the paper thin flat sheet of jerky and I can barely taste the spices considering this is supposed to be Cajun. Essentially I'm finding that this product for me is just ""something to chew"". I also ordered Buffalo Bill's Hot Short Shots which I am enjoying quite a bit more (although once again I would not consider them to be hot). I will consider trying other Buffalo Bill's products based on the Short Shots but I am very disappointed with the Western Cut Jerky. So much for trying new things..."
5,The Best,THis is some of the best beef jerky I have had in a long time. It has the best flavor of any beef jerky out on the market.
1,Terrible,"The ""slabs"" are thin sheets--like paper or card-stock. They are un-chewable--I had to cut them up with scissors to be able to eat them. They also taste bad--the teriyaki flavor was overpowering. I purchased several other products from this company, and was similarly disappointed in every case. Avoid."
1,don't buy this stuff,Buffalo Bills 18oz Original Western Cut Big Slab Beef Jerky (15 beef jerky slabs per bag)Buffalo Bills 18oz Original Western Cut Big Slab Beef Jerky (15 beef jerky slabs per bag)]]This beef jerky is the worst I ever had. My dog's treats are more appealing than this jerky was. Do yourself a favor and don't purchase this product.
2,not one of bb.jerky's best,"looking 4 good jerky I tried the big slab jerky & I didnt like it,too thin too tough.I Also tried the countrycut jerky and it was far better,very moist and tender.I am sure looking forward to trying all the countrycut flavors,I will be reordering soon. Although I didnt like the big slab jerky,the shipping was so fast I will be a return customer."
4,Excellent read,"Hughes has created an original PI, and his writing is like poetry. The Wrong Kind of Blood will not disappoint his growing fan base. It is full of humanity as well as a wicked sense of humor and is a true page-turner of a book. It is also written with style must writers fail to achieve in twice the number of pages."
4,Hieronymus Bosch He Ain't,"In fact, Ed Loy, the ""detective"" in this tome is a troubled man and not much of a sleuth. However I would still recommend this book. Declan Hughes is a good writer, the sort like Larry McMurtry that can write a lot of words about mostly nothing but you still want to read it. Less gifted writers have to fill their books with fantastic plots to keep the reader from surrendering. I found the 1st 50 or so pages really interesting with the Irish expressions I was not familiar with and the development of the characters. As I went on the author made the common mistake of having Loy do dumb things even though based on his school work many years before one would assume he is quite brilliant. That is the problem, a young man with grades good enough to get into Trinity College medical school wouldn't be stupid later in life. And he wouldn't be broke either. I'm hoping his future books will be better, the writing talent is there, the good ideas are there."
2,Not impressed,"Saw a rather disappointing play by this guy in Dublin. The program notes indicated that he'd branched out into mystery writing about a decade back, and that the play was his return to the theater. Figured I'd check out the mysteries to see if he was any better at that -- he's not."
4,Great Period Work,"I am not sure how I stumbled across this on my Kindle, but I am happy I did. A great read for anyone interested in Civil War period pieces. Read it!"
2,pak mei kung fu the forbidden art,"This is the only book in the world on this subject, I asume that there are training manuals in china however because of the nature of the art and the chinese reluctance for westerners to learn it there are no other books to compete against it. Therefore this book has no comparison.This book has minimal informative content,and has been bulked out using photographs. I would advise prospective buyers to look on the internet as there is a wealth of information to be found there."
2,"Would only recomend for the Pak Mei student,very little inf","The Pak Mei student may wish to purchase for the historical value of the pictures,but anyone else will most likely be disappointed.Very little written info. Poor quality photos. 1 star for the kung-fu student,2 stars for a Pak mei student,0 stars for everyone else"
1,I don't suggest this book.,"This book (is that what you call it?) is overpriced and contains very little information. The pictures look like poor quality photo-copies than actual pictures, AND to top it off it gives no discription of the form itself. Spend your money on a better book. This one is NO GOOD."
1,"If you want to waste your money, Go ahead buy it!",The one who have just given 5 stars for this book must also be the one who has the used book for sale. He want to get rid of the book and get some money back. This book is totally no good for either Pak Mei students or the others.
1,Don't buy it !!!,"The book contains lack infomation about this style. All pictures in this book are very fuzzy. If the author does not want to share his kung-fu to the public, please don't write the book. If the author want to write the book, please write the book which can show a little RESPECT to the audience. To anyone who want to make a review on this web site, Please make the true statements. Don't give the book credit just because you know or like the author. I bought this book first because I like to learn, and secondly because the previous reviewer gave it 5 stars and a wonderful review. I made my mistake, so I wish you don't have to make the same mistake as mine ..."
5,Dear and Glorious Physician,"The book was sent in record time and in excellent shape. I would recommend this seller to everyone! My book was ruined in a flood and I was worried that I could not replace it. Again, Amazon and this seller came through! TY"
4,I wish I could give it four and a half stars.,To appreciate it I had to really listen to it and allow my imagination to go. I felt the darkness of it; but I also felt there was a small amount of goodness in it conflicting or scurrying in the maze of evil. When I am not really listening to it the music seems to be good for only background music for maddening shows.This is my first Delerium CD; and I am not a big fan; but I am glad I bought this CD.My grand total in purchasing this CD (used) was $14.99; it was worth it. I would not buy it if it cost over 30 dollars. If you are going to spend over 30 dollars buy 'CCR volume one' (a compilation of CCR's best songs) and 'Linkin Park Hybrid Theory' (the total of both together probably still won't cost you 30 dollars).
1,Pixter Pitiful,"I bought the first gen. Pixter in 2004 for my daughters, it didn't have the updated video features but you could play games on it pretty good. After a few months, it went dead, everytime you turned it on and use the pen the screen would freeze. So I figured ok, this thing has just gone bad.In 2005 I purchased the new and improved Pixter (in pink) for my girls, with the new video feature, and hoped maybe just maybe this one would stick around for a while. Needless to say within two months, the game was blinking on and off and not playing at all. I wrote to Mattel and let them know of their faulty product and they told me to send it to them, I did and they sent it right back, still a broken mess. I'd never buy another Pixter again.Leapfrog has a much better handheld video game Leapster and their games are far more educational and practical than Pixter."
4,"Love it, but watch out for accessories!","My twin 7-y-olds LOVE their Pixters. They spend hours on them. Better in the car than even DVD players, and far more interactive. The only thing I don't like is that all of the accessories I have tried to buy ONLY work on the older Pixter models (called Color Pixter, I believe). The travel case is too small and the digital camera doesn't work either. Now, the camera did say ""requires color pixter systems to work."" I took that to mean they had to have color and not b/w, not that it had to be an older system. The travel case didn't say anything but ""pixter"" on it. So, while I've had to return a few accessories, the kids LOVE the toys. So, would still recommend. Just buy accessories with caution!"
2,"good idea, bad product",We had it for two weeks then it broke. The screen flashes on and off for no reason. Nothing happened to it--it just started doing that. Very weird. No online support available from fisher price for this system either. I bought several games that cannot be played now. The kids liked it while it lasted though. We also have a Leapster which has lasted us eight months so far. My boys like it much better too!! So if you're going to buy a learning system I would recommend the leapster.
3,Poor appearance,"Was very disappointed with the appearance of the product when it arrived. Although exterior packaging was fine, the product itself was banged up, scratched on the face, and the box looked like it was previously opened - despite representation that product was new. Will not buy an electronic product from Amazon again!"
5,It is very stunning !!!,"When I got the pixter for Christmas my eye was shining bright. I thought the pixter was the wrong gift my mother got me . Until when I started playing the pixter I relized it was a very valuable gift . I thought to myself "" I'm going to keep the pixter for a very long time like next year and I belive I would ."" If you buy this gift for you or your family they won't ever get off of it . I t's really great . The games are cool and it even comes with a portable backpack and 2 free games. The games are so challenging . I hope you buy it ."
5,LET ME GET DOWN LET ME GET DOWN,"I think the coolest and most bizarre song I own out of the 5300 songs...I have is Electric Pocket Radio. One Millionth customer is just a cool as hell song layered and built up perfectly. BEEP BEEP Love is unavoidably addictive, and everything in between just rocks. Get this album, you couldn't possibly regret it."
2,Valuable Lessons To Be Learned,"This CD is a valuable teaching tool for songwriter/musicians. The lesson? Just because you are a multi-instrumentalist and can cover different styles, does not necessarily mean you can write a good song. I give Ron Fountenberry credit for his ambitious approach to this album, but let's not be hoodwinked by the musical variety displayed here. Listen closely--none of the songs are very good, and most border on annoying (especially lyrically). To be sure, Fountenberry will regret releasing this in a couple of years."
3,"Recommended if you like Beck, Sean Lennon, Cornershop","Good album. It has a great flow. It stretches boundaries. Listening for the first time was great; it has great surprises on every track. A damn good pop record. First track shocked me back to the 80s...I gave it another chance though cause he doesn't take himself seriously (love is such a beep-beep feeling...great line!). The next song is sweet and, aw hell, fuzzy in a Daniel Johnston kind of way. Next song rocks out indie style. Next one is kinda like Elliott Smith or Paul McCartney on Getting Better All the time. Next one with the Beach Boys intro...just gets better. Next one creeps in like CCR on Born on a Bayou, yet is a cooler, more recent groove. Next song is so sweet, cry worthy. Next one not my style. #9=sweet groove. #10 love, love, love pop music...sweet, even talks about going to church...the perfect Sunday song. The rest is great, I haven't given this much thought to a record in awhile. That alone makes gives it the thumbs up!"
4,one the most eclectic albums I've heard!,"Its not often a album comes out that makes you feel a bunch of different emotions. Its also very seldom that an album comes out that doesn't sound anything like the crap that gets played on the radio 20 times a day. For those 2 reasons and tracks like ""Our One Millionth Customer"", you can't help but to put on a smiley face and go about life like there isn't a worry in the world. He's definetly incredible, he has his own unique style, but most important... he's HIMSELF!!!"
4,It Grows On You,"Moses Leroy's ""Electric Pocket Radio"" may sound odd at first, but it grows on you. I like his diversity. He pulls off different styles of music marvelously. Each song is very entertaining. This album is a lot of fun to listen to."
4,"deep, perverse and compelling","I love this game for its deep alt historical gameplay. I've had the Turks conquer India and half of Germany, I've had France carved up into pizza for all Europe to enjoy, I've had the English Civil War come a century early. so cool.the good stuff, noted by many many other reviewers, is all true.the bad stuff:a)this is a tough game to learn, and i believe you need experience with board strat games to really crack the nut.b) and the box lies on the specs you need to play the game. even with patches etc., i am unable to finish any campaign game i start unless i want to buy more hardware.the silver liningsince i can't finish any game i start, i now have my life back. i found this game very, very compelling."
3,Europa Universalis,"This game is nigh on to impossible to play. I found the tutorial also very difficult to understand. Unless you are very bright or into self torture, I would recommend you take a pass on this version and get either EU II or EU III.I am playing EU III and find it much better but I warn you this is one game you need to read the manual."
2,"Empire building, the hard way","You should definitely buy this game if you want to know what it is like to micromanage the construction and maintenance of a European empire. I don't. Its too much work. I want to build the empire without all the work. I should have saved my money.This product is a good (complex) simulation of Europe with interesting (but not excellent) graphics.Its problems: * Buggy software (It doesn't like running with other software and changed my video mode without restoring it afterward.) * Poor interface (I can't even start to mention all the things that are hard to do and easy to mess up.) * No help managing your units - the only thing they do by themselves is defend when attacked (its a good thing they do!) * No option for alternative geography, so, for example, even though you don't know about the New World, you really do.I really liked the sound of the game so much that I ignored what the other reviews said. I should have listened."
1,"OK, but not great!","I have to vote with the folks who recommend not buying. Terrible manual, clunky-awkward interface, awful tutorial, exceedingly steep learning curve - to name a few problems. It could have been a great game, but it's not. Personally, I think they should take lessons from Sid Meier on how to make a game playable AND enjoyable. Save your money and wait for Civ III, due out in October, 2001."
2,"Way too many lunges, not enough variety","Although the workout is broken into several workouts to pick from, almost all of them include doing a lot of lunges. I was hoping for more variety to include abs and upper body. Doing too many lunges is not good for the knees and does not target other areas. I would only recommend this is you want to to tone your legs, if you are looking to tone all over, pick another dvd."
5,Great Workout,"I really got a good workout from this DVD. It gets the heart pumping and strengthens the body at the same time. Very good for the core. My only issue was that I have bad knees and the curtsy squat/lunges made them hurt. So, I don't go as deep on those and get a great workout. This is one of my favorites."
4,Tough work-out,"This workout is not for the beginner. The first time I used it, I only made it through 2 sets, then 3 sets the next time. It took me several times to work up to the full workout.I don't think the abs workout is long enough. Also, her cues are a little off.Some of the kettlebell moves are not the greatest for your back, especially to KB swings where you come up on one foot and then the other. She also doesn't remind you to use your hips for powerful KB swings during the workout, and for a novice that doesn't know any better, this workout will not be as effective as it should be."
4,Great workout!,"I've been going to a kettlebell class for a few months now but wanted a workout I could do at home. This is a great, challenging workout. It's a good cardio workout while using a lot of core. Your legs and butt will be on fire after this! I use a 12kg/26lb kettlebell but I imagine if you use a lighter kettlebell, you'll still get a lot out of this workout."
3,Good concept..... not for heavier bell users,"I was bored one morning and wanted to find a kettle bell workout video to switch up my routine. I have been using kettle bells for a few years, but was interested to see what people were putting out there as the popularity of kettle bells has rapidly increased. This video has a nice tutorial in the beginning and is broken up into different sets. It also includes a warm up and brief cool down.I use a 12kg (approx 25lb) bell for most of my workouts, and choose heavier bells if the movement requires heavier weight. (ie. double arm swings) However as a female the 12kg bell was often too much for me in this video. Some of the moves, I feel, are down right dangerous if using a heavier bell.If you are looking for a good workout with light weight this should work for you. However if you have a heavier bell, I would not recommend it."
4,More like aerobics with kettlebells as weights,"I am new to using kettlebells and bought this DVD to help me get into a routine of exercises to do. I didn't know what to expect from it. The routine styles would be what I would call aerobic style using weights. in this case the weights are kettlebells. If you don't like the way aerobic workouts (like the popular Firm series, or others geared toward women) are based, then you won't like this. I consider it more aerobic style because it more of lunges, side steps, and feminine moves like that opposed to kicking moves and jumping, in more rough and rugged styles.Although I have always lifted weights (dumbbells) I found this to be difficult to keep up with, endurance wise. I only done it 3 times as of now. I disagree with it being for all levels (beg-adv). I would consider it to be more intermediate. Hard to keep up with at first, but I can seem myself getting better each time and soon will be able to keep up without a problem and plateau."
2,Kettlebell workout?,"wasn't sure exactly what kind of workout this was trying to be. Started out okay but then became trying to do yoga and dance while hanging on to a kettlebell. Seemed very awkward and possibly dangerous to body mechanics. Wow, I deleted that one in a hurry."
5,Challenging and awesome workout,"This workout will challenge you. I have done this workout a couple times and I feel great and empowered after it. Just one suggestion, make sure that you keep proper form to prevent injuries. She has a tutorial that you should go through especially if you are new to kettlebell training. If something does not feel right, stop and adjust. On another note, Angie Miller personality is pleasure. Overall, a wonderful workout to add to your routine."
3,Power body Kettlebell Bootcamp,This item: Power Body: Kettlebell Bootcamp with Angie Miller ~ Angie Miller DVD . price was okay. Shipping was okay. This is a good workout if you can get through it. You feel the burn for sure. Would recommend to others.
5,Kettlebell Bootcamp,"I bought the Kettlebell Bootcamp DVD last winter, 2011. I started out with a 10lb. kettlebell. I was extremely sore the next two days after the workout but persisted. I did the DVD every other day all winter long with an aerobic activity in the days off. I soon began noticing some well defined muscles in my arms and abs! After about 3 weeks I bought a 15 lb. kettlebell because the 10 lb. was feeling a little easy on some of the exercises. I continued with this routine until May when the rowing season started. I felt so strong this year in my rowing shell. Because I row almost every day, I have not done the Kettlebell DVD too much this summer. I will start again next Fall and plan on doing the same routine as last year; kettlebell DVD and aerobic activity ( cross country skiing or ergging on the rowing maching).I have purchased 2 more of these DVD's and given them as gifts along with a 10 lb. kettlebell. I really believe in this workout!"
3,"Good workout, slow tempo","Lots of workouts on this video so there is a lot of variety. Just think the tempo is slow, setup or stage is from the 90's. Okay video."
5,Love it!,"This is a great DVD. Angie Miller is not an instructor I'd heard of before, but her cueing is really good. (She reminds me a little of Cathe.) This is not a ""traditional"" kettlebell workout; it incorporates traditional moves like swings and windmills, but there's also some moves I've never seen before. Really effective at burning calories and building strength. I use both a 12- and 17-pound kettlebell for the exercises. Angie uses a 15-pounder throughout. Broken down into sets, this workout can be done as one long workout (if you dare!). More often I use it as part of a circuit, i.e., alternating one set of the workout with five minutes on the elliptical trainer, for about 45 - 50 minutes. Swinging that kettlebell will really get your heartrate up! Enjoy!"
5,Best Kettlebell Workout!,"This is the best kettlebell workout DVD I have ever done and I've tried quite a few. It really challenges all your muscles but it's also fun to do! Look forward to doing it at least three times a week in between other DVDs so not to get bored, but it is by far my favorite!!"
4,Good Workout,"I started using this after I had a health related one month break from working out. I started with a 5 pound kettlebell, and couldn't get through the workout the first two times. I can get through it now, still using only 5 pounds, as that gets my heart rate up (I use a heart rate monitor) and I am still sore the next day. Now, the first few times I used this, I was quite sore the next day, I have been using this for 3 weeks now, and am only slightly sore the next day. But...with only 5 pounds and only 3 weeks in, I am noticing changes in my body. My arms are more defined, and my booty is definitely lifted. (I do this video 2-3 days a week, spin 2-3 days a week, and belly dance one day a week). Good workout, and it goes fast."
1,terrible,I JUST BOUGHT THIS DVD AND IT IS TERRIBLE. THE WORK IS WAY TOO EASY . DON'T WASTE YOU MONEY
1,DEFECTED,I have no idea if this is a good excerise DVD or not.It did not work as soon as I put it is my DVD player.Not only did the DVD not play it stopped my DVD player frombeing able to player any other DVD's.I am VERY upset about this.
1,Shameful price!,"These jars are adorable *and* available on the ball website for a third of the cost. Shameful pricing, Amazon. They've done this with other items before. Not cool."
1,Significently Overpriced.!!!,I purchased some of these jars from my local grocery store a year ago to store loose tea. They are perfect for this so when I purchased additional varieties of tea I looked for more jars but the grocery store did not have theme jars in stock. I was happy to find them on Amazon and ordered three 4-jar sets as they are also great for storing my dried herbs and small sewing notions. Between the time I placed the order and it arrived I saw that the jars were back on the grocery store shelf. I was dismayed to see that I could have purchased three sets from the grocery store for what I paid for one set from Amazon. I'm so accustomed to Amazon's usually great pricing that I didn't think to check on the pricing for a set of these jars... a mistake I'll not make again! I've been an Amazon customer since the early days and this is the first time I've seen such a huge pricing discrepancy between Amazon prices and pricing by other retailers. Really disappointing!!!
3,Grande Foote-Big Foot South American style.,"A simple adventure story written to be translated to the big screen. Mountains is the sequel, but not continuation, of the better known Island at the Top of the World novel that was made into a movie.If you like an adventure story in the vein of Verne or Cussler, than you will probably like theis book."
2,Nicely made with a serious flaw,What at first appeared to be a nicely built tool had a crude design on the cutting wheel mount. It was simply a screw threaded full length and undersized to the cutting wheel center hole. I used it once and the cutting wheel and screw threads were already damaged where the wheel tries to turn on the threads of the screw. They obviously know how to do it right because the two guide wheels were nicely mounted. So I don't know why they didn't give the cutting wheel a nice mounting.
1,Product review,Well it is sad to say i have not received this book that o bught on Amazon. I was dubbed by the seller he never shiped the book but he took my money. I am an angry man.
1,"A degradation, no, he was always bad","...Not only is DKR and it's sequel not for children, which is fairly well-known by now, it is also not for adults that feel there is anything worthwhile in the human condition. If you don't believe in heroes yourself, and what's more don't want anyone else to, this is your book. Otherwise, find other sources of superhero fiction"
4,dk 2,A truly worthy sequel which says a lot if you read and loved the first. I expected to hate it thinking it was something of a cash cow but Miller has played a blinder
1,Badly Drawn Art and Useless Use of Pornography,"DK1 was a great graphic novel featuring a new Robin and a newly retold Batman. But when I read DK2, the whole story of the Dark Knight Returns fell unsuccessfully. The story had no structure and there was no meaning. DK2 is definetely not the best choice of comic books and graphic novels to purchase. Avoid this book only if you are a civilized man. If you are a man who is in need of passion, purchase this book and read off the pictures of nude women."
1,I am SO confused.....???,"Okay, I'm just going to give you a quick impression of the whole ""Dark Knight Strikes Again"" series after just finishing book 3. Ummm...what the HELL is going on? What did I just read? I don't know what Frank Miller or DC was thinking ($$$) but I could barely follow the ""plot"" of this story. Add to that the nearly incomprehensible artwork (there is also NO sense of space, all the characters might as well be flying in the air the whole time)and the random appearance of DC superheroes (oh look, it's Hawk & Dove...how cute) and you get one of the worst comics I have ever read. The original ""Dark Knight Returns"" was a triumph, unfortunately ""The Dark Knight Strikes Again"" is a disgrace....sorry to be so cruel but geez........."
2,Obligations?,There are some projects that seem to be completed only because of legal obligations -- or because the money is too good to turn down.At least the Godfather series didn't get bad until part III . . .
2,"""Let's see how much money we can make off the original.""","... Its not well written and the huge splash pages seem like an excuse to extend a story that could have easily been told in one issue to three so that the DC could maximize profits. Sure, the art is pretty good; a little overly CGed for my taste, but that could just be me. Its that it doesn't have the grime and grit of the original series that really drew the reader in to this recreated world of a defeated Dark Knight detective. The whole story seems contrived: Bats beats up on Supes.... again. Seemingly to show that, yep, Batman is still ... bad ... and Big Blue is still a dumb wimp.No new territory is gone over in terms of characterization, which is what made the original so fascinating. In the original DKR, Miller truly broke Batman's character into his component parts, studied them, and showed the readers how Bruce would react in this futuristic distopia.Don't bother with this one kiddies, its not worth the [money]."
4,Heh heh.,This has got to be the zaniest and odd books I've ever encountered. And the fact that people are so desperately trying to take it seriously instead of sitting back and watching it unfold before their eyes and then judging it. So eager to criticise so reluctant to enjoy.
2,Godfather 3 was way less disappointing.,"Did you love ""The Dark Knight Returns""?If so, stay away from this celebration of idiocy.The best thing about this series is that it's over."
1,THE DARK KNIGHT FALLS (FLAT ON HIS FACE)...,"Having finished the third installment of Miller's latest epic,I have to agree with the consensus of others who read it...it was a lot of hope that turned into hype. To his credit, Miller didn't go the safe route with Batman and decided to take some chances. The problem was that in the original ""Dark Knight Returns"", Batman was true to his roots, which hooked readers for 60 years plus. In DK2, he comes off at times as a bad borscht belt comedian, especially with his dealings with Dick Grayson in volume three. And what does he have against the original Robin and Superman (he gets the super snot beated out of him yet again)? It made me appreciate Klaus Janson's inking of the original series (background detail is all but eliminated in DK2), and the presence of Denny O'Neil's editing is sorely missed. DK2 is proof that sometimes you can't catch lightning in a bottle..."
2,Very disappointing,"I am sad to say that this book was disappointing, even though a friend had already warned me it did not measure up to the original. The art and story are... sloppy. It's almost as if someone were hired to create this comic in the style of Frank Miller - it's such a pale imitation that it is hard to believe it's really him behind the scenes. The splash-pages in the original were breathtaking; here, they're laughable.And doesn't Miller know that Naked News already exists? Hardly a futuristic concept.My recommendation: get yourself a copy of the original."
2,K,"""Dark Knight Returns"" was visionary and the execution was gripping. I liked the idea of seeing aged super heroes fighting in a world that refused their existence. Frank Miller had an important job on his hands when he wanted to write a sequel. I am afraid that ""Dark Knight Strikes Again"" does not live up to expectations. It falls far behind the first one. The story and the telling is a replication, introducing new super heroes to keep the attention. I fear that whatever happens in the end will not surprise me. Buy it if you want to complete DK series."
4,"Excellent, but missing Klaus Janson","Miller clearly has thought out an excellent storyline that won't disappoint readers with the return of the seminal Dark Knight series. As with the first series, Miller wastes no time building tension and energy into the storyline, waeving multiple threads into a fast-paced plot.The art on the other hand I find lacking compared to the first series, which featured in my opinion some of the most striking, seminal artwork to appear in comics at the time it was published. This time the work looks slightly unfinished and hurried, with a few panels that Miller and Varley should have simply redone. Clearly the influence of Klaus Janson would have helped develop the art further, as a quick comparison to the first series would illustrate.All in all, this is definitely worth owning and it is likely that many comic collectors will find it impossible not to buy this entire series, regardless of the reviews."
1,Garbage,"Says an editor inside DC, "" Paul Levitz got leaned on by Warner Bros. to just put out the last issue of this mess because Frank had to work on Batman screenplays. Levitz wasn't even going to put out the third issue because in addition to the horrible art, the story never went anywhere, resloved anything. We can't put this out."" Levitz thought it was very bad. Alex Ross said in a Wizard int.,""Miller just agreed to do the project because DC said they'd pay to move him to NYC."" Many Miller sheep follow still follow him no matter what but sadly, this abomination should never have come to pass. -Rick"
1,"Wait, now Kent's with Luthor? Eh...","To be honest, this almost ruins ""The Dark Knight Returns"". I always liked the conflict between Batman and Superman. Who's right? Batman, for freeing people or Superman, for simply saving lives. Both thought they were in the right, which is why their battle at the end of DKR was so monumental. Now, however, Superman is working for Lex Luthor, and is, clearly, on the side of the ""bad guys"". Frankie, frankie frankie, why did you do this? I personally loved the Wayne-Kent moral struggle, and now you turned it into a battle of the super-villains. This book is worth buying for the art and the well done super-hero introductions. However, the plot is VERY lacking."
2,15 years for this?,"The whole story is only in three parts. Each chapter is a fraction of the size of the first mini-series. Yet, with all of those constraints, Frank ""I forgot how to draw"" Miller wastes pages on single pictures spanning 2 pages apiece. If it's the bat-plane-something hovering or Superman impregnating Wonder Woman, it's given it's own spread.The story is too slender for his epic style, the drawing too crude and the guest cast too generous. This is a BATMAN book, not The Atom or Plastic Man. Yet these guys get more of the story than Bats.I don't see the point to this except a sell out to get fanboys to spend their hard-earned moolah on this crapola. Yeah, I also am a sucker who bought it in the hopes it would be a worthy follow-up to a classic original. But, like Superman 4, get it only if you are a completist."
1,Battle of the Franchised Superheroes,"I can't think of a graphic novel I've looked forward to more, nor can I think of one that disappointed me more bitterly. Garish colors, clunky art (with dayglo two-page spreads), and a plot that defies all logic. It seems that Miller's goal was to squeeze in as many DC superheroes as possible, but if you haven't followed all of their rampaging plotlines for the past decade or so, you'll be constantly wondering who's who and who's doing what to what. I expect Kitchen Sink Man to show up any minute. I love the first DK graphic novel, and have enjoyed Miller's other work, but this is more like Bizarro-Miller than the creator whose work I've admired in the past. For fanboys only."
4,Simply Great!,"This album, the follow up to ""Third Eye Open: String Tribute to Tool"", is simply great. Each song melds beautifully with the others for a trully relaxing experience. Though some tracks have slight flaws in the rythms, most capture the darkness and beauty that is TOOL. I gave it only four stars because of the afformentioned flaws, but the cd is great none-the-less. If you are a fan of Tool, then it is worth your while to check this album out."
2,Not my cup of tea,Wish I had stolen this album before buying it. I've heard various tracks from these guys and really liked it but there were no stand out tracks on this album.
5,Keep connected with God,"I always knew that there was a wealth of riches in the the Gospel readings, but this series of meditations brings out those riches like I never thought possible. None of the meditations simply ramble on. They evoke the scene, help you enter it and then draw out the honey by provokibg thoughts of generosity and correspondence to God's will, present in the everyday realities. Each meditation guides you to a freely assumed resolution to embrace sanctity and really gives you the sense that with God all is possible, even our holiness in todays world. Plus the wealth of quotations from the saints and the fathers of the Church help does underline that the Church is one multifaceted family. A worthwhile investment."
1,Still waiting . . .,"I'm sure that the book is excellent, as we've got others of the series, but the problem is that we're still waiting it's arrival! It really is unacceptable to be waiting now close to 7 weeks for a book to arrive. Very disappointed. Amazon needs to take responsibility for some of these vendors that do not meet the standards."
1,garbage,this thing came with the 5th (blue) wire separated from the rest. sure it was connected at both ends but it was separate from the main bundle of other 4 wires which were molded together. what a horrible mess of a tangled up hairball! useless!
5,hot new teen series,Precious my daughter read this book in one day!!! She loved it!!! I am so excited to see this genre of book that OUR young ladies can read and relate too. Looking forward to the next book!!!
2,Top hits? I think not,"I never heard of at least half of these songs. I bought it presuming that I would recognize them after I heard them, but really I didn't. Who dreamed there was a song about The Pill? So I fast forward to my favorites and skip over half the album."
2,Way to long in the fingers for kids.,"I bought these for my son, and they were big enough to fit my hands. Had to take up each finger a whole inch to fit."
3,Nice but not as funny as I was hoping,"I ordered this calendar thinking that it was going to be especially humorous, but was rather let down. Nuns Having Fun sounds like a great idea for a calendar, but I think this one failed to meet my expectations. My aunt is a nun and I feel like she would not be as impressed either. I have a few suggestions for a future calendar:1 Nuns playing practical jokes (Saran wrapping the toilet seat)2 Nuns water ballooning teenagers3 Nuns hazing new nuns (swirly's)4 Nuns skydiving5 Nuns skateboarding in a skate parkThere are so many great opportunities!"
5,Hilarious and Practical Too,"I loved this calendar so much I bought two- one to use and one to frame the best of the images. These pictures are wonderful- beautiful black and whites of nuns in casinos, looking at nude art, on the beach, drinking beer, etc. These are real women having the time of their lives, in full habit no less. Looking at the calendar every morning is a reminder to have a great day and not to take life too seriously. As a practical matter, the squares are large enough to put a lot of info on, so even people with busy schedules can keep it all in one place."
5,A fun calendar for people who have been taught by nuns,"This calendar blows the doors off those individuals that think all nuns are stodgy ruler-wielding teachers. Yes, nuns can have fun!"
2,Nice Try,The concept of this book was actually very interesting. It could have been a great read had the author just told us his thoughts on this subject rather than trying to make an adventure story out of it. The writing style made it very hard for me to want to finish this book even though I liked the idea behind the story. Kind of disappointing.
2,Polarising reviews,"Yep this book has a story line about 1mm deep, amazing coincidences one after the other, so predictable I lost interest a few times. A literary masterpiece it aint, no question there.As another reviewer has already said, the spiritual prophesy seems to be a mixture of philosophies /religions e.g. Gnosticism, Jung, Zen, Sufism all bundled into a ""new awakening"" that is supposedly Inca/Mayan in origin, (couldn't quite figure that bit out).So, if you've read lots of books on the above, you would find this book pretty banal, but if you haven't read much like the above, then this is probably an ""eye opening"" experience that also happens to be easy to read on a subway train.Depends where you are currently at, as to how you respond to it - that's why there's a huge polarity in reviews."
4,Some good concepts,To be fair the book had some good concepts. I personally got more out of Converstations With God and Encounter With A Prophet. But this book was certainly not bad.
1,I know better now,"I read this book in high school and was totally engrossed by it. I thought ""This is it!, now I know the meaning to life!"" But hey folks, I was a stupid teen trying to find out what I was here for. That's why it worked for me. Then I went to college and learned some real things and see that this book and it's ""insights"" (if they can even be called that) are a complete joke! I defended this book many a time on the net, but I wish I could go erase those things I wrote now because I was pathetically mistaken. The supporter's are entitled to their opinion, but my advice is this: please don't accept this so blindly. Look around you and see the real things that matter!"
5,It helped me on the path back to God.,"I cant understand why some people hate this book.I truly think this book got my life back on track.One does not have to take this book as real events, but rather ideas you can apply to your own life.It truly changed me."
1,Silly,"This book was downright silly. I read it back when I was in college and I, as many of the other reviewers here felt like I was reading some extended story from an 8th grader. (actually, I think the stuff written by my classmates back in the 8th grade was more interesting).Just silly."
1,Laughable,"Laughably badly written, plotted & researched. Cereal boxes have better character construction, spiritual insights and dialog. Makes you feel embarrassed for the writer and anybody who takes this 'book' (using the term loosely) seriously."
1,Deadly stuff,This book is dull and so badly written I am astonished it found its way to print and commercial sale. Fortunately the first insight explains the value of coincidence because everything that follows is appallingly contrived. The author might have done better to write a brief article about his new age philosophy because he is not capable of clothing it in fiction.
3,Nothing to write home about!,"I read this book last year. While I don't disagree with anything in that book, I think it's mostly fluff and cotton candy. Kind of exciting and fun to read, but when finished and forgotten, never really having done you much good. The author only says what he knows people want to here. But he never delves deeply into things. (I have nothing against that. In fact, I wish I could do it. The book has obviously made a lot of money.)If you want to read a really good book about similar topics, I really recommend ""The Tao of Physics"". This book will blow your mind, and take you to new levels of thinking far better than ""The Clestine Prophecy"" does. Read it!!"
1,"I wanted to like this book, I really did","O.K. the writing style wasn't up to much, but then neither was Tolkien's. That's forgivable. Don't get me wrong, I'm no dyed in the wool sceptic. Far from it. I loathed this book, because much better and more profound ideas were being regurgitated at me. The author wasn't bringing these ideas to a wider audience, but just removing anything that didn't fit his readers pre-conceptions. If you liked this, go and read Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance. You might not like it, but it will challenge your preconceptions."
2,Enlightenment pulp fiction,"It's hard for me to categorize this book as a novel or as a ""statement of belief"". Let's say it tries to be much more than it is. The plot is rather ludicrous and the writing is pretty shabby, but the ideas are interesting and some are even compelling. Fortunately it isn't too long so if you decide to read it and end up hating it at least you haven't wasted too much of your life."
3,Spacy,"I got this book because my church was previewing the film based on it (I didn't make it to the screening). Despite the banal prose style, the new age philosophy pulled me along for most of the way---most coincidences aren't really such; everyone has an aura; positive interactions with people generate energy, but the author lost me at the end with the suggestion that there's a higher level of consciousness that just causes people to disappear, rapture-like. Supposedly, this is what happened to the Mayans. For a more likely explanation, check out Charles Mann's ""1491"". Still, I'll give three stars for an easily digested alternative look at spirituality."
1,An Unworthy Read - don't waste your time or money!,"What an absolute waste of my time. Not only is the writing style tremendously underdeveloped, but the characters are simple and simple minded. I decided to give the book a chance and plodded along to the end hoping to find that ""Aha!"" moment. Not possible. Moreover, there was not one insight which I found inspirational, and my world did not expand upon completion of the book.I can't believe that Redfield actually left an open ended conclusion so he could leave room for a sequel of the same superficial sort. It was a challenge to finish the book, but I did -- if it was only so I could write a credible review. The book is not a spiritual adventure, but rather a treatise on how to live combining elements of Buddhism, Kubbutzism and Communism. If you want to read a really meaningful and life changing book I recommend Andy Andrews The Travelers Gift."
3,Packaged centuries old ideas with undergrad writing skill,"James Redfield has read a lot of books (eastern spirituality etc)and packaged what he has learnt into a tolerably engaging story. The good thing is that he uses his ""adventure parable"" to teach well known ideas. The bad thing is that he lets the reader believe that he has pulled the ideas out of thin air and introduced a ""new"" spirituality. He would do well to let readers know the true source of his ideas so that rather than ""seeing"" him as the source, the readers can go to the true sources to further investigate what they seek. That said, it was an intersting read nonetheless."
2,Highly disappointing,"I could not understand why this book was so popular. The idea was cool, but Mr. Redfield is a mediocre writer. His generic descriptions of people and places were typical of junior high school creative writing and his main character (as well as all the other characters) had no personality."
1,Best for Hippies & followers of Environmentalism as a religion.,"The story is basically about seeing & understanding the ""aura"" that is supposedly around everyone ""best seen by looking a people while consciously soft focusing your eyes"". Yikes!Has plenty of ""Can't we all just get along"" type of hippie dippy touchy-feely philosophy with lots of environmental whacko (say Rain Forest when you mean jungle, Wet Lands when you mean swamp) sophistry thrown-in.I was able to finish the 3 CDs only by the application of tremendous willpower.Not recommend."
4,"Almost as good as CS lewis' ""Perelandra.""","I read this and then thought maybe there's hope for humanity. Then I read all these slams of it by pop-reviewers and think otherwise. C'mon, people: judge it as a story; not by it's philosophy or politics. I can't imagine what you all would say about a published version of the unabomber's manifesto. =("
2,It wouldn't be so hard to take if it were better written,The plot doesn't necessarily need to be plausible in a book about spiritual mystery. It amazes me every time that people who can't write can get published. I think that the books popularity speaks volumes to how spiritually starved we are as a culture. There has to be a better way to present this message.
2,A poor meal for the spiritually hungry.,This book is filled with New Age feel-good pseudoscientific psychobabble that has all the merit and validity of the Psychic Friends Network.
1,What would Jesus do?,"After plowing through James Refield's Celestine Prophecy, I can't help but think of what Jesus himself would have to say about the way He was portrayed at the end of the book as a prime example of someone who had mastered the ""Insights"". My guess is that He would have cautioned Mr. Redfield to keep His name out of it.What makes this dribble so maddening is the way that Redfield uses a ""B"" movie plot to gloss over the patent shortcomings of the ""religion"" put forth in this book.In the words of C.S. Lewis (who Redfield might benefit from reading, not only to get a better understanding of Christ, but the learn how to write), there are only two religions in this world, Christianity and Hinduism. Let me guess which one this book is? Poor James Redfield! I guess in order for him to get to the real truth he'll need to start over."
3,some potential,"The book caught my imagination from the offset then the author's writing went on a tangent with the sole intention of selling his ideas.I enjoyed the messages, which may also be found in other self-help books. If you enjoyed this one I recommend you read Valkyries by Paulo Coelho, which is deeper and more meaningful as it is a personal account."
2,unbelievably corny writing,"I picked up the book IMMEDIATELY after a strong recommendation whereby I thought that the book is based off of a REAL, ancient lost manuscript. Little did I know that it was cheesy fiction. The first insights are interesting and make sense. The more you read the book however, the more you feel someone is trying to guile you and make you think you are finding all the answers while you keep pushing yourself to think the book may get better-NOT."
3,Good Insights; But Don't Make A Bible Out of It,"I read this book for the first time in 1994, and just now finished a quick reread after a friend mentioned it in passing. The writing seems at least a little better than the Left Behind adventures now so popular. And I must say I am more inclined to the vision of spirituality as an unfolding reality found here than to the Christian fundamentalist apocalyptic scenario detailed in Left Behind. But I wouldn't get too hung up on developing your vibration level or looking for hidden messages or conicidences in life experience. Just find a good cenetering technique, usually associated with the mystical traditions of established religions, and stick with it over time."
1,The Celestine Fallacy: A Misadventure,"The star rating for this book should read ZERO, but there was no zero option for me to choose! For those already spiritually 'sussed' it offers nothing new. For those who are mildly interested and are just stepping into the world of new ideas and thinking in terms of 'the meaning of life' then this book will probably put you off. There are great books out there that are completely justified in describing themselves as 'life-changing' or 'life-affirming'. Unfortunately, this is most definitely not one of them."
3,The Celestine Prophecy adn The Tenth Insight,"Good day to all, I am Seifer from jj_juice@hotmail.comSince reading these two books I have take a new approach to life. With help from James Redfield's thoughts I have been able to awaken an inner self I have always known. I've enjoyed these two books immensly and look forward to reading further insights. I would really appreciate those who could suggest other books that they have read similar to those of Redfield's and I would be happy to return the favour if anyone would like to know any other recommendations then let me know at: jj_juice@hotmail.comThanks and good luck to all"
1,Nonsensical,The hype this book received was undeserving. It was certainly not life changing to me. It was boring and I had to force myself to continue in the hope that there would be a thrilling climax; this was more of an anticlimax! I certainly will not be reading any of the associated books. It was definitely a waste of money!
2,"Not Great, but Not Bad Either.","I saw the poor reviews, but I thought the book was okay, mildly entertaining: certainly not deserving the initial attention it got several years ago. Two books that were far more interesting with similiar new age themes were: The Alchemist, by Paulo Coelho; and LUMINOUS by Peter Quest. Both had better prose and the characters in LUMINOUS seemed very real, plus great action scenes."
1,Is there a MINUS 5 star rating?,"So glad I never spent real money on this waste of time. Kept waiting for something profound to happen. Redfield should invest in a thesaurus to at least make the writing palatable. The plot was ludicrous, the ""philosophy"" puerile. Save us from these ""best sellers"". The publisher should also be ashamed of foisting this crap on the reading public."
5,Very Spiritual,"I really liked this book, because of its spiritual and its action, it was bouth enlightning and yet it was always some action involved, a little mystery here and there, some romance in the middle, very very good"
5,This book challenges us to raise our consciousness,"This book I highly recommend to those who have become aware of their family of origin's disfunctions. It helps to identify the four control dramas most people are stuck in.When one reads these , one can identify their own most dominant control drama, and begin, if willing, to disengage from it. It also makes one aware of what they draw to them and how to, identify and disengage in a healthy way. Once you become consciously aware of these dramas, every else falls into place and the coinsidences are recognized, thus giving one the opportunity for growth and evolution. If you get nothing else from this book , this simple lesson can take you far. Gail Fo"
1,dime-store philosophy,"It is amazing, with the plethora of really good, exciting and substantial books on development, spirituality and philosophy available, that this volume caused such a stir. In my country it was all the rage, now forgotten, like a butterfly. Yoganandas Autobiography or Alexandra David-Neels brilliant books of travel in Tibet hover so far above this book in depth, quality and suspense that 1 star is inevitable."
1,The tenth insight: the author is a fraud.,"In my spiritual search, I bought the book five years ago. I couldn't finish the book because it was so boring and I didin't understand any of the so called ""insidhgts"".I few month ago, I had a spiritual awakening, enlightenment, or being visited by holy spirit in Christian term. I reread the book again. I found it a commercial inspired book not spiritual inspired. Apparently the author hadn't experienced the presence of God. He falsely believed the ""energy"" could only be harvested from over 500 year old trees. He forgot that Jesus lived near a desert. There are ""energy"" everywhere when we look at at sky, look down at the earth, or look around. There is ""God"" everywhere.The author didn't provide any tangible way to approach ""God"" either. All those so called ""insights"" weren't any better than SNL deep thoughts."
1,James Redfield must be stopped!,"I hope they make a time machine before I die so I can go back in time and PREVENT Redfield from writing this book. Come on, Redfield! ANY high school English teacher would have MADE you rewrite this book with characters that have DEPTH and a PLOT. This was supposed to be a story, RIGHT? Granted the ""insights"" have some interest I suppose. Although you (Redfield) could have wrote the insights down on ONE PIECE OF PAPER and stood on the corner handing them out. Wouldn't make any money would you, Redfield. If your ""insights"" are so damn important why didn't you write them down in some fancy brochure and mail them out? And who are the editors who ""okayed"" this book? Their writing must be just as bad. And on top of all this there is a tenth insight?!?! HERE'S AN INSIGHT TO ALL POTENTIAL BUYERS OF THIS BOOK >>> DO NOT! <<. I REPEAT, DO NOT! Do not WASTE your MONEY! Every reviewer who ripped on this book are exactly right!!"
1,Toilet paper,"It's been a pleasure to skim over other peoples' reviews and see that the majority felt, as I did, that this book was incredibly poorly written and shallow. I kept wondering, even halfway through the book, when I was finally going to see some meat to this story. Instead I was led by the hand through this character's so-called ""journey,"" told that he experienced great enlightenment, although not encouraged to experience that with him, and generally cheated of any meaningful experience whatsoever. I think that ""A reader in Seattle, WA,"" who posted on 9/4/97, described the shortcomings of this book really well, check out his review, too!"
1,"A WASTE, COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT!","WHAT IS ALL THE HOOPLA ABOUT? I PICKED UP THIS BOOK, WITH THE EXCITEMENT THAT SHOULD GO TO THE LARGEST SELLING BOOK IN THE PAST TWO YEARS AND WAS TOTALLY SHOCKED. SHOCKED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY GOT THROUGH IT. WHAT DID I MISS? WHERE WAS THIS GREAT? I FOUND IT POORLY WRITTEN, AND REALLY ABOUT NOTHING. TELL ME WHAT I MISSED."
2,I read this book and promptly forgot most of it!,"Having thoroughly enjoyed Carlos Castenedas books ,althoughdisallusioned to find none of it was really factual,I expected a goodread from the Celestine Prophecy. I generally put aside all critical reasoning when I read this type of philosophical fantasy and let my subconcious mind ruminate on the plot. The final result? The story and plot are trivial. The insights rather simplistic and forgetful,for the most part. I really believe this books popularity is an example of many peoples desire to regain a spirituality and belief in the afterlife which our mechanistic/scientific society has all but destroyed. Wouldn't it be wonderful if his premise were true!"
1,Opiate of the masses?,"Spiritual fulfillment is now available as a nine step""Jenny Craig"" like program. How wonderful! I can easilyimagine a warm reception by a public ""desperately"" seeking easy solutions to life's difficult challenges. This book actually had a few interesting insights. However, it was about 200 (of 246) pages too long. I was longing for the end long before it came. Interestingly, I had just finished the last of Wouk's WW2 epic ""War and Remembrance"" (well over 1000 pages) and was left longing for more. By depth of insight, these books compare like the Pacific Ocean and the kiddie pool."
2,Completely lost me...,"So tell me now, if we were all clairvoyants, could it be possible that we all could actually see one another's auras?Are you certain Redfield hadn't smoked a joint first before he wrote this book, because it sounded like he was most likely trippin'....One of the most controversial part of the book had to do with a white calf, but honestly I just couldn't finish the book nor get a really good grasp of its concept."
2,Wow.,"Read the first 50 pages. It's crap. The ideas are decent about the ""insights"" but it seems like it was written by someone who has a degree in english from a community college that at some point read a REAL book about some existential stuff and only understood about half of it. This book is for Nicholas Sparks readers who want something ""more"". It's like DaVinci Code Light: Caffiene Free."
1,good read,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. Much of what was said rings true for me. I love the insights and the dramas. This was the best of the 3 books in the series, but they are all worth reading. Still waiting for the twelfth insight."
1,Worst...Novel...Ever,"This book has to be the worst written book ever to slip through a publishing house for approval...at least I hope so.The writing is horrible. Let me amend that...the first 43 pages are horrible. I couldn't stomach any more than that. Perhaps starting on page 44, the story turns into ""A Tale of Two Cities.""I read this when I was steeped in New Age ideas. I still subscribe to many of them. But that book...arrrg! Pure crap. Maybe it had some value in its principles it was trying to jam down my throat, but puleeze, this book was truly painful from a storyteller's point of view."
5,Touched My Life!,"I first read this book over 15 years ago. I couldn't put it down! It was billed as a mystery but it's so much more. I have read it every summer for the next 5 years and always find out more. I find that when I use the insights in my daily life, I am at peace. I am going to get out my old copy and read it again! You need to be open minded and flexible when reading this book. Not everything will make sense the first time but if you center yourself and quietly reflect you will find the Aha moment in your own life."
5,Celestine Prophecy Great Reading,"One must read the book to become aware of what this book truly holds betweenits cover. Knowing coincedences, realizing there is a reason why they happenmight be more prevalent on the cover but word of mouth is why I bought this book and recommended it to others. It truly is an amazing read which I believewill enlighten the most well read person."
5,"I know, I know... bad writing, good ideas.","So in looking at many of the review, I'll have to admit that the writing in this book leaves much to be desired. However, the ideas he presents have really made an impact on my life. For me, the ""insights"" he discusses really articulated some things that I've always believed:1. Coincidences are often meaningful.2. There is energy in the universe that connects all matter. We area system and everything that happens affects something else.3. We need to find ways to keep ourselves ""filled"" with energy so thatwe can help others better.4. We can connect to this universal energy to give and receive from others.I liked it!"
1,"If this book changes your life, what else did you read?","From such a bestseller I expected at least mediocre content, but it proved to be below that. There are no characters in this book, no dialogues, and almost no plot. At least not in the firts two thirds of the book, 'cause I couldn't force myself to read any further. From page to page I kept hoping for some improvement but it didn't came. The ideas offered through ""Insights"" are not developed enough... already seen... cheap psychology... They are not worth reading the book, and the wrapping around those ideas is by far worse."
5,A must for any collection,"This story is well written. The extremists will have you believe that you are suposed to change religions because of it. If anything, you'll examine the insights in perspective to your own life, you may come to some very interesting conclusions and maybe even form a few questions. The insights are to highten ones spirituality awareness, not change religions. As you go through the story, keep an opend mind and enjoy. You may find yourself relating to some aspects of the book."
3,Excellent plot and insights buried in cheesy writing,"The insights that the author is trying to make people think about are really valuable, and I did get a lot out of the book. Almost gave it four stars but the writing is so darn awful in places: cheesy prose and so full of typos that I was wondering if anyone actually edited it!"
2,This book is hokey.,"The Celestine Prophecy came highly recommended from friends. While some of the ideas it raised were interesting, the book was disappointing and hokey."
1,Man goes on a journey to learn to secrets of life,One of the worst books I have ever read. Utterly trite and condescending. The only reason I finished the book is that I have a long-standing policy to finish every book I start. This was one book for which I should have ignored my own policy. Don't even waste your time.
3,"Great concept, mediocre book.","Redfield writes vividly about spirituality and its components: energy, auras, etc. However, the underlying plot is a bit dull. If you like these concepts, try Crichton's ""Travels"" or possibly a Daniel Quinn book (for differnt ways of looking at the world)."
1,"""oh the world is full of stupid people...""","I am continuously amazed at how many people are willing to give in to irrational ideals that make them feel better about themselves. Alas, many of these persons look down upon critical thinking as being close-minded and cut-off from God. They are sheep, and members of a not so elite flock that is herded to and fro according to the ramblings of a psychopathic megalomaniac, or a fool. This time a fool only because he and his forbears got there first. A coincidence I am thankful for."
3,Beware the Religion Mongers and the Shallow Elite,"The best of spirituality unites humans, the worst of religion divides them. Although I would agree that, sometimes, the writing and ideas in CP are somewhat simplistic, Mr. Redfield is, admirably, part of the former, while most of the negative reviewers are obviously part of the later or the shallow elite, who can't see beyond thier own ego blindedness and that's too bad for everyone, but most of all, for them."
5,Good for Spiritual People of Any Religion,"I found this book to be very good. I found myself relating to many of the Insights, and I had trouble putting it away. I often figured things out much faster than ole Mister Main Character, which brought me to say, Come on now, you idiot, use your brain! many times. Other than that, I enjoyed it. THOUGH; if you aren't a spiritual person I don't think you will enjoy this book. It seems from the reviews that you will either hate the book or like it. SO, I would recommend this to any spiritual person; but it will not interest everyone."
4,Great for those with prior knowledge,"This book was recommended to me by a friend and i cam upon it at a used book store the next day. Having many years of spiritual studies under my belt already, I found the lessons easy to absorb and actually what I needed at that point in my life. It opened my eyes to so much that I had been closed to. I find myself talking excitedly about it amongst my friends, and they says ""oh, I know that"", but I say in return"" but do you live it? Do you apply yourself to it? Do you stay open and aware?"" that is the difference. Though it may not be the best literature wise, if the lessons are applied to your life, things start to happen. They did with me. More than the adventurous story and the fanciful end, the lessons portrayed in the book are worth reading."
3,"Poor writing, okay content","Like another review stating that ""The Celestine Prophecy is a wonderful book for those who are least concerned with fine literature and more concerned with beginning a quest into understanding the greater meaning of our existence,"" I too found it to be mildly captivating for its content and quite pedestrian for its writing style and grammatical errors. For instance, reading ""a small number HAVE anything to do with research...(page 166 of 602, EBooks)"" or the verb 'walked' every other sentence (has the author ever heard of sauntering, strolling, inching, climbing, descending, etc...? I wonder...) reduces by a large extent its impact, at least for me. How can we respect the author's efforts when he hasn't even made the effort to hire a decent editor?"
3,I don't think so...,"I read this book years ago, and I wasn't terribly impressed with it. The story used to deliver the message could have been more entertaining, and the message itself is more than a little ""out there"". However, I'll give it three stars for two reasons:1) There's a part in this book about noticing and paying attention to coincidences, something I strongly believe in.2) There is also a part about the differences between people who create their own energy, as opposed to those who have to steal it from others. I'm not so sure this has anything to do with energy, but it works well as a metaphor. I think everyone can think of people who are difficult to be around, because they take so much of your positive ""energy"", in an effort to give themselves a boost.I wouldn't advice against buying this book, but I can't recommend it either. It does have its good points, but there aren't enough of them."
1,We are all stupider for having read this book.,"Like, so, um, everything that happens, is like um, for a reason or something? Like, things that ""happen"" don't just like ""happen.""No way!Way!This is the McDonald's Happy Meal of philosophy. I am embarrassed for America, and ashamed to have been one of the 8 million+ fools who read it. Ricki Lake is more profound."
1,Mistitled,"Why didn't the author discard the pretense and title this ""Sweet Valley High's Spiritual Retreat""?"
1,Redfield's Tenth Insight,"Redfield's real insight was how to steal other people's insights and fabricate faux-nonfiction.For those people who found this book good or fascinating, all I can say is ""Keep Reading till you find a genuine source of insights."""
2,Gift,"This was a gift. I struggled through it. The fiction aspect was poorly written. The philosophical aspect seemed to come from Eric Berne's work. The historical references were way off from what is currently known about Peru and the dates involved. I personally found the jargon tedious. Characterization was thin. Once again, the Roman Catholic Church was the 'bad guy'. That also gets tiresome. So many people found this book to be helpful in their outlook on life so for that, I gave it 2 stars. For me --- it was much less enlightening and inspiring than other works I've read."
1,Propose a '0' Rating For This Book!,"'The Celestine Prophecy' is really idiotic, I feel quite sorryfor the man who translated it into Chinese. Chinese translation ofthis book has sold thousands of copies in Taiwan but, to my relief, didn't get in local 'bestsellers' list. Hope that I won't see the Chinese translation of 'The Tenth Insight.'"
2,Overrated but interesting spiritually,"I can't believe all the hype CP has gotten!?! Ratherthan reading this book, I recommend The Alchemistby Paulo Coelho. It is about a true spiritualjourney AND is well written."
2,An overhyped book and one of the worst written,"Having been given this book as a present by my son whoclaims he was inspired by the narative, I was very let down.For a book that is basically suppose to be for selfenlightenment why did the author go to this hokey story line.He would have been better off writing it as a straight bookfor enlightenment... That is if he could write!!!! If you wantto see what writing is all about read Umberto Eco's newmagnificent novel ""The Island Of The Day Before"".A guess to sell a best seller today you need to write to thelevel of the masses.. A sad commentary on our times."
4,Redfield is a pioneer.,"Perhaps my tastes are overly simple. Maybe I am just not a ""high-brow"" reader, or a ""top-shelf"" buyer. I am just your average sort of middle class American, trying to make a living, enjoy life and figure out what we are doing here anyway. And for all these reasons I absolutely loved this book.How absolutely refreshing to read a good story with a great message. How remarkable to read a novel, a work of fiction that made me stop and think. How thoroughly thrilling to read a story that gave me hope and understanding at the same time I was entertained. This book is a monumental piece of work and the model for many more to come. I have continually recommended this book to many friends over the last few years.I am completely honored to have had my novel, ""the 100th human,"" put into the same category and to be compared to one of the pioneers in the field of ""factional"" novel writing."
5,I have one of the self-published versions...,"I was actually given the book by my father. My dad and I don't share the same reading list... but he really recommended I check this out. Wow! Don't read this like a well-written novel (it is not). Don't read this like it is the Bible (it is not). Read this like something a friend (me) recommended you take a look at. I think the ideas it presents are good for people to contemplate... I will not hold them up as brand new... but I think structure of the insights is healthy to think about. For me, it has been a very good experience through the easy read and I have never looked at coincidence the same. I don't hold this up as the best or worst book... just some good things to think about... that I obviously enjoyed."
2,The Hardy Boys and the Peruvian Prophesies,"Abridged Audio is to be avoided - though the premise of the Celestine Prophecy and the insights still hold an allure for this reader, who will get and read the book at some point (when I have lost the memory of this horrible audio). The Hardy Boy goes in search of the spiritual, chasing all over Peru, one step ahead of the evil Cardinal with lots of (rather inane) adventure along the way. Please be warned that the abridged audio is insultingly simplistic. The reader does well with the voices, but over-enunciates, and completely misses any emotion with a sing-song delivery (same tone to say ""United States of America"" as ""I was so frightened"")? The Celestine Meditations audio is absolutely lovely -- I never imagined I would be this disappointed."
4,A journey of the soul,"James Redfield uses this story to unveil the possibility of universal hope for all of humanity, through an ever increasing awareness of our self, others around us, and our natural world. He writes of special places where the energy which binds us all together is ever present, in sites such as mountains and old-growth forests. Have you ever felt a certain fondness for special places such as these?James also helps us understand the movement afoot in all corners of the globe, to raise our energy levels by being aware of what is truly happening to us all. He writes of the quantum leap which is necessary to create a unitive society of souls, dedicated to the proposition of establishing basic subsistence levels for all of humankind. It is through us our future depends."
5,Be inspired,"When I think about this book, I can say only one word: Inspiration. The characters, setting and plot combine to bring you into a place where you can learn deep spiritual insights. The insights are revealed one at a time and built upon each other.This is a must-read for the spiritually-minded. The insights are about transformation. So they are powerful.Another book you have to read is ""Nexus: A Neo Novel""--an inspiring story of personal transformation. If you have read these books and like them, then let others know about them. That way we can help to uplift the vibration of those around us."
3,thoughtful,"i agree with what many have already said. the celestine prophecy is terribly written, yet the ideas expressed inside are remarkable. i thank james redfield for a job well done."
2,simple reading,I read this book when it first came and and was disappointed then. Now reading it again I see how simple it really is compared to recent books I have read. Of course someone new to this area will be spell bound. It depends on your level I suppose.
1,painfully contrived,"I don't usually do fiction, but have picked up a few excellent reads in that category. This isn't one of the best. For those who prefer nonfiction, and who are seeking a concept of god they can live with in good concscience, check out God Without Relgion by Sankara Saranam."
5,Belongs in Everyone's Humor Collection,"As far as unintentinal hoots go, this is by far my favorite. The blurb writer above describes Jesse Conti's delivery perfectly: "" He reads in hushed, anticipatory tones, almost whispering the secrets of the prophesies."" What could be richer? He appears to naively believe that he is imparting some sort of actual wisdom, or is unravelling the mysteries of The Dead Sea Scrolls. All he is doing, in reality is sounding incredibly inept.There is no wisdom to be imparted here, soul fans! Not even the slightest intimation of an original concept. Regurgitated 60s mantra music, from the newly annointed guru of pop spiritualism. Redfield makes Richard Bach look positively profound, by comparison.If you want to find true spirituality between the bindings of a book, pick up the Bible, The Koran, The Bagghavad Ghita, The Upanishads, Siddhartha, Kalhil Gibran, C.S. Lewis, etc. If you want a good belly-laugh, order this tape.BEK"
1,Ambrosia for True Believers,"I'd like to call this thing ""tripe"" but tripe is something actually useful--you can make menudo with it. Garbage can be compacted and used to make...something. Using those standards, ""The Celestine Prophecy"" is of some use, too. It gives True Believers a mythos to base their impossible faith in.Ron Braithwaite"
5,The Celestine Prochecy,"Hi there. Awhile back, my friend told me to read this book. So I borrowed it. It was amazing. It changed my whole view on the world. What it speaks of is so totally true that it blew my mind. I suggest to anyone to read this book. Even if you may not be into the spiritial stuff. (If you aren't then why are you looking up this book?) Read it. I gurantee you'll enjoy it."
2,Blasphemy,"James Redfield attempts an untangible merger of Christianity and Buddhism in his novel, The Celestine Prohpecy. In promoting a linear path of understanging, an eastern philosophical strategy in itself, he advocates the Buddhist ethic of attaining spiritual enlightenment while on earth. Unfortunately, Redfield confuses and intermingles this with what he mistakenly understands as the true meaning of Christianity. Don't be fooled by his false interpretation."
5,AWESOME!,"""The Celestine Prophecy"" holds you in suspense from thebeginning to the end. You ask yourself over and over, ""Isthis real...is this book fact or fiction"". From the verybeginning I had a deep urge to head straight to Peru so Icould search for the insights too. I realized by the timeI finished this masterpiece, that there are no writteninsights to find...it is all within each and every one of us.The exciting thing is that if mankind would listen to theirinner selves and apply these insights to their own lives,we would live in an entirely different world. A world wherepeace, love, compassion and understanding reigns."
1,Reading this book is like chopping wood with a very dull-bladed axe. Painful.,"I read a co-worker's copy more than twenty years ago. If ""Half Star"" or ""No Star"" ratings were available, I would have picked ""No Star"".Reading this book is like chopping wood with a very dull-bladed axe. Painful.But as awkwardly as it is written, I recommend reading it (or trying to read it) just to experience it. Then for comparison read one of the short stories from James Joyce's The Dubliners to experience masterful writing."
3,Personal Evolution and Energy,"James and Sally Redfield believed in this book so much that they traveled across the country promoting it with their own money. They did the same with the movie.This is book with an awesome book about energy, trusting your Self and Personal Evolution. Read the book. Watch the Movie. It's a great message.Trudi"
4,"Makes you go, ""Hummmm...""","I really enjoyed the writing style of this book. It pulls you in and allows your imagination to flow. Although most of it is hard to believe, with an open mind you can pick out the lessons with ease."
1,Why I chose not to read this book,"Here is a query I put out to some friends through e-mail, and a response from a very intelligent person: [My question] > Okay so I just finished reading a really stupid book someone gave me. How irritating. What a waste of time. And that made me wonder about what each of you thinks is the worst book you have ever read. I mean, the very, very worst. [his answer] Oh, this is easy. ""The Celestine Prophecy."" The worst book I have ever, ever read, or ever hope (if hope is the right word) to read. Read for our book club a year or so ago, or I wouldn't have made it past page 10. The book's only redeeming value? When asked what is the worst book I ever read, I no longer have to cogitate or hesitate, I can say Celestine, without further reflection. DON'T READ THIS BOOK. Pray for our country that it and its sibling remain best sellers after all this time. Maybe no one else is actually reading it - that would be the best we could hope for"
1,Glad I only borrowed it,"As a result of reading the Prophecy, many people claiminspiration. I have a feeling though that these same people are theones revving the engines and inching forward into the intersectionat the red light. There are some good, albeit commonsense ideas here, but the ""adventure"", the writing and the characters are seriously disappointing."
2,The Celestine Profit,"I enjoyed the first few chapters of this book. The writing was fairat best, but the story moved quickly and made for fun lightreading. However, by the time I was finished with the fictionalaccount of a search for the manuscript I felt exploited by Mr.Redfield.My main objection to the Celestine Prophecy is the blatantattempt to ensure a sequel to the first book. A tenth insightcrops up on the last few pages. I believe that Redfield is in thisfor the money and is doing quite well, thank you. The bookalso has a rather simplistic outlook on our world. With humansat the top of the evolutionary heap and North Americanspiritual yuppies defining a ""better"" way for the world toexist."
1,WORST OF THE WORST,"I am a ""bookaholic"". I love to read and read almost anything but I can honestly say this is the only book I have never finished. Absolutely boring"
1,Might be a Five-Star Effort,"On the off chance this is actually a drawn-out, deliberately poorly written, send up of New Age drivel, it deserves five stars. Otherwise, let's give it one incandescent, Deepak Chopra, twinkle."
1,Atrocious,"This is one of the worst books I've ever read - a real struggle to finish due to its kindergarten plot, poor proof reading and hippy ""message"".No idea why its so popular - its like it was written by a 13 year old."
3,Okay,"My mate Derick recommended this book. He said it was good, so I bought it. Its okay. Its not great, it's just okay. Derick likes broccoli and peas, mind, which I don't like. So I suppose we have different tastes. Yes. That explains it."
4,The first spirutual book which i read fully.,This is the book with a proper blend of normal story and spiritual thinking.The script is well written which keeps you going on and on till you finish. I really enjoyed reading it. Some of the concepts explained in the book have already been implemented by certain Spiritual Healers Associations in India. It's worth a read.
1,A very dissapointing read.It was really quite awful,"I expected much more from this book. It was written in a very juvenile tone, and the story itself was quite bad. I could not even bring myself to finish the book, for it was torturous to read on."
1,Bad writing Bad Cheesy Plot Devices and Bad construction,"There are lots of problems with this book, but the fundamental problem is that it is supposed to be a worldwide phenomenon, but he uses only western Christian history to organize his thoughts. The history of the eastern world is completely different, and often several hundred years in advance of western civ."
4,ASH in Chicago - great start for spiritual guidance,"I found Redfield's book to be a fascinating look into the 21st century. It is time that all of us start uncovering the ""coincidences"" of the past and put them to good use in the future with our actions in the world and our view of the past. I found this book refreshing and intelligent. Those that reject the basic ideas presented by Redfield are not in touch with their spirituality or the enormous problems created by smothering world leaders. To say that this book should be accepted as the absolute truth would be silly. Anyone taking that stance has not even read the words on the pages of The Celestine Prophecy. It is an amazing book that opens our eyes to reaching out to others, nature and our own histories."
1,Unfortunately there isn't a negative star rating!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was the absolute worst book I have ever read in my life!!!!!! And I'm not even talking about the theme of the book here, which was almost impossible to be the least bit interested in because of the AWFUL writing style. I actually wound up skimming the last third of the book because I couldn't stand reading it anymore, but I wanted to see if somewhere in it's pages there was any validity to it's popularity. Needless to say, I didn't find any! It is a terribly written book. I can't imagine how it ever made it off of the editor's desk, or for that matter, I can't imagine an editor actually editing this, approving it for publication, and still having a job!!!! I certainly hope Mr. Redfield takes some of the royalties from this book and invests in an ""Introduction to Writing"" course. If you feel you need to read this book, try to at least borrow it from someone, don't waste your money!"
3,"Some good points, some barleywaggle.","I think the point to the plain writing style was to make this novel approachable to the masses. I don't know about energizing until I'm invisible, or having to pay for it for that matter, but I found what he says about dramas, dealing with people, and raising children interesting and applicable."
5,Great read,I love this book. Could not put it down once I started reading. I will read more of his books.
5,thanks!,This book was in excellent shape and it arrived in a very timely manner. Thanks for the good quality of service.
3,A spiritual philosophy within an adventure story,This book is a good read and leads you to a spiritual philosophy regarding energy transference and its morality. The book takes you into Peru where 9 manuscripts are lost. These manuscripts hold secret wisdoms for enlightenment and the plot allows the main characters to search for them one at a time. It is a peaceful story that has meaning and is well worth a read.
1,Save time - read the wikipedia instead,"My book club made me read it. We all hated it. The devout Christians in the club found it offensive. The agnostics found it flat and ""trying too hard."" The story was not the least bit compelling. Do yourself a favor and read the wikipedia entry instead."
3,"Not great, but okay.","It has it's good and bad points, but overall I'm glad I read it. It's a very easy read, Redfield is extremely simple and direct in his writing style. I thought the plot was very intriguing, but it got repetitive after the first few chapters. Some of the ""Insights"" are a bit New Age-y, but they did make me think and do a quick re-evaluation of the way I live. It didn't inspire a life-overhaul, but it did give little bits on wisdom of how to change my life for the better. I give it a 3.5."
5,Insights in CP helped me,"I liked the Celestine Prophesy because of how the story contains metaphysical concepts integrated into an adventure story. The concepts presented in this book helped me to remember energies and placed a decent picture in my mind's eye of how I was handling my own energies.I used the picture and the knowledge presented to me in my near death experience to achieve a paradigm shift of my own. Reading the Celestine Prophesy inspired me to write about my NDE and eventually write a book (Soul Bared: A Metaphysical Journey"")"
2,"A Must Read, but...","Here's the thing... Celestine Prophecy was a brilliant start, a hope for some spiritual change in the world. However, what came after is the disappointment, more Redfield books, just cranking them out... it's degenerating into self-help, not world change, and in that you won't be able to take much pleasure.You should buy this book and read it just for the bravery of it's creation, but then again you'll only be sad in the long run that nothing has really come of it."
1,Real reasons not to read this book:,"I consider myself open-minded. I welcome comments from anyone who disagrees with my review.I would discourage anyone from reading this book because:1. If you want fiction, this book lacks style and character.2. If you want insight (spiritual or otherwise), this book offers no basis for it's ""revelations.""The author will tell you energy is concentrated on mountaintops, and our auras can connect with flowers to help them grow, and we can achieve such a high state of being we will become invisible to those of lesser intelligence. Well, that sounds nice.But he offers no basis for these ideas, so why would anyone take them seriously? We may as well believe in hobbits and unicorns. They sound nice, too."
1,Don't do it! No! Don't!,"This has got to be one of the worst books I've read. I think he needs to leave the writing to a professional and start a new age cult of his own--old ideas rehashed once again. How many times can the main character say ""I don't know."" or ""I guess."" or ""yeah."" ??? Just a sample of the stimulating dialogue you'll encounter in this book! By the way,the ""Mayan"" better known as the MAYA didn't live in Peru...doing some research would have been a good idea."
4,"So what color are energy fields, anyway?","Everyone I've heard of that's read The Celestine Prophecy either loves it or hates it. Personally, I am on firm middle ground. While I found the amateurish storytelling trite and distracting, I thoroughly enjoyed the content. I can't see energy fields or travel to Peru, but the Insights did make me realize a few things about myself and my interactions with others. It made a very strong impression on me--and isn't that the mark of a good book? I passed it around to my friends (we refer to it as ""the Book"") and they had positive reactions as well. One friend actually can see the energy fields. Perhaps he is more enlightened than I, but regardless, The Celestine Prophecy had the power to make me think, answer some serious questions about myself, and provided an interesting theory about some of the worldwide changes we see today. Critics may call it ""New Age BS"" but I consider it worth the several classes I skipped to read. I do encourage everyone to read it."
3,"Don't take it too seriously, have fun with it!","I heard much about this book before actually reading it. On the one hand, some said it was a masterpiece, others said it was pulp fiction, and not even very good at that. It was an easy read. It had a certain Indiana Jones/Tomb Raider type of feel to it, focusing on the hunt/search for a mystical artifact (or in this case manuscript) before the enemy finds it. I'm sure this book would translate into an entertaining movie! The pseudo-spirituality I could have done without, and I see how/why many would take it almost literally (like they do the bible). There are staunch, environmentalist themes depicted in this book, which greatly appealed to me. If you are looking for your soul's salvation, arcane knowledge or some divine inspiration, you're kidding yourself. This is a fun adventure book: nothing more, nothing less. Have fun reading it!"
1,I don't think so,"Great conceptual idea spoiled by inept writing and storyline. The book is based on the well meaning ""consciousness revolution"" and the Vedic sciences, and then proceeds to turn them into a joke. Each ""insight"" becomes more and more ridiculous (especially at how easily they are grasped by even the youngest of characters), and the reader is insulted time and again with the dumbed-down writing of Mr Redfield. His ultimate ""prediction"" of the future is perhaps the biggest joke of all. If you are a serious student of consciousness do yourself a favor and skip this read."
2,Interesting self-help book made into a lousy novel,"""The Celestine Prophecy"" is filled with interesting spritual insights about life, and might have made a fine teaching book for seekers. However, the book is presented to us in the form of a novel, and thus, alas, asks to be reviewed on the grounds of one. As a novel, this is a stinker: an implausible adventure story about some guy flying all over the jungle on a whim, trying to find out various ""insights"" and illustrate them with his adventures. As I say, the insights themselves are interesting and may prove valuable to readers, but the story they get crammed into is an albatross."
1,Pretty bad writing,"This is poorly written as fiction. As a vehicle to convey a spiritual concept, it is also flawed and uninteresting. The author probably has some background in psychology and psycotherapy, and has done some reading on Eastern philosophies and mysticism, but it is clear that he didn't understand what Orientals mean by meditation and energy. It might have been better if the book has more plot and character development. As it is, this is just New Age, self-help material for cultists."
5,"Not literature, but phylosophy","I agree this book is not the greatest literature ever, in fact the story is not very good. But this book is not about reading and understanding it's story, but about comprehending the phylosophy behind it and trying to incorporate the message of the book into our everyday lives. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend it. As a very active book, you'll be able to find many relations between the book and your personal life. Learn from it, and it will be invaluable. It definitely changed my perspective of life in some way, for good. But just remember, extremism is bad, don't take it too seriously. Hope you enjoy it."
1,Tried hard to find gems hidden in the bad writing ...,".. but failed. Someone who writes (or speaks) unskilfully doesn't automatically mean he has nothing valuable to tell.I tried putting aside that logic demanding brain. I tried reminding myself that higher realities don't yield well to the mechanistic way we've been trained to think. Still nothing, but a saddening feeling that great masses of people had been swindled by this valueless book.I used the same attitude when I began reading Jeremy Griffith's badly written ""Beyond the Human Condition"", and, yes, I found something there. Griffith spent many years (six?) in the Tasmanian wilderness, but NOT to find ""meaning of life"". The clues (or the answers) about our existence came to Jeremy Griffith without invitation. I believe he'd been doing government commissioned research work at the time.I wouldn't recommend Griffith for those who disliked or liked ""Prophecy"". If someone insisted on a recommendation, I'd put forward ""The Prophet"" by Kahlil Gibran."
1,Celestine Prophecy: Or How I Lost My Faith in Humanity,"All James Redfield teaches us in this book is that he has a very poor understanding of evolution, history, human nature, religion, and most of all, literacy.Besides being filled with nothing worth taking away, Redfield has accomplished writing the most poorly written work of fiction I have ever read.This book's immense popularity and following among the ""new age"" crowd is proof enough that we are damned as a species."
3,For What It's Worth,"I read both the Celestine Prophecy and The Tenth Insight. I thought Celestine Prophecy told an interesting adventure with a hint of good advice. I knew it was a novel and read it as such. Unfortunately, I read these books after I read a book by Ray Fraser called Family of Angels. There is some similarities in the fact that both books call upon supernatural understanding, but Family of Angels was gripping. I literally could not put it down. I wish I had read The Celestine Prophecy when it first came out. I might have enjoyed it more."
3,Fun adventure,I enjoyed this book. It is a great first book for a person just starting a spiritual journey. The story is fun and easy and makes you start thinking differently about life. You start to understand things differently. Another book I would recommend is The Lost Teachings of Atlantis by Jon Peniel. It goes into a much deeper detail about life and is a perfect complement to the Celestine Prophecy.
5,Excellent,I have really enjoyed this book. I would like to know if it is possible to get any of the Celestine Prophecy books by James Redfield in Greek. Please help. Thanks
1,Gives me Hope,"Hope that I can make it as an author, if this guy can. This book is simply stupid, and its success is a rather sad commentary on humanity. The dialog is laughable, the plot an inch thin."
1,prophecy for fools,"I started reading this book with a very open mind. I mean, doesn't anyone want to be told what the true meaning of life is; why we are all here? And I must admit, although skeptical of the first insight, I was quite impressed by the second and even started telling people about the book. But it went all the way downhill from there. In trying to reconcile science and religion, Redfield has completely taken away the complexities of the world and stereotyped and categorized anything and everything. Sorry mister - it doesn't work that way. Are you truly trying to make us believe that all of mankind fits into only 4 groups of control drama? And is it so easy to define one based on the groups of your parents? come on - who are we trying to kid? The protagonist might fit easily into one of your molds but the rest of us like to think we have more depth. I'm all for a new world culture but the one offered in the Celestine Prophecy just isn't the way. Stay away from this book please!!"
2,Message? What message? How about common sense!,"After reading this book, I now see the message. Unfortunatley, I purchased the book therefore the message has come a little too late. This lame excuse for writing is at least pathetic. This story seems to drone on and on, and let's not forget to point out the repeated phrases which seem to make up most of the text. Ugh! I feel cheated. Perhaps the lesson here is, don't judge a book by it's cover. I did. I lost. If you want a good book which lets you make up your mind, read ""Holy blood, holy grail"". Not this one."
3,Emotional reviews really the story,"There was a story and then there was input. It was for each reader to decipher. However, the reviews written concerning the emotions as hindsight really is the story. The question is, what did this book spark in the nature of human consciousness which rumbled so loudly? It renders itself truly as a divide within the core of thinking."
2,Another how to reach enlightenment book for yuppies,"Ok fiction. But nothing new. This book is for people who are to lazy to read Plato, BF Skinner, the Torah,Koran,the Gitas, the New Testement and any other serious book on religion and/or philosophy. Take a bit of EST, add a pinch of Hinduim/Buddism/and what ever ism you like and you have this cute unoriginal concept for people with out original thoughts. The Tom Peters of pop culture."
2,"If you are looking for a philosophy, may I suggest the Bible","I know this book is appealing. I know that the language of forgiveness is appealing. I know that it is wonderful that the book inspires so many people to become more spiritual.But the hard facts are, this book is not the Bible, even though it *seems* to take up where the Bible left off. The Bible is complete, and as a book of philosophy, I have yet to find its equal.I am not a crusading Christian. This isn't about whether your religion is better or worse than mine. This is about people believing, and reforming their lives because of, this book. That is a dangerous practice to be part of, especially for those who are unaware of the differences between what this book professes and what the major world religions hold to be fundamental principles.Check it out for yourself. The Bible really doesn't need elaboration."
4,Go Well Together With Dream Maker,"I just bought the Celestine prophesy as it was being offered yogether with Dream Maker: A Mystical Tale, and I am so glad I bought both of these books.It's true what they say about the Celestine Prophesy, it has some flaws that some might consider funny, but I think the book is quite good and has many good points that have helped me. I found inspiration in the Nine Insights and if we only open our eyes we can see life's purpose. But I must admit that I found Dream Maker to be a better book. It has more substance and it really does open your mind to the purpose of life. It told me a lot of God's will, that it really resides within us, and until we learn who we really are we are going to be in pain. I have been also fighting depression, and reading Dream Maker helped me a lot. I am now more interested in reincarnation.I'm glad Amazon is pairing up these two novels, I hope many people buy them both."
3,Interesting but not inspired,"I found this book at a libray book sale and picked it up for all the hype I heard about it back in the nineties. What I found was a modestly entertaining little adventure purported to be a parable explaining the next step in our spiritual evolution. Basically Redfield explains God, the Bible, coincidence, and providence through the lens of Eastern mysticism and a New Age worldview ala Indiana Jones or Romancing the Stone.Read the Celestine Prophecy to get a glimpse of what some people think of as reality or read it if you have some time to kill, but do not read this for ""insights"" into spiritual reality. For that I recommend the Bible."
3,"Good , helpful Insights","I just re-read this book after some ten years, and I can understand why I thought it was so good back then. For a lost teenager, the insights were spiritual fodder, wrapped in an entertaining package.Today, I view the novel as simplistic, but also hold that the insights are still valuable for seekers taking their first tentative steps into spirituality. Those who want to go to the next level, look up ""Dream Maker"" by Grigor Fedan."
4,Just enough to keep me reading,"The Celestine Prophecy is a book that needs to have a second look. When I first picked up the book it took me a while to orientate with the materiel. I do have to agree with past reviewers, Redfield's writing is rough around the edges. However I soon found out that the plot and sub-plop were just enough to keep me reading to the next page. This book does pose some very fascinating questions and also answers some questions with enough class that many other book's in this genre miss.Although I found many questions after reading this book, I also found that it was a very easy read, and found myself filled after reading it."
1,Thank you Celestine Prophecy,The only thing good about this book is it inspired me to try to bang out a cheap novel and be able to get it published. Hey if this guy can do it. so can I!
1,"Stupid, stinky, ridiculous and poorly written.","What a piece of dog doo. It is absolutely beyond me why this book is so popular. Who is the main character? Wouldn't it help to have a name for the narrator of the story, James? This book would be flunked by any English teacher in any college in the country. The stiff and lifeless dialogue will put anyone to sleep - as it did me, night after night. In fact, the piece of garbage is still on by bedside table. I'm just waiting for the next power outage so I can use it for kindling."
4,Thought provoking and enriching,"I believe that in order to grow spiritually and mentally, we must be open to explore new and different ideas. In my attempt to find truth, I have found that I am ultimately free to pick and choose what I want to believe. By challenging my belief system and continually testing my ideas, I am able to build a strong foundation for a lifetime of learning and exploring. I have always chosen to learn some lesson or take some fragment of truth from what I read. I believe Mr. Redfield provides good food for thought. I for one enjoyed The Celestine Prophecy and will encourage others to read and grow from this material."
2,"A decent book, same old hypocrisy","The story line of the book was decent, but Redfield prowls on people who are desparately looking for answers without wanting to find them themselves. Here is a clue: if Redfield talks about saving the planet why does he participate in the process which is killing 19 million trees a day. Redfield is worthless in the shift of our humanity to search for truth without wanting to make money from it? From a sincere truth seeker, you are a dissapointment, Redfield. Don't buy this book unless you are thoughtless. Rent it from a friend, instead."
4,eye opening,"I grew up with a loving christian background and as I got a bit older, I started to experiment.I didn't really focus on my spirituality. This book came to me through a friend and tied up a lot of loose ends for me. It allowed me to see how what I felt related to what I had been taught. Not everything will apply to all, but I have nothing but good feelings about this book. I have had many similar experiences as described in this book. Don't take everything to heart, just what you might need. Strive to be positve."
1,Celestine Hypocrasy,"Upon reading this tripe when it originally came out, I wondered why I spent the time. Actually I wondered why I hadn't spent the time writing a book myself, for I, too would surely like to be rich. I had always stopped myself for not feeling quite ready to write. Well, that didn't stop this courageous bozo from collecting his money, did it? Anyway, I write here now only to praise my fellow-reviewers. Your comments are worth having shared the terrible experience of reading this dribble. I also take a small amount of glee in joining in to bring down the rating of this ""book"". Of course this ""author"" is laughing all the way to the bank. So? Let him. I agree, though, that he should stop killing trees and also stop pumping up egos. I think I'll re-read my Nancy Drew series. It was a far, far better dose of transport."
5,The Book of Life,"I love this book because I have experienced every single insight in the book and more. As for the ""coicidences"" they are not. I wrote a speech about spirituality and the night before I had to give the speech, I picked up the book which I had had in my posession for a whole year and had never touched. I didn't even know what the book was about. It was given to me on my birthday by a friend of mine. And when I started reading it, it explained eveything my speech was about in a detailed systematic manner. I added that as my final ""coincidence"" on my speech. All we are given is the ability to look back and reflect. If you do that, I'm sure you'll realise that everything that has happened to you has happened for a reason and has made you the person that you are today. After reading this book you can take on the future with a whole new aproach."
1,"Very Humanistic, lacks true spirituality Not believable Fic","If you are looking for true spiituality you won't find it here. If your looking for a good fiction you wont find it believable. This book teaches the same basic principles every other humanist does. That we don't need anyones help to reach God. That we can pull ourselves up by our bootstraps into a spiritual realm through concentration. The way to Heaven is through Jesus Christ. He broke down all barriers between God & man. Throug Christ we have all the ""energy"" we will ever need and without him you can never know his power. If you are an atheist, tree worshipping vegetarian you'll love this book."
1,Wow......(spoken in disgust),"This was possibly the most poorly-written book I have ever read. It has no plot. Once in a while people move around, but that is just to briefly separate the ""miraculous insights"" from one another. The only way I can see giving this book any credit is if you actually BELIEVE the trash that this guy is preaching. He might as well drop the whole action/suspense portion of the book (about 20 pages) and just call it ""Religion according to yet another new-age nutcase."" I mean, I would be hard-pressed to find another book so poorly written (Try ""The Death Disciple"". It's almost as bad.) Anyways, please don't read this book. It's not even worth one star. I actually would have given it a negative star, but that's not possible."
4,"Not for everyone,but of benifit to some","I enjoyed reading this book. I don't agree with all the ideas in the book,but some things fit situations in my life at this time. I thought the story was interesting and well written. I feel this book is not for everyone although most will enjoy it. I would suggest this book to anyone that needs a little explanation for some of the occurences in their life."
1,A Disappointment,"After hearing so much about this book, I expected more. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. There is nothing really new and enlightening here and as a novel, the book is really pathetic. So why all the hype? The good thing this book did was open up a new category in fiction. There are many better ""visionary"" books out there with true insights and intriguing stories. For example, ""The Destiny of Miro"" which is a much better book and one I would highly recommend over this best seller."
1,a shocker,"I bought a copy of this book to see what all the hype was about, and after forcing myself to finish it, I have no idea. The writing is bad, the science and the geography are wrong, and it's a whole lot of new-age, quasi-spiritual stuff mixed in a ludicrous plot. Of course the marketing was clever, with the publisher successfully exploiting the general unease of city people near the end of the 20th century. It is basically a book written for people who usually read bestsellers who want to go for something more 'serious' or 'spiritual.' If you are not one of those, don't waste your time and money."
3,"A yard wide, an inch deep!","I read this book as comedy, really. Its super thin plot line and character development left me laughing out loud at times with quips such as ""who would have murdered the doctor?"", answer: ""I think it must have been an enemy!"" It left me wondering how come these super smart Phd professor types who travel to Peru on a whim can't understand Spanish? Must have missed that part of their extensive education! Lost count of how many times charcters were ""gazed intently"" at! I read this book because my daughter and son in law are into it and wanted my input. I suppose it will make a good cash-cow mindlessly new-ager movie. Nonetheless, I enjoyed this read, as comedic FICTION baby!"
3,The book cover does not resemble as advertised.,Even though the content of the book will always be the same ... but sometimes buyers would like to have a different book cover if available from various edition/publishing. It would be lovely if the book being sold would resemble the book cover image that was advertised here in Amazon.com.
1,This book is HORRIBLE,"This book redefines bad. The author, James Redfield, writes as though he had just graduated from grade 2! How many times does he have to use the word 'intense'? Everyone looks at him 'intensely'. The main character is utterly shocked and surprised by even the most predictable scenarios - in short, he is a total moron, just like anyone who enjoys this book. Possibly the worst literary achievement of this decade - and that says something for the millions of people who love this book"
1,Couldn't read past the first few pages.,"One of most memorably horrible books I've ever read (well, actually TRIED to read, as I couldn't make myself finish it). I kept thinking it was some sort of joke, which I guess it was. Like many here I thought this book must have some kind of merit, but it doesn't. It's an embarrasment to the literary community and to humanity in general."
1,Worthless,"This work is like most new age books, it is shallow and intended to be understood by persons of a fifth grade intellect. This book is indeed a front for Scientoloy, a criminal organization that is far removed from the cause of peace and exists for the sole purpose of leaching precious resources of the desparate and infirm. It is truly sad that so many Americans find value in this book. If you find value in the christian or jewish bible, you will find value in this book as well. In its essence, it means nothing but its ambiguity allows for imagination to fill in the gaps. If you are tired of faith based religions, this book is no different..."
5,Refreshing,"This book was a very interesting and refreshing read. It's the kind of book that will make you sit back and look at your life from new angles. This is always a good thing to do every now and again!I'm also an author of the book Woman Vs Womaniser 'This is the Book Men Do not Want Women to read'. [...] Readers have also said my book makes them look at their own lives, and that the book inspired them. Which was my plan from the begging! So I can really relate to this book. I think it's a great read."
1,Nothing New Under The Sun,this is making a nice edition to my heresy library. all this new age spirituality is satanically inspired doctrines of demons. there is an eternally horrible price to pay for believing you are god. same lie as in the garden of eden except wrapped in a big shiney new age bow.I will be suprised if this doesn't make Oprah-won-kenobi's book club.
1,...,"Couldn't even get past the third chapter before throwing this book against a wall. The writing style is atrocious, a narrative that only 3rd graders might be able to appreciate. I'm disappointed, because I'm sure the message is a valid one, but I can't get past this awful, see-through story telling technique in order to get to it!"
1,Don't waste your time,"This book was our book club selection this month. Yes, late in the game, I know. In any event, I had many reservations before I read it...I mean, if I had wanted to read this book, I would have read it when it was first published. Most of my friends thought it was complete rubbish, but I bit the bullet and decided to read it for myself and decide. Well, as a novel it sucks, and as a religion/philosphy, it's weak at best. It reads like a self-help book that has been written as a novel. Honestly, read some of the reviews you'll find on google and that will be plenty...no need to waste your time or money on reading the real thing."
2,Boring,"I read this book because of friend of mine suggested it was a great read. Based on the title I had no idea it was fiction.I quickly figured that out during the first chapter and just adjusted my frame of mind.The conversations that take place are hard to read because they are so overly descriptive and the characters drone on and on. The main character still doesn't seem to grasp any of these insights and comes across as an idiot.Ugh, It took me over two weeks to read this becuase I had to force myself to pick it up.I don't understand why it is such popular book but I certainly do not recommend you waste your time."
1,What is all the fuss about?,"I really don't understand the popularity of this book and the whole line of books and products it has inspired. It is a poorly written novel and the spiritual ideas are elementary. Everything is sooo easy in this book. Hey, maybe that is why it sells so well. If you are interested in a real novel about a real spiritual quest with real spiritual ideas, check out ""The Destiny of Miro"" by Julie Rae Rickard. Not only is it a much better book, it doesn't tell you what to think. It presents ideas and you are left to find/make your own answers/conclusions."
3,Reactions are Strong - and varied - to this book,"I read this ages ago, probably when it first came out. Since then I have heard much about it - and read some reviews on it in Amazon.com. I find that people either condemn it, and the people who get something out of it; or love it, and think it is the answer. From my own experience, this book somehow manages to interest and sooth, when a person is in need. That is the only way I can explain its popularity. Objectively, no, its not a riveting plot, nor are the ideas world-changing, and I can understand people who are not in a vulnerable state scorning it as ""new-age mumbo-jumbo""; but I think they should realise - and respect - that others may find it useful."
3,The Celestine Prophecy,"This book is a classic. It is not very intellectual, nor very intricately written. At times, it seems like it is written as a train of thought. But, that makes it real. Celestine Prophecy draws the reader in, eliciting agreement and anticipation of how we will apply the concepts to our own lives. It becomes a little predictable, and even a little bit boring, but there are a few ""ah-hahs"", as we realize that what we have been thinking has just been put into words - simply and understandably.Spirit Journeys: Freeing the Soul in this Life and Beyond,Healing Thoughts: Applying Therapeutic Shamanism in Your Daily Life"
5,Celestine Prophecy,"I found this to be an excellent book!!! I do think it is a beginner book, but then again, that's when I read this book, was at the beginning of my journey. It allowed me to see other aspects of the world that I had never contemplated before. At the time, had I ready anything too much more intense, I would have been lost. Many of the reviwers bash this book, but at what point did they decide to read it? If taken in at the beginning, I think this book will be one of the most beneficial to start with. Read later on, it would offer nothing new and would probably bore you. I think it's an excellent book, with a lot offer, and would recommend it to anyone."
4,Alright book,The book is alright. yeah it's kinda dry and the grammar is bad etc. But it has a moral point to it. I just think it's funny that people take this book so seriously. It's fiction not real life. It's a book to read and enjoy. The author had a lot of good visuals.
4,You'll get out of it what you allow yourself to put into it.,"Perhaps one of the most interesting aspects of this book isthe ability of the author to induce such animosity of hisparticular writing style by his readers. It seems to me thatthe particular style was chosen because the author felt thatthe content (not the method of presentation) was important.Clearly, if the author had chosen a more complicated style, thesize of the potential audience would have been severely reduced.A self-reflective reader will probably not be as impressed withthe actual prophesy at the superficial level; however, few indeedcan walk away without gaining something if they read carefully.Remember that in litterature (as in life), the simplicity orcomplexity of one aspect has little to do with the whole.Moreover, if you think there was nothing to gain from an experience,then you've probably missed the point. Chris Thoburn"
2,"Nice idea, no character development, needed a serious author","Great ideas, could have been a great book with a better, more serious & dedicated author. Seems like he had this cool idea & threw together a story around it to get the book out as quick as possible. Guess he succeeded in doing that & making his money, good for him. Seems like very little research (if any) went into this ""work"". Zero character development, I felt no connection whatsoever to any of them. After 50 pages I was bored & just wanted to see what the nine insights were."
1,The Celestine Proph...zzzzzzz...,"I tried. I really tried to like The Celestine Prophecy. Unfortunately, I almost couldn't finish it. I kept falling asleep. This had much to do with the style itself, which is amateurish and lifeless. As for the premise, well...perhaps it has to do with the bad writing, but I was left with the feeling that Redfield had a drug-induced spiritual/life vision, and felt the best way to share it with the public (i.e.: cash in) was via novelization. In truth, the Celestine Prophecy may have been sincerely written, but I found it tedious, sophmoric, and staggeringly shallow. I'd strongly suggest looking for a different book if you seek genuine and deep spiritual enlightenment."
3,"Useful introduction, but somewhat immature and repetitive","This book is a good introduction to Jungian psychology, cosmic evolution, and mystical awareness. The writing is perhaps immature and repetative. There is also, I believe, a technical flaw in the premise that increased molecular vibrations cause bodies (i.e. matter) to become lighter. If anything, increased vibrational energy on the molecular level implies higher temperature, and on the subatomic level, greater mass. For those interested in a treatment consistant with our present state of scientific knowledge I would recommend 'The Pharaoh's Son' by Michael J. Dahl."
5,Extremely Interesting,"I just read this book and contrary to what many people think I found it to be very enlightening. I am a teenager and have been reading books on spirituality for the past year or so. For me this has been a very good start for me. It provided a new way for me to look a things, put the world in a different perspective. Although this book might not be particularly interesting for some people it is a good book for anyone who is beginning their spiritual journey. If you unsure where to start this book is very informative and isn't a boring read at all."
3,Insightful Yet Elementary,"As you may have read, this book does offer some useful insights into one's life. However, there is a catch 22 apparent with the reading of this literary ""masterpiece"". The concepts are something which appeal to a more mature crowd, however the writing itself (the story) seems as if it were submitted by a 13 yr old who won a writing contest. There is no development of characters, the story constantly makes ridiculous jumps in plot, almost to the point that it hardly flows as one story at all (the only thing held equal is the main character and his ""quest"").I gave this story two stars because I had to fight through it, however, the philosophies found with in are worth giving critical thought. If you find this book for $5 or it is given to you, by all means read it, but do not expect more than what I have said because you will not find it. If you do not trust me, read it and see for yourself."
5,Why the Celestine Prophecy is a wonderful novel,"So I've read a lot of the reviews on this site, and I must say I'm completely shocked at how low the star ratings are. I'm not even going to go into why I love this book, I'm just want to explain why those low star rated reviews are rubbish. Just looking at the statistcs on this book you can see how loved and important this novel is. Since 1993 The Celestine Prophecy has sold over 20 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 34 languages..You just don't sell that many copies of a book if it's not good! Also for the people that didn't like the way this book was written, I have to agree with you that Redfield is not master novelist but that's not the point of the book. The point is for him to get a across a message, to everyone. I was 13 when I first read this book. The lanuage is designed so that everyone can understand its message."
2,New Age Fecal Matter,"The only thing more annoying about this book than its freshman (in high school that is) level writing is its message of nearly divine self-centeredness. Basically, the world revolves around each and every reader, which seems hard to swallow...how can there be millions of centers of the universe? Actually, that's not even the most annoying thing. There's no parking lot at Machu Pichu. The Maya were never in South America. Not everyone in Peru speaks English. I could go on, and on...and on, the point is the author basically just laid waste to fact after fact about the real world. I did give the book two stars rather than none because I liked a couple of the insights, though most made me cringe."
1,Pure New Age Pop Culture garbage!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Borrow it from your local library. I did, thankfully. It is so bad that its great sales success is unbelievable. It actually saddens me to think that so many people can take this garbage seriously. The writing style is stiff, the characters unidimensional. The pop philosophy layed down is a combination of ""a little bit of this, a little bit of that"", freely gleaning ideas from Sixties Eastern Religion movements, EST, astrology-like tenets, etc., etc."
1,Just awful!,"I have now expunged the words energy, evolution and beauty from my vocabulary. If I had the author's address, I would send him a thesaurus. Such lifeless writing. Such lifeless characters. Shame on the editor!"
3,An ok read,"This book was recommended to me by a friend who read this book after a close relative's death. She said that it helped her resolve some issues and come to terms with things. Based on that and other reviews I read, I was expecting this to be an amazing, life altering read. What i found was a somewhat interesting storyline with some interesting ideas to ponder (involving your view of the world, reflections on coincidences, family dynamics, and how different people react to specific personalty types. There were some worthwhile points, but nothing I couldn't have read in one of Dr. Phil's books. Not life altering by far, as others have stated."
3,Fluffy but fairly interesting,"If you're looking for true revelations or that great flash of insight, this is not the book for you, but if you're looking for a light, fictional account of one person's quest for knowledge, without too much fuss, this is gentle, easy reading with a few g rated chase scenes tossed in for good measure.I would read more just to see how far the ""prophecy"" would go, but I would read it in the tone of reading a Star Trek fan story."
3,Must read but only because of the sequel,"This book for an assignment so there was nothing in particular that drew me to pick it up and read. It details nine ""insignts"" and how they are important to your purpose of life. Mainly that there is no such thing as coincidence. If it happens, it happens for a reason and you should find out why. Overall entertaining as a fiction, but might leave you with something more.I found the Tenth Insight better, but you have to reat this one before you can understand the others."
1,Possibly the worst book I've ever read....ever!,"I take no issue with the content of the book, but rather the weak story and lame writing style. It's a little too convenient that *everyone* met in Peru speaks perfect English. The tone, word choice, and style read more like a college term paper in ""creative writing"" than an actual book worthy of print and sale. I'm shocked this thing made it to print and the editor didn't laugh the manuscript out of their office."
1,"poor story developement, stilted writing","Since I only paid$.75 for this book, I didn't feel I was cheated out of any money. But I certainly felt I was cheated out of what could have been a very good story. I was not taken on a journey at all, inwardly or outwardly. Instead I just plodded along this book's path with no satisfaction to be found. It could have been a truly uplifting, insightful trip in the hands of a more elegant writer. I truly don't understand how this made it to any best seller list for any length of time."
2,Not for me,"I read the book long time ago and until I read the comments from all the readers I thought I was the only person in the world that didn't like The Celestine Prophecy.There is a lot of people interested in spiritual things and I am too, but this book was not about it at all.Redfield writes about ""revelations"" but he doesn't know what is he talking about, it is just too easy, there are not insights, not real learning process. I had this sense of ""fake spirituality"", impossible to believe in."
1,Burn it!,"This book belongs in a fireplace, not on a bookshelf. This is such a load of rubbish I can't believe it was ever published. Of course, in the US, anything is possible. I haven't read anything this bad since that Mars-Venus garbage written by an idiot matching Redfield's calibre.There are a great deal of good books written that deal with spiritual life, synchronicity, prayer, and metaphysics, but this crap makes a mockery of such knowledge.The hysteria around the Celestine Prophecy reminds me very much of the HC Andersen story The Emperor's New Clothes. For a long time I thought that I was the only sane person around who could see that James Redfield was a total moron. I guess that if you tell a big enough lie to enough people, people start to believe it. It seems that enough people believed that this was a good book to make it a national bestseller.If it's any consolation, this book is topping the charts in Sweden as well. Ugh! I think I'll move to Poland."
1,I wish he had been to Peru!,"I found the book to be awful in so many ways but am happy for those who found it inspirational. As a recent tourist to Peru I bought the book hoping to learn more about the country that I had visited and loved - or at least to relive some of my experiences. However, what I found was not just a grossly inadequate description of a magical country but the description of a country that did not exist. R had clearly not seen, or even read much about the places he describes. The roads to Machu Picchu and Iquitos thankfully do not exist. In fact you cannot drive to Iquitos at all. That is one of the fascinating features of this isolated city, cut off by tremendous water ways, mountains and jungle. You cannot drive to Machu Picchu and look down on the ruins. My expeditions in Peru changed my life, this book did not. Very disappointing."
1,"Not only could I put it down, I couldn't pick it up again.","This book didn't even have the decency to make me hate it. I gave up out of boredom soon after getting to the third ""revelation"" and have already forgotten what that was, and also revelation number two. I only remember the first one (something along the lines of ""people will start to notice lots of really weird coincidences"") because I felt the author was setting himself up with an excuse for not bothering with a convincing plot development. I read a great many books, and would guess that I finish about 99% of books I start, even though this often requires considerable perseverence. Well, this one made that exclusive 1%. For those who feel this book has some deep message, I think you'd get more out of hugging a tree."
2,A Low-Energy Farce.,"Thin message. Thinner plot. And just think, folks, they're actually going to make a TV movie of this drivel! While some of the philosophies explored are interesting, the plot was so ludicrous that I laughed out loud in spots. This is new-age psychobabble at its worst!"
2,Crackpot pseudoscience,"See page 97 for Redfield's lyrically written insight into how he can see a quarter moon on his side of the earth while folks on the other side of the earth see a full moon. You'd think that someone who believes in astrology would at least get his basic astronomy right, but I suppose nonsense begets nonsense."
5,Excellent,"This book is an excellent depiction of spirituality. Although the book is fiction, it has some serious and meaningful real life implications."
4,Very entertaining and thought provoking,"First, this book is an adventure parable, which means it's not true to fact. It's well written and easy to understand. I totally enjoyed the book so much that I had a hard time putting it down. This was a fun, thought-provoking, and easy read. I would recommend this book to anyone that is beginning their spiritual journey. Another interesting, must-read is Power vs. Force by David Hawkins. After reading these two, you really look at life a bit differently."
3,good point; bad vehicle,"I have not completed the book as of yet and decided to check out some thoughts from other readers. I do think the book offers food for thought, especially if you are looking for a little more out of life than the hum-drum, day to day same old. My complaint is that the actual presentation of the material is done poorly. I want to know what this person's philosophy is and possibly some back-up; i don't want to read a sci-fi, action thriller. I found myself taking rest from the book at points where the fictional story seemed more impotant than the theory and idea."
1,Dreadfull,"This book is a poorly written mish-mash of cheap fiction and misused 'scientific' concepts. Not only could I not finish reading it because of nausea, but I also threw it in the trash..."
1,New Age mind candy par excellence.,Mr Redfield has succeeded in giving the smug intellectual and yuppie crowd the kind of mind candy upon which they thrive. His book steps in to fill the void formerly occupied by common sense and religious conviction in the lives of the above mentioned group.He is to be commended for writing an entertaining book. One should not take it for more than what it is. An adventure story.F. Laureano
5,The Celestine Prophesy/The Tenth Insight,I have a compellation of both works in one book. The messages that I received from this book were both inspiring and life changing. I have read this book three times and I get a better understanding of life every time I read it again. If you are one who is seeking spiritual guidance and a positive force within your life I highly recommend that you start with this book. I have awakened unto a new spiritual self and awareness. I have learned how to hold on to my visions and it has helped me learn how to impove the quality of life through myself and with the help of others.
1,"6,000,000 copies sold! And it's still crap!","""The Celestine Prophecy"" is so poorly written, I would have been embarassed to be identified as the author. If Redfield's ideas are so vital, original, and important, why couldn't he at least have hired a ghostwriter to come in and clean up his abysmal mess of a manuscript? The ideas themselves are a salad-bar mishmash of various New-Age and pseudo-Eastern sputterings, all of which I've seen before. My six-year-old niece has made finger puppets out of construction paper that have more depth of character than Redfield's stick-figures. It's simply horrid. ""New-Age Half-Baked Rampantly-Eclectic Spirituality for Dummies"", it should be called--or, better yet, ""Watery Gruel for the Soul""!"
1,Absolute Garbage,"The Celestine Prophecy parades itself as a book of spiritual enlightenment when it is nothing more than maudlin pomp that should make even the new age audience it's aimed at turn up their noses. Not only is the subject matter light weight and transparent, the book is written in so poorly with language and sentence structure that would be heavily critiqued coming from a second grader. It's a wonder this book was such a bestseller: it has nothing to say; it's pure hype."
1,Make that minus 1 star...!,"Such drivel...what next, James? A book titled ""How to Cash in on the World's Needy and Desperate Who are Looking for Inner Peace?"" Or how about a compendium of psuedo-intellectual pop psychology coupled with eastern philosophy and some Scientology thrown in for good measure. Sounds like the makings of a mind-numbing, brain-dumbing cult if you ask me!Read Deepok Chpra, Dalai Lama or Herman Hesse if you want to be 'enlightened'. Pick up a Bible, Koran, Torah, the Bagdavadh Gita, some Taoist literature, and throw in some Freud, some Jung, (and let's not forget, some common sense!) and you will have a much better melting pot of spirituality and philosphy than Redfield can ever provide. And if you want some adventure, why not pop in a video--Raiders of the Lost Ark is a pretty obvious pick--kick back, relax and forget all about Redfield's doltish effort."
1,"Silly, juvenile, pseudo-religious junk for the weak-minded!","The title of this review says it all--the book is an utter waste of time. Are people so desperate for spiritual enlightenment that they will turn to this puerile, poorly-written trash for answers? Awful, even by New Age standards--and just a step below Marlo Morgan's atrocious books about Aborigines, and makes Richard Bach's saccharine efforts seem genuine. About as real and inspiring as powdered milk. For Christians, pagans, non-believers--all people--DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!"
1,Oh my gosh this book is awful,"I agree with an earlier reviewer - read Zen & the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. Redfield may have some interesting things to say, especially about the ""fight for energy and human evolution,"" but for the love of God, must he say them in such a mind-numblingly lame way? The dialogue was worse than the worst episode of Star Trek (no offense Trekkers), and the story was so laughable that I had to continuously force myself to keep an open mind & try to focus in on the point the author was trying to make. Man oh man, this book stinks.Why did the author have to disguise his message in such a ridiculous story? Does he trust his audience or not? Apparently not, which is insulting AND undercuts his own message."
3,Judge a book by its Critics and Supporters,"I'll keep it simple.Read at least 50 reviews of this book on Amazon, and you'll see something interesting. Almost every unhelpful and grammatically-poor review you'll read is written in praise of this book. I'm not saying that this book is bad because the people who love it are poor writers, but I do believe it reflects poorly on the book.As for me, I don't like New Age literature, but this one is okay. On the positive side: it's hopeful and interesting to read (despite the flat characters). It makes you feel good about yourself and the world.On the negative side: Although this book will pat you kindly on your back when life is stressful, it won't teach you how to turn your stressful life around.Try Steven Covey's 7 Habits of Successful People for something like that."
5,Enjoyable read -- fiction or not!,"I enjoyed this books very much. Whether it is the ""truth"" or fiction, I enjoyed it at it's own merit.I have this to say about the review by Allan Darrow: You clearly must imagine yourself to be an intellectual and unbelievably witty. I can see how you can give one negative review of a book but why then would you continue to read books by the same author? Just to give a few more ""witty"" and ""insightful"" reviews? Since you obviously believe that you're such an authority on religions and cultures--why not write a book and then we'll get to review it."
4,Fiction or Fact,"I must say I have read the book and that it was , a book I have read. Not a 5 star but a fictional 4 star that kept me intrigued for the course of a rainy day. It has been said that this book is either loved or loathed. Loved by those reading the book and loathed by those looking for answers."
3,Nice message!,"Not a great piece of literature but exciting and contains nice message. Didnt really give me new ideas but makes you wonder about many things in life...good spirited book! Recomend it, take it as it comes! Arni"
3,"Poor writing, but intriguing ideas","Sometimes I wanna scream in agony when I have to plod through yet another prosaic and undescriptive and boring scene transition. Very wordy. Very poorly edited. The boring storytelling is so incongruous with the beauty described in the text. He can cut down a lot of this crap and bring the scenes alive by using descriptive, functional words. I was pretty surprised what kind of writing can get published these days. Has he even been to Peru? Doesn&#65533;t sound like it. It feels like he just adopted Hollywood&#65533;s version of South America.But the ideas are very intriguing and that and my cousin&#65533;s strong recommendation are prodding me along. I&#65533;m at page 42. He&#65533;s got me hooked with the ideas about what could be awaiting humanity. That appeals to me. But for God&#65533;s sake, please, please get a darn editor to really work on this book for the future versions. The writing stinks and the publisher is just as culpable as the author."
4,Stimulating Ideas. Poorly Written,"I loved some of the ideas in the book. This book is useful for people that are really looking for the truth and are interested in self-discovery. It is not written very well though - which makes it harder... For those that are of a critical nature...this book would not be for them...Some of the principles and insights are really revealing and useful though...Another book that I just discovered that I love and made a gigantic difference in my life is: ""Working On Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book ABout Instantaneous Transformation"". It is the first book by two pioneers in Self-Realization and Personal Growth, Ariel and Shya Kane. Beautifully written and also has some very powerful principles for how to change your approach to living. Also not a book for sceptics who can find fault with everything..."
4,Uplifting insights in a simple story,"I enjoyed the bulk of this book and really felt as though I had benefitted from reading it. The last couple of insights seemed a little bizarre to the point of being cultish however on the whole the book has a very positive message.Other reviews have attacked the simplicity of the writing and the storyline however that is missing the point that the purpose of the story was simply to get the ""insights"" accross.Overall very good. Enjoyed it."
1,Big picture?,"Anyone with the IQ of a carrot could figure out what Redfield's ""big picture"" is. The problem is with the way he presents it. It comes across as too easy and, more importantly, hypocritical. And then he totally blows it when he forces his own make-believe ideals on us as if he's God, then asks us for money. If you think I would or should take tips on child-rearing from Redfield, you should have your head examined. And he apparantly has no genuine interest in conserving natural resources either, as his millions of books are made with the most glossy, tree-ravaging, non-recycled material there is. If he really cared, he would use a paperless way of conveying his message, such as publishing on the internet. Gee, I wonder why he hasn't? Could it be that people would then be able to access his books for free?"
4,Its a book for office workers who want to become spiritual,"I read this book at first, begrudingly, simply because everyone around me was raving on about it, and their attitudes towards life and other people had suddenly cahnged. So in the end I read it too, and at first I thought it was excellent. I still do agree that it is a very good book, but after reading it a few times, I get the impression that it is a book for suit wearers who want to become spiritual. There are far better non fiction storytelling books out there that have been around for a lot longer that will tell you all about the spiritual energies and enlightenment ways of life."
1,"Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb","The previous reviewer's opinion to the contrary I am not the sharpest pencil in the pack, nor am I a baby boomer but I've got to say that this was a really BAD book. This book is to pop spiritualism what ""Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus"" is to pop marriage-counseling books. I have seen more profound wisdom in Bazooka bubble gum comics. I have read other books like ""One"" and ""Illusions"" which successfully presented their spiritual point in the form of a novel without beating the reader over the head with it, so it CAN be done. This one just stinks."
1,There's no book like a really really bad book,"Based on the rather entertaining reviews of this book, I think I did rather well making it through the first 30 pages (and this without major stomach pains). I did, however, have a whopper of a headache afterward. I suppose that could be attributed to my lack of spiritual depth, as intimated by those favorable reviews of this not-fit-for-even-short-airplane-rides book. In retrospect, I suppose this book will nicely summarize our national (sad but true) state-of-consciousness as we cruise toward the new millenium. As antidote to this book, pick up any good book (even one you have read a few times). It helped me immensely, and worked much better than a headache tablet. Luckily, in Germany we can recycle paper products, and I found that a somewhat satisfying method of disposal."
1,VERY BAD,This has to be one of the most poorly written books I've read. The plot is weak and unbelievable. I tried in earnest to finish the book (mainly because of the people who had raved about it) but could not. I regret wasting my time.
2,Shallow amusement and some spiritual tickling,"I enjoyed this book. I enjoy most books i finish. I wont be recommending it to my friends though because i think it falls a long way short of brilliant.I think this book requires in the reader a certain leap of faith, an understanding or a belief in meditation, esp, extraspiritual etc. I believe in all these things, i meditate etc and try to keep an open mind. The story was rubbish but i found myself intrigued as to the final conclusions of the 'insights'.But is this book aimed at everyone?This is not start and finish spirituality. Anyone who judges it on this level is wrong to. And its not a book you would recommend for the plot. So whats it all about? My conclusion is that its a thinly disguised self help book, but lacks enough of the 'guidance' as to be of little use.Buy this book if you want some shallow amusement and some spiritual tickling but please dont embrace this book as the ultimate read."
3,somewhere inbetween,"Your negative reviews are stealing my energy,And your postive reviews are telling me I need my life to be changed.Guess I'll see what happens when I try to read the book.But I think I've somehow read it all ready."
2,I was suprised by this book,"Everyone I know who has read this book said it was a ""must read"" and that you learn so much from Redfield and his discovery of the nine insights. I bought the book and started to read it -- I was taken aback, I had NO idea it had all of the ""adventure"" of the author's racing through the Peruvian jungle to find the manuscript. That part of the book just did not cut it for me -- I thought the book was too long and the author could have just written up the insights and made the book a heck of a lot shorter.I'm not sure I agree with his findings, but it is an interesting concept. I cannot truly recommend this book, I found it somewhat dull and not very well written. As I said earlier, it could have been a lot shorter and made much more of an impact."
2,Don't waste your time,"I told my officemate at work about this book after I finished reading it and he found as much amusement in the ludicrous presentation of its concepts as I did. Not only is the writing sloppy but the ""adventure"" would be the first proposal thrown out of an X-Files script meeting. There is something profound latently lurking in the pages of this book but it never really comes into focus at any point in the story. Maybe someone else can do a better job discussing the same material in a different book."
1,you will be stupider for reading this book,"If i had to name the singularly worst piece of writing i have ever read, this would be it. an somehow, it managed many weeks on the bestsellers list! you will like this book if: a) inanimate objects or voices from no where instill you with the teaching of the great forest people. b) you've experimented with hallucinagenic drugs. the descriptions of the random colors will bring you right back to those LSD days when you thought you could fly. c) your reading abilities have not yet passed middle school level. the actual writing of this book was undoubtedly the worst i've ever seen. d) you have a chair thats appx. 3/4 an inch to short. using this book as a prop would be ideal.this book is horrible. don't even bother."
5,A True Awakening,The Celestine Prophecy is the best book I`ve ever read; especially if your going through your spiritual awareness You`d be able to appreciate it to the fullest.There was a time I was going through something in my life not understanding what it was.I picked up the Celestine Prophecy book and realized that I am going through these Insights I still am.For two year`s now.I am in my Spiritual Insight.
1,totally worthless - except as a lesson in ignorance,"The only insight anyone will get from this book is the insight of Redfield into his bank balance as thousands more idiots purchase this book in a misguided search for enlightenment. When I heard that there was a sequel, the Tenth Insight, I screamed with laughter. Now I see there are meditation courses and lectures to assist with helping you pour more money into his coffers. When will all these dreadful wishy washy new-age yuppie hippies realize that they gained nothing from this except a lesson in being ripped off. It is out there, it is real, it is more profound than you can imagine, but you will not find it in this book."
4,Not for those who wear sandals ....,"...this book is for the open minded. There are many who think they are open minded, and still have difficulty looking beyond their mundane and blinkered points of view.It is interesting to read the reviews of this book, and I agree that Redfield is no Gibran or Gurdjeff, but he has written a good book, highlighting what is essentially missing, from the world today.The message is simple and clear, and if you cannot appreciate the simplistic way in which this STORY is presented, then it is you that needs, more than anyone, to understand the underlying message.I would recommend this book to anyone starting out on their `Spritual Path', or to any fan of an adventurous yarn. Take this book too seriously and you will end up like the `one star reviewers'.Open your mind and your heart will follow."
5,the best book i've ever read!!!,i loved this book. it really gave me new direction and showed me how meaningful life is. i reccomend it to anyone with an open mind.
5,"read it, think about it..feel it...","Oh well...what can I say? You can like it or hate it. You can give 5 stars or no stars..it does not matter...what is important you have read THE BOOK...and if you are a human, please think about it..relax and think how it can change your life..how is it already affecting your life..you have read it..it stayed in you mind..and if you are are spritual person (your religion does not matter) look deep inside you...you already have some of the insights in you..just find them...love them...and enjoy happy life..."
1,A poorly written book,"This was one of the worst books I have read. I kept reading and reading, waiting to ""get it"", because everyone who has read it seems to ""get it"", but the whole thing continued to elude me. I found myself skimming pages just to find some substance. This is truly a poorly written book, and I cannot believe the reading public is so easily taken in."
2,Bah!,"What a mess. The beginning was interesting, but then it went way, way out. Save your bucks and borrow it from the library (or a friend who got duped into buying it)."
1,Untitled,"I would not recommend this book in conversation. However the person who lent it to me was quite interested in the book. I am finding that the book just wasn't the style of writing that I can be engaged in, but it may be for someone else."
1,Misleading Advertizing,"The ad for 'The Celestine Prophecy' states both: ""Like new condition with no marks, tears or missing pages (etc.)"" AND ""Audiobook"". Wanting a paper copy of the book I flipped a coin and ordered..and got an audio book. Fortunately it was damaged in transit and I returned the book. Altho' the audio arrived in 2 days (!), I have not received a replacement 'book' and I returned the audio to the owner more than two weeks ago. The Seller was great at shipping out their sale but have completely dropped the ball is regards to shipping me what I ordered or refunding my money."
1,Best for Hippies & followers of Environmentalism as a religion.,"The story is basically about seeing & understanding the ""aura"" that is supposedly around everyone ""best seen by looking at the person while consciously soft focusing your eyes"". Yikes!James Redfield has plenty of ""Can't we all just get along"" type of hippie dippy touchy-feely philosophy with lots of environmental whacko (say Rain Forest when you mean jungle, Wet Lands when you mean swamp) sophistry thrown-in."
5,Insightful Escape,"I enjoyed reading this insightful piece of fiction. It's great to read fiction, but still be able to reflect on it and to be able to see how it can apply to your real life. An inisightful escape."
1,i say it was real bad,"This book was so dumb oh my gosh. It starts off real dumb already cause it's subtitled ""an adventure"" like the way some little girl would subtitle her story for 4th grade class ""an adventure"". Then he just keeps meeting people and every character behaves and talks identically. By the end of the book there were like 2 dozen names swirling around and I couldn't remember who any of them were. That's how DUMB and BORING this book is. The rest of it is just him trying to shove his own personal blend of new age mubo jubo and psychology down your throat. It's no more valid than any of the other 200 hundred new age self help schemes that are out there. After I got done reading it I wanted to go run down the street and beat up a hippy. Wow, what a corny and badly written dumb book!"
3,Dissapointing,A lot of people recommended me this book but I was very dissapointed after I read it. Spiritualism meets Indiana Jones!!! This is one of the few cases where a movie may be better than the book.
4,Celestine Prophecy: A Learning Process,"I've just finished the book for the second time, and I'm fascinated by James Redfield's view of the future of our world. I plan to re-read 'The Tenth Insight', and have ordered 'The Secret of Shambala', both of which continue the Prophecy tale. His message is satisfying and exciting. His writing skills could use some help. Our nameless hero, written in the first person and not otherwise identified, is two-dimensional and incomplete. I kept reading for the message, which could have been as easily done without the fictional tale, and not for any depth of interest in the various and forgettable characters. As I recall, 'Tenth Insight' improved somewhat, and perhaps there is hope for 'Shambala'. Readers might enjoy, as I did, 'Analysis of the Spirit', by Carolyn Myss, Phd., a more serious, non-fiction look at the health and healing of the human spirit, but an adventure, none-the-less. Prophecy is yet very worth reading, despite its first-book flaws."
5,Awesome!,"This book had a lot of information in it that was very useful. For instance, it talked about the 4 different types of people. I thought that that was interesting. Second, I have read some of the other reviews and one talks about the character development and how it wasn't so great. I don't think that that was the point of the book. Redfield was trying to get the point across that the world was changing and the people are changing into a more spiritual world and the characters and the setting aren't the main part of the book so look for what the story is not every little detail in it."
2,Disappointed,"Why does everyone rave about this book? Maybe I expected too much, but with all the sequels and merchandise, I thought this would be an enlightening book.There were no insights for me. It's very simplistic and not well written. It doesn't really work as a novel, and there's no spiritual revelations. If you're looking for a good visionary novel, there are plenty out there. One I really liked was ""The Destiny of Miro"" which is intriging as well as enlightening. Or read any of Richard Bach's books."
3,It has its place,"I think the best way to describe this book and the rest of the series is as 'a taster of popular New Age theories'.What the author has done is gather together all the current popular new age philophies about the nature of 'God' and 'The way the Universe works', dumb them down to an easily understood form then put them into a pseudo-autobiographical storyline. Redfield is no writer, the style is atrocious, but by adding a 'conspiracy theory' into the storyline and loudly proclaiming that people should not read it as a true story he has guaranteed that people will do just that :) thus managing to sell a lot of copies of a very badly written piece of fiction. I just wish I had thought of it first :)It is not a total waste of space, it does give the reader many interesting points to think about, but please don't take it as evidence of a real life conspiracy to hide 'The Truth' :)"
5,A powerful book for those who are searching,"Many may disagree with me but I think this book is good for those who are damaged by religion. If we as humans don't believe in a god, somehow we create one to believe that there is something more out there. This book encourages spiritual awarness within all of us. I truely believe this book is fictional and this did not happen in factual accounts as the book is trying to imply. I believe James Redfield is trying to convey a message and the message is a powerful one. I feel he had to get his message across through an action filled fictional adventure. Like most of the stories of the bible is filled with action, lust and adventure. I'm not trying to compare this book to the bible but I think he got his idea based on the bible's formula of interest. This book is great for those who are searching for knowledge of the spirit and a spiritual awareness within.I believe life is a journey not a destination especially a journey of ones' spirit."
2,Not a spiritual classic.,"When I read this book, I felt that the author has a very narrow view of the human spirituality as well as the latest developments in science. I did not found any new ideas in this book, as some would say. I would recommend this book only as the very basic introduction to some possibilities, of the human spiritual development."
2,Oh brother,All I can say is that it was recommended by a dear friend. It was entertaining at times. IT was a quick read. It was not particularly anything else.
5,The Celestine Prophecy,"A very interesting but somewhat deep book. It was recommended by a friend and I trust her choices in reading materials. Although I found it confusing at the beginning, I am starting to get the gist of its message. It has presented a challenge and I may even re-read it. Thanks, Judith."
1,Boring...,This was a tedious read. Very boring and not much in way of character development. I don't understand all the hype about this book.
1,Get that star out of this review,"I may never read again. The FDA should get involved in this thing. Some kind of Surgeon General's warning on the cover, like: Warning! This volume may reduce your vocabulary to four despicable adjectives and will most likely prevent you from hearing the term 'insight' ever again without feeling ill. The horror..."
1,Glad I'm not the only one!,"I tried reading this book years ago while in grad school and never finished. I couldn't remember why so I decided to read it again. Now I remember!! This book is awful. The writing (and I use that term loosely) is horrible and very elementary. Is there a point? After awhile, I stopped caring because the writing was so bad and the descriptions and dialogue were worse. The flow was very choppy and unbelievable. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and am amazed there are other books in this 'series'. Different strokes for different folks I guess!"
2,Not for me,"This book was not for me. If it's for you, that's fine, but I felt like it was a Dan Brown novel crossed with that What the Bleep movie, only written by a high school kid and totally boring."
1,boring and repetitive,the whole book is trying to convince you that the world is made of coincidences and synchronicities. that is true when you are tuned and filter external stimuli seeing only the ones you are tuned with.
3,Celestine Prophecy,"I really liked some of the ideas and concepts in this book such as the Nine Insights about how people treat each other and the ""energy"" involved when communicating with others. But MOST IMPORTANTLY - simply being kind and caring towards others which in my opinion could have been given more emphasis than some of the other concepts. The storyline was fun though and interesting and definitely made me think but truth be told, it does have it's flaws.If you're looking for a book about the spiritual ideas of Love/caring and being kind towards others and/or just want to know more about the meaning of life, I highly recommend readingThe Lost Teachings of Atlantisby Jon Peniel."
4,It's good - but only the first time.,I read it as a young teenager and was moderately moved. Kind of fun to play with the lessons inside. Years later had an argument with a woman who was sure it was a true story of an ancient manuscript actually found in Peru; I tried reading it again recently and was disappointed.
4,The Best Napoleonic Game Yet.,"Relive the glory days of the little corporal's era in this fun,exciting,& challenging game that recreates the complexities of Napoleonic era warfare in real-time format.Pay no heed to critics who dismiss this game for more simple & less cerebral teen follies;the game has been improved by subsequent patches & will be further bettered with upcoming ones.Strategy wargaming doesn't get better than this.My rating is 4.5 stars."
3,Good potential. Try again.,"I was really excited about this game. Unfortunately it does not live up to expectations. The graphics are not up to standards achieved on some other strategy simulations (the Cossacks preview, for example). Movement, at least on my PC,(which is able to handle B17 2 with no problems)is not smooth. Also, the game menu, graphics and music are not of the quality, for instance of Sudden Strike or Age of Empires. its been a few years since the fine Gettysburg game. One would have expected improvements in this genre reflecting advances made since then. If you are into 16th to 19th century European strategy, I suggest Age of Sail 2 or wait for Cossacks."
1,...?where's the graphics!?,"Frankly, I don't know you, so what do I care if you waste yourmoney on this B-class game. I'm just writing this because I wasmislead (and therefore am upset) by the PRICE of this ... game. It is often the case that you get what you pay for. So if you buy a game for $15.00, you shouldn't expect a masterpiece, however, this game advertises with a ... price tag and somewhat good reviews which is usually enough to expect good game-play and well defined graphics. Well, think again. The price tag on this game should read ... (at the most). I mean think about it, how on earth can this game sell for ... when for ten $$ more you can get a spectacular game like ""Age of Empires?"" But, if you really insist on wasting your money, like I said, what do I care?"
1,Waterloo:Graphics worst battle,I was very disappointed about this game. The graphic were the worst I have ever seen. I have all of the Sid Meiers games and love them all. That is why I don't understand how these graphics ended up so bad. Having to try that hard to make out what a unit is on screen is just terrible!
1,WHO SIGNED THESE B2K WANNABE'S,"okay b2k, marques houston, now these fools going around making cheesy booty shaking songs I would'nt be caught dead listening to these clowns."
3,Disjointed writing style and a tad arrogant,"I read this book and while it is inspiring and amazing, I found Bill's VERY disjointed writing style very distracting- one chapter has flying history, how cancer destroys cells, college buddy reunion, and how his public speaking is going, along with 5 other topics. I also found that his frequent need to ""name drop"" redundant and unnecessary to the plot of the book. There is not alot in this book about Rocky and their daily life together, which I found disappointing."
4,A good book as a collateral reding,"The book is well written and presents a novel perspective to old electrodynamic problems. However, certain misprints and erroneous references diminish somehow the value of this otherwise exellent book."
2,Not much color,"Try as you might, not much color comes off. A good deal of glitter will be applied, and then it'll fall all over your face, but the color doesn't seem to want to apply. The bit of color that does come off is a very nice green. A little lighter than crayon green.This particular color (not all of the MAC shadows, just some) has a rough texture, not silky, not smooth.I would never purchase this color again."
3,:|,"This is the third book out of the five in the Follow that Baby series. I have not been overly impressed with any of the books in the series this far. The series is about a missing pregnant woman, Sabrina Jensen. Sabrina believes, as does everyone else that the baby's father is dead. Jack Wentworth is dead and his family wants to welcome Sabrina and her baby into the family, but she has disappeared. In the Sheriff and the Imposter Bride, the Sheriff believes that he has found Sabrina, only its not her, but her twin sister Rachel that he finds. Riley Hunter, the sheriff, has no idea that the woman is not Sabrina. Rachel takes Riley on a long roller coaster full of lies.I found it hard to be interested in any of the characters and the way the plot ties into the series is boring and uninteresting. I plan on finishing the series. I just hope that the remaining books are better."
4,Sexy lawman falling for the wrong woman...?,"~ Secret Identity Heroine ~Rachel Jensen's identical twin is in trouble-and she's missing. So when strapping Oklahoma sheriff Riley Hunter mistakes her for the missing mom-to-be, Rachel plays along...until she becomes torn between continuing the charade to protect her family or confiding in the honorable lawman who's captured her heart."
4,Another pretty solid album from SCC,"Another year and another SCC album their 7th complete group album (of their 8 total, not to mention the 3 by Havoc & Prodeje). It's probably the 2nd or 3rd best album I own (I have 6 of them). As usual it's the beats that are better then their lyrics, and mainly because, as usual, Prodeje does most of the production (9 of the 18 songs). Tony Lee does 4, DJ Ace, D Black each do 2 and C-Note does 1. Of the 18 songs, 2 are almost classics, 8 are good, 3 I skip, and 5 are ok. Guests rap on 3 songs and LV does the hook on 4. A nice album for their fans or fans of funky west coast rap.#1 - 8.5 (short but tight)#2 - 7.5#3 - 6#4 - 9.5 (great upbeat song -- f/ LV)#5 - 6#6 - 8.5 (f/ LV)#7 - 8 (nice beat)#8 - 8.5 (f/ Floc Gang)#9 - 8.5#10 - 7.5#11 - 7#12 - 9.5 (f/ Mellow & LV -- nice beat)#13 - 5.5 (F/ LV)#14 - 6.5 (f/ Angelic)#15 - 8 (f/ Floc Gang & LV)#16 - 7.5 (f/ Angelic)#17 - 8.5#18 - 9 (f/ Boki)Check all my reviews"
5,VOODOO CHANTEES YUM,"This is an album that TG would call a bootleg. It must have been recorded off the soundboard then, because it sounds great.However, this album has a lot more grungy guitar work than I would have thought. It also has Zyklon B Zombie buried in it somewhere, which is a jukebox essential for TG. And of course songs which appear elsewhere under another name. But it is at least 80% new material.I recommend this album, because you must have as much Gristle as possible. And this one works well, play it on your porch as kids trick or treat. You will retain almost all of your candy that way."
2,Not Scratch Resistant,I've owned it for a few months. The crystal scratches easily. Mine has a dozen or more serious scratches which makes the face hard to read. Not a good buy.
3,"Good watch, lousy band","I really enjoyed this watch for about 18 months. It was at that point I began to notice cracks in the band. I was able to glue a couple of them until i just gave up. The band was disintegrating on my arm. I did wear it every day, but it saw little or no abuse as I sit behind a desk. Also the crystal is prone to scratching.EDIT: I just called Timex. They will repair/replace for $10. They also suggested that WalMart may have prepaid Timex shipping envelopes in the Watch department. Swing by to pick one up and shipping there and back is on them. With this I would bump to 4 stars if I could have and if the crystal was better I'd give it 5."
1,poor band quality limits life of watch,"The watch itself is great but after only a year the band starting tearing in muliple places until it completely broke apart...and not from extreme use - I work in an office setting and am by no means an ""ironman"". The band is permanently connected to the watch so there is no option of replacing the band. Very disappointing. I've tried superglueing it but I have to re-glue every month or so. If you are going to go with an Ironman watch go with one that has either a replaceable band or one of different design."
4,Good Watch,I use this watch everyday at work and working out. Looks great. Very comfortable and no problems so far. Would definitely recommend this watch if you're looking for a watch to wear while exercising and while going out on a friday night.
2,Digital clock setting doesn't work and not for diving,"Following the instructions, three of us could not get the digital time to ever set. Then the website was a bit misleading in that it says it's good for a DEPTH of 100 meters. We searched Amazon for a ""dive watch"" and this watch came up. Once we got it, the instructions state not for diving. What good is 100 meters DEPTH if you're not DIVING to that DEPTH? NOT A DIVE WATCH. Am returning product."
2,Reset button,"I had this watch only for few daysPros: Looks sturdyBig display and easy to see.Cons: The red rest button is hard to press, therefore can be a challenge during runs. As I bought this one for its stopwatch function and its hard to press the reset button for the stopwatch, therefore only 3 stars.The clock hands don't illuminate at night, as compared to few other Timex models."
1,poor watch band reviews,Looks great. Was scared away by accounts of the band only lasting a year or so. Would have been my first choice.
4,Good for the money,"Fair quality, design and look for the money.What is not so good is that the back light lasts only 2 sec."
3,its good watch,"its very nice watch and beautifull,and timex #T5E51 working good, i like this watch, its the best for every one."
1,Don't buy if you rely on analog.,I am training for my third marathon and recently purchased an Ironman Dual-Tech watch. I specifically wanted a watch with both analog and digital clocks. The analog watch does not keep time at all. It would fall behind the digital clock pretty quickly until it would stop all together. I have recently seen several reviews where this is common with this watch. I wish I had seen them before-hand. I can't believe Timex can't make a dual watch that performs properly. I have not looked at the other features because the watch is a complete waste for me without the analog.
2,Band needs alot of help!,Owned for less than two years and band now cracking. It has been a great watch with the indigo function as my favorite aspect of the watch!
3,"Broke after 2 weeks, but decent watch","Nice looking and decent watch. However, mine broke after two weeks of using it. One day at the pool, the digital function just froze on the chronograph function. Also the dark background is sometimes hard to read - especially in the pool while doing laps.I can see the plastic band breaking in a bout a year, but it is much more sanitary than the cloth strapped ones."
4,I was very pleased,"... I decided to buy it mostly because of the cheap price. But after opening and playing it, I was really glad I bought it. Notice I only gave it 4 stars, but to me that is very good (5 stars are reserved for recordings of the utmost quality).Some of these concertos might be familiar to the listener, as they were to me, if he has heard Bach's keyboard concertos. However, I have always felt that the oboe was the most beautiful of wind instruments, and I enjoyed hearing them in this new light.While I am not an expert on the oboe, the playing seems very good, and the phrasing and touch of the strings could not be better. Here's one recording with which can't go wrong, whether you are new to classical music or a seasoned listener."
5,J.S. Bach Oboe Concertos,"J.S. Bach is my favourite. Of his music I probably love his concertoes most. The 5 concertoes on this CD are all reconstructions, according to the notes in the cover, i.e.the available scores by Bach himself are for other instruments:mainly harpsichord. The assumption is that Bach had also made versions for other solo instruments at an earlier date.I actually know each of the recorded pieces here played on either harpsichord, organ, violin or oboe. One of the concertoes, BWV 1053, as mentioned in the cover too, is shared with a cantata.I have it as BWV 169.The all oboe versions here, I think, are definitely the most charming."
4,xmas plush review,i bought this for xmas to give as a gift for a young fan of nightmare before xmas and she really liked it alot.
4,chux,"These pads are absorbent . The cost was a deciding factor, but I am pleased with the quality also. Would purchase again."
1,Review of pads,"The service was good, but the pads were terrible. They had a thin covering over plastic with no padding for absorption. Pretty useless for 7 puppies peeing all day long (:0)."
1,"Item should read, ""Nonabsorbable underpad""!","Used as pee pad for small dog. Did not hold any moisture, it just ran right through to the floor. Stacked the pads four deep with same outcome. Worthless. Wish I could rate it at zero stars."
4,good price,The price is good and they are great for lining the guinea pig cage as they do not have to absorb a lot of fluid.
3,Mediocre Quality,These underpads bunch and tear easily. I would not recommend them for use on a regular basis. The Green Champion Underpads are a much better buy.
2,too thin,The product is waterproof. Thats it! it is not soft very thin and very rough texture.If you are using it under a sheet it will work well but for direct contact I wouldnt use it again.
1,PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY....,"I BOUGHT THEM TO BE USE AS WEE-WEE PADS FOR MY SMALL DOGS ,BUT SADLY I SAY THEY DONT WORK.THEY ARE THIN... PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. THANKS"
2,poor quality,"these were very thin compared to others doesnt hold urine well, balled up underneath, and plastic backing way too thin for adult use"
3,anyone need to go potty?,"JUST GOT A GREAT BICHON,AND HES SOO SMALL,THAT HE NEEDS NOT TO OUTSIDE TO WALK HIM,SO WE DECUDED TO HAVE HIM GO INSIDE.HES PERFECT,WE AT FIRST USED NEWSPAPERS...CHEAP!! SO NOW WE DECIDED ON WEE-WEE PADS,THEY'RE DECENT,BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE MORE UNDERPADS THAT ARE BETTER EQUIPPED FOR THIS JOB,A LITTLE LIGHT IN THE PADDING AREA,BUT THE PRICE WAS $10.33 PER EACH 100! IN A BAG !. SO I RECEIVES 300,GREAT PRICE,NEEDS MORE PADDING,SO I NEED TO BUYMORE QUALITY PRODUCTS."
3,Used for baby changing table,Works ok. absorbs pee when the little one squirts everywhere. Plastic rips pretty easy. Cant take more than 2 or 3 pee episodes. wish plastic liner was a little more durable.
1,Not very absobent,"Not very absorbent/thick and they stick to the patients skin after laying on them for a few hrs. came in a case of 150, they should sell them in smaller quantities. too much trouble to return such a large package. will probably use for others things around the house."
1,Inconsistent quality and very thin,"I've ordered these pads 3 times from this vendor - and each time the pads were packaged a little differently. One time they were divided into shrink wrapped packs of 100, the next time in packs of 25, and this last time, they were simply packed loose in the box.Matching the variance in packaging was the quality of the pads themselves. The first shipment had higher quality with some thickness to the absorbent pad (though still not as much as you would get purchasing training pads from a pet store.) This last shipment delivered pads that are so thin that they often do not absorb all the wetness leading to an overflow and ensuing cleanup.Until there's some quality control, I would not purchase this item again."
1,IT'S A MOST AWFUL PRODUCT that I have used! Unbelieveable Defected weewee pads!,"The Wee Wee Pads are SO DEFECTED! Each sheet either ripped, or has holes, or the absorbent layer only cover 60% of the 17x24!!I am certainly not very happy about the product! It's a very low quality WeeWee Pads that I have used in 12 years!They do not come in many small wrapped packages as shown on line. They shipped a big clump, and do not pack nicely, more than 60% are squeezed and wrinkled!It's a very irresponsible manufacture."
2,Won't buy these again,"Compared to other disposable pads I have purchased from drug stores and discount stores, these are very cheaply made (made in China). There is so little padding that when you hold it up to the light, you can see through it and if you cut it the ""padding"" filters out like dust. When wet, the moisture spreads out over a large area, so you have to dispose of the whole thing. I contacted the seller and they were very nice and offered to take them back at no cost to me, but felt like the first one or two were just defective and wanted me to try a couple of more. The rest are just like the first ones, so I purchased some from Sam's Club and am very happy with them. I decided to keep these and use them for other types of spills."
2,Thin and smelly,These chux are made in China - they smell like machine oil and are very thin - they don't hold much fluid at all.
2,Don't waste your money.,"STOP,Do not buy these pads for any living person or animal.I have just one bunny rabbit and I have to change these a fewtimes daily.The liquid just sits there. I am glad I don't use these for a large dog. Oh, My!These pads claim to be soft and fluffy. Don't believe it, forit isn't true. These are the thinnest pads I have ever used.Because they are so thin I use 2 or 3 times the amount thatI used with the thicker pads. I won't buy these thin pads again,I will pay the $10.00 extra and buy the thicker pads.signed,Bunny Lady."
1,Last Box is a Loser,"I've ordered these pads numerous times, from various vendors, but this last batch is a waste of my time, and by extension, my money. They look all perfect and neat in the box - very promising - but there's a dirty little secret as to why they look so nice. When you try to use them they won't unfold without a lot of extra, unnecessary work. You have to pick and peel them apart - arduously - section by section, instead of a simple, quick, two-handed snap to open. Same money, infinitely worse product. Won't buy from Direct Care Store again. It was a first purchase from them, and a last. The fiber content is different this time. The fibers stick to each other and stay stuck. Never had this issue before and don't want it again. What a pain to open and use. Sheesh."
2,Perfect Wee Pads,This is a great item for small indoor dogs who are wee pad trained. It is best to have a tray under the pad and not just place the pads on the floor because they tend to soak through. Remember you get what you pay for.
2,Stinks!,I'm in the second package of 3 in the case and I'm getting the chemical smell as mentioned by another reviewer. They are also thinner than the last time I ordered from this vendor.
3,Inconsistent quality,"With an elderly dog we go through alot of pp pads. This is the best price I have found. The shipping is always super-fast, but the quality of the pads varies dramatically. I have yet to receive the same brand twice and have ordered three times. Last time they were very flimsy and produced many leaks.I wish this seller would just stick with the better and more consistent quality products. I haven't yet opened the latest shipment but they came from China in a totally different box. If these are poor quality as well I will not reorder these from Amazon again."
2,Good price BUT...,Padded surface is less than other pads (2 inches all around)...Not too absorbent due to thinner lining...Prefer Dynarex 1341 product for my little poodle
1,not suitable for paper-training puppies,"this product is extremely thin and does not contain enough absorbent material to be used as a puppy pad. Two of the four edges are sealed which causes urine run off from the other two sides, again attributable to poor absorbancy. Be sure to read the fine print in product specifications to help make the right choice."
3,They work,After receiving them I see why they were so much cheeper then the others. The pad is very thin and not nearly as absorbant. They are working for me though.
4,"works fine, is waterproof, not very absorbent","The plastic liner works fine and doesn't let water through, but the material inside the liner is bunchy and sparse. Not as much like a paper towel as a few cotton balls on a plastic sheet. For the price, though, it's hard to complain and it works for our needs."
3,Decent product for the price.,"This unit absorbs a fair amount of liquid, but I would like a higher absorbency product. Unfortunately the cost is a bit prohibitive and these are a decent alternative."
2,Thin,Way to thin. no absorbency. Would never buy again. Been trying to give them away.Buy the thicker ones next time.
3,A little thin,"They do the job, put I would recommend doubling them for added protection, which kills the saving over my regular brand"
1,use for wee wee pads......,these are horrible......if these are used for bed protectors the poor caregiver must have an awful lot of laundry to do!. My yorkie goes once and it gets saturated and wicks right to the edge and under the pad so the floor gets wet and the plastic holds the moisture against the floor. Will go back to my more expensive pads. They have hemmed edges and thicker plastic and hold the urine. You get what you pay for!!
3,disposable blue underpad chux,Irregulars. Used for my puppy and the best price I could find.These do the trick. I recommend them to puppy owners everywhere.
2,poor material,The price is cheap but I guess you get what you paid for.. very disappointed with the outcome. Not recommended.
1,Cheap and thin,So thin you can only use it once then you need to throw it out. No wonder its cheap. This is my first and last.
1,I wish I would of read the REVIEWS first.,"I wish I would have read the reviews on this item before I purchased them, I would not of placed the order. This item should not be allowed to be listed as chux except for maybe, maybe used on a changing table and it should specify ""Not for Adults"". The material is thin, water puddles and the backing doesn't allow it to slide which makes it impossible to position under your body without assistance. I would not recommend this for human usage, maybe for pets but I don't own one to let you know for sure."
2,Dont ship expedited,"Product was fine, but I paid a lot of expedited shipping and they could not get the product mailed for three or four days"
2,Too Thin,"Great seller, quick shipping, but i'm not happy with the quality of the product. They're too thin. The last box of Chux I got had more substance so it held more. This has a super thin amount of the white stuff, and i end up with a puddle sitting on the blue plastic."
4,Same Stuff They Gave Me From The Hospital,"I got several sheets of those thin, blue underpads from the hospital when my baby and I were discharged. They work great for lining the changing table and don't take up much room in your diaper bag. Disposable...a plus. However, they ARE thin and not very absorbent. I wouldn't use them to pee or poo on like training pets. But for what I use them for, lining the changing table in case there's a smidge here or there so I can just toss the dirtied pad and not have to wash the fabric cover (or whatever material you use on your changing table that requires washing), these work great. They won't soak through if you don't drench the pad. I do have to work quick on the few occasions when my baby pee the pad because it spreads. For the price and what I need them for, these are good. As a semi-waterproof liner, these work. For the purpose of underpads...not so much."
1,Be aware that all pads are not alike,Much too thin for an adult male. Prefer the green underpass for thickness and size.Would use these only on top of the green pad as an extender.
1,underpads - poor quality,"too thin, tears when you pull it and liquid of any sort leaks through. have no clue what someone would use these for - i had to double it to use it. am returning what i have not used."
1,Paper thin,"This is basically a layer of toilet paper over a pice of thin plastic. Urine collects in a pool on top. There is little or no absorption HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. I ordered Dynarex and Kendall 300 pack on the same day. When they arrived, the Kendall package was 4 times the size of the Dynarex making the thickness of the pads even more obvious."
1,Disappointed with these chux,This product is cheap made and will not keep liquid from going through it. Waste of money. Will not order this again. Very disappointed.
1,Buyer beware,I ordered Dynarex underpads as I love that brand. The shipment arrived super fast but they substituted a VERY thin underpad that in no way compares to Dynarex. I contacted the seller and heard no response. Buy from a seller that ships what you purchase!
4,No complaints,Everything arrived in a timely manner and was as specified. I have no complaints with the entire transaction.
3,"Good deal, low quality","While these pads are a fantastic price, the quality is lacking. I have them for my two chihuahuas & if I don't want a leak through I have to double them up."
3,Inconsistent,"My only complaint about the Disposable Blue Underpad Chux is that they are not consistently made. I order 600 at a time, and one box may contain pads that have an ample and evenly distributed filling, then the next package may be just the opposite: very little filling, spotty coverage, in many places no filling, and filling may be clumped in places on the pad. Just when I think I've found a vendor I can stick with because of a good quality product, my next order may be a disappointment. And when I use 8-15 pads a day, it gets expensive when they aren't as absorbent as they should be. On the positive side, my orders are prompt, and well boxed and packaged, and when used, they mask the odor very well."
5,A Must Have Book,"This book is such a great gem; I ran across it by accident on Amazon and bought it used. I'm so glad I did. I love William Elliott's life story but the people who chose to interview are great too. I've never heard of some of them yet every one of them has such an interesting take on life. This is a ""big picture"" kind of book. It's the kind of book where you can read a chapter, think about it for awhile, then come back to it when you have a chance. I'm so glad he followed his passion and dream; and that these famous people gave this ""no name"" their time. I think it says something about each one of them as well. A must have book for the spiritual seeker."
4,Rev. Gary Fairchild,"I used this book for a study session with 10 other people (common everyday Christians). Most felt that the language was a little bit above their understanding, and many had to really ""work"" at trying to understand what was being said. Over all I thought that the book gave a very good overview of perspectives that most Christians don't want to engage. Elliott was interesting, and I think that the average person would get lost in most of the interviews because of the language barriers if they weren't familiar with many terms and different religions and or spiritual sources used in this book. It was a little long and I am not sure if anything was resolved, but, we never though we would find the answer in this book. I just hope Mr. Elliott grew from and through it."
4,Graham Webb - Ice cap shampoo and conditioner,Graham Webb - Ice cap shampoo and conditioner I have been using this product for years for my hair and it does a great job with my thick hair. The only problem I've encountered is with it handling chlorine damage. I've had to use a supplemental product to correct that damage.
5,The Cheated Songs Review,"I am form the island of St. Lucia in Caribbean. We love country music but this song is making history in the dance houses/ clubs.Hell Yes, I Cheated. Love it."
2,Plastic!!,"Ok, so i bought these for some reason thinking they were metal. Obviously they're not... Not an entirely bad thing as i've seen plastic sights work just fine. But these didn't even fit well in the front post of my AK, and if that were the end of the problems i'd be ok b/c they are still useful. But things get worse folks. If you shoot any reasonable amount of ammo out of an AK(150 to 200 rounds)than your gun could get hot enough to melt the post in your gun like it did mine. So overall would not recommend this product to anyone as cheap as they are, just not worth the time it takes to remove a melted sight."
2,Cheap and not very useful.,"The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because you get five of them. This is not a good alternative to a real high visibility sight (tritium or even fiber optic). They are cheap plastic and they will melt if you fire your rifle for an extended period of time (which most people with AK's do). Further, they simply do not show up in bad lighting conditions much better than the standard black sights. Save your money and get a real hi-viz or other metal sight with tritium/fiber optic."
3,I like it,Was shipped on time and was t disappointed with the product.. They are made of plastic. But still seems tough.
1,these are junk,"Like the title says, these are just junk. I cant even get them to thread in my rifle. They just dont work"
1,How hard is it???,"Ordered the ak/sks front sights and received the ar15 front sights. Some dummy in the warehouse must have labeled them all wrong because the sticker on the package says they're for the ak/sks.I know I'm not the first person that had to deal with this issue so I beg the question: how hard is it to do a little quality control?Treat your employees a little better amazon, and maybe they'd work a little harder for you."
5,perfect,"Great, cheap option if you need to replace your front sight pin like I did. They fit perfectly into the base using the front sight tool. Highly recommended."
1,Doesn't do Daryl and John justice.,"The mastering quality is without a doubt the worst I have ever encountered on a $10.00+ CD. It gets worse however; in a most egregious production error, Oates is spelled ""Oats"" on the cover. That in itself epitomizes the quality of this release. Hopefully someday these songs will be re-released in greater fidelity. Until then I'd recommend ""The Atlantic Collection"" or ""Hall and Oates"" if you're looking for some of the duo's older and more obscure work."
1,Tosca done badly.,"Guleghina usually makes anything look good, but this time she had to suffer the worst sets and the worst stage direction I've ever seen in my life. The annoying skewed sets brought to mind a bad hangover, bent glasses, or my worst migraine. I found myself unable to ignore the tenor's exclusive attention to the promptor's box, and in spite of the nice voice and a passionatesituation,""Cavaradossi"" never connected with ""Tosca"". (I longed for Tosca to sing ""hey, I'm over here"" while the prompter's box was being adored; learning one's role is a minimal requirement for praiseworthy performance, and even Pavorati was bad about that.) Finally, the last scene-a ridiculously long flight of stairs for Tosca to climb, with skirt hitched up and audience wondering if she would make it, to end the worst version of Tosca I've ever seen. Bummer."
3,"Pretty Common Sense Stuff, but...","It contains mostly common sense - but as we all know, common sense isn't common. The most important take aways from the book were th know what your value really is, know how to effectively measure it, now how to effectively translate the value into customer value, and know how to reliably control the delivery of the value to the market. A good reminder."
5,Classic Primer on Value Selling,"Here it is, March 2009 and I'm just now getting around to reviewing this book. My apologies to Mack and Peter! Even though the book is quite old (by today's standards) its lessons are timeless. Especially relevant in today's corporate world are the sections on:- how to talk value to different levels in an organization- understanding how ""good enough"" can be a devastating opponent- how to reposition your competitor as low valueSome of the examples are a bit dated, but the principles are still highly relevant. This is a great book for both beginner and expert salespeople. It is also relevant for selling ""internal"" ideas!"
1,Poorly written and somewhat pointless,"If I had one word to describe this book, it would be ""amateurish."" It's painfullly obvious a professional editor never went anywhere near this thin manuscript. Among many grammatical sins, the author uses exclaimation marks for nearly everything! Sometimes she uses two!! Not to be unkind, but the author should have considered a writing course along with culinary school. (Before cooking school, she was an aerobics instructor.)If you're interested in this sort of book, read Michael Ruhlman's ""The Making of a Chef,"" which is far superior. Unlike this one, it's a well written and insightful account of what it's like to go to culinary school. That book is based on his experiences at the Culinary Institute of America. Update to review: I also recommend ""The Sharper Your Knife, the Less You Cry"" by Kathleen Flinn. It's about her experiences at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris, and a truly wonderful read."
1,And I asked for this for Christmas . . . . .,"This book is insufferably bad. It lacks greatly for an editor. The author will switch tense 3 times in a single paragraph. The punctuation is horrible, and the content is lacking a clear organization. The depth of information does not go beyond simple statements: ""We learned this, then we learn that, and we will learn to do those."" She also needs to learn the virtue of pronouns as a way to avoid using the same word (in this case ""toque"") in 6 consecutive sentences.Do not buy this book. It will not satisfy anyone's quest for knowledge or interest in culinary school and will be impossible to read through the grammatical errors and dullness of discussion of an otherwisely interesting topic."
2,Unsufferable,"I still can't understand how the author managed to write a book on an experience where she seemed to be naive through to the end. The book seems to parallel the author's culinary experience and interest, it only skims the top. She never fully developed any idea or breakthrough experience, and admittedly didn't feel she excelled, yet still felt ok with being called ""chef"" at the book's end. It is incredible the lack of enthusiasm that was displayed for the very art that she believed herself to be called to. I personally feel that a person that truly cares about what he/she does would be interested in all aspects, including history and culture. Yet these are the very things that in the book she claims she will not ""bore"" you with. Basically, I found that the book told me nothing new. I already know the basic curriculum just from looking at the website, I wanted a thorough first hand experience. Instead I got a ""yadda yadda yadda"" approach."
1,died immediatly,"arrived in poor condition. i bough lilacs from this company and they were fine and still thriving. the rose however didn't make it.this happens with plants and that is not my problem. the company expects ME to pay for return postage for a dead bush, OUTRAGEOUS!This is HORRIBLE customer service!!!! Don't buy here!!"
1,Not worth your money,"This rose arrived in a fair condition. I thought it was the shipping. I planted the rose immediately as I did with other roses (including the same variety) from different nurseries hoping it would revive. It never happened. As a matter of fact, it is declining. I am expecting it to die entirely any day now. Regardless of how hard I tried to nourished it back to health. It is not like I cannot take care of roses. I have multitude of roses. I always order online from nurseries that give one year guarantee. Since this one does not ship replacements or give you the money back if their plants do not perform, I simply threw my money away. Go somewhere else to buy your roses (sometimes cheaper). They guarantee success or they replace the good.They promised the rose will bloom this year. Unfortunately, it fights for its survival. BIG NO NO."
5,Bzzzzzzzzzzap,"There you are with the latest Conte on the player, relaxing in the recliner, with the headphones on, grooving to Paolo's raspy voice in your ears, and then.....the kazoo cuts in. Instant grin material. Was first introduced to PC on an all jazz FM station when they played Lemon Gelato. Next step was to the library and I was hooked. He is a TALENT! And for those into good performers try Mariza, an upcoming Portugese Fado singer. Another great voice/performer. Happy listening."
3,Not what I expected,"This was an intact CD in good shape in a brown sleeve. No info on the songs, or any of what one gets usually. I don't know if it was promoted that way or not. I was disappointed."
3,Love one song,"Bought this album for only one song, but I enjoy the others as pleasant background music."
5,Rock-N-Roll Frankenstien DVD,"I love this cheesy/disturbing B Movie!!! One of the best ""Low Budget"" horror/comedys ever made...REALLY!! I've been looking for this film for years, and finally found it. If you have a fear of gore and ""unnatural urges"" this movie is not for you. Though Elvis would laugh his a$$ off at this one...LOL. ""Thank you...thank you very much"""
1,not worth your money unless you're a big fan of hilary duff,"This CD really didn't impress me... most of the songs require no talent to perform, and they aren't pleasant to my ears. The only reason people should buy it is if they really, really, really love Hilary Duff. I do not recommend buying it. If you want to waste your money, go ahead, but I warned you. The Disney film Holes has a MUCH better soundtrack. I honestly think that it is one of the best soundtracks put out in years from Disney. If you want a Disney movie soundtrack to listen to, buy that one."
3,Sal's R/V,The cd when played would stop then continue again. It would be nice if it just plays on without problem.
5,Really cool,why not: 4/5 really cool just get's a little old after a whilethe tide is high: 5/5 one of the best songs on the cdall around the world: 0/5 ick... i hate this song so much the worst song on the cdwhat dreams are made of balled: 4/5 niceshining star: 5/5 really awesome i am a jump5 fan so it's really cool to mevolare: 3/5 this song is ok it's not the best.open your eyes: 2/5 i don't like it at allyou make me feel like a star: 5/5 i really like this song alot it has a good messagesupermodel: 3/5 i find this song funnywhat dreams are made of: 5/5 the other best song on the cdon an evening in roma: 3/5 it's okgirl in the band: Good singer just don't like the song i've never really liked hard rock 2/5suite: 5/5 really nice good peaceful songwhy not mix: it's ok the beat is cool not quite as good as the original but still the beat is so cool that 4/5
4,"response to ""ohh rome if you want to""","the opening credits of the movie i think has the song by the B-52's an early 90's band and it is not ""Rome if you want to"" it is ""Roam if you want to"" i am not sure of the title but i hope this helps. and oh yes my younger sister and I really enjoyed the movie, there was a wide demographic at the theater and it is not only for the diney crowd, it was just fun to see the different places rome being shown in the movie."
5,The Lizzie Mcguire Movie,I think that it is a really good film and the CD is great! My favourite part is when Lizzie and Isabella sing together.Its a really good film and anyone will enjoy it!
4,Good Soundtrack!,"This soundtrack has a lot of good songs on it. Some of my favorites include: ""Why Not"" (Hilary Duff), ""The Tide Is High"" (Atomic Kitten), ""Volare"" (Vitamin C), and ""What Dreams Are Made Of"" (Hilary Duff). If you like pop music, which this basically all is, you just might love this CD!"
3,okay becuz....,"Though Hilary Duff isent the best singer the computers make her music enjoyable. You'll notice in all of her songs there's computer effects so you can never hear her sing without it. But it's still an okay cd. If your interested in singers from disney channel try Lizzie Mcguire's Lalaine on the original disney channel movie ""You wish"". Lalaine sings for the movie. And there is no computerized effects. (Raven from ""thats so raven"" also sings well."
