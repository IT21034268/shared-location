4,Powerful Hagiography,"A very powerful movie. Hardly fair in its approach to the politics and rivalries involved, though. Still a must-see for F1 fans."
2,"Excellent documentary, unfortunately does not have subtitles in Spanish","It's a shame and it is not clear in the product description, but the DVD does not have subtitles in Spanish or English."
1,SENNA,"I ordered this video and it is not playable in the USA. The disc format is different, so I can not say it works. The seller should have put on the description that it is European cd format, Not a happy camper!!!"
1,SENNA- special edition 2 DVD,"I am very unhappy. I bought this for my husband and he has not been able to see it. The format is a foreign dvd and cannot be played here in our US products, players. what a waste of money and misrepresentation!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,senna,"I would like to return this DVD, Senna, No Fear, No Limits, No Equal. It is for DVD players in Europe, not the USA. There must be a way to let customers easily see which products are made for DVD players in their own country. I missed that very important information."
1,Senna - Italian version,Couldn't play it. BluRay mode only which my recorder can't read. Poor description of product in that there was no mention that I found indicating this was in BluRay format only. Very disappointed. Now I have to re-order and go through the hassle of sending back a product that was poorly advertised to begin with.
3,Not good for advanced stages of osteoporosis.,I got it and found out there are numerous exercises that I could not do because of the advance stages of my osteoporosis. It would be good for people to prevent getting it.
4,Osteoporosis Protection DVD,"the exercises on here are good, but nothing new to what I've seen before. For anyone who has never exercised before, this will be great. Easy exercises for the most part. Since I have seen this DVD I can do the exercises without it because there are only afew to do and very easy to learn and remember."
1,RFID for Stupid People,"This book just goes to show you that if you tell really dumb people something plausible about a subject on which they are ignorant, they will believe just about anything. So...if you are a complete idiot and technological numbskull this is the book for you. Just put on your tin foil hat to keep the radio waves out and press on with your dreary life."
5,I read this the other night.,"I've seen a lot over the years in newspapers and industry periodicals about the progress of RFID technologies and applications and, first of all, it was interesting to find that everything I ever saw in print at one time or another in the past decade has somehow made it into this book; it's a testament to my regard for the research skills of the two authors.Second, I learned more.Don't let the unfamiliar publisher's imprint or the hyperbolic-sounding subtitle (or even the title) lead you to ignore the material inside. The details contained within are painstakingly corroborated, and the editorial efforts are first tier, articulate and concise--even tinged with occasional smatterings of dark humor (e.g., Edna's conversation with Jimmy).The political reminders are punctuated with anecdotes from campaigns in history that are too recent for comfort.I did not see a single factual error (or typo) in the book."
2,"Can't find a real conspiracy, make one up!!","This book is amusing, well written, and attempts to address the real issues of privacy. But it ultimately fails for me as it plays a little too fast and loose with the facts, is overly sensationalistic, and draws too many absurd conclusions. RFID tags, rather than 'spychips', may prove to be a bane to privacy, or they may not. I shall continue to look for a definitive, balanced view on the subject."
5,"GREAT, EASY, DISTURBING READ!","This book was extremely informative and easy to comprehend. I encourage all who read this to research and confirm the information contained within; you will be surprised and disturbed at the same time as I was. If this book doesn't get you upset and ""mad as hell"" I don't know what will. A definite must have book for all you civil libertarians!"
5,Very Informative Book,The shipping was SUPER fast. The book arrived in perfect condition and is a GREAT book that everyone should read and be aware of all the information inside it.Thanks for the fast service and very informative book.
3,"Grey is a color, too","All the reviews seem to sit on one side of the fence or the other. It is the absolutist nature of most humans to see things as black and white, when so much of life really exists in the grey area in the middle. The authors' make excellent points about the potential use and misuse of RFID. But by preaching a completely anti-RFID stance, they attempt to provoke people into a course of action that will ultimately fail. Make no mistake, RFID is here to stay. The focus of the privacy advocates should be to work with legislators, corporations and others involved in RFID to establish standards with which both sides can live.I am an engineer working on an RFID implementation for our company, and I see the benefits, and I also see the potential for misuse. I plan on ensuring that whatever I install and implement is in the best interest of all parties, to the best of my ability. After all, I like the part of life in the grey area. It really can be an amazing color."
1,The best way to show the Gospel of prosperity at work,"I wanted to read this book but after 20 pages gave up, as I noticed it's message is about some quick fixes to get you happy, in a typical American way. To make it look Christian the author mentions the word God so we can be relaxed about it.If somebody wants to be re begin to live a live with full potential that the right book is The 7 habits of the highes efficient people by Stephen Covey."
2,Not your sweet Grandma,"""Humor and beauty""? ""Rebellious,"" ""cynical,"" and ""depressing"" seem to me to describe these selections more accurately. Oh, I suppose a few of them are all right. But this is definitely not like the light stuff my grandma found so appealing in Erma Bombeck. After reading about half a dozen of these pieces, I'd had quite enough, thank you."
5,When I Am an Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple,"AWESOME!Note: I would have done a Video Comment but nooooo, ya can't! Kazoo on you! lol Just doing my job!Freida"
5,I shall wear purple as My Badge of Experience,"I first found this provacative, yet accessible collection at a local book store when I was 19. Now, I am 26, and I still cherish the prose and pictures of women's life cycles and women's power. I only hope to live to grow so gracefully bold."
3,clever but disappointing,"With a few exceptions, these vignettes of aging are from the viewpoint of young relatives of aging women. The title is a line from ""Warning,"" a poem by Jenny Joseph. Joseph proposes that one of the benefits of aging is doing as one pleases, and what will please her is not just wearing purple, but spitting where she chooses and picking other people's flowers. My mother, herself at the age that Joseph yearns for, found this so offensive that she refused to look at any other part of the book. There are a few pieces that are particularly nice, including Sarah Barnhill's ""Near Places, Far Places,"" in which a woman entering midlife begins to connect with her mother's values. The volume is riddled with the kind of typographical errors that would have easily yielded to a computer spellcheck, or even a cursory proofing. Though pleasing enough, I am of the opinion that the book is selling as well as it is on the strength of its titillating title and a charming! cover illustration."
5,great gift for a woman in your life.,"I read this book over 10 years ago. It kept coming up. I read it again. I still loved it. It makes a great gift for a woman in your life, even if it is you ;) Im older and wiser now and still love purple."
5,This is a wonderful book and I recommend it all the time.,"Old women were an important part of my growing up. This book brings recognition to the aunts, neighbors, grandmothers, and other older women who made such a difference in how I looked at growing older. I love the stories, especially the one about the two women who are friends, even if they are so diferent. When I read that story, I think the two women represent both sides of who I am.If you are afraid of growing older, read this book. It will help you understand that while its hard, its also an exciting and powerful part of our lives."
2,Don't buy it as a present...,"I bought this for my Mom based on the recommendations here and elsewhere. She accused me of trying to convince her to suicide. Apparently the tales are not particularly uplifting, but rather talk about the difficulty of life as an older woman. Whoops!"
2,Hellgate bridge,Well I normally like movies like this but this low budget movie has really bad special effects and the acting is mediocre and the positive thing would be the story itself. I would not recommend you this movie even for its low price
4,Very helpful,As an evangelical I found the book to be very informative and useful. I found it to be very fair in its handling of the issues involved. Easy to read if you have a bible handy.
2,Okay movie. Overpriced.,Must be a joke.$12 for a 30 minute movie. Trust was slip of finger. Meant to put $6. Maybe $5?Is okay movie. Thought lead actor and actress were good. Everyone else stiff. Mechanical. Script had interesting twist. Wish director or producer would have cast better. Wish could recommend seeing. But at price is at now? Avoid.
4,Finally,I had the pleasure of hearing the title track Enough is Enough on the radio once. I instantly fell in love with the smooth sound of this guys voice. I was so disappointed when the DJ did not mention the artists name. Since then I have been on a mission to find this CD!!! After literally months of searching I was elated that Amazon.com had this (IMPORT) CD. I have just reviewed the first six tracks of this cd and they are awsome!! If your in the mood for an artist with a milky voice and soulful club beats this is the album for you! Enjoy! Wanda
4,British Soul Artists Forever,"Just like his British predecessors Ephriam Lewis, Whycliffe and Junior, this soul brother has got it going on! Very silky smooth delivery. Great dance tracks. The Brit Soul revolution has begun...again!! Also check out Craig David, Stephen Simmonds and Jacksoul for further revolutions."
1,National Notary is an inept organization,"First, no one speaks English as their primary language in their customer service or insurance division. I paid for 2 day delivery, my order was received 7 (SEVEN!) days later!!! My name was mis-spelled. I tried to reach a supervisor and was told everyone in the entire company in a supervisory level was in a meeting. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS ORGANIZATION!"
5,IT'S GAS BABY!,Who cares if this cd is a package of PORTER's songs that SINATRA recorded during his years with CAPITOL?The important here is that you have a collection that you'll want to play often because it's a gasser.Try to find a better version of I'VE GOT YOU UNDER MY SKIN is virtually impossible.The added tracks are from the movies HIGH SOCIETY and CAN CAN.The fact that NELSON RIDDLE arranged and conducted all these songs tells a lot about his natural feeling for the music of COLE PORTER.FRANK has often said that he considered JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS one of the trickest songs to sing.I've always liked MIND IF I MAKE LOVE TO YOU and YOU'RE SENSATIONAL because SINATRA sang them to GRACE KELLY in HIGH SOCIETY.Lucky fellow!
5,Two Kings Together!,"Cole Porter was one of the greatest songwriters of 20th century. Frank Sinatra was one of the greatest performers of 20th century. So, must I write more?On this compilation you will find songs from Sinatra Sings For Swingin' Lovers (I've Got You Under My Skin, Anything Goes), High Society soundtrack (Mind If I Make Love To You, You're Sensational), A Swingin' Affair! (Night And Day, You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To, At Long Last Love, From This Moment On), Can-Can (I Love Paris, C'est Magnifique).But even if you have all this albums, this one you should by too."
2,Not so much,"I bought this to go with my Optivisor since the Optivisor has no light source and you really need one. I bought mine specifically to remove splinters from my son's hands. This visor light clips on and it's little battery clips onto the side of the visor. But I found that if I bump the battery pack it will fall right off. And the little flashlight can sometimes be difficult to turn on. The end twists on and off for light. The light wavers too at times and is not all that bright. It should be an LED which would be a lot brighter. I find that I simply forego this dumb gimmiky flashlight and have someone hold the LED flashlight I have instead.So I wouldn't waste my money on this set up, it just doesn't do the job if you really need to see something tiny in very bright light."
2,Lacking,Gives a very small spot of bright light. Really should be more of a flood. But Optivisors are simply the best tool ever.
4,The Runaways Kick Into High Gear,"""The Runaways"" are an eclectic set of young heroes - multi-cultural and edgy - a younger, sexier version of the Fantastic Four. Vaughan even writes some self-parody when the kids say, ""These disguises make us look like those politically correct, multi-ethnic gangs that only rob people in bad TV shows."" At this point, we know that their parents may be super-villains or they may be super-heroes. The dialogue is the sometimes witty, sometimes indulgent. Vaughan sprinkles his dialogue with allusions to pop culture, art, music, TV and movies.Volume Three kicks into high gear. This is the fastest paced of the stories so far. I won't write any spoilers, but suffice it to say we know who the mole is with the kids. We get so much plot development that by the end of this volume, the series almost feels over.What can Vaughan have waiting for us in Volume 4?"
4,"Volume 3 of the First Writing, Ran Away...",I love the story of the Runaways and this is the Manga/Trade Paperback version of the first group of writings. It is the last volume before the next grouping of writings start and its a doozy. It will leave you on the edge of your seat... trust me.
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Really excellent all ages superhero stories. This picks up again from the fist volume, with some unexpected about turns, some new revelations, some new antagonists, new locations, and run-ins with adults and other well-meaning types. The Runaways, of course, resist, thinking they know best for them. In this case, they probably do."
2,This is for angsty teenagers,"Runaways is a series targetted for teenagers. The writing and drawings are clearly delineated at that market segment.In this concluding book on the first Runaways series, some insight is given into how the evil parents of the teenagers first came about. The flashbacks go as follows: all 6 pairs of parents were summoned by some voice and materialise into some cavern. There, they meet 3 semi-deities drawn to look like large cloven hoofed mammaloids in clerical garb. They introduce themselves as the ""Gibberins"". It pretty much sums up this series."
2,"The comic is great, but the book sucks.","Let me just state now that I love this comic. If you haven’t read it you should. However, the quality of these books is horrible. They are printed on paper that feels like cardboard, the pages are much smaller than a normal comic (I admit this is my fault for not reading the description carefully, but it could have been made more obvious in the description), and worst of all THE BOOK FALLS APART!I have ordered the first 3 volumes of this series and all three has lost pages, or their covers are falling off. I treat my books very well, but this is just unavoidable with these books. I even returned the worst one I had for a new one, and sure enough it started to lose pages within a few minutes.I wouldn’t buy these cheaper trades. You may save money, but it is not a good deal. You will most likely get only one reading out of them before they fall apart."
4,Satisfying conclusion to 18-issue mega arc,"""Runaways"" initially had an 18-issue run, and these 18 issues are basically one big story. The heroines and heroes finally confront their parents' true legacy. The payoffs are quite big and set up the subsequent follow-up series quite well."
3,Search for a missing half.,"In this in-family adoption (the grandparents adopted the out-of-wedlock child) the adoptee knew her birth mother and had many questions answered, but always wondered who her father was -- the one secret her birth mother refused to share. Practically at death's door, her birth mother finally admitted who the father was, and Cheryl's search began to find an ending. This book should be read by families who are faced with an unplanned pregnancy and think that ""keeping it in the family"" is best. The author tells her story with much insight and pathos. It is easy to imagine her hunger for the truth. Her journey is to self-acceptance, and she arrives, finally, and is able to share her love for the missing parent she always wondered about. The book could have used a good editor to hone it into shape, but as a raw manuscript, it has value."
3,Good value,These buckets are great for storing toys. They're sturdy enough for both my three year old and my nine month old. I just wish that you could pick the colors.
4,Great adventure for first-time players,"One of the finest and rarest adventures for Basic D&D! It's so much fun to play through that I've begun many AD&D campaigns here (the conversion is simple). The mage Kavorquian (hehe!) has fallen, and his legacy must be recovered from his mysterious stronghold, and bequeathed to the rightful heir. Easy, right? If you only knew... ;) Can be used as the sequel to B11, or by itself, for levels 1-3."
3,OK except for the needles and thread.,"Mechanically, this kit is compact, convenient and cheap. The round plastic needle dispensor was too frozen to rotate so I cold not get the needles out. Oh well, I have other needles. The spools of thread were unusual in that I could find no loose ends to allow the thread to be taken off the spools. Normally, I expect a notch in one end of the spool to hold the loose end. Not with these. Maybe it is some kind of a puzzle. Some day, I'll try to figure it out. Good thing I have other spools of thread."
3,"has what you need, case is a bit flimsy, thread doesn't stay in place","For the products included, you get what you probably need from it. Lots of small things like buttons and pins, plenty of thread and needles, has scissors, etc. The case would be great if it wasn't quite as flimsy as it is. If you aren't careful, when you open the case it could just ""all fall down"" and spill things, so open slowly and carefully. Also the pins that hold the thread in place have nothing to keep them there, they're just ""resting"" on them, so they often will fall off when you open the case.I would also like to mention that I would not use this as a travel case. It's small, sure, but the plastic isn't strong and it could easily break with any pressure applied to the sides. Keep this in a drawer or basket at home only would be my suggestion.-D"
2,Piece of junk,"Very poorly made. Falls apart on first use. Even though it is inexpensive, it is a waste of your money."
4,Flora Q2,"This was prescribed by my doctor to control some bloating after a stomach infection. It worked well. Also, it does not have L.Casei in it. There is one study showing that L.Casei increases the inflammatory reaction to wheat. I am gluten intolerant so this study result could be very important. Flora Q2 also states on the bottle that it is gluten free - a very rare but nice piece of information for supplement and medicine suppliers to provide. The problem is, it's expensive."
1,Flora Q,"We never received the item and also only one follow up from supplier after three email. Per supplier this is a recall item and they waived the charges.Question was if they delivered the item, which I never received the answer back from supplier."
5,to fun!,My son is 5yo and within a week could draw anything from this dvd. Simple step by step instructions. Because it is VeggieTaless it is safe for a parent to put on and leave the room. It also has given great confident for an very art inclined little man.
4,A review that may help you decide,-----------------------------------------------------------------This is the second DVD of the Pegasus Collection Series. It has 6 episoded.Sailor Moon along with Mini-Moon continues to fight and foil the Amazon Trio's attempts to capture the One (Pegasus)and destroy people with beautiful dreams (since Pegasus can still hide in them).This DVD gets 4 stars: It is exactly like the first DVD.
1,"Cute, but that's all","I am a HUGE fan of Sailor Moon and I have to say that I was utterly disappointed when I got this. I received this, as well as Sailor Moon SuperS Pegasus Collections 1,3, and 5 for Christmas of 2002.I had high expectations for the series at first, but those high expectations suddenly turned to low ones.This has to be the worst Sailor Moon season by far.It is completely boring and focuses mainly on Chibiusa and Pegasus.If you want to watch a good Sailor Moon season, watch either the first season (Sailor Moon) or the third (S)."
1,PowerPads are CHEAP...Ante up for the real MS controller,"PowerPads are cheap... and I mean cheap, not inexpensive. They cost less than the Microsoft controllers for a reason. They are poorly constructed. Myself and 3 of my friends have purchased these controllers, and in each case, the buttons have worn out quickly. Within days the ""A"" button on my controller began to malfunction, resulting in difficult play in games where the pressure-sensitivity is crucial (DOA 3). I took the controller back and got a real one. I suggest you save the time of returning this controller and just buy a quality one from the start."
1,Just buy a offical Microsoft Controller-S,"I dont own this stupid third party controller, but why would I need to? Third party controllers never hold up well and they are never near the quality of the first party controllers. It doesent even seem shaped as good as the offical Microsoft controller-s, and it may have that nasty feel that some third party controllers have. Want to know why this is cheap? Its because its probably horrible. Every one I know who had to deal with a third party controller never liked it. So just dont buy it!"
3,Good Product - Terrible Packaging,"I really like the cleanser itself, but as others have commented it's very watery. I don't mind the consistency but due to the flip top lid, it's impossible to control how much is dispensed. It should be sold in a pump container."
5,El Manantial DVD worth it!,"This was one of the really good novelas shown on TV. The producer, Carla Estrada, is known for her great productions, including her more recent 'Amor Real' (the very best!). I recommend this DVD. I just wish it were longer. I'd be willing to pay more for, say, a set of 3 or 4 DVD's to get more of the story."
3,El Manatial,"La historia de la novela es muy buena pero la ediccion muy mala no se porque porque edditan las novelas hasta el punto que uno pierde el trayecto de la historia, en realidad esta muy corta."
3,Not what I expected,The DVD was too short. It didn't contain the original soundtracks from the original novela. The sound was horrible.
2,"Good acting from Adela, bad editing","I usually like anything with Adela Noriega in it, so I was excited to purchase this. I'm sure if I had watched this on television every night, I would have liked it more than watching the DVD of it. It was too short, and whoever edited it did a bad job because it was so choppy. Character introductions weren't made, and I ended up thinking to myself ""Who's that person?"". It will be obvious to the viewer that a lot of the story is missing. Also, there are no subtitles on this, so it does not help someone who is trying to learn Spanish, like me."
3,Comentario sobre la Edicion en Dvd de El Manantial,"Me Gusto Mucho el Dvd, esta bien editado y contiene Lo Mejor de la Telenovela.Con esta Edicion paso lo mismo que con Abrazame muy Fuerte, en la Portada dice que contiene mas de 300 Minutos y en verdad dura menos, en este caso son 280 Minutos de Resumenes de El Manantial, como dice en la parte trasera (no delantera), y en Abrazame muy Fuerte eran 267 Minutos (no 300).En sintesis le faltan muchas escenas buenas, pero el Resumen no esta mal, aunque hubiese preferido que dejaran algunas mas, que varias personas como yo recordamos y valoramos mucho.Por otra parte si me molesto que no dejaran el tema original de la Novela, el de Luis Miguel, Amor amor amor, ya que tiene otra cancion que la canta una mujer y la verdad no me gusta mucho, otra cosa a destacar es la musica incidental no es igual que la original, pero no esta mal despues de todo, es buena dentro de lo que cabe."
2,manantial!!!,The full version was better the story and the trama is good byt the dvd version is too short is not worth your money and time to watch it it is just 4 hour long and edited terribly. would not recomend to buy it.
2,Not for Novices,"This book dishes out a lot of information in the small space between it's paperback covers. I read it looking for film lighting basics, and had a tough time grasping some of the more technical language involving exposure, T-stops, etc, even though I have a decent background in photography. The book does a poor job of addressing and explaining these key concepts. I gleaned a decent amount of information from the pictures and diagrams, but they were poorly aligned with the text, requiring lots of flipping back and forth. All in all, I would reccommend this book only to people with a fair amount of knowledge of the physics behind photography and/or film."
1,Not what I ordered.,"The item that I ordered was smaller than expected and the wrong thing. I ordered an elephant, and it said elephant on my receipt, but what I got was a hippo. I was very dissatisfied."
2,Did not enjoy,"I am not sure what exactly I expected when I bought this book, but it is not nearly as interesting or humorous as I expected. I wouldn't recommend this personally."
4,Very funny look at medicine,"I love books that are made up of anecdotes - and this one is terrific. I've been interested in medicine since my mom is a nurse, and I'm addicted to watching ER, and this was a great, quick read."
2,"Kill us with how terribly clever you as, Oscar.","I am obviously out of step with the opinions of the other readers. I am in the medical field, and this may affect how I view this book ( although I ADORED House of God). I felt like the author wrote this book so he could admire how very clever he was, like a vain person who is always checking him/herself out in the store windows when walking by. Just to smug."
2,Self-inflated,"As a physician, I found this book offensive and boring. From what I can gleen from his book, Dr. London seems to be a substance abusing, self-inflated, autocratic premadonna who probably can't hang on to his office staff. He is certainly his biggest fan. In his defense, I found a few (very few) informative chapters in his book that wound be considered ""pearls of wisdon"". I'm glad I borrowed the book from someone, but most of it was a waste of my time. My father found it to be very entertaining, however. But maybe he likes old physicians who have out-dated thoughts on medicine."
5,Personal view,"As someone who knows Marvin, this has been the hardest thing for him to go through. He is the sweetest and kindest man you will ever meet. This story just proves that bad things do happen to good people. Only a parent can truly understand what its like to lose your child. This book will help those who don't to understand what its like."
3,WHO WILL CRY FOR STACI?,"I thought the first half of the book was interesting, but as I kept reading it got so boring I couldn't even finish it."
1,Not exactly accurate.,"An innocent man is paying for someone else's crime, thanks to our unjust judicial system. No matter what was 'found' in the trial, you're blaming the wrong person. But I guess God has a weird way of punishing everyone, right."
4,Quagmire Rules!,"Very cool little flick, I really enjoyed seeing seeing some of the sights and sounds of Amsterdam. Rex Xanders is way too cool. I think the mushroom shop scene might just be a new film classic. Excellent soundtrack by The Lost Vegas. If you're looking for something off the beaten path, you won't be disappointed."
3,tame,This could be Tangerine Dream from the mid-seventies . It just ambles along without much interesting happening . In need of a few chord changes or time signature changes or experimenting with major/minor or ...
4,Better than I thought it would be.,"Admittedly, I had rather low expectations for this film. I find Russell Brand annoying and a little scary. On the other hand, I love Helen Mirren, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Glad I did, Mr. Brand won me over. Amid a sea of tiresome remakes, Author 2011 is a standout and yes, I love the original too. Obviously, there is nothing deep going on here but if you want a good RoCom, this is your ticket."
1,Crap!,Serious complete waste of money. I had very high hopes but this is just plain disappointment! Do not buy this movie or even rent it.
3,Original much better IMO,"I think this new Arthur movie has some merit (several good laughs with many new lines, and some from the original movie mixed in) but a lot of the key scenes which make up the plot were not well written or enacted. The characters in this remake seem more cliche, so the relationships between the characters do not click as in the original. Maybe this version works better if one has not seen the original. Having seen both, I think the original is much better. Dudley Moore plays a great Arthur (it was hard to tell the difference between the sober and drunk Arthur with Brand), and Hobson(John Gielgud)was a riot in the original. Since you can't rate half stars, I gave it 3, but 2 1/2 stars is really all it deserves."
2,Arthur,This was a poor remake of Arthur. Although I felt that it would be just had to see it anyway. should have rented it
1,"Paid for movie wouldn,t download.","Paid for movie wouldn,t download. tryed on all my devices. the unbox won,t work with any of my computers.for movies i,m sticking with itunes.now i can,t even buy the movie."
1,You have to get drunk to like this one. Worst movie of 2011.,"Rated ""PG-13"". Running Time: one hour, 49 mins.My only reason for seeing this movie is because Luis Guzman is in it. He plays ""Bitterman"".Horrible remake to the original ""Arthur"" movies. The dearly missed Dudley Moore was in the original movie as the short drunk and was very funny, in fact, he also did a second movie.This remake with Russell Brand was very difficult to get through and only made me miss Dudley Moore even more.Luis Guzman was cute in the Robin-The Boy Wonder costume.Also in the cast: Helen Mirren, Jennifer Garner, Greta Gerwig, Nick Nolte, Evander Holyfield, Robert Clohessy.For a good time and many laughs, please see the two original movies starring Dudley Moore and Liza Minnelli.Arthur(1981).Arthur 2 - On the Rocks(1988).Both movies on Blu-ray:Arthur / Arthur 2: On the Rocks (2-Movie Collection) [Blu-ray]."
5,hilarious,I would recommend this to anyone looking for a laugh. This is truly a charming comedy. Definitely a must see!
4,good price,This was for my 25 yr old daughter. Somewhat of a cute comedy. probably better than the Dudley Moore version
3,aruthur,I liked the movie never been able to understand russell brand so I would have to say the original was better.
1,Ugh! Wouldn't Recommend,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I had high hopes it would mirror the original, but it just came off as boring and not all that funny."
1,Save the 2 hours of your time PLEASE....,"I watched this movie on a flight back from Europe and it was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Honeslty, do something more pleasurable than watch this movie, like taking a hammer and repeatedly hitting yourself on the head. Russell Brand should be ashamed for being apart of this movie, however based on his other movie roles it is pretty obvious the guy has no shame. Don't bother with this one, and consider yourself lucky."
2,Not Funny,"This movie was not funny at all. The only movie Russell Brand made that I really liked was 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. On this movie he portrays a rich childish man who has a drinking problem.His mother puts him in a position to choose money or his true love. The whole movie is based on this simplistic formula. His nanny Hobson makes all important decisions for him.The movie is super unrealistic in that he is throwing away money like it is nothing. Well if he was living like that he would not be rich.I can see that a movie like this might be appealing to some women giving them the false idea that a rich person could fall for some random, not so pretty woman on the street. This idea is not such a bad idea in itself but in here it does not work. Every scene looks staged and fake.I don't know, this movie did not work for me."
4,Better Than the Original!!!,"I'm sorry to say that I liked the remake a little better than the classic 1981 version. This movie made me care more about the characters, and had more of an emotional storyline concerning one of the characters. Russell Brand was awesome and hilarious as Arthur Bach, a drunken millionaire who is being forced to marry against his will. Arthur is so loveable and very childish and is taken care of by his sweet but strict nanny, Hobson.Because his mother is tired of his wreckless ways, Arthur is forced to marry Susan. He ends up meeting Naomi, and falls in love with her, but if he doesn't marry Susan, he will be cut off from all the money. I highly recommend ARTHUR!!!"
1,Disappointing,"This movie does a great disservice to the original. Brand is not funny, has no where near the charm of Dudley Moore and appears more stoned than drunk. Greta Gerwig, while a lovely and charming actress lacks the talent to fill Liza Minnelli's shoes. I waited for the comedy which finely came near the end. Disappointed in the movie and hope they never try for the sequel."
1,Another Remake No One Wanted,"The world was not clamoring for an update of the Oscar-winning ""Arthur"" (1981), but Warner Bros. didn't listen. Russell Brand delivers zero laughs in the Dudley Moore role, with Helen Mirren a decidedly bizarre choice to fill the shoes of John Gielgud. Sitcom director Jason Winer gives the 2011 version a predictable made-for-TV veneer. Best that you can do . . . is avoid."
5,"Simple hilarity, a great update of a comedy classic","It's not the Aurthur of old, but that in no way detracts from this fun and heartfelt comedy. Russel Brand is disarmingly funny, carefree and often hilarious and imitates Dudley Moore's accent and drunken antics brilliantly. Greta Gerwig is absolutely fantastic. Sweet, charming, with adorable smiles and moments that will charm your socks off. She plays her role in a completely different manner than the classic Liza Minnelli portrayal, but the effect is a more sincere (if a less less comically absurd) story. Helen Mirren is, of course, brilliant. The choice to change the sex of some of the characters (mother instead of father, Hobson as a woman) brings another more emotive quality to the story. It's quite good.This isn't the same Arthur. But it's fun, funny, sweet, and will get you deep down if you give it half a chance. We loved it."
3,Eh,"This movie was supposed to have a plot, but I found it hard to get into. The story felt rather contrived, and the ending was way cliched, even the twist was predictable. If you like Russell Brand, then you should like this movie, but I found the film hard to enjoy. Eh."
2,Not as Heartfelt as Origina;,"Sure, it is fun to see the new Arthur throw away money on stupid, fun things, but the original really had us feeling 'sorry' for the poor little rich boy who just wnated to be loved. Helen Mirren was a very interesting reinterpretation of Hobson, but the magic between Moore and Geilgud cannot be replaced. Even Bitterman in the original had an aire of dignity which is lacking here. We really felt it when Hobson died in the original--all the scenes here felt rushed. This is a very watered down remake just going throught the motions, the 'presence' is just not there and I don't feel any sympathy towards Arthur as I did Moore's character. Not having Arthur's eccentric grandmother Martha was a disappointment and I think Mirren could have pulled that role off even better."
2,Mirren & Writers,"There are two positives to this movie - the script writers and Helen Mirren.As far as script there were a few more uniquely humorous lines that I was expecting; perhaps totaling about 30% of the spoken lines. So that's a little star.Then there's Helen Mirren's nuanced performance which actually carried the show and that's another little star.OK, ran out of little stars because the rest of the flim was rollercoaster predictable - been there, seen that, done that NY film industry predictable. As usual, appropriately dumbed down for it's target income demographic."
1,Received the wrong version,"I ordered the Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital copy and received only the Blu-Ray version. I will be contacting Amazon to hopefully get the right version."
2,WHY!!!,"After seeing this movie(thankfully I didn't have to pay for seeing it), I have but one question. WHY did they make a second version of this movie? Dudley Moore would turn over in his grave if he saw the latest ""Arthur"". What has happened to the creative people in Hollywood? Do they only live for making money and they think the public is a bunch of brainless sheep who will watch any dreck that is put on the screen? They must as there is so much garbage out there that is more or less a bunch of bad jokes that are mostly computer generated images strip mined from comic books, video games and pitiful remakes of earlier hits. What will the ""writers"" do when Stan Lee finally dies? Will movies stop being made altogether?"
1,Terrible Movie,At the suggestion of my girlfriend I bought this movie. Halfway through we commented how terrible--and not funny--this movie is. We decided to give it away. The question is which person should get it and not be angry with us for giving them this awful flick. We decided to make a quiet donation to the public library. Please!! Save your money! Don't even rent it.
1,Don't Waste your time,You caoonet re-maike a classic with Russal in the lead and some films are just not meant to be re-made.
2,Arthur,"I hated this movie.I thought it was dull,not funny at all and the acting was bad except for Helen Mirren.Let me say that I didn't like the orginal either but this remake was even worse.I like some of Russell Brand's other movies so I decided to give it a chance even though I didn't care for the orginal or remakes in general but even Russell couldn't save this movie."
1,Travesty! An absolute TRAVESTY!,"I'm sorry if you enjoyed this movie, and please don't take this as anything personal towards you,but for me personally, this ""remake"" was a travesty! An absolute TRAVESTY!If you've seen the Original, Starring John Gielgud and Dudley Moore,then you can probably understand where I'm coming from.You might not agree with me, but I hope you can at least understand.If they had simply named this movie something else, I'd have no problem with it all...I still wouldn't like it, but I'd have no problem with it being made.But I just can't accept this movie as a ""remake"" of such an absolute classic.The relationship between John Gielgud and Dudley Moore is a masterpiece in itself!...ehhh, I could go one for hours, suffice to say I hate this ""remake"" with all my heart.I'm just saying.Cheers... and don't you wish you were me? Hahhh! I know I do!(that was just for my fellow Original lovers)"
2,Ok he was funny but how can you remake Dudley Moores character,I like the English humor and am a huge fan of many Uk actors. But it was hard to see this after Moores character brought tears to my eyes I was laughing so hard. When I saw the first Arthur in the 1980's everyone was laughing so hard that you could not hear all the lines . Everyone I knew went back to see it again it was so good. If you remember a film like this from so long ago it is hard to watch a remake of it. Love Mirren as always but go see the first Arthur to knock your socks off.
3,"Lame, but not offensive","This is a completely unnecessary Hollywood re-boot of the 1981 film starring Dudley Moore. That one wasn't really too funny, either, so why did they re-make this one? I like Russell Brand, but he's the whole show here and he's not too funny. But I blame it on the script, in fact, the whole concept of a rich boy who doesn't know what to do with himself when his rich mommy tries to cut him off if he won't marry a suitable woman. Meh. I didn't even chuckle once. You won't either."
3,"Great scenery, when you actually get a chance to look at it","I watched this DVD shortly after returning from 7 months straight of traveling around Asia, India/Nepal, Arabia, and Australia. I started it up with much anticipation, hoping it would wet my appetite (Which needed and continues to get a rest at the moment) for more travel to places further afield.Unfortunately, I have to agree with an earlier reviewer. The video skips around so fast and frequently that hardly enough time is given to enjoying the manificient landscapes that the video team traveled too. I found myself replaying certain sections and pressing the pause button. This video could have been so much more. They started with a great idea.The off the beaten path destinations themselves make me give this video 3 stars. Perhaps the preferred IMAX feature length does not lend itself to such a video that travels to numerous places. Perhaps if the team concentrated on 1/2 as many places the result would have been better."
5,"ella's rock, soul, and jazz masterpiece","famed producer richard perry produced this ella classic rock, pop and soul collection of neilson,motown,beatles and other great 60's song's that ella makes completely her own-i went to see ella numerous times in la from the late 60' to the late 80's and even got a autograph on the cover of my original copy of ella that i cherish to this day!! she was so kind when i came face to face with her and she was gracious to her fans in person-when i got to see her at the now grove with the DUKE at the piano, that was truly sublime!!! the companion lp in this release is ella with the big band master gerald wilson at the helm and the results is classic ella jazz set-enjoy as this is truly as good as it gets!!!"
1,What a sad misuse of Ella and her talent,This album is a disaster. It's an insult to Ella and all the great music she created. It's an effort to make Ella into a singer she never was and never should have been. It's no wonder that Ella left Reprise. This album is a total zero. It should never have been produced or released. A shame.
5,Great movie!,"If you or a family member has ever suffered from depression, you must see this movie. Quiet but so powerful."
3,"OK toy, not so good model","Star Trek Strike Force was a line of toys with some detail to pass as a model ... sort of.Of this line, the Cardasian Warship is OK. The nice thing about this toy is that the bridge rotates and the tail moves up/down. Since it is a toy, you could open the compartment behind the bridge to reveal two seats for poseable mini figures. However, it includes a stand for display.This is a good toy, but just OK as a model."
2,Pokemon Tattoo Series 2 (Tattoo Activity).,"I bought 2 of this series for my kids, who thought the were great, but did anyone else but me notice that the cover boasts ""150 tattoos!"", yet if you actually count them there are only 50! You have to buy all 3 in the series to get the 150! Very misleading! Though the kids did not mind, I feel it is a rip-off!"
3,"It's a barbie.. very pretty, no educational value..","its a barbie, very pretty, no educational value, but any little girl should enjoy playing with it. im sure its little earings would be lost over time, but it should be appreciated, i know when i was little, the accesories never lasted long :)"
5,Best pack you can get,i got this pack while in germany for 16 euro. BEST DEAL YOU CAN GET ANYWERE! i sugest this to anyone who is a trance fan!
4,EASY TO INSTALL!,"SO FAR SO GOOD. SLIGHTLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE FINISH, BUT FOR THE PRICE IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT. INSTALL WAS SUPER EASY!"
5,Cleared up chronic ear infections.,"Our local pet store owner suggested this food when I showed her my dachshunds ears that were red, inflamed and never seemed to clear up even after I don't know how many antibiotics our vet prescribed. Within a few weeks they were totally cleared up and we never had the problem again.Also, he used to get hot itchy spots on his belly in the summer and those never came back either. I highly recommend it!"
2,CHANGED THEIR FORMULA - MAKES DOGS SICK,"Our boxer was on Natural Balance Duck and Potato for years and did very well on it. After they changed the formula, he experienced horrible vomiting and diarrhea. He has also had an major increase in skin irritation (ear itching and paw chewing). The change in the formula was not made apparent by the company for months. Later they indicated the changed with a small sticker on the bag. Very disappointed in the company and hoping that no permanent damage has been caused to our pup."
1,"My dog will eat everything, except for this.","My dog NEVER refuses food. For years she'll eat pretty much anything, but not this. That, combined with some of the other frightening customer reviews, worries me. Maybe it was once good and they changed the formula, or maybe my experience is just a fluke. But for whatever reason, my hungry dog would rather eat just about anything that I've ever given her instead of this food."
1,Should have heeded warnings...,"I read all of the reviews I could find about this food, and despite the warnings, we started one dog on this food because of suspected grain allergies. His ear/paw infections quickly cleared up and he seemed healthier than ever. We fed him this for about 6 months without a problem. About a month ago, we decided to transition our other dog onto it, as well.About 3 weeks ago both dogs started to get very sick - the worst diarrhea I've seen. It started with one dog, so we took him to the vet. After screens for parasites and bacterial infections turned up nothing, and antibiotics weren't helping, the other dog also became ill. On the off chance it was the new bag of food we had recently opened, we fed them something different one day. Within 24 hours both dogs were fine. I don't know if it's simply inconsistencies in their production, but I cannot take the chance that I might poison my dogs with a bad bag of food. We will no longer feed them any Natural Balance food."
1,Gives my dog diarrhea!!!,"I purchased this food assuming my dog would love it, but he totally hates it. And when he does eat it because I am feeding it to him he gets really bad diarrhea even with a small amount. I will NEVER purchase this food again, it should be call Diarrhea Balance."
5,A seminal work,"With agile methodologies now firmly in the mainstream, Jim has written an important work that addresses their management. He demystifies agile project management with guiding principles for leadership-collaboration and an APM model focused on delivery and adaptation.If you are a manager responsible for projects that face changing requirements and new technologies, this book can help you understand what it takes to respond with innovation and reliable business results.If you are new to agile methodologies, don't balk: this book also serves as a great introduction for managers looking to get agile projects up and running quickly."
3,A bit disappointing,"This book is well-written and provides both a good explanation of agile software development and insights into how to manage such a project. My disappointment comes from fact that Highsmith emphasizes that one has to find the right people in order to succeed with this kind of project, and doesn't provide much info about how to identify the right people or how to train people with potential to work this way. Given the emphasis on the importance of the right team, more space in the book should be devoted to that aspect of management."
5,"worthwhile, for sure","Good video and sound quality, I am glad I have this to supplement the bootlegs and cable-tv tapes I've made over the years. I didn't recall that Burt Bacharach sings the first half of his duet with Dusty on ""A House is not a Home,"" and she muffs one word. But she hits every note beautifully, and I'll re-watch it often, I am sure."
2,Car charger unusable,"We each have a Zen, so ordered two of these. Items arrived quickly, no hassles. Both wall chargers work, but one arrived with a broken case and loose parts rattling around inside.Both car chargers are the same: They emit a loud high pitched noise that is insufferable, and further they interfere with all audio electronic devices, e.g. they completely killed my FRS radio (wouldn't work at all with the car charger in use, and it isn't even plugged into the same system, just in the same vehicle), made lots of noisy static on all FM stations, and even made the Zen have awful static when used with a headset (no radio involved).So possibly this could be used to charge the player, never even got that far with it, if you weren't in the car at the time or maybe if you had a really good set of earplugs in, but you aren't going to be driving down the road listening to your Zen with this thing plugged in!"
1,Don't fit in my Zen Vision M,"I ordered these from Amazon with vendor SF Planet. The car charger, which is what I wanted, doesn't fit in my Zen Vision M. It also doesn't fit in my sister's Zen Vision M. According to the packing slip, it's supposed to work with this particular Zen series. My sister warned me not to buy except directly from Creative Labs. That is where I'm going now."
5,As it is...,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Tomorrow's Catholic"". I had borrowed a copy from a friend and after reading it, I knew I needed a copy of my own. I believe Fr. Morwood hit the nail on the head. We no longer live in the medieval period and it's time for the Catholic church to come forward in time, beliefs and meaning. The Christian faith can be so much more than what we are supposed to accept for truth. Vatican II was moving us forward and now we have fallen back to the dark ages. Terrific book! I will be reading more of Morwood's books."
5,Liberated Catholic,"It takes courage to write this kind of book. Much of this material can be heard in Theology classes, but only Michael Morwood took it upon himself to shout it from the mountain tops. Of course what he wrote was disturbing, because truth is disturbing; but truth will set you free.Christ did the same kind of distubance to Judaism during his time, and that was why he was crucified. Since crucifixion is now out of practice, hence the author was crucified with poor reviews.Take it from the reviews on the first few pages of the book. I got my copy from Elizabeth's in Fremantle and there are four pages of ""Praise"" from priests, religious, nuns, theologians, writers, parishioners; and in this forum, from yours truly."
1,uncontroversial trash,"This book is about as controversial as People Magazine - with none of the intellectual content. Here's a mind shattering excerpt: ""For many adult Catholics, the reforms of Vatican II, as well as the Vietnam War and the church's teaching against contraception, shattered a prided sense of uniformity of belief and practice."" What? Vietnam war? A prided sense of uniformity?It is no wonder why the archbishop of Melbourne concluded his condemnation of the book with, ""[Morwood's] limited understanding both of classical theologies and contemporary science is evident to any informed reader."" Don't waste your money on this one. If you're looking for heresies, there's a lot better ones out there."
2,really 2 1/2 stars,"The idea that the church is moving into a different epoch is a true one. My feeling is that the Church will come to grips with certain scientific ideas to broaden its mission. This book was good at describing some of those ideas BUT was not in any way original. I wouldn't call it trash, but I would say that I am glad I read Hans Kung and other theologians for their original content."
2,Love my Angels but.......,My niece got me this collection for xmas cause I always talk about the shows Iliked growing up as a teenager. Anyway I was so excited to get it but then I opened the boxand I was very disappointed with the way DVDs were stored.They are piled on top of each otherwith no protection. All I can say is Bad Packaging!! Not even a booklet that takes you thru each season and episode!!!!
4,Transfers look great. Packaging is OK (for the price),"I actually got this set for 27.99 which (to me, no matter the packaging) is a steal! The packaging is pretty cheap but not as cheap as I was expecting based on some reviews. The discs are stacked on two spindles and that does make finding a particular disc harder to find but for the price of the ENTIRE series I'm not complaining.. The video/audio quality look really good! It's funny to me that some of the older shows look better on DVD than some newer ones from the 80s. Wouldn't it stand to reason that the older the show is, the harder it would be to remaster it? I've seen some 80s remastered tv shows that don't look or sound this good. Hint: Google search this series for the best price before buying : D"
1,Buy 5 to get 1,"I just don't understand it. I bought Seasons 1, 2 3, and 4 each when they came out. I continue to wait for season 5 to be released. Now I an expected to repurchase the first 4 season again, just to get season 5? I don't think so! Unless you want to buy back the first 4 season from me at the full prices I paid, You can keep this mess. I'm not that stupid!"
5,FINALLY,"Finally we get season 5 why has this taken so long? Now if only sony would do the same for hart to hart, tj hooker and party of 5 and just release whole series box sets of these stalled shows or at the very least sign the rights over to shout like they finally did for different strokes. Its Been way too long for all these classic series to get on dvd i for 1 would be happy to rebuy the above mentioned shows if it meant we got every episode."
3,"OK, but not more","Excellent price for all five seasons. However, the criticism in other reviews is correct. DIscs are stacked on top of each other, on two spindles, with dvd-shaped cheap pieces of carton to hold them in place. After removing this piece of carton a few times to retrieve a dvd to view, it will have bent and become useless, making it impossible to have the discs in the box. If you buy this box, expect to also have to buy ordinary dvd-cases for the discs since the box will not last very long. Summary: A great price for all five seasons, but the box the discs come in is without question the worst I have come across."
4,Good Shows,"I still love the shows all shows been playing real good but I'm still in the first season. The package was very good but the way the dvds are just stacked together doe's not seem good but I have not had a problem , other then the second half of the stack the glue came undone and I have to adjust it to keep it straight in the box. But I love seeing these shows so I am grateful to get them even if the way they are boxed is not to my liking. I had gotten the seasons of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman and Kung Fu that had the dvds separate in there own containers, and also Gidget, and Growing Pains, had a very good package to keep the discs in good condition , but I still have not had a problem so I should not say it is bad."
2,Failed designed,"Poorly designed piece - the choice of contact surface is far from ideal - bottom is almost entirely flat and the top contacts are both springed - so besides you no been able to distighuish positive from negative when inserting the batteries, it lacks good contact which results in FAIL when using it.As another buyer suggested, adding a piece of thin foils fixes it, but yet its a failure."
2,Visor Light,The light is bright but the batteries got very hot. The light also goes off and will not come back on after a certain amount of time. I would not recommend this product.
2,"OK, but not the best solution","It's interesting that this is the VisorLight by Donegan to be used on the Donegan OptiVisor, because it's not as good as some of the third party alternatives which often cost less. The battery compartment constantly pops open and the batteries lose connection or fall out. The visor clip is loose and moves around. I've had to tape the visor clip and battery case closed with tape. The lens needs to be twisted to turn the lamp on an off. If it's to loose, the lens cap can fall off, and if it's too tight the lamps may not be turned off and will drain the batteries. A switch would be a far better alternative. As far as the light source, it does provide good direct and bright lighting. Overall, the design is poor and doesn't appear that there was much thought went into the creation of the product."
1,Not a good value,"I purchased this for my 2 year old nephew, hoping that he would follow in my footsteps and learn to love the piano. I thought it was a great deal at half off considering that it was made by Melissa & Doug. As soon as I received the piano I gift-wrapped it. When I read some of the bad reviews from folks who purchased it during November, as I did, I decided to unwrap it and remove the shrinkwrap. Ewwww! The toy piano reeked of a strong odor like plastic resin. Left the shrinkwrap off a few days. It still reeked. Decided to play it. It was in tune but sounded a $10 xylophone (metallic). I was suspicious of some of the action of the keys. Didn't know if the resin smell would ever go away but I had more than enough reasons to return the monstrosity. If this had been my first exposure to piano, I'd have switched to clarinet or violin. Two weeks later and the wrapping paper I used still reeks of the resin."
3,Missing Song book,"This would have gotten a 5 star from me but the songbook was not included . I bought this in september for my sons birthday on dec 4. so by the time i realized there was no song book there is nothing I can do about it., Very disappointing. really wanted to teach my son the basic songs. I still can now i just have to look them up online and write them down ... kind of a pain. Guess I am going to look at having to buy some song books :( other than the missing song book my 2 yr old son loves this. played with it for over an hour right after he opened it.gets good use everyday :)"
5,Great!,"I orderd this product for my 1.5 year old and she loves it. I know she is a little young for it, but she loves playing it! We have only had it for approximately 1 month, so I cannot speak to its durability - but so far so good. The sound is great, as it is not too loud or ear piercing."
3,"Cute piano, but totally out of tune",I understand this piano is for kids. Is meant more for fun than nurturing a budding musician with an accurate pitch. However the octaves and cords aren't even in harmony. I had just owned it for 2 days and it is already getting on my nerve. Is there a manual out there that I can follow to tune this piano relatively? Can I open the top part? Has anyone who own this try to tune it with success? Or should I just returned it?
4,Loud but loved,We bought this piano for my younger daughter's first birthday. My older daughter had the laugh n learn piano which she loved but hers was broken and not available for purchase anymore. Both kids love to sit and play this together (age 1 and 4)Pros:-Not battery operated-Sturdy construction- Real piano actionCons:-It can get VERY loud. No volume control- My 1 year old is not completely steady on her feet yet and it has flipped over on her more than once.
4,Cute,I bought this for my son for Christmas. He really like it and my oldest one enjoy it too.The piano is well maid my only complaint is that the little line that shows the colors (notes) is not strong enough and my baby can easily take it apart. I should put some glue on it but not big deal. It was smaller that I thought it will be but my baby love it so it didn't mind.
3,Melissa & Doug Learn-To-Play Piano,One of the keys is flat - very annoying. This item is too expensive to have problems with the keyboards.
3,Ok - we aren't expecting miracles,"I thought my grandson would enjoy this more than he does - the sound is okay - but let's be honest it isn't ""ready for prime time"" but to just bang on the keys and not really care what comes out - it will work"
3,Listen before you buy,"We have the 4-key little tykes piano for my 21-month old son, which he has always loved. He has recently been really into pianos with more keys, and specifically the black-and-white keys. When we saw this, we thought it would make an excellent christmas gift as it's a ""big boy's piano"". We bought it cellaphone-wrapped, and when we got home unwrapped it, and were fairly disappointed with it's very tinny sound. We still plan on giving it to him for christmas and will write a new review then - we hope he loves it. Just a word of caution to try and listen to this particular piano before you purchase to be sure it's what you are looking for."
1,fell apart out of the box,The piano is very cute but it fell apart as my daughter was taking it out of the box to give to my grandson.
4,Fun for all ages,"This piano is great. I have three children aged 1 1/2, 3 1/2, & 4 1/2 and they love it. Be careful not to let anyone carry it by the top because it could pop off or knock it over because the keys could come loose. The only thing I would change about this piano is the paper notes. My children feel the need to pull them off. I wish they were painted on. All in all this is a great piano for the money and my children haven't stop playing with it since we got it."
2,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,"Sound is TERRIBLE. Seriously, don't minimize this fact. I read the other reviews that complained about the sound and I was like, ""How bad can it be?"" We're not musicians and I understand this is a kids toy, so I went ahead bought it.Bad choice, the sound really is that horrible. Can't really even play any songs on it because the notes are so off. Also, the second day one of the keys stopped working altogether. I opened up the piano and was able to jam the chime back into place but it's not well made.I can't imagine why people like this toy, it's a bad buy for us."
3,Not as expected,"So the LITTLE piano came today. It was a lot smaller than expected. My biggest problem and this is huge for me because my son cannot be around scented things, was the horrific smell. Even before,opening the box, I could smell it. To me, it's a combo of harsh chemicals and moth balls. I have the piano sitting in the garage to air out but an overnight airing out may not do the trick. It's definitely not worth the 50 bucks I paid for it. Would like to return it, but its too difficult for me to get it shipped out. I would definitely steer clear of this. I m hoping that he could use this soon, otherwise, it will be a big paperweight."
2,do not buy it unless its on a great sale and you really think you need this!,"i'm only glad i got it on sale at amazon for 35$ otherwise i would not be happy. its just small, looks like a toy, not kids piano. so unfortunately she doesnt pay that much attention too it as i wish and prefers a real size piano. dont waste your money on this one unless a good sale is going on.in fact what i've learned is all ""melissa and doug"" toys are small. i mean small for even 1 year old baby. the blocks? have you seen those? puzzles seem to be the only toy they make wright.check out the piano at walmart.com. look a lot more like real, its high (your child can actually sit on the chair and play) and i dont remember but the cost is about the same (or even less)!"
3,"Very cute, but small","Definitely cute but smaller than it appears in the picture. However, with it being low to the ground, I don't have to worry about the kids tipping it over..."
4,Great for the beginning musician,"Great construction quality and finish. A couple of keys are slightly off pitch, but it is a kid's toy. Also, it is made in China with all the other M & A toys. Wish this company would get it together and produce in the USA."
4,"Even at 6 months, this piano is GREAT!","This was a Christmas Gift from SANTA for our 6 month old son. It is so stable and durable for him to pull up on and play with. The only thing we've had a problem with is he will pull off the PAPER NOTE GUIDE. This is something I really feel should have been painted on or permantely attached. We took it off so that he can no longer mess with it, as for now he just loves banging on the keys and making any kind of sound. We feel like it will last til hes older as well. It is very strong, however the keys arent that IN TUNE. but for 50 bucks you cant complain about that.... being a childs piano. We just mainly got it so that he can bang on it, and for that purpose it is AWESOME!! But I feel even though hes only 6 months I think its extremely safe for younger than the age group says...3 years is just a guideline in my opinion! see our pics!!"
3,Sounds really weird - USPS guy at the APO facility warned about the sound.,"I guess I was expecting a more piano-ey sound, but it sounds like goofy bells. The hammers inside are loose so when the APO USPS guy gave me the box he told me to make sure that you couldn't hear the item inside - he said that in many cases they will assume its a bomb and get rid of it. Good thing they didn't! But, again, it just sounds weird - and its really short. THe pictures I saw of this showed a little kid sitting in front of it on a chair, which definitely isn't possible because its maybe 12"" tall."
1,Fell Apart,"I bought the piano for my twin boys (2 years old). They tore it apart in less than 2 months. The lid came off easily. I tried to repair it but within a week the boys pulled all the piano keys out. If your kid has energy, don't buy this toy."
2,poorly constructed & poor sound quality,"My 3 year old son recieved this piano for Christmas. Within one week, it was broken, and not from misuse. In order for him to move the piano, he has to pick it up by the red top. There are flimsy wooden pegs that are used to hold the red top onto the piano. These pegs broke off and now the top will not stay on. Despite the broken top, my son still likes to play with the piano and is very interested in its inner workings. The sound quality does not bother him but, it does me. I am disappointed in the quality of this toy, especially for the price I paid for it."
5,Excelent choice!,"This was a Christmas present for my 2.8 year old and was a big hit. He really loves music and my husband is a good piano player so it is a good start to learn his first steps into piano. I really like that is a traditional little piano, not complicated, not electric, just what a little kid needs, and I also think this is a really good brand for wooden toys."
3,Not Melissa & Doug quality,"The good news: Product was well enough packaged in plastic shrink wrap and end cushions, shipped a larger box with a bit of paper thrown in. No visible damage from shipping. Color and finish was good.The bad news: The top right key did not work at all. The rest of the keys were barely close to tune. The Learn to Play piano should be close enough to tune to identify with the keys while learning to play simple tunes on the little piano.Physically cute and colorful, makes fun noises, seems to be durable, but misses the point of learning to play even at a basic level."
2,tiny- not what I expected,"Expected this piano to be a lot bigger then what was portrayed in the pictures. It came with the top loose which we had to tighten upon arrival. The keys sound good, though tend to stick at times. It was bought for a destructive one year old, and I think it should be sturdy enough to withstand his wrath (I spent some time pounding away at the keys and knocking the thing over to see if it would break, which it didn't). Overall, I would NOT purchase this item again, due to its extremely small size and poor condition upon arrival (really lame that I had to re-tighten screws). Plus the keys stick. Not worth the 50 bucks!"
3,Ok toy,"Not a bad buy, but certainly not the best. It is very very small. I would not use this for a learning to play piano. Its ok as a toy though. Mine arrived with a crack, but its no big deal. I would recommend this if you would like a teeny tiny pretty poor sound quality piano."
2,"Nice Sound, Looks... Cheap Construction","I bought this toy, which was damaged in transit, and was really happy with the seller's response. I would like to not though, that this toy is very cheaply constructed and should not be described as ""durable."" The description above states that this is ""Made of hardwood"" and the packaging says ""Solid Wood Construction,"" but neither of these are true. Since mine was damaged en-route I got to see that the construction is actually some kind of pressed-paper/cellulose material, which is flimsy and not at all durable. I've also uploaded a picture illustrating this in detail.The sound is sort of harpsichord-ish and certainly adequate for the price and intended use of this toy. I also like that it is two octaves, which is more than the usual one octave you get with piano/xylophone toys. The colors are nice as well."
3,it's good for a first piano for little babies,"I got this melissa and doug learn to play piano about a month ago and my 16 month year old girl likes to play with it. The exterior is quite nice but there isn't any notes pattern at a side of the piano unlike the picture at product page.Second the sounds, actually this is nothing better than the little tikes xylophone that I purchased before.Melissa & doug may needs to improve the sounds like real piano dispite the higer price endured."
3,Smaller than I thought,"Piano is ok, just a little smaller than I would have liked.Songs were fairly easy to follow. Next time I wll definatelyread the dimensions"
4,Very nice toy,"I wish the music book were a little more robust. But...I like the piano a lot, and so does my little grandson."
2,Out of tune,It's just as adorable as it looks but the keys are so out of tune I cringe every time the kids play on it!
3,terrible ringing bell sound,"terribly loud ringing bell sound. i wish it was a softer melodious piano sound but its just a loud ringing bell sound. also a rather low height, meant to be sittin on the ground and played. i had hoped it would be a bit higher and taller so a toddler could sit in a toddler seat and play it."
5,Christmas fun,This product came on time and in new condition.My daughter loved this gift.She played with it for hours on Christmas Day and slept with it that night.
4,"Great toy, but paint odor is overwhelming","We got this as an xmas present for our daughter. It is nice looking, and the sound quality is acceptable if you keep in mind that this is a toy and not a real piano. We have two concerns. First, the black paint on the left leg chipped off right off the box (about 0.5"" in size). Second, and this is concerning, the paint smell is overwhelming when first removed from the box, and 3 days later it is not getting a lot better. We are limiting the amount of time our daughter plays with it until the smell dissipates. Other than that, so far it's a neat toy."
1,Defective,Out of the box one of the keys gets stuck every time it's pressed. Cheaply made. The keys are hard to press.
3,Pricey for what it is.,"This is nice solid wood but the paper strip with the notes on it fell off on day 2. The keys seem to sit really low like they've fallen down but it was like that from day one. It also sounds kind of cheap. I know this is meant to be more of a toy than an instrument but for the price, I was just expecting it to be a little nicer."
4,"Great Piano, but lost the sheet music.....","A very nice little piano for a toddler. Our daughter pretty much just mashes her hands on it (16 months old), but she enjoys doing that. Anyway, we lost the sheet music that comes with it. Does anyone know of a way to get the sheet music for the Melissa and Doug learn to play piano? The sheet music is letter coordinated with letters above the keys for this piano specifically."
2,I dont recommend this piano,"My 3 year old daughter received this for her birthday a few weeks ago and hasn't played with it since her party. She loves playing her Grandmothers real piano when we go to visit so I thought she would enjoy having this Learn-to-Play piano at home. It stays in the floor of her bedroom and collects dust. The piano is also very loud and annoying for the adults. On the other hand, it seems to be made very well. She sometimes like to sit on top of it and it hasn't tipped over."
3,OK toy but not worth full price,"My son loves anything musical. I bought this while it was on sale and couldn't wait to get it. It doesn't sound like a piano. It's a metallic sound. My son loves it, but the keys stick frequently. When that happens, you have to pull them back up. It also has a horrible chemical smell. The smell filled the room within minutes of opening the box. I am trying to air it out so it won't be so overwhelming (wish me luck). Also, the note label is only attached at one end so it entices little ones to tear it off. This is an ok toy for the price I paid, but definitely not worth the current price."
1,Don't Buy,After a week the screws at the top became loose and my kids were able to take it apart. The whole thing fell apart!
5,very fun!,My 3 year old was over the moon when he got his little piano. We all like it best toy ever in our book.
2,Eh,"Sound quality isn't great. The colored scale just above the key's is just a piece of paper glued on at both ends. That came off pretty quick. We've had it for a year and one of the keys is already dead. My son (now 2) likes it okay, he will go over and bang on it for a few minutes now and then but overall it takes up space. Only reason it's still around is Nana got it for him."
2,Melissa and Doug should be embarrased,"This is a shoddy, low-quality product. Not what we expect from this brand.The first one we got was broken. The second one sounded worse. It's cheaply made in every way.The ""Learn to Play"" claim is just insulting. They put letters over the keys with cheap stickers. Not exactly educational.It looks like they just repainted this product from another company: http://www.amazon.com/Schoenhut-My-First-Piano-II/dp/B000IGEEC6/This is a brand we've grown to trust. They blew it on this one."
4,fun for a toddler,"This piano is cute for a toddler. I ordered it for my 2 year old. She loves to bang on the keys and the color coding on the keys with the accompanying song book make it easy for me to play some of her favorite tunes. The size of the piano however, is not what I had expected. I thought it would be much larger... proportional to the size of a toddler. Instead, it is quite small. It is too short for my daughter to sit at with her toddler chair, but is too tall when placed on a coffee table unless she is standing up. I'm not sure how it was intended to be used, but is a good value nonetheless."
1,Defective,"The item was received well packaged in Amazon's usual overkill packaging. It took me 30 minutes just to get it out. Then, disappointment when my niece and nephew opened it up on their birthday only to find that 2/3 of the keyboard doesn't work. I don't think it was damaged in shipping, the piano otherwise looks perfect. I suspect it is either defective or poorly made such that something shook loose in the shipping. Am waiting for a replacement but I am wondering how long it will last given some of the reviews here about durability. I've seen other Melissa and Doug toys and they seem more sturdily made."
3,"Good toy, but disappointed with the quality","I was looking for a toy piano for my 1-yr daughter. Given the reputation of M&D and the good review on Amazon, I bought it. I was so looking forward to the piano, but was quite disappoint with its quality after I opened it. The paint is very colorful and attractive, but smelly. The keys are so loose and not sensitive- you have to press very hard to make sound. Some keys don't making sound properly if you press them continuously. I would recommend to spend more money on better quality toy instrument."
2,Sadly Not Well Made.,I bought this because i thought it would be great for my 18month old. Once i received it i started to play a song using the book it came with. Right away i noticed some of the keys would get stuck down which made it hard to properly play a song. Also if you tap on a key over and over it will not recognize that and make a sound such as other pianos would do. For this price i think it can be constructed way better. I returned it.It is very pretty though.
5,Fun for my a 1 year old daughter and 30 year old husband,"My daughter loves banging on it to make sounds and my husband is learning how to play kiddo songs on there for her. it sounds great, is super cute but not too big, colorful, and nothing has fallen out yet. (My 1 year old is pretty strong and tries to pry the keys out a lot). great toy!"
3,Loved toy but was lid was broken straight out of box!,"I was so excited to get this piano for my son's birthday! I figured it was a toy that both my boys could play with. But when we opened it, the red lid was already cracked. Tried to ignore and let him play with it but then the whole lid fell off. I am extremely disappointed as I have several Melissa and Doug toys, puzzles, kitchen items, which are all durably made. Hopefully can update this review with a better assessment once the replacement arrives! Here's hoping that the NEW one is not broken!"
3,Not all that fascinating,"The drawings inside the book looks scratchy to me at times. This book is basically about tone and pen techniques, like the book suggests. I personally don't think it's all that interesting. I think that a person would get pretty frustrated and annoyed with looking at this book for very long. If you really want to learn tone techniques, I would recommend Manga techniques"" tone techniques for beginners vol 6. I think this book would be better suited for teaching someone tone techs, and it's easier on the eyes. All in all, I really wouldn't recommend How to draw manga pen and tone techniques for beginners or for those who are intermidiate. This book isn't all that great. For intermidiate to advanced manga-ka's, I would also recommend How to draw manga super tone techniques. As a warning, super tone techniques has alot of nudity and sexual content."
2,WHY?!,"First, I must say, the cover page is VERY misleading. None of the art in this book is remotely like the cover. But if you strictly looking for pen techniques, this is the book for you and I highly recommend it. But if you are like me and want the book for the techniques but enjoy nice looking manga art, DON'T GET THIS. This book is teaching you how to draw lines and curves through a retarded gag manga. The characters are weird and the faces, oh my goodness, the faces, are the most hideous faces you ever want to see in a manga. But, if you look past all that, it's not that bad of a book."
1,Annoying characters,"I like this artist and yeah I know that most of the time there are annoying characters that pop up in the book but jesus christ. This whole book is like a manga, not even a good manga, more like a retarded picture book with picture and people with odd proportions. There are some good info in there...somewhere but i really DONT recommend this book."
4,Very well explained,"I bought this book recently to understand some advanced features of 10G and also get more hold on admin tasks and setups.I am not through with the entire book yet, but whatever i have red till now is really well written. All features - desktop and admin are well explained with examples and screen shots. Notes at the end of items provide special remarks which are very useful as well.A very helpful book for beginners as well as advanced users."
3,Big Oversight,"Nice selection of songs, but why could they not have included the screaming Spaghetti Western theme by Ennio Morricone, originally from the film 'Navajo Joe', that plays whenever Tracy flips out? As a big Spaghetti Western fan, this amusing use of Morricone's music made Election a great film for me."
2,The answer to a reviewer's question,"The reviewer, ""allouciksk"" asked what is the song that is the ""'tribal' war cry song thingy"" you hear in the movie but not on the Election soundtrack. That song is ""Navajo Joe"" by Ennio Morricone. The movie starred Burt Reynolds. Ennio Morricone is famous as the composer of the spaghetti westerns soundtracks which starred Clint Eastwood. ""Navajo Joe"" is on many of Morricone's compilations."
2,"What, no score?","The score for ELECTION is excellent, and it is bewildering to me that there is so little of it here. Just one track of about 7 minutes. The song choice is reasonable, but the CD is woefully inadequate for those of us who really want to revisit Rolfe Kent's great and strange music from the film. having said that, 7 minutes is better than nothing, and the suite of score is really good."
2,HELP ME,"In the movie reese gets really mad when she sees the other guy starting to run for the first time and in the backround music there is this ""Tribal"" war cry song thingie... WHAT IS IT... I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE>.. SOMEONE HELP MEEEEE!"
5,Great message,"Very thought provoking, with the right balance of humor and a great message. I had wanted to see one of Ken Davis's tapes for a long time, and was not disappointed."
5,Excellent CD with great singing and high production values.,"This is an excellent CD with 25 tracks with great singing and high production values. It contains particularly brilliant renditions of ""What Is This Thing Called Love"" by Keely Smith and ""Just One Of Those Things"" by Nat King Cole. If you could only have one Cole Porter CD, this would be the one to have! (and I have about 30 all-Porter CDs to compare against :-)"
1,viva el capitalismo,"el que es explotado lo es porque quiere...el que es pobre lo es porque quiere....no quieren salir adelante...a menos que vivan en Cuba.FIDEL...NO SEAS MAMON,,,"
3,Try the Coconut Cake,"It's a fine book. As a rank amateur & no Africanist, (with little reading in the African diaspora), I'd say it was swell in its coverage. As a cook, though, sometimes I think she uses too much coconut cream in the recipes. Surely it's not available everywhere. But (I say as someone who has no particular liking for cake) you have never, never, never in your life had such a coconut cake."
5,First attempt,"Originally released in 1991 by EMI (USA). However, Pete Byrne and the late Rob Fisher didn't feel this did their fans justice, so in 1994, they released ""Promises, Promises"" with more tracks (but ""Could Be"" was held over). This is a budget reissue. The studio albums will finally be re-released on CD, so I've heard."
3,Not Great,"First, this isn't vegan at all for anyone preferring that. Nor is this a healthy cookbook instead using lots of butter, sour cream, mayo, canned mushroom soup... in many of the recipes. No suggestions of light cooking or fresh inspired ingredients. There are much better books out there if you love mexican food."
4,"Slow start, great finish!","This is an excellent book about one of the early battles of the revolution. The battle of Bunker Hill was arguably the ""last straw"" causing the open rebellion by the Boston area to develop into a full fledged rebellion.The book details the incidents and personalities that lead up to the battle. In fact, unless you have some background, you'll find the first 100 pages pretty slow going. But, the wait is worth it! The remainder of the book is fast paced and well written. It provides the best review of the details of this battle than any other source I have read.This is a classic book, and if you want to get the whole picture of the beginning of our revolution, read ""Paul Revere's Ride"" first. They're better together!"
4,"A personal account, but interesting and well-written","Yes, I fully agree with the previous reviewer from Louisiana. This is not a book for those who want to get to know Madagascar and Malagasy culture or history. At the most, in that direction, it provides some 'atmosphere' of Africa for those who have never been there. The book is indeed a personal account of the reader's feelings, as she rediscovered herself during her trip to that wonderful Indian Ocean island. Yet, this is a good subject, and the book is well-written, filled with thrill. I liked it. As long as it is presented as what it is and not something else, I recommend it to those interested in the former."
1,Be aware of this book's true content,Over The Lip of the World is a FICTIONAL account based on the author's subjective experiences in Madagascar. It is not a recount of Malagasy folklore but rather a history of McElroy's search for her own identity as she looked for it on an island on the other side of the world. Persons interested in Malagasy studies should NOT buy this book; people interested in a black woman's personal history might find it more palatable than I did.
3,Not all it is cracked up to be...,"This had the potential to be my son's favorite toy. It had all of his favorite things, pages to turn, sound, and a block to fit places. However he became VERY Frustrated at the fact that you move the page even a little bit and it would start reading all over again. He liked to hear the song, but as soon as he would touch the page to get leverage or whatever, it would start to read. This book ended up getting thrown all over the place because it made him so mad. After a few months, I ended up giving it to my nephew. The concept is great, it can just be frustrating to a little one when they want it to do one thing and it keeps doing something else..."
5,Brilliant,I think this learning toy is a work of genius. I bought it for my 19 month old nephew and saw him in action with it recently. One of the best learning tools I've ever come across for this age group.
4,Very cute toy!,"Learn to count to 5 for babies. Great for fine motor skills for little ones. They need to match the picture on the block with the correct picture on the page, and then place the block in the hole. The block is a perfect size for little hands. Tad's voice is very soothing to hear, too. Nice book overall, but I know I didn't pay $24.99. It was less than $20.00."
5,Fabulous!!,"We bought this for my son when he was 10 months old. At the time he couldn't do much except turn the pages to hear the story and push the button to hear the song. But he loved it!!! As he got older he figured out that when Farmer Tad was looking for his cow you had to put the block in so the cow was showing. He never learned much about counting from this book, but I still think it's a great toy. The best part is probably the fact that the book ""reads itself"" to him as each page turns and needs no adult intervention. I've watched him play with this toy for 20 minutes at a time without asking for help. I highly recommend this toy and even though my son is now 3 I would replace ours in a heartbeat if something happened to it."
3,It wasn't all Custer's fault.,"While George Custer and five undermaned companys of cavalry were fighting for their lives,another seven companies just three miles away stayed out of the fight. How can Major reno and Capt. Benteen,the commanders of the seven companys,say they couldn't hear the firing or see the great clouds of dust raised? They didn't know where Custer was. This vidio shows that not only did they hear the firing but must have known that a battle was in progress. With orders from Custer folded in Benteen's pocket to ""Come quick,big village,bring pacs P>S> bring pacs.HE DIDN'T!"
4,iPhone 2,"This was the service package for the iPhone Gen 2 I bought. This product was fine, just turned out to be sucky AT&T coverage."
2,It tries to educate,"THe book is terrific but the movie feels like a not well done telenovela, every scene is about a dramatic cry. Feels like a movie for little kids. THe story is in itself a lesson but the movie is not. Good photography but as a movie it looks like a the pieces of a one year telenovela cut in pieces. THere are better Chilean movies, this is not one of them."
3,Not Bad But...,"Cry of the Loons isn't a bad CD, it just doesn't do it for me. The CD starts with the soft ""roar"" of water (waterfall?) and shortly thereafter, the loons start up. If you've never heard loons (and I hadn't), they make haunting cries that would be perfect for Halloween! Being a big sissy, I don't like ""haunting"" anything so the CD didn't do much for me. But the recording quality is pretty good and if you like loons, you'll like this."
2,Not well-written,"Rabbi Heschel may have been a great man, active in the civil rights movement and other just causes. His skill as a young writer and biographer seems lacking in this book though. Very drab and dry, it seems to bounce around way too often. One does not get a good feel for Maimonides and only a limited glance at the era in which he lived. I found little in this book that would encourage me to recommend it to others."
3,Color Misleading,"It's not a pastel yellow with shimmer, it's actually a very faint gold that requires many layers in order to show a distinct color. This product would work best with an opaque or at least a visible base polish, and then overlay this light gold color. I'm disappointed. I thought I had finally found a yellow I didn't have to alter with another polish; I was wrong. I have a one-year-old and so adding on layers to my nails is not an option for me. After about four layers later (which required an entire day's worth of work for me), I finally came to a satisfied tone on my nails, though they're not as bold as the photo shows. Very, very disappointed."
4,Great Tool for Understanding Bilingualism,The book is a great tool for teaching and/or understanding bilingualism in general. The only downside is that it does not have a glossary of terms. You can always make your students do one on their own based on the terms provided in the book.
3,Multiple voices: An Introducation to Bilingualism,"This is good introduction to bilingualism and multilingualism. All of the traditional concepts are covered, though not in depth. Some of the chapters (code-switching and lexcial borrowing) are quite technical for beginners, while others are just right. The book is geared toward understanding bilingualism as practiced in a wide range of groups. For me, there was not enough focus on Spanish-English bilingualism, or indigenous language-English bilingualism, and the chapter on code-switching was not very good. The audience for this book seems to be people who are teaching in international ESL programs or in intercultural education programs. It is not the kind of book I would recommend to K-12 teachers, because there are few examples of bilingualism in schools or in bilingual communities."

3,"""Not a deep read, but plenty of good action""","A rather interesting premise. A brave new world where jets and rockets are rendered useless by a Chinese ""Star Wars"" satelitte. The only hope for mankind lays in the ancient carrier ""Yonaga"" and her crews of old samuri.A very fast paced read. Albano writes some very good action scenes, especially the final confrontation in the Med between ""Yonaga"" and the Libyans. Also interesting to see how a crew born during Japan's militaristic era cope with the present day world, never once relinquishing their samuri code. Character development is okay. The romance between Brent Ross and the Israeli agent seemed forced and rushed. Dialogue could have been better. Still, not bad for a pure, hard action book."
5,Greatest piece of Jewish Music =s Handel's Messiah,"This is a great recording of one of the greatest pieces of religious music, not just for Jews but for Christians alike. Only one recording better: Bernstein's classic recording on vinyl with his New York Symphony and the late great Leonard Warren, sadly not available on CD, (so far as I know). (Pray for Bernstein's CD availability, then demand it, from the powers that be!) [Yes, this recording is a little better than the South African recording, I have all three!]"
2,An okay book,"The book has some very good highlights and covers the entire range of the Dell Axim. It is up to date, covering the latest pocket pc from Dell as well as the older models. However, the book is not a ""how-to"" reference that I thought it was. It will tell you what is available, but not how to use it. The book does not go into detail on using the Dell Axim, but refers to web sites for further information. This is not what I bought the book for. If you are looking for specific information on using the Dell Axim, this is not the place to find it."
4,Good book for collectors of outdated gadgets,"With tablets and smartphones, who uses a PDA anymore? But I have an Axim on my desk, I kind of keep gadgets around past their prime (and/or collect them), and this is a cool ""How to Manual"" for the device."
1,Wrong shirt!!!!,The Doctor J shirt I ordered came as a Wilt Chamberlain shirt. Not happy with this at all and couldn't return it because it came just before Xmas. Made do with what they sent me but won't buy from Amazon again.
3,The Price,I know this is a really good DVD but why is it so expensive? People! This DVD set is $200!!! TOO EXPENSIVE!
4,STRAPPING YOUTH!,"The soundtrack is classical music and not always well edited, that's my only complaint. After listening for about 3 weeks I noticed a change; I felt stronger and happier. It's now a year later but I still ocassionally listen to this title. You can sometimes hear a whispered affirmation or two in your right ear. I recommend this to everyone who wants to rejuvenate themselves, even to world-weary teenagers!"
2,Buy separately and save your money!,"I LOVE this show, but I think it's ridiculous that you have to spend more money to buy the seasons all together than if you buy each one on its own. Save some money and buy each one separately - you still get free shipping. Enjoy!"
5,Love it,The kids are loving this new toy and it is so sturdy. No worries of the fabric ripping apart.
3,A bit disappointed,"I have always enjoyed Stacy's soy chips. I used to buy it in large quantities when it was sold at Costco, however it was discontinued. So i began purchasing the chips from Amazon. Unfortunately I find that the chips just don't taste the same anymore. Don't get me wrong they are still delicious, but the taste is different. They are not as flavored as they used to be. We still buy them but my family and I just don't eat as much."
5,"Delicious, healthy snack","Stacy's Soy Crisps are great. I have been ordering them from another online vendor for awhile, but Amazon had such a great price that I decided to try ordering from them instead. The product arrived on time and tasted fresh (not stale, since I thought the great price might be because they were selling ""old"" product). I highly recommend this product, no matter where you get it from, and I was please with Amazon's service and price."
2,Something went wrong,"The previous case of this product that I bought here before was 5-star excellent. The last shipment had nothing in common with the previous. Many of the ""crisps"" were flat, hard, and crackly, and many had a slight burnt aftertaste. There was much less of a ""cheesy"" flavor than before. I think manufacturing/QC let them down."
4,COOL PARKING GARAGE,"I know that there is not a better parking garage out there but wish the elevator was a little better made and the kids were able to see on the second floor better otherwise very cool, worth every penny"
3,poor bing,"Bing Crosby is undoubtedly one of the greatest entertainers of the 20th century and I am definitely a fan. I had seen most of his better known films from Going My Way to High Society, even Rhythm on the River and Birth of the Blues, but was not prepared for this box! These are not great films, not really interesting films, and not films I want to watch again. You would have to be a true-blue lover of the crooner before feeling justified in buying this set. Sorry Bing."
4,An odd collection of Bing Crosby films,"I purchased this 'collection' to get one film in particular, ""Waikiki Wedding"" after seeing the poster near where the old art-deco cinema used to be in Honolulu. Although Bing did a promotion tour to Hawaii, staying in the old Royal Hawaiian (ask to see the old photos and posters in their gallery) Not filmed in Hawaii but has a few stock scenes of old Waikiki beach. Kinda hokey but still fun. It's notable for the debut of the song ""Blue Hawaii"" which was, amazingly, the *B* side of the Academy Award (Best song) from the same movie, ""Sweet Leilani"". Martha Raye adds her own style of hokey comedy!"
3,Silly Fun,"What are you looking for with Bing? You expect music and a little romance and some fun...and that's what these movies give. They aren't extraordinary, but they are fun and for the price...what the heck."
4,Crosby Screen Legend Collection,"These are enjoyable movies. Betty Hutton plays identical twins in ""Here Come The Waves"". Impressive special effects for the (pre-digital) times. Child star Gloria Jean plays opposite Crosby in ""If I Had My Way"". They duet several catchy songs. She has a great voice, not overshadowed by Crosby as you might expect."
3,For Bing Fans Only,"This set contains five movies starring Bing Crosby in movies from the late 1930s to the mid 1940s. Bing Crosby was one of the most popular singing stars of this period and any musical he stared in could be expected to make money. Paramount, the studio Bing worked for, did not feel the need to spend a great deal of money on these pictures(Universal produced one of these movies). Therefore the production values on these movies are low. They also did not want their writers to get too createive on these movies. because of this, the only reason to watch four of these movies is to hear Bing sing-which he does very well, thank you. However, one of these movies is very good, with an excellant songbook, a good plot, and very good actors to back up Bing. This movie is 'Here Come the Waves'. This one movie makes it worthwile to buy the entire set-if you can get this set at the right price."
5,the general history of New Zealand,"Belich is the leading historian in NZ. he has previously made his name by reappraising the way we view the Maori Land wars.Here he has undertaken to write the only general history of New Zealand. This is supposed to be Volume one, though there is no set date for vloume two to appear.He mixes passion for his subject with a great turn of phrase - for example the way he describes New Zealand as being the product of two sets of boat peoples (Maori and Pakhier) is poingent given the way in Maori mythology Aoteroa is said to be a canoe and a fish and also given how Kiwis refer to new arrivals as ""boaties"".Although somtimes this weighty book gets bogged down with lists of facts and accademic arguments, none the less, its both a great read and the seminal work of Kiwi history."
4,good history of Botswana and Seretse,"Seretse Khwama was the first president of Botswana but he was more than that. He was a chief who gave up his chieftanship to marry the woman he loved, he was a moralist who suffered through exile by England to uphold his principles and he was a pragmatist who lead his country through independance even with apartheid countries all around him.Seretse was more than an amazing leader, he was an amazing person and this book is his story. It teaches you not only about Seretse but about Botswana as well."
4,Nutcracker,"A story told with the fabulous music. The characters are portrayed with more personalities that most, as a young boy prince needs help from a little girl drawn into the adventure."
1,Disappointed,"I was excited to receive my copy in the mail. I have enjoyed using another Notes Alive video, ""My Many Colored Days,"" with my kids at school, but not this one. I was disappointed to see some nude statutes in the background of one of the scenes. Believe me, my kids (elementary age) would see them too. The rest of the video was outstanding. I find it very unfortunate that because of some nude statutes, which could have been omitted, the video is unsuitable for my kids at school. My principal agrees. I would really like to see that scene edited so I could use it!"
4,Epic Duran Duran spin-off project,"This immaculately produced and performed album primarily serves as a showcase for keyboard player Nick Rhodes' talents as a soundsmith. Arcadia, consisting of Rhodes, Simon Le Bon and drummer Roger Taylor, assisted by a host of other musicians including Grace Jones, Sting, David Gilmour, and Herbie Hancock, let Nick realise all his ideas, and Simon wrote some of his best and most touching lyrics for this album. As a whole, it is very atmospheric, and songs like 'El Diablo', 'Missing' and 'Lady Ice' are downright ethereal. The two best-known tracks, 'Election Day' with its humongous beat and the beautiful 'The Promise' with Sting helping out on backing vocals, are my favourites on an album that showed even the most stuck-up and narrow-minded critics that the members of Duran Duran were (are) not just pretty boys devoid of talent. Even today 'So Red The Rose' stands out as a collection of great songs and as one of the best produced albums ever."
4,"The song ""Election Day"" is a masterpiece!","The bass line may not change much in the song ""Election Day"", but it takes complete talent to write such an awesome song. I still can't believe how good it is after almost 20 years. The rest of the album is 80's good. The dark sound of it is best listened to in cold cloudy weather - it just has a winter feel to it."
5,Fantastic album,"This one is definitely in my personal top 10 of all time. Great fabalous fantastic album, better than any other duran album. Unfortunately there's only 1 Arcadia album. The title and the album cover are a tastefull as the music itself. My advise: buy and njoy."
1,remaster totaty disaster missing track and vinyl take,the recording engineer who mastered the discs is a joke why put this guy to remaster i have the original vinyl and cd of the first edition and is better only the dvd is rescatableim buy this edtion with hight hopes and when im listen the sound is so bad why you remaster with bad architecture emi please remaster again the tape and call tu duran duran to give the okto sound bad for emi very bad for emimissing track i have one rusian edition bootleg and have more track and better quality the second disc is takeng from vinyl
2,Not as great as Duran,"Ok, it has some strong tracks, but this is below the standards.It is very duranish, but still different.Not bad, but weak from such a great band.Save your money, and get the Duran albums instead."
3,Too Long The Album!,"Like every album I download, I wanted to burn this one to CD. Well the first disc fits just fine, but the second disc has too long a running time. Turns out there's no way I can burn them both to CD, since together they wind up being more than 160 minutes. True, I could just make the second disc a data CD, but then I wouldn't be able to play it in my car. Oh well, at least I can play the first disc in my car. As for the music, Election Day sounds as stunning as ever, and just in time for the CA gubernatorial campaigns too. The rest of the songs...meh. But at least you get a bunch of versions of Election Day!"
5,Best Duran Duran Album Ever!,"The past reviewers cover this album in sufficient technical detail, but I have just got to reiterate that this is Duran Duran at their musical best. No album before or since touches as many levels of music as this one does. If I could only keep one album by Duran Duran/Arcadia...this is it!"
5,absolutely perfect. this was the best album of the 80's,The passion and experimentation on this piece of art goes beyond anything that Duran Duran has ever done(and that is saying alot). I thank them for letting us feel it.
4,very good,"Very good product, nice videos and very well sound,a great memorie from this great band.For all duran duran fans!!!!.I thing this product have one problem: the subtitles options for the documentary this band and duran duran have lot of fan around the world and not all know english.So Red the Rose (2 CD/DVD)"
2,Only for the Fans,"Duran Duran are great, whether as a 5-piece or a 3-piece. I bought this CD out of nostagia as I had the original vinyl version way back when CD's didn't exist. Arcadia were a Duran spin-off where Simon,Nick and Roger did this album and Andy and John went on to form The Power Station. The songs on this album do not come near the quality of Duran Duran and are at best B-Sides...The singles at the time did not sell well and the album received luke-warm reviews...Nothing has changed in 20years and the album still feels like a non-event...Stick to the Duran albums !!!"
1,about as avant garde as christina milian,i would plead with all lovers of good music to stay far away from this awful cd featuring arcadia a terrible band which featured one of the cheesiest songwriters and vocalists known to mankind ever simon le bon.the only saving grace on this album is the presence of david gilmour the guitarist of the greatest band pink floyd playing here only as a guest musician on three tracks.avoid this disaster which bombed badly at all costs.get pulse from pink floyd instead to hear gilmour at his best.half a star.
4,Arcadia: So red the rose,"I am glad to have purchased this CD/DVD. The music is remastered, love EL DIABLO and many others. Not too keen on the 12-inch music as their are too many!? Didn't know a documentary was out and enjoyed watching the making of their videos, not the making of an album. It's kind of boring, but worth the collectors for duran fans!"
5,Simply awesome...,"The special edition release astounds with technically perfect 80's pop sound; having said that, it's no campy 80's pop-trash, it's mature, strong and truly a work of art from that era. After the astounding and jubilant Seven & The Ragged Tiger, Duran Duran grew up, and have never looked back."
4,"""One from the heart...""","It's been two decades since this album was first released and it still thrills me! ""The Flame"" has such a cool, fat bassline and playful lyric. ""Election Day"" will always be a classic. ""Missing"" is hauntingly beautiful.Power Station was a wonderful Duran Duran side project, but Arcadia far surpassed them."
3,Pretty good album.,"So Red the Rose is a pretty good album from Arcadia. Before I had got this disc a handful of years ago, ""Election Day"" was the only song that I had ever heard. Every tune on the album is listenable and satisfying. There's a total of nine tracks--one of them (""Rose Arcana"") is an instrumental. The album's musicianship, songwriting, and production are good. The musical direction of So Red the Rose is pop rock with a slight progressive edge. Simon Le Bon does a nice job with the vocals, and Nick Rhodes' keyboard playing is interesting, atmospheric, and cool. I've always enjoyed and admired Nick Rhodes' keyboard skills--they are the aspect of the album that I like the best. My favorite song from this disc is ""Goodbye Is Forever."" So Red the Rose is interesting and worth a listen."
3,Mattress Does Not Look Like Picture,"Perhaps I was very naive but I was disappointed when the mattress I received was a plain (and IMHO ugly) green. However, it is quite thick and comfortable for the price. For only $30 more I bought a nice futon cover I can remove and wash as needed. Just be prepared, the picture is lovely. The mattress is green."
1,Disappointed with the Disco,"I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my 10 year old son. As a previous reviewer noted, it is a bit tricky to turn on the lights. But once I learned the process, I discovered that lights on ball # 1 did not work at all. Furthermore, the disco lights on balls #2 and #3 did not work. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this toy since it does not fulfill its claims."
3,super fun----get plain ones instead,"These are a very fun toy, especially for a child that likes to yo-yo. They are more difficult than they look. My son is twelve and he is having a ball; but a much younger child may not be able to do as many tricks. This style is supposed to light up and flash also. We have two out of three balls that are defective. One doesn't turn on; and one wouldn't turn off until the battery died. I wish that I had gotten the regular ones with out the flashing lights."
3,Great toy! Kind of cheaply made.,"These astrojax are a lot of fun. They are somewhat challenging to get going, but they are mesmerizing once they work.Two problems with them:1) They are made of a hard plastic that will break eventually. I don't know why they didn't use a softer material with more bounce.2) The electronics are janky. It is hard to turn the lights on and off. WAY harder than it should be.I took away one star for each problem."
4,Not so Rave-riffic,"These are a really cool toy for ACTIVE adults, hence the company's name, although it's perceived to be a good rave toy because of the lights and patterns, for the person doing them it requires a bit of effort, so it's really only good for people watching during rave time. Otherwise, a very neat toy! They're really fun to play with once you get the hang of them, tires you out after a while."
1,"good for a while, but started to rust","This pot was good for a year or so, but we started to notice rust. Worthless now."
4,"Solid and simple surge outlet, supports additional load.","I've installed this outlet as a primary outlet for a 60"" plasma TV in my office. Unlike some of the competitor products out there, leviton's has additonal load terminals to support a load (additional outlets). I've put two standard outlets in my cabinet below as a load on this surge.This unit is sacrificial, and not able to be reset after a surge. There's a green LED on the front that indicates that the surge electronics are functioning. Once this unit is tripped by a surge, it will alarm. The alarm is silenced by a plastic screw on the faceplate that is covered by a sticker. After being tripped the green LED will be off and the outlet will continue to function as a non-surge outlet until replaced.Leviton.. can we have more colors than blue?"
4,Perfect for adding outlet behind your flatscreen.,"Full kit: switch plate, surge protected outlet, single gang box. This is a metal box, so you'll need 3/8"" connector for knockout on back or side of box. Primary reason I give this four stars: Assuming drywall already up, you'll have to drill holes in side of box to screw to stud and flush mount with drywall. Still a good value."
2,Not the best,"I learned French in high school for five years, so I am basically familiar with the language, but I am not comfortable speaking it. I bought this set (with the CDs) to try and brush up on my speaking skills. I was not impressed. The dialogs don't always focus on practical situation--these was one that was a call-in talk show! They also seemed a bit short. I use Audacity to cut out the English from the exercises in language books, and when I was done there wasn't a lot left that was useful.The Living Languages Ultimate series is not much more expensive, and focuses more on useful dialogs. I would recommend buying that instead."
5,Life Before Dilbert,"As told from the point of view of one technical manager and the cast of characters he had both the pleasure and misfortune of working with, '...Peckerhead' tries to lay out the taxonomy for all things pathological that serve to stymie the routine hammering out of what would otherwise be only a stupifyingly complicated technical task.Ample proof that there was a well developed sense of Dilbert long before 'cubicle' entered the popular lexicon, the author provides a sense of humor, humanity, and insanity.Unlike works such as Kidder's ""Soul of a New Machine"", this is not a narrative retelling of what happened. Rather, it's more a compilation, a ""Best of Meeting Hell"", of snips and snatches of everyday occurrences and how they were felt by managers and engineers.One possibly small disappointment is that names, those of people and companies alike have been changed to protect both the innocent and the guilty.A fine read, for hopeful and cynic alike."
2,Not what I expected.,Advertised as three volumes...but turned out to be only one book of three. I thought this was a little misleading.
5,Outstanding,"Desyn has the ability to weave complex rythems, melodies, and harmonies, which can take you out of the mundane into a world filled with lush and vibrant color. Just picked this one up the other day and haven't put it down since. The CD starts off strong and ends strong---not a bad song on here. It gets better with each listen, and thats saying a lot seeing as how I like the sound almost immediately. Desyn is definitely one to watch, and his debut on Bedrock is nothing less than phenomenal"
1,Had to return it,"Bought as a gift. Upon opening box immediately noticed this was previously used unit; internal packaging material broken and water spots in the tank. I decided to try it anyway, hoping it had been returned for something other than performance. Nope -- water leaked from below boiler unit quite badly. Really awful for the manufacturer to sell a reconditioned unit as new, worse one that does not work! The item is quite heavy returning it was a real chore. I urge the prospective buyer to be be wary of this manufacturer again. I won't risk buying from tjem again."
1,The noisiest toy,"This is the loudest noise making toy we've ever had the displeasure of owning. In fact the train noises are so loud that they make our 15 month old son cry every time he musters up the courage to press on the conductor. He is genuinely frightened by the sounds the train makes. Sadly, the train looks to be so durable that it may never die."
3,Train doesn't work on Tracks,"I guess this is more of a question than a review. Mine works fine when you put it on the floor, but doesn't move at all when I put it on the track. I've replaced the batteries and everything. Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe it's just defected! Other than that major problem, my 13month old son loves it."
1,An Expensive Way to Buy Lined Paper in Bound Form!,"Each page in this journal is in the same format. It has a one sentence epigram from Life Strategies at the top. You then get blue lines across the rest of the page, where you can fill in your ideas on this topic.Compared to either Life Strategies or The Life Strategies Workbook, this journal is not very helpful at all.If you have read Life Strategies, you can simply write down your ideas about the key elements in that book on your own paper.If you want to do exercises, The Life Strategies Workbook is superb and I highly recommend it.Skip this journal!Do you learn best by thinking, writing, talking, doing, or some combination of the above? Whatever the best method is, use that method to apply Life Strategies to improving your life."
1,choose a better self help book,"I was dissappointed in this journal, because it seemed like more of a workbook. I was expecting more of a self help book, not a book which I had to write my own opinions. I bought this book to hear the opinions of another person, that is not what I recieved. I do not think that is helpful, but if you like to do exercises, go ahead and try it."
2,Limited educational value AND limited fun,"I strongly recommend against this train. The educational value is very limited -- it only teaches 3 songs and the sound made by a handful of letters. In addition, our version sometimes gets the letters wrong! My 18 month old likes pushing the buttons to start and stop the train and inserting the letter blocks, but there is not much more you can do to play with the train. If he takes it off the track to run it elsewhere or play with it, the VERY ANNOYING voice repeats ""I'm off the track!"" over and over again. Bottom line -- doesn't teach much, doesn't encourage (or really permit) creative play, is expensive and is annoying to adults!"
4,PROBLEMS WITH TRAIN,I FOUND THAT THE BLOCKS WHEN INSTALLED WOULD NOT READ THE CORRECT LETTER. THIS IS NOT GOOD WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO EDUCATE YOUR TWO YEAR OLD.
5,my sons favorite toy!!,"i got this train set for my son a few months ago who is 18 months old and he loves it!! he gets soo excited seeing it go. Hes really into trains right now, like thomas & friends so i thought it would be a great investment. He cant put the toy down he stays busy for hours and its very educational it teaches you how to sound out letters and what each letter stands for. love it!!"
2,Very Frustrated!!!,"My 2 yr old received this for a gift and at first I LOVED it...I thought it was the cutest toy.But, after putting it together... it became the most frustrating toy we have. The train constantly de-rails off the track.. I've tried everything to fix the plastic tracks, but the train can't remain on the tracks for long. Plus, mine also has an annoying ""short"" inside, so when it hits certain bumps, it turns off.I'm going to put the toy away b/c it's not any fun for my kids...it has to be constantly reset and placed back on the track and since they can't do it, I have to.It's a shame, b/c it is was more durably built, it would be the Best toy and I would have rated it a 5."
3,"My kids love it, but I don't","My kids love this train (ages 2 & 4), however there is only one train so there is constant fighting over who gets to control the train. They do not use the blocks, so even though the educational aspect is a great idea, all my boys care about is watching the train go around and around. If you do not already have multiple train sets and only one child who loves trains, then this may be a good one to get. Something else to be aware of is that this is pretty big and not a real quick set up. So its a little bit of a hassle to use if you do not plan on keeping it out somewhere."
4,Fun for the whole family,"I bought this toy for my almost 2 year old son. I know right now he doesn't comprehend the phonics part of this toy, but he sure loves the train. Everytime he pushes the button and the train goes around the track, he looks up at us with an exciting grin! It was a hit for Christmas, and he plays with it for hours. He is slowly learning to put the blocks in the train. The only down side I see in this toy is the ""Go"" button. This Button also stops the train. This can be confusing for a parent much less a child. I would love to have seen 2 seperate buttons, or to have the 1 button only do one function. All in all....great toy."
5,An Abundance of Ideas for Individual and Group Retreats,"This is absolutely one of the most well-read, underlined, highlighted and corners-turned-down books on my bookshelf! As a SoulCollage facilitator and leader of many weekend retreats on the topics of wholeness, authenticity, spirituality and creative expression, there really aren't any other books out there on the topic of creating a retreat that aren't strictly Christian-oriented. Lucky for all of us that this is such an excellent resource!I love this book because it helps me on two levels- creating my own oasis of solitude when I retreat by myself, and creating retreats for other women who are seeking Spirit and inner connection.--- Anne Marie Bennett, SoulCollage Facilitator and Facilitator Trainer, www.KaleidoSoul.com... Spinning the fragments of your world into wholeness and beauty through SoulCollage"
5,Real not Manufactured,"Timeless and Beautiful - It was a time when ""Image and Talent"" was created on stage in front of an audience...Not like today were ""POP"" it is created in the studio with countless overdubbing then marketed by mass media hype and awful lip sinking...YUK!But! There is still great music being made everyday.We just have to be aware of all the Roots, Grassroots, or what ever you want to call it, going on around the world...""Thank Humankind for the Internet! Keep on Singin' & Pickin'."""
3,The original Michael Row Your Boat Ashore and some competent but second string folk,"Their big hit was ""Michael, Row Your Boat Ashore,"" a 1960 original thatperformed the rare trick of sounding extremely old and traditional. Thattrack, and 23 more, are present here. There are a few interesting stones tounturn, including an early pop version of ""Big Rock Candy Mountain"" and acover of ""The First Time (Ever I Saw Your Face)"" that predated RobertaFlack's hit by nearly a decade. But overall, this is rather tame, unexcitingfolk ensemble stuff, albeit reasonably well sung and arranged. They're thebiggest musical thing to ever come out of Wesleyan University, and theMonkees ripped off their logo, but you probably don't need to know more thanthat, unless you've already dug pretty deep into the early '60's folk scene."
2,Bereits obsolet geworden.. aus amerikanischer Sicht vielleicht lesenswert,"Leider ist das Buch bereits veraltet.Finde interessant, dass sich die Leute für so was interessieren.Manche amerikanische Leser sollten sich damit abfinden, dass der zweite Weltkrieg zu Ende ist. Haider wird in Österreich auch nicht ernst genommen und seine Partei ist bereits in 2 Parteien zerfallen.Man kann ihn nur als Politkasperl akzeptieren.Seit langem ist Österreich kein kriegsführendes Land mehr, im Gegensatz zu den USA. In Wien sind wir sozialistisch regiert und stolz drauf. Freundschaft !!!"
3,laser keyboard,"excellent product, save for the fact that it's best used in the dark and not on shiny desk surfaces otherwise the light is constantly interfering. it's bluetooth connection was best for me to link it to my ipaq 2215 (ppc), I was able to type up multiple documents/ aim chat in the right conditions."
4,Should be a must for blues players,"First off this is not really for a beginner player. You need to also be pretty familar with the fretboard for one reason. If you want to learn more about playing ""orginal blues"" for electric this is probably one of the better DVDs around. VEry quality production and Jim is a quality instructor. Goingn Down, St Elmos Blues, Hideaway, and Sugar Cane Blues are the tunes he covers in this dvd. He discusses a few blues scales, blues rythmns as well as some of the classic licks in detail. All these are taught based on their orginal arrangements for the most part. Sugar Cane Blues is Jim's own tune though. If you have been playing electric some already and want to see & hear how to play in the style of Freddie King this may help you out. I woul dnot get this if you are just starting out though on electric in general. Hideaway is a lot harder to do than it looks! Also he demonstrates everything pretty good and then Jim and his backing band let's you play along too."
1,Tragic,"Instructional guitar DVDs are hard to make, and this one is a lesson in how not to make one. The instructor is awkward and hesitant (it crossed my mind that he was stoned). He throws out bits of useless information (""Stevie Ray Vaughn plays this a lot now, but it's really an old lick""). He plays a lick quickly several times and expects you to magically pick it up. I kept finding myself staring at the TV, thinking his fingers were one string lower than they actually were. An occassional fretboard diagram would be very helpful. There is a booklet of tablature, but it doesn't always seem to match what he's playing. I would expect a DVD with this name to have a few dozen simple, popular blues licks -- alas, no such luck. This DVD goes through a few uninspired blues songs and a few cursory licks, and wraps up.Pass on this one."
4,A great escape,"This book is filled with nonstop action. As one story seems to be resolved, Britt finds herself sliding into another one. And it's handled credibly; it DOES seem like all part of a day's work for our very believable heroine. This is the second book I've read from the series, and I highly recommend it."
4,Bear is very cute,"This is a good buy at $7.42 with super saver shipping (if your purchase totals $25 or more). It cost me a couple dollars more a few weeks ago, so this is another item where the price can fluctuate on Amazon. The bear itself is cute, especially for my soon-to-be eight year old granddaughter. The cream color is very pretty, and the bear comes completely wrapped in cellophane in case you have to store it a while before gifting. Moreover, my granddaughter can go online and name a star, giving some more interest and educational content. I particularly like this idea because it's something that her mom or dad can help her with (i.e., more parent-child interaction), not only for naming the star but for learning more about working with the internet in general."
2,Missing ping pong balls!?,This set was supposed to come with eight 3-star 40mm ping pong balls but it did not. There were places for them in the plastic packaging but they were empty. The odd thing was that there is a plastic security cord that keeps the zippers closed so this error must have occurred at the factory. Returned for refund and ordered another one. Fingers crossed.
4,Good Set,"This is a good set. The rubbers are mid-grade and the paddles are reasonably light. These paddles generate a pretty decent amount of spin. Control has always been a weaker side of butterfly paddles, but it isn't too bad. The carrying case is pretty sweet; keeps the paddles dry/dust-free."
2,Good price for so so quality!,"If you are looking for high quality product, this is not it! This is strictly for little kids' entertainment to hit back and forth. The balls will not go very fast even if you hit it hard and it is hard to put any spin on the ball. Basically, the ball just goes flat. But considering the price for the set of 4, it is a good deal. Just be aware of the quality you get for that price!!!"
5,Good quality at excellent price,"These are an upgrade from my previous set of Harvard paddles. These are a dramatic improvement in control, spin, and sound (rather than the muted sound, the Butterfly paddles produce a traditional pong sound that helps identify the speed of the returner's shot. It also provides sonic feedback on the shot that you yourself have hit.) I can generate good speed, create predictable spin, produce touch shots, and direct the depth and angle of the shot. The price was great for 4 paddles."
3,Somebody Screwed up,I'm glad I read the first review of this book before I bought it. For some reason it is advertised a part of the Guardians of Ga'hoole series and it is not. This has nothing to do with the Guardians of Ga'hoole. What is going on?
4,Almost Fantastic,"I had been waiting impatiently for the last installment of the Guardians of Time trilogy. For the most part, I was not disappointed by the book when it was published.It's a suspenseful book, full of plot twists and unexpected turns of events. The narrators for the story are Matt and Rochelle, who are still dealing from the fallout of Rochelle's treachery and later entry into the Guard. We learn a lot about who Matt and Rochelle are, what makes them work, and how they handle mistakes that have been made and the possibility of a grim future.I recommend this book to you with one minor caveat. If you're expecting a firm resolution and a tight ending to the trilogy, you will not get. The book just ENDS. I turned the page because I was sure that that just couldn't be it, but it was. That's the reason why I rate it four, not five, stars."
3,An O.K. Ending,"I really loved the first two books, but was disappointed in this one. I'm not sorry that I finished the series, but wish it had ended differently."
5,Excellent Book for my English Class!,This book was chosen by the instructor and at first I wasn't sure if I was going to really be able to get into it...until I went to class! Now that it is all highlighted and underlined I really like the book and plan to use it again when I have to write papers for future classes.
3,Good Book,"I had a unique and bizarre professor that loved this book.She said ""keep this book, you need to think critically andthis book has the tools to help you do that."" That teacher wasaround eighty-five and dosen't use computers. This review isdedicated to her and this book she loves so much."
4,"Beautiful, minimalist music to write to","Although Helios is not an act I'd call revolutionary, I will go on a limb to say it's some of the best ambient music available to chill out to. It's not music to chat over or to have at a lounge bar, it's music to be combined with something else in your life. It could be yoga, writing, meditating or just relaxing. Eingya is a wonderful album with quality atmospheric beats from track one to the last one. My favorite on the entire album would have to be Dragonfly Across An Ancient Sky. The strings, beats and all other elements gel seamlessly to create a wonderful song that sounds like the soundtrack to a post-apocalyptic world that is actually beautiful. If you want beautiful music to chill to, this is an excellent option."
5,Worth every penny!,"This thing works, I mean really works, just like the pepper mill, it took a drum stick maker to perfect salt and pepper mills!"
5,A really first class product,"As an engineer, I have always wondered why no-one made a decent pepper grinder that kept its setting. Well, when I finally decided to see if anyone had, I found this and it is fantastic. It works great, rock solid at keeping its setting, even grind, does a better than I imagined when coarse grinding. Downside is that I enjoy fresh ground pepper even more than before and now am becoming a pepper varietal snob.Heartily recommended."
2,Mismatched,"Wrong color;the two ""Cinnabar color"" salt and pepper mills that I ordered didn't match each other at all! One was cherry red and the other was Cinnabar...wrong color match."
5,the BEST,Well made. Works GREAT. Received very quickly. Worth the money (so far). Only complaint is the finish (color) of the salt and pepper mills were a little off (though helps at quick glance to ensure you grab the right one while cooking ;-).
4,Interesting Peek into a Dark World,"The book reads like a really long research paper, which will turn off some people. It's an intense read with case details and insights into dark minds. The transitions between chapters are nicely handled so that it doesn't seem like a collection of loosely connected notes.It's not really a ""fun"" book, but it is informative and highly interesting. Those looking for thrills should look elsewhere, but those looking for honest, intellectual insight into how the predators think have found what they're looking for."
2,too simple,"You can learn more in a one hour Discovery Channel special than you will in this book. The writing style is simplistic and tediously ""Dragnet cute"" which doesn't help. What the book needs is a real writer and someone to help organize the material better. Oh, yes, and an editor to cut out the many self-congratulatory asides that further weaken the project."
1,Could barely get through it.,"The cases are extremely interesting, however the style of writing is annoying to the point of distraction. There is a way of writing of one's accomplishments without sounding like a self-aggrandizing 16 year old. McCrary, Ressler (and the writers helping them) apparently are not aware of this. I think John Douglas's book, Mindhunter, got it right."
3,A Darker Side of Life,"This type of book is the not a genre that I would normally read. The book was given to me at Christmas by my brother in law. I'm not sure what that says about his interpretation of me.To true crime buffs, this is probably a great book. However, to the more geneal reader such as myself, I often found the writing style tedious and self-congratulatory. The cases are often fascinating, it is the style that grates.In spite of the style, there are some highlights to the book. The Sam Shepard where he murdered his wife and the events of Waco Texas are bizarre to the extreme. The Buddhist temple massacre is a display of humanity at its worst. There is truly some real evil locked away in some members of the population. McCrary is simply outlining the facts that the rest of us may choose to ignore.Finally, if nothing else, this book proves that although true crime literature has its followers, I am not one of them."
3,More Reglious than stand-up,"This one is not at all what you expect. It is a sermon with humor in it. It is good and has a good message, but it isn't his typical routine. I do recommend it."
2,incorrect size received; leather is cheap-looking,"I received a 8 oz flask instead of the advertised 6 oz flask.The leather is cheap-looking.The regular, ground shipping cost was high, so I felt it would cost almost the same amount to ship it back as the product itself, so I kept it.However I wanted a smaller flask than received.I e-mailed the seller directly about these problems, but never heard back from them."
5,An amazing historical novel!,"I read this book in 2 days and couldn't put it down last night until I finished it at 2am. The author gave great details on the war and the characters that you feel like you're part of the story. I also like how the character, Caroline Fletcher, stood up for what she believed and still fought to save her family, even though they didn't agreed what she believed in. I also liked how the author compared the civil war to Bible times. It' never occurred to me how similar the war is to the Egyptian times. Overall, this is a great book that can't be put down without finishing it. I'm looking forward to reading more of Lynn Austin's books."
5,GREAT BOOK!!,This book was so good! I highly recommend anyone reading it!! I have passed it on to five people so far and they have all thoroughly enjoyed it. You know it's a good book when the pages are getting worn!
5,LOVED IT,"This book was so good! It's been a while since I last read it, but It is worth buying. To the author: As a Christian teenage girl, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing a wonderful romance for me to read."
3,good,Took a few chapters to get into but still a good book about the civil war and Christianity. Good lead into the 2nd book.
5,wonderful a great read,"ok i dont know about all the technical aspects of the war and slavery, but i did happen to really enjoy this book...seemed to be well thought out story line was great. i couldnt put this down. it is long but keeps you interested."
4,A Great Historical Novel!,"""Candle In The Darkness"" is a great novel about a young woman who fought for her beliefs that were born inside her by her unconditional love for all people. Her courage and sacrifice to guard her strong beliefs and faith in God gave her all the strength that she needed to survive civil war and go against her family members who fought on the other side. Her unselfishness and a beautiful heart shone through the whole story.I just would change the ending a bit. I wish that the writer would describe more feelings of love that were buried inside the hero and heroine, to pour out more at the end of the book. It did not even end with the kiss. I just wish that the ending would be more empowering and believable!"
5,I never read a book twice...but will read this one again!,"I really enjoy reading historical fiction...but this book tops them all. The characters were well rounded, plot fascinating, details exquisite...I am thoroughly impressed. The characters seemed so real. The author used a dialect that the slaves and servants spoke, which was interesting and I enjoyed that aspect of the book.To sum up the book, it was about a woman's courage to stand for what she believed in at all costs. This book was a faith-builder for me to read and enjoyable from the first sentence."
5,Superb book!,"Story of a timid Southern girl living in Richmond, Virginia, during the Civil War era. Her family owns slaves, as do her friends. However, she thinks of them as family, not property, as some do. A short stay with relatives in the North confirms her abolitionist views. She returns to the South and finds herself torn between her home and family (including her slaves) and a beloved suitor who doesn't share her beliefs. When the war starts, her feelings of anxiety increase as she tries to support her men who have gone to fight and still hold to her belief that the ""cause"" of the North is more right than that of the South. I loved this book, as I have most of Lynn Austin's book."
5,I learned a lot about my self and those around me...,I really enjoy Christian fiction books and I always have a hard time choosing the right one. For some reason this book really stood out at the book store and I bought it without realizing what the book was fully about. It is such a strong book about going after what you truly believe in and standing up for what is right! After I finished it I wanted to read more and more about Caroline and I also found myself researching more about the Civil War. It is a hard book to put down! One of my good friends borrowed it & fell in love with it immediately! :0)
5,courage under fire,This book is one of the best books I have ever read.The story of Caroline Fletcher will grab ahold of you and not let go even after the book is finished.The history that is present in this book is woven in with romance and intrigue.You will be amazed at how historically correct this book is and will feel as if you are living right there through it all.Eli the stableslave will strenghthen your faith with his many Biblical sayings.You will struggle with Caroline through the many tough decisions she must make and will not come to the end of the book without at least a little sympathy for all those involved in both sides of the conflict.This is a MUST- READ and I strongly recommend it!!
3,Where's an editor when you need one?,"Although I found this entertaining, it was sorely in need of an editor with some knowledge of history and the language used in the 1860's. Words like ""okay"" and ""pervert"" were obvious choices, but when the main character asks an interloper for a ""search warrant"", I couldn't help but laugh. Really??? If you are going to write historical fiction, pick an editor over 20, for heaven's sake!"
2,"I finished it, but nearly didnt..","I love historical fiction. Its my favorite kind of book in fact. The problem with this book is that I feel like I have read it before. It was like it was trying to be gone with the wind without any steamy love action. In fact it was down right boring. The action if you could call it that, was filled with cliches and wasnt really all that exciting."
2,Very Unrealistic!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Although I finished this book in one day, Caroline's journey seemed nearly impossible to believe and seemed completly unrealistic! I am an avid reader of historical fiction especially of the civil rights/slavery genre and this book missed the mark! I did enjoy the love story bet caroline and charles but the way the story line continued to unfold left me VERY disappointed. Although this book is a trilogy I will not be buying the other two."
1,Annoying,I found the writing tedious and juvenile. I felt is was a poorly researched book claiming to be historical fiction. I can not recommend this book.
4,Candle in the darkness,I have fallen in love with this book from reading the first couple of chapters . I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves the historical fiction genre or just loves to read in general
5,Candle in the Darkness,"Very good read. It speaks of Faith, Love and the human experience during the civil war. I loved it. Look forward to reading more of Lynn Austin's books."
5,Amazing Story,"I recently starting reading books on the Kindle for PC and this is one of the first books I purchased. Such a heartwarming story and not boring as one of the readers said. It is clean and not offensive as so many novels are. As Christians we need to guard our minds and hearts and I never once had to worry that I would read something trashy. Yes, it's true that some of the vocabulary used did not always fit that time period but the story was still wonderful and well written with historical facts. Eli, the slave/preacher, and a man of God with deep faith despite the oppression of slavery, always had words of wisdom based on the truth of God's Word. I was so inspired. It's not easy for most of us to understand what slaves went through but this book gave me some new insight into the life of a slave. I look forward to reading more books by Lynn Austin."
5,Awesome Book!!,"I loved this book. This book shows the struggle of a woman raised in the south during the civil war, but who tries to follow God to help end slavery. I couln't put the book down. Can not wait to read the other two books in the series."
1,fraudulent 2007 edition?,"I have the previous edition, published 2003. This supposedly new edition (May 2007) is NO DIFFERENT than the older one. Moreover, when I purchased this ""new"" copy from Amazon, I was sent an obviously used copy.I've written to the publisher expressing my concerns, and will post their message when they respond."
5,Love Kim Lewis Books!!!,Her books are amazing!! My kids and I could read them over and over again. The pictures are awesome too. Great Books!!
2,Not Waterproof,"I tried to use this to wrap up a leak in my irrigation system and despite that fact that it was extremely sticky and water tight the first few days, it didn't last."
2,Fuel pressure Guage,"Gauge was and still is 1.5 lbs off (low), checking with manual pressure pump, and two other gauges. But allowing for that diffence, it will be okay. At five psi, it reads 3.5 psi, and reads 1.5 psi low all across the scale. For the low price paid for it, along with the cost of return shipping, returning it would be a waste. I will be using it only ocassionally, to check fuel pressure temporarily, so it isn't like I will have it working all the time."
1,"Always Read High, Failed After 4 Years","Installed this gauge on inlet line to a Quadrajet with mechanical fuel pump rated at 6 psi. Gauge read 7 to 7.5 psi from day one, and has been reading 8 to 9 psi recently. Finally pegged on 15 psi. Removed the gauge and it still read 8.5 psi at atmospheric. Installed a new industrial gauge and pressure reads 5.5 psi. Obviously bad from the start."
1,Not working out of the box,"I purchased this gauge here on Amazon thinking that I did not need to spend twice as much for a liquid filled for what I needed and all was well, the product arrived in good shape as always with Amazon purchases and then life happened. I went out of town for work and vacation and finally got a chance to install it and low and behold it did not work. Reads zero at all times. I was lucky enough to find this out on the deadline for returning however it is the deadline for the items to arrive back at Amazon so I am out of luck and out $20.Don't waste your money or if you do make sure you install it right away so if it is defective you can get a replacement."
1,Waste of money,This item does not work. It does not read accurately and the reading changes if you touch the housing. Very poor quality.
5,its awsome,Had it for a month caught over 30 largemouth Bass its a very good lure I highly recommend you buy this
5,a classic that does what it has always done -- catch bass,"This jitterbug is just like every other jitterbug I've ever had; made well, and a fish-catcher. Put one of these on at daybreak or even better at dusk, and get ready to pull them in. I've had the best success over the years with the frog pattern and especially the solid black."
1,1 lure,This ad is very misleading I have written the seller and amazon so hopefully they will correct the information that will lead you to believe that this is a lure kit of some unknown quantity when in fact it is only one jitterbug and it's the small one at that. The shipping isn't worth it.
1,way too advanced,"Bob Brozman is probably the fastest,best stringed instrument player that ever was.Unfortunately,he is way more of a Jaw-Dropping Show-Off than Teacher.This could only be helpful to a Lifetime Virtuoso with at least 20 years full time experience."
2,"Beware, This Is Not For Beginners!","I like Bob Brozman and I have his ""Learn to Play Bottleneck Blues Guitar"" set but this one is really for advance players. Instead of GCEA, which is the tuning I'm starting to learn, the uke is tuned differently.My bad."
1,Good player / poor teacher,I agree with the other one star review. He pretty much just shows off his talent. He doesn't really teach much of anything. As a beginner you will learn just as much by lighting $25 on fire.
1,"Bob Brosnan's ""Ukulele Tunes and Techniques"" is a Waste of Time and Money","Bob Brosnan's Ukulele Tunes and TechniquesI agree with several of the other reviews that this one showcases Brosnan's virtuosity, but doesn't TEACH anything. The Ledward Kaapana segment is much more instructive than Brosnan's, and Ledward uses standard tuning. I was extremely disappointed in Ukulele Tunes and Techniques. Don Johnson"
3,Outhouses by Linda Spivey - Fabric Shower Curtain,"Not my taste. too busy albeit an interesting piece. My bathroom is too small for something so bold. My taste is not as casual as this curtain is although i am sure it would be nice in more darker, rustic home."
3,good but whole size smaller,"order processed fast, shiped on time,but the shoe felt one whole size smaller."
4,Great recreational skates!,"I bought these for my daughter as beginner skates. I'm so glad I read others' reviews and bought one size up and they fit her perfectly! Not only they are functional and they look so pretty. You will get your money worth in just a few uses from not having to rent the skates (they usually have dirty laces and wet). Her skating coach said they are about the same quality as the rental ones. Now she's worn her pair a few times, they are even more comfortable."
4,American Athletic 512 Figure Skates,"These skates are definitely worth the money.Although, the purchase agreement indicated that I could not return the item once the blades are sharpened. The blades came sharpened. Which could have been a problem if they didn't fit."
5,Nice skates for the beginners,It is a good skates for the growing feet. The price is good and my daughter really likes it.
4,Easy to use,Great product at a great price. came in earlier than predicted and we all got so happy that they wanted to use it immediately/
2,"Skilled, yes, but","not as good as ""Ink Complete"" - they are trying too hard musically and lacking groove. The 80s-style vocals are horrendous and the lyrics and little ""comical"" vocal clips are really lame."
1,High maintenance/Pathetic design/Leaks all over,"This unit will cool your place by 10 degrees within a reasonable amount of time (e.g. 30 minutes) but you will also need to empty the drain pan (for water) every hour or two/if that long/or else your carpets will be soaking wet from the drain pan that overflows. Even when you DO empty it on time, the design of the pan makes it very easy to spill water all over the place and DON'T forget the cheasy hose! Once you pull the drain pan away from the air conditioner, it continues to leak water all over the floor through that cheasy hose."
4,Has Held up Well After 77 Years,"Having recently read and enjoyed ""Every man Dies Alone,"" I decided to give this book a turn and wasn't disappointed. As advertised, this novel give a true to life feel for everyday life in pre-World War II Berlin--with all kinds of charming and not-so charming characters. Very touching at times; it has its own low key sense of suspense that keeps the interest level high. My only complaint would be the brief descriptors which precede each chapter. They kind of give things away before you get a chance to read about them."
4,I love Hans Fallada,"I would have given this 5 stars except that Fallada's other books are so stirring that this one became ""just"" a little gem of a book. If I hadn't read ""Every Man Dies Alone"" first, I may not have appreciated the historical importance of this era -- the economic depression in pre-WWII Germany. I am on now to ""The Drinker"" and ""Wolf Among Wolves"". It's been awhile since an author has captivated me like he has. Despite this being an historical novel, the subject is timely, and his characters are memorable."
4,Good but not my favorite Fallada,"This was my 5th Fallada book and I enjoyed it. But, I preferred Wolf Among Wolves and Every Man Dies Alone. Little Man has much of the great writing style that one expects from Fallada but I thought it was a bit short on story and character development."
2,"Excellent book for a beginner, if only.....","This is an excellent book (5 stars) for PeopleSoft beginners, if only they can finish this book. This book has tons of errors including typos (in contents and code examples), and missing instructions (fatal). I am about 30 pages from the finish and can't continue because of the wrong instruction included in the book.It's a shame, I rather enjoyed the book and it could be one of the best PeopleSoft books in the market."
2,"In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king","This book has many, many deficiencies. In many ways, it is simply dreadful. Grammar is dubious, spelling errors abound, and the author's mastery of the subject matter is often rather questionable. Despite all of these shortcomings, though, it's still the only book available on the topic. As an independent contractor, I try to avoid costly vendor training classes whenever possible, opting instead for whatever third-party publications are available. This book makes for an inexpensive -- albeit deeply flawed -- alternative to spending a week in a Peoplesoft training class."
4,Humorous and Christian!,I bought this and one other Ken Davis video to show to my high school sunday school class. (That way they get a break from me!) I like his humor and the way he relates scriptural events to our lives. Good for high school age through adult. I recommend it.
4,Puck steals the show!,"This is not the type of movie I would normally watch - but it is a must-see! The dance numbers are awesome, and the real kick is watching the performance of Puck, which I only realized later was Mickey Rooney - he doesn't look 12, and I found myself wondering ""how did they get him to act like that?"".The movie seems long at times, particulary in the party at the very end. But I wouldn't mind watching it again with someone -"
5,"WARNER'S ""PRESTIGE"" FOLLY - ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL !","A beautiful print with excellent extras. One could certainly quibble about whether or not it's ""Shakespeare"" - But who cares, it's fantastically conceived and BEAUTIFULLY photographed. The cast is eclectic, to say the least - But in nutty sort of way, inspired (Rooney). The Korngold score is a treasure from beginning to end (adapted with great skill from several of Menddelssohn's works - A not totally successful reconstruction of the score can be had on CD {CPO}, but there ARE pleasures to found in it).It's amazing that Warner Bros. could be ""tricked"" into spending so lavishly on a work so out of their ""MO"" - but they were, and we're the benefactors 73 years later! It's to be enjoyed again & again."
3,Good for the time in which it was made.,A Midsummer Night's DreamI laughed at this very funny movie but doubt I will ever watch it again. While I love many of the stars in it it was just a little bit crazy for me.If you like old movies and love to see the advances they made for this year this really does show what you want.
2,A historical curio,"This is an interesting piece of 30's pop art, but that's about all. It has nothing to do with the play or with its spirit, or with making its corresponding image in a new medium. It's a star vehicle for the ""names"" in the cast, some of whom get by with some dignity, others of whom - Mickey Rooney in particular - are just embarrassing. It does have some fairly spectacular imagery for the time and technology - fun to watch, on a certain level, but only as a quaint cinema knick-knack of its day. I really can't imagine presenting this hopelessly dated piece of fluff to secondary school students (as one reviewer claims to do), and trying to trick them into believing that this is the Bard as we know and love him as educated grownups."
2,corntrader19,"I am not familiar with the works of Shakespeare so I can't evaluate it from a literary view. There is supposed to be a scene in which Joe E. Brown plays the flute. I didn't see it. I don't know if it wasn't included or I just missed it. This is a strange movie. I told my husband, ""It's reminds me of the Bugaloos on acid."" I really didn't understand it. It is interesting to me that the actors were not paid to make this movie. It was a project Jack Warner wanted to do to get all of the Warner Brothers actors together to do. They didn't have much say in it."
2,..LOUD & Annoying..!,"...133 minutes of watching good actors tank..!..Shakespeare's art turned to shouting, ranting vaudville and god awful acting..!.I had to open a window while watching this dreck.Leave his work to England..They get it..!"
5,Great,It was it great condition. Amazon was fast at getting the movie to me and I enjoyed seeing this movie for the first time. I will definitely buy from Amazon again.
4,Hit or miss - but a must have,"What can you say? The sets are gorgeous; the acting is either wonderful or awful, depending on the role. Cagney is GREAT as Bottom; Rooney is AWFUL as Puck. The lovers are lousy, except for Olivia de Haviland. Titania is excellent. Oberon will give you nightmares, and I don't mean that as a compliment.But it is what it is: Reinhardt's Midsummer Night's Dream. If you have any interest in Shakespearean movies at all, you simply have to have this one. It looks beautiful. And - for all it's spottiness - when it's good it's very, very good, and Jimmy Cagney is very, very good."
3,Nice Looking,"I like this Panisonic CD player but I wish it got more FM radio stations. It only gets about 2-4 that sounds good. The rest is hard to hear over the staic. I wonder if a external antenna would help? I may have got one with a bad radio tuner? I will check it out further....and write another review if I keep it. OH ..The CD soud is pretty good. John ,West Mich"
1,The worst POS ever,I cant believe a company would sell such an unit. The sound quality is horrendous. I have never heard anything so bad before. I cant tell if its the cheap speakers or the unit. In the pictures it looks like a decent quality unit. Its a cheap imitation of what a good stereo might be. I advise anyone looking to buy a mini stereo to look elsewhere.THERE IS NO BARGAIN HERE. You are paying 80-100 dollars for a 10 dollar unit at best. I am returning my unit I received today.
4,Great for my office,"Great SoundSimple to set upExternal loop AM antenna gets the talk radio I wanted.Professional, classy appearance.Great for my 12x12 office."
4,Not bad for the money,"I bought this CD Desktop Audio System expecting much less because of the price and I was pleasantly surprised with its performance. None of the reviewers mentioned the bass - it has a really good sound to it but I do agree with the reviewer that talked about the mid-range sound - it isn't 100% but, again, for the price, you can not go wrong. I bought a Panasonic CD/Radio some years ago for more money and it didn't sound anywhere near this good - the bass component is key. Also, the volume range is very high - it goes to '50' - this is a good buy!"
4,This one's a winner @ Linens & Things for $49.99,I got a gift card for Linens and Things and just picked up the Panasonic SC-EN7 on clearance sale for $49.99. I had no problems with reception (though I am in NY) and this replaced a clunky old boom box in my kitchen. I fiddled with the settings a bit and thought that it sounded quite good. I took the covers off the speakers and it was even better. I popped in an MP3 cd with 150 songs on it and it took a couple of seconds to read the disc but played fine. After reading the reviews (I wonder what they paid) I got nervous but heck at this price (really FREE for me) you can't beat it. Go to LnT quickly because there were just a few left...you could even resell them on Ebay at these prices....
1,Very Poor FM Reception; Poor Audio Quality,"This Panasonic SC-EN7 was returned after one day's use due to very poor FM reception with the whip antenna and poor audio quality. Mid range audio was muddy, high range and low range were barely acceptable using the equalizer. To top it all off, it looks like a tin can on my shelf, in my humble opinion. Not all microsystems need be like this. I purchased another after I returned this one, and I like it very much. You may see it in my other review if you are interested."
5,I Give It An Enthusiastic Thumbs Up For What It Is...,"I wanted a little supplementary system for my home office---I wasn't expecting much, sort of a glorified boombox. Which is what this is---but I must say, for having spent only $100 bucks, this little system knocked my socks off. I have been playing some acoustic and country music, which pretty much sounds good on anything because it is so well recorded. But today I put it through its paces with some pretty cutting edge rock and I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, it's not a high-end system, but if all you want are some nice tunes for your den or kitchen, this little box is highly recommended. Great on highs and lows, midrange a bit muddley as on most small systems---quite good at higher volumes. A bit less clear at very low volumes, which is true of most small systems."
4,Very good if you have the right needs,"What I mean is that this unit was just about perfect for us because of we wanted in terms of features. I can see where someone desiring really high quality music reproduction would be disappointed, but this is not for that purpose (IMO).Big Pluses for us:Sleep timerFast forwarding within individual mp3 files (not just jumping from beginning to end)Great for a disk with 10 folders and 200 mp3 files spread through them.Minus - Having most of the controls on the remote is risky. Lose it and you pretty much lose the best parts of this unit.FYI - We wanted a unit for listening to CD audio books in MP3 format. Thus the sleep timer and ease of manuvering around large numbers of files in multiple folders are SUPER features. I could not find them anywhere else. Since it is not [primarily] for music, hi fidelity is not as important to us.This is a great unit for home MP3 use. If you just want to play [regular audio] music CDs, look elsewhere."
1,Worst Radio Receiver I've Ever Had!,"Both the AM and FM reception is poor. There is no provision for an external FM antenna (whether that would help, I don't know) and the whip anntenna is terrible. Even fairly strong stations come in with static -- weaker stations don't come in at all. AM is just as bad. If you don't care about the radio and just want a CD player, the sound is passable."
5,Cremasterbation,"Tapioca, vaseline, muscle bound women, dead horses, giants, serial killers, and Harry Houdini. Welcome to the universe of the Cremaster Cycle. Don't try to decode it all. Just take in the visual puzzle. Still, if you wish to take on the cryptic challenge of Matthew Barney, this book will be of use. It's full of lush images, sketches, and photographs. Although this 7lb book is a nice of insight into Barney's oeuvre, you may get mauled carrying it from cafe to cafe. If not, you're sure to get a cramped arm from lugging it around. It's huge and heavy!"
4,Lot of Meat,"Whether you like Barney or not, this book made for the Guggenheim solo exhibition in 2002 have lot of meat. 500 pages covering his Cremaster series (1,2,3), with numerous photograph stills of his films, reference photos, and his works. Approximately, 340 works are shown. The book quality is very good (did not quite match the creativity of Damien Hirst's I want to spend the rest...book), but nevertherless, this book will serve as Barney's important documentation."
1,Defective,"I was so excited to get this book for my son as a gift, luckily I gave it a quick read before I wrapped it up for him. The first page (with the shiny spots)is in Spanish! Ugh, so disappointed and annoyed, I feel like the Usborne quality department should have caught this before it reached the customers as I know this wasn't something that happened to just one book."
3,The Ground Truth,"This was a good DVD, but I would have appreciated some sort of analysis or summary of what was shown. I am not talking about coming to some definitiveconclusion, but ""pointing"" to what appears to be happening and the possiblereprecusions down the road."
2,Lame Movie,"Very narrow sighted movie. We all agree war is bad...what is the solution? No suggestions, call to action, just ""war sucks"". Yes, we all know."
2,Islamic propaganda,America is bad for endangering our military to fight terrorists & Islamic extremists . That seems to be the message of this slanted & highly edited treatment . It is a real encouragement to the true enemies of the world . It also increases the danger to our troops everywhere . Sad !
1,A Grinding LIE....,"What an unobjective piece of garbage 'film'. The reason it took her so long to make it was finding the dishonoable misfits who criticize their country. I thank them for serving, I am sorry for their injuries, yet I cannot forgive their point of view. If you want Liberal garbage, this is it. Too bad I was forced to give it one star.Gary"
1,unfair and completely unbalanced,"This film is nothing more than left wing fodder compromised of interview footage of 9-10 soldiers vehemently against not only the war in Iraq, but the act of war itself. Several of the testifying soldiers were filmed in multiple settings to give the impression that many more soldiers were being interviewed than actually were. This, of course, undermines the intelligence of the average viewer, but then again, that target demographic (impressionable youth and/or less than intelligent) is whom this film is aimed at anyway...If you are a ""Bush-Basher"", you will enjoy the ""more of the same"" tired arguments against the war. On the other hand, if you lean the slightest bit to the right, you may wish to steer clear of this film...garbage propaganda (again)."
4,Reality Check of Iraq War,"Ground Truth provides an honest insight of the tragic and stupid nature of the Iraq ""war"". It reaffirms what most Americans know about how we as a people have been duped by a small number of ""neocon"" radicals. The human & economic cost is borne out by ""The Ground Truth"" with the focus on the terrible impact on our military, & their families.What is missing is an answer to how the American people can regain positive control of their government. This is a must see for all Americans!"
5,Wonderful,This cast is excellent. I enjoyed the performance and this DVD. Pavarotti and Battle's performance gave me a great emotion. A wonderful interpretation of Dara (marvelous basso buffo) and Pons (officious Belcore).Extraordinary!
4,Perfect but marred with Pavarotti's performance,"What a delightful and fun opera. I disagree with others too. In all respects 5 stars. This is not a dream cast unless you close your eyes when Pavarotti is on stage. His golden voice is now a silver voice. And he is a large lump on the stage with absolutely no acting ability. Opera singers should be judged on their voice, acting ability, stage presence and presentation. His costume was literally a tent due to his massive size. He was hardly engaged with the cast and certainly not a credible love interest for Ms. Battle. A buffoon yes. I now will search for another Elixer of love with a tenor with better acting ability. If you want to see acting watch Domingo in Carmen and Pagliacci."
4,L'Elisir d'Amore,"Biscuits O'bryan: Texas Storyteller (Texas Heritage)This opera, like most,has a silly love story, but the music is spectacular, especially Pavarotti's aria, ""Una Furtiva Lagrima."" That song alone makes this a worthwhile purchase."
1,Un-Impressive,I purchased this DVD after watching an opera on PBS TV. But then I found out it was not the same opera performance. This opera performance is not so good.
5,High Quality. Smooth Writing. Comfortable.,"These are the better quality pens your grandma told you about. Not myths. These are legends. Like most of the uni-ball pens, these are worth the expense. They last a long time. They do not smudge easily or quickly. They are smooth and very comfortable. I have yet to have one spill ink. They are durable and attractive. Simple, useful, well-made. What else could we ask for?"
2,"Go dark tanning lotion, by synergy","This is a good tanning lotion for basic tanning, but if you want a tingle or HOT lotion this is not what you need. I have always used a HOT or Tingle lotion. This lotion does not have the hot or tingle feeling at all. My daughter does not like the tingle or hot and she uses this lotion."
3,Location is important,"The unit has great sound and picture, but this is an LCD screen, and viewing from an angle is not possible. You need to look at the screen straight on or you can't see the picture. Would NOT recommend mounting it under a kitchen cabinet which is what it is designed for. I can't believe that AudioVox would design and market this unit for that purpose ! I bought it to mount under a kitchen cabinet, and was VERY disappointed ! YardDeal would NOT take it back, so be careful who you buy it from !!"
2,Scratched,The product looked good on the outside but once I started viewing the videos almost everyone of the would freeze or skip.
1,"Great show, bad dvd !!!","I love this show : it's really funny, sarcastic and intelligent. It's a very good criticism of politic, religion, and the American way of life.So I decided to order it to be able to watch the uncut and uncensored episodes ; and also to have the subtitles because I don't speak English perfectly.The dvds arrived scratched (most of them) and wouldn't play ; so of course I exchanged them. The same thing happened : I'm pretty sure it's because of the poor quality of the packaging. So I asked for a refund (Amazon was really professional and fast by the way).I'm very disappointed, so I'm gonna try to buy the seasons separately, waiting for a good deal, because right now it's way more expensive compare to the box set."
4,Interesting but Incomplete.,Author needs to expound on the future disposition of Marcos's wealth inherited by his children. Also of the children of his first common law wife.
5,Ruby is one of the greatest,"She has such a charming voice and is such a beautiful and friendly person. She does great live performances and if you love soul music, she is a must. This album was mainly recorded with Womak & Womak. It's smooth and honest and has a bit of Raeggae influence too (Ruby is from Jamaica). Beautiful songs and a heartfelt production."
5,An exciting look at life under Communist rebels.,"I found the Wooden Ox to be exciting and authentic - even though Ms Hardy admitted it was a compilation of several missionary stories. It was written in a lively, realistic style, so that I was surprised to read that it was not the actual account of a real kidnapping. The young, self-centered heroine's thoughts and actions were typical of teen-agers everywhere. I have so much respect for anyone who is called to be a missionary in Third World countries."
3,Comments on The Wooden Ox,"This story has a strong aura of authenticity--what it could really feel like to go on a forced march through jungle, fearing for your life, knowing that friends may already be dead. The author vividly describes the war-torn small African country of Mozambique, where she and her family lived during its bitter civil war. Not only is the setting unusual and compelling, but the plot--about an American missionary family captured by rebel guerillas--grips the reader from start to finish. Psychological and spiritual insights are also convincing; for example, under severe stress the young heroine finds herself doubting even her father's integrity. Well written, with glossary and an informative historical afterword, the book would appeal to both general-interest readers and those with a religious interest."
4,Better than the disney version? In my opinion definately!,"This is with out a doubt the best version I have seen yet and ever will again more than likely! The disney version is super boring and uninteresting to me. I think this one's better cause the songs are better and the plot is more emotional and far more romantic to me. The acting is great too. This version is as close to the origional grimm fairy tale as you can get. For one the queen gets snow white with the corset,the comb,AND the apple. I could watch this over and over (and I have since recieving it on monday!)It was well worth the 59.99 I paid for it. I highly recomend this and the rest of the cannon movie tales"
5,Excellent Study of How Nazi Germany Lost the Air War,"Williamson, a noted historian of flight and air war, paints a compelling picture as to why Nazi Germany's air force fell to the Allies, despite its notable early successes. Unusual for studies of this sort, Williamson's book is filled with photographs and graphs which clearly and effectively outline the trajectory of the Luftwaffe's early victories and subsequent (and inevitable) defeat. His description of the dysfunctional leadership at the very top of the Luftwaffe and the Nazi hierarchy show how they paved the way for defeat by mid-1944. One of Williamson's major contributions is his explanation of the role of the production of aircraft, pilots, and spare parts - things that are all too often left out of histories of aerial warfare. This is a well-written, highly informative work that is a must for anyone seeking to understand how and why air forces win or lose wars."
5,Definitely NOT a book to pass up!,"I FOUND THIS REVIEW ON ANOTHER SITE AND COPIED IT HERE:This book is very well written... sensual and romantic as well as sexual. It is in no way crude or offensive, and I would challenge anyone to point out a part that is badly done.The attack of an earlier reviewer on the publisher certainly served to make the review sound much more like comments from a disgruntled author than an honest, unbiased opinion of the work supposedly being reviewed.I, for one, am not afraid to put my name on my comments and to openly discuss this book with anyone who has a differing opinion. I truly hope that readers will be open-minded enough to see that the praise of this book far outweighs the negative comments of one unidentified reviewer, and will treat themselves to this gem of Erotica, and make up their own minds!"
2,try something else,Half of this cd is truly awful. It remainsa mystery why they did not simply reissuethe original goin out of my head album.
2,I just hoped for a different ending,"After reading Downbelow Station (highly recommended), I ventured into Serpent's Reach. Exceptional story telling and witt. At times I would just have to smile and admire the depth and complexity of this amazing plot. Cherryh does a great job of letting us in on the way a different species thinks, feels and communicates. Her ability to do this is second to none. My only complaint about this story (spoiler alert) is that Raen really doesn't save the day. As a matter of fact she makes things worse. Everything around her is disruppted, destroyed or dies. I was anticipating some remarkable twist that would make all things right, but it never came."
3,BETTE JINXED!,"In this film, the full-legth motion picture follw up to THE ROSE, Bette is less serious than THE ROSE and not as funny as her follow-up DOWN AND OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS. There was more drama behind the scenes to this movie than the movie itself. Based on the movie DOUBLE INDEMNITY with Barbra Stanwick, a story of how a woman tries to kill her husband, collect the money and run off with her new love. Bette adds a little humour to the role. The highlight, of course, is the shower scene with her dead husband and black humour. If you're a Midler fan, it would be interesting to see her in this film in her early comic stages. But don't expect the comic genious in the string of hits to follow:DOWN AND OUT..., RUTHLESS PEOPLE and OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE."
3,movie,Funny and entertaining. My mother in law loves this movie. Bette Milder as alway is great. B rated movie though.
2,Shame it was set in Hickville,"This film had some good moments, however the setting in rural Nevada doesn't help, too many redneck hicks, would have been better in Atlantic City, a tougher setting not held back by primitive 19th century environments"
2,Definately Not Your Best Bette...,"Despite her screen presence even the multi-talented Bette Midler could not save this lame-ass attempt at a black(cat) comedy. The best performance comes from Rip Torn and he dies half way into the picture. Ken Wahl as a love interest for Bette? I don't think so. He looked like he wanted to leave the movie, hunt down his agent, ""Wiseguy"" style and waste 'em. I have never given a Bette Midler movie a bad review, but this one IS BADDDDD!!! Its so bad the DVD comes with its own odor. Its a stink-a-roo. It gets one extra star because I did laugh twice, and one scene was very funny. It had nothing to do with the movie, but it was funny. This movie makes ""Rhinestone"" shine if one could imagine that possible. However, if you collect Bette movies then you must own this one. Its safe there will be no sequel, and I think she's learned not to do lame comedies. No, wait! Well you really can't count that sitcom, can you? Ouch!"
2,It was just OK but not worth owning.,This movie was rated R for some foul language and a nude Rip Torn in case you were wondering. This is a dark romantic dramedy with few laughs. If you love Bette Midler than maybe you should rent it or buy for less than a buck but other than that she has few one liners and plays a con artist who hates her husband. Bette's charming personality doesn't shine in this movie like in Beaches or Stella instead it is annoying like her character in The Rose. Overall the plot is redundant and spins in circles. Mr. Wahl looks great physically and the women might like that aspect of this movie.
3,Up Against the Wahl,"It is unfortunate that this little comedy has been so cruelly maligned, by even Miss Midler herself. So it wasn't high art. So it set her then promising film career into a (temporary) downward spiral. So it wasn't the ideal vehicle to follow The Rose. So what! Bette did her best against the horrible machismo of Ken Wahl [whatever became of him, and who even cares?]. Also, the uncooperative & unsympathetic Don Siegel [again, who cares?]. Legend, and loads of bad press, had that she was very much a diva. Well, why not? It was her career, not the men, that was set to skyrocket or spiral, not theirs.Often have I played this little trifle on rainy weekends with friends (or alone) & we hold our sides with laughter. I saw it many times from opening through it's abbreviated theatrical run. Other fine (some better, some worse) comedies have followed, but it is long, long overdue on DVD. I will again watch...and laugh. Praise be the always Divine Miss M!"
2,A really bad movie for three stars,"The superstitious nature of the concept of a ""jinx"" is behind this movie.In Little Abner there is a character with a cloud over his head and lightening strikes him from it periodically: symbolizing his jinx.Here we have a black jack dealer in a casino in Nevada who isis followed by his ""Jonah"". The whole movie is on this theme of luck with murder thrown in. It just isn't believable that three modern people could act this stupid? Maybe if they set this in ancient Greece,people might be able to take this level of gullibility?All of the stars of this movie deserve a better script than this."
3,Bettes cool but.....,"A light weight gambler movie with some kind of humour. Theres Bette and her bloke, hes awful and punch happy, and they live in a caravan. Then Bette meets this other dude and hes handsome and cool. They have a secret wham bam momment and then plot to finish off the other dude or get rid of him somehow. But the plot really thickens. The bad dude plays poker one night and does so badly he goes home and electricuts himself in the shower. And then the fun really starts with insurance companies and lots of tricky situations. Bette must of needed cash or something to do this movie cause till now I thought it was imposssible to see a bad Bette movie. But this wins that prize. No heart touching music or even barely ok. Very not my kind of humour to american slap stick stuff."
2,"Useful, but Could be Better","The Hebrew typesetting is very poor, making it difficult for someone who is learning the language. The Greek is better, but still looks like a bad photocopy. Contrast this with almost any English-only Bible where the type is sharp and clean."
1,Interlinear Bible,Font so tiny that I had to return the book. Would need divine eyes to be able to even read this print.
4,The Interlinear Bible: Hebrew-Greek-English,"This has been a wonderful resource for a second semester Biblical Hebrew student. I use it in translating from the Hebrew Bible, when I get stuck. By seeing how someone else translates the particular word(s), I can usually then find it BDB or other lexicon. Can see where it would be useful also for the Greek."
2,Interlinear Bible review,What it contains is priceless. I purchased this for my Father on Christmas. For as great as a gift and spiritual knowledge this book contains the font was WAY to small for my father to read..Even I had to strain to read it and Im in my mid 20's with great Vision.Great Content. But they seemed to have crammed tooo much onto each page. I don't recommend it for someone hard of sight or without PERFECT vision.
4,A Buyer's Review,"I have found this Bible to be a very good buy. It is basedon the Strong Concordance, which I have. It helps me to betterread and understand my King James Bible. I love it.ThanksWanda"
4,Almost Excellent!!,"This is a wonderful book, all in all. It is great to have the original words translated to understandable English. I read it everyday, and use it to teach Bible study class on the Sabbath each Saturday. The only problem it has is that the columns of text beside the original translation column (a column which takes the translated text and puts it into a more readable English flowing context) has several mis-spellings. I'm not sure how that can even happen. But even simple words like ""and"" may be spelled ""ans"", etc. Its not enough to make you want to put it down, but it is disappointing and perplexing to find mis-spellings in a book for sale, in this day and age of spell-checkers and all. Anyway. I do recommend it for sure, because we all need to stay as close to the original language meaning as possible. Just know that this book is sprinkled with mis-spellings here and there throughout. No biggy."
4,"Admirable, used Jehovah, instead of a meaningless ""The LORD""","I was most surprised to find that Mr. Green used the proper divine name JEHOVAH instead of an inequivalent and inaccurate ""The LORD"". Very well done. Although yes the fonts are small, you have to take into consideration that if he used a larger font we would have ended up with two or three volumes,instead of an easy to handle volume. One thing... what happened to the divine name where the Greek scriptures quote directly from the Hebrew scriptures where the divine name is used???"
2,Font so small and printing so bad it actually omits masoretic vowels,"It's very simple: the Hebrew font is not just very small (other reviewers said be sure to have a magnifying glass); the font is so small and the ink weak enough that about every two or three words in Hebrew, at least one of the masoretic vowel markings is gone! Yes, just plain gone! This renders the text worthless for students of Biblical Hebrew. It would be great if I could just read the Hebrew text in this book and have the interlinear translation right there, but I have to actually use a JPS version of the text in order to get the vowels right and then switch back to this text. Very disappointing. There's nothing wrong with printing so small but make sure that the entire word is printed."
4,"Good, but translation is not always scholarly enough for me.","I'm generally very happy with this interlinear Bible. I can only speak for the Hebrew section, but I must say there were points here and there where I was less than impressed with the the 'word for word' translation elements. They appeared to ignore common scholarly convention (and very rarely were flat out wrong) and the uneducated would probably not pick up on this. Nevertheless, I found it useful as a quick reference backup to my own Hebrew-English translations using quality lexicon sources such as BDB or Holladay. However, I would not rely on the interlinear 'word-for-word' translation as final close translation, its just too inaccurate. Overall though, if you know what you are doing, or on the other extreme, don't really care, then it's good stuff."
3,Interlinear bible,Several verses and words are missing in the english translations. It is also missing several concordance numbers as well.
3,Greek/Hebrew Interlinear Bible,Regrettably the print was so small that I had to return the book. Although it looked as if well put together there was too much information which required excessively small print to publish.
4,a great study tool,although the book is large and the print is small it has proven to be one of my favorite study tools. I love the accurate Hebrew translation that it gives right below each hebrew word. I would highly recommend this book to anyone considering a serious study of Hebrew..or Greek.
4,Very pleased,"Great Bible for those seeking to understand the scriptures at a deeper level. I've thoroughly enjoyed comparing different verses but still need a good concordance with the word numbers to find all references to given words. Also, on the downside, this Bible will not make you an instant linguistic expert so have realistic hopes about what you will get out of it."
5,Satisfied Preacher,"I would highly recommend ""The Interlinear Bible: Hebrew-Greek-English"" by Jay Green to any minister who may be rusty on their languages. I particularly appreciate the cross reference with Strong's Concordance."
5,This is a wonderful tool for Bible Study.,This is a wonderful Bible study tool. It helps to get a clearer picture of the original meaning and helps in learning the ancient languages as well. The print is small but clear. I would recommend this edition and seller to anyone interested in this item.
5,GREAT workout..,"I was never a good at home workout person until NOW! this dvd set is great...when I can't make it to the pop physique studio to workout, i use these and its great!!!"
4,A good start to barre,I really like these videos I have taken barre classes for almost a year 2 times a week. These are similar and keep your heart rate up the classes are more challenging but these videos are a good substitute for when I am not able to go to class.
3,An okay workout.,The videos are not as challenging as other Barre videos/classes. The abs section isn't that great at all. Womp womp.
2,Is this the 80's?,"Basic barre work, the wardrobe is so over the top you can't get past how awful it is to look at-made disco look good. The material is average barre, voice could be toned down there are better quality products available."
2,"Poor product, poor return policy, but portion of return made","The purchased item, slimming jacquard tapestry strapless corset, was perhaps the worst item I have ever purchased online. The item actually felt like paper, and was very poorly constructed. I attempted to contact the seller a number of times over as many days about a quick return, and finally the seller responded after about a week, and authorized a return minus the shipping costs and a 25% restocking fee. The seller obviously does not stand by their product in that regard. I paid about $55 including shipping and was refunded about $35. An expensive return. I appreciate that the return was made, but it took quite some time for my credit card to be refunded after I had shipped the item (about 2 weeks)and quite some time to get a response. I hesitate to give 2 stars, but the return was made, if at least in portion. If I could give half stars it would be 1.5 Will not do business with seller again."
2,poor product but very helpful & gracious seller,my corset arrived with frayed lacing & the item itself was flimsy. i contacted the seller & they were extremely helpful & cooperative & gave me a full refund. their attitude more than made up for the condition of the product. it's unfortunate that i was unhappy with the item seeing as the seller has such good customer service. they've been incredibly generous in giving me a full refund. thank you.
3,Operatic History and Biography of Ernestine Schumann-Heink,"As a direct descendant of Madame Ernestine Schumann-Heink, I found this book to have little biographical information but it is loaded with operatic history of this great dame of the Opera. Madame Schumann-Heink was a well known citizen of the United States during the early part of the 20th century and this book covers in detail the history of her operatic performances and her appearances before the american public."
5,Best DE razor I have.,"This is the best. The adjust-ability is the key. I adjust it down after my first pass with the grain and can go against the grain and adjusting it down even more, can do buffing around the chin and can even go against the grain on the upper lip. The weight is very nice as well, it is heavier than the Merkur 180.I started with the Merkur 180. I liked it and wanted to get one with a butterfly open so I got the Parker 82r. I like the butterfly open and it looked better and was heavier than the Merkur 180, but surprisingly did not shave as well. Eventually, I decided to get this one and couldn't be happier."
4,A Solid Choice for DE Shavers,"I've been shaving with the Merkur Classic for several months now. It's a very good shaver with Merkur DE blades. A few weeks ago I tried switching to Feather DE blades. Now this razor really sings. I'm using it with some Taylor's Avocado and Proraso shave cream. I alternate between the 2 for a change of pace. If you like razor that's a bit more agressive, you'll like the Merkur. The blades you use make all the difference in how this razor shaves."
2,Good Book!,"The thing that disappoints me is. The fact that this Shrek is the same as the movie. I found a few goofs in the book regarding one left out word. And, another word that should of been left out. The only thing I would say is. This book is a good version of the movie. I would recommend the other Shrek."
1,Read the Original,"If you like the story of Shrek that you saw on the movie screen, I supposed you'd like this version of that story. But, if you want the original Shrek, please read the book by William Steig. You will find a different story, but you'll find the real thing.One objection to the movie's story - supposedly the message was that it doesn't matter what you look like. But it makes fun of short people.One other note: all of the young reviewers of this Ellen Weiss version of Shrek need to go back to school and take some spelling lessons."
4,Wish the ending was longer,This was a good book but I had to give it 4 stars because the ending could have ben a little longer..
1,One of The Worst of Diana Palmer's!,"I'm a die-hard Diana Palmer fan, but this one is so full of so many details that just don't add up(like the hero who was introduced as a marketing genious near the beginning of the story turnning out to be a totally stupid man business-wise throughout the rest of the story -- like not even having had a website for his cattle business for years & having hired his physical admirer as his secretary even though he had known full well that she had never had any sorts of secretarial training/experience what-so-ever)!Anyone with an ounce of sense can't possibly give this one more than a 1 star!"
4,Circle of gold.. life and its twists of fate.,"I,love Diana Palmer ,s writing I am a big fan of hers ,and this book is a sample of her talent at writing a sweet love story.with all the trials and tribulations of life."
2,The Acts of the Apostles,"I am a professor in a Bible Institute. This is an excellent devotional commentary on the book of Acts, however the cost of the commentary new is disproportionate to the limited number of pages in this very thin paperback book. $9.99 is a very high cost for 73 pages. I cannot rate this item highly due to the excessive price charged."
2,Not as advertised ...,Received the correct quantity but came as loose items in an envelope and not in a box for easy retrieval... had to find my own container to store these in.
4,Tylenol Packets Arrived in Tact,"After searching for this product I was able to process my order for 50 packets of the 2-caplet dosage. Later that week I received an e-mail from the seller, with apologies, letting me know that they were out of stock and would not be filling my order. Then the following week an 8-1/2 x 5-1/2 envelope arrived in the mail, stuffed with fifty (50) packets of Tylenol. As you might expect I was a bit surprised and even confused. In the end I got what I ordered, I guess..."
3,Got this fast... but,"When it came in the mail, it was in a flat padded envelope. I open it and see the individual packaging, but not in the original box as seen in the picture. They must of took it out of a really big shipment and count it out then ship.I like me stuff in the original package so I know its authentic.But, since it didnt come that way, I was a little worried.But then, I use a few of them anyways.GL. Hope yours come in the original box for safty."
4,Good for Pain,This product is good for relieving any type of pain. Like the package so you can easily take it with you. Would recommendthis product to anyone.
4,Came as it should have,Nothing bad to say. It was something I need and ordered it. Came as it was supposed to come as. Nothing negative about the product or the shipping or the seller since it's a basic everyday thing.
5,Exactly what I expected and fast shipping,I received this item within 4 days of my order.The parcel arrived in great condition and was exactly what I thought it would be when I placed the order.
2,Bad Description,The item description is incorrect and I was mislead. The box only contained 25 packets of two tablets each not 50 as the description leads you to believe. Yes. technically the math is correct 25 packs x 2 tables = 50 but I expected 50 packets. I would not buy this agian via amazon. I did get a box of 50 packets from CVS.
4,It is a good guide for Big Red,"For a Clymer book, it is good to have on hand. I will be using in addition to How to Keep Your Honda Atc Big Red Alive: A Manual of Step by Step Procedures Anyone Can Follow."
3,"Good, but not their best","Pretzel Logic Has a few great songs, but lacks the consistency of Countdown to Ecstasy and Katy Lied. The second half is definitely the Dan at their most bland. Only for serious dan fanatics. After all, you can own ""Rikki Don't Lose that Number"" on Decade."
2,Big dissapointment,"Having already owned the first mini lp printing of this disc, I was looking forward to this SHM version. I was extremely dissapointed. To my ears this sounds the same as the previous issue. Moreover, the cardboard is flimsy and the printing quality of the cover is inferior to the first printing which was very well done. This was not worth Fifty dollars. If anyone is interested in the mini lp version I would recommend getting a used copy of the first printing available for half the price. Buyer beware!"
4,Eclectic and Different Record,"The Pretzel Logic disc has jazzier and more experimental material and is probably not as familiar to most listeners as other Steely Dan albums. Very interesting song structure on ""Through with Buzz"" and ""Barrytown"" ...""Parkers' Band"" is also very strong and this album doesn't have the technical (hiss/high EQ) problems of Katy Lied.......definitely a good purchase if you want to round out your collection of Steely Dan with less familiar but classic tracks."
4,Smart and fun,"This dynamic duo seemed to be on an undeniable roll at this point, proving that radio-friendly rock could be accessible as it is complex. Plenty of classic rock, funk, and blossoming jazz influences coupled with what was then their trademark intelligently smooth writing, solidified PL's classic status with a diverse spectrum of rock that sounds nearly as vibrant today than it must have upon first appearance, and a few cuts which probably sound better ."
5,Early Steel Dan rocker...,"Early Steely Dan and more rock oriented, but many popular plays contained. Still a tight sound for some good jazzy-rock."
4,Essential Steely Dan,"This album is mostly known for Steely Dan's most famous song, ""Rikki Don't Lose that Number"" which has a strange intro to it that is usually cut out when played on the radio. The three bass notes afterwards are a more well known intro.However, there is plenty more to enjoy about this album, like the underrated title track ""Pretzel Logic"" which has a great bass/guitar sound and strange lyrics.""East St Louis Toodle-Oo"" is a short instrumental song, origionally written by Duke Ellington. It was included on ""A decade of Steely Dan"" but not on ""Show Biz Kids"" for some reason.The other great tracks on this album are Night by Night, the underrated ""Parker's Bend"" and the great ""Any Major Dude Will Tell You"""
5,PARKER WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD,MY STRAW IS THAT PRETZEL LOGIC IS CLEARLY THE BEST STEELY DAN ALBUM EVER MADE. ONE TIME I GOT SO CAUGHT UP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM WHILE DRIVING MY CAR THAT I ALMOST HAD A WRECK.
4,mustard for the pretzel,"Just a note on the sonics of the remaster vs. the 1993 box set disc of the same title, while I would give the nod to this 1999 (not 1990 amazon) remaster, it is just barely better sounding. There is a little more detail or resolution if you will especially in the background keyboard fills on Rikki... than on the 93 disc. I would not run out and buy all (is there more than 2) the 99 remasters to replace my 93 editions. Great stuff none the less."
5,Any major dude will tell you this cd rules,"SD made a great one on this recording. The tight jazz rock fusion sounds and impossible to detect any air in the studio type of perfection make the grooves, which are everywhere on this recording, SD legendary.Any Major Dude Will Tell You is totally infectious in its pretentiousness, and you will find every song easy to sing to, even if you don't have a singing voice.A classic"
4,4 1/2 stars.,"1972 through 1975 was steely dan's greatest streak. ""countdown to ecstasy,"" is my favorite work by this great band, but ""pretzel logic"" is there nipping at its heels. this is exquisite pop/rock music, best heard through headphones, because the songs are alive with complexity, beautifully constructed pieces. lot's of great guitar here, too. and the good time cheer of ""east st louis toodle-do,"" and ""parker's band,"" is infectious. freaky lyrics, strange harmonics, and melodies that go every which way, but always down roads that are accessible and a joy to follow. this album is something special, indeed."
3,Duplicate book of Close Up,Don't get me wrong - I adore Kelly Hoppen - but I don't know what her publishers are playing at. They publish the exact same titles and content - with different covers - under different ISBN numbers. So now I have TWO books with the same content (one entitled Close Up and the other Monochrome Home). So much as I love her and I think this book is excellent - I really didn't need to end up with two.Here are the lists of books that are duplicate but look very different if you look at her covers:Kelly Hoppen The Golden Rules of Design (two versions)Monochrome Home and Close Up are the exact same book with the exact same contentsHome has two different covers...Don't judge these books by their covers - they are probably the same ones underneath!!!
1,Not easy to use or fugure,The phone system that this works with is to complicated to use and it is not easy to find instructions for.
4,Superb Beethoven,"I recently discovered Viktoria Mullova while cruising Amazon's Classical Music. After listening to a few selections, I bought most of her CD's. I would rate Mullova as among the absolute finest violinists on the planet, with perfect technique and sublime expression. Her playing of the Beethoven Concerto is now my favorite. HOWEVER....I have to agree with reviewer Susan Scheibner who complained about the recording. I have to adjust the volume continuously. From around level 13-15 during the orchestra's loudest sections to 20+ during Mullova's solos. This is extremely irritating, but this version of Beethoven's incredible Violin Concerto is worth the trouble. Five Stars for Mullova, zero stars for the recording. I have a similar volume problem on Anne Sophie Mutter's early recording of the Beethoven Violin Concerto with Herbert Von Karajan."
4,Good,"I like John Saul's books a lot. He's my 2nd fav. author. Dean Koontz takes the boat as the best. This book is very typical of other of Saul's books, the teens get the ""axe""--so to speak. I liked it, but the end was often hard to follow, maybe it's just me...good friendly read overall. One scene was so detailed (when Jed is crawling through the tunnel) that I had to stop reading, and stretch out my legs for I have a small case of claustrophobia."
5,One of the most suspenseful books ever!,"Borrego, New Mexico is a peaceful little desert town. There's just one thing, someone hates teenagers. These trouble makers have to be controlled. Silenced. Forever. He has discovered a way to get back at them. In the night, in their waking hours, whenever. He is a madman with terrifying powers. Soon....he'll draw the children of Borrego beyond the brink of night......"
2,Lacking in Imagination,"I'm not sure why this book has got so many good reviews. I found it to be extremely lacking in imagination and originality. Saul didn't show me anything new with this book and I wasn't inspired whilst reading it. In fact, I felt myself laboring all the way through it. I did not feel for any of the characters and the ending was awful - a definite cop out. I hope other novels by Saul prove to be better than this one or I will have to give up on John all together."
1,Don't waste your time,"This book is a faithful portrayal of John Saul's usual ""talent"" (if you can even use that word in the same sentence as John Saul.) The writing is dull and lack lust, the story progresses at a snails pace, the plot formulaic, and I'm utterly amazed at his thinly veiled plagiarism.Here you can teens and adults dying in their sleep and/or being mind controlled to, say, jump off cliffs. Does that sound familiar? No? Here's another. One of the main (and not so nice) characters is called ""Krueger"" and a lot of this revolves around an oil refinery. Come now. I'm certain you can tell which story he ""borrow"" quite liberally from.How does this author continue to get published?"
4,Cosmic Grooves - Virgo,This is a fun item especially if you are interested in astrology. The music on the CD does seem to fit and the book is interesting. I gave it to a friend for her birthday and she thought it was just great.
2,Not what I expected,"If you like movies with lesbian and gay sex scenes, then this is your movie. I was expecting the explicit scenes, but the story line and the above scenes could have been improved"
2,What a Disappointment,"I must apologize to anybody that found this film enjoyable, first of all. But this is an honest opinion. I saw a few screenshots of this movie before I bought it, the story sounded pretty good and it was based around music, which is always good, and an all girl band, another plus. But after getting this film, I quickly was disgusted with it and refuse to watch it again. I am far from squeamish, but this film really raises the bar on ""disgusting"" and puts it at a whole new level. From highly detailed scenes of men masterbating, for whatever the reason, I just simply found stomach-turning and completely unnecessary. The girl on girl scenes are pretty nice, but it has a plot that is very hard to follow and its vulgarity makes the overall scene not worth getting, not even worth renting. Stay away from this film unless you are into that sort of stuff."
4,Carters Joy Hide & Seek 4 Pack Receiving Blankets,I think this was two to the best items I have purchase here on Amazon excellent quality.
4,Sooooo Soft,I love these blankets...however they aren't the softest receiving blankets I have felt...but they are just as soft as most! They have held up well for the 7-months my son has been in the world.
3,Receiving Blankets,"I purchased this item as a shower gift. I was satisfied with the look of the package and quality of the product. The problem I found was that the ""4"" pack of blankets I ordered only had ""2"" blankets when it arrived. I tried to advise the store of this but ran in to one road block after another and eventually decided it wasn't worth my time to pursue the issue. Since you've give me an opportunity to review the item I am sending this information with the request that I received the 2 blankets I believe I'm owed or an explanation as to why a 4 pack of blankets would contain only 2 blankets. I appreciate this opportunity and look forward to your response. I was pleased with the choices and time in which I received my order. I hope we can get this little glitch straightened out. Regards, Jana Haverty"
3,Not very soft at all - faded colors,"I received this blanket as a shower gift after I listed it on my registry. I have not used it yet, but was pretty disappointed with the very faded colors (not at all how it appears in the picture on the website) and the real lack of softness (I've received many other blankets that are MUCH softer). It looks pretty tough, though, so I assume it will be durable."
4,Great Topical Index,Very good when looking up scripture by topics. Covers many areas of men's lives.I wish the translation was NIV versus New King James.Excellent value for the money.
1,Very poor movie.,Dante's Divine Comedy much better portrayal of the Dante's inferno. This was a very poor quality movie.
4,Be Prepared for the Profane Treatment of This Classic,"I am a college professor and showed this to my World Lit. class. They loved it, but I was embarrassed by some of the profanity and sexual content."
2,Okay at best,Would've been nice if there were no political references and instead to of shown a neutral stance. The book itself is a great read and I suggest that the book is read before watching the biased movie. Overall it is an ok theatrical attempt but I still believe that a better reenactment of the great novel could be made.
1,Item Not Yet Received!,Item ordered 8/24/1l. Have communicated repeatedly with merchant. Charge has already appeared on my VISA bill. As of 9/26 Item STILL NOT YET RECEIVED!!
2,Too large and bulky for me,"I bought this mattress pad because I have neck, back and leg pain and a full size bed. After waiting about 4 days for the pad to uncompress to its full size, I found that when I put my back in the lumbar portion, the rest of me at 5'4 was not large enoguh to fall into the correct foam areas. Also I felt I was being enveloped in foam.It was very uncomfortable. It might be a better fit for 2 taller and heavier people. I coulnd't return it since I did not have the strength to compress it to fitback in the box."
5,Another long term user,"We, too, are now purchasing our third Contour Cloud Mattress Pad. Each has lasted many years without any slumping into the middle or breaking down in any way. My hips are sensitive to pressure, even on our Tempurpedic bed and this pad lets me sleep on my side in comfort for years. I would recommend the Contour Cloud to make any mattress more comfortable."
5,great asian movie.,Beautiful amount of gore and killing. A great film to watch with all your friends.
5,Human preys: Run for your lives!,"Kinji Fukasaku made a superb movie about an apocalyptic future in which violence, overpopulation and depletion of natural resources surround the Japanese environment in the boundaries of the third millennium. A chaotic world is depressed into total anarchy. The young people don't want to know anything about taking classes.But then an injured professor will assume a deadly project: a mortal game where its participants must kill each other until juts one survives, being the winner.And so this horrid human chase will take place into a desert island. A solid script filled of violence but smart reflections about the value of the human life, specially when you are turning around the fists of clock: three days of Darwinian survival.Don't miss it."
3,Good Movie... Not Worth The Hype,"So I read the book, and instantly wanted to see the movie. Turns out, it's banned in the U.S. So I special order it from yesasia.com and watch it. I'll just say one thing ""Pulp Fiction"" was more graphic than battle royale. That being said, if you are in dire need to see this movie, rent it from Netflix."
2,Strange Japanese movie,You have to love Japanese movies otherwise you will switch off after 10 minutes. The story is really crazy and insane. Watch it without any expectation - it can end up being a trash horror movie or a brilliant one.
3,The same but different,"Not as groundbreaking as some think, well done little ""survivor"". Would have liked to see a little more of the politics that led to the island."
4,A cult classic for the ages,"I had seen this movie before at my one friends house and didn't really get a chance to pay attention to it, so i decided to buy it. I was suprised greatly at how great this movie really was. It was just remarkably scripted and the acting was extremely good, even when it was going over the top with it's dark humor (Like the cookies) and the out of this world violence. Really the only things I don't like about this movie is that it is drawn out in some places and the subtitles, not so much that it has them more like you have to be a speed reader to read it. The dvd itself arrived in great condition worked on three different dvd players. All in all it was a great movie and well worth what I paid for it. I recomend it to anyone who isn't faint of heart, enjoys a good story, and has a sick sense of humor."
1,NOT THE REAL BATTLE ROYALE,"This is an edited version that cuts out much of the action.Battle Royale is about gratuitous violence as a window for FOREIGNERS into the truly shocking JAPANESE perspective.In particular, the final battle scene is cut short. I wish I could find the real one. I only saw it on tv-links"
4,cult classic,"This movie is the original, it came out in '99, 13 years before Hunger Games. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie."
2,Disappointing Director's Cut,"Before you type out a retaliatory positive review- read on!I want to start off by saying I absolutely LOVE Battle Royale- It is most certainly on my list of favorite movies. HOWEVER- this 'Director's Cut' is total garbage.Sadly, as with the case for many 'Special Edition' DVDs, Battle Royale: Director's Cut adds unnecessary footage that does nothing to enhance the film. The end is extending by 8 minutes or so - and delves into a sort of epilogue and series of dream sequences.The Battle Royale wiki explains the changes here: (...)No attempt was made to clean up the subtitles: I can ignore misspellings and incorrect conjugations - however at one point the subtitles ran off the screen. The subtitles in the added scenes were far worse than that of the rest of the movie.I am not bashing Battle Royale; I want people to buy the regular version and forget that this Director's Cut is even an option."
5,Amazing!!!,"I first saw this on VHS(copy of a copy of a copy). This is one of my favorite films. I got the DVD(NTSC region 0) the other day .... The sound is amazing. The picture is clear. The VHS copy I had, you could barely see the kids run along the beach and sound was awful. This version will shake your walls everytime the machine gun goes off. This is the first movie that made the neighbors complain about the noise. ... The directors cut version is also already available for NTSC region 0. I hope someday that they release the original in the US and we don't have sit through an awful remake by Dreamworks."
4,Battle Royale is great,"I first heard of the movie Battle Royale through a discussion board and I thought man this sounds like a great movie. So I began looking for it in Libraries, blockbusters and other places I could get a dvd but I had no luck.Then I saw it here on amazon and I bought it and after watching it, I thought it was better then I thought. I had action, gore and some comedy. It had it all. I didnt mind reading the subtitles because the movie was worth it all."
2,Overrated,"Have you read the original novel? If not, then you are totally missing the story behind all this. Maybe people just love action and violence, and not much else... Even taking this purely as a standalone movie, it's not particularly great. Sure, it had a potential of being much deeper and meaningful and showed flashes here and there, but without ever going into the details of why those kids had to fight the fights they fought."
3,"Disturbing, yet Entertaining","One of the most disturbing films I've seen in a while. It is quite entertaining, but lacks plausibility, which is the only real caveat I have about this film. First, the premise itself is surreal, but I guess that was the point, so that's not really a negative. What really bothered me was the extended 5-minute death scenes and how it took 100 bullets from an automatic machine gun to kill one person from 10 feet away (aka the Rambo effect). 3 out of 5 stars for content."
2,It's an ok movie but suspension of belief is necessary,It's an ok movie. It wasn't worth what i paid for it. It's a better purchase at $5 than $10.
5,A great movie for anyone........over 13.,"Japan's economy has fallen. Students are boycotting school. Unemployment rate is at 15%. What does the government decide to do? Pass the Battle Royale Act.Abnormal plot for a movie you're thinking. It is, but still a great movie. The BR(battle royale) act is simple.you gotta kill all your classmates till only one lives.you are given a bag of food , water, and a random weapon. some ppl get lucky and get a gun, and some get a potlid. lolA random class is chosen for this act each yr. this yrs is just anotehr class. but every character has a simple background that is built as long as they live.everyone is different with their ideas. some want to stop this act of horror with peace. others just accept what they have to do. but in the end, love is everyones strongest motivation.you wont be disappointed by this movie. but remember suspension of reality!"
3,read the manga,"After reading the manga, I was expecting a little bit more. A lot more! But this is okay, I guess. There is just a lot more bang for your buck with the manga"
2,Cool previews horrible effects,"The previews to this movie really outlined the awesome and disturbing scenes of the movie but when you actually start to watch the movie, you notice instantly that the attacks are so fake and the action is obviously fake. It's like trying to watch a sixties flick and botice the guy missed the girl with the knife yet she spray blood and acts like she""s dying. It was fPretty bad. Oh and if your English. Don't bother with the language, it's really bad"
4,One world order,"I watched this movie to confirm if it was what hunger games was taken from. Both have children and teens as the fighters, both have total Government control giving the people no rights or freedoms at all. My final conclusion is that this movie is better than hunger games and that both movies are uniquely different."
3,For the Experience Only,"As the title of this review states, Battle Royale is only for the videophile who wants to add to their range of viewed movies. The plot, while barely plausible, provides the energy for this film while the characters are limited to comic book portrayals. Another reason for viewing this film is its similarity to The Hunger Games. Towards the end of the film my main desire was to have the movie end."
5,One of my favourite movies!,"This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I been looking at the websites about ""Battle Royale"" and they might bring a BR 3 out. BR II was a great movie too. But the origional is the best. When I first watched this I didn't get it. But I watched it again like 5 months later and I loved it! I just keep watching it over and over again. I also got this DVD for christmas. If people like gore and action movies then you should see this. You have to have the subtitles on though."
1,Beware this is region B/2,This is a joke trying to pass it off as an US blu ray. This is region B locked UK blu ray. It will not play on your US player. Why are you trying to sell this off to a US site? complete rubbish!US buyers will have to wait for the anchor bay release sometime in 2011/2012.
2,Great idea but disappointing film,"This is no Hunger Games. The idea behind the film may be new at the time the film was shot, but I found the movie thoroughly boring and a complete drag. Many scenes were typically B-movie slash n gore. The actors can't act and the soundtrack is horrendous. Well, at least you can get a good laugh reading the English subtitles. Not a keeper; especially not on bluray."
2,just my opinion,"I read the book before I even knew there was a movie, and I'm glad I did. The book was very good but the movie doesn't have the time to go into the back-stories of the characters and maybe that's why it left me feeling kind of ""flat"". I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you've read the book and just want to see a movie version."
5,Life is a game!,"Battle Royale is a shocking look into a definitely possible scenario:Young 9th graders are drugged and dragged onto an island, provided arms and forced to fight to the death until there is only one left.The film was directed by FUKASAKU Kinji, and the film is one of the best movies I've ever seen."
4,a world that should never be,"This is a sad story, classmates forced to fight each other to the death. Sure you might wish death on some of your classmates, but here we see classmates succumb to paranoia and full on survival instinct. A boy totally enamored by a fellow classmate and on the verge of raping her in this end of the world scenario is stabbed in the groin repeatedly by the dream that turns into a nightmare. A boy seeking out the girl of his dreams is killed by his dream. violence is the god of this movie, and to see friends kill each other is the libation for this new religion. This is definately not a movie to be missed."
1,do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"do not buy this movie-a piece of sh..!!B rated at best! Promises a cult classic, but is so wrong in many ways!"
1,Not a legit Reagion 1 DVD!!!,"I am sad that Amazon is selling this product. It is not a legal licensed Region 1 DVD. It is an all purpose ""All Region"" piece of garbage. I love Battle Royal and would love a legit way to buy the DVD here in the States without wasting my money. I would hold off buying this until a real DVD is available, if that ever happens."
1,I Don't Get It,"I fail to understand how viewers can go on and on about the philosophical/psychological/sociological aspects of this film. It's tacky, badly acted and scripted, and in general a third-rate movie. Perhaps it indeed has a message, but it's lost in the presentation. Not nearly as shocking or controversial as it is made out to be, Battle Royale is a must-miss movie. Watch a film by Kurosawa or Ozu instead if you really want to see good Japanese filmmaking."
2,Ridiculously Cheesy,"I saw a screening of this film in a local cinema last night. I loved the book but I didn't like the film. I think the poor storytelling and character development don't do justice to the book. Plus the acting is bad, the ""special effects"" are terrible (you expect more from a film shot in 2000, even if it was low budget), and it is a very loose adaptation of the original source. I did enjoy the lighthouse scene. I don't understand all the hype about this film but maybe I'm just not familiar enough with the genre or have to learn to appreciate it. Or maybe is a film that is more enjoyable when you haven't read the book. I just cancelled my pre-order and I'm hoping one day Hollywood (Tarantino?) makes a more worthy adaptation."
2,Another over rated movie,"Please do not compare this with Clock Work Orange. It's shame. This movie is shame on director. Cutting many heads or killing more bodies does not prove movie is good. This movie is like B grade stuff.Plot is good, but not the direction or screen play."
1,2 hours of my life that I can never get back.,"I really can't say much more except that this movie completely sucks. I watched it because Quentin Tarantino endorsed it and I have literally lost some of the respect I had for him. I honestly can't say one good thing about the movie. It wasn't even good in a cheesy, cult way. If that is what you are looking for then watch ""Hobo With A Shotgun."". It is 100 times better than this movie."
3,Fight to the death,"This isn`t the best Japanese film i have see. I think the lead actor is good. He is also in the Death Note films. I like some of the music in the film, like for example the Bach song.Picture quality: 3/5This has a lot of DNR. I don`t think there was much grain left after the overuse of DNR. Still, it looks better than the DVD releases. Some stronger colours and what is left of the details and sharpness.Audio quality: 4/5The audio track in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 was pretty strong in my opinion. Good bass and clarity. I don`t remember anything wrong with it.Film: 3.5/5Overall: 3/5"
5,Great movie!,"A blood-filled psychological horror thriller. Full of intense deaths. Japanese with English subtitles. I bought it for a present for a friend, and I want my own!"
3,Crazy,I've seen this a bunch of times and it is much more gruesome then Hunger Games. Definitely go into it with a light mood and low expectations and it won't disappoint.
4,there could still be gold at the end of the rainbow,"Recently i hired out a copy of Battle Royal on dvd and considering that it was the first film i have fully watched with subtitles i was extremely surprised. I am a media student and havr a keen interest in all films and i have to say that i havent seen such a good film for years/ i am a keen fan of films that came out of the eighties and only a few modern films have been able to reach the calibar of this genre. Flms such as ""The Matrix"" & ""Fight Club"" gave me hope that there was still auteurs out there that had the vision of a good film and not just the money involved or the publisity that came along with it but genuienly had good ideas and gambled with this to pruduce films that are at least to say out standing. BR is the lateset film that has the taste of Kubrick and the keen control of lynch and manges to pull off the greatest film of the century through its characterization and origanal plot."
1,are you serious?,"This movie was a major dissapointment. It's one of those movies that leave you feeling ripped off at the end. The acting was BAD. The plot was awesome, thats why I wonder how they screwed it up so bad. I guess it started with one of the ""bad"" kids who had a machine gun that never ran out of ammo throughout the whole movie. And having the ability to ""blow off(so they said)"" any ones head at any time, this should have happened more than once. And when it did happen the student should have latched on to the teacher and taken him down also. LONG AND BORING AND STUPID AND NOT VIOLENT AND YOU BE YOUR OWN JUDGE> THIS IS JUST ONE MANS OPINION."
1,Who approved the cover art?,"Movie = 5 stars. Cover art for this release = No stars. I can't believe this passed approval. The gun is floating in the air, there's no hand holding the weapon. This was put out by a major (?) distributor yet the artwork looks like a bootleg graphic."
1,Could not get past the violent beginning,Adults murdering children set such a dark theme to this movie I could not watch any further than a few minutes. Maybe the movie gets better but I have no desire to discover it's value.
5,Amazing,"Being from the UK I first saw this film ages ago and it is absolutely amazing. Get it on Import no matter what. Being the same age as the children in the film I was able to relate to these characters. It is one of the most emotional films i've ever encountered. Performances are superb, as are the killing scenes. This film is not as violent as everyone makes it out to be. Try and get the 2 disc Special Edition. The film centers around 40 school students being forced to kill each other on a deserted island til only one remains, and their relationships with each other. I never get bored of this film and doubt I ever will. Some scenes are pure horror while otrhers are scenes of beauty."
4,Makes the Hunger Games look very mild,"This is no Hunger Games. This is a gory, violent, bloodbath of a story about a group of Japanese teens stranded on a lonely island and forced to kill each other over a period of 3 days or else face death via remote controlled collar. The actors do a good job of portraying the youths' relationships, enmity, love, regret, and more as they make hard decisions in their brief, remaining time on Earth. Not for the faint of heart."
5,Holds up over time,"Saw this back in 2001 or so. It's definitely stood up over the test of time, and I can highly recommend it to anyone."
5,HUNGER GAMES ZERO,"Yes, this is better than HG, which I saw at the show lsat week. I reson I'm buying BR is because I saw it on Netflix but no subtile. BR is better than HG as there is no story set-up. With BR there is action from the get-go."
4,"Very disturbing, yet strangely appealing...","The first few minutes into the film you are seriously going to wonder what ever compelled you to give this flick a chance, but after watching it from beggining to end, it becomes apparent what a great film this is. It is impossible for anyone to sit through it and not get anything out of it.It is a bit violent (VERY violent) but if you were able to sit through Kill Bill without glancing away from the screen, you can definately handle this film. I recommend it to anyone that has the stomach for it."
5,Fantastic Film,This is a great movie. Its is so disturbing not because a bunch of friends are forced to kill each other but because of the way everything is handled. Every violent act is done is a screwed up humorous way. I prefer this movie over the long winded book which you have to strain yourself to read the violence. Also the manga gets a little boring at times and is more of a porno than anything else. The movie has great acting and is never hard to understand. Its also not 'too artsy'. its perfect. It is way better than the second one. Every character is fully developed and most have back stories. Its hard to do that in any movie especially one where there are so many characters. There was one weird moment where the main girl character has a dream. That's really the only part I didn't understand. In all I would say that this film is a turn gold standard of Japanese films. Its one of my all time favorites.
3,not as strong as the hype,I have read so much about this film and what i read had disturbed me. Kids having to kill each other until their entire classroom is dead and only one survives. It sounds like a twisted concept and a film that would haunt you long after you've watched it. Well it didn't. At least for me it didn't. The acting wasn't bad at all and the english dub was much better than I've heard in most japanese films but the effects were kinda weak. Many gunshots were badly computer animated and even the more simple effects weren't very well done. Maybe i was just expecting to be shocked because i had heard and read so much or maybe that is why i wasn't. I don't honestly know but all in all it wasn't very intense. Instead I recommend The Running Man or Surviving The Game.
3,Not Bad,"It's ok, but the book is infinitely better. I was really expecting a lot more after reading the book and reading the other glowing reviews. I guess there was no choice about using very young actors considering the plot, but with the exception of Noriko, Takako, Shuya, Shogo and of course Kitano, the rest of the acting was pretty bush-league. If you like reading, skip the movie and just read the book. So much more than what you see on screen is contained between those magical pages."
2,The movie is not good,"The quality of the movie was not good, kept buffering for obtain connection and the movie itself was not what I expected. Glad it was over."
4,hunger games I,"in golding's lord of the flies, a class of boys standed on a tropical island reverts quickly to barbarism once all ""civilized"" restraints have been severed...in br, combat SPOILER......SPOILER......SPOILER......to the death is forced by adults on a class of 15 year olds (boys and girls), as a rather dubious means of restoring discipline to a shattered culture. i believe that is gogo (chiaki kuriyama) i find in the part of takako chigusa."
2,Phoned it in,"While I am a Glencannon fan, this one was not good enough. It should have been called T.A.M.G.It read like Norman Raine wrote it and left space to insert Glencannon later. There were no plot twists I couldn't see coming a nautical mile off. I read it all the way through, hoping it would get better, but there were times I was on the verge of just setting it down unfinished."
5,Only for Die Hard KISS Fans,"This DVD is fun, but only for Die Hard Make-up KISS Fans because it's pretty lengthy and features a lot of backstage kinda stuff, photo shoots, stage design, rehearsal footage and whatnot. It could get kinda boring for casual fans. There aren't many full Concert performances on this one. You should be into the Reunion stuff too, cuz there isn't much coverage on the 70's era. I mean it's called The Second Coming, so obviously it's about the reunion. It's definitely fun to watch though and i dig it. The rehearsal footage is awesome to see. It covers the best parts of the Reunion if you're into it."
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is the Video we always wanted to have. Well, maybe the best rock video of all times?"
5,Welcome To The Show,"This KISS video is just incredible! Friends of mine with only casual interest were completely riveted. A KISS fan (including myself) would be euphoric. Also, the packaging is of the highest quality including a full-color booklet. If you wanted the best, this video is the best. The very best!"
5,Everything You've been waiting for!!!!!!!!!!!,"The x-tra 32 pge booklet that the video comes with is a nice bonus. There is also plenty of music from the old days in the background. It's nice to know that Duece, Strutter, and DRC are not the only songs heard by all of us kiss fans!!!!!!! Check out this video!!!!!!!!"
5,Lifelong KISS fan,"I've been a KISS fan since I was about four years old. I was turned onto KISS by my mom's youngest sister, Jane. My aunt married young and after she married, my aunt gave me a bunch of her old KISS records. I've been a huge fan ever since. If you only ever own one KISS dvd, I highly recommend this one! I saw the original four on the first reunion tour back in 1996 and I was not disappointed. I've probably watched my dvd copy of ""The Second Coming"" a good dozen times. I think you'd enjoy it!"
2,Not worth it,"As a 20+ year KISS fan, I was very interested to see what they had come up with for their newest DVD. After watching this two hour documentary, I was quite disappointed. The picture quality during the first hour is very poor, and the documentary rambles on with no particular theme. The band constantly displays their larger than life egos, and the numerous scenes showing footage of girls baring their breasts at concerts seems awfully tacky to show over and over again. The lack of uninterrupted concert footage, other than the three songs at the end, was disappointing. After you watch this video once, it is unlikely you will ever want to view it again."
5,"Not Just Five Stars, But At Least TEN STARS","WOW! THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE VIDEO. BET THAN ANYTHING!!! COMPLETE FOOTAGE OF OLD AND NEW!!!! GREAT WOMEN IN IT TOO!!!! IF YOU ARE A KISS FAN, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE THIS!! ROCK ON BABY!!"
5,WELCOME TO THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!,"This is the hottest homevideo in the history of the hottest band in the world !!!!!!!!!! This is the definitive vision of a REAL ROCK`N`ROLL BAND! This guys really show how the Big Guys do , and show to the rest of the bands how to do it. And show one more thing; THE BIG GUYS ARE BACK , AND BACK FOR REAL!!!The lies about the band`s union is over , there`s no lies here. Now sit back and enjoy the second coming , of the definitive vision of a real rock`n`roll band."
1,TOTALLY WASTED - TYPICAL KISS,"THis is another made-for-money product by KISS. I love the band, but this VDV is mean, man! After a mind-numbing fast introduction to the beginning of the band's career (with light-fast editing that makes your head spins!, all we've got is an endless collection of footage taken from shows and interviews around the world, without a single one compelte live song displayed without narration. There's no one single interview made direct for the film, containing the band member or their manager or whatever. The DVD is empty, it lacks depth. It could have been great, because they were generous in its running time (122 minutes). But, as it is, it's just garbage."
1,Bad move.....,"What a bad move by my favorite band....Second Coming is one of the worst things presented in KISS catalogue. It's a cheap ""documentary"" that documents nothing, due to the sheer speed of it and the lack of concrete concert footage.As we all know, the reunion tour was a one-shot project, because the original line-up parted ways again after PSYCHO CIRCUS. THis does nothing more than alert people to the fact that money was their only concern when reuniting."
5,A CRACKING good night at the VCR!,"Everything else being said is the truth. If you've enjoyed this band for a long time, you will have FUN FUN FUN seeing them go through all their paces in this video! The home videos are unusual and GREAT. I was a little reserved about spending the $$$ on this, but it's genuinely worth it if you like KISS at all. Packed with hoots from start to finish, and you just can't get this stuff anywhere else. I only wish they'd have let us see longer cuts of some of the musical performances. Almost every song passes by in 10 seconds or less. Still, it would have taken 10 hours to do this instead of 2. LOTS AN' LOTS O' FUN!!!"
1,They could have done it better....,"How can a product like this have an average review rating of 4.5 stars is beyond my grasp. I like KISS, but this DVD adds absolutely nothing to their filmography. I wodner who had the ""smart"" idea of making a video withoune one single complete live song here.... Who had the ""bright"" idea of making such a fast edition, where you cannot focus at one point for more than half-a-second!!!! Oh, Lord, this could have been a great tribute, the definitive tribute to their reunion but, as it is, it seems just another cheap KISS merchandise..."
3,Cool But Not The Best,"It's a neat insight into the behind the scenes goings on of the Reunion tour and there are some really interesting, insightful and funny moments but the fact is they really weren't getting along by the end of the tour. In hindsight, they probably just should have done something else afterwards. I think it's great they tried with Psycho Circus but the band's personalities are just too different to make it work. It's a shame but the way it goes."
5,The Second Coming captues KISS,"To the point,I've seen KISS a hundred plus times since 74 and I've been with them backstage twice.This dvd is the bomb. GET IT."
2,Where was the proof reader?,"It might be possible to learn the basics of Perl in a weekend by studying this book, IF there weren't so many mistakes and typos in the code examples to slow you down. The author keeps referring to a companion web site from which to download the code if you have problems running the examples. Apparently, it was known early on that much of the code in the book wouldn't work. Frustrating."
4,Perfect if...,"Ok the only thing I can find that I don't like is that I will have preferred if the speaker was facing down so it will have a cleaner look, but otherwise it's perfect. Great deep filling sound, great match for my Onkyo."
4,WOW!!!,witnessed this sub at the local circuit city. I was sitting for a good 30 minutes listening. This is a GREAT SUB. 4 stars because i feel price is a bit steep.
4,Excelent Speakers,Great Speakers specially if you consider the price. Only wish the Black finish would match the wood appearence of the rest of my setup.
2,Nice but Faulty Subwoofer,"I seen this subwoofer at bestbuy for about 400$ + tax, then I checked on amazon.Purchased this from amazon and loved the bass for front room 20-18 room.Sad thing is, this sub just died one week after 3 hours of use.No lights on the back of the subwoofer, reseated all the power cords and played with the switches.This is a great subwoofer if you are the type of person to walk into bestbuy and listen to this and a klipsh and have no clue about bass or audio aka the typical consumer....So I returned this item and bought the Mirage Omni S10.The Mirage weighs more and has more deeper lower bass than this Polk by far.I will not buy another polk sub after this, must have been a crappy built amp that polk decided to use.I am happy with the Mirage Omni S10."
2,Not happy with this sub.,"Sound quality is okay, WHEN IT WORKS!! I'm not working this thing to death, but the circuitry somehow has crapped out TWICE. The newest replacement has a short(a nice hum) so is completely useless. Should have just bought a Klipsch, but I wanted to save a few bucks."
3,Not Overly Impressed,"I listened to this sub in Circuit City before buying here. It sounded o.k. in the store, but once I fired it up at home, I kept saying to myself, ""Is that it?"" My living room is 18' x 20'. I had it turned all the way up while watching movies and listening to some good bass music and neither media made me say ""That's too loud."" The bass was clear but I just expected the amplitude to be higher. The black enclosure is very nice and I really liked the metal front screen (it tends to be rather cat proof). I ended up returning it because ElectronicsUNLTD is NOT an authorized Polk dealer, which means you lose your warranty.If polk made a higher amplitude sub in this same enclosure, I'd be all over it. In the meantime, I'm going to try out the PSW505."
4,Great sub!,"This is a great sub. I must say that it did take a while to ""break in"" and get as deep as it is now. I would say not to expect it to blow you away out of the box but it will come around!"
5,Fantanstic Value ! Great product !!,"I purchased this 12 inch Polk Sub woofer online for $195 plus shipping at expoNJ.com [List and at my local Best Buy was $399] Shipping was the only negative .somewhat slow . Another $30 and it took 2 weeks to arrive. It was perfect, not a second or a refurbished . . It's performance is astounding . . easy to connect, clear instructions, and it can connect to any amp . . you don't need a 'sub woofer output'- just use the existing left and right amp outputs if you don't have a lowlevel connection . . This is my sons who lives on a low bass rumble . . even he is impressed . . I want to steal it from him for my Home Theater surround sound system . . IF there is a better deal on a great sub woofer, I haven't found it yet !!!"
1,Not Worth a Penny.....Worst Book on Amazon,"Have you ever felt that sinking feeling that you have been duped? This is the absolute worst book I have ever read. They say that a monkey if given enough time can write Shakespeare. Well, this is the other book written by a Chimp... and you are a Chump if you buy this. Inside this ""book"" are the most juvenile and painful stories and reviews. My 8 year old grandaughter could write better. I can't say enough bad things about this ""book"". So, don't buy it new, don't buy it used..at any price. Close your eyes and pick any other book on Amazon..you will have made a better choice. An Avid Sci-fi Horror reader."
4,"Please, Not so hard on Universal, They do a great job for the price","In answer to Cesare Petrillo's comments when he says shame on universal for releasing these films, I look at it this way, I bless Universal for releasing any of the old movies on DVD, they may not always be great films, but these are personel to each person who watches them as we all have differant tates, many times have I loved a film that many so called critics hate. but I know one thing, I am glad to have the oportunity to at least see these films in good quality at a resonable price, instead of the alternative which is for these films to gather dust in vast vaults never to see the light of day, so please be kinder to Universal as I think they do a good job. and we all know have the chance to see if we like them or not, remember also, good or bad, these films are all part of our film history and give us the opportunity to see a great star like Cary Grant develope his screen pasona."
4,not great movies but excellent dvd quality,"As a huge Cary Grant fan I bought this collection as soon as it came out and I am very happy about it. The 5 movies are not the best films Grant ever made but the dvd quality is very surprising. The movies are in great condition and you could never tell that you're watching films from the early 30's!There is a very good one in the collection though: Wedding Present is a funny and clever comedy, which reminds me of the great masterpieces of the period. If you are a Cary Grant fan or if you love the period my advice is to buy this dvd collection, considering also the low price and the great quality of the dvd transfer."
5,Great Underrated and Thoroughly Enjoyable,"The Cd collection contains 5 lesser known films of the wonderful Gary Grant. ""Wedding Present"" will not disappoint fans of ""His Girl Friday.""Definately worth the price and the quality is near excellent. Hopefully someone will release all of his other films not available soon. We are waiting patiently."
3,Well...,"I was pretty excited when I got this DVD set. Cary Grant is a good comedic actor and I was curious to see his early movies. To be honest, I was rather disappointed. The quality of the DVDs are good and all of the movies COULD have been good, but they're lacking a certain something...I guess the scriptwriters weren't experts on comedy. The best film by far is ""Thirty-Day Princess"", but the other films are basically just time-fillers for me.If you're a real big fan of Cary Grant, I recommend this box set. But if you're looking for great comedies from the thirties, I suggest you look elsewhere."
5,Great read,"I couldn't put this book down!Although I agree with the booklist review that the mystery was almost secondary, as a long-time Kellerman fan I loved meeting the new character of Koby and I was as interested in that as I was the mystery. I thought it was great to learn more about Cindy too and now I want to go back and re-read Stalker."
2,Tried but failed.....,"This is the first Kellerman book I have read. I knew I was jumping into a character series, so I knew that I would be at a lost sometimes about previous events. But nothing about these characters inspired to want to go back and investigate these events. The ""main"" story - about a baby found in a dumpster had alot of promise but it fell short. The mother was soon discovered, by Cindy talking to a high school class of pregrant girls. Now these girls are street hard, tatooed, young and alot of attitude so how do they notice a girl that may or may not be pregrant that sits on a bench. The whole story just falls into place - too many people that would never talk just seem to want to tell Cindy everything. The sub-plots are as pat in that they provide no challenge.Sorry, to say that I will not backtrack to see why Cindy and her dad are so emotionally distressed nor do I really care what happens in their future."
1,Couldn't get into it,"I really like the Kellermans' books, but this one totally lost me when it compared a character to Kobe Bryant, down to the same first name.It seemed to drag on forever.Not one of her better works, and definately a bad time to use that character. It just ruined it for me."
3,readable but blah,"On the positive side, I did manage to finish reading this book, so it couldn't have been that bad; you could do worse if you are stuck in an airport for a few hours. Having said that, I found it less interesting than the other books in Kellerman's Decker/Lazarus series that I've read; Cindy Decker (the main protagonist of this book) and her boyfriend simply are not as interesting as her father and mother-in-law."
2,Multi Story Line,"Even though I have read several of Kellermans books I could not finish this one . I made it through chapter 6 and tossed the book .There is just to many useless words to take up space that has nothing to do with current storyline . Like author goes into great detail to tell what a house looks like or what character is wearing , and there is parts in book where police's wife has a friend read some sort of Jewish writting for her and the useless words just go on and on . WORST BOOK WRITTEN BY KELLERMAN TO DATE ."
2,Uninvolving unfortunately...,"I've read many of Faye Kellerman's books and have always enjoyed them but this one was really weak. Cindy Decker is not a particularly interesting character and she certainly wasn't helped by a weak plot. I've never been a fan of multiple storylines and this book is no exception. The secondary story involving Rina's missing grandmother was really much more interesting than the primary story featuring Cindy. I would have loved the entire book to focus on the WW2 murder. Unfortunately there was no resolution whatsoever to this secondary plot and the resolution to the main story was very undramatic and appeared to be almost an afterthought as though the author said, ""Uh oh, I better tie this up now"". Since some of my favorite books have been by Faye Kellerman, I will still read her in the future but I certainly wouldn't recommend this one to start with."
2,Confusing hodge-podge,"I was disappointed. This book reads as if Kellerman was required to include as many controversial subjects as possible. We have an inter-racial relationship with so much sex it would sate a nympho queen; we have Jewish vs Christian issues, we have mentally challenged, Hispanic gangs, blacks, good and bad cops, medically trained immigrants, old people, even remnants from the Holocaust. Give me a break, I was exhausted trying to keep track of it all."
1,You'd Think I'd Learn,"With each Faye Kellerman novel I think, well, I enjoyed a couple -- maybe the next one will be better. No such luck. Her characters have two settings: passionate and angry. The players seethe and boil over at the slightest provocation; that is, when they're not having sex. At this point it has grown tedious. Cindy's bi-racial relationship devolves into cliche: ""the South shall rise again"" (p.443)....what year is it again? Honey, have you ever been to Atlanta?This, however, pales next to the anvil-like subtlety of Kellerman's Jewish subtext. Don't misunderstand, this flavor in her writing has produced some of the most enjoyable and informative pieces of text previously, but the whole Israeli = good, Palestinian/Arabic = terrorist thug bit is black and white thinking on a pathological level.Another reviewer suggested that this would inspire novelist wannabes to go ahead and write. I say: have at it; you probably couldn't do worse."
3,An ABRIDGED eBook!,The eBook of STREET DREAMS is Abridged!! They didnt use the Complete Book like with the Rest of the Series! It Choppy & Leaves out parts of the story line! I feel they should FIX it with the FULL story! And Delete this Abridged copy!
1,Street Dreams,This book was very bad. Nothing like prior books in the series.She needs to stick with Decker.
1,Very disappointed,"I find it difficult to believe that readers have given STREET DREAMS four and five stars. So far, I'm on page 311, most of it has been redundant and boring. If Cindy whines and repeats herself much more, I'll have to scream. I usually enjoy Faye Kellerman a lot. This time I'm tempted to simply put the book down for good. Sorry folks."
1,Politically correct drivel,"This is one bad book. I read Faye Kellerman years ago, didn't like her, but recently thought I'd try her again. Bad decision. This book is terrible for so many reasons:1. The cardboard characters: The devout and saint-like Rina and Koby (notice that the more devoted to Orthodox Judaism they are, the more saint-like Kellerman draws them); the overly-sweet father who actually calls his cop-daughter princess. The bland and saint-like half-siblings. All very boring, all very predictable.2. The heavy-handed focus on political correctness in long-winded discussions of WWII, race relations, Orthodox Judaism, and Israel. These were pure distraction that only interrupted what could have become a solid, fast-paced mystery.3. The side story about the saint-like Rina's grandmother's murder during WWII. Again, distracting, not interesting, and just plain useless.I won't buy another Faye Kellerman book. Boring! Where are today's editors?"
2,Street Dreams,"What happened to Faye Kellerman? I have been hooked on her books. This one is clearly not up to par! It's choppy, all over the place, the story line doesn't flow.... Other than the fact that the same characters were used, it almost seems like the book was written by someone else. Very disappointing!"
5,My favorite Decker-Lazarus book so far,"I am making my way through a marathon of the Decker-Lazarus series by Faye Kellerman, and (after the first book) this is my favorite so far. By now I feel on very good terms with the extended Decker clan and I almost expected an invitation to Cindy's wedding. In a break from some of the more lurid and violent endings of previous books, this book had at least four elements of a ""happy ending."" This volume also had more romance (Cindy finally meets a nice Jewish--Ethiopian Israeli--guy who adores her), some satisfying mysteries to solve, and more family details including a sub-plot concerning Rina's family history in Europe. I definitely recommend it for all loyal Faye Kellerman fans."
1,Awful dont waste your money,I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She played with it once. The CD player stopped working on the 2nd song on the 1st CD we tried. Very poorly made.
5,Great rice cooker,"I bought this rice cooker because of its timer function. The rice is now ready when we get home at night. In addition, the vapor doesn't spill to the counter like our previous $20 cooker."
5,"Yes, finally good brown rice",Love this thing. I used to hate cooking brown rice. I love doing it now! I set it up in the am before work and when I get home I have hot brown rice waiting for dinner. This is an absolute must for anyone in the working world.
4,Bought this on 11/17/07.,"I originally purchased this from Newegg, but couldn't leave a review there because it is currently deactivated from their site so I'm leaving my input here.Overall this rice cooker worked great until the inside bottom of the pan started to chip away exposing the metal underneath. I'm thinking this is the reason it's not selling anymore.I just hope using this before discovering the deterioration of the pan doesn't cause any health problems. Has anyone else out there experienced the same thing with their pan?"
3,porsche944 automotive repair manual,The manual is up to haynes usual high stansard but the photos in this book are sometimes a bit blurred and not clear.
4,"If you own one, you need this.",There are many practical solutions to nagging everyday maintenance issue. Plus I understand my car a whole lot better. Reading the book is like have a boring boffin mechanic talking to you. The information that the writer gives you is invaluable.
4,porsche manual,manual came quick and was in good shape. years of models were not as advertised so amazon gave me a full refund and i got to keep the manual! pretty sweet deal
1,Another Haynes Craptastic Waste,"Compelete strip down, yeah right. This book offers rarely more knowledge than you should already have if you own a 944. Nothing important. Everything you want to do and need specifics on are nicely pointed out as ""Too difficult for the home mechanic"". Sounds like Haynes' ""master"" mechanics are a bit to busy to make a compelete book."
3,Expensive Haynes manual,"This book is somewhat scanty in its pictures and descriptions.The paper it was printed on was newsprint.It was not really worth the money. However the most annoying aspect was the final price.$41.80 Canadian converted from $35.28 US. I did not understand why the book was shipped from the US and will not be buying any more books from you company.Just remember even in business. HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY>Sincerely,Tony Gatward."
1,"One ""Star"" is too many...","Unless you own the exact model and year (1983 944) Haynes used as the sample for this manual (and not even then, according to at least one reviewer) this book is mainly useless. That goes double if you own a turbo version of the 944, as there is not a single reference, example, or illustration of anyting specific to the turbo (and there are many) that I could find, even though Haynes claims it is covered by this edition.Robert Bentley, please, please, please bless the poor 944 owner with one of your excellent reference works... until that happens, save your money."
2,better than chilton's but needs more info,general knowledge very good but was weak on fuel system and automatic transmission information. still searching for good manual. let me know if you find one.
2,The process descriptions are perfunctory and without insight,I found this book disappointing. It offered no insights into the quirks which are specific to this car. There are many common problems which plague this model. None of these are described.
4,Underrated actor,"It is great to see Universal release more of Rock Hudson's films to dvd. And thankfully the three discs in this collection are single sided. I thoroughly enjoyed The Spiral Road - a very good drama set in and around Borneo in 1936 and which also stars Burl Ives. Both are doctors and surprised I had never heard of it until now. By the way, three of the films, including Spiral Road, are presented in their OAR of 1:85 ( widescreen )and are Anamorphic. The label on the dvd incorrectly lists Spiral Road as 2:35. If you are a fan of Rock Hudson don't hesistate to pick up a copy."
5,its the greatest,"It is so good to have five of Rock Hudson's Universal International films in one package. I only hope the studio continues the process and in the near future we will see a package containing This Earth is Mine, A Gathering of Eagles, The Desert Hawk, Seminole and Captain Lightfoot. Hey thats just a start, what about Twilight for the Gods, The Tarnished Angels and Blindfold. All Universal hits. It is a treat to watch these dvds after so many years of not having them available to watch. Quality is pretty good."
2,Dont buy if your dog is over 30lbs...,This toy is NOT virtually indestructable. We have a 70 lb lab mix who got pieces off of it literally within 5 minutes. If your dog is a chewer this is definitely not a toy you should give them.
4,Wild time boot!,"These boots certainly 'send a message' when wearing them. I just wish they were available in 3"" heels and no platform. I love what it does to guys when I do wear them! They fit well and the material stretches to fit a little so they look great. Just be careful walking on the platforms!"
1,Better have skinny legs!!,"Although they Iook great, I am quite disappointed with these boots. I was not aware of how tiny my legs needed to be in order to be able to zip these boots up. Should have sent them back, but thought I could lose enough weight before I ""needed"" to wear them..."
1,"Something old, something borrowed, now I'm blue","I was very disapointed to see that this book was just a copy of an earlier edition that someone had written & scribbled on years ago! I was expecting some very interesting recipes, but found most of them to be rather dull and basic. I purchased this book to assist me in preparatioin for a large Hawaiian themed party. I will be doing all the cooking at this gathering and had hoped to be inspired by the information....but no."
5,memorable,"This is a wonderful album, featuring some standout tracks (Eighties Fan, Anti-Western, Pen and Notebook, Happy New Year) and some memorable fillers that stick in your head mainly because of the sweet, lightly scottish-accented female vocals. Some of the horn and violin arrangements on the richer tracks are quite wonderful.By no means an essential or groundbreaking record, but its great nonetheless."
4,Fun!,"My daughter 18 months old, loves this toy. She just got it for Easter, she plays with it all the time. The only problem with it is when you have too many clips on it, it is heavy and hard to carry. We have to keep the clips down to 4 or less on the loop. This toy is not too loud either. I have found most childrens toys very loud, this one is just right."
4,Nursing Diagnosis Handbook,"I am currently learning to write Nursing Care Plans for my school, this book has been very helpful and will be one of my ""bible's"" for the remainder of my acedemic career."
3,HELPFUL BUT...,"This book was helpful (I used it in conjunction with 5 other simmilar books) but it is slightly outdated, and as with all nursing diagnosis books in general, it's arrangement and format was confusing if not confounding."
2,Get Your Own Screws...,"The clear plastic part of the wrap seems functional, but the screws included with this product are bizarrely weak. Three screws sheared off while I was trying to screw them in, even though I'd drilled pilot holes and was working slowly with a hand-held screwdriver. Getting sheared screws out of your wooden window frame is a major pain. Plus the screws were an inch long - twice what they needed to be to get the job done.Get your own screws and save yourself some hassle."
4,works great,"This product does just what it's supposed to! We did not want to put screws in our trim or walls, however, so we did buy some tacky sticky stuff to hold them on the wall. I wish it would have came with that vs. the screws."
1,NOT trimmed as pictured,"These hooves are not trimmed as shown in the picture. I even talked with a local customer service rep (of the manufacturing company) before purchasing. They have long, thin edges that break off in pieces in my dogs mouth. (I have an aussie sheep dog with a little border collie mixed in.) I don't consider this a safe or quality product and would not buy it again. You are paying for a whole lot of material that should have been trimmed off and smoothed down as indicated in the picture. I would like to find the brand that (apparently) has been discontinued. It had a red and blue label,was made in the US, and was properly trimmed. They were about 10 in a bag for under ten in the local pet store."
4,good,wish there was a better mix of black/brown hooves. the box contained mostly black hooves. Otherwise the order was as decribed
2,terrible smell,"Unless you have an outside dog, don't get these. The smell is absolutely horrible and stinks up the entire house... ugh ..."
4,My current favorite,"I love a good pen and this a good pen. The color blue black looks great - not to blue and not black. Writing I find it's a tad more comfortable with the cover off rather than on the top of the pen but it's still good when the cover is attached to the top of the pen.The feeling of this pen to paper is smooooth.If I could improve this pen I would: make it a click pen and make the screw in portion of the pen a bit more durable as I've broken a few of them as I have a nasty habit of screwing it on and off when I'm thinking. Not quite sure why you even need the screw on portion as this is a disposable pen. Also, I would add a bit of rubber in the gripping portion of the pen."
1,Product description innaccurate.,"This was described as blue/black ink. It is BLUE!! Your product descriptions need to be more accurate!!If you want to correct this problem, send me BLACK pens at no charge to me."
1,running pens,"these pens are not what I was looking for, the tip is too big and you can not write without fat lines that run into each other, unless you write in large print.Total miss Amazon"
4,Fun for children and adults,"Very good family game, especially if the grown-ups enjoy trivial pursuit. Each question offers 3 multiple choice answers. We've modified the rules somewhat: grown-ups don't get the multiple choice answers and don't get to go again. This levels the playing field and keeps the pace faster for the kids."
2,I have to corroborate the C:13:00:00 complaint,"I normally love SONY products, but I too have suffered with a2-year old SONY dvd player which now fails to be able to readDVD's, instead giving the dreaded C:13:00:00 failure, whateverthis means (I interpreted it to mean unable to read TOContents,so I was forever cleaning my disks hoping it was just dust!).I have never been unhappy with SONY elecronics before, but Icertainly am now. Stay with SONY on other stuff, but considera different brand for DVD technology."
1,NO OPTICAL DIGITAL OUTPUT!,The write up from Amazon.com specifically states there is a optical digital output from this player. THERE IS NOT. I won't even hook it up. I will be returning it to Amazon asap!
2,Glad I read your review,I have a Panasonic RV31 which is supposed to be very good. Well all of the sudden it starts giving me a no disc error or can't read this type of disc when I know the disc inserted is correct. I am very happy you reported this problem with the Sony and Panasonic models before I broke down and bought a replacement. This is the third DVD player I've had to buy. Why can't they just make products that work and last for a change? Thanks for the info. Other than the sudden not working problem that started with the Panasonic (bought it August 2001 -- no more warranty) it has done a good job.
1,Cannot recommend,"I bought one based on ZDnet reviews touting this unit's video clarity. While it did have very good video quality and sound, when I played the second brand new DVD in it I heard an intermittent chattering sound. I decided to let the movie play, but after 40 minutes the movie started skipping and breaking up. When I removed the DVD, I found it scratched beyond use. I returned the unit and got another brand. This unit could have just been an isolated lemon, but ""once bitten, twice shy""."
4,Great quality at great price,"The dvd player has been great and reliable, especially at the price. Arrived by mail quickly and in pristine condition. I would definitely recommend this product."
1,terrible product,"Hate it! - I bought my Sony DVD player about 6 months ago, worked great then out of the blue I kept getting ""cannot play"" errors. It will play music CDs or video CDs but NOT DVDs. Called the Sony help desk, they had me unplug it for 2 minutes, plug it back in, then insert a DVD - same message. Their response was that for 39.99 and shipping they would give me a replacement ""refurbished"" unit. For that price I bought a Zenith on sale."
4,The best visor I've used,"The Dongan Optivisor is the best visor I've used, and I have tried a few. The lens optics are good and provide good and clear magnification. The headset overall is sturdy and well made. The lens are intended to be switched out as needed if using different magnification lenses, which is the only drawback I have about this product. The plastic studs / clips that hold the lens in place are mediocre. They work well, but if you have a lot of movement, on and off, etc... you will probably find that the lens is constantly coming loose. If your handy you can overcome easily or even get small plastic fasteners to replace the clips."
4,A very helpful device,"I really am enjoying this vision assistance, and I use it for lots of things. I do crafts, and I especially like that I can flip it up or down and don't have to take it off until I'm finished with my project. It's a great aid for old(er) eyes!"
4,Quirky and engaging family drama,"This is a great book! I am not surprised that it won a Whitbread Prize, as it is a completely engaging tale and Kate Atkinson's writing style is lovely.The novel tells the story of Ruby Lennox, a girl growing up in York, outside London. As she narrates the tale of her own disfuctional upbringing, the story also flashes back to highlight various other members of her extended family-- her mother, her grandmother, her great aunt, etc. The whole clan has a penchant for stiff upper lips and buried secrets, and what is uncovered in this story will definitely keep you reading. Highly recommended!"
4,Great read!!!!,"This is a book that I bought on the basis of the reviews I read. Actually, if it had not been for the great reviews,I probably would not have kept reading the book. I'm very glad I did.It is the story of Ruby Lennox, from conception in 1952 through her 40th year. Through footnotes in the form of chapters she takes you back to the turn of the century and the lives of her maternal family. Her grat-grandmother, Alice, grandmother, Nell, mother, Bunty and herself. Then there are all the sisters, cousins, aunts uncles, father and so on. There is a lot of story here.It is quite rewarding to read and funny, yet as the story moves on it is quite sad and disturbing. The author has a way of pulling you in to the life of Ruby Lennox. You won't be disappointed. Give this book a chance. It was great!!!!The only complaint I have is that I wish there had been a family tree to refer to at the beginning of the book. It became confusing keeping track of everyone."
4,Touching portrayal of a dysfunctional family,"I know that some readers found it hard to jump between the different stories - but I loved it and think it was what kept me hooked. I love the theme of intergenerational emotions and events repeating themselves and the possibility of inheriting your destiny from your forebears. Having studied my family tree I often wonder about old ancestors long dead and what their hopes and dreams and loves were.I found the portrayal of George and Bunty's marriage very real and though I finished the book many months ago can recall with clarity Patricia's adolescent angst. It was with real sadness that I read about Ruby's eventual breakdown(?). She seemd to feel so unloved and with a huge lump in my throat, I wished that I could reach into the story and hug her.I also enjoyed the setting of the story in York, which now makes me want to visit it. Overall a very honest and clever story. I will now read Human Croquet and hope that Atkinson writes more."
1,don't bother,This book was chosen by my book group. It was a boring read---too many characters to keep track of presented in a confusing way. I don't need to read a book with a character graph next to me. The characters were not interesting and the story a bit odd. Save your money and time don't bother. I cannot understand all the good reviews----
4,Complex Story Told Well,"This book brings home the fact that my parents and grandparents were once young and faced decisions and problems just like I do now. It's sometimes hard to think of your elders as people with a past -- a past that led to you. I especially liked the parts about the generation that lived during WWI -- the chapter on the war was quite, quite good. I was disappointed by the last few chapters. It felt very rushed, like the author was trying to make a deadline. When I got to the chapter about Pearl, I almost gave up as that whole incident was implausible, compared to the rest of the book. Otherwise, it was a complex story told well. Some great characters (Bunty, Patricia, Gillian, Ruby) and some not so well developed but enjoyable nonetheless. I also like the chapter layout -- the diversity kept up the interest."
3,Good story but her style of writing can be very confusing.,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the story and her dark humor, Atkinson's style of writing with continual flash backs, fast forwards, the jumps to present time was like wandering through a maze. Some characters appeared early on and were not mentioned again until midway through the book leaving the reader to wonder ""who are these people""."
2,Too confusing!,"I devoured ""Case Histories"" and ran out and bought all Atkinson's books. Unfortunately, the two books on Jackson were great but this one is just too confusing. Most of the time I had no idea about whom I was reading. I was over halfway through the book before I began to understand the time shifts. It was just one big mess with a few good laughs. Glad to finish it!"
2,disjointed and depressing,"I know many people like this book -- I get that, but it fell way short of the mark for me. While Atkinson is never cheery, this was a dismal, unhappy book about dismal unhappy people and I have yet to see the point. Ruby's parents were unsympathetic, her sibs shallow and mean and Ruby herself hard to empathize with. The big secret wasnt so big, (My Pearl? Did she really need to say it over and over so we'd get it??) The back story (when not confusing) was actually more interesting but the flash back to any random year got really old, really fast."
3,not what I expected,"I was looking for a mystery novel and did not do enough research. Not only did I get the wrong book, but it turned out thatI did not like this novel. Found it slow and unexciting."
5,One of the great family sagas,"It helps to make a family tree while reading about the four generations of relatives whose lives impact Ruby's. There are patterns -- wartime affairs, sisters who support and then fail, immigration to escape family -- these patterns leaf and flower on the many branches of Ruby's all-too-human family tree. I couldn't put the book down. (It's a cliche, but it is true.)"
4,"Style, Grace and Substance","From the beginning of Ruby's story, through all the footnotes of life, to the burying of Bunty...we live four generations of the Lennox family. This is not your average family, people disappear, mothers leave families, children die in mysterious ways.For me the best of all the little stories, is Ruby getting ready to be born. Atkinsons description of being literally in the womb is priceless.Two themes seem to pervade this book...poor marriages to drunks and pregnancy out of wedlock. In the end, Ruby learns the greatest lesson of all the women in this book...you can't run away from yourself."
5,An inarticulate WOW! for this novel...,"I've found a new ""favorite"" novelist. Behind the Scenes is an enjoyable read, packed with all sorts of familial dysfunction, pathos, mystery, labyrinthine relationships, and laced with honest humor. In short, all the elements I thoroughly enjoy and which make for a marathon reading. I do recommend, however, that one have access to a British dictionary (I used the OED) to decode the Yorkshire argot and Olde English vocabulary that Atkinson occasionally and enticingly utilizes."
3,"Too dreary, too many characters","This book has received many rave reviews but I found it difficult to get into. It featured so many characters and swings back and forth in time that I couldn't keep them all straight.Told from the viewpoint of Ruby who lets the reader in on her relatives (and boy, does she have a ton of them) most intimate secrets. It's interesting but the continued time flips and the huge cast of characters keeps jolting me out of the story.I did manage to finish the book but but it remained too confusing and uninvolving a read for me to rate any higher than a 3. It just seemed to go on and on with minor peaks and valleys and lots of death and tragedy but no huge climax or surprises. None that were very surprising or shocking to me at least. Only sad and dreary."
1,What am I missing here?,"I bought this book based on the glowing recommendations. I could not even finish it. I cared nothing for the protagonist. I could not get into the story at all. Since everyone else seems to have loved it, maybe it's just me, but I sure wish I could get my money back."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I read Atkinson's latest, Case Histories, in two nights. But I'm going on six days with this one, two-thirds of the way through, and have decided to abandon it. The structure is confusing and the characters are mostly unlikeable."
1,Reading time not well spent,"This book was quite boring. Within the first few pages (when Ruby describes her own birth) hints were dropped about the ultimate ""big secret"" of the book. By the time I'd read a quarter of the book, there were so many hints it wasn't a secret any more. By the time I got to the end, I was disappointed that there wasn't anything more to the story than that. None of the characters were particularly likeable, nor were they bad enough to hate.The book was billed as ""darkly funny and satirical"" in one review. I saw no humor except for the brief slapstick physical mishaps at a wedding reception late in the book. On reflection, I gained nothing from reading this book, and got about a half-minute of laughter from that one scene. It truly was a waste of my limited reading time."
4,Marvelous family history,"There's supposed to be a deep-dark secret in Ruby's family, but the fact is that you will become so engrossed in this family, and their ancestors, that when the secret is revealed, it won't matter that much. So, if you believe that the discovery of this ""secret"" is the plot of the book, than the book is plotless - but if you believe that this is a historical account of a fictitious (but stunningly detailed) family in York, then it's a marvelous read and one that is hard to put down."
2,Why all the fuss????,"If you will allow a voice of dissent here, I almost gave up on this book several times but had heard so much about it, I kept plodding, in the hope it would get better. It didn't. It's badly structured, full of grammatical errors, has too many irrelevant characters and a fairly uninteresting plot. It seems that Atkinson had two ideas- a historical novel and a 20th century soap opera, neither of which was worthy of a full novel, so she threw them in together and came up with this. The characters were too thinly drawn for me to care about and the end of the book suddenly introduces new characters and story lines when it should be drawing to a close. A good editor would have helped - a little. If you really want to read a quality Brtish woman writer, try Rose Tremain- or anyone!"
2,Gloomy,"I don't necessarily have an aversion to sad or dark stories but I'm finding I have less and less tolerance for gloomy ones. This book was a slow and gloomy but adequate read comprised of depressing people and circumstances. For me, not a page turner."
4,wonderfully complex story of a very dysfunctional family,"(Fiction) Ruby Lennox describes the complexly woven strands of her family tapestry, beginning with her conception and onward, with flashbacks across generations. Fascinating! I struggled a bit in the first half, but I felt like it picked up. A powerful demonstration of the complex legacy of family, with the illustrative case being Ruby's particularly dysfunctional family.Potentially offensive material: several non-graphic sex scenes, some strong language"
3,"Didn't really need the ""gimmick""",I think the book would have been as good and perhaps better without the central secret that comes off as a bit of a gimmick. Also I could have used a cast of characters delineating the major characters in each of the three generations as I had to turn back to keep track of everyone. It is certainly an ambitious book and amazingly well written in parts. Maybe it was the mood I was in as I read it but a lot of the dark humor came off as depressing instead of funny to me.
1,Don't buy it . . .,"Don't buy it as the audio edition they are offering here is abridged and hacked to pieces. (Audible.com advertises that they carry an unabridged version.) In my opinion, anything abridged should carry at ""scissors"" icon to warm consumers."
2,Disappointed,"I am a real fan of Kate Atkinson - her Jackson Brodie series was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed them. I was very disappointed after trying to read Behind the Scenes at the Museum, I didn't even finish it."
3,Not so good for Persians.,"It is a nice soft brush, easy to use, but doesn't work well on gathering the shed from my Persian kitty's fur. Might work better on medium and short haired pet."
4,"Great on furniture, okay on cat","We've worn our last one out! It really gets fur off of bedspreads, sofas, and carpets. Cat loves it, though it doesn't really get fur off of her."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I have 3 cats, 2 short hair and one long. Both my short hair cats enjoy me brushing them with this which is why I give it 3 stars. My long haired cat skirms to avoid this brush from coming in contact with him. As for it collecting hair it doesn't seem to collect much at all. Never tried to use this to get hair off carpet or furniture as I just use a vacuum for that."
4,Very happy,"Everything I everything i thought it would be and more.Totally. Like, I like it alot. Am I done with this?"
2,poor product,"This pool is not durable. The rainbow will not stay up and the slide lost air immediately. The kids did not enjoy it as much as I thought they would. It does hold water even though it constantly leaks air. I can not find a hole to patch, I think it just has weak seams. This might be worth twenty bucks but not the near fifty I paid for it. It does have plugs to make it easier to drain but mine got clogged with grass so I had to dump it anyway. I would not buy this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I thought it would be a nice change from the hard round kiddie pool but it really isn't. I will keep it until it just absolutely doesn't hold water but then it will end up in the trash. I hate throwing things away but I am afraid this is just not something that can be kept and used again. :("
3,"Fun for kids, but not that durable","Got this pool for a 4 and 1 1/2 year old. They were able to play together in it b/c of the 2 sides and they enjoyed the toys and slide. However, after 2 days of play, the slide got a hole in it and now they are unable to use it. Very disappointing."
5,Fun,"My 2 year old granddaughter loves it. Not recommended for any child over 4. No air pump provided so be sure you have some alternate way of blowing it up since by-mouth is not practicle. Easy to drain or dump, just step on the side it you're in a hurry."
3,Great indoor toy,"My kids love it. I put out every winter on my basement, fill it with 350 balls and they play all winter. We have had 3 already. They last all winter but seem to get bad with few days outdoors in the summer with water. Will probably just leave it inside this year"
2,Confirmed: NO drain PLUG!!!,I purchased this product for my daughters 2nd birthday. She LOVED it once it was up. The problem was taking it down/emptying it. There is no drain plug. The other review that stated it had 2 holes is referring to the air holes. Unless you wish to deflate and inflate each time its not worth your time. A pool cover will only delay the inevitable and increase chances of bacteria with the sitting water. I'm returning it and going with the intex pool that is shaped like a star and has an inflatable bottom with a drain plug. Doesn't look as toddler/kid appealing but kids just like pools. So I hope it will work. Returning this pool has also been a hassle....Don't do it. I think your little one will be just as happy in a more practical pool...and you will too!
1,Don't bother!,"Don't bother. We purchased this unit in May 2008. After the weather warmed up in our area,(CT) we blew it up one Saturday afternoon for my then 2 year old. After a couple of hours of use, it was fine, then everything deflated on it's own. The ""Ranibow"" deflated, the ball slides on the side of the lower pool, and then eventually, the upper ring on the deeper pool. I tried blowing it all up again....and once again, it deflated. I tried finding holes...I could not. I'm only writng this review now as I just saw one of the bouncers and was thinking about purchasing. Now knowing what I went through a year ago, I will not buy another Intex item. Buyer beware."
4,Remove the slide -- mold alert!,"The slide is attached to the pool on the bottom left and bottom right side. There is a space under the slide where water can sit and get trapped. Ours became moldy. I ended up cutting the slide off the bottom of the pool (this does not affect the actual pool wall itself). This solved the mold issue AND created much more space in the shallow pool. When there is no slide, you can easily fit 6-8 toddlers in this pool. Ours lasted all summer. It kicked the bucket in late August when we had a bad storm. But it did very well the rest of the season! I plan on buying another this year!"
2,came damaged!,"was so excited to receive this product knowing its the best deal!so had it blown up but lots of parts has holes.the main part to be blown up,air cant stay.air comes out after an hour or two from blowing air."
2,fun but damaged,"fun toy but it arrived damaged--luckily the part we couldn't inflate wasn't crucial, but it's annoying--no time to replace it because our grandchildren were already here when we opened the box and inflated the pool. the part with a hole was superfluous, so definitely not worth the trouble of shipping it back. our grandson greatly enjoyed the shower and the slide."
5,my 4year old loves this!!!,Last year I bought a similar product from walmart. I believe I took it back 3 different times.. I've had this product for 3 weeks now.. it has been put to the test with all my families kids.. well worth it!!
3,one year pool,Good for one year. Too difficult to keep for next year. Lasted the summer with no problems except to empty it. Theres no way to empty it except to pick it up with water in it. Too heavy.
1,Defective,"I have to blow the pool up every 30 minutes because it was shipped with a tear in the base that blows up the entire pool. not satisfied with the quality, will be returning."
1,Defective Item,"We ordered this for our daughter and it's defected. The rainbow part is leaking air somewhere and doesn't matter how much air we blew in, it goes down in less than 5 minutes. The product itself is also very small. Much smaller than in picture. Would not recommend this at all."
5,Great product,"I can't believe people are complaining about deflation. That is what happens with rubber, to stop it exploding it contracts and expands in heat. We have had it up a month in MD heat, the hottest July on record and the rubber got very thin but no issues with it at all.Both me and daddy jump in with our little girl, we put all of her plastic balls in and she loves it. It is big, takes up her entire nursery. the wading pool is a great depth! I stepped in and it went above my waist. Bright colours and lots of fun."
3,"was fun but small, cheap, and difficult to inflate, don't expect too much","This product is very difficult to inflate, it does not come with a pump but does come with 3 (THREE!) different sizes of inflate nozzles, only one of which fitted any of the pumps I own. Took me forever to manually inflate this, and it does not stand upright like in the photo unless filled with water.I messed around with it for a whole day going and buying pumps, manually inflating things, etc and that wasn't fun at all. What was fun was that as soon as I opened the box my 2 year old grabbed the colored balls and starting playing with them. Next I inflated the rings and these were an instant success as well.By the way, I got this at walmart, one day they had a deal for $20.Bottom line, this kiddie pool is the biggest pain for parents to put together that you can possibly imagine. Once you overcome that, I guess it's alright."
1,won't last,"we bought this pool for our 2 young daughters at the end of last year, they enjoyed it during the last days of summer but I can't honestly say that the added features (ball, rings, slide) captured their attention the way I had expected it to. When we tried to inflate the pool this year one of the valves seemed to be warped in a way that prevented the cap from keeping the air from leaking out. When I called the Intex company to see if there was a possible fix for it I was quickly told that ""we don't warranty any of our products""...In my opinion this pool is a little pricey for something that needs to be considered entirely disposable. I think I'll be replacing it with a basic pool that won't cost much and therefore wont be a big deal if it only provides a few uses...."
3,Parts of this went flat within 2 hrs,"I was SOOOO excited to use this awesome pool with my 22 mo old daughter & niece. Theres alot of activities but 2 of the activities/parts went flat within 2 hrs of its first use (the part where you throw the balls thru the rings in the back & the landing for the slide) We didnt even use those parts of the pool yet so I cant figure out how it happened unless those pieces were faulty. May be a total waste of money if any more parts flatten prematurely.FYI. Ours does have drains in both pools to empty, I read another review that said they had no way to drain it."
2,Only lasted one use,Rainbow never stood up straight and hung in the way over the slide. We used it once and it entertained my 2.5 year old but after a week the entire lower half wouldn't hold any air. Can't seem to find the hole. My daughter liked the rings but didn't get the idea of a ring toss an with the rainbow bent over it didn't matter. Last Intex pool lasted all summer and was less money. This one disappoints.
5,Great buy!,"We just got the pool the shipping was super fast only took two days! I was up until 12 am trying to inflate and set up this pool with my husband and it was worth it my son had a great time playing on it!. I suggest to get a electrical pump I can't imagine doing it a different way, with the pump it took maybe 45 minute to get it done. I also purchase some more plastic balls just to add some more fun. Over all it was a great buy!"
2,Design flaws,Inflating this was brutal...especially the portion that holds the archway/shower up. Not good...it required constant attention.My toddler was happy but she would probably love any sort of kiddie pool...but this one was not very much fun for her daddy.
2,WOULD'VE LOVED IT......BUT,"My 3 yr. old son would have enjoyed this pool longer, but one major important factor this pool does not have is a drain plug for the water! As a parent, it gets so frustrating at times when purchasing various toys for your child...seems the thing either doesn't last for long or there is something wrong with it...so, as hard as it was to return this pool, we did...not having a drain plug was a major issue to us...you do have to change out the water every 3 days or so...and having that to do just doesn't justify keeping it. Good luck!"
4,Into our second summer...,"Into our second summer with this pool and haven't had any issues. The kids (4 and 3) love it. There are two large release valves that make emptying the pool very easy (other reviews listed reported otherwise). There are a number of chambers to blow up, but as long as you have a decent pump its not bad."
4,Great to keep toddlers busy,"This is a great pool for toddlers. The balls keep my 2 1/2 yr. old busy and the sprinkler is a nice option as well. Overall the pool is as durable as any other inflatable pool. I do highly recommend using an air pump to inflate it - there is a lot of blowing up required. As for the comments that other reviewers left regarding the rainbow standing up, if you fully inflate both the pool and the rainbow it will stand up pretty straight."
4,Totally fun pool,"I had about 5 three-year olds at my house and they had a total blast. It takes forever to blow up so be sure you have a pump, but the time was worth it. The squeaky bumps are a hit and the kids really enjoyed the slide. The rainbow sprinkler thing sags a bit and the ball ramp mostly gets ignored but the pool is a blast. I really recommend it for 2 to 3 years old at least."
2,Fun but no pump!,"The pool came without a pump! So we ordered a electronic one. Even with the electronic pump it took us over an hour to blow it up. The rainbow does fall towards the middle of the pool so we have something holding it. Draining is rather difficult, it stops with about 1/2 inch of water in it. Over all, fun but not worth the price."
5,Fun Pool,"My kids love this pool. So much things to do with it compared to an average baby pool. My 7 year old plays on the back pool, while my baby on the front pool, we also love the shower head, it gives us a rain sort of feel. The only hard part was blowing all the parts, but it didn't took long. It's a very good first pool for my baby."
5,Great make up case!,"Great make up case. Lots of space for make up, bottom is adjustable for any size compacts."
2,"Clever design, flimsy execution","The design is clever and versatile (no probs working in Chinese sockets), but I started having problems with it within the first week. The adjustable parts which plug into the wall broke in some way where the result was it would only work if I had it angled in a certain position. I would have to fidget with it for a few minutes to find the ""sweet spot"", and if I happened to move the cord, I would lose power immediately. Highly annoying. Not sure if all are like this or if I happened to get a defective one, but make sure you are very gentle when adjusting the pieces or plugging/un-plugging into a socket."
3,An okay receipt book,The only thing I did not like was you needed to put a piece of cardboard or something to prevent writing through the carbons to the other pages.
1,Not Actually Complete - Preview the Table of Contents!,"If you're reading this, you don't need to know that Sayers' Lord Peter Wimsey series is great. You may want to know that this edition contains the same LPW stories as LORD PETER. Unfortunately, it doesn't contain THE WIMSEY PAPERS (BEING THE WAR-TIME LETTERS AND PAPERS OF THE WIMSEY FAMILY) published in THE SPECTATOR in weekly installments in 1939 and 1940. They're mentioned in Sandoe's intro. Perhaps Harper couldn't get the rights to print them.This volume also doesn't contain THE WIMSEY FAMILY, highlights from the Wimsey family history written by C. W. Scott-Giles. Granted, it wasn't written by Sayers. However, it was published by Harper & Row and this ""complete"" edition was also published by Harper. Including THE WIMSEY FAMILY, which is OP and VHTF, would have made this edition a ""must have"" for LPW fans."
3,Good for a single reading,"These stories are 'fun' read for the first time because the gently humorous tone takes care of the thinness of the plots, non-contextual and rather silly characterisations, etc. etc. But after that, I felt like sharing Raymond Chandler's opinions regarding the so-called classical English mysteries. RECOMMENDED, but only if you are interested in so-called classic English mysteries."
4,Got lots of compliments,This did all that I wanted it to do. It played the music and made the lights dance. Next year I hope to expand the light show. I got lots of compliments from my little town:)
3,"Mr. Christmas Lights and Sounds of Christmas, Outdoor","So got this product today, plugged it inside to see if it works,(well sound wise) works well. My only question that I can't seem to find the answer to is the Dawn to Dusk setting, I currently have a dawn to dusk set up system for the lights, bought the light an sound to give it a bit extra bling this year but not sure if I will have to plug in the system I use for dawn to dusk into this system for that to work or if its built in. Time will tell. Will update later on that. Will add more stars once I know the answer."
3,Good toy but ...,"Have one, Good music, 6 recepticles, three light settings all dependent one very rare $ 5.00 125 V ~ 12 A ceramic fuse that Amazon apparently doesn't stock. Found one at Mr Christmas for $ 5.00 but the S & H was $ 35.00 apparently they follow the un-reconstructed Mr Scrooge Christmas buisness model Be that as it may if you want your toy to actually work you might want to buy one where you can also get some fuses. Mr Christmas has them, Amazon nope"
1,piece of garbage,"I bought this item 2 seasons ago. The first year it worked well. The second year, it would get stuck. Now on it's third season, it doesn't even play music. What a rip-off. The company only warranties it for 90 days, so therefore, only one season. They also don't fix them or have any suggestions as to what to do except to ""take it to a clock repair shop"". Will not do business with this company (Mr Christmas) again."
4,Fun and Easy to use....,"We're very happy so far. Works exactly as stated and was very easy to set up....just plug and go.The music sound quality is real good for what it is. Better than I expected.If there was one reason why it doesn't get that 5th star its because of the load limitation. You don't realize how quickly you'll hit it with traditional lights, so you display is limited.However, if you use LED, you can pretty much light up the block. Just something to think about before purchasing.I was a bit disappointed in Amazon for raising the price just before we purchased it, but that is my gripe with Amazon, not the product itself."
2,mr christmas light and sounds,the sound is very loud and you cann't turn it down . called the company and said i have to return it i haven't let to busy with chrismas to do it let. would of been nice if i could turn it down or turned off the music i have my thing all on timers and at 1 in the morning it is to loud.
1,"If you care about your neighbors' sanity, please don't buy.","Unless you have reason to slowly deteriorate the mental health of those living within a 10 yard radius of your property, I would petition potential customers to stick with traditional lights and decorations to showcase Christmas cheer. I'm not a scrooge, nor am I especially sensitive to noise, but my next door neighbors have had these up for the past two weeks, and my holiday enthusiasm is beginning to dwindle."
1,Quality control sadly lacking!,"Got one of these a few years ago through Costco lasted about 2 seasons then fuses blew out. Which is probably why Costco didn't stock them again. Ordered two separate units this year both didn't work and there were no easy access to fuses, required a special tool, so sent them back. Second company through amazon required me to pay postage to return. Too bad, for the computer challeged this was a nice alternative, but quality control sucks with this company."
5,Just what I wanted,"I was a little nervous buying this product due to a couple less than favorable reviews but I purchased it anyways.Simply said I'am quite happy with it.It does everything it's suppose to do.My lights are dancing,music playing with an adjustable volume[someone complained the volume wasn't adjustable].People are really enjoying seeing it and personally it gives me that feeling I had as a child growing up in Mich.and seeing all the pre-Christmas pagentry and the big build up for the greatest day of the year.In Fl.,this is sort of hard to do."
3,Great for the money but.............,"This product looks and sounds amazing. Two issues....First, the volume control does not work properly. It only works on the higher levels. If you turn it down, it shuts off completely.Second, when you switch it to steady on instead of multiplex, it pops the 15 amp breaker. Other than that, the product works great right out of the box and is simple to set up."
4,fun and entertaining,"This product is fun to watch and entertaining to the neighborhood. Although, it does not play correctly every time you turn it on. You have to turn it off then back on to slow the speed of the music down. It's overall a great piece to add to the Christmas decorations"
3,When it works - it's outstanding!,"We bought this four years ago at Costco. After setting it up for the first time, we were thrilled with the effects it provides. Neighbors and other residents of our community frequently stopped to watch, and many complemented us on our display. Our grandkids really enjoyed it.Alas, after four seasons of problem-free use, this year it developed some bugs. After initial setup, it worked fine for the first night. Then, inextricably, it quit making music. The lights still work, in fact they even flash to the music - but no music.When it works - it's great. But why do so many electronic items quit after a far too short time?Annoying, disappointing, and a questionable expenditure in my opinion.Someone needs to make these things that can last far longer. Until then, we will miss the music controlling the light show. Wonder how much longer it will control the lights?"
4,Impressive sound & light show for the $,"This was very easy to set up and inexpensive considering alternatives.The only suggestion for improvement would be to include FM Transmitter capabilities so my neighbors won't hate me after hearing Joy To The World 1,000000x AND so I can play it after 9pm and not keep the children next door awake."
4,highly recommended!,Sandy has a real angelic voice! I would highly recommend this cd not only cause of her voice but because the songs on this album are sensational. I gave this album a 4 because of the song in english which seems out of place in this album but the rest of the songs are worth it!
5,One Monday Morning and then some..,"I bought 3 of these books for my kids, now 26,23 and 17. My oldest has a daughter of his own and wanted to pass it on, but the other 2 were so excited when I sent them one too! We spent many hours reading this until it was completely torn. We memorized it and create a game that helped in times of boredom. We would do a round robin of the characters and then create exciting places describing where the little boy in the story had gone to. It was a great way to learn the days of the week and also be creative.One Monday Morning"
5,Brilliant,"A little boy sits by a window in a dreary run-down neighborhood (most likely Alphabet City in NY) and dreams of colorful characters visiting his apartment. The neighborhood looks perpetually overcast and gray, as does everything inside and out. But the boy's imaginary characters are splendidly dressed in reds, blues, and yellows, and they march in every day looking for him.""One Monday Morning"" is an old book and hard to find. But it's ironic today, because it's all about a kid's imagination. Today, with babies watching TV in their rooms, and first graders being forced to read chapter books, we don't give kids enough time to ""create."" This book was from a time before all that, when kids were left to create things from their imagination, not a computer screen.Maybe if kids were under less pressure in childhood, they would have more time to read books like these."
3,3 stars for THIS edition (not for the work itself),"I am obviously not giving 3 stars for Watchmen itself, which is both the greatest graphic novel of all time and one of the greatest literary works of the 20th century in any medium (an opinion shared by TIME Magazine literary critics). This Absolute Edition, however, doesn't make justice to its content. The paper is the same as in other editions, and the binding is very poor, getting loose upon first reading in the copy I own (5th printing). For a sample of how a REAL Absolute Edition should be like, check out Absolute Sandman (leather-bound, round spine and much superior glossy paper). Maybe the simple hardcover edition is a better value even for the serious collector."
5,Worth every pound!,"Probably the most complete book of circuits I've ever seen. While some of the components may now be obsolete, you can generally find suitable replacements. The collection is well layed out, and worth adding to the library if you like experimenting with electronics."
3,"Well, maybe","Look at the reviews, even the most favorable ones: Judy is cranky, willful, crotchety, moody, mercurial, mean, strong-willed, impatient. That angle doesn't overwhelm the books, but it certainly does strongly inform all of the action. I don't think that ruins the books for me, but it makes them less than special favorites. You might want to read the ""Look Inside"" chapter to get a feel for Judy in order to decide how keen you are on adding her to your library. I'll stick with one volume, unless there's a real clamor for more."
2,Okay,"This book is okay, it has a terrible plot though. It's basically about a creepy (my opinion) girl who makes some poster for school..."
1,A Kid and A Customer SHUT UP INSTANTLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HAHA! You two have felt my wrath. This book not only sounds like crap, but it is also very dirty. Clearly it needs heavy editing and much more detail. Wait until I get hold of you, you two IMBOSSES!!!!!!!"
4,Starring Judy Moody,"This book stars JUDY, a third grader with lots of pizzazz and ideas and frustrations galore. Somehow she manages to weather all her storms and figure out the silver linings. Of course, first she must sulk a litte and smirk alot. Gotta read this to understand! My daughter has picked this for our first mother/daughter book group. The girls plan to create collages to help explain their own moods and selfs. I think this is a good pick!"
4,This is a really funny book!,I would recommend my friend Zoey to read this book.I chose this book because its a really good and funny book!
3,"It's all right, as far as it goes","The first book in the Judy Moody series is a quick, reasonably humorous read that follows the escapades of third-grader Judy as she goes pet shopping, lectures her younger brother, Stink, about moon rocks, and even goes to the birthday party of her nemesis, Frank Who Eats Paste, all while searching for just the right stories and items for her Me Collage.The younger readers who use our library quite like this book and the ones that come after it. It doesn't have much depth, though -- even for juvenile lit., the characters are somewhat flat, and the episodes tend to lurch toward their conclusions. Kids looking for another chapter book fix will probably read this and enjoy it, but it likely won't stay in their memory when it's over."
4,Great,"Great book. I recommend reading a book about Judy's brother, Stink. One good book was stink the incredible shrinking kid."
5,I'm definitely going to read all the Judy Moody books!!!!!!,Best book ever! Its so interesting and funny! I'm 12 and I love these books! Anybody will! I totally suggest these books to any child!
5,A wonderful fusion of all styles,"This CD is a superb coming-together of so many types of music... superb drumming unlike anything else in the world, and excellent guitars as well. The drummer in fact got repetitive strain injury from drumming too much, and the guitar player has been described by Radio 1's John Peel as 'the first person who isn't a footballer that I have ever been jealous of'. Buy this CD now!"
4,May the force be with you ...,Costume is fine; size is as indicated. My daughter just loves it. Only the plastic used for the mask's eyes is not very good. You can not see very well through it; not a big issue for our little Vader :-)
3,"Decent costume, but product description incorrect","Like most kids Halloween costumes these days, this outfit probably won't last long, but it is a very nice costume. I will state that it did not come with the attached shoe covers that it states it has in the product description. My son loves this costume and will be a very happy Vader under his mask. Oh, speaking of that, I also ordered a better mask which is good because the one that came with the costume is a little cheap looking and I would call it more 1/4 than 3/4 coverage. But overall, decent for what it is intended to be. As a side note, I ordered up a size after hearing that these cosumes ran on the snug side. The large turned out to be very long on my 7 yr old, but the correct size around the waist so I will probably just hem up the pants and call it a good fit."
3,Misrepresented Description,"This costume is stated in the description as having boot covers and has them in the picture. Guess what, no boot covers. My son specifically wanted them and I was happy to see that this costume was suppose to have them. Sadly not the case and I can't find any way to complain or get the correct costume. I am very disappointed."
3,child's darth vader costume,My son loves Star Wars and collects the halloween costumes for dress up! This costume is much what you would expect from a synthetic costume. Not very roomy and runs pretty slim. My son is having alot of fun dressing up with it though!
1,Defective mask,"My son was initially thrilled to receive this costume as a present. However, he does not wear the mask. There is clear plastic for the eyes that cannot be removed. He is unable to see because the plastic distorts his vision. He could never wear the mask for Halloween because he really can't see through the plastic. I would not recommend this costume to anyone due to the defective mask."
1,Poor sizing,I ordered a size of this costume to fit my 3 year old and the company sent a size better suited for a 10 year old. I was very disappointed and had to eventually cut it up and modify it myself so that it would fit. The only useful part that did not require modifying was the mask. Thanks for the extra work and disappointment guys.
1,waste of money,"My boy use this costume and in less than 2 hr it started to ripoff the seems, do not waste your money is not good quality no hems not well done"
3,Costume,Head piece was a little small and hard to see through. Not bad overall but mostly a one time use product.
3,my little Darth Vader,"My young bloke loves Darth Vader. Even though he doesn't yet know that Darth Vader is not really the best role model!! The suit itself is great. The disappointment was the mask. Firstly the picture doesn't indicate that the mask doesn't fit over their head - though I suppose ""mask"" may suggest this. The problem with it being a mask though is that the suit may fit a 4 year old perfectly, but the mask does not, because it is obviously a one size fits all mask. This means the young bloke has to walk around with the mask propped up on his head.For the price of it, it is probably worth it (particularly at the current 50% off)."
2,super cheap and inaccurate sizing,"My seven year old son could not wait to receive this Darth Vader costume. He was so disappointed to put on the size medium (8-10) only to find it was several inches too short. As it turns out, the size 8-10 was actually ""one size"" on the tag - maybe meant for preschoolers(?). The whole costume was really cheap and the chest panel melted on low in the dryer. I would not recommend this costume."
1,My iRiver T10 purchase,"The iRiver T10 is great, but when i purchased it the description included an Arm band and Sport case. The product did not come with an Arm band or Sport case. When I contacted Amazon about this error they suggested that I contact the other seller since they were just facilitating the deal. I would not buy from this vendor again."
5,Color of player is VERY misleading,"I've just received this player but it is going back. The pictures on this site and on the iriveramerica website shows this player having a dark red color, but when I received this player, the color is in fact PINK. Just thought that whoever is looking to purchase this player have this information in mind."
4,Nice rugged product,"I've been using this product for workouts at the gym for a few months. It seems to be much more rugged than most players I've seen. However, it is a bit bulky and the built-in clip is awkward to use. The packaging is good for wearing it on your arm or belt, but I just carry it in my pocket. If you plan to wear it around your neck, consider the weight - it is heavier than some other products. Overall, I am pleased with the ease of use and the sound quality. It does the job for me, and the color display looks really cool. I agree that the color of the product is different than what I expected, but I wouldn't call it pink."
4,"Muy bueno, pero grande","El sonido del mp3 es excelente, su interfaz es buena e intuitiva, la pantalla es nítida y con lindos colores. Tiene muchas prestaciones como ser radio FM (se escucha muy bien)y grabador de voz. Es muy sólido y fuerte, y tiene un lindo diseño.La única desventaja que le encontré es que es muy grande, más que grande, es ancho, porque lleva una pila AA."
5,Pretty Sweet I Guess,This is a good mp3 player it comes with ear bud headphones which personaly i don't like but have good sound. One dropback is that you have to write all the artist info if you want it to appear on the player. On some songs the sound is alought better than others and i'm not sure why. I'm looking to buy a new one olny because this dosn't have much space 512 mb. You can perzonalize it by putting key chains or whatever on the hook on the top. it has some good extra settings and overal is good.
1,EASE OF USE,"I personally like iriver T10, because I've had one for years. The product I ordered was for my wife because of it's friendly usage and also because it used one AA battery for long playing time. However, the mp3 I ordered from you had several songs already installed and would not allow songs to be downloaded from WMA. I attribute this flaw to the possible defection of the unit. I suggest this particular mp3 in your stock not be sold until it is adequately repaired."
2,Huge.,"The product information lists the measurements for this unit, but if you are like me measurements probably don't help you much. This MP3 player is huge. One reviewer wrote that it would easily fit in his hand or pocket, well so would my cell phone and guess what they are practically the same size. Compared to some of the Sony and Samsung units this thing is a Cadillac.The sound quality is very good, but not better than my wife's Samsung, which she can easily clip to her shirt or put in her pocket. Putting this thing in my shirt pocket makes my shirt sag and putting it in my pants pocket . . .well, you get the idea."
4,Great little mp3 player!,I bought this for my husband when he gave his old iRiver to our son. The 512 MB capacity has proven to hold more that enough songs for several hours of listening pleasure and it is quite easy to download the songs to from the computer. I would recommend it to anyone. The only drawback to it is if you have large music files and need more storage capacity than this will hold. I went ahead and got the 1G for myself. But iRiver is very user-friendly!
2,"Not bad, but cuts off last 1 to 2 seconds per file.","Not a bad little player with many useful features. Memory is not expandable, but that is fine for general use. The most annoying feature though is that the last 1 to 2 seconds of each mp3 file is cut off. While listening to music, you hardly notice this, but with audio books (my main reason for purchase) it is horrible. Every 5 minutes or so you miss 3 or 4 words. So if you are listening to books, you would be better off spending your money on a player that plays the entire mp3 file.Also, while it plays back the files inside of folders in alphabetical order, it does NOT play back the folders themselves in alphabetical order. So for audio books this can be a nightmare. For example, if you labeled your folders ""Disk 01"", ""Disk 02"", etc. it will instead play them back in the order the folders were created on the mp3 player."
3,anne of green gables trivia dvd,Its OK but not what I expected and its a shame I received the dvd cover damaged.
2,My fault . . . they were too small,"I'm not saying these aren't good, they are! I needed tags for jewelry pieces, and for that purpose . . . not so much. First of all, they're very tiny. That's fine if you want tiny, I didn't mind that. However, the string is very, very thin . . so when I tried tying them on my jewelry pieces, they all got tangled together, and were hard to get off the jewelry pieces themselves. One woman wanted to wear her necklace, so when we went to cut off the tag, I couldn't do it. She almost didn't buy it!! So, just be sure the size, etc. is what you want. My fault . . . I should have paid more attention. I'm learning though!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I am astonished at the other reviews about this book. It is disappointing, lacks substance, and is too basic. Westie lovers will note that rather than capture the essence of a Westie, only one expression(if any) is used for all the pictures. As a first reader I suppose it is functional, but that's about all I can say for it. And of course all Westies are cute, so the pictures also are cute."
1,Unanswered,This is nothing more than a compilation of quotes from various religious books from various religions. For Christians the use of long discarded apocryphal New Testament era writings or false gospels is misleading. There is no conclusion that can be drawn about Heaven as so many and diverse views are presented. Save your money
1,Horrible Grammar,"It's difficult to even get through this book...there seems to be a significant grammatical error at least every 5 sentences. Bad punctuation makes it difficult to read the proper flow of a sentence. Even worse than that, frequently an incorrect word all together is used that makes no sense in the context of the sentence. There also seem to be discrepancies in the story line. Did this book ever even see an editor?"
3,Ok story,Nice simple plot. Definitely an escapist bit of brain candy. You won't learn more about the human condition but that's not why you picked the title right?
4,Different,This was a good read. It was different becuase there was defintaly role reversal here. The female was the alpha in this case. It was sweet and you fell in love with Flame.
1,sand paper,These sanding discs are really NOT very good. I got another brand at home depot they were three times the price but also about four times better. This sand paper has to switched out after about 10 minutes of sanding where as the other ones I got last almost if not more than 30 minutes!! I suggest spending the money and getting something better.
2,Watch Out for Expiration Date!!,"I recently purchased this item since these are the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I usually eat one for lunch every couple of weeks. Unfortunately, these noodle bowls arrived with an expiration date of January 2009. So now I have to eat 24 noodle bowls in the next 4 months, which averages out to 6 a month. Don't get me wrong, these are great noodles. I just don't want to have to eat them so quickly. If I had known that these were going to expire in 4 months, I would have never bought them. This is not the first grocery item I've bought from Amazon that has a close expiration date. In summary, don't buy this product unless you want to eat a lot of noodles in a short period of time..."
4,Great,Didn't get to use for what I wanted for but glad I have for the future. Plan on using it to thin out candy melts
3,zeroing in on the remote isn't easy!,The vcr is easy to set up and to program but it has a few very annoying quirks such as lining up the handheld remote in line with the receiver on the unit. The field seems very tight-can you image having to get up from your chair to direct aim the remote? The second issue is that the fast forward to play button doesn't react very quickly so you miss the beginning of the next sequence of the show.
4,Good VCR,This is a good vcr with excellent slow motion playback at the EP speed. Remote has tiny buttons but very full-featured. It is not very good at playing back homemade tapes made with other vcr's especially for pause and slow motion. Rewind to 0000 is aggravating; it bounces back and forth narrowing down to 0000 numerous times. All in all convenient features and good picture quality.
1,Terrible VCR,"I bought this VCR to match my other Sony components. I assumed that the Sony name meant something. I had two other VCRs that stopped working which didn't surprise me since they were very cheap no name brands I purchased at Walmart. I hoped that if I bought a Sony VCR it would be my last. I was very wrong. After a month and a half the VCR started ruining tapes. Note that this is long enough to be out of warranty. Sony will let you send it back to get repaired, but the cost of doing so exceeds the price of a new VCR. DO NOT PURCHASE this item. You will be sorry you did."
5,Great value.,"Bought and returned Sanyo and Panasonic VCRs before trying theSony SLV-N500. Both VCRs returned had problems with trackingtapes recorded on other machines. No tracking problems with thisSony (Ditgital Tracking). Plays every tape flawlessly (SP & EP).Super fast rewind and fastfoward. Remote is not fancy, but easyto use. Digital display on front of VCR, which are missing ona lot of VCRs in this price range."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I've had this piece of junk barely a week. It only tapes the Lifetime channel in SAP mode no matter how many time I check to confirm that everything is set for English. (I don't even speak Spanish - or anythin besides English.) I tried other VCRs with this television and everything is fine - only the Sony has this problem. BUt their Tech Support wouldn't help me and said I'd have to take it to a repair shop and pay to have it fixed. IT IS ONLY A WEEK OLD! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS JUNK, SONY SUCKS!"
1,"""Scented""? Hardly.","This candle comes with a label that says best results are achieved after burning for several hours, but even after two or three this candle's scent is barely noticeable. It does burn evenly, but when I buy a scented candle I want to experience the scent. There's also nothing even vaguely akin to the aroma of mulled cider with this one. Save your money."
1,Burns itself out,"The wick burns itself out, extinguished by its own wax. After the first burning or two, it is impossible to see the flame—for the short while before it dies out completely. Poorly constructed candle."
4,"Not indestructible, but lasts a while- One of my dog's favs","Most toys do not last a minute around my Bernese, who loves to chew. She has had this toy for about 7 months and it is around the size of a tennis ball now, most likely due to the fact that this is one of her favorite toys.I like this toy for its durability and would have given it five stars, save for its one drawback- the chewed areas become quite scratchy and does not feel good when stepped on or held by non-furry family members."
1,Fire hazard?,"While I was fortunate enough to get hold of one of the Fur Real Friends for Christmas I must say that I just experienced what I would say is a major problem.While sitting in my living room I started to smell the odor of burning plastic. After searching the room I came to realize the Fur Real Kitty was extremely hot and emitting this burnt plastic smell. I promptly shut off the toy and removed the batteries, which were very hot, almost to the point where it could burn. I find this very troubling and am concerned what could have happened if I was not there to take action. While my daughter is very upset the toy she wanted so much for Christmas is now broken, I am concerned about this thing being a fire hazard and danger to my children. I could run through several scenarios that are so disturbing they make me sick to think of, such as what could have happened if she had this thing in her bed.Will not let her play with it. Will not get a new one. It is not worth the risk."
4,Really cute and fun for an older child,"Santa brought one of these cats for each of my children, ages 10 and 6. Santa spent way too much for this very hard to find item, but the kids were really happy. It was the only must have on my daughter's list this year. My daughter's white cat is very friendly and purrs a lot. She only hisses when her tail is pulled or the area just above her tail is stroked. My son's marmalade cat is a little more tempermental. He hisses anytime he's stroked on his lower back, but he will purr if petted around his head. But then our real cats have personality differences as well. I can see where the toys could be easily broken if handled roughly, but the kids were told to treat them as gently as our real cats, so so far the toys are in good shape.And the toy cats don't eat or have to go to the vet!"
3,disappointment!,I purchased two of these for my girls for christmas. They love cats. I opened up the box and inserted 3 batteries to try one out before I put it away for christmas. The cat didn't exactly arch its back and it did nothing when I pulled it's tail. Or it reacted to the tail pulling too many seconds after. The quality of the fur and face seemed insuperior. For [this amount of money] I expected more. A real bomb of a toy as far as I am concerned. I packaged them up for return the very same day. I guess it depends what you expect. Some people love this thing.
5,MEOW,This cat is cool. I like him very much. My mum bought him for me for my 8th birthday. I named him Cat. He eats fish. I like to comb his fur. He is furry cool.
1,Disappointed,"I'm not the type that buys the ""it"" Christmas toy each year. But when I was able to find the Fur Real cat online, and it was the one thing my daughter kept asking for, I was so excited!My daughter, while 10 years old, enjoys younger toys and has a wonderful imagination. This toy disappointed both of us. The ""cat sounds"" are extremely unrealistic. With the technology they have today, there's no reason why this cat sounds the way it does - like a child pretending to be a cat! My daughter took it out of the box, put it on her lap and pet it once or twice and hasn't looked at it again since. As I said, she has a vivid imagination and still plays with dolls and non-electronic animals and can ""believe"" in them, but not this one. My 3 year old daughter isn't interested either. Save your money! (I put 3 stars for durability, but I don't really know)"
2,Hype Over Nothing,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, and I ran myself ragged trying to find it...WHAT A WASTE! On Christmas Day, the neck became dislocated (without her even doing anything wrong to it)!It runs through all the sounds at once, then gets stuck on the yowling, hissing mode for 30 seconds and then settles into a purr. No matter what you do to this toy, that's what it does. I consider this one of my biggest money wasters!"
2,Frureal Friends OK I guess,"If you cannot get the real thing, than I guess this is good substitute. Nothing is better than a real cat."
5,Great for Allergic Children,"This is a wonderful toy for children that are not allowed pets, due to allergies. Functionallity is terrific!! However, Hasbro should of distributed more to the stores. This is the 2002 Hot Toy. I am very excited to soon become the owner of this toy."
1,WASTE OF MONEY!,"I bought this toy for my 7 year old daughter. On her birthday, she was ESTACTIC about the toy...until when we were eating birthday cake later that evening. She said, ""Whats burning?"" I raced into the living room to see the stupid thing had caught on fire. Apparently, she forgot to turn it off, and it ran on its own-which its not supposed to do- and overheated. Now, we have to replace our carpet and my daughter was sad about loosing her toy. Feeling sorry, I bought another one, thinking maybe this one would work better. It didn't.It hissed on its own, and made weird noises. Not to mention, its hair was thick in some places and thin in others. My daughter disregarded it 1 hour after I gave it to her. And the store won't take it back either. Not to mention, they're expensive, so don't waste your money. As I've seen before on some of these reviews, I would probably been better getting her a real cat!"
3,Availability of merchandize,Why are you advertizing merchandize that is not available?That is not very good business practice especially on an introductory item. Take the picture off the ad if you don't have it. Substitutions won't do!
5,Broken,I was so excited to get this toy for my daughter. I have to say I am really upset because the toy already doesn't work. And my daughter is crying about it. After less than a day the toy got extremely hot it seems the motor in the toy shorted out already.
3,Less than expected,"These are cute and somewhat realistic looking, the purr is ok, the hiss not too good, the meow is loud and ok. The head movement is real looking. I think this is not capable of holding attention for very long at all.I also expected more interactive like furby."
4,cool cat,"I've never really had it,so I can't be sure completely.But fromjust looking at it I know it would be better than my grumpy oldmix cat,Soppho.It's price is o.k.,but I've seen better.I'm not a big cat fan myself,but I would say it's cute."
3,Fur Real Friends,"I received my new friend the other day. She looks very life like, especially from a few feet away. However, the meow is not very realistic, almost sounds like a human imitating a cat ""meow"". The motor noises are a bit loud, and there is no kneeding function as advertised. Also, when it ""goes to sleep"", I cannot get it to wake up as the instructions explain. I have to turn it off and then back on to get it to wake it back up.It is cute, and the sensors in it's face, back and tail do make it's head turn, purr, a small arch in the back and the tail does kind of go up and down. It also hisses and meows. If you leave it on and leave it alone, it will move hits head occasionally, meows once or twice - it shuts off in about 2 minutes after you stop touching it.For a younger child, it would be enjoyable. I would say 7 yrs and under would have fun playing with their furry friend!"
4,Great for Kids Who Have Allergies!!,"My kids have been wanting a pet for sometime now but my son is very allergic to animals. We bought this cat for my five-year old daughter and she absolutely loves it and takes care of it as if it were real. It is extremely realistic...almost spooky actually as to how realistic it is! It doesn't walk or stand but the movements of the head and back are very much like a real cat. She loves it when it purrs and meows. The best part...you don't have to feed it, keep a litter box clean, or worry about it when you go on vacation! Two thumbs up with this kitty! (Get them now while you can, though, as they are IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND IN THE STORES!!)."
3,Fur Real Cat - Beige,"This Christmas makes 2 years we've had our Fur Real Cat. It still works!! We do not leave it turned on because it isn't reliable about turning itself off and will make noises unexpectedly. Sometimes, we can't get it to come back on after it has been off for a while. We got our Fur Real Friend when they were scarce and E-Bay was tripling the prices (and people paid!) I just happened to walk into Target one day when they had 3 they were putting out (answered prayer!) Hooray for Target!! This is a decent toy for ages 9 - 12. Even though it sounds very mechanical (I hope they've improved it by now), it still freaks out our retired racing greyhound!! <br />"
2,Not worth all the hype,"I do not understand at all why this toy was the craze this Christmas. For one thing it is WAY overpriced (and we got it before the price went skyhigh). It really did not live up to expectations at all. My kids did not even play with it for an hour, I do not even know where the thing is right now. The really annoying thing was it does not have a 'sleep' mode. The toy purrs constantly. At least most interactive toys do cut off after a few minutes of no use, but not this toy. You'd have to mess with cutting it off each time. If you ask me the Fur Real Kitten is much cuter, at least that one moves its paws. I would say if it were priced at around $10-$15 it might be worth buying, but not at current prices. Don't waste your money."
3,over joyed 7 year old,"I had never heard of this toy until friday when someone brought it in for show and tell in my daughters class. She came home from school and talked about it all night. Saturday we went to Toys R Us and I asked about them and found out how wanted they were and was told good luck finding one. Sunday I went out shopping with my mom and sister at Target and to my surprise at the end of an isle A FUR FRIEND. It was a shock to me to find one just sitting there by itself. .... I took it home and my daughter was extremely happy. It works perfect, but I was a little disappointed after people had told me how great they were. I would be unhappy if I had paid full price, but my daughter loves it and that is what really matters."
2,Mother of two year old,THIS TOY DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY!! Sometimes it will not work at all or it does not do what it is supposed to. Maybe my dauthers is defective but read several other reviews with the same complaint!!!
1,Don't waste your money,"The only thing positive I can say about the FurReal cat is that it's pretty. Other than that, it's worthless. The electronics don't work properly if they bother to work at all. It's not ""huggable"" because it's as hard as a rock. It has been sitting on my 6-year-old daughters shelf collecting dust since Christmas and will end up in a summer yard sale. Don't waste your money."
2,FurReal Friends: White,"I'm twelve years old, and I have been begging for a white FurReal Friends cat since November. I talked to my grandma on the phone, who by the way lives about four hours from where I live, and she said she would send me one for Christmas if I was good. My best friend, Kendra, who gets anything she wants, told her parents she wanted one.. and the next week, she got an orange and white one! I came over to play with it, to see if it was worth my grandma buying one and shipping it over, and it wasn't! I hated the mechanical movements it's head made when it turned around, and it made this annoying hissing sound, even if we didn't pull it's tail! I told my grandma, Don't waste fifty bucks buying one and sending it across mail. She said she's coming over for Christmas.. with a real kitten! A grey striped one she named Lionel. Much better than this fake one!"
3,very fragile toy,"My daughter loves cats, Therefore what better way to give her her own than this toy if she can't have a real one, at least thats what I thought. She was sooooo excited to see this cat even when we seen that it did'nt work. She just wanted to play with it like a stuffed animal. After returning it for another one she seemed very excited to see the same toy that did new things. Too bad the cat broke that same week. The sales person warned that the toy was very fragile. I guess it would be good for an older child or a child who will really treat it as delicate as it is or else it will be broke really fast furthermore you have to send it to the company with all the information that you may throw away after the toy is opened so oftentimes youll have to buy another toy or chalk it up as a loss like we did!"
2,"Cute, not cuddly, not a thrill","I just knew my 2 year old would go nuts over this cat like she did over Furby...especially since she likes cats so much. My husband is allergic, so this was a great option for us. The #1 FRF I bought, didn't function, his head clicked a lot. Luckily, I bought 3 backups because I had read about them on these reviews. Seems the quality is pretty low. My little girl came down the steps on Christmas day, said ""Kitty! Kitty!"" and I showed her how to rub it and brush it. She liked him for about 2 minutes and went off to her old toys. A real disappointment."
2,Dead Cat Along the side of the Road would be more fun!,"This toy is a piece of junk. We bought it for our daughter and couldn't get it to work for over an hour. Now, it works sporadically. I didn't realize it came with real-cat attitude."
2,Not worth the money,"First of all my daughter wanted this cat real bad for her birthday. Called and traveled into alot of stores trying to find it but couldnt find it So I went ... and paid more than I should have and I am very dissapointed. Very hard body, ears, tail. Works so so but the hair that comes out of it, it sheds worse than a real cat. Just hold it against you and you have hair all over you. Its cute but not worth the money."
1,Waste of money!,"I bought this for my daughters birthday. My cat does have pretty good head turns, but it hisses all the time!! Even when no one is touching it. My daughter got tired of it hissing when she was petting it so she decided she wants to take it back and get something else. Pretty loud motor. I definately would recommend no one waste their money on this product!!!"
1,A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I stood in line the day after thanksgiving in the FREEZING cold so my daughter could have this toy. From the minute she opened it, it has been nothing but junk. Works when it feels like it!"
2,ZZZZZZZZZZZ,"I've tried a few times but I just can't make it thru this CD. While I'm listening to it I find myself saying out loud ""This is BORING"". The story is dull, the music is dull. I got really tired of hearing ""where is the love to shelter me?"" The drummer sounds like he's beating on garbage cans half the time. I didn't care for his singing either, it was too whiny. I didn't think there was even 1 song I'd ever care to hear again. I can't see me ever putting this CD on again. However, a couple of other people really liked it as you can see from their reviews. I think the only people this might appeal to are really young people who haven't experienced much and think this junk is meaningful. There are HUNDREDS of MUCH better CDs than this dog."
2,DOWNWARD SPIRAL FOR WASP - i.e. not a good album!,yeah well its too bad that Blackie Lawless had to go through alot of mental anguish making this album and wether its about his life or not does not mean that we (the fans) have to buy or accept any old album. The songs are lousy with little to no rythm or feel. the lyrics are a little to deep...just not wasp lyrics. The album sounds more like a heavy metal band trying to do a cover of Pink Floyds the wall. Dont buy it if you into WASP that put out Circus and last command.
5,This album is an outstanding modern day opera.,"I've been a w.a.s.p fan for years and then I heard this album. With Blackie Lawless playing everything except the drums, with his awesome voice to boot, Crimson Idol is an unforgettable story. From the thunder of Titanic Overture, to the hypnotizing vocals of the ballad Hold on to My Heart, and the conclusion of The Great Misconceptions of Me which refuses the listener to ignore his pain and heed his warnings of being famous. This album is for every metal head to listen to, since most of us can understand what he's saying about wanting to be the Crimson Idol of a million eyes."
1,Didn't work with Ubuntu Linux,"Installed ok with Ubuntu Linux 10.04 and Ndiswrapper and it would connect to the network but fail as soon as any large data transfer was attempted. In fact, it would freeze the system and necessitate a reboot (a very rare event with Linux). Item returned and replaced with an SMC2536W-AG2, which is excellent."
2,Not Very Good,"This is a sort of spoof on the modeling industry and also on murder movies, but I didn't find it all that funny. It had some good moments, but one viewing is all I ever want to have. A lot of it was just kind of stupid."
1,Dumb with a S ...,"This movie is D U M B with a S.Yeah, that didn't make sense; neither did the movie.I watched .5 HR after tearing apart the water heater.no plot ... no comedy ... no intelligence ... no T&A;See DOA instead > action & good looks & comedy"
1,Not worth the Buy,Sure Jaime Pressley looks great as usual but the plot is nearly absurd and this one is not nearly as good as her other movies. Do not sugget you buy this movie.
2,"Perhaps Worth a Read, but Out of Touch and Out of Date","The author offers some interesting perspective, but only if you are unfamiliar with online gaming and social media. This book is very out of date now (published in 2004). 6 years isn't usually too terrible for a book, but when the entire foundation of the book is based around technology, especially social media and gaming, this book lost its relevance quickly.It certainly did not help that I did not choose to read this, but rather read it to fulfill a class requirement. However, being an avid user of social media for both business and personal use and a player of online games I felt this book was terribly dated and would have only been useful to people who knew very little about the book's topic in 2004. Today this book would not educate anyone very well."
3,A stranger in a strange land.,"This is a very long scientific paper of basic observations about new and unknown world of games. Writer is uncomfortable, a stranger in a strange land.If you are looking for the big picture view of the industry and the brave foresight into the future of game world and it's effects of social structure of society - read the second book by the author ""Exodus to the Virtual World: How Online Fun Is Changing Reality."" One can question the predictions, but admire the courage to recognize the changes to come.But, if you are doing an academic research you may find lots of detailed and structured information on the game design elements and factors."
3,Nothing I didn't already know,I feel like this is a good book but wasn't an enjoyable read like I thought it would be. Having played MMO's for the last 7 years it didn't contain much I didn't already know. I gave it to my mom and she understood a lot more about why I was playing after she did so. I guess it served it's purpose.
3,"Not Perfect, Still Important","There are many aspects of Castronova's analysis, specifically his conculusions on the social implications of virtual worlds, that I am unable to entirely rally behind. Nonetheless, I think Synthetic Worlds is an important read for those interested in virtual worlds. Castronova does an outstanding job outlining the fundamental hardware, software, and business structure aspects of this industry. Moreover, Castronova applies his training in Economics to great affect, concluding that, contrary to marketing hype, all social worlds force economic decision making."
3,"Ok, Where's the flavor","I only drink Darjeeling tea, mostly as iced tea. So I am a connoisseur (ha) on black tea. This one is not as good as others I have tried. The flavor is not strong enough for me. It may be ok if you are a hot tea drinker, but it is not for iced tea drinkers. Considering the price to satisfaction ratio of this tea, I believe that it is overpriced. Sorry Second Flush."
3,Disappointing,"Having read the tepid review in the New York Times, I was anxious to decide for myself. While the framework of the plot is certainly beguiling, the story moves at such a languid pace I was anxious to read further in the hope that the story might gain some momentum. The frequent asides, and constant change of subject, is not what one expects in a novel. I often finished a paragraph wanting more. The exposition of the characters is incomplete and I fet that I didn't really get to know anyone well except for Lucia, the protagonist. Moreover, anachronistic inventions should never be used since they detract from the plausibility of the story. For instance, the reference to the use of plastic dishes in a Berlin hotel in 1943, or the reference to attempts at CPR (modern day cardiopulmonary resescitation) in London, circa 1945. All in all, a disappointing read. Other books tackling the same subject are much more gripping."
3,Get to the Point,"Michael Pye has managed to take a very interesting subject and a very charged part of world history (WWII, Nazi Germany, stolen art) and make it thoroughly boring and disinteresting. The pace of the novel is so slow that by the time he reveals pertinent aspects of the plot the reader doesn't care anymore (at least that's how I felt). This novel is inundated with sub-plots that are never developed (ie: Helen's relationship with her husband, her child, even her father Nicolas; one of the main characters) and the language eventually becomes tiresome and self-important. By the time the novel is finished you feel like you've pressed fast-forward through most of the book and don't have much to take away except fleeting images of clarity that are superceded by a mess of a plot with almost zero forward moving action. This book is at best: unsatisfactory."
2,I COULDN'T FINISH IT!!!,"I came to the local library for a good read and found ""The Pieces From Berlin"". It looked and sounded interesting, the WWII setting sounded gripping, and the plot even more so. But the book moved so slow that by the time I got half way through I was bored to tears that I could hardly keep my eyes open reading it and I decided to put the book down and find something else. A beautiful and moving story set in WWII to the present about friends and family searching for answers to their unanswered time-old questions was completely drained by Michael Pye's long, redundant, almost unecassary text. A good idea gone wrong, by the time you're ready to finish you're not even close to done. But if you're a patient, fast, thoughtful reader, then this would be a good read."
3,"This book is not a hardcover, no matter what they say!","The images are of a good quality and cover all the major projects; however, a more extensive catalog would have made me happier. The essays are a good introduction to the work even if they are typically softball.They didn't exhaust themselves in the creation of this text, which is disappointing, and it is most certainly not a hardcover which is just plain annoying."
2,Coby a pretty good waste of money . . .,"Sound quality is so poor that one has to be almost on top of the TV to hear it & to flip through the channels, you must go one at a time. I'm usually so happy with everything I purchase on this website, but have finally adopted a real dud! Please consider another product if you're seriously thinking about this one."
3,Daughter uses it as a pillow,"I got this toy free with the promotion last year. I gave it to my daughter for Christmas. She doesn't play with it a lot but she does use it as a pillow when she is watching t.v. This is a great freebie, but I wouldn't spend money on it."
2,"Well, it's big--but poorly made...","We were hoping for a lot from this little fellow. At 24 inches, this would have been the pooh bear of my five-year-old's dreams. But thanks to truly shoddy manufacturing, our Pooh came with his back seam completely unsewn. Not loose or unraveled, mind you, this poor doll's back was never touched by a needle and thread. So what promised to be a great Christmas gift turned out to be a bust. I can't complain about the price, but the construction was just terrible. Live and learn, I guess."
4,Mom Of A Spoiled Child,Wow I can't even believe amazon want's me to rate this now I think I got this when my son was 3 - 4 Y.O. he is not 12 Y.O. my son didn't beet on it it stayed together and it is what it is a stuffed animal..
3,NICE TOY BUT NOTHING TO GO CRAZY ABOUT,"ITS JUST A PLUSHY TOY...NO SOUNDS NO NOTHING, BUT THATS WHAT I EXPECTED...MAKES A GREAT PILLOW FOR THE KIDS :)"
3,CUTE AND CUDDLY,"I'm glad to have gotten this for free when purchasing a certain amount of products because I certainly wouldn't have paid [$$] for it. My daughter does like to cuddle and lay on it, he is soft and squishy but she has many a stuffed animal - like I said, it was free."
5,Great sense of humour,"A friend of mine bought this for me as a present, and initially I was unsure. As an arogant British person, I will have to say that not a lot of American humour is clever enough to make me laugh, but this was both - clever and funny.It's quite irreverent, so you'd have to like laughing at 'sick' stuff, but it's not juvenile, gross out humour. It's intelligent. The cartoons are also beautifully drawn. Mr Berry, we want more! I loved it!"
1,Where Are the Subtitles?,"The lack of English subtitles in the Mya/Ryko release of this major 1953 Italian film is shameful -- especially at a list price of $24.95. Mya is an Italian-based company producing DVDs of European films -- mostly but not entirely horror/action/sexploitation films -- for the US market. If they think American viewers are content to put up with cheesy dubbing by nonactors who sound nothing like the original performers, they are sadly mistaken, and deserve to be boycotted."
5,"Bread, Love and Dreams","This is a great cute movie, well worth watching,the actions and acting in the movie made the story a joy to watch."
3,Johnny Burnette,"Johnny Burnette's greatness lay with his recordings with the rock and roll trio he formed with his brother Dorsey and their riend Paul Burlison. Unfortunately, Johnny had to go pop to make a living and these tracks and from that period. ""You're Sixteen"" is my favorite track of his during this period."
4,nice,works great on my wind generator...a nice little gauge and great value for what i needed it for ....i even bought two of them....GARY
5,Oh those 60's!,This guy was so talented. I think he was grossly under rated in the 60's. His voice is absolutely beautiful. I would recommend Gerry and the Pacemakers to anyone who wants a real look at the 60's.
3,They sent cacti,"While I like cacti just fine, I ordered this because they were succulents, and I received basic cacti instead. Not the same thing. Oh, well."
4,Very entertaining...,"Anyone who is intrigued by the dark underbelly of Hollywood celebrity and Fame, will certainly enjoy this documentary/movie. Looking forward to seeing the subsequent film, the Six Degrees of Helter Skelter, which I'll be ordering in the near future."
2,A hard book to finish,"It been three years since Claire Hudson husband Bill was killed while they were on holiday.Now with her daughter growing and soon will be dating herself, Claire realizes that she doesn't really no much about dating herself since she meant her future husband when she was five years old. Add in the Claire's parents who have just announced that they are getting divorced and never really loved each other. Claire soon discovers dating is harder than it seems.I have to be honest when I say that I really wanted to like ""How Will I Know"" by Sheila O'Flanagan, but I really didn't. I thought that book was longer than it really needed to be to. I thought that key details about Claire's life be Bill's death coudl have be explored. I also found myself just glancing over the last 50 pages or so. And when I got to the end I was not happy with. Die-hard fans of Ms. O'Flanagan may love ""How Will I Know,"" but to me it was a okay read."
5,Won't weigh down your hair,I like this product because I have fine blonde hair and it doesn't weigh it down like regular conditioners. I don't use much - mostly on the ends of my hair and it really helps tame the frizzies!
1,Straight boredom,"I felt it lacked the ability to keep ones attention such as myself . It was countless stories of this and that, it just didn't come together for me as I thought it would . I thought it was a tutorial to learn oneself but nada......"
4,Entertaining,"This was an entertaining video but hard to learn the songs because it is not broken down for beginners so you have to re-wind it which can be frustrating. Still, I would recommend it as there arnt' that many instructional videos on the market for this type of piano playing."
5,IRIVER T10,The Iriver T10 player is just perfect. It is just what I was looking for in a player. The 1GB storage is nice. Hopefully they can expand future models to 2 GB someday.The FM feature is great. The T10 comes with a neckstrap and an armstrap. I use both. The arm strap is nice when jogging. The FM reception is far better then I expected it to be. Even when indoors it comes in nice and clear. You also have an option to record FM or voice. It even can record FM broadcasts at a set time. You don't even have to be there. The player just kicks on at the specified time and records. Nice feature!I take the T10 to sporting events and listen to the radio broadcast of the game and catch up on other scores. I have no complaints about this player. The sound is awesome even with the supplied earbuds. I use Shure E2C's which are wonderful. It is a nice investment. Well worth the money.
4,Can work with Linux,"I've been able to run the MTP-US version without WinXP using Linux (Fedora Core 4). The core functionality of the MTP protocol this player uses with Windows Media Player is actually PTP2 (Picture Transport Protocol) which ghoto2 handles quite nicely. I'm able to transfer files and create playlists using some scripts posted at misticriver.net. I've even upgraded to the latest MTP-1.54-N-ENG firmware without the ""benefit"" of a winDoze box.iRiver doesn't support Linux users - but it works pretty well with it otherwise.It's a good player:Very good audio, good user interface (browser, skip, etc)I really like the timer-based FM recording capability.(a simplistic TiVo for radio)The display is clear, very easy to read with or without light."
3,Use it for running and not much else,"When this mp3 player first came out I thought it would be really cool. I've had other iRiver models and used them until they broke (cycling). The t10 plays fine but the design turned out to be poor for me. Didn't discover that until after using it a few times. I felt navigation was awkward and design could have been better. Plus side was that battery life has been good and the model I originally purchased still performs well. It's now been relegated to an occasional player, since I now run with an iPod Touch."
2,The support on Windows XP SP2 is not available,"I bought US region T10. Now suddenly I realize that I am screwed because it is not detected by Windows XP SP2, even after following the details given in the IRiver site. I have 1.04 firmware version for this product. Withdrawing such support by IRiver is equivalent to throwing the piece in to dustbin. I have WindowsMediaPlayer10 as per their guidance. Still all in vain."
3,"Nice player, but poor support for Variable Bit Rate (VBR)","I have two, T10-1GB players. They are great in all respects, except for VBR support. This is OK if you use music ripped from CDs where you can choose the format and bit rate. However, if you download music from MSN, it comes in VBR format.Songs downloaded in VBR format have a tendency to skip in places - most annoying. If you look at the firmware history on their web site, they specifically say they have added support for VBR in firmware version 1.53. The latest version is 1.70 and it's not working.I have had a case open with iRiver for 4 months. I have not heard from them in the last two."
5,Watch out on firmware upgrading !,"The device itself is fine , FM radio reception is clear , Battery last enough , controls and soft are a little annoying . but BE CAREFUL ON UPGRADING FIRMWARE and save the original HEX file , I follow instructions and it stop working , after a couple of hours I find the solution at iriver customer service section, the procedure there was quite different . I don't know where Amazon's reseller (J&R) got its stock ."
1,Two T10s dead,Bought two of these for my kids. Initial quality was fine until thewarranty expired. Both units started failing. Units would boot up and play a song or two then make a static sound and reboot itself. iRiver support was non-exitant because the units were no longer under warranty. They would not offer any help except a reference to an expensive 3rd party repair service. Firmware reloads and formats using the iRiver firmware code did not fix the problems. Battery case cover is fragile. You'll end up needing to tape it closed.
5,Iriver T10,I was looking for the Iriver T10 quite some time. It is not made anymore today I think. Then I looked at amazone.com and there it was on the screen. I made the order at once. I have 3 mp3-players but this one is the best. The sound is excellent. Very nice design. Empty? Just replace the AA battery. Thanks very much amazone.com.best regardsB.A.
3,Not very helpful,"I found these hard to use and ended up giving up on them. It seemed to take a lot of pressure to get them to ""nip"" and they were hard to hold and handle. I used other tools for our tiling project and found that the cheap tile saw, while wet and messy to use, was able to do everything needed with a bit of patience."
3,Mosaic tile nippers,I've used this compound tile nipper for mosaics and they are great on hard tiles. So much easier on my hand and wrist than regular tile nippers. They would be even better if the jaw jutted out on one side like regular tile nippers but I still prefer these.
4,Nice tool for the price,The tool works like it should. Using a nippers is not a very elegant process so it's difficult to say whether a more expensive tool would produce better results. The grips are very comfortable and suitable for continuous use.
4,M-D Tile Nippers,"Group of mosaicists and we are all using them now - much easier on the fingers and wrists. The secret is ""little nibbles"". Looking now for curved tip. Do M-D have curved available in Australia?"
5,Perfecto,This is a very sharp tile nipper. I run my own tiles and it is a must need. Cuts them evenly. Worth every penny.
5,Great product !,Ths works good. Doesn't hurt my hand. Good for small cuts you can't do on a big cutter and for irregular cuts. You will end up breaking a few tile.
1,"bought for slate tile, and was useless. Too small for my job.",I bought this tool to use on my slate flooring job in a bathroom. The nippers were too small for this job. They were useless. Not sure what they are made for....I guess if you have paper thin tile it would work.
5,Powerful and last long,My tile cutter starts to become stunt and I use this nipper for smoothing and cut small pieces. Perfect and last through out my project
4,Right tool for the job,Helped me complete a small tile job without renting a wet saw. Just remember to take small nibbles to avoid cracking tile.
4,"Cute, adorable, soft. Not too big","Note the length to make sure it's the size you want. It's cute and is only slightly over priced, in my opinion. Is worth about $20 - $25 total if you ask me. I had a Pooh bear and wanted to get Tigger to give to my friend who was having twins. She loved them."
3,I wish I didn't buy it,This VCR seems to work perfectly except that itdoesn't play tapes that have been recorded on ourother Panasonic VCR. I just don't understand howa tape can play perfectly well on one VCR and notanother. Perhaps you know better and won't havethis problem.
3,Not quite good enough,"When you replace an ancient VCR, you expect that the new one will not respond to the index marks laid down by the earlier one. That is why the ability to search by time reference is important. This model lacks that feature. To make things worse, the time reference disappears from the screen when one does fast forward or reverse. What can the designers have been thinking?Also, there is a fuzzy band on the left side of the screen during all playback. I regret not being alert enough to spot the shortcomings in time, and return this thing for credit. Most of the competitors would have served me better."
1,The reviewers are right...,I bought this based on my last Panasonic VCR and ignored the negative reviews. Doh! Dead in 2 weeks. I'll pay to ship it back (ouch!) I think I'll try the Sharp next. The Sony reviews are as bad as for this one.
1,Quit after 4 months,Was an awesome VCR for four months then the video went out. You still get the audio and can still watch tv through it but you cant see any picture when watching a video. Worthless warranty
2,"roll on, where art thou?","By far, the living end's greatest achievement yet is 'roll on'. The s/t was an alright release, there are still a few songs i enjoy. Oh well, the living end was good while it lasted. Huge disappointment, then again, after modern artillery i was expecting it. This isn't maturing, this is degenerating"
5,"Under rated band, great CD!!","AS a follower of this band from the beginning, all I can say is that Chris and company have hit another home run with this cd. It has all the raw 80's era punk sting to it, with simply some of the best hooks out there. Try it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,Welcome to hell,This is the sound of the world falling apart. The best damn CD Skinny Puppy ever created. RIP.
4,not bad at all,"This is the first cd that got me hooked on the wonderfull paradox that is, Skinny Puppy. I really had no idea what to expect, i've only heard of the band through net-zines and such, but i was in for a total shock.I was not used to the cut and paste sampling and synth-work, but boy did i grow to love it. The first three track are killer, escpecially the Killing Game, then there are some more mediocre songs, and then comes Inquisition, an absolutely great song. Again more filler, and then Riverz End comes up, a good instrumenta;, followed by Lust Chance, a personal favorite(love the porn samples). THe last two song are again not all that great, but it's puppy, so it's mediocre is another band's best attempt."
3,Download?,"Despite classics performed in traditional Skinny Puppy manner; such as Killing Game, Love in Vein, and Inquisition, the rest of Last Rites sounds more like a Download album. Of the two Download cd's I own, Effector and Through the Eyes of Stanley Pain, I love one, Effector, and can hardly listen to the other. Half of Last Rites sounds like the other. This album is definitely a must own for Puppy fans, but contrary to one of the other reviewers opinion that this cd gives insight into Ogre, I agree vocal wise, but musically I think this is definately a look into the future path that Key would follow."
3,an irregular work,"I bought Last Rights after buying Too Dark Park; as I really love the latter, and many fans often consider these 2 to be the best Skinny albums, I first listened to Last Rights with anxiety. But I got disillusioned; The dark atmosphere created in TDP is absent here; Last Rights is not a bad album, but I think it lacks the changing beats of VIVISectVI and the darkness of TDP; there're good tracks though, 'Killing Game' is excellent and so is 'Inquisition'; but the work ends in a very irregular way, with instrumental tracks full of samples which are not bad in themselves, but stmes get too repetitive and tiring. I think that VIVISectVI and Too Dark Park are superior to Last Rights, better conceived and less irregular; However, the personal touch of Skinny Puppy is here, so Last Rights grows on you with each listening, but I think it will never beat these 2 previous albums. It anticipates somehow Download's works, mainly with the treatment of samples and instrumental atmospheres;"
4,Is my cd special?,"I think this is a great album. Very different, but thats skinny puppy! I have a cd with the 11 tracks on it. Apparently thats special. If anyone reading this can tell me why that is special, please reply to this. Otherwise its great to blast it when you're next to some escalade full of thugs. It freaks them out!"
1,When Hate begets Hate,"By his unrestrained, somewhat suspicious condemnation of his biological father (not to mention his contempt for his mother) Niklas Frank suggests only that he would have emulated his Governor General father in all he attributes to the ruler of Cracow Castle. He was 6 when the war ended and cannot possibly speak of his personal experience. Reflecting the propagandist views of postwar ""historians,"" he swallowed it all, perhaps to further his journalistic career while pleasing all enemies of the Reich. I find his interpretations of his father's diary entries typical of what twisting is done to form ""popular opinion."" I suspect that an adult N.F. would have made a fervent supporter of the Nuremberg Laws himself.In case you make my comments available to the author, please inform him that I was 14 at the end of the war and my father perished at Auschwitz in 1942. My views, therefore, are not the views of a ""revisionist."""
2,"rude, snide & not vey useful","What an awful book! I first bought the ""Irreverent Guide to Rome"" and my husband & I loved it. (He lived in Rome for 6 years & said the description were dead-on accurate). So I decided to buy the book for LA, my home town. What a mistake! Unlike the witty, cultured, perceptive guide to Rome, this book is unfunny, rude, snide, classist, name-dropping, & way off the mark. The lovely, funky, beach community of Venice is slammed for having ""weirdos, bums and scum."" A popular Indian restaurant is described as being good, but ""hold the cholera, please."" Not funny! Luckily, I also bought Lonely Planet: Los Angeles, which was much, much better."
3,A Wimpy Prophet,Saw Ken Davis in person and was far more impressed than this DVD. Almost seemed like they dug up archival performances to market after Mr. Davis became more well known.
3,Not specific to American Trees,"This book is fine, for a bonsai book, but does not have verymuch information specific to american trees. I was hoping formore specific info about native american trees that make goodbonsai plus info on how to use them as bonsai, where to findcollect or purchase them and how to care for them."
2,Bonsai with American Trees,"Title was misleading, not many American trees. Also book is not very recent and very few color pages. Book not very interesting in general."
5,Anita Renfroe Purse-onality,"This DVD was hilarious. You'll find many topics to laugh about. I particularly loved the bit about mammograms and the title segment on women's ""purse-onalities."" So refreshing to find comedy without swearing thrown in for shock value. This DVD is family-friendly. Buy it, gather a bunch of girlfriends and laugh your fool heads off!"
4,Hilarious woman,"Of all the segments, these are the best: Cruisin' with a Tan (Anita has a strange reaction to the spray-on tan before going on a cruise), Venti Mocha, and Salute to Underwire. I'm a Christian and love this comedy, but Anita breaks up the act with sentimental songs that are hard to catch on to.Other than the sentimental songs, the message is good (God wants people that are messed up and broken) and the sketches are hilarious."
5,Lot's of laughs,"Anita Renfroe is wonderful in Purse-onality. It's filled with lots of good, clean humor for women, especially those of us who are ""at that age"". I've seen it twice with various girlfriends and my mom and everyone has laughed until they cried! I like it so much I gave several copies as gifts this Christmas. I'm looking forward to inviting more of my friends over to share it with them."
3,"interesting, but not a toy","These smaller lava lamps are cheaper and fun to own, but they are definitely not a toy. They are hot to the touch and seem easy to topple. However, my 9-year old loves hers and my 7-year old REALLY wants one. As the original ones are, these are cool to look at!"
1,Totally fictional.,"The author really doen't have a clue about what she's writing. It is more a science-fiction book than anything else.Books like this do not help the cause of privacy. The real threat to our personal lives is in the uncontrolled databases that marketing companies keep of our purchasing habits, not a particular technology such as RFID.Do NOT buy this book."
5,A Great Book for Children Today!,"I just read Lucy And The Liberty Quilt and am glad that the author wrote a book for children with the theme of the September 11th attack. This book is inspirational and entertaining. Children ages 7 to 14 will be able to understand it and relate. This book is also about the power of magic and prayers. Lucy is a girl living in modern times that is challenging. Yet she relies on humor and prayers and a gift she suddenly discovers to deal with scary times. Her visits to the early colonial days to meet George Washington and Betsy Ross is a good example of how Lucy learns from history to better the future. This episode was so entertaining, I wished it was longer. Lucy and The Liberty Quilt is at once a great adventure/magical escape for the imagination, yet addresses real-life deep issues. Victoria London has created a wonderful first book for this series. I look forward to the next one. Finally, a series for children that is smart, yet entertaining."
5,Conjugal Bliss!,"I found Conjugal Bliss by John Nichols hilarious and intriging. It kept me wanting to read it every second of the day. The way the author write about the experiences that Roger and Zelda go through almost make it seem like real life. The imagery that Nichols creates is astounding, almost like watching a movie. Conjugal Bliss was probably the best book I've ever read. All in all I give conjugal Bliss a 10!"
3,Many nicely arranged songs.....,Many of the songs on this CD have been nicely arranged and are pleasant to listen to. I found that F & T favored hard playing rather than soft melodious music. Track #19 was all screwed up and does not play but just bounces around.
2,Doesn't Seal Very Well,"I bought four of these to use for protein shakes. The caps do not seal very well. You cannot transport drinks in them because the caps can easily come off. Also, when shaking my drinks they often leak out around the cap and shake all over the place. Any pressure around the outside of the cup (such as your hand when shaking the cup) will break the seal and cause leaking.Update: I am having better luck with these now after learning to not hold the sides while shaking them."
2,Shaker Bottle,"I found that the bottle isn't large enough to hold 8oz of liquid plus my one scoop of protein powder and half scoop of dextrose powder. I only need to measure out 8 ounces of liquid but I need a bigger bottle, this one is useless for me."
5,Great shaker bottle!,"I have been using this shaker bottle for over a year and 1/2. I took the advice from a review to ""not squeeze the sides while shaking"" to prevent leaks. ""Instead press down on the top and bottom of the shaker while you shake it."" This has worked perfectly for me for the powder supplement I take daily that I mix with water. It mixes in only a few seconds and it is plenty large for what I need. I'm glad I didn't spend more money on some fancy shaker bottle that really isn't necessary for me."
5,This stuff is amazing!,"A friend recommended this product, saying that it actually healed her teeth. My son and I have been using it for about 3 weeks, and already notice a difference. Our teeth are whiter, breath fresher, gums healthier. I had one tooth that was starting to feel funny, but it's fine now. I know the price might seem high, but you don't need to use much, and the results are SO worth it. It probably more than pays for itself in saved dental work. The ingredients are super healthy, so it's especially great for kids. My son loves the mint, and I love the tea tree. Give it a try and you'll be hooked, too."
5,Love this toothpaste,"I've tried many natural brands of toothpaste because I don't want to ingest more fluoride every day, and I've found this to be the best.It has a nice taste that isn't overpowering (I like the mint flavor the best).It keeps my teeth white.It froths nicely.I've been using this toothpaste for about 6 months now and I'm a fan. Try it out--I think you'll like it!"
5,"fascinating portrait of an artist, loner, dancer, free spirit, american woman","This is a lovely, fascinating, and OUTSTANDING documentary portraying Marta Beckett's development of the Amargosa Opera House...an abandoned theatre on the edge of Death Valley which she renovated, painting an audience on the walls and performing her vaudeville style ballets and skits. And then the real audience came. She was profiled in National Geographic in the 70's and is still performing. The documentary also discusses her help with saving wild burros and horses, the haunted hotel, and the local handyman who became her friend and colleague."
2,yet to find themselves,"although this album produced a couple of UK hits in there's no other way and shes so high, on the whole the album is a collection of half baked ditties that give little indication of the subtle genius that would emerge from this essex quartet. only advised for completists."
3,Before they figured out who they were,"Leisure was Blur finding their feet and it was better than competent style copping of the time. I quickly blew this album off as being disposable and had decided Blur would probably head the way of other bands riding Manchester's coattails... nowhere. So, I skipped Modern Life is Rubbish out of post Leiseure indifference, but discovered at Parklife, through my sister, that Blur was really rocketing past any accusations I could level of being pure imitators. They were writing smart songs with great music. They've pretty much outlasted any British band that I've liked in terms of staying power and importance. I think they are pretty much the closest thing to The Beatles in this sense. So, Leisure is just a childish first step into the world of britpop and by no means bad, but it's probably best to start at Modern Life is Rubbish and move on from there."
5,You can't be pimp stylee without this disk,"There are so many cool songs on this disk you'll never get tired of--and when you get laid off from your job you can walk out humming ""there's no other way...there's no other way"" or ride the subway home singing ""she's so high...""It's the best!A true must for any brit pop fan."
3,Not yet developed,as Blurs first album i dont think they developed their own style at all in this first record. still worth checking out but definately not your lovable Modern Life Is Rubbish - Great Escape Blur.
2,Lazy Songs,"Although not bad for a debut, ""Leisure"" isn`t quite a keeper either, even if has some quality moments to offer. Here, Blur still had a naive, unpersonal an not very focused sound, falling into the (mildly generic) shoegazer movement bandwagon. Many songs sound the same and the lyrics are the typical ""boy-meets-girl"", which can be cute and appealing but not particularly exciting or engaging. Some moments already show promise, though, like the dynamic and danceable ""There`s No Other Way"" or the excellent and subtle ""Sing"". However, for the most part, ""Leisure"" consists of dated britpop songs, listenable and entertaining enough yet equally vapid and ummemmorable.Recommended to die-hard fans."
1,horrible debut by a great band,"this entire recording is a piece of garbage. i used to convince myself that it wasn't so bad, because it was made by my favorite band. if you like jesus jones and emf then this is the album for you. if you're a semi-intelligent person who loves modern life, 13, parklife, etc...avoid this at all costs. i had to write this when i saw the 4 1/2 stars."
4,Good Debut from the Best British Band of the last 15 yrs,"Leisure is the debut album from Blur, the most important English rock band of the last 15 years. More creative than Oasis (hey, who isn't?) and more innovative than Radiohead (beating them to the punch in 1997 AND 1999), this album would seem to be a landmark, right? Well, no. Certainly the weakest of Blur's albums, this one still has some great cuts, like She's So High, There's No Other Way, Bad Day, Birthday, and Repetition. However, Damon Albarn had yet to discover his lyrical gift to go along with his melodic genius. The album as a whole is quite listenable in its entirety, but suffers simply from having too many producers. Definitely worthwhile checking out, but their weakest, especially compared to their later triumphs. If you live in the USA it's worth getting the UK version simply for Sing, and the American version for I Know...get 'em both!"
3,A beginning...,"Compared to the last cd Blur released, you almost can't tell it's the same band. I bought this mainly to complete my collection, I can't honestly say that I listen to it on a daily basis. But I gave it 3 stars because in its time, it was interesting, and it is a good, not great start for a great band."
3,Good but far from best,"Blur's debut is good and listenable but it's not their best. Its not a good intro to the band though and my least favorite by them. The album is worth buying just for ""She's So High"". The other songs are good but can get a little annoying. The songs are louder and rawer than most Blur material. So if you have ""Modern Life Is Rubbish"", ""Parklife"" and ""The Great Escape"" get this but if you don't, get thoese first."
4,Wonderful new view on women's life cycles,"Davis and Leonard expand the concept of the Triple Goddess into Maiden, Mother, Matriarch and Crone. Beautifully written, this book identifies phases of a woman's life and how she moves between them. A must read!!"
4,A traverse of the circle of female reality.,"In visioning the Women's Wheel, the authors have clearly emulated William Blake who said, ""I must create a system or be enslav'd by an(other) man's."" They present a framework of understanding that will inspire many women (and hopefully at least a few men) who want to make their lives more meaningful and sacred. A wise and accessible guide"
5,A phenomenal book,"I'm so glad I bought this. I had often thought about my life in the archetypes of maiden/mother/crone, but this book takes that rhythm and makes so much more of it. It's a personality theory of a woman's life, which is much different from the cycles of life traditionally identified by our culture. It's lovely."
2,I was sent the wrong product,"This was not the eoisode that I ordered. I ordered the Charlie Rose CD about Bi-Polar disorder. The wrong CD was sent, but I don't want to waste the time correcting this for the cost of the product. I will simply look for other sources. This is the first time that this has happened, but the fact that the wrong product was shupped gives me concern about the accuracy of your order system."
3,nice charms.... very slow customer service.,"I ordered two charms from pugster. I received a package with only one of the charms and the invoice for both. I attempted several times to call. Then to email. They took a long time to respond and then asked if i had looked thru the entire envelope..... yes, i did.They eventually mailed out the second charm and they are nice. It was just a headache trying to get a response from the company."
3,Interested Reader,This book is awsome we now use it to make fakes. Its always on top of every possible way to get caught. I love this book!
2,zyxel wireless adapter g302,"got this for a new dell desktop with vista that came without adapter. that was a poor idea. installation was easy and I'm not a hardware savant. but the adapter does not stay connected to my network after restarting the pc. I spoke to their help desk, who were easy to reach, but no help yet. think it's an issue with their software not completely working with vista. why would that be a surprise?"
3,WORKS DON'T WORK. MAYBE PS'S FAULT,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
3,"""You get what you Pay""","For the price I can`t complain and it does the job in a pinch, good back up bar..."
4,Great Razor,Highly recommended!! Only problem: difficult to shave around the base of the nose area on the lip due to the large head.
3,This razor just doesn't cut it,"I've been using a Merkur long-handled razor for a couple of years and really like it. Hoping that I could make it even better I decided to try this razor.Pros: Easy to clean while shaving, high quality that you expect from MerkurCons: This razor is HEAVY (4.5 oz vs 2 oz), the big gap between the blade and the bottom edge of the head make it easy to clean but I think this is contributes to more cuts and nicks than usual, the razor head is huge and extends way past the left and right sides of the blade (the non-cutting edges) which makes it difficult to trim around any kind of beard or get close to your nose or ears.I really wanted to like this razor (especially after paying almost $60) but in the end switched back to my regular Merkur. It was awkward to use because of the size and weight and no matter how I adjusted it I wound up with cuts."
5,Very good,"This paddle is extremely versatile. I had one for yrs, and a workman stole it. Home Depot was out, so bought on-line. Vendor was fine, would buy again"
1,Would it really be so hard to supply intelligible directions?,"This might be a really good product. But we will never find out. Because it comes with ""directions"" that consist only of numbers and arrows. Apparently words are at a premium, because there aren't any. The arrows leave me spinning, and my tech-savvy children can't figure the directions out either, including on such basic processes as how to set the clock function. Which makes this product, well, pretty useless. It does have that cool Nike swoosh, though, and every evening at 10:28 p.m. it will look just perfect."
3,I HATE HILLARY!,"I HATE HILLARY DUFF!WHY DO THEY EVEN HAVE A DISK ON HER! SHE IS SO STUPID! OK HATE IS A BIT STRONG BUT I REALLY, REAAALLLY DON'T LIKE HER! I LIKE HER CHARACTERS, NOT HER!"
3,"Decent, but you can do better for $20","These are pretty decent. The color if fun. My 3-y-o wanted a flip-up goggle to play ""Ghostbusters"" and we're building a mock night-vision scope around these.As a magnifier, they work pretty well. I use magnifying goggles all the time in my work because of my aging eyes. I can tell you that you can do much better for $20, though. These should sell for about $5. They don't have headband padding and the closure is a crummy slotted rubber strap that goes across the flanges on the two back bands. It has a lot of range -- goes from my 3-year-old's small head to my big man's head, but it doesn't fit as nicely as my $7 cheapo black visors (with Velcro closure) that have two flip-down sets of lenses PLUS a loupe.Velcro closure of the bands would be better. Screw-down knob on the head-adjustment bands would be better.The tensioning screws are a plus, though."
2,Not good enough quality to wear for extended periods,I bought these based on the good reviews. I do highly detailed work under a magnifying light for hours at a time. I thought these might work better but the quality is not such that I could wear them for more than 10 minutes. Made of hard plastic & did not conform well to my head. Also I found the magnifying area too small.
3,grateful,I like having these around for those moments when the print is so small I cannot read it and it is preferred over a handheld magnifying glass.
4,The Flooded Forest,This video is one of the best of National Geographic's video series. It provides a lot of information about the Amazon basin wildlife and though I have seen it many times I still enjoy watching it. It contains information on a wide assortment of creatures as well as the continuous cycle of flooding and draining the Amazon forest goes through. It talks about all sorts of strange creatures that are very exotic and beautiful. I like the way the information is presented as well as the fact that it is very scientifically accurate (I am a scientist). I also like the fact that it closes by talking about how the forest is being changed through cutting the trees and building dams on the river. It provides lots of information in a short period of time and gives a good rounded view at a land that is strange and different.
1,Read at Your Own Risk,"I actually checked this out from the library to see if I wanted to buy it. I'm glad I didn't waste my money. It's very poorly written, with choppy character and plot development. I couldn't get a feel for the main characters, as their actions and thoughts just weren't congruent. The language and tone of the story don't flow well with too much cursing, even in narration. I got halfway through and decided I couldn't take anymore; I flipped to end...unsurprisingly, she found Jesus.If you have any sort of literary or intellectual standards, then this is not the book for you. I'd recommend ""Water in a Broken Glass"" by Odessa Rose...beautiful metaphors with excellent characters. But if poor grammar and spotty development don't bother you, then go for it."
2,Don't believe the hype,"Both Chris & Gayle were dysfunctional and deranged!There was so much pain that reared from both of their childhoods that lead them to believe that life as a lesbian would be more satisfying, NOT!Chris quickly learned the games that women play are the same as men. Overall the book did entirely too much flip flopping, there were lots of spelling errors and even one instance when the author referred to the wrong character. There was drama but no excitement. Don't get me wrong, I likes me some drama but I just couldn't get deep into it. The author did a good job at building up the drama only to leave you hanging and disappointed. I really didn't care to finish the book but I'm an avid believer in your finish what you start."
3,It's Okay,"It wasn't written as well as I feel it should've been. But once I got past the first chapter it went well. Chris and Gayle are two people with very different issues, and a very difficult relationship. After I read so far, I had to see what the outcome would be. This is not a book I will keep in my personal library....I doubt if I would ever read it again."
2,Not what is says it is...,"I've previously read 3 of this author's books. I was very pleased. This one fell short for me. It was all over the place, and needs a good proofreading. Not satisfied."
3,Needs secondary character development,"The title pretty much sums up my opinion of this book. The main characters, Chris and Gayle, are well developed. But the secondary characters, and their interaction with the leads, could be a lot better. It almost seemed that the author wrote in and out the characters as she needed them."
2,NOT EASY TO UNDERSTAND,"MY DAUGHTER WANTED TO LEARN ABOUT GREEK MYTHS SO I BOUGHT HER THIS BOOK, THIS IS NOT A PRE-TEEN BOOK. HARD TO READ AND UNDERSTAND."
4,great view into great area,"This book gives you a great look into a little known, very unique area of our state. The narrator is less polished than most and this adds to the enjoyment.Totch and his family lived in a marvelous place at a time when it was really a frontier, devoid of many modern trappings and conveniences. This area is still kind of a ""throw back"" and this book shows us why."
3,Mediocre at best,These do not always light up on my child's bike. I don't think children go fast enough to make them light reliably. Not much good as a safety feature.
3,"This Is **NOT** The 80's Band ""Re-Flex""","This is **not** ""Re-Flex"". It is an electronica band called ""Reflex"". The difference is subtle in print, but this is not the band that you might be expecting. It should actually be cataloged differently. This release is not related to those who recorded ""The Politics of Dancing""."
3,Reasonably thorough aquarium handbook,"There are many species in this hanbook and they are treated in an orderly way. For the species that are contained it is a really nice handbook.But i lack many species. I was looking for some specific cichlids that was not mentioned in this handbook.The handbook has many illustrations most of which are black and white. Quality of illustrations are OK, but no more than that.To the price it is a good and comprehensive guidebook to the subject."
2,An extensive if not dry and boring reference book.,"If you decide you must have this book, make sure you get the 4th edition! I bought a 3rd edition from 1983 and despite its NEW condition got none of the pages of color photos that others rave about. The 3rd edition is on low quality paper, with only B&W photos, many of which are too dark to be of use. Additionally, because this book (regardless of edition) is in fact a reprint of the original published in 1955, it does contain lots of dated information regarding equipment and various aquarium set-up and maintenance practices.In my humble opinion....save your money despite the low prices for this huge book in good used condition and buy a more up to date book with full color illustrations and less ""intellectual"" language."
4,Good product idea,Good product idea but not exactly what I wanted. Return and credit was handled promptly and I was very pleased
4,Jennifer's Review of Simmy,"This story is about a black fish and red fish got eaten by a big tuna fish and Swimmy escaped. Then he was very lonely then one day Swimmy sow red fish and said come on and play with me. Then they said no the big fish will eat us. But Swimmy had a plan. They grouped together and make a big fish and scared\ the big fish away.The theme is work together. I now that because Swimmy and the red fish work together to make a big fish to scare the fish away. What I like about this story is when Swimmy found now friends. I would by this book. I live in Killingly, CT. I am 7 years old."
2,Not happy w/ the message,"First off, let me stress that I'm not saying that Lionni intended this. But the plot has a vaguely fascist feel that I find disturbing.Swimmy is a different colored and physically superior fish in a school of otherwise identical red fish. Swimmy is the only individual presented in the book. The other fish are an anonymous collective; they even speak as a group. The first group is massacred in the first few pages. Swimmy encounters the second group, fearful and disorganized, and takes command. They all learn to swim in regimented formation, with him as the commander, so they can scare all the big fish.The artistry is good and this is certainly a child's classic. Parents need to read this one carefully before buying it to make sure they're not accidentally sending the wrong message."
1,All the little fish get eaten in the first few pages,"Is it just me or doesn't it disturb people that all the little fish except cute little swimmy get eaten in the first few pages of the book? This book was read to my 4 year old at preschool and he had nightmares and did nothing but talk about little fish getting eaten for days. I can't even say that eating all the fish really added anything to the story. Perhaps with an older child, you can discuss the benefits of working with others to help fight off oppression, but at 4 it just seems to be a careless handling of the concept of death. Amazon rates this book 4-8, so be aware of what you are getting."
4,My Swimmy review.,"I liked the book it was pretty interesting for a little kids book. I also liked the pictures in the book they looked liked little kids paintings, they were really good! I think alot of little kids should read this book!..."
1,I didn't like how the fish are eaten at the beginning.,"I bought this book because the author is famous and it is award-winning. I don't like it at all, however, because at the beginning of the book all the little fish (except Swimmy) are eaten by a big fish. Basically they are all killed, which I thought was heavy stuff for a kid's book.I am not against the concept of death in a kid's book, but I think it should be handled very carefully. Swimmy is similar to the movie Little Nemo--the death scene is unnecessary and disturbing.I wish I hadn't bought this book."
5,"Swimmy is a fantastic, inspiring fish for all ages!","This book is a must for every child's library. There are so many topics of discussion that can be brought out with just this one book. Friendship, courage, cooperation, and the ocean life are just a few. If you are a teacher, or have young children, this book is a must.Note to teachers: I use this during my ocean unit in kindergarten. We then make an ocean mural. Every child makes a red fish and I make a black fish, which is Swimmy. We then work together to make all of our fish look like one big fish. The children love it!"
4,The Truth,"I read this book 3 times and every time I learned something new. I can honestly say that I already knew all this. I am Frankie's adopted son. I didn't know much about this buisness and when I asked he himself told me to read this book. After never understanding I understand. And I garentee you that this book is a real life and indepth look at life in the real Canadian Mob. It will tell you about the family's buisness and personal affairs. If you have ever wondered about the inner workings of a true Mafia family, this book will tell you. Nothing sugarcoated just the truth."
4,Practical & Hands On,"Just got the book and have spent about an hour with it and I am very pleased so far. First of all you don't have to buy the author's PC boards. There is ample information to create the same circuits with wire wrap. Traces are given that should allow you to make your own boards or have them made. Apendix E give tips on making your own PC boards too. Not too much rocket science there, but some. There are also examples of an HC11 controller circuit on a bread board. I was looking for a book to jump start me on building an HC11 controller and this looks like it will do the job nicely.FYI - I am not any kind of electronics guru either. I like learning by total immersion and this book appears to fit my style. I can't wait to get all the parts and get going. Later - jd"
2,the other reviews are over optimistic,"The author does provide simple and light treatment of the basics, then plunges ahead with examples of his own circuit boards.It is not clear to me if any board will function with the same programs/examples.I hope there is a better text out there."
1,68HC11,I FIND THIS BOOK USEFUL ONLY IF YOU PURCHASE THE AUTHORS CIRCUIT BOARDS; THIS LEAVES THE BUYER WITH THE DECISION TO EITHER TO BUY HIS BOARDS OR TO BUILD THEIR OWN. I FELT THIS BOOK WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THE ONES WRITTEN BY MYKE PREDKO BUT IT FELL WAY SHORT. THE 68HC11 IS A COMPLEX MICROCONTROLLER AND I FEELTHAT THIS BOOK WILL NOT DO A NOVICE JUSTICE FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT ALL PROJECTS ARE PROPRIETARY AND NOT UNIVERSAL AS THEY SHOULD BE.
1,revised opinion!,"I wrote a review after I had gone through a few chapters, and I said there were ""some"" math errors... there are at least 50 critical math errors, including errors in the tables of trig integrals you're told to memorize. Don't buy this edition!"
1,A complete and utter disappointment,"There is no excuse for the amount of errors in this book. Teaching/Learning from it is impossible because many of the examples, explanations, and answers in the back are dead wrong. I strongly urge any student seeking calculus help to use a real textbook."
2,"Nice explanations, but errors galore","It's a shame, hopefully the authors will revise this book. I would use this combined with another RELIABLE text book, or just purchase ""Calculus Made Easy""."
2,Disappointing,"I think this mini-series was disappointing considering Dario Argento directed 2 of the episodes. I only liked 1 episode which was ""Eyewitness"". I find the rest boring with no suspense or anything interesting happening. I also didn`t like the stories of the other episodes.As being said in the other reviews here, the picture quailty is nothing to brag about. If you buy this series as a Dario Argento fan, i think you will be disappointed."
4,Nice play,"This is a fine, nicely produced, digest-like introduction to pro hockey's most legendary players, the men who made the game in the 20th century. Filled with large, professional photos, brief statistical packages, and well-written summaries of each player's career, it would make a nice gift for the casual fan, as well as serve as the starting point of ""discussions"" among seasoned fans who are likely to disagree with the Hockey News' choices and rankings. / Since this is a virtual reproduction of the ""Top 50 NHL Players of All-Time"" magazine that was published by THN in Jan. 1998 -- the only additions being 14 pages covering players ranked 51-100 (with tidbit sized entries), another 10 pages covering ""future prospects"" and some more color photos -- fans who bought the magazine and feel compelled to buy this volume may try to look at the money spent on the book as less of a rip than the money spent on the magazine."
1,Top 100?,How can this book claim to be about the top players of all time when Steve Yzerman is conspicuously absent from the top 50. How many of these players have clocked up his kind of numbers ( for example: 155 points in a season ) and still continue to be a prodigious presence on the ice? Top 100? Don't make me laugh. This book lost all credibility the moment I read the contents page.
3,99 instead of 4 as #1 is absurd,"Not a bad book except for the absurdity of Gretzky being #1 in front of Orr. It seems to me the only people this would be a debate for are those who are not old enough or lucky enough to have seen Orr actually skate and play. You can't just look at numbers on a page and decide; you have to watch them in action! And anyone who has watched Orr in action wouldn't mistake Gretzky for #1. Gretzky put up AMAZING numbers, and, yes, that is part of the decision making process. But not all of it.If you had a team of 6 Orr's against 6 Gretzky's, Gretzky would have a hard time even touching the puck for the whole game. How could you EVER get the puck away from 6 Orr's? You couldn't. It would be a slaughter and then no one could mistake Gretzky as #1. But alas, to see such a match up is a fantasy!Also, I think it is a damn crime that Gretzky's number got retired from the ENTIRE N.H.L. instead of just from his team whereas Orr's number just got retired from the Bruins."
4,Little Film with Big Appeal,"I saw this little movie by accident in 1991 at the dollar theater. I thought I would be in for the most awful two hours of my life but I absolutely loved it.Over and over, this film brought out the little things that happen when a big Texas family comes together; those things you can't put your finger on but know immediately when you see it.Great performances from the whole cast--everyone nailed the often-mocked-but-hard-to-get-it-right Texas drawl.So glad this finally came out on DVD. I'll watch it whenever I get homesick."
4,Classic Del Shores,"Many of you know Del Shores from his film & television series ""Sordid Lives"". Long before that was created he wrote many plays & screenplays including ""Daddy's Dyin'...Who's Got the Will?"". This film is a peek inside a rural Texas family gathering in love & greed. Wonderful cast, beautiful production. One of my all-time favorite films."
5,Fantastic Music,"This is fantastic music, by a fantastic band. I believe they've released a full length album version of ""come and see"" which features ""love somebody yes I do"" on amazon.co.uk. Szeki Kurva CDs are also available online... do a google search for Szeki Kurva and you should be able to find 3 CDs full of insane music with a sociopolitical bent. Fighting Cocks is a little more mellow, a little better balanced, and slightly more danceable. I wish they'd put out more stuff, though. Really really fun music."
4,"Finally, a Yoga title book specifically for female practicer","I just began to practice Ashtanga yoga and there are so many Yoga related books out there, but none of them, until this one, is specifically for female practicers. It explains in detail what female Ashtanga Yoga practicers need mind during different stage of life - pregnancy, menstrual period, etc, - to adjust practice accordingly.It's very helpful for female Ashtanga yoga practicers in general.However, there's some minor typo or mis-numbered error here and there in the book, it also doesn't include second series.I strongly suggest female practicers to get this one as a second reference because in our life, there are times we need make adjustment accordingly."
4,Terrific Book,"As a therapist, I recommend this book for people dealing with anger in my daily practice. It is easy to read, and people can really open the book anywhere and get useful information. I find anyone can benefit from this book,not just for anger issues, but is helpful for anyone wanting to improve their communication."
5,cool,I think this is a cool album and comming from a teen that is pritty good since hafe of us dont evren know who she is.
2,4 the adults,"Whoa..... Hold on, am I the only kid that has this cd? I only have it cuz it was free, and I collect cds so I though, why not! This is not that great to me, I prefer female artists like Mandy Moore and Christina Aguleria as opposed to this person. I recomedd it to the older audience, like 25 and older, actually its sorta like Sheryl Crow?!?"
1,Ever heard two baboons mating?,"Well, if you haven't, listen to this recording. It would be more appropriate if this had been recorded and released by National Geographic. While the songs themselves are okay, Melissa Etheridge lacks the vocal talent to bring them to life. She howls like a wolf and screeches like a horned owl. Listening to this album makes me feel like I am watching Wild Planet on the Discovery Channel. I haven't listened to it since I ended up prying my dog, Rex, off my leg when he became so excited by Melissa's animalistic crooning."
5,Outstanding debut that showed better things to come,"Melissa Etheridge debut contains many of the greatest elements that signify a great artist on the rise. With the opening of the strongest song of the album ""I'm the only one"" she reveals the blues based, hard emotion that comes from intense longing and is unleashed upon the audience with tearing lyrics and a lightning bolt guitar. Once started this must not be stopped until the end when you are left speechless and wondering what was the truck that just hit me."
4,AWEOSOME TITLE...,I love this game. Just saw some high res videos at IGN.com and they rock!Great price as well !!
5,Great,"On game console, I generally like racing and mild multiplayer fighting (like Super Smash Brothers Melee). This game is great. As you may tire of hearing, the ""physics"" are right on -- you feel like you are really driving a car. The rumble in the controller adds some, but that could have been better. The audio is very good. When you honk your own horn, it sounds different in the open and in a tunnel. The number of tracks is great. The graphics are fast and clear.You start out taking a driving lesson. This is a worthwhile requirement. If you read the on-screen directions, it will help you in later races.The crash courses are great. You try to do as much damage in a single accident as possible. Kids love this and adults do, too!Probably will not be replace by any other race software (except Burnout 3!), even Mario Kart Double Dash (which is different enough that we will probably get that, if only because we liked Mario Kart so much)."
5,AWESOME,This game is AMAZING! The racing is awesome and the crashes look so cool. A lot of cars and levels to choose from and the surround sound is really nice.
5,Terrific a gamers paradise,Since I got the first game I've been waiting for the sequal its crashes are amazing and with anymore detail it would blow the gamecube to bits 5 stars Two thumbs and a big 10!
5,The ultimate racing game,"Hi. I don't officially own this game, but almost. They have a copy of it at the Youth Center for us to play. I don't have as much time to go there anymore, but I did during the summer. I went every day and played Burnout 2. Whenever I got the chance.Rating:on a scale of one to ten. 100. that's not a typo.It has:great crashesawesome carsunbelievable sense of speedcool ways to play,crash or race modegood graphicsI love this game. I wanted Burnout 3 for Christmas, but I don't think you can get it for a Gamecube. I think Burnout 2 is better though.In conclusion, I'd like to say a few words. GET THIS GAME!!!!!!"
4,This game is no joke.,"There is nothing childish or unbelievable about this game. They took 189 Mph cars, put them into this game and put them in huge levels with an extreme risk of crashing(which is completely realistic and actually fun). every time you play this game you will get a rush and play it with surround sound and a wheel and you will be engroosed with this game. Crash mode is so unpreccedented and will be the first thing youll want to try. with this game you will not be ignored."
5,A Great CD,"If you are looking for a CD with full orchestration this is not it. If you are looking for a CD that hi-lites Mr. Gracie's guitar mastery, musical talent, and rapport with an audience this is the CD for you. Just Mr. Gracie, his guitar, and a microphone."
1,"Horrible product, Horrible seller!","This is a very poorly made product. It's made from cheap nylon and lace. The boning is bent and sticks out awkwardly in various places. It won't lie flat no matter what you do. The underwire also sticks out and doesn't fit properly. It doesn't give the push-up effect that you see in the picture.What's worse than this product, is the fact that I returned it to the seller and have not yet received a refund!! It's been over 2 months since I returned this item and now I have to fight for my money back. I didn't want to give this seller any stars in the rating system but it wouldn't let me submit it without at least one star.Not only do I recommend not buying this product, I also recommend NEVER buying from this seller!"
4,Fair,"I bougth one but it was bigger than standar size and can't refund cause is lingerie... Nice quality, looks ok."
1,A case of mistaken identity,"This book, by Irene Carr alone, is not the same as the book THE LOVE CHILD from the Daughters of England series by Philippa Carr. The previous reviewers are describing the plot of the Philippa Carr book and not the Irene Carr book by the same title. This mixup should be corrected. I have given a one-star rating only because Amazon forces a rating and I have not even read the book."
3,Pretty good charger,"The first one I got didn't work well because the USB cable had a short in it. The replacement seems to work fine, but the overall quality is not as good as the Apple charger."
3,Pretty good for the price,"I bought several of these and they basically work well. They are nice and compact and certainly do the job. They have a green light on them that turns red when the iPod is plugged in. On some of them the light would stay green when you attached the iPod and never turn red. I don't know if this is indicative of a problem, but they seemed to keep charging even when it was still green.If I only needed one for home I might buy something better. A much better one is only going to cost a few bucks more. But for casual use these are probably fine."
3,This is an ok charger but doesn't work with my nano,"This is an ok charger but doesn't work with my nano! However, it does work with my moms mp3 player.."
4,"Good, solid Ipod charger",This charger is useful when I don't want to connect my Ipod to the computer for charging. Good performance
5,Big-Don's Review of a Shakespeare Classic,"I must say that this is my favorite of Shakespeare's works. I was drawn to the love story contained wherein. It has a touch of romance, mystery, and comedy! It is appropriate for anyone looking for a good book! It get's the Big-D seal of approval."
4,A family comedy play,"An excellent piece of romantic comedy for all lovers regardless of age.A piece of work done by William Shakespeare that could be viewed by the whole family and almost anyone.The performance acted by the craftsmen ""Pyramus&Thsbe"" is similar to the romantic tradegy production Romeo & Juliet.A Midsunner night's Dream tells us of 2 star-crossed lover whose obsticles are Egeus(Hermia's father), Demetrius(Hermia's lover) and the Athenian's law imposed by Theseus(Duke of Athens)The lover's Lysander&Hermia are added with more complications by the fairy world.when Puck mistakenly placed the love-potion onto the eyes of Lysander instead of Demetrius.This stikes a love triangle between Lysander,Demetrius and Helena.Whatsoever,the play ended happily and is compromised by the comedic performance of the craftsmen.A piece of work that should be view and read by people of all ages and race."
5,My buddy loves it!,"I know it's pretty pricey, but I was hoping for some longevity out of this item which is why I invested in it. Lo and behold, Duncan loves it! We recently moved to a new place, which is when I got the new bed and he likes it so much he stopped sleeping in the bed with me (something the bf is VERY happy about). Give the dog a treat, and he takes it right to his bed!It also seems to be made out of pretty durable material. I have a 65 lb. German Shepherd mix/mutt and it has held up just fine, although Duncan is not destructive. Also, the 40 inch size seems to fit him just right (maybe even a little big)!"
2,Was very dissappointed,"I was really disappointed with this purchase, there was very little filling for comfort. Our 75-80 pound lab was essentially on the floor. I was thinking of cutting it open and adding a couple of layers of memory foam at the bottom (I'm sure this would have helped immensely) but ended up giving it away to a friend. The bolster was much firmer and better compacted than the base of the bed."
2,Keeping it clean,My 17 year-old Cockapoo finds the bed most comfortable. It's large enough for her to turn around in it the mandatory 3-6 times before settling in with her head slung over the side. The bed is not easy to wash. It is too large and bulky to fit into my large capacity washer and my extra large dryer. It is necessary to haul the bed off to the local laundramat and use the commercial machines with the highest capacity. Not fun. Not convenient. Worth it only because I love my dog but I've told her it's getting old. Do not buy the large Bagel Donut Dog Bed unless you live right next door to the laundramat and have an endless supply of quarters.
4,Most Comfortable Bed Ever,This bed is awesome!! It is so comfortable and my dog loves it! You only downside is you have to put the whole bed in the laundry machine
3,seems durable,My border terrier has never liked to sleep in dog beds. She always try to jump into our bed and sleep. The bed is very soft and supportive as well as seems durable. Now I have to train her to sleep on this dog bed.
4,It was just so funny!,"This is the coolest, most comfortable, stain-resisting doggy bed. I absolutely loved it, the merchant is great - my goofy little Sheltie fell right out on his - um,- back and wouldn't get back in. Not for nuttin'.I had to return it, and I have been very reproachful of my little klutzy dog about having to buy thin, flat, fake sheepskin beds for him. It makes me feel like a bad mommy because the floor's hard and it's cold. Or if you're being all adult here, a poor excuse for a pet owner."
3,Dog bed,"It's a stanard bed. Really ""fluffy"" when new. Broke down faster than I think it should have after use and washings. Nothing impressive but not bad either."
5,Plenty of room,"My 70 pounder has plenty of room, actually too much! The bed bottom is very lofty. Sides are high. I was pleased. Although, I am thinking I should have gotten the smaller size since he wants to curl up in a ball in the winter time. I was hoping his new bed would deter him from wanting to sleep on the couch, but it hasn't."
5,Oscar loves it!,"I have a shepherd/chow mix about 40-45 lbs and the large size bed is perfect for him. He can snuggle up with the bolster, all curled up, or can stretch out comfortably on his back. He loves the bed and spends more time in it than his last bed, but he hasn't given up MY bed for it, like another reviewer wrote! He was a little unsure at first, b/c he's never had a bed with sides, but he took to it pretty quickly. One reviewer wrote that their dog fell out. The sides can tilt a bit, but my dog loves it...it's like a big pillow. Haven't washed it yet. I highly recommend this bed!"
3,"Small 24"" Bagel Domut Dog Cat Bed","I have a Min-Pin and a Miniture Schnauzer and the bed was bearly big enough for them, but they fit. What mades it bad is that when they lay in it, it tends to roll over. Funny to watch but hard to sleep in."
4,"Nice pet bed, but padding could be a little better.","I purchased this medium pet bed for my smaller dog, and the larger model for my larger dog. In my opinion, the medium model is much more fluffy than the large model. My dog, still uses the large model (she is about 35 pounds, and fits in it comfortably) but its stuffing doesn't look like the picture viewed here, it's a lot thinner."
3,comfy for pups big and small,"I love this thing and so does my 17 pound mutt. He took it over from my 65 pound mutt for which I bought this bed. I only gave it 3 stars because you have to take it a laundromat in order to wash it. This bed is so big, to have to lug it out of the house is cumbersome and inconvenient. It would be so much easier if you could take it apart and just wash it at home."
1,Bagel Bed Much Too Small,"This 40"" Bagel Donut Dog Pet Bed is advertised for dogs that are 45 - 70 lbs. Our shepherd-mix dog, who weighs 55 lbs, could could not stretch out at all in this bed. The only way she would have been able to use it would be to curl up the entire time. After calling the company, I received a terse email that stated I would need to ship the bed back at my cost, receive no shipping reimbursement, and that if there were any evidence that the dog had even tried the bed, they would return the bed to me at my expense."
1,puff daddy,"i am disappointed with this product. Too expensive and clearly designed for ease of production and not for your animal.The filler is all center mass. The sowing that holds the filler is sewn in at the base. So one matter that size dog, the dog will be laying on a lump. Other positive reviews I saw must have been written by the vendor."
1,TERRIBLE service. company is run by a complete (insert nasty word),"First off, the bed is GREAT. my dog loves it. it's just a shame it's only available from this company. I ordered the wrong size okay my mistake and tried to contact the company to go about the return process. took forever to get through to the company, don't even BOTHER emailing because they sure as hell don't bother emailing back. I called again and finally a response. it costs me a fortune to mail the bed back for return. I wait for a solid week til after the tracking conf says they received to give them a call with a 'hey whats up with the status of my refund' . well no response. i tried a few more times and then finally a response. a NASTY email from this Elena Peters person. well i'm still waiting for a refund to show up somewhere. maybe a more detailed explanation other than:""You'vehaditsinceMay17th.""would be appropriate. anywho. if you buy the bed and encounter a problem with it, BEWARE the (insert nasty word)s who work there."
4,Great Bed for Big Dogs!,"My dog loves this bed! I have a Labradoodle thats 50lbs and I bought the 52""bed. After reading some of the other reviews, I measured the length of my dog vs. going by her weight and factored in that she loves the sleep with our legs stretched out. I figured the larger bed would give her plenty of room so she wouldnt have to curl up. Im so glad I got the bigger size because the actual inside of the bed really didnt seem that big once I saw my dog in it. She has just enough space, so it also really depends on how your dog sleeps. I would have gave this bed 5 stars if the middle wasnt so clumpy. It has a nice soft fabric but the stuffing is bunched up in spots...however, my dog really doesnt seem to care. The exterior (bumper around the bed) seems to be great quality and holds the shape nicely. Overall, my doodle is very satisfied!"
5,How do dogs know what's theirs?,"I purchased the 24"" in red for my Maltese and as soon as it was unwrapped and placed on the floor - blap - he was in it. He's 6'13"" and it's a cozy fit for him, but then he likes cozy. He uses the rim as a chin rest to watch me.It's very soft and lightweight, the kind of bed you'll find yourself picking up and taking from room to room so your pet can be with you without being on you. That's what I do, anyway. Just throw it wherever because it's not going to damage anything.Excellent quality. Nice material, soft stuffing. It just begs to be jumped into."
4,Comfortable bed for Izzy,"After Izzy shredded her last bed I wanted to find a bed that was less fuzzy. I liked the high sides, Izzy likes to hang her head up and over the sides of things, and the oval shape. The color is very nice and the bed large. Even though Izzy is only a 14 lb mini schnauzer she likes to lay stretched out.When we first unpacked the bed the bottom was curved and the bed rocked like the foot of a rocking chair. I was concerned it would bother Izzy, but she jumped right in and made herself at home. She likes tucking herself in the crevices between the sides and bottom. The stuffing is very nice, very fluffy and the construction seems soft but durable.*edited 10/23/12Update- despite daily wiggling, happy dancing on her back, digging in her bed, this bed continues to be great. I have tossed it in the washer and dryer and it's really holding up. The bottom continues to be fluffy, the sides are still firm and the sherpa covering still looks very good."
2,"lumpy, seam tore quickly","It started out good looking. but the seam tore quickly under my dogs scratching, and it lumped up as well- should have read the reviews better- no zip off cover. It got dirty real fast as the fuzzy inside liner (not really true sherpa, thin and flat) was white and shows dirt and hair. After a week- it does not look so hot unless I put an extra blanket in the center. Will be buying a different bed in the future and likely not online. Should have sent it back but shipping was too expensive."
5,my dogs love these beds,"I wrote a review for the 40"" bed, as I have that one, and the 32"". My dogs absolutely love these beds. Even tho its too small for her, my 60lb dog squeezes into the little bed, they love snuggling into these. My cat even lays in the smaller bed, instead of laying on my bed which is right next to these beds. The cat will probably get her own small bagel bed."
4,STILL SMOKIN,"The Players within a span of 3 years transformed themselves from a rock-funk outfit to a smoldering semi-jazz influcenced funk outfit. Either way the music was just as powerful. Where as ""Fire"" just burned with pure white hot rock-funk, this one smolders with sweaty down deep funk that sticks in your head. Even thier singles were smoother at this point (The funky ""Who'd She Coo?""). Hot Ballds like ""Precious Love, Little Lady Maria, and Tell the Truth"" still sound fresh today and Give it up to the Players for keeping it fresh regardless of record sales."
4,"At their peak, this band was still creating an' re-creating.","I don't think 'Contradiction' is their best album like some, but it was their last effort of true funk, before the disco scene an' their drum machines an' strobes took over the scene. Focused on slow and sultry grooves, an obvious extention of their 'Honey', is' obvious the Players' were tryin' to create art an' strivin' to please. Just take one listen to the slinky groove of 'Precious Love' or Leroy Bonner's agile baritone on the sweet, dripping ballad 'My Life' and tell me I'm wrong. These guys were the best at what they did; excellent harmony arrangements, rolling rhythms an' background vocals, e'ything performed to near-perfection. There are random social messages here an' there, but still wit' tha funky chicken-scratch guitars and horn-powered grooves."
3,Seventies Super Group,"First signs of decline for one of the Tightest Bands of the Seventies. The cover was a Masterpiece as were the others, but this Lp only produced one super-smash ""Who'd She Coo?"" (which is a funk Classic). An alumni of the Class of '76. The rest of the material on the Lp is mediocre at best. Save your money. Buy ""Skin Tight"",""Fire"" & ""Honey"" first"
5,Great entertainment,"Just love his messages... I listen constantly, so glad I found him. not much more to say, just love is messages."
5,Great book!,This book is great for personal or classroom in learning how to grow in the likeness of our Lord Jesus Christ. It has powerful charts and very nicely done!
5,Excellent Book on The Falaise Gap,"What a good book! I enjoyed ""Tug of War"" by the author and ""Falaise"" was even better. The author gives us the first person view from American, British, Canadian, Polish, French and German participants. The author goes from the soldier in the slit trench to the rooms where strategic decisions are made. The book pulls no punches in its critical view of allied decision making. The story flows very well, and is a quick read."
4,Great 5.1 mix,"Having just received this DTS mix I have to say it's one of the better surround sound remixes I have heard. I have this on vinyl and I remember liking the album for the most part, and this stellar mix is a prime example of how a 5.1 music mix should be. The only observation is, and it's just that, an observation, is the back surrounds can be a tad shrill on the higher notes at times. Not really bad considering how old the original recording is. The bass is about as good as you can get, not overdone and boomy like alot of todays music. Even though there is a song or two I don't really care for on this album, it's still a great one to have in the inventory."
3,A heavy funk-rock mofo from 1975,"""Fire"" is loosely themed around smoke and fire, and incorporates a lot more guitar than other albums. ""I Want To Be Free"" and ""What The Hell"" are the strongest cuts on this album, with blast-a** backup vocals. A must-buy for Ohio Players' fans."
1,Depressing,"While well written, this is one of the most depressing books I have ever read. It feels as if the author tries to outdo herself with telling one evil and defiling event after another. Perhaps it was the title which misled me. Or a review what refers to ""the many faces and languages of grace"" and ""a feast of holiness.""I am glad others enjoyed it. But for me, while I have no doubt that the events described have happened to people, and still do, to have them happen over and over in 240 pages is not at all balanced by a 6 page epilogue of understanding and release."
2,Not enough sendmail material,"The book was ok for a very basic overview of sendmail, but it spent far too much time explaining basic Linux. If you are configuring sendmail, you probably already have a working knowledge of Linux.I would have liked this book to have spent more time discussing configuring sendmail, I didn't find it very helpful at all."
2,It's not sendmail book. It's just miscelleneous linux,"Instead of writing book about sendmail, author uses half of the book to explain material NOT related to sendmail per se. SENDMAIL.CF is the most refractory config file in the world ... which also makes sendmail the best mail router in the world too. People always asks for help about it. But the author writes about it in .. well, less than 20 pages. There's no talking about filters, no spam prevention, no nothing. What in the world does PPP have with sendmail -- than a chapter has to be dedicated to it?Conclusion: Nothing much in it could help you survive editing sendmail.cf"
2,Misleading Title :-(,"Bad Book for Sendmail. Almost nothing about Sendmail in here. Good intro info about everything else though. (Email Principles, Linux as a mail server, Communication & Network info, DNS, SMPT, POP3, IMAP, PPP, UUCP). I feel like I wasted my money."
4,Good book for administrators of small Linux systems.,The author is skilled at presenting underlyingprinciples accurately and with a minimum of jargon.He combines a clear treatment of general principleswith many examples demonstrating how to configure mailin many different settings. The examples will be especially useful in small organizations or businesses.
2,Delayed Allergic Reaction. . .,"I bought this product 2 weeks ago. I started using it and loved it! The smell was nice and it was all natural. A few days ago, I noticed a rash starting right at the end of my armpit. It was accompanied with hot and burning in my armpits. My skin is sensitive, but I didn't think it was that sensitive. . ."
2,Seems to be a different product?,"I'm really not sure if this is the same product. It does not look like the one advertised or the one I've used in the past. This one was blue. I'm not sure if it's just updated packaging? Unfortunately, it also doesn't seem to work as well."
2,Disappointed,"This stuff doesn't work for me. I think mine says 24 hour protection, but it doesn't last even a few hours. Also, I found that if I get dressed right after I put it on it leaves wet marks that show through my shirt. It makes it look like I have sweaty pits. So now I have to wait a little while before I finish getting dressed, wipe my armpits with some tissue, and then put a shirt on. I don't want to throw the whole thing out as it was over 4 bucks, but this stuff just does not work. It smells nice, but that's about it. I will never buy it again."
4,It works for me,"I started using this deodorant about a week ago after picking some up on a whim, and I love it. It does last the full 24 hours for me and possibly longer. My favorite thing about it is how great my skin feels there now. It feels soft, smooth, and clean. It's awesome. I apply it right after getting out of the shower (i.e. after I've shaved), and I haven't experienced any burning or redness. Of course, it is winter right now, so we'll see how well this does for me during summer. Hopefully it works because I never want to go back to using antiperspirants."
1,Burning Rash,"If this doesn't cause a rash for you, you're in the happy minority. For many people out there [...] it causes the skin to peel off your armpits and a burning sensation. This seems to be occurring specifically with their ""long lasting"" varieties.best of luck-"
1,Burns my skin!,"I bought Tom's long-lasting care, apricot, deodorant at the urging of my boyfriend who feared my use of aluminum based antiperspirants. Initially, it worked fine, by the end of the day I had some b.o. but it wasnt much and I'd just shower anyway. However, a few weeks in I felt a burning sensation in my arm pits that would not go away. I thought it was because I was using an old razor, but the burning continued after I replaced the razor. My skin has been red, raised and burning for a week. Now I read that this has happened to other users of this deodorant. I'll be switching to another deodorant right away."
2,It burns my armpits!,"I would not recommend the Tom's of Maine long-lasting natural deodorant, especially for those with sensitive skin. I do not have sensitive skin by any means, but this deodorant caused my armpits to burn for an hour after application. I tried it every day for about a week before giving up. I was hoping that maybe my skin would adapt to it or something, but it didn't happen. It gave great protection and I smelled fresh all day and night, but I couldn't get past the burning. Also, Tom's of Maine is a little more expensive than regular deodorants at about $6 per stick. One other thing I didn't like too much about it is that it went on more like a gel so it took a while for it to dry after applying. I did like that they have a wider variety of scents to choose from."
1,"Burns like crazy, stains pits, and left bumps.","I switched from ""regular"" deodorants to the natural ones because we shifted all of our products we eat and use in that direction. Regular deodorants never made me break out or caused burning, but this one was bad. It burned pretty bad for almost an hour, even after washing it off with soap and water. My wife's pits were left stained (not her shirt, but her actual skin was stained) and she had lots of small bumps.We are switching to Aubrey Organics deodorant, and we might try Weleda as well. Deodorant is one of the trickiest products to find a natural/organic replacement for, and one of the last products left we don't have a favorite for yet.5.cl"
1,Doesn't fight smell; makes skin raw and red,"I was very enthusiastic when I initially ordered this, but my disappointment is now the only thing I can associate with the Tom's brand. I tried the product for more than three weeks, thinking that maybe the redness and burning would go away with time. Unfortunately it didn't. The lemongrass smell was nice at first, but it did nothing after about an hour and a half. I have never had issues with odors, but this does nothing to mask the smell that accrues with the wear of the regular work day. If you are planning to exercise, forget it! It won't hold up. It gets on clothing easily and shows up as a filmy paste under your arms even if you use it sparingly. Using it in larger quantities also didn't make it work more effectively. I'm switching to arm and hammer just to see if I can possibly find a deodorant that is natural and doesn't contain aluminum."
2,"Sadly, it didn't work.","I've been interested in trying a natural, aluminum-free deodorant for quite some time. I picked the apricot smell because it was pleasant and not too strong and the other choice was lavender, which can sometimes smell too ""organic-y"" for my tastes. Unfortunately, this pick just doesn't work.This deodorant says it provides 12-hour protection, whereas my aluminum-containing Dove deodorant claims 24 hour-long protection. I don't usually struggle with body odor and have never smelled myself with Dove deodorant, even after a period longer than 24 hours. However, with Tom's, even while I'm aware that it wouldn't last as long, I can smell body odor in just 5 or 6 hours. Gross!!! I feel I need either to shower or reapply the deodorant every few hours or so, which just isn't realistic. On a minor note, I also don't like how the solid stick becomes liquid in consistency upon application and takes forever to dry. So sad. I really would like to find an alumnium-free deodorant that works!"
2,Just doesn't work well,"I've been trying to switch all of my personal care products to organic products, so I like that this is a widely available organic deoderant. (It's sold in my local grocery store and in Target.) I also like the apricot scent. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work for me. I've never been a really big sweater or had to worry about whether I stink, but with this I am constantly reapplying and worried that I smell. I don't care for the sticky feeling when I first put it on, but it dries so I can get over that. It just doesn't last though. It says 12 hours but I find myself starting to smell sweat much sooner than this. I really wanted it to be great, and I guess it's fine if you don't mind reapplying throughout the day, but that's not for me."
1,Hated it,"Not only did it not stop body odor, it irritated my skin. This is supposed to be better for me?This product was the last straw. Between this and the toothpaste that didn't prevent cavities, I'm never using a Tom's of Maine product again. If you want to go natural, there are much better and more effective products out there. For example,Crystal Body Deodorant, 4.25 Oz, (Pack of 2)- 4 Totalworks better and doesn't give you skin irritation."
4,"great, natural product works well for most.","This deoderant does have a slight scent - it smells mildly citrus-like, very mellow, and appropriate for men and women. I have been using it for about a year now, and have been very pleased. It does a good job of covering up everyday body odor, without being over-powering, and without polluting your body with petrochemicals. It does not last all day if you sweat all the time. I work outdoors during the summer, and sweat all day, and by the end of the day, I stink, even with this stuff on. If you have a desk job or any other job that does not require you to exert yourself physically, this will work well for you. I wouldn't reccommend using it on broken skin, as it can cause irritation."
5,An Avid Fan!!!,"I have been using Tom of Maine's deodorant with Apricot scent. I had used several deodorants in the market and i really love this one because it does not include aluminum- NO ALUMINUM!!! Aluminum can darkens your armpit which makes it really unattractive. The apricot scent is not overpowering. I didn't even know i was using an apricot scent in the beginning because i could not smell it at all. I applied it once a day and that covers my 24 hour of odor control. As a nurse in ICU, i really needed something to control my underarm sweat and odor.I therefore, highly recommend this product. I just look at the company's website to find out what's the latest product. It's amazing how involve they are and helping with the environment."
2,Soapy Arm Pits,"While the product did do the minimum job of blocking B.O., the deodorant had one major issue that made me throw it out. If you get out of the shower, dry off, and then apply the deodorant, your arm pits get sudsy! I think this is to do with the sodium stearate, aloe, and glycerin byproducts, all found in soaps. So if you want a similar effect from this deodorant, just take some soap and rub it under your arm pits! Probably would work just as well, but if you don't want sudsy arm pits, look elsewhere."
4,This will grow on you...,"I love Tujiko Noriko, so I picked this up as soon as it was released, tossed it in the stereo at work, and barely even noticed it for the next forty minutes or so. Then I got home, put it on, and AGAIN I could barely pay attention to it. It was too unobtrusive and I stuck it on my shelf.Good thing I picked it up again six months later. Now it's on heavy rotation, and the more I listen to it, the more I like it. Individually, the songs aren't exactly compelling, but once you get into it, you realize how well this album really flows. It's soothing and relaxing and will make you bob your head, although you won't exactly be humming the tunes afterwards. Overall, it's a pretty rad collaboration, just be sure to give it a few listens to let it sink in."
4,"Oh, when music was raw and organic. Those were the days","If you love clumsy, punky, jazzy, bluesy, funky, innocent, organic, experimental, angry, careless, obscure, noncommercial and original music this is your guy."
1,Unnecessary Elements Ruin A Good CD,"I bought this CD because of the interview footage with Phil, Thin Lizzy members, friends, family, etc. And then the ""spoken moments"" segue--eight different times--into cover songs by Dizzy Lizzy..... HUH???? Why????? While I admire a band that covers strictly Thin Lizzy tunes, I don't like it mixed in with old footage of the real thing. The least they could have done would be to cover some less obvious songs (Jailbreak again? Zzzzzz). Overall, this CD didn't cut it for me."
5,Worth several hearings,"Though I enjoy the Gielgud/Richardson recording, this is simply a superlative recording. All three of the principles: Roger Allam, Simon Russell Beale, and Stella Gonet turn in incredible performances. This recording, compared to the forementioned Gielgud/Richardson recording, is full of vitality and energy. The clarity and accessibility to a modern audience, and the incidental music adds perfectly to the mood and theme of this play. I highly recommend this, an exemplary performance of perhaps Shakespeare's most underrated play."
2,Not very good,"Dissapointing, not what I expected. Would not buy it, would return it if possible. Not misleading just not very good."
3,Elizabeth Kaitan in Patticoat Planet,"brief synopsis: Astronaunt Steve Rogers wildest fantasy comes true when his spaceship crash lands on a planet inhabited solely by ultra-sexy, whiskey-swilling cowgirls ecstatic to finally have a man in their misdst.But will Steve go for the sultry sheriff, the frisky mayor or the demure barmaid? Turns out, the decision may not be up to him after all."
5,The most moving book about overcoming odds...,"One of the most powerful narratives I've ever read.Not just because the author overcame great odds to go on and achieve great things, but because he honestly describes his lack of faith in God and then describes the day he comes to believe in the God of his real father.I can't say enough good things about this book, so, I'm just buying copies for all my friends, and letting them see for themselves.Marsha Marks, author of 101 SIMPLE LESSONS FOR LIFE."
4,How a man overcame a sad childhood,"Walter Anderson came from an abusive home and his mother had a secret; the father who beat him was not his father at all. Anderson overcame his problems by joining the Marines and there he excelled in the harsh but disciplined environment. He finished his degree, did a stint in Viet Nam, and ended up as a journalist, spurred on by the success of an article he wrote about the Vietnamese during his tour.Anderson tracks down his secret past and makes more astonishing discoveries. This is an inspiring book, full of hope and redemption. And it's well-written. If you enjoy memoirs and stories of triumph over hardships, this is for you."
5,An Evocative Story About Overcoming Challenges,"Walter Anderson makes a wonderful contribution to memoir writing in this fabulous book. As he explores not only his upbringing but also his sense of despair at his circumstances, he displays a courage that many of us would have trouble exhibiting. His manner of writing was breathtaking, and I read the book in just about 4 hours. I couldn't put it down. Also, since I am a dean at a community college, I was inspired by how he went from being a high school dropout to a Marine to a community college graduate, and then a four-year college graduate and then enjoying his current success. It says a great deal about opportunity--sought and grabbed. This is a must read!"
2,Lacking,I thought this sounded like a great book. It had all the makings for a great book but it just didn't get there for me. I enjoyed hearing about Walter Anderson's life growing up and I felt for him. I thought he was one smart and tough cookie. I think for me the book sort of fell apart at the end when he connects with his half brother. For me it just didn't live up to the build up that the reviews and book jacket gave it.I think I would have been a happier reader if the story had just focused on his success as a person and less on him finding his half brother.
3,Not what I thought,"I was expecting a dog chew with a little more ""chewing"" to it but these crumble like biscuits. It's a 3-second treat experience for my terriers. Next time I'll know to skip over ""natural chews"" and go straight for the bully sticks."
1,Choose Costa Rica,"This book was written in 1994 or 1996 and nothing is current. A lot has changed in Costa Rica in 15 years + so the book is almost worthless. A huge disappointment that a book that old would be available, w/out posting the copywrite. Probaly won't buy any again."
5,-good music,i chose this selection for it songs that make up the one thin lizzy cd i have in my collection
1,Not enough hits!,"I can actually only remember the one song ""The boys are back in town"" and that is it. Can't really get into the other songs. Not enough rememerable music there for me. I wouldn't buy it myself. Wonder what has happened to the artist?"
5,I'm definately going to buy more Thin Lizzy albums...,"Before I got this disc recently, I'd never owned a Thin Lizzy album. I wanted a good overview, and this is pretty good...I understand it doesn't feature songs from every album, but this disc is 76 minutes long, and not one song is bad. Metallica's late bassist Cliff Burton loved Thin Lizzy, and that's what made me want to check these guys out, and I couldn't be happier. This is rock at it's best! I'm going to start collecting every Thin Lizzy album, and I suggest you do the same if you haven't already."
3,Sounded like it was recorded in their garage,"After having seen them live, and purchased there other albums when they first came out, this CD is of poor quality I feel, recordings made before they really got into developing there live versions which brings me to the Live And Dangerous CD is GREAT"
3,GARGLE!!!!!,"Oh, what a weird album! First of all, Thin Lizzy ain't metal. I don't care what anyone says (listen to Dancin' In The Moonlight)The first few songs are pretty bad and un-metal. Then, they start getting louder and tougher. Then comes the atrocious Danicin' In The Moonlight, which I never really listened to. The songs after that are very good, then closes with the best song on the album, Dedication. I would reccomend this album to any 70's hard rock fan, but I think Jailbreak would please me more."
3,Electric Folk-Hard Rock,"Thin Lizzy was one of the most popular rock bands of the late 70's. Although they have a reputation to be heavy metal, they most certainly are not. They are folk rock, with some hard rock influences. And although many of the songs on here are great, some of them are pathetic. Starting with The Rocker and ending with Fighting My Way Back, all those songs are hard to be called rock, let alone metal. But unlike most compilations, the second half is MUCH better, including Boys Are Back In Town and Dedication, my personal favorite. But a word of warning,: these guys aren't has metal as they are made out to be."
1,False Advertising--GREAT PRODUCT,"I rate this item as 1 star, because it say's ""PACK OF TWELVE""...It's one bottle. What discourages me more, I told the company about this error, and 6 months later it's still false advertising.THE PRODUCT IS GREAT!"
5,Correction to my Previous Review,"I have a couple of corrections to make. First I put out to get you, what I meant to put was Loose Control (I was listening to Out to Get you at the Time), and not only did it speak to me, it moved, got deep inside my soul and let me feel what the band was feeling. I mean the music was just so amazing, it felt as if I was right there making the album. Sure Gold Mother was a bit better (mainly because of Crescendo), but this album had two of their greatest hits (added on). God blessed James with incredible talent, and I hope that their new album is even better than this one."
4,Good dvd!,The actual video is very good. It goes into detail without being a drag. The only reason I cant give this a 5 out 5 is because the tabs it comes with are inaccurate sometimes. Its really good. Buz mcgrath shows how he comes up with riffs and how to play some of the more difficult songs unearth made. Its worth it if your a fan of unearth.
3,Good News.....Bad News,The good news is my son LOVED it. He has not put it down since we opened the box. Now for the bad news...ours doesnt work ;0/ I tried 3 sets of batteries and no luck. Luckily my son didnt realize that it was supposed to talk so I just removed the voice box and added some extra stuffing and gave darth some well hidden stitches.
5,Too cute!!!,"I was originally going to get this for my son's christmas but he was with us and guess what he would not forget about it so I went ahead & gave it to him. I thought it was too cute!! He loves Darth Vader so it was perfect. He wrestles around with it, hugs it, but he will not take it to bed with him. Yeah it looks a little weird but it will not stop your little one from liking it. Toys R Us was almost out of these toys so if you want to give your little one this as a christmas present you better go ahead & get one now. He'll love it!!"
5,Darth,This is a wonderful toy for all ages. I purchased one for my 6 year old and then had to order one for my 13 year old!!
4,Good but not great,I brought this becuse I uses alot of USB devises they all work exept for my exturnal hard drive and i brought this one because it was powered an should be able to run the hard drive. It would just be the one drive that dosent work but for eveything else it work like it should
2,Didn't Last Long,I've had this about 7 months and it burned up on me today. It got ultra hot and then ports started failing on me.
2,"Good overall, but a bit unstable","It's great when it works, but the one I got goes off and back on by itself at least once a day (if not more often), causing all the plugged in devices to turn off -- meaning losing data in case external hard drives were plugged in. Beware."
3,Very nice USB hub - but beware!,"This hub is convenient and well designe and my initial reaction to it was 5 stars. However, there are some issues that have popped up over time. One is my fault. There are some peripherals that require a firewire connection - like my Apple camera for the computer screen. Had to buy another camera with a USB connection, which serendipitously, is a much better one - so no harm, no foul. The second is more serious. Because there are so few ports on my MacBook Pro, the use of a hub is critical. This hub is underpowered in terms of being the primary connection for the Wacom tablet. There's a constant 'shake' that occurs when placing pen to tablet. A word of warning - this is what Wacom tech support informed me and we ran a test connecting directly to the Power Book which eliminated the shake. Maybe there's a different source of the problem, but for now I'm going to have to invest in a better hub."
1,Stay away from this one!,"This is the second time this model USB hub has failed in 8 months Amazon replaced the first one w/o any problems, just as I am sure they or Belkin will replaced this defective unit. The question is, who pays me for my lost time and productivity? If you're looking for a high quality, solid 7-Port USB hub, get the D-Link DUB-H7 hub. I've purchased a dozen of these hubs for home and office and they work perfectly. Okay the design of the D-Link units isn't as nice as the Belkin's, but looking nice and not working isn't a great combo."
4,nice little gadget,I like the fact that i have an uncluttered desk with this 7port hub. I wish the ports were on the top of the hub instead of the side 'cos it is cumbersome to use with the current design. But it works and i am happy.
5,Plug 'n' Play,Great little USB hub. It has 7 ports and works right out of the box. The units can also be stacked in case you run out of ports on one and want to add another. Can't beat it for the price (I got mine for around $30).
3,Fairly Happy,I like the flexibility of this Hub but I was a bit surprised that my iPad would not charge when plugged into the hub using the Apple cable. So far that is the only issue I've had since purchasing.
5,As advertised,Well built and as advertised. I use it to charge my flip camera so I don't have to put the extra weight on my computer's built in USB drive
3,GOOD,"GOOD, BUT CAN NOT CHARGE MY IPHONE WHEN PC IS OFF.IT HAS A POWER SUPPLY, IF IT CAN CHARGE USB DEVICES WHEN PC IS OFF, THAT WILL BE GREAT."
2,Doesn't fully work,"So far, the back ports are working but flash drives plugged into the top ports are refusing to show up. I don't have time to troubleshoot such a trivial purchase so I'll just be throwing it away. Waste of time and money."
3,Great but..,This is actually a great product except i ordered for a brown but it came in black instead. Invoice stated F5U307-BRN and packaging also stated F5U307-BRN. But i still think the color is not brown. My friend agreed with me. Otherwise it would be a 5 star.
1,It'll probably die on you,"I bought three of these hubs for different locations. All three died within the space of six months. It's a pity, because I like the design - useful number of ports and handy having two on top. But three duds makes it more than a coincidence.I've also had problems with the long-term reliability on some 7-port hubs from other manufacturers, but generally have a better experience with four-port models, so I'll be sticking to the latter from now on."
1,This item may be a fire hazard,"BUYER'S WARNING: This hub and items attached to it (e.g. my wireless mouse) were frequently spontaneously shut off and on. The unit got extremely hot, so hot in fact that I could not keep a finger against its base. As I had it sitting on a wooden desk, I was fearful that this could realistically represent a fire hazard. I am returning the unit for a refund. This appears to be a very common problem with this USB hub."
2,Stylish but spotty reliability,"Despite this being a powered USB hub (power adapter included), some accessories plugged into this hub end up underpowered, and others don't draw enough power to register on the desktop's bus."
5,Great fun!,"I purchase this originally for my Mom as a Christmas gift, but she had finished all of her other cross stitch and wanted another one. She loves it! Every time I visit, she is constantly working on it.It didn't come with a needle (as described), but she already had some so it wasn't a big deal. Other than that, everything was included and the instructions (from her point of view) are easy to understand. Colors are pretty much the same.So if you have someone who loves cross stitch (and kitties), they'll loved this one!"
1,Nostalgia won't be milked.,"Many people will watch 80s films for the nostalgia. ""Police Academy"" and ""16 Candles"" will never be of high acclaim, but they can make many people happy. This is not the case here. A continuing theme here is about being locked in a meat locker and I find that creepy, rather than funny or entertaining. The villain is so hateful that you can tell how the scriptwriters did not want viewers to sympathize with him. If you like burly hairy types (with that Robin Williams or Ron Jeremy look), you will enjoy the men who show all their business early in the film. Also, fans of ""Third Rock from the Sun"" may love seeing John Lithgow. However, this film has few redeeming features. There are other 80s movies to peep, rather than this one."
1,Not good for cold weather!,"I live in Chicago and it gets awfully cold in the winter. On really cold days, the doorbell would ring by itself! Sometimes it would make this horrible dying cat sound in the middle of the night when it was extremely cold. It was so annoying that I had to remove the batteries and discontinue using it. Also, the battery in the doorbell buzzer would come loose if you pressed it too hard, so most of the time it didn't work anyway. I was very disappointed with this doorbell."
3,both caps are the same,Hi just to let you know than both caps came the same there is no way to know wich one is the pen or pencil normally the pen haves a black dot in the cap.and the pencil nothing. Thanks
2,Attractive but not durable,Towel bar is visually attractive but the quality isn't up to par with other Moen lines of hardware. For instance the disc that covers the wall anchor feels like plastic metal.
1,Very good exampels from WW11,This is a very unique view of private European collections of militaria that you don't get to see state side. Alot of stuff was just left when we came home and some of the smart people over there started colections. Thanks to the author we get to share this treasure.
2,Great Pictures - Lacks Detail,"The author did a great deal of research and the photos of the original equipment are very good - but the level of detail required for a serious student is not there. I would say it's a good overview, but titling it as an ""encyclopedia"" is a stretch. I would probably have rated it three stars except for the price.I am still looking for a reference that discusses construction, materials, dates of manufacture/issue, etc."
3,Guinness World Records 2003,I got the book for my grandson as he didn't have that year and I was pleased to find a new one on Amazon. MARIE DIEHL
2,Lack of information comparable with Guinness 2002,"yupe, i agree that the paper of the Guinness 2003 has better quality and the color is much better. but in term of the records, it seem like Guinness Editor take out some of the part of the records such as in Guinness 2002 (Fame and Money). And Information for the ""building and Structure"" seem LACK of information comparable to Guinness 2002...i would said that this year Guinness 2003 is NOT RECOMMENDED to own it... it's wasted of money...here, i hope that the editor of Guinness would take this as review for the next edition (2004)..."
3,Buy 2004,There is realy no point of buying this book because you can buy the 2004 edition which is three times better then this one.
