2,i just can't get into it...,"i do apologize to tool fans everywhere, but this record is not very good. The problem i have is adam jones just belting out the same guitar progressions as he usually does on every record. i do appreciate his effort with the talk box solo on jambi, but it's nothing special. many of the songs i find sound too similar to ""the patient"" or ""The Grudge"". and wings for marie part 1 and 2 are dull and lengthy.It seems that tool is past their prime. all i recommend is to listen to their previous albums, which at least have some form of variety"
2,Only four good Songs,"If this album was nothing but static noise I'm sure a lot of the Tool fans giving positive reviews for `10,000 days' would still give it five stars. Just because it's a Tool album and all your cool friends like Tool, doesn't mean this is any good. There are only four real songs on `10,000 day' and the rest is just unenergetic snaky guitar rifts and stupid filler. Where is all the solid fast passionate guitar work of the past? These guys have one of the greatest drummers in the world and it hardly seems he's doing any thing. I don't really understand why the band bothered to put half the songs on this CD let alone name them; they really should have named song 11 'static noise filler' because that's all it is. Maybe the band thought the cool album cover with the glasses and trippy pictures would cause fans to over look the rest of this steaming bowl of elephant piss."
2,Mediocre at best,"I bought this album the day it came out and was thuroughly disappointed. I wanted to write a bad review then, but decided to wait a few months and give the album a chance to redeam itself. Well, it's been a few months and I've listened to the album a few more times. If this was the first Tool album, then I think I would give it some praise because Tool's sound is just so unique. However, after listening to Lateralus (a masterpiece), Undertow, Aenima, and Opiate, this album simply doesn't measure up. It sounds like the Lateralus B-sides that never made the cut. Some of the songs have huge potential, but never turn into anything worth remembering. I would expect more from this great band. I don't understand how Tool fans can like this album. Is the ""happy smoke"" clouding your judgement? It is such a let down. Tool are still one of my favorite bands, and Lateralus is still one of the best albums in my collection. if you are still curious about this album, then buy it used."
4,damn... someone needs to get a life,"I listened to this cd, it's pretty good. You can hear the meshuggah influence, lotsa a fun to listen to. But that's not why I'm writing this review. Some of you Tool fans take yourselves way to seriously. This is commercial music that will sell millions of copies. Stop with the ""high art"" crap that ""takes time to fully appreciate."" It just makes you sound pretentious. Tool is playing power chords for God's sake! They're not that innovative! If someone doesn't like tool, maybe it's cuz they don't like it, not because they don't understand their musical genius."
5,Tool never disappoints. Excellent album. Mind bending.,It takes awhile to get an album out of these guys. Only goes to show that greatness does require time. I do not consider myself knowledgable on the technical fine points of music so I won't try. Just a great album
5,First Day in 10 000,"Tool has never been an ""easy listen"" Sunday music.Not a single Tool album satisfied me after the first listen.I've listened to 10 000 Days for last 8 hours non-stop. with every passing hour, with each ray of sun less, with each minute into the night, the tangled web of 10 000 days becomes clearer and clearer, what seemed to be an echo of past Tool works becomes an anchor in the ship sailing where Tool had never been before. Maynard lyrics are one of the best pieces of writing in rock ever. The rhytmic section is powerful as never before.It will take me 10 000 days to get bored with it."
5,Worth the wait.,"Like most Tool albums the first time I listened to it I thought, ""What did they do?"" By the third time I heard it I understood and now I love it. As for all you dummies in here trying to start a fight... go get a girlfriend or something. Life is about more than video games and the internet."
4,it really isn't THAT bad,"After buying all of Tool's cd's and absorbing as much as possible from them, I bought this cd and can tell you unbiasedly that I really do like this album. Many of my friends have stated that it takes a lot of getting used to because of long introductions, lack of lyrics, etc. To me though, that's almost the beauty of the album. It leaves so much up to the imagination, and music can be music without lyrics (or not many). The bass riffs and drums i feel run parallel with albums like Lateralus. I think if you're willing to give something new by Tool a try, this would definitely qualify. It's in my top 3."
5,"Innovative, Interesting Offering from Tool","Despite the reviews indicating the ""inaccessibility"" of the album, I purchased 10,000 days and was blown away. While there are some similarities to the rythmic undertones of Lateralus, Kennan's vocal acrobatics take center stage on songs like ""The Pot."" His vocal runs are nothing less than capitvating. Tool continues to evolve into something that trancends their genre. This album is worth the investment."
5,"You are the light and way, that they will only read about.....","This Album is really good, i forgot the fact that i didnt think much of Aenima & Lateralus on my first few listens either. If you are a Tool fan of old, open your ears and wait before making an abstract review that you will only regret anyway. Also 10,000 days (wings pt 2) is sheer brilliance! I give this album 4.8 stars when compared to the above mentioned albums.Give it time ok, hell if you put on third eye for a non tool fan they will think your ludicrous but we love it. Dont force it upon you, surrender yourself to it."
3,Lateralus 2,"This is coming from a huge Tool fan who's girlfriend got annoyed when I started talking about the new album months before it came out and said that I was ""gay for Tool"". Perhaps my expectations were too high but when you wait this long for a progressive band to release something new you can be quite dissapointed that it sounds too much like the previous album. I was disapointed that the cd lacks dynamic. With Aenima (my favorite album by any band) The needle in my heart would go shooting up and divebomb down, but with 10,000 days that needle only drags along. At no time was I shocked or amazed. I only reccomend this cd for the true tool fans that must have every album (like myself), but if you are new to Tool and want your socks knocked off you'll have to get Aenima."
5,Good ALBUM,"This CD is just as great as their other albums, people just built up their expectations waaaaaaaaaaaay too high. True, it does have a few recycled riffs, but even Led Zeppelin ripped themselves off too.The main thing you have to keep in mind when listening to this album is that it is an album. Not singles. Album. Every song is part of a larger picture.10,000 days is a little softer than Lateralus or Aenima, but it's still very good. It's a little bit of a grower too, so if you don't at first like it, keep listening to it and you'll eventually come around.This is definalty a bass and drum masterpiece though. The weekest part is the guitars, but the bass and drum (especially the bass) are awesome.1. Vicarious(7:09)2. Jambi(7:31)3. Wings For Marie (Pt 1)(6:31)4. 10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)(11:16)5. The Pot(6:24)6. Lipan Conjuring(1:13)7. Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann)(3:48)8. Rosetta Stoned(11:13)9. Intension(7:23)10.Right In Two(8:58)11.Viginti Tres(5:03)"
1,MEH!,"This is by far Tool's most dull and pretentious album yet. That's right, pretentious, coming from a band with a mediocre bassist and guitarist, with lyrics that may or may not be total bulls**t. I actually have listened to this album, and the concept is so cryptic, I don't think it's possible for it to be valid, yet you Tools who worship this band call it ""deep"". Want to hear deep? Pick up Dark Side of the Moon, not this overhyped pretentious wankfest. Stop being a bunch of Tools (intentional)."
2,5 years ?,"The following ... are not members of tool... roger waters , david gilmour , nick mason , richard wright .... nin , tool and radiohead are the greatest of modern dark bands , but for fans to push and label them with the king of dark bands only makes it hard on these great acts.... now why did this have to be adam's band ? tool please expand !!!! 5 years ...."
2,"Departure from ""Conventional""Tool","The album sounds somewhat like Tool for the majority of songs, but they departed from the Indian sound that they successfully incorporated into 'Lateralus'. As pleasing as gutteral screaming is to my ears, I don't actually appreciate vocals that are actually screaming-- 'Intension' and 'Rosetta Stoned' are just gutteral screaming. Those two tracks are absolutely awful. Tool also explores a little more instrumental in this album than in the last. Overall, I would call this album a dose of very sub-par Tool."
5,freaking awsome,"ohh my mother fockin god.this is such a good album, tool has gotten better over there years maybe it had to do with the band hanging out with bands like fantomas and massuggah while maynerd was with APC.Some songs have massuggah feels to them which is dope.I litterally had an orgasm when I heard 10,000 days for the first time I knew they wouldn't dissapoint there fans.And maynerd's vocals and lyrics are so good.And to all those people who say tool sold out and this is there worst yet i say FU you know nothing about music and your a disgrace to mankind and you shouldnt be allowed to live"
1,Not worth the wait!,"I feel like a TOOL for buying this album. What a waste. It took 5years 2 write 1 good song. WOW, 1,825 days for 1 song."
1,Refreshing new music,"Tool is new to me, having been introduced to Laterus in 2005... This new album 10,000 Days is off the chain. The band is fluid and generates or should I say radiates energy from their music. It's nice to hear metal played clean, tight and leaving you with wanting to play the album over and over again."
5,Their Best Ever,"This Tool CD is freaking amazing - their best ever. Saw them in concert 2 nights ago and was a religious experience for 3,000 people - no words to describe it! Tool is just awesome and this CD is amazing."
3,good but not great,"I have listened to this album a few times already and the first thing that hit me was that the time signature changes are amazing, it's hard to keep track of whats happening at times! 10,000 days is like the halfway point between Aenema and Lateralus (A very good thing in my opinion). Vicarious is probably one of the strongest tool songs up to this point. However, after a few more listens it dawned on me that this album sounds like a death metal album, bogged down in technicality whilst losing sight of the songs.It sounds as though the band had written the songs and Maynard has come in it at a later stage to ""throw"" the vocals over the top... Somehow it seems forced. However, if you are a fan of technical,experimental rock then this album is definitely for you, i just dont think it is as well-rounded and focused as previous efforts."
3,Good but not their absolute best,"Tool is one of my favorite bands, but I was a little dissappointed with their new album release. I was hoping that it would be similiar to their previous albums. At first, when hearing the new album I was confused and it didn't sound like the Tool I know and listened to for many years. However, I still liked the new album but I only really loved one song which is plays on the radio here a lot. I think they were trying to make this album more radio friendly, in my opinion. Anyway, they are still one of my favorite bands and I look forward to hearing more albums from them. Hopefully, next time they will give us something more to what we are use to with their music. I still recommend TOOL fans to buy the new album."
5,TOOL,"This cd is awesome if you are a TOOL fan. If your a nut rag you probably won't like it. All in All EVERY track on this CD is incredible. I own every TOOL cd and enjoy Alex Grey a lot. When they decided to work together on Lateralus it was nice, when they worked together on this project it turned out very very well. So if you did'nt like this album thats your fault for hearing it and not listening to it."
3,Good album...but is lacking,"Tool is once again giving us an album full of melody and haunting lyrics. However, 10k Days seems to drastically fall short of the usual ""feel"" that Tool's music brings. Something I can't quite put my finger on seems to have been left out of this album: something that has made the four(five if you count Salival) preceding CDs come to life. I personally rank 10k Days my least favorite of Tool's albums, but it is a good purchase regardless."
4,"On my way to 10,000 listens.","Well here it is. Another 75 minutes of epic metal. I doubt your average Tool fan will be disappointed. I honestly would have been happy with something shorter and with more punch like ""Undertow"" again, but here we get what ""Lateralus"" basically was, in a good way. A lengthy disc where no song stands-out, but the entire album does as a whole. One thing I wanted to mention that few have, is how incredible the packaging is. Each Tool album has had consistently unique artwork, and ""10,000 Days"" takes the cake so far. It has numerous double images in a cd book, that when viewed through the special glasses (which are part of the case) make for excellent 3-D pictures. Under the right light they just jump out at you. Very colorful, very creepy, very Tool."
3,Not living up to Tool's Standard,"I think tool set the bar to high on Lateralus. I would give this album 1 star, but because I am a tool fan I am giving it 3. This album has about 37 minutes of noise on it, and only about 4 actual complete songs, only 2 of which I like. I still think tool's best albums are Lateralus and Undertow, even Aenima is a better album than this one. I consider a great album, one that I can listen to the entire CD over and over again, I can't do that with this CD. Oh well, This is just my opinion. You don't have to agree"
4,Introduction to Tool,"I wasn't a fan of Tool until I heard Vicariuos, Jambi, The Pot, and 10,000 days. But once I heard those, the other songs followed, as well as the other cds."
5,Just another Tool CD?,"Is 10,000 Days just another one of Tool's work, to me, it is a masterpiece. 10,000 Days is worth every penny in my opinion. It may sound like their older album (Lateralus), but when you sit down and listen to it, it is completely different. Tool kept to their Blood and Heritage when it came to this Album. Anyone who has listen to a Tool album before and enjoyed it should check this one out, and anyone wanting to see what Tool is all about would enjoy it too."
5,They never fail to blow your mind away.,"The newest album from Tool can easily be called their best work yet from beginning to end the sounds will blow your mind away. I have been a fan of Tool ever since Undertow and each album gets better and better, even for people who do not like Tool or rock music you need to give this a listen and experience some of their genius."
3,New to Tool,"I'm glad I read the review by ""andreaabs"". I had never really gotten into Tool and never owned (or listened to an entire CD before). I'm more into old school metal (Megadeth, Metallica, judas Priest, etc). I heard some samplings on the radio and thought I'd invest in the 10,000 days CD. ""Vicarious"" rocks and I listened to it over and over. Most of the rest of the CD is kind of drab for someone with hard hitting tastes like mine. After reading andreaabs' review, I will be tempted to check out some of their earlier stuff."
2,disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed with this product. It was difficult to put together because the pre-drilled holes did not match up very well. One spot I could not get to screw in at all. The wine rack is designed poorly. If you barely bump into the table all of the wine bottles come crashing down. I lost a really nice ceramic bowl that was sitting on the bottom shelf. The shipping took forever and the box looked like it was dropped out of the plane at 30,000 feet."
3,"Generally infomative, good for beginners.",Pictoral history and year by year overview of Shelby Mustang.Lack of specific information conerning engines.Hits the well known points that have been told before.Breaks no new ground.Excellent photos.
5,A great book on Shelby Mustangs.,If you're into Shelby mustangs then this book will interest you.A historical look through the years with good photographs do this book justice.Not a comprehensive book on these Mustangs.Owner's/would be owner's and enthusiasts will enjoy this book.Good value.Worth adding it to your collection.
5,A Must for Every Femail,"This is a guideline for every female who feels a little lost in terms of dealing with life. I read and loved the first edition, giving it as presents to all my female friends, and now I am giving this new edition. This is NOT a guide on bullying those about a woman, but a guide for a woman taking charge of her own life. Significant quotes from role models, excellent cartoon depictions, and a breezy style charge with the authority every woman needs to be the best her she can."
3,Funny but you pretty much read the whole book in one chapter,Funny book and makes a good point but you get it after one chapter... it was slightly repetitive.
3,It's okay,"This book has some funny lines, but I wouldn't consider it original or educational. There are better books for women to help them be assertive and independent. I would recommendinstead ""Beauty fades, dumb is forever"" by Judge Judy. She has a lot experience with women not standing for themselves and has great advice for women of all ages."
3,This is me!,You would think I wrote this book. I want to be a peacekeeper but all I do is end up being a doormat! I hope I can learn to be a better person and take care of myself first.....cause after all if u don't take care of yourself no one else is gonna.
2,I don't think so.,"Perhaps I was more in touch with my inner bitch than I realized. Some slightly funny parts, but even they are repetitive. The author's bottom line: If there is something you want, it's OK to ask; if there is something you are asked to do and you don't want to, your best response is to refuse. The author advises practicing refusing by saying the phrase ""I don't think so."" While I think that this phrase allows for continued nagging, which can be avoided by the more direct response ""no, thank you,"" a good place to start practicing saying ""I don't think so"" is when you are asked to buy this book"
3,Just OK.,This book was just ok. I read it in about an hour. It offers some good advice and some not so good. The author states that women in touch with their inner bitch cannot be friends with other women also in touch with theirs. So basically we need only surround ourselves with wimpy people we do not respect. Also the author seems to have a personal negative vendetta against the world. I think there are probably better books on this subject out there. I unfortunately will be returning my copy.
3,I Don't Think So!,"Well, I really neaded this book...as certain family members harass me. This book has taught me to say, ""I don't think so!"" to people who are always asking things of me. This is a semi- comical book...not to long, but just to the point. It makes for a great gift."
4,I don't think so! has become my mantra.,"This book was enormously funny. It is more of a humor book than a self-help book, although much of the advice could be taken seriously. I commend the idea that women should ask for what they want, and say ""I don't think so"" when they aren't being treated right.I read this right after my engagement broke off. It had the immense effect of cheering me up and made me look forward to the life ahead of me."
4,Fun read,"This is a really fun read, but to be honest I preferred her Inner Bitch Guide to Relationships. Whenever I get confused in a relationship, I draw a hot bath and read a chapter or two out of that book. It always reminds me who I am. This book is a good addition to it though, but I think I had already tapped into my inner bitch before I read it."
1,Where's the Bitch?,"Hilts has a long way to go before getting in touch with her inner bitch, and from the advice in this book, it's the blind leading the blind.First, I strongly agree with the reviewer who stated that constant parroting of the mantric, ""I don't think so"" lends oneself to further nagging. A true Bitch (or Bastard) knows that demanding, insensitive people need something more like ""Get stuffed!"" or at the very least, ""Fugghedaboutit.""Second, caveat emptor: This is not a self-help book, but it could be classified at the very least as ""light entertainment"" or ""an amusing bathroom read."" ..."
4,Great Humor..,"Nothing new, but a great, fresh and simply way to takk about it, you can eat-it in a minute!great after-taste, put some oil on your spirit!!"
1,Breaks constantly,"I have had nothing but problems with this bracelet. Everytime I wear it something breaks. Either the cross gets caught on something and falls off or the links pull apart so that the whole bracelet falls off. I've even had the center Ball on a wire peice fall of. How it came off of both sides at onece is beyond me. Whats more, it snags on all my clothing. Don't bye this unless you want to fix it every time you wear it."
2,"Great idea, but mine didn't work...","I loved the idea of this little mouse, unfortunately when I got mine, the left mouse button didn't work. I checked and rechecked to see if I had to program that button in the software. I tried it on multiple computers in our house, and that left button still did not work. Had to return it... Don't know if I just got a lemon or what."
4,"Other than middle clicking, great mouse!","Works great. Very responsive, even for gaming. Good range as well, even for desktops. My mouse can be at least 5 feet away from the USB receiver and there are absolutely no problems. Some say that the USB receiver is a little big, but I don't really mind. My only complaint is that middle clicking doesn't really feel like middle clicking. It's much quieter and doesn't ""pop"" as much as left and right clicking. Other than that, it's a great buy."
4,mouse is great!,"this mouse works great but it is bigger than i thought it would be. I just plugged it in and it has been working great ever since. The USB thing snaps onto the back, but not very well. It falls off very easily, a problem in my backpack."
2,So much for that idea...,"I purchased this mouse to use with my laptop. Was working great when suddenly it decided it doesn't like to have anything underneath it like a mousepad... it won't work on anything other than a table surface and even then it flakes out from time to time. This is after using it for roughly 3 months. And it had started to really eat up the batteries, even with the 'battery saving' options. I'm in the market for a new one now."
2,limited range = limited use,"I got this mouse because the wire on the mouse that came w/ my laptop was a little too short to reach throught the wire manager at the back of my desk & back up to the keyboard tray. Unfortuantely this mouse can't seem to get decent reception at this distanc. The straightline distance is 3 to 4 feet, with the desk surface in between. The performance is exceedingly choppy (useless).The mouse works OK when I move it up onto the desk, but if I wanted it this close I wouldn't need a wireless mouse. I might use it when travelling, but it is worthless in my office."
1,Useless. Died within a month.,"I bought this mouse to replace my Microsoft wireless notebook optical mouse, which stopped working after a few months. This mouse was far quicker to follow suit. The camera within appears to have just died, and this is from very normal use. No rough surfaces, no gaming to stress it. I was dragging it very quickly around and it just stopped working."
2,"Just a normal laptop mouse, definitely not a mini-mouse",Very disappointed with this mouse as it's just a standard laptop mouse and not a mini-mouse at all. I already own two Microsoft laptop mice and this Logitech is simply the same type/size item by a different manufacturer.
3,"USB DONGLE falls off, so battery goes flat quickly","This mouse is a joy to use. It tracks well and responds quicly. Much better than the 'mouse touchpad'The usb dongle clips into the base to switch it off. This is fine if you are not travelling with it. On several occasions, I have had the mouse in the bottom of my laptop bag and the usb dongle has come off. This has resulted in the battery going flat.TIP. If buying this mouse, get a small bag to put it into so that the dongle does not come off OR get a rubber band to wrap around the mouse and the dongle.If I need to buy a new mouse, then next time I will get one that has a usb dongle that docks INSIDE it."
5,Easy to install and easy to use,"Installs easily right out of the package, just plug it in your usb adapter and you're off and running. Feels very smooth on the hand. Smooth and comfortable."
3,fiddly mouse,"This mouse works well and the battery saving feature is great, but the receiver doesn't clip in securely and will come out with the slightest bump - thus rendering the concept pointless. The display on the website doesn't show this poor feature..."
4,My Favorite,"I've been using this Mini Optical Mouse for about 7 years...no problems. The size is perfect for my small hands...so comfortable. This bad boy was built to last...after all these years it still work's perfectly. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I wish the USB receiver was smaller and the mouse had an On & Off switch to it. To turn the mouse off you have to snap the USB receiver on to the bottom of the mouse (it's docking station). If you travel a lot with your Laptop, this Mouse may not be right for you. The USB could easily unsnap from the mouse while in your bag causing it to turn itself on accidently. To be on the safe side you can choose to remove the battery from the mouse before placing it in to your bag or you can do as I always do...use a thick rubber band to secure it in place. This could be a hassle for some, but for me...I still wouldn't trade this Mouse for any other."
1,quality??????,"as a carpenter I need a good reliable cordless to use day in day out, after 18 months I can report that this drill isn't up to the task, I'm sorry but it's just not. Great power...... really good power, but the fact is for the first 12 months I owned it it spent 25% of it time back at the shop, items including new gear box, selector, switch (twice) and battery. I went out and bought a little 12V maktec cordless to use while it was in the shop and use this now more than the Hitachi. the low gear has gone on it once again and the Batterys are on the way out ...... I can't justify spending more money on it, (throwing good after bad). Great power, just bad build quality and service back up"
5,great drill/driver,"Tired of buying cheapo cordless drills that had poor battery life and low power, I was pleasantly surprised by this one. It has great battery life, a smart charger, 3.0AH NiMH batteries (*beware: some DS18DMR kits have two 2.0AH NiCD batteries in an otherwise similar looking box and for the same price!!! It says what is in there on the box. Avoid these!*), great performance, and a fair price. I can't ask for more."
4,Hitachi DS18DMR 18-Volt Ni-Cad 1/2-Inch Drill,"My Hitachi 14.4 drill fell from 18ft and broke. I was not to happy with the lack of torque on it so I purchased the Hitachi DS18DMR 18-Volt NiMH 1/2-Inch Drill. No complaints about lack of torque on this one. I liked the 3.0mah NiMH batteries on this one. The batteries charge in about 40 minutes and give a long run time. This 18 volt drill is considerably heavier than the 14.4, but the extra torque is worth the extra weight. The cordless chuck on the 18volt drill is flawless. It tightens very well."
2,disappointed,"I had high hopes for this drill. As an avid DIY'er, I need tools I can depend on. Although the Hitachi has a nice grip and fairly good power, the batteries are really weeny. I finally got so disgusted after changing the batteries after only an hour of work that I sent it back. My 12 V Makita, which I ran into the ground, was much more efficient. Wouldn't buy again."
1,Good to the first DROP!!!,"I've had this drill since last christmas and have used it 8 or ten times around the house.Today I was installing some new windows and the drill fell from the window sill to the hardwood floor maybe 3 or 4 feet. The drill, that I was counting on to finish my days work BROKE IN TWO.This is in no way acceptable and anyone doing commercial work and relies on their tools needs to steer clear of Hitachi....Man, what a pain. I had to call my wife to bring me my 10 year old Panasonic to finish the job and it still works like a champ!!I've got to call Hitachi to see if they will fix this drill made out of glass....works good besides that!! LOL"
5,Best CD Ever,"This is honestly one of the best CDs i've ever bought, and I've bought quite a few in my time. Louisiana Saturday Night, Day That I Die, and Where The Heart Is are all songs that are along the lines of Mellencamp's Jack and Diane; the kind of songs that actually mean something. BUY THIS CD!!"
4,it's okay for the price,"I just bought these and they are cute for the price. I did notice that they run a little small (I usually wear a 7 1/2 and the 7 1/2 is the exact length of my foot which looks kind of funny)and also that the bottom is made of like a suede-like material that I am sure will get dirty in no time. But other than that if you want a step above a typical flip-flop sandal this is a decent choice, they're pretty comfy too."
5,"A kind of ""Impossible Dream"" story of Life, Hope, and Change...","One of my favorites to reread every five years or so. This is a wonderful adventure story of a young girl's dream to someday be 'A Flyer' on a windswept world where only a very few people can ever own wings - wings created in the distance past with long-forgotten technology and handed down from generation to generation. Read it slowly and savor its plot and character development. My copy of Windhaven is 25 years old and the pages are yellowing, and I was shopping to find hardcover copies to someday give to my children. I'm pleased to see that it is available on Kindle, as it is a work that should both be immortal and available to everyone."
3,Just an okay story,"Windhaven is the story a one person's life in a fantasy setting. It is not a bad story, just not a great one."
2,Grinning over eggs for breakfast has never been so grim,"This is a pretty novel but not at all to my liking. It is so slow and unengaging at the start and seemed to be just an extension of the hang gliding experience. I did become more involved towards the end - but to what purpose? Even as a yarn it was far from convincing, and lacked inner logic.It is also basically soft despite some unpleasant characters (but they are so childish), and incidents. There are too many breakfasts, too many eggs for breakfast, too many hugs and remote relationships - it's the reader that is kept at a distance, not the characters from each other."
2,A Pale Copy,"I read this when it first came out, and have never forgotten my annoyance. I was first attracted to George R. R. Martin because of his ""Sandkings"" story in Omni Magazine, and when ""Windhaven"" came out I bought it on the spot. Unfortunately, it's little more than a copy of Anne McCaffrey's ""Dragonflight"", and a lesser copy at that. Substitute hang gliders for dragons, Maris for Lessa, and everything else is much the same. McCaffrey is better."
2,Disappointing,"I love the works of both authors of Windhaven. I really wanted to like this book. I was prepared to enjoy it. especially after the positive reviews on the cover. My mistake. When I still wasn't engrossed with the story or the characters after the first 100 pages that still, small voice warned me not to waste my time any further. Would that I had heeded my own assessment. This is at most a mediocre story with a rather boring plot. Do yourself a favor. If you have any reservations about reading this book, follow your instinct and save your time and money."
1,terrible,"One of the most unbelieveable rediculas bookes I have ever had to pleasure of not finishing, Horrible subject matter that makes no sense"
3,Not terrible,"For those of you who were drawn to this book because you started with a Song of Fire and Ice, prepare to be disappointed. This book in no way compares to George R. R. Martin's tale of amazingness. However, this book is entertaining in it's own right. The story line is kind of simple and easy to follow, and the characters are pretty simplistic, but it was an ok read."
4,Not too bad!,This book was nice change of pace for me. It wasn't too long and the characters were fairly entertaining. Wasn't engrossing or thought provoking just an entertaining short novel.
2,Fails to soar,"As a fan of Geaorge Martin's magnum opus, A Song of Ice and Fire, I was excited to read Windhaven. It is a story of one girl's efforts to turn tradition upside down and join an elite group of airborne messengers. There is a lot of whining and hand wringing with the central character able to see all sides of an argument to an almost pathological degree. The settings and the premise are interesting, but the characters never get beyond two dimensions. There are some crazy time shifts too, where decades pass withoiut warning. As an exercise in showing how our actions, no matter how noble, can be the source of pain and anguish, it worked. A ripping yarn it is not."
2,mechanical exercise,"This book is more of an intellectual exercise of the consequences of a single action. Maris wants to join the elite flyers of Windhaven and her action drives the plot of the book.The characters are two-dimensional and the plot unfortunately plods along with all the drama of a funeral march. The book is divided into three sections of Maris' life. We see her grow from child to old woman, however, I never had much empathy for her as a character.It was refreshing to see that loose ends do not get tied neatly up when it comes to relationships. Sensitivity to the ups-and-downs of love affairs in general was a strength of the book even if it was handled in a dry way.The book tries to deal with complex politics of the flyers versus the land-bound. This was done with a psuedo-sophistication that I found irritating. The politics of real life are in no way mirrored in the mechanics of the plot. That was the biggest disappointment."
2,Stephen R Donaldson recommends it on the cover,"Stephen R Donaldson recommends it on the cover. Need I say more? Think Pern, delete the dragons, likable lead and child characters but add vicious-acting people. Replace the plot line by petty bickering. A gathering of three stories, originally published between 1975 and 1980. It shows. Did not finish it."
2,Dragonriders of Pern much better,"Anne McCaffrey told this story first, and much better, with her Dragonriders of Pern series. Several plot elements within the two stories are so similar that Martin and Tuttle must have been ""inspired"" by the Pern series. However, McCaffrey fleshes out her world in such a way as to make it seem much more believable than the Windhaven world. Pern's characters are also much better developed than those in this story. It was a disappointment to me to find I was reading a ""Pern-lite"" novel rather than an original story.Pern gets 5 stars. My suggestion: read McCaffrey's novels instead."
1,The Bildungsroman for Britney Spears fans,"the struggles of the unfortunate child/orphan to achieve his/her dreams in a a world dominated by inimical class/gender/race/religious prejudice is as old as the world. It takes masters like Dickens or Kipling to shape the theme into masterpieces. If you liked Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsinger story, you might enjoy this one. If you have already read ""song of ice and fire"", DON'T read it, it would be a let down. Take Donaldson's ""Gap"" series instead, or Peter Hamilton."
3,Okay but lacking real depth,"I chose this book for a children's literature class that I lead based mostly on cost. The other recommended texts in this area are very expensive and I wanted my students to be able to purchase quality trade books as well. I need to supplement the reading a great deal because of the cursory nature of the chapters regarding various genres. For the money, it's a fine text but be aware that it leaves out a great deal that that other books - such as Norton's Through the Eyes of a Child from the same publisher - cover in greater depth."
5,Happy Customer!,I was pleasantly surprised when I recieved the book within a couple of days. It was in good condition just as the seller stated. I wouldn't hesitate ordering again from this seller.
4,Works well with a 512 SD chip.,More convenient to use than plugging in my digital camera to download photos every time. Also works well for managing music on a 1 GB SD chip that I use with a siren MP3 player.
3,good unit to have but finicy on some computers,"This is a good small unit to have but on some computers it is a bit finicky when it comes to plug and play. The unit has a tendacy to either state unit needs to be formated or no media present. When it does work, transfer is good to the media supplied. Also recommended that one gets a USB cord extender so that the unit can be pluged into computers tha have less than usual plug in space on the front."
3,"pretty cool, but not very sturdy","My 3 yeat old received one as an early Chirstams gift, he had it about three hours and then the pice that hold the front axle snapped, the front wheels will no longer stay attached to the vehicle. The porduct says for 3 and up, Maybe for an older child, but deifnetly not for a 3 year old"
2,Fun but fragile,"My mother bought two of these for my sons, ages 3 and 5. They were a lot of fun while they lasted, which wasn't that long! One of the boys snapped the antenna off of his remote, rendering it useless, after only a couple of days. The other boy managed to snap the front axle of his car by driving it down a step and there is no way it can be fixed.One more complaint - the off switch didn't actually work on EITHER car, meaning that the only way to turn it off was to pull the batteries out. Otherwise the lights stayed on and the batteries ran down in about a day and a half."
5,Awesome book.,"For anybody who loves children and/or works with them on a daily basis, this book is for you. Dr. Stafford outlines the importance of children and how they view the world around them. This book is an easy read and something that will inspire or even re-energize those of us who have a passion for the lives of children."
4,Great read,Sensitive readers should be aware there is a discussion of the experience of child abuse.
5,A Must Read!,"A must read for anyone that thinks they have it rough. Wes Stafford takes you on a journey into the life of a missionary's son who grew up with a love for life, even when they didn't have ""stuff"" in their lives.Wonderful book that teaches us that there is so much more to life then having things to fill our lives."
4,"Salt-Free Brown Rice Cakes, Ultra-Thin","I like these flat square cakes because they are easier to spread jam, nut butter on than other traditional cakes. Also they are more compact & don't crumble/crumb as easily. Good for a snack in the car/on-the-go. Good value; easy to store.Only 4 stars because I don't know about quality, pesticides used in Czech Republic where they are made. Would prefer organic. Other Info:Ingredients: 100% Wholegrain Brown Rice26 cakes per package; 20 calories eachKosher-PareveManufactured in Czech Republic"
3,"First, let me start off by saying that I love, love, love","Heather Nova. This CD, however, did not reel me in as her previous works, notably Oyster and Siren. Yes, she is a new mother and has gotten older (mellower?), yes people change and try new things, blah, blah, blah. This CD, in my humble opinion, just lacks umph and is quite boring. I hate to say that because some songs are for her child (I think), but that isn't a reason to give a CD more stars than it deserves.I am and will always be a huge fan of Heather, but this effort just didn't do it for me."
5,Love it!,"I'm a huge Heather Nova fan. She's is really one of the most talented yet underrated and unheard of artists. I love all of her albums, however, this one is quickly becoming my favorite."
4,one among many,"She's a fine artist; her creativity in composition is good; her voice is crisp, clear and a bit sultry. She fits right in with all that other good talent out there....Joan Baez, Sheryl Crow and Stevie Nicks. I really like how she did ""Wicked Game."" It's why I bought the CD, specifically for that track. But I was not disappointed by her entire perfomance. You Go, Girl!"
4,"Like a good bottle of wine, Heather improves with time","With her unmistakable voice, Heather Nova shares with us another part of her universe filled with different emotions. The song ""I miss my sky"" is particularly powerful with a chorus that gives you a nice chill through your spine. I've been following Heather Nova since her album Oyster and even though this album doesn't have the raw energy of Oyster or Siren, it still has the Heather Nova trademark stamped on it. She has grown in maturity being now a mother and all this reflects on this album and shows us how a great artist Heather Nova is."
5,Great Reliable Scripture Bood,It so so good to find one of the old Bible learning books. They are out of print now and so hard to find. It was a great price and came quickly. Great packaging.
4,Decent truck anchors,"Product installed fairly easily. The tightening anchors are a little large for the port holes in my truck (2005 f-150) and were hitting the inner wall of the ports, so I had to install them slightly off center, but they still fully cover the holes. Overall these anchors seem pretty durable, and they keep the birds from building nests in my truck!"
5,Clean Humor,"It is unfortunate that this is Sinbad's only comedy CD, especially since he's done several HBO specials. Sinbad's brand of comedy is clean and many will find it extremely funny. This CD deals with things like Mike Tyson as a substitute teacher, spanking your kids, children in general, and more. The songs included didn't do anything for me, but that's just me.Bottom line: a worthy addition to any comedy collection!"
3,Sinbad CD,Got this for a friend. Love his TV specials and his humor. Better to watch on TV than listen to.
4,Sinbad's CD,I must not have read that this was a CD not a DVD. My fault! I think Sinbad's funny. He's not filthy or nasty and I can let my nieces and nephews enjoy it.
5,I Love Sinabd!,"As far as I am concerned, Sinbad can do no wrong. He is one of the best comics out there. He speaks the truth and stays away from vulgarity. I have all the Sinbad DVDs I can get my hands on. His material is timeleass. If you want to laugh til your cheeks hurt, treat yourself to Sinbad!"
4,mamamac,I loved this DVD! It arrived quickly and was reasonable cost wise. I always check amazon first when ordering online.
2,"Sinbad, Brain Damaged","I very was disappointed with this Cd, I thought I was getting a DVD. I notice that there was not a large selection of Sinbad stand-up."
3,Strong but roll over easily,"The product is made from one piece steel bar, so it is quite strong and does not bend while pushing-up. The foam grip handle provide enough cushion to keep my hands comfortable during the exercise. It is height adjustable based on the bar orientation. However, the height adjust feature is where the problem come in.When you set the height at the ""medium"" or ""high"" position, the bar will tip over quite easily while pushing-up. The reason the bar roll over is because the foam grip handles are not permanently glued to the steel bar, and can be ""spin"" around the steel bars. So if the direction of push up force is not directly vertical to the ground but angled a bit to the side, you will twist the grip and cause one of the bar to tip over into the ""low"" position.Since the ""low"" position if the only position that offers the most stability, you might as well just save a few bucks and purchase a regular U shaped push-up bars."
5,Solid Steel!,"These are extremely sturdy made from metal, no plastic at all. Not plastic like the other ones in this price range. Also can change height."
4,Leaves you wanting to listen to more!,The only fault that I would lay gently on this album is that it has only four tracks. I could have listened for hours if music of this calibur continued to play. I think this band will go far.~Charlie Will
2,For completists only.,"I bought this CD when it was first released. It's been that long since I heard it (since I sold it after only three listens) so I warn you that I'm going on memory here...I remember actually being surprised at the lack of cohesiveness on this set. It seemed to me that the band struggled and never really gelled into a groove. At the risk of sounding harsh, I'd say that this set runs a close second to ""Steal Your Face"" as the ""Least Greatest GD Live Release Ever"" (although I admit, I've never heard the Dylan collaboration).No, WOAN is not ""horrible"" by any stretch; It's just missing too much of that ethereal something that makes the Dead special. Espeacially with all the great live material available these days, I'd advise fans to buy almost everything else before this one."
5,I am stunned,"Wow. What an adventure. As promised the author delivers the goods with a book that does not attack ALL black women so much as he attacks the new generation of black people who he says are destroying themselves. It is hard, no bs, to the point tough love for arrogant black women, who fit into a certain category. I am stunned by the controversial negative and almost racist replies on web sites from some African American readers. I understand the author receives loads of negative emails daily, and most from people who haven't read a page fo this book! Get it and read it before judging it."
5,American Idol Rocks with This Book,"Being a huge Idol fan I love this book!! It has a ton of pictures, bio's, behinde the scense stuff and ton's of other stuff. I love this book!! Being a a fan of American Idol and completly obssesed this really helps bring along American Idol where ever I go. Also if someone hasn't seen the show you can show them the book and then they can sort of know what the whole seaon was like. Great guide and book for and handy for American Idol fans/freaks."
3,What about season 2???,"A book on season 3! What happened to season 2? As good as season 3 was, season 2 was way better. I'm still waiting for books to come out for that season! And a dvd set too."
2,Not The Best,"The others did a great job of giving a review of the story line so I will just give you my opinion of this book. I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't feel the romantic connection between the two amin characters. I knew early on who the killer in the story was and there should have been an obvious connection when the hero of the story was trying to figure out who it was. I felt that both of the main characters where dim witted, immature and selfish."
3,pretty good!,"When I listen to the cd, I enjoy it...but its not one that I can listen to over and over again. The girls have absolutly amazing voices, but the music could be better. I am really looking forward to the future of Edens Crush! They could be really good!"
5,Pure enjoyment,"I thoroughly enjoy listening to the album from start to finish. Each song has meaningful lyrics that the listener can learn from, particularly with a song like ""No Drama"". Most importantly, the hard work the girls put into the album proves to people everywhere that if you want something badly enough, it could definitely happen."
4,Rising Stars!,"This CD will without a doubt provide these new Popstars fame and fortune! Their debut single, already, has rocketed the billboard charts and now, with the premiere of their first cd, the girls are bound to have more continuous hits! With catchy tunes like 'Let Me Know' and 'What's Good for the Goose' teenage fans will be reciting their lyrics like the alphabet!"
4,It's hard not to like them,"I really was against this whole popstars thing, I mean, a bunch of girls audition, and they are like 'planned' to be famous and make records and sell out concerts, what about all of those poor people struggling to get a deal? That was before the infectious pop of Eden's Crush got me. It may get you too. Keep your TVs off, and your radios tuned to AM. And if you can't resist, don't worry, these girls aren't as guilty a pleasure as you may think. They can sing, and their pop is a little more mature, and polished than most teen dream package groups. There's even a nod to those old enough to remember ol' Shelia E. with a cover of her song ""Glamorous Life."" But don't fight these girls, buy the CD, or else you'll never be able to rest until you have ""Get Over Yourself"" to sing along with. :)"
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!,"eden's crush is the best pop girl group in the world! i love get over yourself, no drama, and the rest were pretty good. i think anyone who likes pop should buy this. the lyrics r good, the music is great, and their voices are perfect. BUY IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT! thanx"
5,Eden's Crush ROCKs!,"This first album entitled POPSTARS (based off the hit TV series) contains all the necessary chart topping components and is sure to be a smash hit! These talented young women have worked hard on this album and it shows, they took what they had to work with and transformed typical bubble gum pop into a spicy latin flavored masterpiece! Eden's Crush is a unique pop-harmony group providing appropriate listening pleasure for all ages! These girls have staying power and this album is only the beginning! ROCK ON EDEN'S CRUSH!"
5,AWESOME DEBUT CD FROM THE POPSTARS,"I loved this cd the songs on it are great mix of slow and pop fast ones get it now ALL FIVE CAN SING not just one like in those other so called pop bands out right now thanks to the wb and london sire records for a great talent you have discovered out of ivette, rossana, maile, nicole, and ana maria"
2,Don't Buy This CD!,"This album reminds me why I never buy a CD just because I like one song by the artist. Besides the somewhat catchy ""Get Over Yourself,"" the rest of this album is poorly done and not very original."
3,Questinable,"These are the best singers from the Popstars show? Hmmmmmmmm....... Not very much talent competing, huh?"
3,Eden's Crush material lacking...,"Eden's crush is definately filled with talent. The girls all have beautiful voices and the attitude to take them where they long to be in the pop world. I am sorry to say that there are only two songs on this whole disc that are worth anything. The lead single ""Get over yourself"" and the first track on the disc ""what's good for the goose"" are the only ones that have staying power. We've all heard ""Get Over Yourself"" and we know that the song rocks. The one other song on the album that you may not have heard is ""What's Good for the Goose"" is a GREAT song penned by the Talented trio ""Wild Orchid"" The disc is worth purchasing for these two tracks but other than that... These girls are talented and deserve their shot ..."
5,I've Been Crushed by Eden's Crush,"I mean this was impressive! Only 3-4 months to create a hit CD and the product was sharp, tight vocals, with driving beats, postive lyrics, and a little bit of Latin Flava. Way to go girls! ""I Want To Be Free"" is the bomb, Chernoble, baby. Can't wait for more!"
5,VERY GOOD!!!!,"Eden's crush are the best!!!! Especially their song, Get Over Yourself....this song is to show that any girl can live without a guy...we can move on and get over ourselves.... Eden's crush are the best...i love them.....!!!! GO EDEN'S CRUSH!!!!!"
5,"Theres ""NO DRAMA"" with Edens Crush!","Edens Crush starts off with thier first album ""POPSTARS"", many people might be expecting the cheesy pop music many are used to, but that couldnt be farther from the truth! The album starts out with ""whats Good 4 the goose"" which was written by the super group WILD ORCHID. Other than ""Goose"", some highlights from the album include ""Get over yourself (goodbye)"" the first single. ""Love this way"" the power ballad that showcases Ivette, ""No Drama"" and ""Mil Palabras"" all seen on the show by the same name ""POPSTARS"". This album is a must have for any fan of R&B music as well as good music in general. These five ladies can sing, and although Nicole is shown on every track, all the girls have thier time to shine. so ""get over yourself"" and buy ""popstars"""
4,Some Great Stuff,"As an avid viewer of the Popstars tv show I was out to buy the CD the moment it was released. I was pleased to listen to some of the great arrangements of lyrics, harmonies, and music, but at times was somewhat dissapointed.The CD provides a somewhat well rounded sound. Some Hip-hop and R&B, a few slow ballads, and even a beautifully sung Spanish tune.I think that as a viewer of the show and actually getting to see the stress and hardwork to get the glitz and glam you can appreciate these girls so much more.Great job on this album and I hope to see something as good if not better next time"
4,EDEN'S CRUSH MAKES A PROMISING DEBUT!,"After having watched every episode of POPSTARS, I was so happy to finally purchase the full length album this morning. It is a pop treat from start to finish!! The gals all possess extremely strong voices with a lot of depth and character which is how they seem on the show and in interviews as people! They seem to be very grounded and wonderful women! The 4 highlights on the album are WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE GOOSE, ANYWHERE BUT HERE, LOVE THIS WAY, GLAMOUROUS LIFE and my absolute favorite track TWO WAY!!! That song is awesome!!!! And of course the song that started it all GET OVER YOURSELF! I look forward to watching this great group progress and continue the pop journey!!!"
5,One of my favorite CDs ever!,"I had considered buying Eden's Crush ""Popstars"" for a long time. I LOVED ""Get Over Yourself"" and thought they were cool, so I assumed their other songs would be good too. And of course I was right. This album is AMAZING! I haven't stopped listening to it ever since I got it. Literally, ever since I bought this CD two days ago, it's the ONLY CD I have listened to. And guess what - I'm not sick of it yet. The best songs on the album in my opinion are ""Let Me Know"", ""Get Over Yourself"", ""It Wasn't Me"", and MOST of all, ""Love This Way."" Everytime I hear ""Love This Way"" it gets stuck in my head It is a GREAT song. I recommend this CD to anybody. This is a great dance CD as well as an excellent karaoke CD! Eden's Crush is awesome!"
1,The founder of a Nation and a Dynasty,"I would like to respond to the previous review. William of Orange (also known as William the Silent) was a very prominent figure in the cessation of the Netherlands from the Habsburgian Empire. In Dutch history, he is the founder of the Orange Dynasty and a more important figure than any of his descendants William 2, 3, 4 or 5. The author tried to avoid confusion by adding a reference to his nickname ""William the Silent"".This book is a typical example of ""Orange propaganda"" and the single star for this book is well deserved."
5,action-packed tour de force that builds up to a truly explosive climax...,"""If you've never associated the saying ""When the going gets tough, the tough get going"" with women, see this gem of a movie from the last century (`Women in the Night'). It showcases our tougher properties like no other film I've seen in a long time. This movie is a credit to director William Rowland as well as to every woman who has ever wanted to rise above the weary label `the weaker sex'."""
1,"To Expensive, spent more $ on marketing then the cable itself","I Had Bought This In Bulk To Run A Home Theater Server, I Have a 5 Bedroom House With 3 Floors, I Had To Run Cabling From The Basement To The Server To The Gigabit Network Hub(I Got The 24 Port Vers,)I Was Hoping To Have All 10 Computers Connected To The Same Network As Well As THe Ps3,Wii,And The 3 Xbox 360s, Long Story Short, I Ran The Cable(I Went To A Electrical Engineering School) Thouought The House Walls, Installed And Capped The Wires, And Then I Was Shocked To Find That The Cable Had Paint Marks On It, Looking At The Remainder I Noticed That This Was No Isolated Incident And Found More Paint(White This Time), winded up using it to make a wimpy Wimax antenna"
5,Great CD.,I couldn't seem to find this cd anywhere...Amazon had it and I was lucky enough to choose the right dealer. Great price with a GREAT SOUND!
2,A One Hit Wonder -- Twice,"This one hit wonder from Maryland got a total of 30 minutes of fame. The first round came when ""Into the Night"" climbed to #11 on the US singles chart in the autumn of 1980. Nearly nine years later a second set of 15 minutes rolled his way when the same version became a hit all over again peaking at #20 in the summer of 1989. (An attempt by Mardones to cash in on this second chance be rerecording the song failed when that version did not chart).The song can be something of a guilty pleasure if you don't pay too much attention to it. It kind of sounds like either a third rate Springsteen knockoff, or an actually halfway decent Meat Loaf tune (not that such an animal exists, mind you). That almost surreal cross turns out to be the song's undoing though, as it causes you to pay closer attention at which point you realize it is about a grown man lusting, and rather openly I might add, over a 16 year old girl and you end up with major case of the creeps."
1,Absolutely don't....,"This book is just a celebration of Lien Ying Kuo.Asolutely too much pages for celebration with family and relatives photos.Just something (really something...) general and elementary instruction on tai chi practice.The form.Do you know the kind of tai chi book where the form is described with just a big picture on each page and with only the name of the posture? That's it.Probably this book could have a very high emotional value for the pupills of Lien Ying Kuor (as it would also be for me if I were his pupill)but, absolutely, no any ""Tai-Chi Chuan in Theory and Practice"" in this book neither in theory nor in practice."
4,An interesting look at tai chi,"Kuo's book on tai chi chaun is an interesting look at his style of the martial art. The text of the book seems to be drawn mostly from the tai chi classics, though organized through the author's own understanding of the art. The photos included are good, and illustrate the postures of his tai chi form. This book also contains a brief introduction to Chinese philosophy as it relates to tai chi, which is useful for readers new to the subject. This book is not a training manual, but more of an overview of the style of tai chi practiced by the author."
3,Not a Tai Chi instruction book,This is not a book for the beginning student. The illustrations are vague and the postures lack detailed descriptions. It would be of interest to the Tai Chi book collector. It is more an immortalization of master Lien-Ying than a primer in the art of Tai Chi.
4,Great Book on Kuo!,"While it is not an instruction book on T'ai Chi it does cover a lot of the philosophy of Taoism and the fascinating life of Sifu Kuo.If you are looking to learn all 64 forms he taught I would suggestThe Healing Art of Tai Chi: Becoming One With Natureby Martin and Emily Lee. They were students of his and the book is much more detailed on the postures.Another book of theirs isRide The Tiger To The Mountain: Tai Chi For Health (Portable Stanford). While it has less forms it extremely detailed, making it great for beginners."
3,Not one size fits all,"These shoes were WAY too big for my child to wear with her Tinkerbell costume - they are not ""one size fits all"". But they will be okay for her to wear as slippers around the house once she grows into them. THey are very soft. THe bottom is not sturdy for outdoor trick or treating - they may be ruined after one wear. But indoors for play should be okay."
2,One Size Fits all a Joke,I bought these slippers for my 3 1/2 year old grandaughteras they stated one size fits all for 3 years and up ...WellUp is the key word .....These slippers could fit a girl from8 to 10 years old ......Very misleading !!!
2,one size = too big,"The slippers are cute but they are way too big for a four year old - even a big four year old. They do have a non-skid bottom, which will be good if she can ever keep them on her feet."
2,PAPERTHIN BUT STOOD THE TEST OF TIME,"While this product cannot be described as traditional ballet slippers as they are paperthin. They have withstood the test of time. You cannot wear them in the street, they are made for inside use only and then only sparingly."
3,Comfortable Indoor Tinkerbell Slippers,"As other reviewers have noted, these are thin-soled and meant for indoor use. The emphasis is on ""slippers"" in the name. My daughter wears a size 12/13 and these fit her well. She'll probably be able to wear them for a year but no more than that."
2,Good for indoor use only,"We bought these shoes to go with our 4 year-old daughter's tinkerbell outfit for Halloween. Unfortunately the shoes are soft fabric with non-slip soles similiar to house slippers, so they cannot be worn outside - the sole is so thin that any object (stick, rock) would be felt on the foot."
4,Tinker Bell Ballet Slippers,"I got these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them; however, she quickly out-grew them. I would purchase these again."
2,One size fits most?? Ha!,"I bought these because it said the shoes were ""One size fits most"" for 3+. I figured they would be a little big but it should really say for 6+. These shoes are closer to fitting me than my three-year-old, and her feet are bigger than other girls in her class!"
3,This is NOT Crystal Method,"The artist on this album is Crystal THEORY, Amazon has it listed as Crystal METHOD."
5,Get this in your Cd player!,"All you neophytes out there! Stop listening to your Kenny Gs and Sanborns, it will only bring misery and pain to the ears of the beholder! Play this thing and soon you will dispose all that smooth sexy junk down to the thrash bin. And that's for sure."
3,clip,The clip is somewhat difficult to handle. To pull out phone from clip one is required a lot of strenght on fingers... or use the other hand. Otherwise liked the product (using another belt clip)
3,They are fine,"Nothing bad, nothing special. they are finger puppets and what you would expect from finger puppets."
4,Entertaining,Bought this for my 2 year old to keep her entertained while out and about. She plays with the pegs taking them out putting them back in again. Holds her attention quite well!
5,His mission: assasinate his alternate self,"The first in the adventures of Colonel Brion Bayard and the Imperium. The Imperium is a force that keeps parallel universies in check from their own world in Zero Zero Stockholm. When war faces the Imperium from an alternate reality they find their only chance in traveling to our ""earth"" and finding the duplicate of the person who leads the army of the attacking universe. Enter Brion Bayard. In order to ensure that his world and the Zero Zero line can remain in existance he must go on a thrilling adventure and assasinate his alternate self. Sequels include: The Other Side of Time, Assignment in Nowhere, and Zone Yellow."
4,The 1962 ace double novel version.,I have not read any other editions of this novel other than the 1962 Ace Double Novel edition.Worlds of the Imperium is a classic story of alternate worlds and what one man must face when confronted by his alternate self. A short but nicely done story that heralded Laumer's later works.
3,Not much new here,"I view this CD as somewhat of a rip-off. As a new release, under his own name, I expected all new music, but instead found out that about half of them are on the Hotel Costes series, which I already own. Of the ""new"" material, I find it either just so-so or flat out bad. If it weren't such a hassle I'd return it. The three stars are for those songs which I found good on the previous Costes CD's, otherwise it would be a ONE star review."
3,Good tips but formatting makes it hard to read.,I really liked the tips but it was difficult to read because of the text going different ways. I agree that you should do most of your cleaning when you have the most energy.
1,"In a word, frustrating.","I went ahead and spent the extra money for a nice tire guage to use on my vehicles. I'm sure this guage is accurate, but it is a real pain in the rear to use. Hit the button to turn it on and it takes about 3 seconds before you can place it on the stem to check the pressure. The reading appears and stays on for way more than long enough to see it. If you have to let some air out of the tire, you will have to shut the thing off and restart it and go through the whole startup process. I guess it is comparable to starting up your computer and waiting for all the startup programs to do their thing before you can get on the net. Mine will be on eBay soon."
1,Way too awkward to be usable for Presta valves but some good points,"This gizmo could make you nuts. There is a mechanism that retracts for presta valves, the only problem is it doesn't retract smoothly so you end up letting out a lot of air before it is in the correct position. I have a gauge that cost half the price that I like much better for low pressure. A real disappointment for high pressure (80 to 125) psi pressure checking, however, the accuracy is very very good once you handle it correctly. If you want one gauge for all applications, I guess this one could be for you but it is tricky. Another draw back is that the on-off button is placed in exactly the spot you grip the gauge."
1,Laughably terrible,"I thought I'd get a digital meter to use on my bike and motorcycle and this one was pretty affordable. I tried it out last night and it is unbelievable horrible. Getting it on an off a presta valve is a challenge and results in lots of air loss. (On a schraeder, it works much easier.) When checking multiple tires, you need to turn off the device and restart it. There is no simple ""reset"" button. The placement of the buttons makes it very easy to accidentally turn it off when you're trying to take a reading. This thing is being immediately returned."
1,A pig in a suit is still a pig,"This is a cheap, made-to-fail tire pressure gauge dressed up in a fancy shell, but the flashy marketing doesn't change the fact that this thing is crap.I have observed identical behavior to RaiderSixx. You can take another reading, but it will only change the if the pressure has *INCREASED* which is pretty much useless.I used mine for about a year and three months (just outside the warranty period) before it failed altogether (it now permanently reads a unit-less ""77""). Absolute junk. I can't believe what is being charged given that a $10 digital tire pressure gauge from O'Reilly Auto is likely just as (if not more) durable with a better user experience."
1,Doesn't work,"The first problem with this gauge is that the one I received would only register 0.0 lbs on schrader valves, I didn't try it on presta valves. The second problem is that the ON button would constantly be ON if you tossed it in a bag or pack. It's not protected by a bezel and switches on with the slightest pressure. And finally, it comes in the type of tough plastic packaging - with rivets no less - that you need sharp implements and brute force to get into."
1,big dissapointment,"Bought this at the local shop on the recommendation of 2 people there. The first one I had to bring back because it did nothing, they exchanged it and against my better judgment after reading all the bad amazon reviews, I stuck with it. I was quickly disappointed in its performance but waited too long to return it so I am stuck with it. I have a VERY hard time hooking this gauge up to a presta valve without dumping loads of air from the tire. I have resorted at times to using a shraeder adapter which this gauge works more easily with, but is obviously very inconvenient and ridiculous to need to do. If I ever can get this thing to work without dumping half the pressure THEN the stupid slow response/startup time, and need to reset for a second reading are absolutely infuriating. DO NOT BUY THIS GAUGE!If you still think it looks good insist to try it at the store or make sure you can return it if you are with the majority that regret buying this."
2,Goofy and hard to use. Not worth the purchase price.,Not worth the purchase. Stick with your floor or hand pump. Bought to use on a mountain bike. Overkill.
1,Topeak deflator,This IS the worst item I have purchased in years1- It gave 1 reading in 20 attempts...15.5psi when the actual was 120psi2- It deflated all tires <30psiThis item demonstrates a need for an IMMEDIATE embargo on Taiwanesse importsAnyone who purchases this gauge is a FOOL..& should have his credit card privileges suspended pending a competency evaluation
5,"crazy-funny-cool trivia, plus a $10,000 prize!","this book totally captures the funny, irreverent, goofball and just plain out there spirit and personality of yoyodyne, from the days when the online promotions company was all about making people laugh out loud while they played e-mail and web games. a collector's item for true fans, and a great resource for party facts for everyone else."
3,good but extensive,that is not the book any starting investor want to dig in....contains very sophosticated details......I would recomend a simpler book with a cheaper price .
2,One word.........BORING,This is by far the worst business book I have ever owned. I could hardley make it half a page without my mind wandering. It needs more real life examples to make it more appealing and understandable to the layperson.
4,Student Use.,The text book is well written and well organized. One concern is the preface. It depicts a website for the book indicating availability of student resources including an Investment Analysis Calculator. The web site has changed and the publisher has acknowledged that there are no student resources available.
4,Excellent review of all possible finance instruments,"It is a text book vs a simple reading book, however the author has done an excellent job of presenting the concepts in simple to understand format. With well writtem text and informative graphs the concepts easy to understand. Covers all types in investments instruments from stocks, bonds, options, futures and portfolio construction."
3,Watch Out for CengageNOW Add On,"Bought the book off Amazon instead of the campus bookstore. HOWEVER, the campus bookstore had bundled their book with the CengageNOW online study tool, which cost me another $69.99 seperately so I could do the online course assignments. Just double check what is needed beforehand. Nowhere in my course syllabus was the online study tool noted as being required."
5,All your base are belong to us.,I like turtles. This is an album of music. It is good. I like to listen to good music. Goodbye.
3,Good overview. Short on detail,"If you just want a quick, broad overview of cryptography in the American Revolution then this book should suffice. It was compiled by the Army Signal Corps in 1945 so obviously there is nothing discovered after that included here. Also, as stated in the foreword, there was no original research done in the preparation of this book; it is based on other works, 3 of which appear in the 3 appendixes. Serious Revolutionary War cryptography scholars should turn their attention to the Ralph Weber book, ""American Diplomatic Codes"" for a much more in-depth analysis."
1,Zero Stars!!!,"If I could rate this product less than one star I would!!!I received this product as a gift. The screen burned out within several months. I sent it back to the company and they replaced it. Now the replacement has burned out as well.The response from the company representative , Roger Maddron Jr, was ""We've found that users who run their units 24/7, will encounter backlight issues more frequently. We recommend around 8-10 hours of continuous use a day.""What a pain to have to turn the unit on and off. What's the point of having a digital picture frame if you can't enjoy it anytime of day.Also, after the original 1 year warranty (from original purchase) expires, you are left with a worthless unit.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"
1,could not be more dissapointed,"I'm ashamed I have to give it 1 star, but you can't give it 0 I quess. I first bought the product as a gift for my wife. When we took it out of the box it did not work as the screen appeared not to turn on, but after looking really hard at the screen we saw it was about 1% lit up and so dim that we couldn't even tell it was on. So we returned for another. 3 months later this one has the same problem. Very dissapointing and cheap product as the images looked terrible from up to about 3 feet away when it did work. Also, there is no way to turn it on or off while it is in it's 'frame'. Finally, the power plug adapter fit the unit very poorly and barely wants to stay plugged in. Do yourself a favor and avoid this product."
1,Don't Buy This Product,The screen burns out after about 1 year of use. The company told me I was out of luck since it was after a year (by about 2 weeks) and that I would have to buy another one. Don't waste your time with this product.
1,Screen goes BLACK AFTER A FEW MONTHS,"I got my first one for Mothers day last year, and I thought it was great. Well, two months down the road the screen went black, you could not see anything. So I found the receipt for it and brought it back and exchanged it for another one. Now the newer one has done it again. As soon as I find the receipt it's going back. It was only $80 at Wal-Mart, I will go to and electronics store and try a better one."
1,LCD is dead after 5 months,The LCD screen is dead. It is not showing anything. It is not a good product.
4,Photoshare Digital Photo Album - Review,"-Easy to load files and operate. Great resolution on the photos. Don't feel they should advertise video playback features of this product as they do not work unless you own a software capable of rendering .mjpg files. (Otherwise common .mpg and .avi file formats DO NOT PLAY!) Overall, pleased with purchase!"
1,"Too risky, not worth the price","This was given to me as a gift. It was a very cool idea, and we enjoyed it for 3 months. Loading pictures is easy, and only a little common sense is needed to figure out the aspect ratios. Your pictures are really going to need to be manipulated in photoshop or some other editing software. You can't drop a 5mp photo straight from your camera, and shame on you for thinking you could. That is not the products fault. BUT....our frame quit working after 3 months. The backlight in the LCD is out. This product is a piece of junk....enough of the reviews back that claim."
1,Didn't work out of the box,"Junk. I plugged in the AC/DC adaptor - which was a tight fit, and the pin broke. Couldn't even use it. It does not come with a proprietary battery (additional cost item). Avoid this product."
2,Decent for price but burned out in 4 months,"I keep this frame on all day and night. The LCD backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned out.The quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res. is not good if viewing up close.There is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag. Regular LCD backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night. This one just lasted 4 months. So the image is almost non-existant now. In the glare, you can barely make out the image so it's still there but with no backlight so good as dead.I would recommend a more expensive Philips ones. My friend has had it for about two years and it's still going. plus it's higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips, which this one can't."
4,Top value for the money!,"I read all the previous reviews before purchasing this unit. Because of the low cost (hundreds less than most alternatives), I decided to go ahead. My wife and I love it! I did obtain the firmware upgrade and as far as we are concerned, it nicely fits photos into the frame without the stretching we and others have seen. I do not see any lack of yellow as noted above, and the pictures are detailed enough to allow the main objective (taking lots of photos along on a trip to share with friends) to be met. The OS is a bit slow, but, hey! it's under $100! I recommend this unit for an electronic replacement of photo albums... I have a 1G SD which is half full with every digital photo we have taken over the past 6 years! Definitely, get the firmware upgrade, though."
1,Do Not Buy This Frame,I bought this frame in Jan. '07 and the screen burned out March '07. I returned it and the newest one burned out last night - April '07. This product needs a redesign - the screens don't work for long.
1,I'm on my 3rd! Dont buy,"Everyone. I am on my 3rd Photoshare digital photo frame. My first one lasted about a month, then the backlight stopped working; i could still vaguly see the picture, there was no light behind it. I returned it to my local wal*mart (that's probally why they don't work. there roughly $100, and there sold at wal*mart. no offence), and got a new one. That one stopped working about 2 weeks in. Now, im on my 3rd. HOPEFULLY it will last. I called their customer support two times, and asked if there ment to be left on all the time, and both times, the lady said, ""yes, thats their purpos"". So i assume i just oddly recived two junky ones. Beware everyone!"
2,A nice puzzle. A poor frame.,"The PhotoShare should appeal to those who enjoy electronic games. Some have the aspect ratio option (16x9 or 4x3) and some don't. My first one (which failed after an hour) had the option, the replacement does not. Everyone and everything in the photos are a bit fat. By careful measurement, I determined that the pictures were about 33% too wide. I used MS Paint to shrink the width by 25% (stretch to 75%) and, lo and behold, the images look normal. I found a batch JPEG resizer (FastStone Photo Resizer) that does a batch real quick. In it, I resize the images to 1000x1000 with stretch. This makes the images look way skinny, but the PhotoShare stretches them to look normal.Further, the images are poor quality, the unit is slow. Seems to me that those recommending this product have simply found a challenging game that they have enjoyed beating. Don't give this to anyone that is impatient or mathematically challenged."
1,Rockbottom quality,"The only person who should buy this product is someone that wants the cheapest unit possible. Change the apsect ratio to 4:3 and use 640x480 pictures. It's a repurposed video display. Forget 7"" it is only about 5"" once you are at 4:3 which is the only usable setting unless you like spending endless hours. Forget the math. it will never work unless you don't mind your pictures being cropped. You will be dissapointed if you know anything about the words resolution or aspect ratio. They really could do better. Should cost $49."
1,Terrible picture quality and buggy firmware,"I just received one of these today. I was drawn to the nice leather frame (and it is nice). The picture quality, however, reminded me of an old videogame. The faces almost looked painted they had so little depth and detail, and the dots were still visible at 3 feet away.It's kind of a shame since this product has a lot of nice features (available batery for portability, nice frame, slideshow, folders, ability to use filename, etc.), but the PQ was just too terrible.Also, the model I received had a bug that made it freeze in the settings menu, requiring a reset. While the Photoco customer service rep had heard of the problem several times before, he had no workaround and told me to exchange the unit."
1,"False Advertising , it's not portable - requires you to purchase a special battery","Quite unsatisfied with this product and will be returning the 2 I purchased as gifts. In fact, the recipients asked me to return them. Main reason, in order for it to be ""portable"" it requires a special battery that you can only buy from the manufacturer for an additional $30. I already spent $100, not planning on spending more money. I think PhotoCo needs to rethink their product and improve customer satisfaction."
2,Not so great,The overall appearance looks nice. Picture quality sucks. The screen burned out after 2 years... guess I should be glad it lasted that long. I'm not.
1,didn't work when I got it,"Well I havent had a chance to see if my screen burns out like the other reveiws, I bought this for my wife for christmas, they were not available for shipping at that time so we recieved it Jan 14th. I followed directions & tried to load pictures onto the new SD card I bought ($20) & it wont let me add anything, says the disc (sd card) is write protected. bought another SDcard $20 maybe I got a bad one :/ nope same thing. both cards work good in my digital camera. it appears the photoshare 2.4 isn't seeing the position of the write protect tab on the sd cards. So now I'm guessing I'll have to ship it back ( more $$$)The screen after a minute or so of turning it on does go black but I'm hoping thats because there are no pictures loaded into it.So far I'm not too impressedCcRider"
3,Not great... Not Bad...,"So this was not a great product, but it was not a bad one. The frame and the viewer were a little bulkier than they could have been. Overall, I like the features that it has, but they were not executed in the best fashion but for the price....I have not really noticed the image size issue, all the pictures we put on it seemed to look correct.One important feature that it does not have is a sensor to automatically turn it off when no one is around or automatically turn off after a certain time. that would be helpful since LCD's loose their brightness the longer they are left on, so I do not want to leave this on all the time.Compared to what there is out there at this time, this is a good option, but I keep hoping that better and larger devices will continue to emerge."
5,The beginning of the end for MS...& other Diseases of Civilization,"Who doesn't know someone who is suffering from MS or other Diseases of Civilization? This is essential information that can change the quality of a lot of lives. Kudos to Dr. Monte. who has laid out a clear and engaging case for methanol being the Trojan Horse that is responsible for all this suffering. And as a food scientist, he lays out a few simple dietary rules to follow that will make all the difference for so many people. It's nice to see someone who clearly cares so much, yet gives the facts with such a detailed reference system to back up his persuasive findings. His dedication is surely mission driven. The truth about this stuff needs to get out to everyone. This could be the beginning of the end for MS & other Diseases of Civilization.Nicky Laman, Founding Sales Director, Discovery Toys"
5,He explains everything. Very detailed.,"He has very clear biological explanations, all referenced to research on the subject, and clearly explains why the methanol-multiple sclerosis hypothesis has been downplayed and overlooked by researchers from the time the disease was first discovered. This was a very insightful and convincing lecture on the methanol-multiple sclerosis hypothesis, to the point where I'm convinced it can be considered concluded."
5,About time we got some GOOD information,"Just finished this and it is outstanding. Everyone in the developed world should read/see it.I checked this Monte's credentials and he is everything he says he is. Also called some people to check him out and he's well known and respected in the field.I couldn't believe how much information he gave and kept in such a logical framework that I followed it easily. I did go back several times to make sure that he did say what I thought he said. I'm just not used to hearing the truth so unvarnished.It also is such a relief to find a bibliography at all, but this one is amazing. I have looked up about a dozen and they do indeed say what he says they do. Not always the case in technical writing with a point to make.This is one of the few works I've seen in quite some time that backs up the epidemiological associations with good wet chemistry cellular pathways to verify the causes."
5,Monte's free online article Dec. 2007 gives full text references for his video talk,"A medical layman, I've been active since 1999 as a conscientious volunteer information activist who provides online reviews of mainstream scientific research about aspartame (methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid) toxicity, as a public service.Prof. Monte provides the best summary of the research.His 145 minute DVD video presentation summarizes information explained in detail in a long article:Monte WC. 2007, A Deadly Experiment.Fitness Life. 2007 Dec.; 34: 38-42.[...]223 references with abstracts or full and partial texts"
3,Competent and useful bibliography.,"Interesting bibliography of 20th century ""gothic romances"". Published in 1979, so not a comprehensive look at the Twentieth Century.Most of the mentioned novels were romantic suspense paperback originals.The included annotations are rather subjective and opinionated. They are useful for a general idea of the various listed novels' subject content and the authors' writing skill.Alphabetical listings by the author's name. Some pseudonyms included.All in all, a helpful bit of publishing history."
4,Confusing,I find this book confusing. The commentaries and the text are on different pages and you have to refer back and forth.
4,Nice CD,"This is not the old ""traditional"" Greek songs you may have grown up with, but it's a nice CD. It's relaxing to listen to and has a nice little Greek flair to it. I don't absolutely love it; it's not in constant rotation in my CD player; nonetheless, I do enjoy it and I do listen to it sometimes to unwind. I can't say there is anything wrong with this."
5,Had to Tell Somebody,"I received an autographed copy of this book as gift from for cousin (yeah her name is in the author's thanks), and put it aside to read later. Once I picked it up, I found I couldn't put it down. Just when I thought I had it figured out, new twist would developed. Found myself routing for some characters and hating others, at times wanted to crawl between the sleeves and knock out a few of them. I became one with the book. I called my cousin and asked her to please tell Lori, that this is one of the greatest books that I have read, and then called my local library and told them that they just had to have a copy for the patrons to read. If you don't have time to just sit and read, don't start this book, believe me you will not get anything done until you finish it."
5,"This book had interesting characters and a unique ""hook.""",The writer did a terrific job of keeping the characters interesting enough and giving them all a secret that you just had to keep reading about until the end! A pleasurable summer read. I hope the author is working on something new for next year.
5,Captivating...and keeps you reading,"This story was great. It took all I could muster up not to finish this story in one day. Yes, I dragged it out because I didn't want the book to end. I knew the faster I flipped, the closer I came to the end. So I took my time. And believe me, I was not disappointed. I feel that every character that played a part in this novel was well developed, had there own personality, and they were all believable. Doug was a bit too corny for my taste, but he was still believable because there are sweet guys like that. Jack was too arrogant, but then, guys like that exist, also. But my point is lies catch up with everyone, and they affect others like a deadly virus. By reading this novel, I bet people who do have a lie they are holding in, are tempted to let it out. I'm not lying when I say that I am waiting for your next novel!!"
5,Excellent!,"I really, really enjoyed reading every word in this book. I recommend this book to every person who has a dream to fulfill ...Enjoy!"
5,I COULDN'T PUT THE BOOK DOWN,I'M THE PRESIDENT OF 5SISTAH AND A BOOK BOOKCLUB AND WE PICKED YOUR BOOK DUE TO IT WAS YOUR FIRST AND WE ALL ENJOYED IT SO MUCH WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO GIVE US MORE. SO KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK AND WE WILL KEEP UP OUR SUPPORT.
4,Loved the book!,"Actually, not a review. Just found out that Lori is next-door neighbors with my cousin and he has heard her speaking about getting this book publsihed for 5 years!! I am trying to ensure that my comments are received by her personally. How can I send an email directly to her? Please forward this to her to let her know that ""Larry Gelfand's"" cousin wants to contact her. I am at ""bradleyw@utm.net"" Thank you for your assistance"
3,Read Between The Lies,"Felicia, Stephanie, Bea, and GabrielleFour women and one long story to tellDeception, love, secrets, and liesCharacters you like, characters you despiseYou've read it before, you'll find nothing new,I give it 2.5 stars, what say you?"
2,"Blah, Blah, Blah....",I didn't really like this book it was too slow! I would not recommend it to readers who have a short attenion span like myself.
4,GREAT BOOK,"I really enjoyed this book, it was a great first novel. I could not put this book down. This is a must read. Pick it up ASAP!"
3,Almost Worth the Wait,"I had been waiting for this book from the publisher for over half a year. While it has many helpful details on the nature of additives and why they would be used, and the application of plasters to different substrates, with emphasis on covering straw bale homes, there are no recipes. This really disappointed me, as I believe I could have figured out how to hold a hawk and trowel, and really, anyone building all or part of their house will likely have passed the point of getting useful information out of the first 84 pages by the time they get to need some eductation on plasters. Hopefully, a saving grace will be the resource guide in the back, but access to that could have been obtained by borrowing it from the library."
5,Cute,"I purchased this for my sister, and she was delighted with it! She is making cookies for Christmas using this adorable cutter. Great price, and it arrived quickly!"
2,Mosquito net hat,"Handy to slip on for quick trips outside, no tying needed. Hat rim and hoop need to be bigger to keep net off of skin."
3,Chris Leo? Must be related to Ted Leo...,"Because Let The Formula Forge Itself Fantastic is almost note-for-note Ted Leo's ""St. John The Divine"". I prefer his older brother's version. But there's some decent stuff on here. That ""Mega-Hang"" song is pretty cool. I haven't heard the original song yet, but then again I haven't heard everything from Ted Leo yet either."
3,Ok Care Bears Movie,My girls weren't very interested in this movie. They preferred the newest Care Bears Wish a Lot instead of this.
5,its our favorite,as my 7 year old said last night it is my favorite big grown up tv show. i can t say it any better only thing i would love is if you could watch it from the site even if you dont have cable.
4,How did I live without TNT?,"Well, it was hard, let me tell you. Mainly because I had to do without Rizzoli and Isles. I love Tess Gerritsen's books and, while these aren't quite comparable, these two have great chemistry together and I definitely love the relationship. I'm so glad these are available on Amazon because I can't watch TNT on line because they require your cable provider information. Great show, good science, good mysteries and characters you actually like."
5,Girl Time,"I love a show with powerful, smart, witty and intelligent women. Thanks for the laughs ladies. This is a treat at the end of a long work week."
4,The girls always deliver,"This was a great episode, but a little difficult to remember the build from the previous episode as it was spaced far from the previous episode (over 3 months). I recommend watching closer together."
5,Welcome to the dollhouse,This is one of my favorite shows. I now have a Kindle Fire and realized that I can download the shows I have missed! Love it!
5,LOVIN' RIZZOLI & ISLES,"I love the mystery series, I love the girls' inter action and the family members as they show up on the scene. I love it that I can watch R & I whenever I click on Amazon.com and can purchase any of the episodes I want. THANK YOU, AMAZON.COM!!"
1,"""No More Rizzoli and Isles""","I was a fan of Rizzoli and Isles until Episode 14, ""Over, Under"", I'm not anymore. in fact I'm thru with it. I'm not buying anymore episodes. They want to use a quality program such as this and ruin it by trying to turn it into some kind of brain washing propaganga crap. I'm no homophobic, but I still can do without this kind of business. I'm done with Amazon instant video, and Rizzoli and Isles. This doesn't even deserve one star."
3,Confusing for the finale,"I found this episode very confusing and viewed it 3 times to try and find the missing info. First I didn't remember that the killer had been raised from the dead, second, with all the murders in NY - how could Rizzoli remember that the killer had a certain type of drug in his system, third, it never mentioned anything about Lydia having the baby after she had labor pains, 4th, how did Rizzoli know it was Lydia's baby if there was no note which she didn't even remember. If someone left a baby on my doorstep, someone I knew that would not be my reaction that Jane had, calm - happy.... This was a very disappointing finale."
3,Like the show BUT......,"I really enjoy the show but I'm sick of Rizzoli personal life....its not interesting. Season 3 episode 14 could ave been so much better, Rizzoli is supposed to be a strong woman with a can do attitude but when it comes to Casey she drops the ball. If she wants to be with him then tell him, in fact demand it. I think that would make for a better dynamic. I'm sick of her feeling sorry for herself."
5,Love This Show,"My Kids and I ages 15 & 19 watch this show together, it is fun, entertaining and not too gory and bloody as some shows are. They deal with all kinds of criminals and situations and do it suspensefully with entertaining characters. We look forward to each new episode and this is by far our favorite crime show."
5,Great. Show,My wife and watch this show together.We never gave any issues with the quality... And we love the show
2,As time goes by - disappointing,"I loved the first season of Rizzoli and Isles. As time goes on the show has lost its edge, the two leads are becoming characitures of what they were in year one - in short, the show has become kitzch - in a bad way. Won't buy any more episodes."
5,dirty little secret,i recently purchased this episode of this hit series and i thought that the episode was very good.this episode was suspensful and had some good action and some sense of humor.anybody who loves this show and dose'nt have this season of this show on dvd should purchased this and other episodes of this show it is worth it. chrisfan.
2,Just couldn't get into it,"Just couldn't get into it. There are much better police shows out there. Rizzoli says Cop 101 phrases constantly - ""serial killers are mostly men"" Oh really? Gee I didn't know that. And the blonde girls' mom just happens to work at the coffee shop IN the police station?! How stupid and contrived is that? Anyway, Rizzoli and Isles sounds like it'd be better as a cook book"
5,Great Series,There's not much to say about Rizzoli & Isles except I really like the series and have since it first came out. It's based on books written by Tess Gerritsen and I've read all of her books on Rizzoli & Isles before the series came out and really enjoyed them. That's the reason I started watching the show. I find the TV series better than the books and I can't say how much I really enjoy the series. It definatly rates 5 stars!
3,"Too much ""hissing and spitting""",This is the first I have ever watched this program. I thought there was too much arguing and not enough real action. I will watch a couple more to see if this improves.
2,Dumb and Dumber,"This show is really silly. Cliched, predictable. All the jokes are cheap jokes. The two main characters do a good job with what they're given and thus, it's watchable in small doses if you keep your expectations low."
1,NO ON THIS SERIES,VIDEO WAS TERRIBLE PHOTOGRAHY WAS BAD SOUND WAS OFF I NEVER REALLY GOT INTO STORY BECAUSE THE VIDEO QUALITY WAS BAD
2,Could be so much better,"Simplistic and silly throwing everything in but the kitchen sink: paralysis, collapsing concrete, organ donor, love then not relationship, homosexuality, tunnels and crackling buildings. If this episode doesn't have it, it doesn't exist I guess. Not well plotted, written or acted. Melodrama instead of ""No More Drama"" in 43 minutes."
5,Prince is back like Star Wars!!!,"""U Make My Sun Shine"" is the most typical Prince R&B ballad ever. It's appallingly boring, for Prince. On the other hand, ""When Will We B Paid?"" is a magnificent soundscape of heart-felt conviction. How could anyone complain about lack of sauce? Prince ain't been this tangy in a long time...a long time."
4,the human side of the battle of gettysburg,"On The Bloodstained Fields Of Gettysburg....an excellent read for those interested in the human side of battle.The supposed and imagined ""Glory of War"" takes a well deserved beating in this interesting book about the great Battle of Gettysburg.The short stories of wars horror will cause one to appreciate the tradgedy that occured on this hallowed ground.A good little book that puts a human face on the great conflict that happened in this Pennsylvannia town.It made me think...."

4,Demolishing the Myths,"No matter you agree or disagree with some of the arguments of the author, 1908 Revolution, in terms if its historical depth and academic quality, overshadows many other books on Ottoman-Turkish history and provides a refreshing and thought-provoking account. Challenging both the methodologies and central arguments of conventional studies of Turkish politics, which were highly dominated by ultra-conservative modernization school, this book is of special importance not only for the students of the late Ottoman period, but also for all of the the students of Turkish politics."
5,A Mother's Love Never Fades,"As a hispanic man I enjoy books that celebrate cultural diversity and lifelong learning. Although the author Judith Kan is an Asian woman, I feel as if I can relate to the hard won advice she gives her daughter in Essays From the Heart. My wife died two years ago and won't be able to see our daughter graduate this year. It breaks my heart not only because I miss my wife, but because my wife and daughter were so very close. I gave Essays From The Heart to my daughter as an early graduationm gift. She says that when she read it she was flooded with memories of time spent with her mother. She felt as though her mother was there, ever so gently helping her make important decisions for her future. At a time when a daughter needs a mother most, Judith Kan has given us a gift that will last a lifetime. Thank you so very much.Jesus Garcia"
5,when you listen to it you feel like in heaven,"with this record she shows the world that she is the voice of all time, i love her much, and i hope you do the same!"
5,This is the ONE time that Whitney Houston sings!,I've heard Whitney Houston scream most of her songs but this is the ONE time that she truly sings. Her vocals are wonderful in this song.
1,Pitiful,"Gosh! She is SO OFF KEY on the chorus! If my new CD player wasn't new, i would've SMACKED IT! The song is way overplayed, and it's a cool song, but I don't think Whitney should've sung it. She is too old, and her voice is just REALLY off..."
5,Great for dog liver problems.,"My dog had really elevated liver enzymes. This product played a major role in getting her blood tests back to normal levels. In small bottles, it gets pricey, so I have been happy to be able to buy it in bulk. I keep it in the fridge, as this bottle lasts over a year."
3,toward the africa revolutions,I already received and this product is very good. I suggest for all people interest in anti-colonizing and politics action
5,On time,Received item in reasonable time and in immaculate condition. Still awaiting the right time to read book.
4,The ballads are superb but...,"Will Downing's second CD was his most eclectic and versatile as he covers everything from jazzy ballads to hard-hitting New Jack Swing dance tracks. The simply gorgeous Quiet Storm ballads ""I'll Wait"", ""The Love We Share"", ""Too Soon"", ""Test Of Time"" and his simply mesmerizing and jazzy remake of Rose Royce's ""Wishing On A Star"" are all superb but the dance tracks don't do his voice or talents justice."
3,"The info is there, but the index needs alot of work.",I had to create my own index for this book. There is alot of useful info in there but if you can't remember where you saw the info you were looking for forget even looking up the index. Its as good as if it was not there. A quick example - You are using ADO object and you remember that you can create a UDL file which has all your connection data. Try to look up the index and find the related information on hwo to use UDL files. Bet you can't find it. There is alot more but I'm sure amazon has a limit to on line reviews.
4,Suprisingly good reference!,"At the risk of agitating the Microsoft haters out there, I found this to be an excellent resource for beginning to intermediate users. Very good sections on basic programming and a generally readable style. Only shortcoming I've discovered is the total lack of reference to ADO."
1,VB 6.0 Programmers Guide not for programmers,"If you are a programmer and looking for a good guide and/or reference, do not buy this book! The examples are few and not very good. The book does not go beyond VB in explainations, or lead you to additional reference material. Don't waste your money."
4,A very good book to learn VB 6,I bought this book a few days ago and I just can't put it down. This book would definitely help those who are planing to take the Visual Basic 6 exams.
2,A waste of money,This book is the on line help in print. Don't waste your money if you have MSDN files installed!
3,Good Book For Newbies,"This book is only good for people who just got VB 6.0 for the first time and are new to programming. Other than that I would not recommend this book to anyone of moderate to advanced level because this book is just a reprint of the online help included in the MSDN files. Bottom-line, good book for beginners to have it in text, however anyone who has a grasp for programming I would not recommend it."
4,A great addition to my library,This was an very good book. I thought it had a lot of good information. that the other books I have do not. I used it to study for the Desktop Exam and passed. This is also a great refernce as well as a learning tool.
3,Not for Newbies,"If your a newbie to Visual Basic do not buy this book! This book in geared towards the intermediate to advanced programmer I have been using VB for several years and take it from me, don't buy it. Even for the intermediate programmers this book makes numerous references to the Library Reference, If your serious on vb then get it too otherwise don't bother, try a website."
3,Ambitious But Not Outstanding; 3.5,"This is an ambitious attempt to produce a combined psychological novel and Chandleresque mystery novel. As with all Chandler-type novels, the hero is an alienated individual seeking some kind of truth in a corrupt milieu. In this case, the corrupt milieu is an Eastern European Communist state. This is not an original version of the Chandler idea, Martin Cruz Smith did this fairly successfully in Gorky Park and Phillip Kerr has a series of good PI novels set in Nazi Germany. Steinhauer attempts to combine this style of mystery novel with psychological exploration of the effects of totalitarian rule. This attempt is not successful. Steinhauer is a decent writer but presently lacks the skill to bring off a complicated task like this. The mystery per se suffers from excessively complex plotting and characterization is only moderately good."
3,"If you guys don't mind, I'll do a review on the book","It seems awfully fascinating how customers have only reviewed the ""seller"" and ""shipping"" of the book rather than the actual content of Criminology by Siegel.In any case, I've been using this for my Theories of Crime and Delinquency class at SJSU.It's a very dense book, I must say first off. It covers a lot of material in a seemingly short amount of time, but it's a very detailed and enlightening book. In an almost narrative an interesting format, since the author seems to be talking to you in a very colloquial tone. I enjoyed that.However, I felt that a lot of the material could be cut down as well, as there was too much information to navigate through to understand the core concepts. For me, if I understand the core concepts, I'm pretty much set. At times, the material seem to wander off.Overall, this isn't the worst textbook ever published. It's a fairly decent read. But it could be better."
5,One of the Best on the Market,Siegel's Criminology texts are among the very best. You cannot go wrong if you select this book for your class. My only concern is the rate at which newer editions are published. Not that much changes in the field to justify so many books each year. The core content of theory stays the same.
2,disappointed,"The book was what i wanted and has everything in it i need the only thing i was disappointed in as a college student was the fact is says :NOT FOR SALE IN THE UNITED STATES"" in big writing on the front cover so i cant sell the book back."
1,Legend of the what?,"Let me tell you, this movie had to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. it was no ""bog body"" roaming around killing. It actually looked like Popeye the Sailor. My suggestion to all is to steer totally away from this Vinnie Jones flop. Pick up either The Condemned or The Midnight Meat Train instead. Way better movies. Sorry Vinnie it just plain sucked!!!!! This would have got a zero star rating if I could have done it."
1,This was halarious!,"This was a funny movie! At least a half dozen times, I laughed so hard, I could barely breathe. Three groups of two people end up in the same small cabin or shack. You have people talk about death stories, one taxi driver guy saying ""he was driving some girl somewhere, got mad because she didn't have the money, so he threw her out. Then 40 miles later, he hears this thumping. It was her, being dragged along the side of the car. he said, I guess her coat got stuck when he closed the door. HAH AHAH! How can you get your coat caught in the door, and not open the door or tell the driver, who by the way, is the one who opened the door to throw her out, to say, hey, don't go, I am caught.The hunter saying, I tried to protect this guy, then at the next frame you see the flashback of him shooting the guy, HAHA HAHA!! FUNNY film. Oh my, what a funny show. You have to make fun of it. It's the only way to enjoy it. Many more funny moments.Well worth the one dollar rental at Red Box."
3,EH,"Well, it wasn't THAT bad. But not that good either. I just happen to like Vinnie Jones. Plus it's pretty cool to see the then, future WWE Champion Sheamus in something other than wrestling."
2,TOJ JOHNSON ALIVE AND WELL,"If you loved watching bad movies with someone who looks like Toj Johnson, try this one out. The movie never really got scary, unless you are a midget clown. The bog monster isn't frightening and the shower scene was rated G. I will say that the people in this movie tended to be have more character than in normal one star productions. The rude American was almost funny at times, calling the cab driver, ""McDuff, Gilligan and Darby O' Gill."" There seems to be a lot of cows on the road in Ireland. More comedy than horror."
1,LOW BUDGET CRAP !!!!!!!!!!,This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time . Stay away from this low budget crap . It is no worth 1 star . Waste of money and time .
4,Acceptable,"Was a little slow in arriving and condition was acceptable. it was a little rougher than expected but the shipper did not list as ""Like new"". I would use this seller again."
3,"Ok, but...","This book started off really good. The battle with Superman vs Doomsday was pretty cool. However, too many supermen spoil the story. Gets kind of dopey. Superman dies, then all the sudden You've got a cyborg superman, a cloned superboy, a renegade superman, and a guy in a metal suite (""Man of Steel"")... it's just too many and the story kind of loses focus.There's no explanation of where Doomsday comes from other than he was buried, in chains and breaks out. There're clues that he might be a genetics experiment gone bad, but they don't really go into it.It's a decent read, just not great."
3,not anything to be exicted about,As much as I love Superman. This book was a real disappointment in my opinion. The beginning of the story is real good but when he dies it's like the book got soo boring to read that I just wanted to skip through the pages just to read about he's resurrection and what will he do next. But when I got to he's resurrection I wanted to burn the book!! Because it was more of a disappointment. I was real hoping that Doomsday would come back alive to pick the story up but a little to late. This book could have been a great book if Doomsday was resurrected as when Superman was! It was just boring.
2,Not what I expected,"I recieved this book expecting a ""very good"" condition book with the dust cover included becasue the description said nothing of the dust cover missing. But when I recieved the book it was missing the dust cover, and they were lacking in telling me they were going to tape on the order directly to the book with packing tape. Doing this directly ruined one side of the book because in order to remove the tape some of the cover came off with it. NOT very professional to do this. I am not too happy."
5,one of U2's best,"This is the first U2 album I have bought, and it was well worth it. Live versions of familiar tracks (i.e. Pride (In the Name of Love) and Bullet the Blue Sky got better, and studio tracks (i.e. Hawkmoon 269 and All I Want is You) really kick a**. This album, The Joshua Tree, and War comprise the three core albums for U2."
3,Inconsistantly good,"Rattle and Hum, as much as any other U2 album, can hold its head proudly in the band's awesome catalogue. It was certainly their most experimental (at the time) but, with a few exceptions, its good music again from the world's best band.The live version of Bullet the Blue Sky is stunning - the Joshua Tree version sounds half-hearted in comparison. Pride (In The Name Of Love) is also improved. The version of I Still Haven't Found, featuring black American gospel singers, is terrible.....but hey, you win some, you lose some!All I Want Is You is obviously the best of the new stuff, but God Part 2 and Heartland are also favourites of mine.There is an album's worth of great, U2 music on this CD.....it's just a matter of uncovering it from the junk."
4,"let's get real, here...","Hey, so this isn't U2's best album. Alright, so there are a few clunkers. Use the skip track button on your CD player, but you'll still need this album for some of the essentials.First, there's ANGEL OF HARLEM, one of their best songs (you won't find it elsewhere). It has a great horn section and evokes the spirit of NYC in wintertime. You also get some good covers, like the Beatles' HELTER SKELTER and the traditional VAN DIEMAN'S LAND (beautiful song sung by Edge).The other reason you should get this album is for the great live cuts. Highlights include STILL HAVEN'T FOUND..., which uses a black choir for backing vocals, and a blistering version of BULLET THE BLUE SKY, complete with some added stirring lyrics. ""The God I believe in isn't short of cash, mister."""
5,One of the Best,"This was the second U2 album I ever bought... Achtung Baby was the first. I was about 13 at the time...am 19 now, so it was a while ago. I didn't know until years after I fell in love with Rattle and Hum that it wasn't well received by fans or critics when it was released, which I thought--and still do think--was an abomination. Nothing could be a more perfect link between The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby than this CD. These songs have a passion that I rarely find in music, even U2 music recently. I can't listen to Rattle and Hum without getting a warm feeling in my chest.... Along with Achtung Baby and The Joshua Tree, I personally think this is one of the best U2 albums ever."
4,Inspiring,I am really getting into the spirited tones of U2. Bono sings with so much passion and the band really alters their style throughout the record.My two favorites on here are God Part II and Love Rescue Me. The vocals vary nicely between soft and loud on both tracks as you really can feel Bono's emotion as he sings the wrods. Van Diemans Land is another noteworthy tune that features The Edge on lead vocals. The cover tunes Helter Skelter and All Along The Watchtower sound fine as does Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For with the gospel arrangement.Truthfully this recording was the turning point for me with U2. Afterwards the band would record the highly acclaimed Achtung Baby and put some nice experiemntal pieces out on Zooropa and Pop before contributing The stunning recording All That You Can Leave Behind. Two thumbs up here.
2,disapointing!!!,"Only two songs are great Desire, All I want is you!!!There are some good live performaces, but Helter Skelter, and All along the watch tower covers were very bad moves!!!If you're a die hard fan, buy this for the two songs I mentioned because they're classics, but otherwise this is hardly essential!!!"
3,"Not quite as good as their regular albums, but its still U2","One thing about U2 is that their albums, particularly the Joshua tree, which Rattle and Hum followed, are best if listened to as a whole rather than just the best singles. Since Rattle is taken off of so many albums, it doesn't have that feel, so its not quite as good as their earlier stuff. It doesn't help that it came out after The Joshua Tree, which was a masterpeice. However, any collection of U2's best hits is going to be good and the version of Pride is fabulous, even better than the studio version."
2,I am rating this as a U2 album,"Because it's U2, you can't really compare it to the rest of popular music which is mostly bland by comparison. Any hard core U2 fan should buy all of their albums as they all have something unique to offer. This album, however, is one of the weaker works. It is worth it mostly for the live versions of previous U2 songs. The album is compleatly disjointed and contains some songs that I just cant help but skip. If you are new to U2 go buy Auchtung Baby, War, The Joshua Tree and the rest of their albums first."
1,Trash,"It would have been better to release an EP with the B-sides, and then release a live album. But no...they had to combine the two. Not that the selections are bad, it is just that this whole album is like a bad bootleg. Perhaps this was the intent, but who gives a flying f@#k? I sure don't...this album is a very poor collection."
1,Rattle And Yawn,Just because this may be the ultimate 80's album does not necessarily mean it is quality music.
4,This in an underrated album which rewards listeners.,"Heavily criticsied by the media as the manifestation of Bono et al`s bloated egos, U2`s Rattle and Hum is credited as being, essentially, an expensive flop. Coupled with the documentary of their `discovery` of America, this is a long underrated album which warrants a few plays before the full effect can be appreciated. Incorporating a myriad of styles, from the passion of #1 single `Desire` to the sometime melancholy of `Van Diemen`s Land`, through to the power of `Pride (In The Name Of Love), Rattle and Hum constitutes a showcase for the band`s flexibility and range. Not so much a coherent whole, as The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby represent; more a pick and mix of American music styles, as always impeccably interpreted by U2, who have since proven themselves (with the celebrated Popmart tour) to be one of the most versatile and exciting acts of contemporary music."
3,"Watch the movie, skip the CD","I'm a huge U2 fan and I consider it a big deal for me to tell people NOT to buy a U2 CD. It's just that this album really didn't have many good points to it. The live performances are infinitely more memorable in the movie (get the DVD) and the Sun Studio recorded stuff is middling at best. This whole record felt too self-indulgent and arrogant to me. People seem to latch onto ""All I Want Is You"", but frankly they bested that song with ""One"" and ""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"" three years later. The DVD is so much better."
3,mediocre,"I found the practice questions at the end of each chapter to be disappointing. Some were irrelevant to the test, many were confusingly or ambiguously worded and some of the answers given were flat-out wrong.If you only want to use one book I recomment SCWCD Exam Study Kit: Java Web Component Developer Certification by Hanumant Deshmukh, Jignesh Malavia."
2,Don't Use This Book As The Only Study Source For SCWCD,"If you use this book as the only study source, you will be in trouble. The book omits topic Section 7 - Designing and Developing Thread-Safe Servlets. Rely on other certification books - like SCWCD Exam Study Kit or Professional SCWCD Certification. Use this book as a supplement"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap! The drawers were cracked and coming apart when it came. Don't waste your time or money on this piece of junk!"
2,awful tassel,"The tassel came off in my hand as soon as I took it out of the plastic bag. Instead of going through the hassel of sending it back and waiting for another bag, I glued it back on.My friends call it the ""mango tango Diva"" bag because it looks good but you can't touch it or it'll break into pieces.Definitely, not worth the price."
1,I agree with Daniel J Brunkow ...,"... and many functions are obsolete. If you want to learn about PFC, read the Online Books."
1,Hard copy of online help,"The ""PFC Programmer's Reference Manual"" is basically a hard copy of the online help that comes with PFC. If that's what you're looking for this book is good, otherwise, you can get the same information from online help.This book also has some publishing errors - on page 83 it references Appendix M - the book has no appendix M!"
2,Not useful for PFC 6+,"This reference book restates most of the reference material available in the PFC online books. The reason for this (as stated in the book) is that back in PB 5 days, the online books were only available if the CD was in your drive. As of PB 6, the books can be installed on a hard drive. The PFC 6 features are only glanced at. The focus is on PFC 5 features. So if you're using PB 5/PFC 5, this book is great. Otherwise, it's not useful at all. I returned this book."
1,Doesn't add anything to the online help.,Mr. Brooks' book simply doesn't add anything substantial to the online help included with PowerBuilder. The book mainly consists of each user object's events and functions and their arguments--exactly what the online help does.There is a clear need in the PowerBuilder PFC programming community for a good full-featured manual.
1,Hard to read.,This is the worst book I have ever read. I put my nose through the thick book and learn nothing. Later I read a thin book from Powersoft PFC training. I learn a lot from each page of it.The author of this book does not know how to write book.
5,Just what I needed,"This book is exactly what I wanted it to be. It is a reference manual. I don't need a how to book and the title of this book led me to believe that it is exactly what it says that it is, a reference. Already I have put the 'How To' book in the bookshelf and relegted the CD to a rack in my closet but this book seems to have found a permanent spot on my desk within arm's reach."
4,easy to use,The product was ready to use right out of the box. No extra things to fumble around with. Small size not to take up any extra room. Great product.
1,Stern warning,No surprises...Stern's game plan for communist world domination and a new world order. Workers of the world united and all that nonsense. Another union organizer with pink soft hands and a pocket full of cash. Can't believe it took all those trips to the White House to shred the Constitution. Guys like this make me ashamed to be a union man. Destroying America bit by bit.
2,It's The Obvious,"This book states the obvious, then fits particular statistics to build an argument for Stern's point-of-view. He doesn't actually villify the other point-of-view, he just dismisses it as not worthy of the progressive mind discussing. The most frightening part is his lack of disclosure about similarly built systems of government that have failed miserably in the past. That's right, Stern's ideas are a prespcription for building socialist -- some may even say communist -- regimes. Trade unions at the forefront of progressive social and economic change? Hey, Eastern Europeans, how'd that work out for you? Should we give it a try here? Or maybe we should just let this book fall to its real market, commodity value, which unfortunately is very likely much less than I had to pay to read it on my Kindle."
4,Valerie,"Great music, great rhythm, excellent music. A must have for real listeners. Not to hard and not to soft."
2,Disappointing,"This Steve Winwood compilation is quite disappointing, to say the least. When I say a compilation is disappointing, that means it's pretty bad, because I'm quite lenient and always try to find the good in compilations, but there is very little good to say about this one. SO many key songs are missing and it just seems inexcusable. There are too many songs missing to even list. Sure, there are a few of his good songs here, but many are second-rate, filler songs. The best song on here is ""Higher Love"", a few others aren't bad, but not that great and then some are just not his best at all. I really wish they would come up with a MUCH better single-disc Steve Winwood compilation and show the true talent of this man."
3,mixed bag from 1977-1986,I have to say from the start I wouldn't class myself as a Steve Winwood fan - I liked his work with Spencer Davis Group and Traffic but solo he's been a bit hit and miss.The collection proves that point - the recently sampled 'Valerie' is here; alongside his 1980s hit 'Higher Love' (which sounds dated and a bit naff now). There's an awful lot of rubbish on here which shows a remarkable lack of imagination from Winwood and his usual collaborator Jennings.I welcome a CD which brings together the three (excellent) tracks which were collaborations between Winwood and Viv Stanshall though - 'Vacant Chair' from 1977; 'Arc of a Diver' from 1980; and 'My Love's Leavin'' from 1986. These tracks are terrific and - for me - worth the price of the album alone. I'll pass on the rest.
3,Could have been better.,"""Chronicles"" isn't really a ""Best Of"", or a ""Greatest Hits"", but more of a sampling of his best songs. It does include ""While You See A Chance"", ""Valerie"", and ""Higher Love"", but at just 10 tracks, it's missing way too much, and should have another 6-8 hits. Even from just his late 80's albums, where's ""Finer Things"", ""Freedom Overspill"", ""Back In The High Life Again"", ""Holding On"", ""Roll With It"", and the excellent ""Don't You Know What The Night Can Do?"". Still, this is pretty good, and will have to do until we get an ""Essential Winwood"" collection."
3,Not a bad collection...,"Lots of familiar stuff here and overall not too bad a transfer of previously recorded material. Joan Baez singing Diamonds and Rust is especially good, but on close listening I never realized just how atrocious the lyrics are to what is an exquisite melody. Same for the Poetry Man by Phoebe Snow; a lovely melody with rather unimaginative words. The Buffy Sainte Marie is simple, sweet and intimate, as is Janis Ian's At Seventeen. Wuthering Heights by Kate Bush sounds bright and thin, but wait, that's how her voice sounds anyway. Melanie, Bonnie Rait, Carly Simon and the McGarrigle sisters are nicely represented too. Nothing for the audiophile here but worth a listen if only for the nostalgia."
5,brilliance,"yeah well, i wanted to watch it because of the genre and boy was I pleased!yeah it was good, didn't really get much of the plot, or anything else for that matter, kept my eye out for a bit of the..you know...action"
3,Probably For EuroHorror Fans Only,"This is a subtle and atmospheric version of Sheridan LeFanu's Carmilla, in which the director is far more interested in detailing the failing marriage of his two principles than in using it as an excuse to string together the usual exploitation elements so beloved of EuroHorror fans. Director Aranda takes his time over telling the story of a marriage beginning to crumble almost before it has begun. Appearing almost in the first scene, Alexandra Bastedo's seductress is always in the background, orchestrating the transformation of love and affection into alienation and hatred. Far more profound than the film of Jean Rollin, this nevertheless delivers the requisite gory murders and naked ladies lying in coffins that fans of that director will probably enjoy.An amusing 'Combo' trailer included on this disc pairs the above with the somewhat less than subtle 'I Dismember Mama' - and its worth two minutes of anyone's time."
4,an excellent Euro horror,"I'll keep this quick and simple. If you like Euro Horror stuff from the late 60's and 70's than you can't go wrong this film. Although the title is much, much cooler than the film itself, it is still a good representation of Euro horror. Reminds me of Torso and Tourist Trap a little, just a little. Nonetheless, it's a great buy for your collection and the print rendered on this DVD is excellent!"
4,Spanish Gothic,"""The Blood Spattered Bride"" is a pretty decent specimen of the European Gothic cinema. The story develops a bit slowly, but is handsomely mounted and photographed. The ""female rage"" theme is explicit and disturbing. The actresses playing Carmilla and Susan are quite attractive. The film handles their lesbian relationship with a restraint that is rare in Euro-horror items."
5,great wrench for easy bike repairs,Although i have used this only once to install some pedals i think this is a great wrench for easy jobs.
3,Missing the story,"I really liked the first installment of this series, both for being over-the-top and having an interesting story.The second season, I had a hard time keeping track of what was going on. I even rewatched a few episodes because I felt like I had missed something in a previous episode. If you watched s1 for the fights, you will not be disappointed."
4,Honolulu Play-Off..A Fun Read,"Alan Saxon flies to Honolulu to act as best man at the wedding of a close friend. Trouble starts when Saxon plays a round on the Ko Olina course and things get rapidly worse that evening during a night out on the town ending in murder.Just as in the last Alan Saxon mystery you will find lots of excitement, lovely women, a round or two of golf, a bit of derring do and an involved mystery with a nasty villain. Well written characters ( just can't help but like Alan Saxon) although I did find that there seemed to be too many disagreeable characters (you just wanted to smack them upside the head..they were really that disagreeable). And a mystery that will leave you guessing until the end."
4,Great commentary for teachers,"Kent Hughes has a wonderful ability to distill the thoughts of each passage. He is neither too simple or too technical. He gets right to the main point of the passage, offers meat to chew on, and keeps moving on. Very nice balance between the technical commentaries (which I also use) one can get lost in, and the useless light weight works. All his commentaries are a pleasure to read. Very edifying!Important note! Most of the other reviews listed for this commentary are actually reviewing another commentary by Charles Hodge. Not sure how this confusion happened, but be aware they are reviewing an entirely different work. Both are good, but very different!"
5,Best commentary on Romans you can find!,"I had previously read R. Kent Hughes commentary on Hebrews and loved it so I thought I would give his commentary on Romans a try. I was not disappointed. Anyone wanting to go deeper into the book of Romans should buy this book! Hughes gives an easy to understand, down to earth application of each passage. I recommended this to anyone wanting to breakdown the most Theologically heavy book in the Bible!"
3,"Cute, but could have been better","As a clergywoman myself, I enjoyed Betsy's story. Patillo does a good job of illuminating the joys and complications of being a woman pastor - especially when it comes to romance. But my expectations were either too high or Patillo's sights were too low; the writing was 'okay' at best, and the frothy story could have had quite a bit more weight and still have been enjoyable. Fun to read, but a slight disappointment."
3,"Cute, a little frothy, but with plenty of realism.","I'm not a romantic comedy kind of gal, but as a single clergywoman, I was intrigued by the topic of this book. I found the church aspects of it to be spot-on accurate, the characters likeable, and the prose lively."
3,Okay but not great,"I love light romantic comedies and the synopsis on the back of the book jacket promised just that. However, while the book was an okay read, I didn't find a single laugh out loud moment in it. The author's premise was good, but the writing was a little flat and the characters just weren't all that interesting. All in all, it felt pretty bland."
2,Seems to need another to be able to enjoy fully.,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew. Upon unpackaging, he and his mom found that there were pieces missing. They called the company (I told them later, I could have sent it back to Amazon for an easy replacement). It took over a week to get the part. Once put together, it ran, but seems to need another of the same toy to make it more fun to play with."
1,Muted colors make it hard to tell the different numbers apart.,"I bought this set to replace a ""Pavilion"" brand dominoes set I had that was missing a domino. The old set had very bright, easily distinguishable colors. The colors on these dominoes are very muted and it's VERY hard to tell the different numbers apart...plus the dots are smaller than the old set. I sent them back and just ordered a set of ""Cardinal"" brand dominoes. Hopefully they'll work better than these."
5,Fun and Educational,My son wanted these for Christmas after using them at school for Math work. He has had a lot of fun playing with them and using them for Math games.
4,Great Mic for the Money,"I use a Sennhieser MK-416 as sound man for a video production company, so obviously I've been spoiled with the superb sound of this excellent mic. I didn't expect much from the ME66, but was pleasantly surprised--great construction, really nice angle of coverage, and a very pleasant, full sound. Had a slight peaking problem a first, but learned to work with it. The sound is not as full as the MK-416, but it's half the price--! Highly recommended--even if you upgrade at a future date I doubt you'll want to sell this mic--it's easy to get attached to. Be sure to buy the K6 module---"
2,"Great song selection, mostly disappointing audio","In my opinion, this CD has the best song selection available on this great band. But just like the Sony/Columbia CD, they did not bother to properly restore this material. There is a lot of echo in many of the tracks, interestingly enough though, ""Scub Me Mama"" is the alternate take. Untill someone properly issues this material, I'll keep playing my 78's."
1,"STOP << SPIT, BREATHING, AND SWALLOWING","IN THIS AUDIO, YOU CAN HEAR THE LADY SWALLOWING, BREATHING AND YOU CAN EVEN HEAR THE SPIT IN HER MOUTH. IT IS DISGUSTING ON ALL LEVELS. IM SURPRISED THEY DID NOT DELETE THESE SOUNDS WHEN DOING THE FINAL EDITITING. ALL I CAN HEAR IS HER TAKING DEEP BREATHS AND SWALLOWING VERY THICK SPIT. EITHER THE LADY IS DEHYDRATED OR IS DIABETIC! EW..."
2,Terribly uncomfortable,"I purchased this item for two reasons: it had the dumbbell handles, and it was cheaper than almost all of the other similar sets. While I've used the dumbbell handles numerous times and like them, I've only used the curl bar once.The principle behind the ""ez-curl"" bars is that they're more ergonomic and supposed to allow you to do a more natural grip on the bar. Of all of the curl bars I've used in the last 17 years, this is the only one that hurt just like I was using a regular straight bar. In fact, I'm contemplating cutting the ends off this thing and welding them onto my Harbinger ""threaded super curl bar"" which I love the feel of but unfortunately can't handle olympic plates.I do not recommend this product to others."
4,"Low price, low quality","Well, heres the thing. When you think you're getting a steal because of such a low price, remember...You get what you pay for. That being said, the bar is not horrible, but it lacks quality. One end of the bar was actually pouring out some sort of dark colored dust that i can only assume is iron oxidation. The rest of the bar is chromed, however, when i turned the bar vertical you could clearly see the dust fall out and dissipate into the air. Anyway, the dumbell handles are alright. no complaints. However, if you're used to regular weights, these olympic dumbells will take some getting use to (particularly the length of them) All in all, you really cant beat the price for the 3 pieces. Trust me, i checked and looked. So, may not be the highest quality but it will certainly get the job done."
5,Fantastic,Great product...delivered quickly...has made lifting weights a breeze with easy to change clips for each bar...good quality with easy to grip handles...
3,Bellow Average Bars,"This set of bars are all hallow (of course, it says so in the title) but are cheaply made. The plastic end caps normally interfere with the attachments of the sleeves that would fit over them to hold weight plates from falling off. (Have fun taking them off as well) You don't want to remove those plastic end caps either or you will be presented with a sharp jagged edge that won't hesitate to rip into your flesh.Every bar is also covered in a oily mucus that stains anything it touches a dull gray, so make sure you have an old towel or wash cloth ready for these babies as they are removed from their respective packages.In closing, I would say these bars are sufficient for a child or amateur if you're on a tight budget, but would not recommend them for any adult or person serious about lifting. Just spend the additional $10-20 on a set of solid bars."
4,Hollow Bar,"Bar was received in plenty of time for Christmas. Just what my son expected, and he is very pleased with the quality. The box arrived partly smashed and open on one end, but there was no damage to the bar. A busy time for UPS, so sometimes things happen. I would Recommend to vendor that ends of boxes be reinforced with extra cardboard since it is such a long box."
3,OK But Not Great,The weights spin around on the bar when you do curls. Maybe it's just me but this is very annoying and makes lifting uncomfortable. I would recommend buying a bar that has the spin locks on it.
2,Don't bother,"Do not waste your time with these. They are too light, so don't stand up over time and the spring clasps couldn't hold a baby's diaper on let alone a 5 pound weight plate"
2,Its ok,"This set is hollow and feels low quality, the curl bar works ok but the dumbbells are just to light and hollow feeling. I would recommend getting a hight quality set."
2,Ok until it broke,"The bars worked ok for a few months, but then broke. One end of one of the small bars detached from the bar making it useless. Not happy."
3,not great sound but durable,I was looking for an inexpensive djembe for my kids that would produce a good sound. This is durable but the sound is not very full. I should have gotten a wooden one.
4,An interesting take on how astrology works,"The author reviews the type of knowledge that constitutes astrology. He makes some useful points about what astrology is and what it is not. His analysis of Koestler's chart is well worth reading. This is a somewhat dated book but many useful insights. It does not teach astrology, but presents the author's views about astrology based on his many years of experience with the discipline. This is probably not the kind of book one would return to as a reference. It is better suited to a one-time reading and can probably be found at any library."
2,to read or not to read...,"Very hard to read as the plot plods along with excrutiating detail and little left to the imagination. I imagine this would make a better screenplay than it does a book.Interesting subject matter, though. Not often covered in modern literature, journalistic or otherwise."
5,She who Changes,I think the author does an excellent job of helping the reader understand a new vision of God. It is obvious from the book that our current vision of God is warped and outdated.
1,karaoke has been better,if you can't hit the notes don't sing the songs. nothing more disappointing then a singer who sings the songs of another great artist and changes the key and melody of a song just so that they tehmselves can pull it off. bad choice for don to do an album of remakes where his vocal abilty is far inferior to that of the artist. if he sang these songs on american idol he would have been booted off in the 1st round. just proves what an amazing vocalist robbins really was..and how underrated.
3,Mostly aimless and depressing.,"I'm not very enthusiastic about this book although I finished it. The story had some strange and disturbing twists, but never really gripped this reader. It reminded me in some ways of Bonfire of the Vanities--big shot gets in lots of trouble with the law--but with a very different kind of ending. Basically though the characters seemed humorless and drab. They didn't seem to be drawn from life (unless perhaps your life is Princeton where I believe Oates is a faculty member). In the dialogue the characters kept saying things like ""Why on earth did you...?"" and ""What earthly reason was there for...?"" The earth was invoked in this way at least forty times. I guess I never figured out what on earth the author was trying to get across except that even apparently happy and successful lives can be pretty aimless and depressing--like this book. If that turns you on, by all means read it."
3,spot on,"""interstices"" is another oft-repeated word. I found this book's main characters so annoying about midway through the book; people do things that make no sense, or an aspect of their chacter that would cause them to behave this way is missing. The ending is weird both in its brevity and occurance, and the book also feel dated, from the 1980's - who wants to relive the 80's in upper-class suburbia?"
4,Halston Cologne,"Wife loved it. Great b-day gift. She ia a complete Halston fan. When it finally came, she had already bought some elsewhere. Now she has extra."
1,Love this Marpac,We bought our 1st Marpac back in the early 90's and loved it and still use it. I have bought some other lesser priced ones for traveling and none of them were nearly as good at the Marpac. Somehow I stumbled on this and realized it was just like our old one that has been used thousands of times and decided that cheaper is not always better. Thank you for such a great product!!!
2,Great but broke within a year,Absolutely loved this travel sound conditioner. Unfortunately it broke in less than a year so we have to order a new one. Maybe they make it that way?1
4,great a must have for travel,Great this is a must have for travel. Cancels out all the noise and unfamiliar sounds so you get a good nights sleep.
4,Pleased thus far,"We've had this for about two months and use it in our baby's nursery. I like it so far. The sound fills the room well. There aren't a bunch of options in sound, but that doesn't matter at all to me. The unit is small and does the job well. I'd recommend it."
4,Buy this if you must have white noise to sleep,"I had to buy this because my sound machine died, and I was totally dependent on it to sleep. I only used it for the white noise option among the six options it had, and the newer models did not have a white noise option. It seems like they got rid of that on every sound machine out there! The Marsona was just what I needed and the noise level is fine. Also, since it isn't a sound clip, you don't start to hear a repetitive noise (which can drive you crazy if you are trying to sleep!). My only complaints are that I think it costs way too much, especially since it looks like an old alarm clock from the 80s, and the battery option was separate and also expensive. I didn't think it would matter since I always travel with the plug, but then my power went out and I was wishing it had a battery!"
4,"Best sound machine made, except for the cord","This is the best sound machine- white noise sleep sound- ever. I have tried them all! But they have a [problem with the cords- I have used the same white noise generators from Marsona and replaced the cord 3 times. There is nothing worse than arriving at a noisy hotel to have the sound machine fail because of a cord that seems to break internally at the plug end of the thing. Other than that- the noise is not tinny, does not have radio sounds to it and is nice and even. Don't bother with those with bells and whistles, get the basic and use the waterfall! It's a winner- but buy and extra plug..."
2,Didn't work for me,There was nothing wrong with the product itself but I am a very light sleeper and this sound machine still made too much noise for me to sleep. If I did fall asleep I woke up often and couldn't get back to sleep easily. I did better with ear plugs so I returned this product.
2,Worked until it shorted out,This machine is small enough to travel well. It only makes one type of sound (kind of like rain) so all you can adjust is the intensity and volume. It shorted out and would stop and start which wakes you up defeating the purpose. It is too expensive for having no sound selections and being cheaply made.
2,disappointing,"I was led to believe that this was a powerful machine. Yeah right! I even called every company selling this product and they all told me how great it was and how powerful it was. I need something strong because of the noise in my apartment building. The reviews on here were also great, so I took my chances. When I received it, I was terribly disappointed. It was no more powerful that the Marpac 980, which I also think is not nearly powerful enough for my situation. I hear people say that these machines are too loud. I can't understand how they come up with that. I returned the Marsona 330, and then I tried the Ecotones Duet---I am finally happy."
4,Buying another one!,"I have used the Marsona 330 sound machine for almost a year now and it is perfect for the frequent traveler. However, I tried using it with a universal converter while in Barcelona and it blew the power supply. So if doing international travel, purchase the 330i."
2,Not what I had hoped for.,If all you are looking for is a machine to make white noise then you will like this one. The sound therapy machine I have at home actually makes different sounds including white noise. I bought this to travel with and all it does is change the pitch of the white noise to make different sounds. For the price I expected better.
3,Not sure,"Used it for a couple of weeks. It kind of grows on you. I don't know if it helps me sleep or not, but I don'g mind it."
4,"Good machine, one important flaw","My wife and I have used a sound machine for years. We have several and generally travel with one. Based on the reviews here, I decided to buy a Marpac for our travel noise machine. I like the white noise part - simple and effective. What I don't like is the fact that the transformer is 120v only. That is both unexpected and annoying in this day and age. Nor does the Amazon web page provide this information. Either I have to buy the Marpac battery pack or another transformer that takes 220v or I can't use it in many of the countries I visit."
3,How it really works,"If you're interested, it's got a few settings labeled for consumers that are dumbed down to the point where it doesn't tell you what it does.It's got a slider ""Rain to Waterfall"" which really means high pitched to low-pitched (continuously variable) and a selection switch for ""rain/waterfall or surf"". ""Surf"" just means the volume pans up and down, ""while rain/waterfall"" means it's held constant.Other than that, it's pretty much a straight up white noise generator with a mediocre speaker. The sound is pure white noise and not any kind of recording.It's not bad, and it gets the job done, but it's nothing to write home about."
5,Environmental Sounds white noise machine,"Marsona TSC-330i White Noise Travel Sound Conditioner (International Model)Outstanding item, it has made a significant in our sleep patterns. Soothing, several different volumes, and small enough to easily pack with us. Has 2 sounds - waterfall and rain. It would be great if it could have a little more variety, but we are still very satisfied with this product. Definitely worth it."
5,Very compact and excellent noise maker,"There are only a few settings. Volume. A slider that changes the sound from rain to ocean. And a selector to make something like ""wave"" variations. It is not a recording so there is not pattern to notice and lie awake anticipating :)"
1,Lasted less than 5 months,"We ordered this in January 2012 and by the end of May 2012, it was making an intermitent loud static sound, which would wake you up. Won't buy this brand again."
1,Not adequate for me!,We've used Marpac machines before and they were excellent; but this Travel machine didn't make the grade. Sound not loud enough for us and the construction didn't seem any better than the $20 ones we've used. This was $50+. We returned it to Amazon.
5,What a difference!,"I don't know how I ever survived without this machine. Yes, it's PERFECT for travel, (granted I don't use the battery pack as it's super easy to plug in just about anywhere I travel), but it's great for every day use as well. I originally purchased this for me, but have since begun using it in my daughter's room during nap time. Having 2 other kids, it's impossible to keep the house quiet during her nap and this has been the perfect solution.It was the other reviewers that convinced me to spend the $70.00 on this and I have to say I agree with them... It was money well spent. There's such a difference in quality over similar products that there's really no comparison. I highly recommend this travel unit to anyone!"
1,"The emphasis should be on ""white noise""","Although this product claims to have rain and wave sounds, the only sound it makes (in different volumes and pitches) is static. It's about as pleasant as falling asleep with the tv untuned, which used to be possible back in the days before cable. That's not to say that this is a bad product, and certainly it's possible people enjoy listening to static before they fall asleep, but I do not."
4,So far everything I expected,"Got it because my 5mth yr old cats won't let me sleep through the night by crying at my door to let them in (and then never sleeping if I ever do). So far, this has done the trick. I use the (rain/waterfall) setting, which while being white noise I think does a good simulation, to sleep since I need the constant noise.However, for just relaxing I have put on the shore mode (which just lowers and raises the volume) and it really does remind me of being on a beach. It's small, compact and I really like it.Note: this is my first purchase of a noise machine like this."
3,Power Supply 120V Only,I wish I had known the power supply wasn't dual voltage as I bought if specifically for a vacation in Europe.
4,excellent travel companion,"I take my travel white noise machine everywhere, including visits to grandchildren. However, I am currently in Rome living on a busy street and it suddenly quit in the middle of the night. I do not know why it burned out. I do plan to buy another one but feel it should not have suddenly stopped working. I would have given it a 5 star rating if it had not quit working. I agree with other reviewers that it provides a constant white noise and does not have irritating repeat patterns that some machines have."
4,sound machine,The machine works. It makes a masking sound that shuts out ambient noise. There is a two day period to get used to the sound and then you will not wish to be without it.
5,Awesome noise for such a little machine!,"I thought this unit might help a little when we go to Las Vegas withthe hallway noise. We are used to running a huge Honeywell air cleaner next to the bedfor white noise. This little unit makes some big white noise!! I was really surprised.It also has a volume control for those who don't like ""rainstorms""!We are very pleased. Vegas doesn't seem so noisy anymore!"
1,AWFUL!,"Please cancel this order! We requested expedited shipping, which was supposed to arrive December 15 to 22. On January 5, we e-mailed the seller asking when we could expect delivery. We got an e-mail saying they'd ship ""today."" It's January 13 and we haven't received the merchandise (from Indiana to Wisconsin...please!). DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS VENDOR! We're canceling this order and contacting the credit card company to seek a refund. Amazon...stop doing business with this vendor!"
4,Gossame Wings Fleece Blanket,This beautiful blanket completes our Gossamer Wings collection. You'll be very satisfied with this purchase.
1,Buy the Gamelink 400 instead.,"By purchasing this cable set, you are limiting your options. You now must use your A/V receiver for sound whenever you play a game because you loose the analog sound connection you have with the 400 (the analog sound comes out of the same port as the video). Spend the 10 dollars you save on an inexpensive optical cable and you now have the best of both worlds, you have the option of using the tv for sound OR the A/V receiver with the same quality video. I will say that the video quality on my 62"" HDTV improved dramatically with the addition of the component (red, green, blue) video Gamelink 400 over the composite (one video cable) connection that comes with the PS2. However if you're the kind of person who thinks the 450 MUST be better because it's a bigger number than the 400, it probably won't matter to you anyway..."
1,Are you a sucker with too much money?,"Then this product is for you! Otherwise, there is NO justifiable reason to pay even Amazon.com's marked-down price for this product. There is NO appreciable difference in video quality when using Monster component video cables; in fact, I've experienced the opposite. I've been through two sets of these cables, and each time, I've had to futz with the connection at the back of the PS2 in order to get video of ANY kind. Save your money; buy a cheaper cable that will actually WORK."
1,what is this cable?,"whatever it is, it isn't hdmi to component video that I needed and searched for in Amazaon. A waste of $20"
1,THIS IS NOT FOR A Wii!!!,"I did a search for ""Wii Component cable"" and this product showed up. It was OBVIOUSLY done on purpose to show up as a Wii product when it's really for a PS2."
1,Monster doesn't equal quality,bought to improve picture on ps2. Cable died after a month and produced a black and white picture. Lame. It was cheap thanks to amazon so not a big loss.
1,"Quite frankly, they don't even work","What some other reviewers said is partially true, the cables dont fit well at all into my component video slots. They have no mechanism for them to hold onto and the slightest nudge pushes them out of place.Possibly because of that, they don't even transmit a signal. No video, no audio. This is inexcusable especially after you drop 50 bones on a pair of cables that don't even fit securely. My PS2 is rather old, considering I've had it since launch, although this should be no reason for cables not to work. Either I have a bum copy, or Monster cable needs to make sure their cables fit properly. One other problem, the cables make almost no sense in their color coding, it took me the better part of an hour to figure out which goes into which. Is it not possible to just have the cables a different color band, such as the Xbox 360 standard cables?These minor things and the fact that I get no signal make me furious for even wasting my time with this."
4,PS2 can look great on HDTV with these,"I have a PS3 and a HDTV, but I keep my PS2 active and included in my AV setup. I was using the stock PS2 cable, but could not use the progressive scan feature available in many PS2 games. Seems the composite connections won't support prog. scan (at least on my set), and the difference is big on a HDTV. These cables did the trick! Very high quality, and very long as well. Running your PS3 in component cleans up the picture, and being able to use the progressive scan makes it look even better. If you use your PS2, get these before they disappear forever."
5,Gird Yourself,"It is amazing to me how Chip Ingram can take one verse and write a book on it. His description of the armor of a Roman soldier is both unique (in my experience, at least) and succinct.Ingram states something in this volume that many modern Christians don't want to face; there is evil, it is personal, it is involved in a battle that is beyond our vision, it has an invisible face, it is very attractive, and if you don't believe it then you cannot believe in the Christian God.It is that simple.His Biblical description of Satan, Devil, Lucifer, Beelzebub, Belial, The Evil One, The Tempter, The Prince of This World, and the Accuser of the Bretheren is informative. His application of these names to the sufferings of many Christian minds and families is appropriate. There are many who need to realize why they feel as they do about their faith, strong or weak.The solutions offered are doable and in accordance with Biblical principles.Larry FischerTopeka, Kansas"
4,Balanced and Biblical,"I found this book to be a helpful addition to the subject of spiritual warfare. Illustrative stories helped to explain the principles explained, and the ongoing conflict of the Kingdom of Light with the kingdom of darkness and our role in it is clearly explained. For more advanced study, I would recommend Ed Murphy's Handbook of Spiritual Warfare."
1,not what i expected,I heard about this book on the radio and was so excited to read it but was disappointed when it came and I discovered that it is like one of three books and the one I probably need is the third one.... very disappointed.
4,Expected more,"The author's encounters were helpful, however I was expecting a little more based on the title. I know persons have had some very serious encounters, and have much to say on the subject. Helpful never the less."
3,AN OK Book,This book was not quite what I expected. It is good and theologically sound but I was hoping for a little more clear instruction in how to deal with how absolutely raw and evil our society is.
1,Beware Buyer,"X-Plane customer service is horrible. Contrary to their web site, the free lifetime customer support is support with an attitude. No one there wants to talk to you, no one wants to believe that their product might have problems, basically, they don't care about the customers. Beware customer - Beware!"
4,Buen equipo para principiantes,Si buscas un equipo con opciones básicas y no dispones de mucho dinero esta es una buena opción.
3,Got expired crackers.,"Previously, I ordered these crackers from the original Dr. Kracker company. I was completely satisfied until Amazon took over. After that, Amazon changed the bundle so that one must buy 6 boxes at a time, which is way too much. Also, the last shipment of crackers I received were expired. I only noticed that after I had gone through half of them wondering why they were stale. Make sure yours are not expired before you eat them. The crackers are tasty. I prefer the pumpkin cheese, but the overall experience has been meteocre."
2,Broken Crackers,Very disappointed with the product. Most of the crackers were broken when they arrived. They were nothing like the ones I had received at a conference in individual wrapped packages of 4 cracker. Not happy with the product as received.
2,Amazon keeps on sending me the wrong item,"Be cautioned when ordering this product.What happened was I ordered this product a month ago, and was sent the flatbread version instead of the clear tub of bite-size version. I called Amazon, explained my problem, they promised to fix it by sending me a replacement.Well, the replacement came last week, and it was still the flatbread. I'm not going to bother to call Amazon again because I know it will just result in them sending me the flatbread once again.The flatbread itself was tasty and crunchy. I think the seeds really helped to put more complexity into the flavor. You can eat just the flatbread as snacks or maybe put a bit peanut butter or jam on top. It tastes very different than wheat, and I like the taste of spelt quite a bit.So please be prepared to receive the flatbread version when you order. You may as well just order the flatbread version to start with and save yourself couple of bucks as well as having to call Amazon to straighten things out."
3,Incomplete,"For a guy who died so young, Gram made a lot of music and was an incalculable influence on future musicians. He moved fast, and that makes it hard to put together a compilation. This one is a good effort, but like most comps it skips my favorite song (in this case, Big Mouth Blues).The great bulk of this 2-disc set is available on 4 discs: The 2fer edition of Gram Parsons Solo Records GP and Grievous Angel; Byrds' Sweetheart of the Rodeo, The International Submarine Band's album, and Flying Burrito Bros' Gilded Palace of Sin.I personally think it makes more sense to just go out and buy those discs than another (quite fine) comp. That way, you get (almost) everything, the way it meant to be heard."
5,"One Hot Burrito To Go, Please.","If you appreciate the talents of Gram Parsons and share an affinity for what is now ""old Style"" country that is fused with ""old style"" rock, then this compilation is for you. I was a big fan of the Burritos in the seventies and had a deep appreciation for the later solo work of Parsons, but I had never had the opportunity to experience his work with The International Submarine Band. Well, I was blown away! The songs hold up today as a kind of pure country music that tells stories of good old Christian men and women who commit sins every day, but we still love and forgive them. Even when the songs are sung from the lips of the condemned, waiting on death row for the ultimate fate to befall them. There is such depth and texture in these discs that any fan will be totally satisfied with this boxed set. Buy it now!"
4,Gram Never Claimed to be Country Rock,"The reviewer who wrote the piece, ""Gram no Pioneerof Country Rock"" is obviously brain dead! Gram neverliked the term ""Country Rock"" but rather calledhis music "" Cosmic American Music."" Yes ClarenceWhite was also a pioneer of what ever you want tocall this music. I highly recomend this CD!I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5 onlybecause I suggest buying all this stuff withmore on the original CD's. The previous reviewermakes no sense calling Sweetheart of the Rodeopure country and bashing Gram. So what if it ispure country! It's good. The previous reviewerseems confused and more concerned about who fitswhich or what label than how the music sounds!"
4,"Very comfortable, Way too small","Bought them for my husband for his birthday. Quality is outstanding and so comfortable, problem is, they fit me, not my husband. These run at least a whole size too small. The pilling inside is so good, it takes up most of the slipper. Order one size larger and you'll be very happy."
1,Gave me a rash,"This deodorant works pretty well in keeping odor down, but it made my underarms red. I stopped using it and immediately it cleared up. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke, I tried using it again, but I immediately had red underarms. I did some research and found out that talc (one of the ingredients) can cause irritation in a lot of people. I bought a 4-pack so now I'm stuck with 3 unopened containers I can't use! :("
2,Sorry I bought it,We bought it for our daughter as an inexpensive camera.(1) It takes 4 AAA batteries(2) It takes a LOT of batteries.(3) The Simple Tech CF memory card included is not compatible.(4) The darned thing creaks as you press buttons.(5) It is SLOW.(6) The most difficult digital camera to use so far.Buy something else.
1,"ARGUS, they might make good file cameras but not digital.","I purchased the ARGUS DC3500 after careful review and comparison. The Argus people need to go back to the drawing board on this camera. I had the following problems: Image Quality (color is very very bad); Battery life (I got 10 pictures max); The camera overheated; You could'nt tell if the camera was on or not and when it was it didn't work well at all. The argus is also very particular about what type of memory media you try to use with it. The argus has very poor firmware, even the words are not spelled correctly (what does out of momery mean exactly??). In a word, spend ... more and get something better ..."
3,So many battery's,"I agree that this is a very good camera, except for the battery drain. I have gone through so many battery's I had to invest in rechargables. They should really have an AC adapter come standard with the camera. I do like my camera, once you get the hang of the menu system and figure out if your camera is on or off it's easy to use. Does take very nice pictures. If you purcase this camera better get an AC adapter or rechargables as well."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"The sale data says it requires 2 - AA batteries - THIS IS WRONG - it takes 4-AAA batteries - have you ever tried to find rechargeable AAA batteries and the Recharger for AAA batteries - the drain on regular AAA is immense - cannot locate attachments for alternate power sources, i.e., car lighter, outlet at home. THESE ARE BIG PROBLEMS - Directions are complicated - Price is great, size is great - otherwise misleading"
4,"Good toy, okay design","This is a fun design but the arm/bucket controls can impede each other. If the arms are raised to the maximum position and the bucket pulled back to its limit, then the arms cannot be lowered to the ground. The Amazon price is usually a great value on this item."
2,Dumped it 1/4 of the way through,"I am sorry to those who love this book, but I would have to agree with the last review written. I got to page 110 and couldn't go any further. I know, I know that it gets better further on but it was so damn boring & it was such a tedious job getting to where I already was that I couldn't keep it up.Why? I really don't know. Pearson's dialogue between characters is really not that good at all & maybe his plots are better, but the story wasn't really going anywhere and it didn't get my attention right from the beginning, therefore it was doomed!The last reviewer said that after 200 pages the story gets better but nothing that hasn't been done before so I though, why bother? esp when I have a stack of Michael Connelly and Dennis Lehane to keep me going for the next few weeks.Maybe I should have stuck with the rest of the book, but the writing and character development is terrible. Crime fiction lovers, do yourself a major favour and read Michael Connolley instead."
5,undercurrents,I just recently started to read Ridley Pearson. The Lou Boldt series. I was very pleased. I think he will become one of my favorite authors.
5,Ridley Pearson at his best,"This was my first Ridley Pearson book. I had read an article in the Boston Globe regarding new mystery writers and decided to try them all. Pearson is the one that I have stuck with.When I first read Undercurrents, I literally could not put it down. In fact I missed an Eric Clapton concert because I lost track of the time.This is the first Lou and Daphne novel and, arguably, the best!"
4,Very intellectual,A complex plot blended with an intelligent whodunit. Detective Boldt with his remarks and questions forces the reader to participate and wonder all the time. Suitable for everyone who wish to think as part of the entertainment
5,Great Multi-Vitamin,An excellent broad based vitamin that works well because of the softgel feature. The price on Amazon is the best one can generally find.
1,Product ?????,Received product in the mail. Apon opening it. Found over 50 pervent of the soft gels broken. Not a good way to receive a first order. I returned it and request payment back. To bad.............
5,Thank You!,"I read this book years ago (my kids are adults now) and it saved my sanity! Like so many other mothers before me, I had been laboring under the notion that, since I was lucky enough to be a stay-home mom, I had to be perfect at everything. I can still remember when Mrs. Lewis described how she frequently wrote her book late at night while listening to the buckles on her kids' overalls clacking about inside the dryer...I had tried to write a book when my kids were little, but it was beyond me. (And I only had 2 kids. She had 5, as I recall!) Stumbling across this book on Amazon today brought back some great memories of my ""EUREKA!"" moment: the day I realized that our job was the most demanding (and draining) assigment in the world. It also helped me to see that being a mommy is the most rewarding job in the universe. Oh, and I gave copies of this remarkable book to all my 'new mother' friends. I can now say Thank You to this author! She has NO idea how she changed my life!"
5,Great looking watch for less than $100!,"This watch, made by Movado, is an excellent buy. The face is classic and stylish. I get compliments all the time on it. I was looking for a watch with a good stopwatch function for my job, and this one is perfect. It uses the second hand for the stopwatch (the seconds for the watch are on a small dial); it is able to measure to the tenths of a second on a sub dial as well. Between its stylish looks, its high end manufacturer, and its functional stopwatch, I couldn't be more pleased! Also, if you are near a Movado store or outlet, they will size this for you for free!"
4,very nice,"i like very much this item, just it does not have a battery that has to be replaced but still is very nice product."
2,Wish I liked it more...,"Melissa Etheridge is one of my favorite singers. Every other one of her CDs are ones I'd put on my ""Deserted Island List."" This one just doesn't do it for me. I love the singles ""Like The Way I Do"", ""Similar Features,"" and, of course, ""Bring Me Some Water."" The rest, however, is fair to middling. I found the ballads just didn't work for me, particularly compared to the ones on Brave and Crazy, which I love. The quality of singing is as good as any other, and the musicianship is fine, but the whole package just doesn't come together for me."
3,Worth a listen!,"I do not aggree with this singer's outlook on many issues, but her music is a different story."
4,Cherokee Warriors: The Captive,Ms. Dellin has created another strong female character in Raney Childress. She broke Creed Sixkiller's heart years earlier when she decline his proprosal. Her father would not allow her to marry an indian. I found Creed Sixkiller entertaining has he tried to keep his feeling surpressed during their adventure of trying to find her younger brother.
4,"Not at her best, but that's hard to beat.","Here is what one ignorant listener had to say about 1,000 Oceans: ""Is it just me or wasn't this like a really popular country song like 10 years ago? And, yes, I'm half serious. . .1000 oceans has been done about 1000 times..."" Where does this come from. Tori is a true artist, and she is to say the least original. I would say unique. Its a great song so give it a listen."
3,what is this?!?!?!?!?!?,"Look, I love Tori as much as the next addict, but what is this???? Silly. The live ""Baker Baker"" is 86 times better than ""1,000 Oceans"". I think that this new song is pretty darn cheesy compared to her other work. It's soooooo.......marketable."
4,"pretty song, but not her best","It's a nice song. It really is. Except, when I first heard it, I was sure it must be a cover. Her heart just doesn't seem in it the way it is for most of the songs she writes- or even for some of her covers, like ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and ""Famous Blue Raincoat."" The atmosphere of ""1000 Oceans"" reminded me a lot of her versions of ""Angie,"" ""Smells Like Teen Spirit,"" and ""Thank You,"" which may or may not be at least slightly tongue-in-cheek. To call ""1000 Oceans"" Tori's best song ever is ridiculous; it's not even the best song on To Venus and Back- ""Suede"" and ""Josephine"" are much better. Let's just say it's a nice song, but I hope it's not indicative of whatever new direction Tori's going in. The live version of ""Baker, Baker"" is nice."
4,Great,"This was simple to install, works like a charm. My wife loves it and we don't have to worry about the old tennis ball on the string any longer!!!!"
3,Not bad for price.,"I bought two for my garage, and received on that only one laser worked. That said they do serve there purpose. I use one for each car so I can set a max and min (one laser for each position) as to how far to pull in. Only had a few instances of the motion sensor not working, so I would say 97% of the time they work."
2,parking system,Dual garage laser parking system is not sensitive enough and does not remain on long enough. It will go off before your car is in position. Also after it goes off more movement with the car will not reactivate it.
3,its ok,It works good. I've had one similar to this before. My only complaint is that the laser should be a brighter more distinct when it spears. It seems too dim in the daylight.
1,Not bright enough,A great idea but the lasers are not bright enough for daytime use. Lasers are flimsy and have a very limited range of motion for aiming.
2,Half Fast Egineering,"It shouldn't have been much of a challenge to engineer enough spread of the two LED's to fuction with two cars side by side in the garage. Maybe if I had a 20' ceiling it would work, assuming the LED's were bright enough. I haven't tried turning the unit 90 degrees yet, but that seems like a probable solution. If I had read the reivews I probably wouldn't have bought it. Besides, my wife doesn't pay any attention to it anyway. I think I can attach a taser to it though."
2,"Serious design flaw....be ready to ""rig"" this","Something so simple really screws this item. Unless you have an abnormally high ceilings in your garage which most people do not, you will not be able to point (aim) the 2 lasers at your cars because they will not spread wide enough. A ridiculous flaw. I had to use a sharp blade to cut the plastic ""rim"" that restricts the motion of each arm. Tricky b/c of you are cutting plastic in a small awkward area. Yes, I cut my finger. You""ll know what I mean when you see it. Good luck.Other than this, once you can use it, it works great."
5,Make Parking in a tight space easier.,"This helps a lot in my garage. I have a two car garage, but like everyone out there I have more than just two cars in this space. Bikes, Xmas decorations, other storage, Tools, lawnmower ect.... this makes it easy to park in the right spot and not ding up my bumpers and doors."
2,parking light,"I purchased this item to keep me from hitting the front end of the car, but it does not work well at all in any type of light. At night, it works good still not great but at least you can get parked. The beam needs to be stronger and larger. One side turns off prior to the other side.I would not reccommend this item."
1,Item is JUNK!!,The laser stopped working a few minutes after it was installed. The first laser became very dim right away and the other did the same after several minutes. Don't waste your money or time. I requested an RMA the same day I received it..
3,So-so parking aid,"The price was right, but there are a couple of problems with this device. As others have mentioned, the lasers cannot be aimed to cover two cars. I had to modify them by filing down some plastic to accomplish that. The second problem is that they don't always turn on when I pull the car in (maybe 20% of the time).Even so, they were worth the twelve bucks I spent. At least 80% of the time now, they provide nice guidance when parking."
1,Motion detector works poorly,The motion detector does not sense garage door opening or car moving in. I have to wave my hands right underneath the detector to turn the lasers on. This particular unit is useless.
5,best in its class!,"I've had lots of ""garage positioning systems""--from tennis balls dangling on strings to stoplight systems on the wall--and this is by far the best of them.It's more of a pain to put up, but when it's operational it's great!"
1,hated it,absolutely the worst thing i ever bought it is not bright enough to even see terrible product do not buy
1,garage parking laser,Arrived almost dead on arrival worked three times during installation test and then died very light weight and cheaply built of light plastic
2,Returned,This item was returned. It was not as expected when I opened the package. I will look for another style.
3,Dual Garage Laser Parking System,Received two units. One unit did not work. The unit has two lasers. One was extremely weak. I returned it and received full credit without any problems. The other unit was easy to install and works fine.
1,Broke in 2 months!!,Thing stopped working in 2 months!! Amazon return window is only 1 month now - a waste of time and money. Stay away!!!
5,Works very well,The unit works exactly as I expected. It was easy to set up and adjust and it sure beats the tennis ball on a string. You can park within an inch or two of where you want to be very easily.The price was excellent and the delivery rapid.
1,Does not work,This is my second time buying this item.It worked for the first five minutes then it turned off.I would not wast my money.Look for a different brand.I do not even know if I can return it or even how to return it and get my money back.
3,"Handy, but not quite 'right'","I have a four-car garage load with a two-car garage reality. Two cars, a motorcycle, tool cabinets, workbenches, ceiling mounted storage racks, etc., so space (and the ability to park very precisely) is very important.I've tried the dangling ball, the parking 'hump', the stop light, none of which by themselves get me parked with precision time after time. This little gadget did the trick, but only when combined with one of the dangly balls to line up properly. It does its job, however.My only complaints in that the little arms on the laser modules do not have enough 'backwards' adjustment. It needs about another 30% of swing for best adjustment, at least for my application. For now its cheap, and it works.For those worrying about the motion-sensor bit. It is VERY sensitive. If you are in your garage working it will stay on the whole time you are there. Even a tiny bit of arm movement sets it off. It does, however, shut down very reliably. No issues in that regard."
1,Fooled me twice...,"I first bought the Maxsa version of this device (virtually identical to the Sierra, clearly the same manufacturer). All was well at first, both lights nice and bright. But after only two weeks, one of the laser lights went dim. It still comes on, but not nearly bright enough to be of use. Since we liked the system during the short time it worked, we decided to roll the dice again, hoping for a better outcome with the Sierra version. Guess what, the EXACT same thing happened (one light on, but too dim to be of use), but this time time it happened DURING THE INITIAL AIMING PROCESS! So, I now have two of these things installed in my garage, each of them with only half of it working.This version has an additional problem, BTW-- it doesn't come on until too late, and doesn't stay on long enough. Don't waste your money."
2,limitations,Be careful if you have a wide garage. I mounted the unit in the center of my garage. I wasn't able to spread the laser wide enough apart to accomodate two cars. I ended up breaking off one of the lasers in the process.
2,Cars need to be parked too close for laser beams to hit both,"Limited pivot range on lasers is a major drawback. Even when mounting the unit mid-point between both cars it was unable to reach both dashboards. And my vehicles are parked at a normal distance (if you fully open door of either vechicle there's about 6-12"" space to the other).I had to return the unit."
2,Mediocre product,"This product is in the lower price range of laser parking assist systems. You get what you pay for. It has an easy mount using three screws and a plate that the unit mounts onto. All three screws stripped when screwing them into a wood stud in my garage. Had to use my own wood screws. The two lasers have a very limited range of motion. I was unable to point either of them exactly where I wanted. I had to mount the unit so that one of the lasers would aim exacty where I wanted, and then for my other car I had to make the best of where it would point. Sideways motion is very limited. The sensor turns off to quickly when the cars are close to the unit. If I was to purchase again I would consider one of the other laser systems."
3,Works with limitations then stopped after 3 months,"I bought this for one vehicle to be parked outside my garage but as close as possible so as to not block sidewalk and not hit garage door. It worked well in the dark but was very hard to see in broad daylight. But for the price it was worthwhile while it lasted. However after 3 months it just stopped. I discovered it would work on the back up battery (which only lasts a day or two), but when plugged in to the AC adapter would not work at all, even if the adapter was not plugged in to electrical outlet, i.e. problem inside the laser mount.Basically, great idea, use at your own risk, or find a better made equivilent."
3,Pretty good but a little crowded.,"I like this CD, it's great to hear the old tunes with new energy. The sax player reminds me of the guy from Saturday Night Live. I dunno if that's a good thing. Phil & Bobby sound awesome, though Mickey is somewhat lost in the mix. The guitar players seem to be fighting for space all the time, to me, there just seems to be too much going on sometimes. A good disc though and definitely worth a spot in your collection."
5,HUBBA HUBBA,"Ok... Jerry's gone... Who's that on keyboard's? Bruce Hornsby? Holy Samoly!! ""White Wheeled Limousine"" and ""Rainbow's Cadillac"" rock and go outside what The Dead usually play. Saint Steven and The Eleven are the best they've played in ages.Overall, incredible and fantastic. One of the best shows I've ever been to. Stunning....... Good God Almighty Lord Talk To Me Now!!!"
5,A welcome revision of the good ol' Grateful Dead,"Deadheads rejoice! If you weren't able to catch the all too brief ""Other Ones"" tour last summer, this 2 disc set provides a snapshot of the magic and synergy that escaped the previous Further Festivals. This is not merely a re-hash of what used to be but rather a much needed update played with passion and love by musicians who were of ""the groupmind"" and complemented each other rather than individuals trying to sound like a band. This was not a band imitating the Grateful Dead but one that has its own identity and sound. There are no single highlights on this set as it represents the highlights of the last 10 shows played. The sound is impeccable with the mix showcasing each players ""chops"" and what is amazing is how it all sounds so natural. This will feature prominently in my multi-disc player for long time."
5,Game Journalist's review,"This game is so much fun and it has so much opportunities for beating it!So much variations of stuff!It's an awesome, especially for a Russian game!"
2,No good!,"This book is nothing more than the published glorification of the Chihuahua breed. Not in-depth at all and has absolutely no value to someone who wants to take SERIOUS care of the animal. Might as well title it ""The Essential Dog"". Very general look at caring for dogs - as a whole! ""Essentially"" an unnecessary purchase."
3,Does not rise to the level of Westinghouse himself,"""George Westinghouse: His Life and Achievements"" by Francis E. Leupp is a very glowing account of this remarkable inventor and industrialist. Lacking the annotation of a definitive biography, its value as an historic work is somewhat questionable. It is often hard to tell whether the author is relating firsthand accounts or possibly romanticizing events. The slightly awkward text is also short on factual detail and historic tie-ins, and though a story reasonably told, will not satisfy the more serious-minded history student. Though Leupp's work does have some interesting photographs, ""A Life of George Westinghouse"" by Henry G. Prout appears to be more detailed and scientifically oriented, though it also lacks attributable sources."
4,Nice wire,It works great. I gave it 4 stars only because it is a pain to strip off the outer cover to get to the 2 wires. Great wire though!
3,Why does Monster hide the Gauge?,"I agree with Sam, Monster goes out of its way to advertise its brand, but when you look at their package, the wire gauge rating is hidden. Why is that? All wiring has to meet industry standards as to gauge. It is the most fundamental deciding factor in choosing wire.Standing in Home Depot and doing a side by side comparison, all other brands list their gauge clearly on the packaging except Monster - and Monster is more expensive. Don't be duped. You need a large gauge wire but you don't need to pay for Monster advertising.There is so much more that goes into great sound. The shape of your room, the acoustic absorption of your furniture and drapes, the angle of the speakers, the quality of your speakers, the quality of your amp and the quality of the source of the music itself."
5,A modern classic,"I happened to find this book at a time when the Dark Night had all but swamped me, and it was a lifeline! Burrows has been a Carmelite nun for many years, and has been a teacher of young nuns. She obviously has an inquiring mind, too, and studied the great Carmelite writers, John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila, Therese of Lisieux. How well she describes the path we must follow if we hope to rest in God!If you have recently started on this journey, read the book for inspiration, and keep it to reread as you move along. If you are a very old hand at prayer, look into it for courage and clarity. It is one of the great ones.Review by Janet Knori, author of Awakening in God"
2,English book,"Maybe the advice in this book is helpful in England, where the best man speech apparently is a very different custom, but most Americans following this advice would make fools of themselves. Mr. Bowden wants to make the best man a stand-up comic, which few people can successfully pull off. Moreover, the suggested jabs at the groom and sexual innuendo are entirely inappropriate at most weddings where older relatives are present. The three model speeches at the back of the book will make you cringe. Probably not a bad book if you have that famous English wit and will be giving the speech in the UK. But the book will be disappointing to most Americans who hope mostly to honor their friends, bring a tear to a few eyes, not come off as a jerk, and get to the bar as soon as possible."
3,The Paris Division,"This is the soundtrack to the third OVA (Original Video Animation), and featues the Paris division of the Flower Division.As such, it features more BG (background music) then other cds of this series, and perhaps three actial vocal performances, of wich track 15, is the best, in my opion.Don't buy unless your intrested in the Flower Divsion Paris, as I did. This is a strong cd, just lacking in vocal songs, and should apeal to actial fans of this video series, someone who is familiour with this series of videos, and the like.."
4,Poeta Cartola,"This is a must have for the samba fans. ""Verde Que Te Rosa"", ""Tempos Idos"", ""Pranto De Poeta"" and ""Nós Dois"" are some of the great compositons of Cartola."
3,Can't fly w/o the manual.......,"I have owned this flight sim for about 6 months now. My biggest complaint is that the user's manual included is all technical about how to make and create planes and not on flying. Also limited info on how to use buttons at top of flight sim while flying. If you were a novice on flying, you would be lost. I learned by trial and error. It also helped that I also have MS Flight Sim 2000, so I could at least fly. Customer support is lacking, seems like its run by IQ's of 200 at age 7. If they are going to update, they need to make avail discs for backup as downloads do not work most of the time."
2,Game is too ugly and buggy,"I will admit that graphics are pretty important for me and I am quite excited about the upcoming Flight Simulator 2002 which looks like it is going to have ground breaking graphics. In contrast, X-Plane features graphics that are undeniably stuck in 1995. The terrain models are horrible up close and far away and the instrument panels are very low color 2d monstrosities. If graphics are important to you too, then don't even think about playing this game without first downloading the demo. As for talk about the flight model being realistic -- I find that the planes are easier to fly in X-Plane than in MSFS2000 which I also find more boring."
2,computer bugs,"I recently purchased the latest version of this software. My initial impression of the sim was very favorable. When I tried to exit the program my PC (Dell PIII 933, nvidia TNT2 graphics card)consistently froze. After getting no response from the technical service either by phone or email I finally called the designer. The standard response was the video driver was not correct even though it is the one they recommend. As of now I am still not able to get the program to run well. My advice to any considering this purchase is if the program runs well, great, but if it does not do not expect alot of help from the manufacturer."
1,Could of done better!,"I got the game at the stare it looked pretty cool with the Nasa sapce shuttle reentry,but when i installed it the frame rates were very low I couldnt get off the ground,Plus my computer is 700 mhz ,128 mb ram ,amd processor, and still went slow!, i recommend buy this game if u have a really fast computer otherwise go with Microsft Flight sim 2000 ,the game is awesome exept less planes, better frame rates, no atc!"
3,BIG LET DOWN,I STARTED OFF WITH FS 98 THEN I GOT FS 2000 AND LATELY BOUGHT FS 2002.NOW I MADE A MISTAKE AND BOUGHT X PLANE WHICH IS RUBBISH COMPARED WITH FS 2002. THE GRAPHICS AND SCENERY ETC IN FS 20002 ARE FAR SUPERIOR TO X PLANE. AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED X PLANE DOES NOT GET OFF THE GROUND. IF YOU BUY ONLY ONE FLIGHT SIM GET THE BEST MICROSOFT FLIGHT SIM 2002 WHY SETTLE FOR AN INFERIOR VERSION.CHECK THE DEMOS AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
3,"Great Sim, But Flawed","This is a terrific flight simulator, but it has some serious flaws. Because the world is modeled as flat, long flights do not function properly. Distant bearings are often not correct, one can't fly over the dateline, and worst of all, the ground shakes violently after significant distances are flown. In addition, though the flight model is vastly better than most sims, there are problems in the flight model that prevent acrobatic manuvers in planes that should should be able to handel them (loops don't work well at all). Finaly, the scenery is bland and although there are tools to improve it, the tools are themselves quite limited. There is hope, though, because Laminar Research is constantly adding to and fixing X-Plane. Perhaps a round world and acrobatics are in X-Plane's future. Only the developer knows for sure."
3,why bother,This book is all about small silly items that really don't make a bit of difference when compaired with a day in the Iraq war.
4,One of the Best From '31,"I was surprised to find this old classic on disk. It sounds better than the old, scratched LP ever did."
5,Any one that uses Depend products should know about Booster,"After my stroke I was left incontinent, and was forced to wear protective underwear 24/7 I tried different brands, I liked the Depend the best and the use of a depend boost liner pad for all day comfort. The first time I used one it felt strange, but after I got used to them they felt good they sure absorb a lot. I wear depend super absorbent or depend refastenable underwear. I like to wear the refastenable underwear with a booster pad the best.I would highly recommend them.Any one that uses Depend products should know about Booster Liners."
4,Mommy of two.,If your toddler has an adult sized bladder then this is for you. Boost inserts work well inside a toddler diaper to help prevent the soaked through diaper in the middle of the night phenomena. We all get a better night sleep. They would be better for this application if they didn't have the stick strip on the bottom but otherwise a good use of this adult product.
2,Too small for the #16 Depends,As I write this I am into my second day of these Insertsbut I find them too small for the Depends I use. waterstill go off to the side and you have to change yourdepends regular.Vaughn W. Myers
3,Booster Inserts,"More adhesive PLEASE! Nearly every time I prepare diaper for my 97 year old father the booster moves out of place while pulling up his pants. That said, I am unaware of any replacement product which is superior."
1,Dissaponiting Arabella,"Julia Kleita is absolutely great in the role of Zdenka both for her acting and her singing/character. Flemming on the other hand brings nothing in the way of style to this great score. Where are the vocal colorings and that special Vienna style? And she's clumsy looking in that modern(!??) production. She (Flemming) is beautiful but for me it's all about the music. There's no better Arabella in the last 10 or 15 years than Kiri Te Kanawa.You can see it on video with a superb cast in a super production. Here's a big production that never losses the essence of Strauss' intimate play. And if we're all lucky we will eventually see the Lisa Della Casa/Fischer-Dieskau from the 1950s, (While we wait you can catch a glimps on You Tube)."
5,Description,"'French photographer Bodilis seeks his subjects through chance meetings. The heroes of his photos are 'real' men. Whether they are portrayed alone or in groups, the air always crackles with eroticism - Parisian men in all their splendor.'"
4,Sex in B&W photographs.,"This Edition Euros book, like most of them, is filled with B&W images which are my favourite. Colour takes away some of what you can add with your imagination.Bodilis, a French photographer, has managed to piece together a collection of erotically charged photographs of men who are extremely sexy yet who are not the standard ""perfect"" form. Some images are solos and some are duos.Not the best in the series, but Edition Euros remain amongs the very best of books presenting the male form in sexy photo images ate an affordable price. As usual, the printing and binding are first-class."
3,Mostly Standard Images!,"Again, I have the same problem with this book of black & white images of male nude models as I did with the other's in the Edition Euros Series. I would like to know more about the photographer, Herve Bodilis, and his work. Again, there is no biography of the photographer. That aside, these are standard images of guys alone, some nude, and a few very erotic images of guys together. These are not all pretty guys, and perfect models, but everyday real men. I enjoyed this photographer's work, and have added it to my collection. However, if I had only one or two of the Euros Series books to select & buy, this wouldn't be it."
4,Tribal Stragety,"A good study of emotional, tribal trends that shape our world. Says a big problem is people losing their triibal idenity. I'm saying ""tribe"" but the author writes in bigger generalities than ""tribe."" Predicts how some problems will play out and sounds valid. A good reference that avoids tech. and science extrapolations but still predicts how humans will react (and have always reacted) to the vast changes all of us are experiencing. Hard reading so don't expect to skim this one. You will have to work to get the author's messages. But it is worth the work if you are interested in future trends."
3,well...,"This was based off of a great play. However this movie was kind of bad and did not reflect well on the play. But i guess i should say something good considering i do like this movie. Well Benetha, Ruth, Travis, and Mama(Lena) were very good. BUT WALTER PLAYED BY P-DIDDY! WAS TERBILE! I LOVED THE PLAY!!!!! However he ruined the chataer of walter. He is terrbile. When he is sad he seems happy, when he is happy he seems sad P-Diddy should never get a job again. Plus Ausagi was looking like he was rich which he was not really and i did not picture him walking around in suits. Also the great speech the Benitha gave about why she wanted to be a doctor was not in it which made me so sad becuse that was one of my favriote parts."
2,Great Film Except for One Actor Who I Think Should Stick To Rapping,"It's just what I said in my title, this is a great film but Puffy ruined it for me, so I returned my copy. I don't want to put people in boxes, but in this case Puffy should stick to rapping and leave acting for the professionals. It's a movie about segregation, prejudice, love, unity, and squandering money. I noticed a Nigerian actor. It made me glad because the character he was teaching his language (yoruba) connected to us. It's just like I said in my review for Love and Basketball about yams showing connection and just like I said in my review for Yes Man, there are other languages to learn out there."
1,YUK!!!,"Were we all watching the same program??? Someone must owe S. Combs big time for allowing this EXTREMELY DREADFUL adaptation of this classic to be released for purchase. Like another reviewer, I tunned in to see Rashads' critically-acclaimed take on the role of Lena Younger and I could not believe how someone so talented could be so unconvincing. The whole movie in a nut-shell is....Just awful.Do yourself a favor and try and find a copy of the now OOP American Play House version starring Danny Glover & Esther Rolle....this performace is what true/committed acting is all about."
4,African-American Actresses Shine,"This new production of the classic play is amazing for the treasure it presents: three of the finest performances one could ever see. Phylicia Rashad's Mama captures the essence of this stoic woman; Sanaa Lathan's Beneatha is sassy and bold; Audra McDonald once again proves that she is one of the finest performers working today. This film, an adaptation of the Broadway production, is well worth watching. Sean Combs, unfortunately, doesn't have the acting chops to carry the film as Sydney Poitier and Danny Glover do in earlier versions. But the saving grace is that Combs's Walter Lee is passable. With the strength of the female performances, this is definitely a production that satisfies."
2,Puffy vs. Sidney - Sidney wins by a mile,"I bought this film to show my 10th grade English class after we finished reading the play. I thought this version might better hold my students attention since it is in color and stars Sean Combs. While the three women do a great job, Sean Combs seems sedated in his role as Walter. He just doesn't have that powder keg ready to explode energy that Sidney Poitier brought to the role. Also for teaching purposes, I would highly recommend showing the Sidney Poitier version. It sticks much closer to the original play. The new version has some unnecessary extra scenes that I assume were added just to get the film out of the apartment."
3,inferior to 1961 version,"This version is inferior to the 1961 Sidney Poitier version in almost every way. Even my 10th grade urban English classroom, all of whom at first wanted to see the ""color"" version, agreed--acting, directing, even quality of subtitling for hearing impaired was very disappointing when compared to the b/w Sidney Poitier 1961 version. If this is the only version you can find, it's better than nothing--it's a watchable version of an incredible play. But if you want the best...I've made myself clear. I, who already had the 1961 version on DVD, wish I hadn't picked this one up without having seen some of it first. I'd have saved myself some money."
5,"Michigan Teachers, rejoice!","I teach in Michigan, and the 10th grade curriculum uses RITS as one of its main texts. I really love the play, and this version does a great job showing it on film. All the actors do a great job. One of my students commented, ""I can't believe that's P. Diddy - I can't take my eyes off it."" Enough said. Have your media center order this or get it yourself for your classroom."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"With an in-store and mail-in rebate I was able to purchase this burner for ($). What a mistake that turned out to be. It installed easily and performed well for about one week. After that the CD's I burned would either (1) not be recognized by any CD player or (2) sound very distorted and garbled when played. I tried IOmagics online support, phone support, and support forum. None of the suggested fixes worked. Want more horror stories - go to the IOmagic support forum and read the nightmares owners are having with this product. If you buy this item please call me - I have an old 8-track tape player I would like to sell you."
1,Piece of junk,"Probably the worst CDRW I have ever had the misfortune of using. I have experienced the same issues as the other reviewers. None of the CDs which were supposedly burned successfully are recognized in any drive. Even when it did work (which was not long) it said it was burning at 48x, but it took it almost 15 minutes to burn a cd. If you are thinking about buying this burner, you might as well go ahead and throw your money in the garbage..."
1,"One of Them, Indeed","When they came up with the title, if the filmmakers meant the seemingly endless stock of poor genre films that are being pumped out in the wake of digital film-making, then this is indeed ""one of them"". This cheap, irritating and boring ""horror"" film tries to be a combination of Final Destination and the Skulls.Viewers are treated to horrible lighting and dismal video quality. The plot, such as it is, concerns a bunch of teenagers who are being hunted by other dead teenagers. I wish I could be more specific, but the story was so confusing and badly written that I am hard pressed to tell you what this movie was about. I just wish that I had bypassed this one altogether."
3,"Warm and Fuzzy, Not too heavy","This book is full of very short, most just a page or a little more, happy adoption stories. After reading each little story I felt like, ""Is that it?"" I really wanted to know more. If you're looking for easy-light reading that will make you feel good, then this is the book for you. If you are interested in more indepth stories or issues surrounding adoption, then this book will probably disapoint you."
3,"great for mice,hamster gerbil. NOT for a rat","this cage looks like a wonderful place for mice, hamsters, gerbils. But once past 4-5 weeks rats would be to large for the house, the wheel, just too big for the cage I WOULD RECCOMEND FOR SMALL rodents but not a rat or larger"
4,"Wacky Races, a wacky game","Wacky Races is cool. 4 racers aren't in this game. The ones that are in this game are Peter Perfect, Gruesome Twosome, Sergent, Penelope Pitstop, Red Max, The Slag Brothers, and Dick Dastardly and his dog Muttley. Unfortulently, Dick Dastardly is not one of the racers you can choose from, but is in the races. There is a lot of tracks. There are shortcuts in most tracks. You can race in a singe race, a championship, or you can practice. There are weapons and mobility."

You can race in a singe race, a championship, or you can practice."
2,Disappointing...,"While some of the reviews for this book create a tremendous level of intrigue, the book itself falls flat. McCarthy's writing style is just not enough to sustain any interest for the characters or plots surrounding their lives. There was no desire to learn what happened to these women; the only reason I kept reading was for a book club.I would say that the only interesting thing about this novel (and the reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1) is that it gives the reader great insight into life as it was of the '30s to '50s. Not having been born during those periods, that was very interesting to experience. However, the social analysis is not enough to keep the book alive.I would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Difficult to follow...,This book did not hold my interest. It was very difficult to follow. I hung in there for almost 1/2 of the book and gave up.
3,OK Book,I think this book was written partly for the shock value in the early 60s. It seems to be me much of it is dribble. Its hard to phantom that women in their early 20s would be so naive about sex. I can't beleive I managed to read through a discourse on the logistics of keeping and storing a diaphram(sp) without getting nauseated. Then I was treated to another character justifying her affair with her friend's husband because her own husband was impotent. Allegedly he was impotent because he thought of his wife as a good girl. If that were the case she should have listened to her friend and told him what she was doing behind his back - that would have cured him. The book could have done without the discourse on breastfeeding. I got the impression that most of these women were stuck up spoiled rich kids. For the most part these educated women had the most atrocious choice of men. Only Polly finally found a decent man. It is a book I won't pick up to read again.
5,A joy!,"The real pleasure of this book is in Mary McCarthy's use of language. Her turns of phrase and sharp descriptions make one long for a more literate world. Add to this her wicked insights into the vanished mores of the 1930s Eastern Seabord elite and you have a fun read. This is probably the best written of the whole ""growing up in the Ivy League"" canon, i.e. Last Convertible, Class Reunion, Superior Women, Love Story, etc."
3,"Breast Feeding, Potty Training, Contraception and Sex in 1930's New York","Published in 1963, The Group charts the fortunes of eight graduates from 1933 to 1940. Reading this book in 2010 it is great social history but the confusing delivery where characters were left out for great stretches at a time meant that I found it difficult to remember which events had happened to which character. I am sure a second reading would make it easier but the large chunks of the book on the merits of breast feeding to bottle feeding, contraception, potty training are not of interest to me. However, I can understand why this book was so popular as it charts the embryonic stage of women embarking on careers and independent lives. It has also one of the most positvely wriiten accounts of a woman losing her virginity followed by an interesting denouement. A bit of a slog and it would surprise me if this book is read by a significant percentage of men."
4,"A solid invocation of a particular place, time, and class","I read this many, many years ago and had been intending to re-read it for awhile, just to see if it was as good as I remembered. The best parts of the book are the character exploration of the different girls -- their backgrounds, class contexts, ideas, etc., and the descriptions of New York City. In this regard, the book is a fascinating evocation of a past time in a great city. The plot is thin and predictable, but okay."
5,Fascinating story ~ a tale of a forgotten way of life,This book is a very informative look at pre-womens' liberation life in the United States. The characters are well-formed and the lessons learned through them are valuable. An excellent book for a discussion group.
4,Relationships and History,"Loved this book and the details brought to life of times gone by, a real trip back to cinch belts and love notes.Life was innocent but we were still dealing with wild life issues. Mary McCarthy has been an inspiration to my own writing and I appreciate her talent and skill. Great read! Linda Loveland Reid, author of Touch of Magenta."
3,Too slick,"""hard, raw blues in a style that only he can claim."" Really? Are we listening to the same album? Honestly, this sounds pretty good, it's just that I have trouble finding James Blood Ulmer on it. His jagged, quirky style is overwhelmed by Bill Laswell's slick production. He sounds like a sideman on his own album. The ""blue"" in the title would lead you to believe that this is in the same vein as ""Memphis Blood"" or ""No Escape From The Blues"", but there is only a little blues influence. Its mostly funk, and pretty good at that. But I expected a James Blood Ulmer album rather than a Bill Laswell album."
4,Old fashion country,Ms Bogguss has a beautiful and lyrical singing voice and sings in the old fashion western style. None of the new western singers sing in this style.
5,The voice of an angel - long overdue,"I will take this CD over Martina McBride's and I love Martina's CD. This is the best. I rated Martina's my 3rd favorite behind John Denver's and Vince Gill's but I think this moves up to number 1. Yes Two Step is on it and it should be. It's not the version with Michael Murphy. This is the original, re-done but she didn't change anything. Christmas Through Youe Eyes is a great original song and Baby, It's Cold Outside is one of my favorites. You know how everybody always ""screams"" on that one part of Oh Holy Night, not Suzy. I'd give this 10 stars if I could. The voice of an angel!"
5,Very Durable,I have had this bag for three years and it has really stood up to almost daily use. Holds pretty much everything a League player needs.
4,"Good book, but get from Borders for $2.99","This Thai cookbook has a lot of good dishes containing your traditional Thai fare from curries to noodles to desserts. Lots of illustrations and tips are included. Speaking of tips... I got this book at a local Borders Bookstore at the discounted book aisle for 2.99-Great cookbook, but no need to pay twenty bucks."
1,Charged for a FREE PROFESSIONAL COPY!! NOT HAPPY,"IF I HAD THE TIME TO RETURN AND WAIT FOR ANOTHER BOOK TO COME TO ME, I WOULD HAVE! I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU ALLOW PEOPLE TO SELL A FREE COPY TO UNSUSPECTED STUDENTS! JUST GOING ON THE TITLE IS NOT ENOUGH, I SUPPOSE!LEARNED MY LESSON WELL!!INFANTS, TODDLERS, AND CAREGIVERS FREE PROFESSIONAL COPY WAS CLEARLY PUT ON THE FRONT WITH THIS IS NOT FOR SALE ON THE BACK! WHAT MORE COULD YOU ASK FOR?"
4,First album from Brazil's first reggae band.,"Very pollitical album from the first reggae band from Brazil.Even though it is a short album (it only has nine songs), you can't help it to turn all of them up to the highest volume acceptable in your nighborhood. All songs were written by the band, except ""Nada Mudou"" which is an adaptation of Winston Foster's ""Jah Jah Made Us For a Purpose"" in which the drummer Lazo takes the lead vocals. Also has a guest appereance from Jimi Cliff on ""Mensagem"".A classic from Brazil top reggae band."
3,A love story to sing about,"Young Felimid was cast out for a year in the effort of erasing a blood-feud. The one year stretched into many, as the world jumped up at the bard and never let him go. After becoming the lover of a pirate queen, Felimid postponed his return home for her sake. But the promise to join him on his way home could never be fulfilled, as her enemies gathered forces and laid siege to the pirates' stronghold. When, conquered and shamed, Gudrun dies, Felimid expects to die too - for he was the one that stood by her to the bitter end.To him, the silver-tongued bard, fate must show a crueler face: he's to live only if he can charm the raising waves of the coming tide with his song... But Gudrun bade him live to sing of her, and this promise he'll try with everything he has, to fulfill.A nice, sad, romantic fantasy. Recommended for those who appreciate Irish fantasy."
3,Worked as advertised,"Well, I found this pretty cheap on Amazon, so it wasn't a huge investment. The data transfer rate is painfully slow, but it works. HOWEVER, I'm really irritated that they didn't include this with the calculator. It's a basic thing which should by any modern standard be bundled with it."
3,Dispensable,"The TI graph calculators already bring one, so its not entirely necessary to get one, unless you think you need a backup."
4,"It does the job, but kind of confusing.","Not much to say, it does the job... but it isn't very clear on how to use it. I expected to plug in my calculator and click ""Update software"" and be done with it, but it isn't that easy."
2,"For now atleast, go with the black serial cable.","Pros of the USB: This is alot simpler, and quicker to use, and the data transfer is faster when you use usb.Cons: The cable came with my TI-83 plus silver edition. I read about all hte programs i could use on my computer to trasnfer stuff to my calculator ok. And I find the flip card program, it's like a digital verison of writing stuff you need to memorize on teh back and front of a note card and flipping it over. Well I get home and hook up the USB cable, and I find that almost all the programs i want to use can't use a USB cable. It was really agrivation. It just asks what ""Com port"" you want. And obviously i wnat usb...So the only good for the usb connectivity cable is to upgrade your calculators software and a few other small things. Nothing useful. Maybe they'll upgrade the programs later ot use the USB..."
2,A PAIN TO INSTALL,"I bought this to add the stats program to my ti-89. First of all, the enclosed CD only comes with software for the 83 and 84 even though the outside states that it's good for a wide range of TI's. After I managed to download the driver from the website, it would not recognize my calculator. I complained to Texas Instruments and got no response for help. After checking Google and using at least 10 different troubleshooting techniques, I finally discovered that most NEED A PATCH TO RUN FROM WINDOWS VISTA. After installing the patch, you need to reboot. I would've been happy if the TI people could at least have gotten back to me about my problem so I would've had the calculator set up in time for my exam. I didn't have 50 hours to spend tracking down drivers for a USB connection."
1,soft ware that does not work,I bought this item because the price was good. I wasted my money as the soft ware included didn't work. It was out of date and we were unable to update it. We have never used this product
4,graphlink,This item is great. It allows my daughter to uplink through her TI calculator and download.
4,Ti 183 part,I was please with the quickness that this cable was delivered & what all it allows me to do with the calculator. I wish I could understand why this is not included with the calculator's original purchase. It would at least be nice to have the cable available in office supply stores. But Amazon & TI made it simple enough after the fact that those are just minor concerns. Good product & I recommend having it if you need to use these types of calculators a lot.
4,Very nice to have accessory for your TI calculator,"This is a very nice accessory to have for your TI calculator.The only catch is that while the cableand related software will work with a large number of TI-Calculators the software on the CD isonly compatible with a few of them. If you have one of the calculators not listed in the installeryou will need to go to the TI website and download the right software from there. The softwareincluded with the cable should really explicitly cover all the caluclator models that are actuallysupported!That said, once you get the software installed having the ability to edit data, take screen-shots, etc from your computer is really nice!"
4,TI-Silver-USB to serial calculator link,"The actual hardware works great. Just plug it in to your TI-83and your computer. Now, the TI Connect software is a differentmatter. NOT INTUITIVE AT ALL."
4,Works as advertised,I found that this item works as advertised. I did have to download the software from the website as the CD they sent was out dated. I've also found the links in the software to be broken. This can be easy fixed with a quick google search.
4,TI Graph Link,"I used The product with my TI-89, upgraded the firmware and downloaded a finance app that saved me from needing to purchase a separate financial calculator for my graduate Finance class. Worked like a champ!"
3,It works,I purchased the graphlink USB to replace my old serial graphlink. It works with TI connect software on XP32 bit and Vista 32 bit. It would not work on XP 64 bit. The serial graphlink would not work with TI connect software on my old TI89. The new TI89 has a built in USB port so only people like me with old calculators can use it. It does work excellent!
5,A must-have for any student,"This has proved to be a very useful tool. Downloading programs and putting them on my calculator couldn't be any easier, and it saves me time when I am working problems in class, for homework, or on tests."
5,Great Product,"This is a very great product. It works with my Ti-83 plus calculator. I've had no problem downloading or uploading data from the calculator, and I love the clear design."
2,Better off with black graph link,"Because it is USB, it does not work eith TI-Graphlink software. Don't get me wrong the Graphlink software isn't great, but it is much more powerful than TI Connect. Plus you can use both TI Connect and TI-Graphlink software with the serial cables. The graph link software is rather clunky, but much more reliable than ti connect."
1,If you have Vista this product is worthless,Amazon.com and Texas Instruments fail to inform the consumer that the connectivity kit fot any of their TI calculators are not compatible with Windows Vista.Thanks for nothing.
1,Did not come with CD,"Package on the cable says it includes a CD, but there was no CD in the SEALED package. So yeah, purchase with caution."
5,TI Graphlink Cable,"CD it comes with is worthless... you have to download program from the TI webpage. I used this with my TI-83 PLUS and TI-89. The TI-89 will not sync until you complete a process of taking one battery out and turn it on by pressing a certain button. You can google search it. I had some problems while trying to update the OS on the TI-89 until I found out you have to do it that way. I can tell a big difference and I was able to put some apps on the system to help with some classes I am taking. The previous OS on my TI-89 was from 1998, so it was due for an update."
4,Works well.. but.....,"This came packaged in retail packaging. CD, Instructions, etc. were all included as well. My issue with the whole deal, it does not work well with Macs. Well, I cannot say that for all, but i have a new Mac Mini. I installed the SW, checked for updates, and did various restarts. I cannot get my computer to see my calculator. I am running Mountain Lion, so that may have something to do with it, but you would think TI would have updated their SW to support it by now.I ended up using a Windows Laptop to take care of everything. Not a big deal, just a little upsetting"
1,Doesn't work with Mac OS X 10.6 or higher,"Enough said in title. You can search online to see all the forums discussing this, but Texas Instruments has not, and potentially will not, update their software to be able to work with Snow Leopard or later versions of OS X. It certainly does not work with Mountain Lion as I have been trying to connect for the last hour."
4,TI voyage Graphlink USB,I received the item on time and was what I expected. I needed an update cable with a USB connection. This unit worked well with the TI Voyage and my computer and met my expection.
2,short comings,"#1. Be careful, Amazon.com will try to trick you into separately purchasing this item when in fact it's already included in the TI calculator packages.#2. If you were expecting to download programs from your calculator to your PC with this device, like you used to do with Graph Link, FORGET IT !!!"
3,Buyer Beware,"Unfortunately, this is a necessary purchase for all those who buy TI-83 calculators. The product does what it has to do and very easily, but does not always work with your operating system. This item was purchased as a necessary requirement for my statistics class as we needed additional software for our book. I bought it and soon realized that TI has not updated its software to work with any Mac operating system above 10.5/10.6 (Leopard and Snow Leopard). I tired for hours to get this to work with my MacBook running Mountain Lion with no such luck and realized that I should try my old MacBook which was running Snow Leopard. It worked!So, beware if you run an operating system on Mac above Snow Leopard - it isn't going to work. I have heard that it does work on Windows up to Vista, but not always on Windows 7."
2,Misleading,"Under the technical details it says it, ""Includes TI Connect Software CD..."" This is simply not true. All I received was the cable."
2,Cannot write programs on PC,Old version (working with black serial port cable) has program editor. Writing programs with tiny screen and non-qwerty keyboard is extremely slow. With old cable/software it was possble to write and edit programs on PC and downlaod programs to the calculato. No more.I am still keeping old machine with serial port and using black cable. New cable/software is few steps backward
4,"Works great, but just to get useless programs?","The cable works great, easy to set up and all that jazz. I just don't (now) see the point of buying a cable just to download free useless programs. Perhaps the younger generation knows more about how to use the programs than I."
4,Pricey but Good,"My wife needed this to put some Stats programs on her TI-83+ so we purchased it. While I do think that ~$20 is a bit much for something like this, it was hard to find a reliable generic version of it. In my experience sometimes it is worth it to shell out a little more money for a product you know will work right out of the box."
4,Worked perfect.,"This product did exactly what it said it would do. If you are a student and have a handme down TI, this is a good product to keep your device up to date."
3,never tried it,"bought it just in case I wanted to upgrade software, I used it for one class and do not intend to go on with statistics so will never need it agin, nor the cord, perhaps I will sell it on ebay"
1,Does not work with new Operating Sytems!!! 2010/2011+,"I used to use this cord when I first got the calculator and it was a godsend, so since I lost it and am taking applied calculus II I thought I could definitely benefit from it again. However, after receiving it and wasting a few hours trying to make it work I contacted Texas Instruments, and they told me that the cord does not work with Mac OS X 10.6.8 and above or Windows 7. So unless you buy an old operating system this cord will not work with any new computer made within the last year. I was kind of disappointed that TI cares that little about their calculator customers and wish there was another brand that could keep up with TI but sadly they seem to have the monopoly :-("
1,not what I expected,This is incompatiable with Windows XP and the down loads do not work. Very poor marketing.
4,Black Balloon is a GREAT song!,"I love this song, it's one of the best ever by Goo Goo Dolls, I can't get enough of it!"
5,Early talkie has it all!!!,"Be yourself released on DVD by kino is a real early talkie treat! Has it all, great music, Fanny's singing and comic nature, boxing, great mugs and more. Robert armstrong is perfect in the role as a punch drunk boxer, and works well with fanny. If you are into early talkies this one is a fun one. A treat to see fanny in a film.Sound quality is good for an early talkie, print is not as could as other kino releases, but is very good for a film this rare. A must have for any fan of early sound films."
5,This is priceless,"This is a must have for movie buffs. Fanny Brice is funny, witty, and original. Her voice is something you will never forget."
3,Be Yourself starring Fanny Brice,"The movie is a bit dated as would be expected since it was released in 1930. I viewed the movie because I wanted to see Fanny Brice because I have been reading a biography of her. I found out how historically inaccurate ""Funny Girl"" is. I was very pleased to see Miss Brice's songs in this movie, but I was disappointed that it didn't have more of her comedy work."
5,U2's most underrated album,"This album is overlooked so much and is always so underrated, and that upsets me because it has some great music on it. The music and lyrics on this album are almost completely about the struggle U2 had in their early days with Christianity and Rock and Roll. And although that's probably one of the reasons why it's overlooked so much, it's also one of the reasons why it's great. The album opens with ""Gloria"", which has lyrics that are commonly mistaken as being Bono talking to a girl, but are really a reference to God. It is the most popular song on the album, and one of the best on it, but not the best. My favorite song on the album is ""Tomorrow"", a song that's about Bono's mother and Christianity. Other classics on the album are ""I Fall Down"", ""Fire"", ""Rejoice"", and the title track ""October"". This is the most underrated U2 album, and a lot of people consider it their worst work, but I don't. If you're a U2 fan at all, this album is a must-have."
3,Solid but does not compare to other U2 records,"This is probably U2's worst album. I enjoy all of U2's efforts but this one is the least appealing. I still like it but it doesn't have that classic quality most U2 albums do. Alot of the songs are forgettable but there are a few exceptions. Gloria is very enjoyable and highly spiritual as most songs are on this album. Tomorrow is an incredibly moving song probably the best on the record. It deals with Bono's loss of his mom. The song is haunting and very emotional. Other quality tracks include October, Scarlet, and Fire. I recommend the album but it isn't representative of U2's best work."
5,A CAPTURED SOUND AND TIME,"iV'E LIVED SORT OF A PARALLEL LIFE TO THE U2 BOYS,; AGE,RELIGION, MUSICIAN, CONFUSIONS, IDEALS, WORLD ISSUES,ETC.; AND EVERY TIME I LISTEN TO THE CD (OCCASIONALLY) ALL THOSE HAUNTING EMOTIONS OF MY EARLY YOUTH COME FORTH IN AN AWESOME FEELING, OR REVELATION. THESE GUYS WERE GREAT! THEY WERE NOT GREAT PLAYERS, THEY WERE GREAT THINKERS! THEY WERE NOT GREAT PLAYERS, THEY WERE GREAT MUSICIANS! THIS ALBUM CAPTURES THAT SOUND AND TIME OF WHEN MUSIC WAS BEING REBORN,RESHAPED, FROM ALL THE GREAT ARTISTS BEFORE THEM, WHO HAD GIVEN ALL THE INGREDIENTS OF THE PAST , TO DISCOVER THE NEW MOLD FOR THE FUTURE... U2 HAS CAPTURED THE SOUND AND SPIRIT OF TIME, AMEN...LET US PRAY"
2,Very forgettable,"This album is far from being great, or even good. It's one that only an avid fan would like, and quite passable. U2 has made better music, and October is definitely NOT even near their best."
2,The Forgotten Album,"A lot has been written about this album, some good, some bad. This album (by U2 standards)is mediocre. Bono says himself that if they were starting out today and they released this as a second album, they would be dropped by the record label. A few highlights here like 'Fire','Gloria' and maybe at a push 'October', but other than that, nothing to write home about. Steve Lillywhite's production is raw and uneventful and the recording was 'rushed'. It is true that Bono's lyrics were stolen prior to recording which put added pressure on the limited resources that they had at the time. One to complete the collection but will probably not hit the CD-player too often."
4,"Religious anthems dominate ""October"".","First let me say that I am an atheist. And I love this album.Usually religious songs get on my nerves. I immediately think, ""Propagandists!"" or something to that extent. But not on this album. Maybe it's just because I'm a huge U2 fan and I can see past the religious themes for their sake. But I have a feeling that's not it. This CD is truly a great work.Gloria is the opening track and one of my favourites on the CD and from U2 over all. I just love hearing The Edge on this track, as well as Larry Mullen's drums towards the end. I always sing along. Plus, there's Latin in it. :)skipping skip skip.Tomorrow, the 6th track, is my favourite on this CD. The melody is haunting, the lyrics are haunting (mentions of Bono's deceased mother are prominant) and the over all feel makes you want to run under the covers.October, the title track, is an 8-line, two-minute-or-so song which is among my favourites on this CD as well. The piano adds a beautiful touch as well."
3,"...and kingdoms fall, but you go on....","The song ""October"" is my very, very favorite U2 song, which is saying something because I have a lot of favorite U2 songs. ""October"" the song is too beautiful to describe. However, most of the rest of the album just doesn't do much for me. There's too much of Bono screaming ""Jesus coming!"" and I find my nerves jarred by the time the album is half over."
4,October,"October was the first tape I ever bought. Back in 1985, I knew I liked U2 from songs I was hearing on alternative rock stations back then, ""New Year's Day"" and ""Sunday Bloody Sunday""(almost every U2 song had the words ""day"" or ""tonight"" in them repeated rather often throughout! Maybe they are going back to that somewhat in their new ""Beautiful Day""!) So, I went out and bought this early work from them, and I fell in LOVE with U2, and it's still my favorite band to this day. Anyway, for me, this is a 5 star CD. But for someone who is not an angst-ridden teenager of Irish ancestry(partly at least), perhaps this will not hit you so personally and strongly as it hit me. So, for the public, I gave it 4. It is VERY Irish, especially my favorite, ""Tomorrow"", and also very religious.(But you don't have to be religious to buy it, you may hardly even notice it.) The melodies are beautiful, and as a whole the album is a work of art and an absolute must if you already like ""War"" and ""Boy""."
5,Speaking In Tongues Of Angels,"When asked where the inspiration for October's lyrics came from. Bono said ""Since I lost my lyrics I just went in and it was like I was speaking in tongues"" That is a sense capsules this work since it it raw from the soul and plays heavy into the idea of a mystic on a search for truth led by the spirit. With that said either you get it or you don't the album is much more than music, it is a picture of time in the life of a believer who has worn many faces of spirituality over the years."
2,Correct me if I'm wrong but...,...isn't this the first U2 album to make direct reference to the footnotes in the Dake Study Bible?
4,"Energetic, Spiritual","Although it doesn't have a lot of huge radio hits, 'October' is a very good U2 album. 'Gloria' may be the only song here that got considerable radio exposure, but several others should have.This is a very high energy collection with a spiritual theme running through it. The lyrics, vocals, and instrumental work all combine to make a very good effort.This is an album that was pretty much ignored in their first 'best of' collection, but there are some songs here that should have made the cut. I particularly like 'October' and 'Gloria'. Beyond those two, there are several others that will grow on you the more you listen to them. I recommend it."
4,The awakening of innocence,"I first heard this LP (as they were then!) as a 17 year old in 1981. I've lived the same length of a lifetime since then, but despite being older and a good deal more cynical, I can still never fail to be moved by ""October"". I think I was looking for the same things they were looking for, or so I thought at 17. I can still hear both anguish and innocence in songs like ""Tomorrow"", ""I fall down"", ""October"" and ""Stranger in a strange land"", and i gently laugh at myself, as the songs bring back memories of how callow and inexperienced with life I was. The 90's U2 is a splendid artistic machine, now that they've left the Joshua Tree pomposity behind. ""October"" is a picture of how the early 80's U2 were looking for clues in directions that no other bands were going in at the time."
4,Haven't Found...,"This CD is a hallmark creation of a band still finding its way. It's an interesting listen providing a glimpse into their development. Several songs on it stay with me, but most of them do not frequent my play lists."
2,This is not very funny,I purchased this book after watching the episodes on You Tube. The series is called the Unwritten Rules and it is hilarious however this book was not very funny and the author even went as far to say that her college English teacher told her that she did not have a talent for writing; she should have listened.But I do encourage you to check out and SUPPORT the You Tube project. It is a very positive and well produced show and I give much credit to Kim Williams for its success. >OoO<
2,Disapointment,"The only song I had heard off this album prior to buying it was the song ""disturbing behavior"", needless to say that song was a great social examination on materialism in the hip-hop community. Upon purchasing it I was so supremely disappointed by the album with the exception of ""disturbing behavior"" and two other tracks. Don't buy it, download it."
2,Micro Fiction: An Anthology of Really Short Stories,"I love very short stories, but found Micro Fiction a disappointment. Most of the stories were too abstract for me; stories not having a clear story line and some seeming to ramble on without much intent nor a conclusion.The editor must have found stories like these of interest to place so many together in one book.Other very short story book selections I've enjoyed are:1) ""The World's Shortest Stories of Love and Death: Passion, Betrayal, Suspicion, Revenge, All This and More in a New Collection of Amazing Short Stories-Each One Just 55 Words Long"" edited by Steve Moss;2) a second 55-word story book edited by Steve Moss;3)""Flash Fiction: Very Short Stories"" longer than the Micro Fictions selections, but less abstract4) Many of the Barnes and Noble short story book selections."
4,a fine text for the intro creative writing classroom,"Since I'm required to teach both poetry and fiction in my university intro class, this book provided a very logical bridge between the two genres and gave students excellent examples of how to sharpen their perception and language to fit a very small space. We've also enjoyed the variety of voices in this dynamite little text."
2,"Some good stories, Not a great Collection","There are some good things as well as some bad things about Micro Fiction. The good thing about this book is that it has variation in the texture and tone of the stories. My favorite would have to be Morning News which was written by the author himself. Also the author has managed to touch on many different subject matters. However the bad news is that many of the stories in the book are not very well written, some of it is formula fiction and I had trouble understanding the meaning behind a couple of them. The upside is that the book costs less than $20"
2,Too many stories that didn't make sense...,"I am a fan of micro-fiction, which, when it's written well, allows the reader to think about what he or she has read due to the cleverness and possibly the twist at the end. With that said, short stories (be they short films or literary short stories) are tough to write. Many stories that were chosen for this particular compilation don't make sense, or are very abstract, don't have a definitive beginning, middle, end, or characters a reader should care about. I was personally asking, ""And...?"" or ""What was the point?""Stories shouldn't do that.A few that did catch my attention, and felt ""done"" were:*Chickens by Elaine Magarrel(Chickens attempt to turn the hands of fate)*A Gentleman's C by Padget Powell(A college instructor who finds his aged father a student in his class gets revenge, but regrets it)The story by Powell doesn't have a beginning, middle, and end (or at least a begining and end, sans middle)...but it does comes off as an interesting ""anecdote."""
4,Very Tiny Fiction,"Micro fiction is a wonderful collection of extremely short stories, hence Micro Fiction. Contained within the small book are short stories submitted to Florida State University's World's Best Short Short Story contest. They range from serious to humorous and show the art of writing a really short story and all that this art form has to offer. Defiantly a recommended read for anyone dabbling in writing, because it forces the reader to consider another form of writing.Only a few tweaks could make this collection better. First, updating and releasing a second edition. Micro Fiction was published in 1996 so there are nine years of wonderful stories that aren't in it. Two, add more stories and make it a longer collection. The stories are short, under 250 words, so they don't take long to read. But it is a great collection of an commonly overlooked genre of writing. A must have for any writer."
4,not always easy to understand,"Most of the stories in this collection are rather esoteric.I'll comment on a few favorites, though:--""Wrong Channel"" by Roberto Fernandez is about a Hispanic immigrant who confuses TB with TV.--""All This"" by Joanne Avallon explains the cycle of child abuse in a single run-on sentence.--""Chickens"" by Elaine Magarrell is about a yardful of chickens whose lives are prolonged by a supernatural entity of their own species.--""Waiting"" by Peggy McNally is about a substitute teacher who finds it difficult to become engrossed in her work. Like ""All This,"" the story is reduced to one compound-complex sentence.The entire book can be read in a few hours."
5,A Great CD.,"Kathy Can Really Sing. She A Good Voice. I Like The Classic ""Eighteen Wheels And A Dozen Roses"". That Won A Single Of The Year Award. ""Where've You Been"" Is A Good Balled Too."
5,"Good Music, Great Words",I bought this album because I liked one song (Where've You Been)on it and was delighted with the rest of the album. These songs tug at your heartstrings. This is a must-have for Kathy Mattea fans old or new.
4,Nice Cd from excellent singersongwriter.,"This is a nice cd from B. Hewerdine and my first ""meeting""with his music. It was worth to listen to it and I put the cd in my player several times since I have it."
3,Historic House Museums,"In historic house museums, the author provided useful information and tips for the operation of a small museum on a shoestring budget. The authors extensive experience in the museum industry is evident from the suggestions offered. Many resources were listed for the museum staff to consider, however there are no web addresses which severely limits the usefulness of the book."
4,Good documentary but not sure I'd buy it again...,"This is well done documentary and very enjoyable, particularly the insight into the upbringing and family lives of the band. However I'm not sure if I'll actually ever watch it again and not sure it was worth purchasing for the price (a gift for my wife at Christmas)."
3,Ok,I think they could have done this documentary better. I thought we would see a little more into the bands history and how they became the great performers that they are. I still love them though =)
2,Dissappointed,They have truely come a long way. But I guess I was expecting a little different story about them. It was kind of trailer trashy.
3,Interesting . . . and frustrating,"I knew a bit of the Kings of Leon story prior to seeing this documentary. As a film, it works really well . . . remains interesting and enlightening throughout. But it's also a frustrating exercise as one can easily see that substance abuse WILL (not may, WILL) be the downfall of the young musicians. There's a reason so much of their family has remained poor. And if these guys don't change, they'll end up right back there with them, or worse. In interviews, the guys seem pretty self aware, but in fact their totally blind to their enslavement to alcohol. That's frustrating to see."
3,enlightening,I am taken aback by the humble beginnings and genuine simplicity of all the motivations that make this documentary so sincere and genuine.
3,Decent support,This product does it's job as far as taking pressure off your wrist and balances weight to the rest of your arm. I believe this product is WAY over priced after examining the quality. The quality is pretty good but NOT for $150. I think it should be around at least $60 after using the brace in the field. I've used the Glidecam HD-4000 without the brace and my wrist felt like it was going to break off so the brace does work.
4,WELL MADE,"JUST RECEIVED AND LIKE THE WAY It IS MADE AND BUILT WELL..THE POLE IS MUCH BETTER AND STRONGER THAN MOST OF THEM...c"",)"
4,good pad,easy to bring aroundjust be careful not to put this on dirty surface.feels just like a normal drum practice padvery silent still bounce the sticks well
2,A comic book without pictures,"The story seems interesting, and it is. But it's not written well. The Lawheads were trying too hard to make Hunter into a hard-nosed agent and were explaining too much. Like when someone mentioned a terrorist organization they belonged too, they made it a point that Hunter filed that away in his mind so he'd remember it. Well, no duh he would! Also, there is really only one plot line - the one described above. There are no subplots at all! So, basically, it's like a comic book, but with no pictures.And the names were sometimes groaners - instead of John the Baptist, it's ""Washer John""; ""Pilate"" is the last name of the governor of New York; instead of Mary Magdalene it's ""Maggie""; and Nicodemus is shortened to Nick. You get the idea .I think the graphic novel is a better choice than the novel trilogy."
1,Alternate Whoosi-whatsis?,"I read a few reviews that describe this little piece of propaganda as ""alternate history."" That is a sad, sad misnomer. This book is not alternate history, it is made up history. There is never any good explanation as to why ""the ancient system of kings"" survived into the modern day, or how come a giant jewish temple is smack in the middle of New York, or hey here's an easy one, WHO IN THE NAME OF GOD (no pun intended) FOUNDED ICON?This whole book is like a xtian though exercise in how to yank Jeebus into the 21st century. Of course it fails miserably, I was first introduced to this holy acid trip when my lady's mother decided ""hey Josh is a comic book fan, and an agnostic, this book will make him LOOOOOVE JASUS!""Wrong this book its graphic novels and all other writing by this moron belong on a bonfire, preferably soon and with himself and his co-writer as fuel."
1,No stars at all for this tripe,"This is one of the most poorly written books I've ever tried to read. The writing is pedantic at best. Frankly, I couldn't finish this piece of crap. The cover blurbs made it sound interesting, so I decided to try it. Wrong move on my part. There are too many well-written books around to waste your time with this thing.I didn't know it was supposed to be a ""christian"" book until I read the reviews here. I couldn't force myself to read enough of it to find any christian propaganda. I can't believe any reviewer here can honestly think this is good writing. If you do, you really need to read some decent literature for a change, not just stuff mass-marketed to sheeple. WWJB - what would jesus buy. So sad."
4,What is Publisher's Weekly talking about?,"Okay, there is NO profanity in the book. Did Publisher's Weekly actually READ the book? It is an engaging tale that brings the historical Jesus Christ into a tangible context. The story is gritty and raw--just like the biblical account."
3,almost perfect,nice fragance... it is a shame the product didnt have the inner mechanisim to extract the perfum... so i had to repackage the product into another bottle
3,BUYER BEWARE,"I RECEIVED THIS ITEM SOONER THAN EXPECTED SO THAT WAS NICE. BUT WHEN I OPENED THE BOX, YOU COULD ALREADY TELL THAT SOMEONE HAD OPENED IT, USED IT ONCE OR TWICE THEN DECIDED TO TRY AND RESELL IT. THE REASON I KNOW THIS IS BECAUSE THE AFTER SHAVE BOX WAS SCUFFED ON THE CORNERS AND THE AFTER SHAVE BOTTLE WAS NOT COMPLETELY FULL. SO EVEN THOUGH I GOT A GREAT PRICE ON THIS AFTERSHAVE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT CONDITION IT WILL BE IN UNTIL YOU GET IT."
2,"Good plot and ideas, awkward execution","I give the author points for some good (moralistic) ideas.As another reviewer noted, once the action moves in the fantastic world the writing becomes awkward and forced. Characters are so one-dimensional that I could not see much difference between the woodsman and the horseman-knight.Contemporary readers may enjoy this book, but I doubt it will be remembered in years to come.Check ""The Eyes of the Dragon"" by Stephen King instead. It may look similar but is a higher quality book of a different class altogether."
4,The Book of Lost Things,My book club read this book together. Everyone was surprisingly delighted with it. The references to the Grimm fairytales were humorous and the book kept my interest through to the end. I would recommend this book to anyone who liked fairytales as a child.
5,Marvelous!,"This is a richly textured, evocative trip into fairy tale land - for grownups only. The imagery is haunting, the story compelling, and the characters complex. It's NOT a read for children, or for the simple. The moral dilemmas are challenging, and their resolutions are satisfyingly complex and realistic. What a joy!"
5,"Dark and Sophisticated, Yet Optimistic","I absolutely loved this novel. Connolly's voice is unique, his prose crisp, and his imagery vivid. Moreover, he tells exactly the kind of tale we need: one that confronts the imperfection of our natures without becoming mired in the kind of cynicism so pervasive in today's ""fine"" literature. Well worth the read."
3,just okay,"There were some glaring weak points and holes in the story that proofreading should have caught. For example, the Woodsman didn't earn any respect from me for his proclaimed ""intelligence"" when, in a misguided attempt to be David's hero, he send David across the rope bridge ahead of himself, while he fought and succumbed to the wolves. Obviously, his part of the story was done, but, come on, really. They both could have run across the bridge and cut the ropes on the other side, thereby blocking the wolf pack. It was readable, though. The ending was pretty good."
1,"Dreary, derivative, choppy","It's C.S. Lewis without the skill, the imagination, or the mythological chops. A ragbag of every tale and trope you could imagine. Wolf creatures called ""loups"" (French for wolf). A king named Leroi (which means the king). It reads like middle-school fan fic."
1,This book is horrible!!!,"I love books with a little ""darkness"" and mystery, and I'm even drawn to gothic novels. This book started out great, but it just got too sick for me to handle. I have never thrown away a book...until now. When he started talking about little children being tortured and slaughtered I drew the line....someone had to! Not to mention the whole ""women laying with wolves"" thing! Sick! It is sad that he had to go too far, because it really had potential to be a great fantasy story! I would suggest NEVER reading this book or wasting money on it at all."
1,"Thought it would get better, but it didn't","The synopsis sounded interesting so I thought I'd give it a try. Immediately there was something about the book that put me off. I don't know if it was the writing style or what. It seemed too simplistic, almost dumbed down. I felt like I was reading a book written by a high schooler. But I'll read anything, so I gave it a chance. The story was somewhat decent but the execution was just too horrible to make it an enjoyable read. I didn't feel connected to the story or characters. Whenever a character died, I felt nothing. And beware: the author is preachy and homophobic. All I can say, I guess, is that if you still want to read it don't waste your money, get it from the library."
4,My first John Connolly novel.,This novel was recommended to me and I had never read any of John Connolly's books. I found it to be very intriguing look at fairy tales and their more grim side. This is definitely not the Disney version of the fairy tales. It was fun to think through all the characters in the book and how I've seen them portrayed before. It was difficult to put down and kept me interested throughout the entire book.
2,Only thing that saved it was the ending,"This was one of my friend's favorite books, loaned to me to read. So I had to finish it...otherwise I never would have. I normally have a hard time putting books down, but instead I had to push myself along. Very slow beginning, no great characters, not a particularly vivid world. Picks up a bit towards the end, but nothing grand. It wasn't until the last few pages of the book, that I was thoroughly impressed, and thought, ah...so that was the whole point of the book. A truly great ending, but wish it was more enjoyable getting there."
3,Book of Lost Things,This was an interesting book and a unique approach to the transition from childhood to adult.
3,Okay but not so dark,"I got ""The Book of Lost Things"" after I read the reviews. I was looking for something a little dark and a little scary...something I could get lost in. Unfortunately this wasn't it. I thought it was fun...I liked the Snow White and the Dwarfs bit..the Sleeping Beauty..the fairy tales retold. But in the end it was predictable. I had to force myself to finish it. A better coming of age adventure is Stephen King and Peter Straub's the Talisman. Now that is a great book."
1,I hated this book.,"This book is horrible. It started out okay, then kept getting worse and worse and worse, and then I kept reading to see if it would get better, and it didn't. Worst book I've ever read. An employee at Border's recommended it to me because I liked The Thirteenth Tale. I still can't look at that man the same when I go in Border's. What was he thinking?"
4,Quick Review,"I'm 28 years old, and I really enjoyed this story. It's a fairy tale loaded with action and gore. It's a nice change from the books I'm use to reading. I will definitely look for another book like this by John Connolly."
3,Revisiting Childhood Tales ... again ...,"Hasn't this been done before, this retelling of childhood tales from a darker, more adult perspective? I've seen this idea explored everywhere from Sondheim to anime. And boys wandering into alternate universes has been a standard plot since the Mabinogi, a thousand-plus years ago.I didn't find the plot original, and so the book for me came down to: how well did the author tell the tale? And I give him mixed results here. The book starts off well, but before the half-way mark settles into a dull ""get from A to B to C"" adventure. Part of the difficulty is that we know the ending by the second chapter, so all we have left is the journey itself.For all that, there are long stretches where the book is a great read. The second half is fun and engaging, albeit dark. I could almost give the book four stars except for a showdown that is rather anti-climactic and for a terribly cliche-filled final chapter"
5,"Wonderful, wonderful book","Remember the chills you used to get as a child when your mom or dad shared a classic fairy tale or campfire story? Not the P.C., sanitized versions that appear in modern editions, but the real deal where the wolf eats Grandma. John Connolly does a fabulous job of taking old familiars and standing them on their head, spinning something new out of old cloth, yet miraculously weaving it into a narrative that is compelling in its own right. Here you will encounter shades of Tolkien, C.S. Lewis and The Wizard of Oz, yet something fresh and exhilarating. More importantly, he makes you feel the pain of youth and how we all feel the tough pull of adulthood. Unlike most fantasties, this is one that is well grounded in reality. The ending is at once bittersweet and satisfying and left even this jaded reader with a tear in my eye. This is one I will share with my children when they get older. But don't confuse this as a book for children. Label this one ""Scary"" Potter."
2,Fun yet disappointing,"Connolly's book is fine if you consider it merely as a precursor to what would probably make a very watchable movie. However, when I picked it up, I was expecting more--good writing. His prose was often stiff, very predictable and trite. I almost laughed aloud when I read sentences along the lines of: 'And that was when David truly transitioned from boyhood to manhood.' HELLO?! What happened to the old-fashioned show, don't tell rule of writing?Overall, the book is just interesting enough to keep you reading, if only because not many people write books in this sub-sub genre I guess you could call Adult Revisionist Fairy Tale Stories. But overall I found the tone to be inconsistently presented, fluctuating between childish and incredibly sharp, found the plot to be a poor reworking of fairy tales that many have done better than Connolly, and found the whole book to be rather disappointing. Unmotivating character development.I'd wait for the movie."
2,Too dark for my taste,I hadn't gathered from the reviews that this was going to be dark and slightly twisted. Not what I was in the market for at all. And though I won't spoil it there was an obvious element to the ending that was missing which left me confused. Anyone else who has read it probably knows what I'm talking about but the main point is that the story left me with a heavy feeling that took a couple weeks to shake.
2,Pan's Labyrinth Meets Shrek,"I generally liked this book, but after reading the loads of ""supplementary"" material someone decided to shove in at the end, I have to say that I lost a great deal of respect for the author and his story. It was a bit like a magician who shows you all his tricks at the end; the magic dries up quick. But even before reading all the bad bits I think I liked Angela Carter better."
1,Intense dislike does not describe it,"Hated this book. Hated the way it was written, hated the characters, the predictability and the darkness of it.Twilight meets Mother Goose is about right. And I hardly ever hate any book."
1,Absolute trash,"I bought this book because it was recommended summer high school reading. If you like a combination of old fairy tales, comic book hero shenanigan- type activities, and gore this might appeal to you. I can't believe some high school English teachers thought this was a good read. I wish I hadn't spent the money. It's awful."
5,The Book of Lost Things,"I was delighted to come across The Book of Lost Things while browsing through the local bookstore. It is a character driven novel that revolves around a sad young boy and his magical and often terrifying quest for the Book of Lost Things. The Book of Lost Things outwardly appears to be a novel directed towards youngsters but it becomes clear early on that it is in fact a book that will appeal primarily to adults. Though the novel is based on fantasy, adults will sympathize with the struggles and hardships that the characters in the novel endure. I will definately be on the lookout for this wonderfully creative author!"
2,A fairytale from the dark side,"An interesting concept of a boy who is confused and sad after his mothers death. When his father remarries and produces a new sibling for him he becomes overcome with jealousy and resentment which leads him to a hidden world of gruesome fairytales.I thought the beginning chapters were really good, a very realistic insight into a child's mind. However once we leave reality the book failed to grab me and it took me longer than normal to read purely because I wasn't compelled to keep picking it up. I didn't particularly like the book but did like the concept of David having to use his wits and his memory of childhood tales to overcome some pretty gruesome dangers and adult themes. And, like all traditional stories...it has a moral.If you like your fantasy tinged with horror then you should enjoy this."
4,of Fairy Tales and Fables,"This was my first book from Connolly. I was intrigued by the title and then a brief read of the plot made the sale. Connolly does a great job reaching back to stories from the past (think the brothers Grimm) and tying them together in a fresh, and slightly twisted, way that adults will enjoy. You will find yourself remembering stories you grew up reading and sometimes watching (disney films). The way he takes these stories and turns them more 'personal' for our lead character gives the feel that any of us could have had a similar journey.If you are looking for a laid back read that keeps things moving with adventure and a bit of humor, this is worth a look."
5,Perfection,"This book was my introduction to John Connolly. I loved it! A fairy tale for adults full of scary things and dark beings, mysterious characters, heros, and fantasy. Was there a happy ending? Did they live happily ever after? Buy the book, enjoy, and find out for yourself."
5,Terrifyingly captivating!,"Just as the title projects, this book was terrifyingly captivating! For many of us, childhood tales such as Little Red Riding Hood are classic and endearing. But that doesn't mean a twist can't be fun!Connolly really stuck it to us with his imaginative tale of youth-cum-adult! And I would say that little David was much more intrigued than he would have been if his parents had told him this stuff!"
5,Wonderful,"I loved this book. A room with a window seat in which to read books in has always been a dream of mine, I have always loved books and fairy tales and fantasy and this book has it all. If you were to take the Wizard of Oz, mix in Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, Sleeping Beauty and Rumpelstiltskin and then even (I thought of at least) the Crooked Man from the old children's poem and some pretty gorey descriptions and pure evilness you would about have it. I could so see a movie along the lines of Pan's Labyrinth being made out of it.Most excellent and the best fairy tale I've read in a long, long time."
3,Enjoyable,Good book . A fairy tale for adults. Much like brothers Grimm in tone and violence. A pleasant diversion that I enjoyed.
4,I really enjoyed this fairytale!,It's been a while since I've sat down and read a book. My daughter gave me this book to read and I couldn't put it down.
5,Well worth the time.,I was mesmerized by the rhythm of Mr. Connolly's prose instantaneously. The book is well constructed and masterfully done. Highly recommended.
2,Snow White?,"Despite the many glowing reviews, this book simply lost me about half way through with the meeting of Snow White and the dwarves, and seemed to be meandering without a clear purpose, plot or even remotely rational explanation for what had happend to the young protagonist. Perhaps that came down the line in this book but by the time I got to Snow White, I ceased caring. There are too many good books in the world to waste one's time."
2,Eh..,"I was really interested by the story from the book descripton on the back, but now thay I have read it... it draged on quite a bit and it was too fantasy-ish. Almost like a wanna be Alice In Wonderland, but not good. I expected more from Connolly."
5,Hat Just Right,This is the exact hat that the minor league team sells on it's website and the price was cheaper. Great service - received hat in no time!
3,Dirk Pitt meets Hogan's Heroes,"If you are a fan of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, and you enjoy fact-based fiction WW2-style, then this is for you. It was kind of a fun read with our hero being all-knowing and completely indestructible by the fumbling Nazi party (including members of the Wermacht, SS, Gestapo, Berlin Police, and the militia). The characters were more than a bit thin, which actually worked well enough in this story because there was very little to invest yourself in. More action and adventure than real plot.I must say that I did enjoy the read, much as I enjoy movies like ""Indianan Jones and the Temple of Doom"", but it is not a first-rate thriller nor is it first-class literature.If you like the genre and would like a more compelling read, try Spandau Phoenix or Black Cross by Greg Iles."
2,Thayer should not ruin himself like Jack Higgins,"Please compare this book to Thayer's THE PURSUIT, then you would find out that this new book was just a reverse of The Pursuit, only 1)the hero was changed from a German prinsor/assasin to a GI prisoner/assasin; 2)the background was changed from 40s' America to 40s Germany; 3)American widow was changed to a German window. WHAT'S GOING ON, Mr.Thayer? Your should not have drained your Muse so fast like Jack Higgins or Jeffrey Archer by using their central kitchen mass production menu to produce new books only by shuffling those characters with different names and nationality! Don't do this please"
1,The most politically correct novel of WWII,"If there was a prize for the most politically correct novel of WWII, this book would win it hands down. Through out the book the main character wipes out all the bad guys (SS and Gestapo) while leaving the good guys (wehrmacht personnel, honest German policemen and German civilians) without a scratch. The farce reaches it's height when he gives a signed certificate to a German soldier attesting that he had been made to act under duress. Stick to Jack Higgins or AListair MacLean if you want fast paced WWII action"
2,this book is a joke,"I don't understand this book at all. The auther is really nice and stuff, but she doens't help me have multiple organs. I only have one. I don't know why I bought this book. Musicians like me need better books than this to help them learn about the organ. I'm not sure why she wrote this. I hope she doesn't write any more books."
1,Disappointing,"Seemed like a great idea, combine it all in one. I needed a small portable trackball mouse with 3 buttons, the optical would have been a bonus, especially in the track ball.Sorry, if you need to use the middle mouse button (the ball doubles as middle button) a lot, especially by holding it down, then forget this mouse. In addition if you're using it in trackball mode the scroll functions are tranfered to the optics in the bottom and the slightest movement will shift your cursor off target. This problem is compounded by the stiff button action which means you have to grip the mouse firmly while pressing the buttons.Also the tiny trackball doesn't have much range, something that might have been solved by the drivers but I really needed something that could be moved to different computers without installing drivers all the time.End result, an essentially unusable mouse. I'm very disappointed."
4,Go Go fire truck,Looks like ti will be fun for the kids. Sturdy and rubberized top so it will be soft if they fall on it.Cute toy with siren sound. Doesnt wail too loud or long so it looks as if I will keep the batterys in it.
4,fun and easy toy for small kids,"I thought that the shipping speed was pretty slow, but the truck has a nice easy remote control (two buttons) that make it simple for a 3.5 year-old recipient to master."
1,Lame toy,"This has been a big disappointment. Only 1 wheel turns and it goes so slowly. We've had other RC cars that my toddler loved, but this one he never plays with."
2,great first RC car!,"I think this would be a great toy if I could get the 9V battery in. The 3- AAs were fine. The siren works. I've mutilated 2 9V batteries so far and tried a rubber mallet to get the thing in with no luck. I guess you can say it's well made, but the battery compartment is a shade too small lengthwise-it's bent the ""-"" side of 2 batteries. The metal was making contact, but the truck isn't moving. I guess I won't call it a total failure until I can figure out a way to get this battery in the controller in. I'm calling Kid Galaxy today, so I guess I can comment on customer service later. I got this from an Amazon 3rd party, so I'm thinking they won't be any help- given past experiences with some of them.Edit: Battery was old! The new one fit right in and we've had a great time with this toy!Watch out to make sure you don't buy it for more than $25-30!"
1,Dismay!,"I have purchased many items on Amazon. Unfortunately this item was out sourced. I received the item promptly and then wrapped it for my grandson's birthday. When he opened it we immediately realized that it was dirty and the screws were stripped. In the excitement of a four year old, there isn't any packaging available. I have my receipt but to no avail as the vendor and Amazon have not replied to my request for a refund!"
4,The price is right.,"These aren't top-notch surgical tools, but they are great for having on hand for delicate procedures where a knife is too much. They're great for hobbies, but they are also sterile so you can use them for first-aid without concern.Overall, a great deal for the price."
4,YES....,I love having scalpels on hand....I am a nurse....good with a knife. Cheaper at American Scienfic Surplus and you don't have to order so many.
2,Not much new here,"First you need to understand this dose not include a book. It's a small (4 x 6 in) booklet with only 24 pages. Secondly, the content is very simplistic and gets very little into strategy. The contents, most the rules and directions of play, can be found in many places on the net."
1,Bad Design,"Great looking memory stick, but the cap kept falling off on the first day. No tension at all. I sent it back for a different a Corsair stick."
5,Dog Tales,"This is a perfect book for anyone who loves dogs. The photographs are excellent as are the stories. For a person like me who only reads music and software design, this is proof that the book is great."
3,Alright movie,"When I saw the previews to this movie, I thought ""wow"" my son would love it so I ordered it for him for x-mas. That wasn't the case. It was kinda boring, it seemed like there was more ballet moves than hip hop. Other than the movie itself, the shipping was fast and I did receive it on time, nothing against Amazon.com. I should have read the reviews on this movie before I ordered it."
3,Miami without the crme!,"I enjoyed this movie, but it was quite predictable. I love Miami and enjoyed seeing places I'd been to. My son liked it for the music and the dancing. There are many curvy, beautiful girls (just like the real Miami) and some hypersexualized dancing scenes. But there isn't any sex. If the kids are young and you don't want to expose them to a lot of skin and ""booty gyrations"" then don't watch it, but if you aren't bothered by that, it's a cute little show. Not gonna win any Oscars."
3,Needed More,It wasn't as entertaining as Step 1 and Step 2.I thought it was a little boring it probably didn't hold my interest.
4,Dancing is good,I like the whole mob thing I think it would be awesome to be apart of seeing something like that
2,Entertaining Terrible Film,"The film has no plot or anything, but if you go in with low expectations, it's at least entertaining to watch. Dancing is neat."
3,Great dancing. Thumbs down to the story line,Not as good as the first 2. I think the writers need to stick to the Baltimore School of Arts story lines.
3,it's not the same thing,"i really love the step up movies however, when i bought this one, i liked the fact i got a free download for it for i tunes although i had already bought the movie from i tunes. the others did not. which would've been nice. my biggest complaint is the others ones i bought came in a nice case with a movie cover that is a part of the case as to where this one has a plastic cover that slides off and when you take it off its just a clear plastic case with nothing- not even a scene selection that is usually on the inside. it just looks like a bootleg without the cover, there just nothing to it. in the picture it looks like the other ones i bought, but its not. i love amazon, i use it ritually, but i should have bought this one in person."
2,Too Risque,"What's to say? Too much booty shakin, etc. for my family's taste. Felt the story line could have been stronger."
3,Step Up! Step Up: Revolution,"Movie had a slow and predictable story line. Dance routines were great, but I could've just watched youtube clips of each dance scene and be satisfied. I found the movie in whole to be boring and not as good as the hype would have led it to be. The music and choreography were AWESOME though."
4,Entertaining for the entire family,"There was more of a story line than I expected, so I rated it 4 stars instead of 3. My husband and grandson were equally entertained by the music, dance, and cool cars."
5,iye,"muy buen 3d la peli y el cover genail, recomendando para todos los fanaticos! no lo duden un minuto !"
4,So much awesome dancing!,I really like this movie! It had lots of great dancing but I don't really like the lead female character all that much. I'm not sure if it's just me who didn't like her acting but she is a phenomenal dancer.
3,like the others,I love watching the dancing. But the story and the acting Isn't the best. I like the sound track also. :)
2,I did not enjoy it at all.,I did not enjoy the story line or the dancing in this version. I did enjoy Step Up 3 much better.
4,Great Movie,Loved this movie from start to finish. Did not like some of the language but other then that it was great.
4,Nice,I chose this rating as the flick is nice and the 3D bluray is also excellent. The digital copy works nicely
1,This movie sucks!,"This movie sucks! It was poorly written and made to attract idiot by getting quote on quote ""hot"" people who could not act if there life depended on it. There is no art to this movie unlike the first and second ones. This was a waste of time and money. And what the jack is up with the cover photo. And there was too many celebrities and bad music. The first and second movie was about art, dancing, love and life this movie is about making profit from mindless drones."
3,Lot of money to see pixelated movie,Get with netflix before they go under and have them teach you how to stream a movie over the internet.
5,Delivers what you would expect,"Same old story but very artistic and well done! If you like art, dance and beautiful people you should watch this."
4,Awesome Movie!!!!,The music and dancing keep you moving in your seats and it is a greatStory about love and personal battles we all face within ourselves.
3,OK Movie,"Did not think that the dancing was as good in this one. Story was OK, just could of had better dance scenes."
4,step up Revolution was awesome,This movie was way better than I ever imagined. Enjoyed by my wife also.. very upbeat and inspirational. Would definitely recommend to friends.
5,"Fun, talented dance film","If you take this movie story line for what it is, I can safely say I enjoyed this movie more than any I've seen recently. Others say it's wierd that the ""Mob"" starts dancing in odd times and places, but isn't that what this movie is about? I didn't see anything wrong with the acting; the story was fine. I just absolutely loved the dancing scenes. It was fun that the movie started with the 'kids' doing a performance art dance in the middle of the street. And I loved the costumes they wore when they danced in the office scene."
1,nothing like the first,I only got through the first 20 minutes and turned it off. There were way too many theatrics and totally unbelievable
2,Great Dancing - But That's All,"My 12 year old daughter desperately wanted to watch this for the dancing. I was concerned about potential adult content but the director demonstrated restraint. Good thing because if not for the incredible dancing, cool costume and visuals, this movie is void of any meaningful content. We would have enjoyed it even more if it were an hour of pure dance."
3,"Ok movie, dancing looked computer generated...","I enjoyed the movie, the storyline was interesting (but no real surprises) and the dancing was great to watch, but at times it looked totally computer generated, which was disappointing. I think most people are going to watch this movie to see the great dancing, but to often than not it looked fake, so I give this movie only a 3."
5,LOVE IT !,GR8 DANCING! WOULD OF ENJOYED JUST LIL MORE MOOSE BUT NOT COMPLAINING!I WILL BE LOOKING TO BUY THIS MOVIE FOR CHRISTMAS PREASNT.
3,"Its an ok movie if you like dancing, one of the better story lines then the others.","Its ok. Movie is one of the better step up movies, but I think they should definitely retire the movies and not make any more sequels"
3,dancing was great,I enjoyed the dancing but it was a bit tedious. still really glad I saw it. I'm glad I did a rental.
3,Good,The movie was really good. A lot of dancing which is nice to see. Quality of the movie not to much.
5,pretty good,was better than I thought it would be. liked the dance scenes better; acting could have improve but since I'm not an actress I will give the stars on the movie a thumbs up.
2,Heh...,"Worst step up movie, second only to the first one. Boring. If you like romance and dancing though, it's not that horrible a movie, it could honestly be a lot worst."
2,BORING,So boring - just the same old story line and it took way to long to get to the good parts; the dancing - amazing but just not enough of it to keep your attention.
3,Like the movie,"I like this movie a lot, but my issue was this Blu-ray + 3D Blu-Ray+ Digital Copy. I have a blu-ray player and in this middle of this movie the sound and picture would go to crap. It really irritated me. I returned this product once and got a new one hoping that was the issue, but it wasn't. Very displeased with that."
3,Dancing was really cool!,The dancing in this movie was awesome! But some of the plot and scenes were so cheesy it got a little stupid. But overall it was a pretty good movie because of the dancing and creativity with how they danced.
3,"A typical dance movie, but entertaining!",A Similar plot in a different setting. Dance routines were cool but nothing memorable. A popcorn movie none the less.
5,They revolutionized dancing...,"I've seen all the step up movies. Love them all. This might be in my top 2. I can't be too sure until I watch them all again and these days who has time. All I know is that the story is generic, but the actors/actresses are well liked. The acting is some of the best in the franchise. Of course that curly haired kid is in this movie again, at the very end. We all love him. I'd recommend this version. The cinematography is great."
2,"Movie was pretty good, quality of it sucked","The movie and dancing was good, I have all 4 of the Step Up series and I'd say this has to be one of my fav's. I for some reason thought that by purchasing the movie it gave me the option to stream or download. The quality of the streaming was terrible. It was very grainy. I have a HD LED 55' flat screen and I streamed it off of my laptop to the TV. I've done this many times with other streaming or even movies from the laptop dvd and not had issues with the quality previously but it was really bad. Next time I will take the time to order the physical DVD/BluRay as this didn't save me any $."
3,Bathtub drain cover.,Here is another item that is way over priced for the quality. I was able to cut the screw off and make it work.
2,Just because it's Sizzla...,"Sorry, you guys must not have much do to with your time than to right those overly boring right-ups. At the end of the day, the cd went in for a quick run through, then got put away. I don't care about all the cross-over ideas, the album should have been better. Period. I pulled one track off the album, and I don't believe I have to tell you which one that is. True heads will know.Khader"
5,Excellent Macro Lens,"For only half the price of Nikon 105mm, this lens is an amazingbargain!It is super-sharp, renders great colors, autofocus is very smooth andprecise. I am very impressed with the manufacturing, too.Highly recommended."
5,Great set!,Love it! Love it!This set contains 6 of my favorite Elvis movies. The box is made of blue suede and very nice quality. Such a great deal for Elvis fans. :)
2,"Too Much ""Money"" business","2003 plays like 2nd generation video, Elvis is fuzzy, not clear.""Too many re-recordings"", older originals a better buy.I'm gonna try for an OLD vhs 1st release. The audio is now STEREO-Hi-FI. Stereo was started with THE Beatles ""Rubber Soul"", and ""After-Math"", by The Rolling Stones. In the 1956 time era for original Elvis Presley, there was mono. Anything re-created in 'Stereo' is not original Elvis.Me; I got the stamped ""10-10-57"" Jailhouse Rock 45 - $.057c! in 1957. Music questions: apa_musica@yahoo.com 51 years experience!"
4,G.I. Blues,"In his first musical comedy, Elvis Presley stars as lady-killer Tulsa Maclean, an Army Sergeant stationed in West Germany. Tulsa and his buddies hope to make enogh money to open a small nightclub upon their return...G.I. Blues marks the debut of the new Elvis Presley. Fresh out of the army, gone were the sideburns the press had found so offensive, and gone was the flashy, hip attire. The look was more convervative.The changes in terms of image and film genre do not mean that G.I. Blues was an inferior film, which many Presley biographers have implied. It remains a well-crafted musical comedy with a number of solid songs and a strong female co-star. The only negative result is that Elvis would be discouraged from making other types of movies. This film is considered the prototype for future Presley films, which, unfortunately, declined in quality as the decade progressed.Produced for Paramount Pictures by Hal B. Wallis. Released November 23, 1960. Color."
3,G.I. King,"I enjoyed this film. Sure Elvis sings a number of songs, some good, some just plan silly. He plays the same good-hearted character after the girl. His buddies help him along the way. He gets the girl. If you love Elvis it's worth the rent, if you only want to watch a story with fewer songs I would recommend Change of Habit."
2,"If you read the book, don't bother with the movie","I read Needful Things by Stephen King and when I was finished, I wanted to run right out and see the movie. I thought it would be as terrifying as the book. I was wrong. I do not think this would have been a bad movie had I not read the book, but since I did, I was very disappointed. A number of story lines and characters were left out. While the main plot was the same, none of the other details were. Skip the movie and read the book on this one."
2,Not The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Eventhough others have liked this movie, I have found it to be quite boring. The acting was okay, but the film itself was just displeasing to me.I thought it at least deserved two stars, because the movie kept me wondering what was going to happen next. It was a good thing I got this video at the library for free, other than paying $2.29 at my local video store.Max Von Sydow's role as Lucifer was weird. That's another reason I gave this movie two stars. I never thought that a man more powerful than the President would have listened to the people and leave their town. You would've at least figured he'd turn out to be some horrifying creature. But I guess when Stephen King wrote the book he wanted to add some realism to it.If you're going to rent this movie, it should be on a two-for-one night. Just so you know you haven't wasted your money."
3,A Decent Movie,"The movie's humor made up for its lack of suspense. The plot was predictable, almost soap opera-ish. Definitely not a horror movie. If you're looking for the suspense in this story, read the book."
3,Just like the other reviews,"The movie wasn't bad, the acting was actually very good. Sydow does a pretty good emulation of Gaunt; you really like him at the beginning as in the book. It would have been impossible to recreate the book, there are WAY too many characters. In the movie, they don't include any of the school staff, some of the purchasers, or the con man from the past. If I had a complaint about the movie, it was ignoring the past lives of the Sheriff and Polly Chalmers. IMHO, those were two very crucial subplots to the story. Faithful to the book? Impossible without becoming a miniseries (The Shining testified to that). Acting and setting were well executed, however."
3,Good movie. Not so good DVD,"I like this movie a lot. It is classic Stephen King and good performance from the stars (Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia, Max Von Sydow,Amanda Plummer, and the late JT Walsh). The story about satan (Max Von Sydow) who opens a store in a small town (CAstle rock) and started to create war among the town people. Too bad this movie has not been given good treatment on DVD. The picture is a little bit dark and not in widescreen. The sound is also a bit soft and no 5.1 audio. I wish a long version will appear on DVD soon. But if you can find a copy of this DVD, grab it. I like the movie enough to buy despite the shortcomings of the technical quality."
1,Needful Things.... edited,I was really disapointed with this edited version of Needful Things. At least give me all the movie content and let me skip the parts I dont want to see.
4,fun beginning....cheesy ending,"One thing I've noticed about Stephen King is that he can have problems ending his stories. He's so good at building you up or drawing you in then it's like what's next, what's the point, what do I do with these people? This movie is not an exception. I found this story to be very fun not really scary. I don't know it may have been in 1993 but in 2004 it's funny. But I was very disappointed at the end. I'd say watch it it anyway especially if you're a Stephen King fan. It makes for a good night in anyway."
1,"Good book, the movie is a let down","The screenplay is a far cry from the original novel. First of all, many of the book's main characters are completely missing. Where's Ace Merrill? Replaced by a one minute extra character (the Treasure Island book guy.) The book is also much more suspensful and has a lot more dark humor buried in it. I didn't expect the film to be as elaborate as the book but this film just simply is a poor cinematic work all around in addition. Cheap. Incomplete. Bad effort. Read the book and watch something more worthwhile."
1,Second Best Steven King film brought to life.,"In my opinion, this is perhaps the second best adaptation of a Stephen King novel. The unfortunate tragdey of this DVD lies in the fact that it is Pan and scan format versus Widescreen. I returned me DVD when I discovered it was hacked up. Polygram, get a clue about this format."
2,"Great novel, fair film","This film confirms one glaring fact about King's novels: they just don't translate to film very well. The screenplay for ""Needful Things"" attempts to compress a long novel, resulting in a mostly unsatisfactory film for those viewers who have read the novel. The cast is rather good, and the actors do their best within the constraints of the script. OK for those who have never read the novel, but a confusing bore for those who have. Don't blame Mr. Gaunt - the real villains are the scriptwriters. Caveat emptor!"
1,it's not a dvd,That sucked. Good movie. I thought it was going to be a dvd. I was a little upset. Be sure to read the fine print.
1,Read the book.,"What a bad mess of crap. Skip this film and read the book or watch a Stephen King adaptation worth seeing like ""The Shining."""
3,The extended version is the one to hope for.,"There's at least a 3hr version of this film, most likely longer, it aired on television and cable, at 4rhs with commercials and with the R rated material edited.This version is okay, but it's cut down to the bare bones of the plot(s) for time and space. The longer version has never been seen on video, but we can hope!"
1,A Great Film wasted,"The original Needful Things was an hour longer than it appears on this DVD. Also, there is no widescreen version that is produced. This is probably the best adaptation of a Stephen King book ever brought to film, but it has not yet been deemed profitable enough to put any effort into the produciton of the DVD. The movie itself is superb (for its genre), 3 and 1/2 stars easy. However, this is one of the most shoddily made DVDs that I have ever seen. It is simply not worth buying."
3,way way too harsh!,"I just read Jeff Shannon's review of this film and quite frankly I don't understand why he is so harsh. It may not be the best Stephen King film but it's far from the worst. It's actually pretty good and quite underrated, esp. if you have seen the expanded TV version which is even better. Why hasn't that been released on dvd? It blows away this version, what fans of this film really need is a truly re-edited version, that combines the two versions into one film. In any case,if you like Stephen's work or you liked the book,pay no attention to the review and go ahead and rent or buy this film, you won't be sorry.Now, if you want to see a truly horrible film,why not try ""Independence Day"" or ""Transformers"" both are completely unwatchable garbage and both made tons of cash. You decide!"
2,Could've Been Better,"I admit I haven't read the book Needful Things, but this movie just seems like its missing something. It starts out well, with a look at small town life.The scene where Ed Harris, as the sheriff, and Max von Sydow as Leland Gaunt, the antique shop owner/Satan, meet and share some pie is almost sublime. But then the movie gets silly, with Ole Scratch turning the townspeople violently against each other by providing all the things they've ever wanted most. The acting is good, though Sydow really chews the scenery by the end. Overall, fair time killer."
4,Needful Things,Needful Things - Loosely based on the book of the same name by Stephen King. Not as detailed as the book. Some themes and characters not included in the film. Still a good yarn for those who like this genre.
4,Good Book Ok Film,"First let me say that I'm a big fan of the book, which is far better than the film. Not that the movie is bad though. It's accuatly quite good. I gave the movie four stars because of it's great cast, good music, and great direction, but if I had to recommend anything it would have to be the three hour cut that airs on TBS every now or then. It's a good movie but please read the book, It's much better."
3,dances quickly through its devilish plotting like a reveller,"A gleefully macabre movie that dances quickly through its devilish plotting like a reveller upon a tombstone. The Devil is once again given the wryly omnipotent treatment, this time by Max Von Sydow, and the Stephen King characterization does shine through in some of the homespun acting. The script does allow the viewer in on the naughty relishing of, say, winding up and letting fly with apples through a local's window, or hacking apart someone who harmed your dog. The Devil can make you do it."
5,Fresh and satisfying,"This is a beautiful Asian fragrance. It is clean and refreshing, nothing overpowering and heavy scented. This parfum wears extremely well. I have worn this parfum since its first release by Alfred Sung. Therefore, I warn you, this parfum is not for every woman, but only the woman with great imagination and desires."
5,Pay no attention to the Freepers,"In case you don't know, ""Freepers"" are fans of a certain far-out-right-wing-nut website and they go on sites likes this and ""freep"" it by giving books one-star reviews. They try to infiltrate other sites and shut them down. They're rotten to their cores.One Freeper halfwit from St. Paul, MN (his ""review"" is below) is posting the same review for every one of Soros' books. I love how they spend so much energy being pathetic little sheep.Anyway, buy this book, it's wonderful and very insightful. I've learned a lot."
2,"incredible trader, lousy economist","George Soros is the best example that you do not have to know anything about economics to make a lot of money. Of course markets never achieve equilibrium! That is the nature of markets. But implying that ""regulation"" from bureaucrats will solve this ""problem"" is a long shot. Market ""imperfections"" are not the problem. Government intervention is the problem. Seems to me that Soros would rather deal with government officials instead of dealing with the market forces. Sure is a lot easier to make money controling the former instead of trying to control the latter."
1,Hypocrisy from a convicted criminal,"As one reviewer mentioned, Soros was convicted of inside trading in France. He should be in jail writing his books.Don't waste your time with this book. He has no interest in ""open"" societies."
3,More of a coming of age book than werewolf.,This is the first book of a trilogy about a werewolf(beast) shape shifter that learns what it's like to be human through the body of a boy. This book focuses mostly on growing up and sexual urges and does great on that subject but it doesn't seem to let the wild beast out. It seems rather tame to me.I find it similar to another book called 'The Beast Within'. Both were published about a year apart. Now this book's character is more savage and less tame.
1,Not as good as the Koday Easyshare,"This product was not as good as the Kodak easyshare viewer. The battery life was very poor. The pictures were slow to come up on the screen. This product was returned and I bought the Kodak, which was 100 times better. It also came with a case."
4,"PhotoShare 2.4"" Digital Photo Album","The clarity of the pictures is not all that great, but the price is cheap compared to the others so I didn't expect super-sharp images. It's a great replacement for those plastic photo albums that get torn up in your purse so easily. I use it to show pictures of my kids/family. For the price, you can't beat it."
2,very low quality product,"I wish i had read more reviews on this instead of looking at the great sale they were having for it. I probably would have figured out why they were selling so cheap. the quality is very poor and slow. i had to turn it off and back on more than once while trying to load the pics for the grandparents xmas gift. someone else mentioned poor battery life, i would have been glad to get 10 minutes out of it. maybe it was the batteries, i'm going to try again with better quality batteries but the battery sign started flashing almost immediately. they weren't the best batteries but they were brand new. it also got very hot with the batteries in it. since xmas is 2 days away i don't have time to return them (i ordered 2) but will be keeping an eye out for something better to replace these with for the grandparents."
3,Digital photo album,"At first I was disappointed with this item as it would not easily set up with the pictures that I wanted to use. However, after figuring out how to properly enter the pictures as a thumbnail set, the album worked perfectly. My wife carries the album in her purse (with all the other stuff) and finds it easy to whip it out and show the entered pictures. We had considered the keychain units but liked the larger picture 2.4 inches of this album."
1,Not in English,This movie is not in English although the title of the movie is as is the book. There is no forewarning anywhere that the movie is not in English. Sounds like it might be Russian?
1,Peace Child DVD,This DVD appears to be in German. It is not in english. I do not speak German. This needs to be corrected. I want my $1.99 back.
3,cat in the hat,The Dr Seuss Hat is not real sturdy but does what it is meant to do. Made of cheap material.
3,doesn't stand up well,"I purchased this hat to use at a Dr Seuss themed baby shower I threw for a friend. It arrived very wrinkled from packaging and did not want to stand up well on its own. As a children's toy, they may find it fun - depends on if your child likes hats? But for my use I wasn't exceptionally impressed by the product."
2,Didn't live up to Reviews,"I had read all of the reviews and thought I would get a quality product. This hat was made of cheap felt like fabric, and will not stay upright. Not worth the price at all."
2,Overpriced,"I could not believe the price I paid for this hat. It is thin, generic looking and hard to keep on your head."
3,It's a Cat In The Hat... hat,"This item is a standard, cheaper quality Cat in the Hat... well, hat. It's thin material so it won't hold up with heavy use. But, we purchased for our daughter's graduation speech, and it worked perfectly. It's a novelty type of product and it looks nice. Just don't think it's made like a standard quality hat -- and enjoy!"
4,Cute Hat,"I purchased a few of these hats for my son's Dr. Seuss party. Everyone had fun trying the hats on and posing for pictures. These hats were very cute and durable, not flimsy at all."
4,"Great hat, a little unsturdy","It's a terrific hat made of a nice fabric that has been easy to keep clean. As long as I stuff the inside with tissue paper or newspaper, the hat stands up just fine."
3,Nice quality,"Used this for Halloween. Good quality material. Very pleased, used the bubble wrap in the packing inside the hat for additional support."
4,Worked great!,This hat fit my Husbands head nicely. It needed to be stuffed with paper or tissues to stand up correctly though.
1,"ok for a cheap compass, but....","the shipping was $4.75! I purchased this with a bunch of other items and didn't see a breakdown per item of what the shipping costs would be. This compass, as expected for a cheap compass, has to be tapped several times to get it to point the right direction. That's ok, I'm just bummed that I spent $7.70 on a compass that's only worth a couple of bucks."
5,The best $1.50 investment ever!,"Initially, I purchased this book for cheap thinking that it would be a book worth skimming through. I was wrong - I read the entire book cover-to-cover! I was (and still am) having trouble deciding whether graduate school was for me and if my chosen career was a mistake. After reading through many of the sections, I realized how my fears were holding me back and keeping me from following my dreams.I would recommend this book to people seeking guidance in their life, especially if they are deciding whether or not they have chosen the right path. If you are honestly evaluating your choices and change in career, this book will help you. It provides many aspects for which you can analyze your hesitations toward a certain avenue, whether or not your fears are rational or unfounded."
5,When you are ready to change your life...read this book.,"I was told by a friend that this would be a good book to complete my studies. I ordered it and then told a friend about it...I never got to read the whole thing before passing it on to my friend. She was ready to read it and follow the guidance...it changed her life. If you are sick and tired of feeling sick and tired, then this book will help you step out of the stagnation you are living in and move towards taking control of your own life. I believe that everyone, no matter how rich or poor, has dysfunction in their life, and this book is plain speaking enough to help understand how to change that. Happy Healing!!!"
5,Gridin,I love this book danielle did her thing as always. i have yet to be disappointed by any of her work. cant wait til the next one comes out.
2,Juvenile Writing and Not Creative,"Based on the glorious reviews, I purchased ""Grindin"" over a year ago and just now read it. I'm terribly disappointed in this book. It was mainly about hustling, grinding, and getting yours by any means necessary. The dialogue was corny and I was so tired of reading about the designer gear that each character was wearing. This is nothing but a corny, high siding, ghetto read! The story had no creativity, just ghetto events that anyone could write if they swung in the ghetto. If you are down for that then this book is for you! Also, at times towards the ending, it was confusing; I didn't know if it was the past, present, or future between Chaz and Kennedy's toxic relationship.Overall rating: 2.0"
2,beware of vinegar and hot suace recipe,"Good tips, but the recipe for vinegar and hot sauce did not help with catepillars eating my pumpkin leave, just killed the leaves."
5,A Perfect Gift,I have never enjoyed a gardening book like I have this one. Humor is mixed with fact and tips. I would suggest this to anyone no matter what level of a gardener they are. Very informative and refreshing.
3,"It's okay, but not great.","I was a little disappointed in this book. I was interested based on all of the positive reviews, and especially wanted a book with pesticide-free information. Some of the ideas in the book aren't practical, and some don't work. If you are looking for an answer to a specific question, there might be only one suggestion, and this was not helpful to me. It is enjoyable to read, but not as useful as I had hoped."
4,A must have pocket companion,This book has a LOT of great info. My only gripe is that I wish it was a tad bit more organized and that the info was a little more in-depth. Otherwise.... it's still a must have.
5,What a delightful little book!,"I have had this book by Sharon Lovejoy on my coffee table since it arrived weeks and weeks ago. It is full of very useful information, gardening tips, recipes for natural garden products and pest control, etc.Sharon's beautiful and colorful illustrations throughout make it a delight to read. I can see pulling it off the shelf when the snow is falling in January, just to think good gardening thoughts... and become inspired.This little book would make any gardener happy to receive it as a gift. It would be useful for the beginner as well as a Master Gardener. I highly recommend it."
1,Despicable book,"I am very disappointed that Amazon.com provides exposure for such books and sordid graphics as ""How to Kill Your Girlfriends Cat Again"".I have witnessed too much animal abuse to consider this inane book the least funny. Animal abuse and animal killings - are not a laughing matter. There are too many worthwhile books still not included on the Amazon site to devote space to this type of offering. This and the earlier book richly deserve being out of print. Why would anyone spend good money on this trash?"
5,We love this puzzle!,"My nearly three-year old, who is very curious about anatomy and asks endless questions about bones, muscles, blood, etc., got this puzzle recently as a gift. She enjoys taking it apart and putting it together endlessly, and this afternoon, she figured out that she can assemble the different layers separately, side by side, rather than simply stacking them in the puzzle (which is also lots of fun). It is a great learning tool and enjoyable toy. She also loves the two books called ""Me and My Amazing Body"" (Joan Sweeney) and ""The Skeleton Inside You"" (Phillip Balestrino) that we frequently use to ""compare"" different pictures of various parts of human anatomy. The puzzle is also age-appropriate for a 3-4 year old; not too hard to put together, but it takes a bit of practice and time at first. Love it!"
5,Fun and Educational,"I bought this for a friend's daughter when she was about 3 or 4. She loved it so much that her younger brother and she started fighting over who got to play with it, so I bought them the boy puzzle as well so they could do both. Even as she got older, she seemed to enjoy it. It's a great way of understanding a child's body, and it's pretty cool to watch them discover what the body looks like and why. I'll probably purchase one for my goddaughter for her upcoming birthday since she'll be 3 this year. I think it's a great tool and hopefully will help with that pesky body image stuff!"
1,"VERY sharp, dangerous pieces","We have this toy in a ""boy"" version. The main problem: it has a lot of small pieces (arms, legs) with VERY sharp corners. The manufacturer made no effort at all to round corners. I have never seen a puzzle with such sharp, dangerous elements. Some of them are like long thin wooden knives. I would not want to live an active child with this thing alone. Notice that the ""recommended age"" is 4. Perhaps a 4 y/o would have no problem with dangerous pieces, but s/he would also have no interest in such a simple toy. The realistic age of a kid's interest is 2.5 to 3.5 y/o. For that age, the toy is simply dangerous. Also, ""educational"" part is silly. A kid old enough to understand what it means to have muscles on top of organs will have no interest in playing this toy. The ""educational"" value of seeing a skeleton and then lungs is mostly lost on a 2.5 y/o."
4,Great Puzzel But It Is Flawed,"Just got this puzzle today for my very curious 3 year old daughter. She LOVES it. I do too, my only complaints are1. Nothing is labeled.2. The mouth has no detail, just weird pink and purple stripes. I don't know why they didn't just draw a tongue.3. It's not in order, in my non-professional opinion I would have much rather seen the organs at the bottom, then skeleton, muscles, exc..... So I would be able to better explain to her that her ribs are over her heart and lungs to protect them and her skull is there to protect her brain. But ehh...It is a good size. It's tall and slender the pieces are also a good size so if one is dropped it is findable.So in conclusion if you are looking for a puzzle that is educational themed this is a good buy, if you are looking for something actually educational I recommend getting one of those 3D model kits you see in doctors offices in my non-professional opinion."
4,Hold on to your PVC hot pants cause this book is Smokin!,"Many a time I have woken up in the morning, stepped into the closet and looked at a vast array of choices contained therein, but have never paused to consider the true source of those lovin' threads. Thanks to M. Moncrieff's wonderful book, I can now trace the origins of my nylon Run-DMC track suit back to the amazing chemists employed in America and Germany prior to the Second World War. This book is a must-have for anyone who refuses to shop chez Gap, Banana Republic, or J. Crew. And you know who you are, kiddies. After all, where better to know from whence we came than to get back to the source, so to speak, and fetch it? This book will take you there, believe me."
1,This perpetuates the myth that sharks are bad and should be killed.,"Even the author of the Jaws story realizes that the movie misled the public and now works for shark and marine life preservation and conservation.Bad move Legos. This should be taken off the shelves. Educate your children on the importance of sharks, not killing them."
1,BORRRRRRRRRRIIIIIIINNNNGGGGGGG!,"Do you like to watch other peoples home movies? The ones that all you can hear are the inane comments of the tourists seated behind camera and wind on the microphone? than this video is for you!If you, like me, are considering a visit to the island, and are looking for an informational / educational / documentary style DVD on Assateague because you are wondering how they got there and why they swim - this video is not for you!This video tells you virtually nothing. In addition to providing no information about Assateague or the ponies - they play horribly monotonous acoustic guitar music throughout.For $6.99, this is what I would expect.For $24.99?I want my money back!XXXX"
4,"suspensful, strange, and unique","I didn't know what to expect from this movie. It was overall very suspensful, with lots of twists and turns. I haven't seen anything like this movie. Nothing too typical or predictable. A few scenes do not connect well together, and the movie can drag on a bit. I don't know if i could sit through it again, but it was suspensful and captivating 2 hrs of entertainment from some talented actors (and a cute Adrian)"
2,"good start, then hits train","fine start to this movie: quirky, well-edited, hints of philosophy, mystery.then it falls off a cliff into pornographic theatres, lesbian kissing, sex, and monotonous scenes about a venial may-to-october relationship. wow, haven't been that dissapointed in a 2nd half in a long-time, it's almost two movies smashed together, thumbs down!"
1,Star Logic 8D,"This Mouse is the worst thing I have ever bought for my computer, and since I built my computer from the ground up, I should know. First, it would not install on windows XP, XP just WOULD NOT recognize the driver for it. I tryed contacting tech support and got back a question for my answer. After answering the question, I got no reply, even with repeated attempts. Secondly, the scroll ball began to stutter after only a few days, and within two weeks, quit altogether. Lack of Tech Support, and Lack of Function make it a POS for me."
5,AWESOME,"This is an awesome train set, and huge. Very durable and fun for the entire family. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a train set both young and old."

2,More of a compellation than compelling,I was looking for thoughtful dialouge on the areas of theology that evangelicals agree on. Instead the book provides excerpts from a variety of different evangelical documents. It is not a bad resource to have but for me it failed to provide the consensus mentioned in the books title.
5,Great fun!,"My son's favorite gift on Christmas day after he started playing with it. I will admit that he hasn't gotten it out since the holidays ended but I still think it will be a good one to keep. The manufacturer should change the packaging to make it look more modern and ""cool"". Just saying...I think it kept the kids from wanting to open it and play with it."
4,fun forkids,she loved it.. 7YO well played with a good bit on xmas day and she wanted it to play with the next day as well.
5,best toy we've purchased this year,"This set was a pleasant surprise! It lived up to all the hype I had read about Snap Circuits. It is something we will be adding onto for years. I was especially pleased that my 7 year old grandson was able to follow the diagrams and do this by himself, and then thrilled his five year old brother was successful as well. This is the best thing we have found since magnetiles!"
4,Disappointed kids turned into believers!,"When my twins opened the box, they said a pitiful ""thank you"" and set it aside. Within two hours, though, after the new wore off their other gifts, they began messing around with it. By the end of the day, they had gone through numerous batteries, and were arguing the benefits of different circuit arrangements. I highly recommend this."
4,Awesome,"This is really good.I liked it more than my 7 years old son.I am sure he will like it once he starts understandig concepts of electonic circiut.Manuals are easy to read and understand.One part was missing , I have not called their toll free number to get the missing part.Overall its a good toy for that cost"
5,It's a snap!,"This was purchased for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas. He couldn't wait to make something. He told his friends that he ""got the best gift and that you can make anything with it."" I'm looking forward to buying the next level of difficulty for him."
2,Snap Circuit review,This was very disappointing. We got through a few of the easy circuits and then the circuits did not work. Directions were followed very closely and checked to make sure they were right. We got bored very quickly.
5,excellent toy,"My daughter thought it was great fun at first, but needed a lot of help with it. She's 9. However, after leaving it alone for a week, she came back to it and builds circuits all on her own now."
5,Awesome product,My kids love this toy and so do I. There are so many configurations they never get tired of it. And it keeps them from sitting in front of TV or video games.
3,Fun for learning,"Fun for a short while, my daughter really wanted this badly but couldnt get it to work properly. Some of the simple circuits worked fine but others like the am radio would not work even though it was setup correctly"
3,Snap Circuits,"My 11 year old son thought this was cool, but he won't play with it without help. It hasn't gotten much use in our house over the past year. It is a nice toy and good quality. I recommend for the right child."
5,Great for the inquisitive mind,"not every kid would like this, but if you child has an inquisitive nature, they will LOVE it. There are many projects to keep them occupied. Its a great way to spend some time together."
5,Great hands-on science toy,"A great choice for my 8 yr. old grandson. He got into project mode immediately; directions were clear enough for him to work on his own with just a little assistance from Dad. He couldn't wait to try the next gadget, passing up the offer of dessert to keep on working. Best description would be Lego-like circuit building without all the tiny parts. Lots of positive feedback when designs work as expected, plus easy opportunities for troubleshooting to make corrections. SC-300 is just the right size to explore simple to more complex designs, so there's plenty of room for growth. Summary: Promotes many science as well as reading skills in an enjoyable and safe format."
5,Lots of fun for all ages!,"I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas. He had no problem creating several different projects with it and loves it. It is pretty basic and comes with a detailed instruction booklet. It is great for ages from about 8 years on up. The one thing that I would like to see is something to make it more educational, like a better description of the different electronic components on each part, instead of just color and number coding. I would definitely recommend this, it is a great value for the money and all of my kids love it."
4,Snap Circuits Review,I really cannot review this product yet because my granddaughter's birthday has not come up yet. But it looks like it would be fun even for me. This is why I gave it three stars. I don't know about the product yet.
1,Warning: birth defects and reproductive harm,"From the Amazon review this looks like a great toy, so I went to a local store to confirm that it would be suitable for our son. The box contains the following warning: ""WARNING: This product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the State of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm. Wash hands after handling."""
1,miss informed,"When purchasing this item the product description lead me to believe that it was made in the USA. But when I received it, the product was clearly marked made in China. I like to support my own Country and the economy, manufacturing if we don't try to support our fellow American working-class. Soon there will not be manufacturer in this country, or jobs!!!!!"
4,The kids love it! I don't like the price.,"good product for children. They love to make the different things, but too expensive. It does teach them something, but not enough for the price."
5,My 10YO son really enjoyed this set!,Santa brought this set for my inquisitive 10 YO and he spent hours with it on Christmas Day and has gone back to it a few more times since. He is just learning about electricity so just make sure you supervise the first few projects until they get the hang of it. Some pieces that look similar do different things that can overpower the circuit. Follow the steps in the enclosed booklet and everything will go smoothly :)
3,Snap Circuits,"It was a gift to my nephew. I have absolutely NEVER seen him use it, so I don't know what to think about it. I thought it was a very neat present myself."
4,circuit set,My children are 8 and 11 and they both loved this set. It was easy to put together without any help from an adult and they like the effects that happen when thet put it together correctly.
5,Fantastic Product,This is a great Product! The Grandkids are making all the circuits and are really enjoying themselves. I wish there was an easy way to order another breadboard so more than one (child or adult) could use this at a time.
5,Great introduction to basic electrical theory,"I bought this item for my daughter for christmas. She had just turned 9 fifteen days earlier. Out of everything she got for christmas, this was by far her favorite gift. There are over 300 activities. This kit teaches them on so many levels. Even assembling the example projects teaches them basic assembly sequencing in a specific order (following directions). I was impressed at some of the concepts introduced even within the first 75 projects. Concepts like AND, NOT, OR, NAND logic are introduced in a fun educational way. It is really fun to have her setup each project and make it work, then we discuss the important take-away lessons from the project."
5,Problem solving toy,We love this kit. I lent it to my daughter's 4th grade class for their science module. Super for families who like to learn and especially home schoolers.
5,Likes to tinker,"I bought this for my grandson's birthday. He is 10 years old and ADHD. When he would visit me, he always wanted to start tinkering with something, either a clock or an old radio. This gift is perfect for him, it is not in the least frustrating and the outcome is very rewarding for him. He will sit and work with the set for an hour at a time.I have recommended this set to many of my friends.A Happy Granny in Michigan"
5,A WINNER!,"I purchased the first Snap Circuit 100 for my oldest grandson many years ago. I bought one for my 4-year old granddaughter two years ago - she loved it because she could ""make something happen."" She could follow the picture layout and then turn on the switch. Two years later, her four-year old brother took over. This Christmas he is getting his own Snap Circuit 300 - without a doubt, the best toy for the money on the market. If you could purchase only one toy for a child 4-years-old or older, this would be it. It is sturdy, dependable, neatly organized in its box, educational, reasonably priced, and fun to play with (even for adults)."
4,grandson joy,"The message is loud and clear. My grandson LOVES his birthday present, a toy that is as fun as it is educational. Thanks for getting the present to him so promptly without a hitch. From me in Australia to him in Indiana--simple!"
5,grooming a future engineer,"This was the best present I have ever purchased for my 13 year old son. He has always been a tactile learner, and this allowed him to create so many cool projects in a safe environment. He constructed a light, an alarm, and a lie detector with these circuits. He spent hours with this, and learned at the same time!!!"
4,Good product,"My daughter (11yr) reall likes it and plays with it. I have to explain the concepts of electricity (voltage, resistance, current) etc."
3,Good toy!,"Got this set as a birthday gift to my son, instead of getting him a video game. I must say he and I were pleasantly surprised. He likes it and likes making projects. The only catch is they say 300+ projects (actually 305) but some of them are like variations of a base project.Overall, this is a good gift."
5,Amazing learning toy!,"This is AMAZING! My husband and 7 year old son spent 2 hours playing with this and making the horn blow, propeller turn, and more. Very very user friendly, yet very learning oriented, too. LOVE IT!"
5,Great Learning Toy,"Gave this to my 8 year old grandson for his birthday. He started playing with it immediately with me doing some coaching. Well, OK, I was playing with it also. LOL His 5 year old brother also joined in the fun."
4,"cool, but",My 9 year old got this for his birthday and has fun building the different types of circuits. The only downside is that it doesn't do a very good job explaining what is happening in each circuit. Overall pretty cool.
5,Hours of fun!,"My husband was afraid our son wouldn't use this or be interested in it when I ordered it for him for his 8th birthday. My son is into things the typical 8-year-old is: trampoline, skateboarding, scooter riding, playing outside, Star Wars, Legos, etc., so we were unsure of doing the more educational scientific type of gift. He actually was and is very excited about it and LOVES to make things that work. It also gives he and his daddy some quality one-on-one time to sit down and build things together, so he enjoys that too. Even my older boys who are now grown men and were here for the birthday party seemed really intrigued by the gift. They lingered near the table, wanting to try some things for themselves, so it was a great gift all around."
5,entertaining and educational,"I got this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. She likes to make her own experiments, but the manual comes with over 100 ways to set up the circuits, so it can really keep your kids busy."
5,Love science!,My son got this as a Christmas gift. He has been playing with it since he got it! Lots of fun and different circuit experiements to try! Great toy
5,love this!,I bought this for my daughter for her 9th birthday. She loves them and so does her younger brother. I'm a little worried about all the small parts that they can lose but for now they are still in the tray they came in.I like watching them learn about circuits and what works and what does not as they are trying to make a light turn on or music play.
4,Looks great,"Bought it for a birthday present - son hasn't had his birthday yet. But it looks great, lots of projects in the book to give direction on what to make. I'm sure he is going to want to take it to school for science class."
5,Just Amazing,"I by chance happened upon this product by searching the internet for ""top rated toys"". I was intrigued as I looked at it on Amazon and purchased it for my 6 year old grandson for christmas. To say the least, he was thrilled after we built our first project. We built a second project together and he took it from there. He completed all projects within a couple of weeks and he is on round 2. Now my grandson is a gifted child and he is tough to find gifts for since he gets bored with them quickly, so obviously his Mother and I were thrilled by his interest in the (Toy? doesn't quite describe the product) and I am very pleased that I can now get upgrade kits for him to enjoy in the future. I am absolutely thrilled with the quality, simplicity and concept of the product. This is a teaching tool if anything and should be a must for any child who likes to be challenged and build things. Thank you Snap Circuits."
3,Great most played with toy over Christmas,Son age 10 couldn't put this toy down on Christmas Day think he worked through almost every example in book - was loved more than the DS and that is saying something
5,Excellent choice - even for 4 year olds!,"My 4 and 5 year olds love it! I've tried out other circuit kits for my curious pair, but the instructions were too technical and the connections too prone to error. These instructions are easy to follow and include brief explanations as each new concept is introduced. Each piece has the correct technical symbol printed on it, so they will be able to relate this knowledge to schematics later on and, with adult supervision, these snaps work right every time.It's colorful too, so even my 'artistic' child is excited to join the fun! This is GREAT for homeschoolers!"
4,Great gift for any child,"This is a great toy for any child, especially ones between 9 and 15----It is very educational and easy to understand and will create hours of enjoyment.Well constructed, great instructions, and stores parts easily after use."
5,The only Xmas toy still being played with!,"I bought this for my 11 year old son who just has to know how everything works. He plays with this thing all day everyday. There are so many different projects to make and they are educational as well. For example one he did today he needed two different kinds of water for, plain and salt and had to figure out the difference between the two. We finally found something to make him put down the video games. We homeschool and I could not ask for a better science unit at such a fantastic price!"
4,What a great toy,I got this for my 8 year old. We have made many of the possible circuits that come in the instruction book. I love that we can do this together and he can also work on it alone. It is education and very sturdy. the only item that broke was one of the wires that had snaps on each end. He tried to pull it off using the wiring instead of grabbing the snap. Even without the wire we have been able to continue to make circuits.
5,The most perfect toy I've seen.,"My 9-year old has been playing with this almost exclusively since he got it for Christmas.Each electronic piece is complete with the actual electronic symbol for that component, and the way that the pieces snap together is nearly foolproof. A very small handful of the projects aren't that special, but even some of the ones that I thought my son would not appreciate gave him delight.The look on my son's face when he made the AM radio and dialed in his first station, which, since it was night, was hundreds of miles away in Canada was priceless.Be careful. Electronics can cause problems, and if you short the battery you will have a big mess, but so far, he hasn't even come close.A perfect toy."
5,"Excellent, and a new low price","Assuming the child is interested (rarer and rarer now a days), this kit is excellent. It's a good segue to the microprocessor kits for older kids."
4,Tons of Fun!,"This snap circuit provides hours of fun but it lacks the educational component. My son loved it but had many questions. For the most part I searched online for answers. Overall, I think kids and adults will enjoy creating the different patterns."
5,Great Buy,"I bought this for my 8 year old son, he has enjoyed it and it has been a really nice purchase. I would suggest you purchase this, especially if you have a little one that is really showing interest in buidling or taking things apart! It is a great learning toy, all the pieces were located. I would rate this toy a 10."
4,Great science and fun!,The manual is easy for anyone over 8 to use with very little help. Great design. My son loved the smaller set two years ago so at 11 he was ready for this bigger set. Great for young science and building fans.
5,Like Father Like Son,"My (then 8-year-old) son received the Snap Circuits (SC-300) for Christmas last year. He wouldn't put it down for days and still plays with it often, sometimes for hours. I loved electronics growing up and have fun with this product myself. I'm getting ready to purchase two replacement parts and the upgrade kit (to make my son's kit the equivalent of a Snap Circuits Pro (SC-500). We have had a few parts break, but overall the product is outstanding. Anyone interested in this product should strongly consider spending the extra $$$ and purchase the ""Pro"" SC-500. You'll end up upgrading anyway eventually!!!"
5,My nephew loved it!!,Great educational toy that was really appreciated by my nephew and his friend who spent hours playing with it.Once they had batteries all was ok!!!
2,My son loves it but it doesnt work,"I got it for my son for Christmas. He started to play with it and quickly found out that some of the parts do not function. Very dissapointing, because now it will just sit untouched. I now feel that is was a waste of money. Poor quality control."
5,GREAT toy for a 9 year old!,"We bought the Snap Circuits SC-300 for our son's 9 year old birthday... he was busy for hours making various things (including an AM radio). It's perfect for kids who like to experiment and create with electronics. Some of the pieces are small, but the packaging makes it easy to store everything. He loved it so much that we bought the Snap Circuit Rover for this Christmas - can't wait to watch him put it together! All of the sets can be used together."
5,Great Toy!,I got this toy for my 12-year-old godson. He's totally thrilled with all the different projects and the different levels of difficulty. Within just a day he was creating his own projects and discovering new things he can create. He's so excited he never puts it down--it's the first thing he plays with in the morning and the last thing he does before going to bed. Rock on!
4,nice educational product,a nice educational toy for my 9 year old.teaches basic electronics with simple experiments.stimulates the young mind.my son loves it.
5,Hours of Fun and Educational Too,The 7 year old who got this last month loves it. It is a great toy for any kid who loves to tinker. A great toy to bond with your kid since adults will enjoy it too! Great buy!!
5,6 Year Old Boy Loves it,I got this as a present for a boy turning 6 and he really loves it. He has just started kindergarten and is generally a bright kid.
5,Great projects,"My almost 7 year old daughter loves to make these projects. Right now she definitely needs supervision, mostly for the explanations. There are 2 books of projects and once you understand the basics you can play around with designs yourself. I think that might be a year or so ahead for her. I know I have enjoyed playing with it."
5,OUR GRANDSON WAS THRILLED,Our grandson could not say enough good things about this product. He is having the time of his life building the devices in the book.
5,Perfect Gift for my 8 year old,"Do you have a kid who loves to ""tinker"" and take things apart and put them back together? Well, if so, you will love this gift. I had to sit down with him initially and show him a few things he could ""snap"" together to make a fan run, a light to light up, or an fm-transmitter to work. He loves it and has had hours of fun playing by himself without and showing it to his friends as well."
5,My grandson loves snap circuits,Snap circuits are a hit with my 7 year old grandson. So I got this more advanced set for him for Christmas so he can do more experiments.
4,NOt packaged well,Did not like the way it was packed. Not enough packing to keep it from moving around. Box too big
5,Hours of entertainment!,My son received this set for Christmas and it is by far one of his favorite gifts. He has worked non stop at doing the projects that it gives you instructions for. As soon as he finishes one project he is on to the next. The set is extremely well made and I love that my son is not playing video games or watching tv. He is totally engrossed in all of the possibilities that he can make. My only disappointment is that I did not purchase the larger set. My son is 10yrs old.
5,My nephew loved this,"I'm a big geek, so picked this for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas. It was a big success, we built several of the easy projects together, then jumped ahead to the AM radio. The next day he played with it alone, and is able to follow the diagrams to build the projects."
5,Great product !!! Easy with parental help in some areas as to why circuits work !!!,My 6 year old grandson is hooked on snap circuits and with all the different layouts he will be challenged for awhile!!! Great gift!!!
4,Great toy,This was on my daughters Santa list and her Grandpa had one at his house. She is ten and loves making things . She has a few of the projects memorized and can do them quickly. She needs help in doing some of the harder ones but really enjoys it . very easy to follow and made to last . Great for 8 and up or younger if they can keep up with the parts . The smaller project one is just enough stuff for my child to do.
5,Excellent!,"This was a gift to a bright 7 year old girl. She loved it instantly. It educates in a fun, exciting way and is easy enough for a 7+ year old to do with just a little help getting started from an adult.Not only is it fun and educational but it also fosters a real sense of accomplishment.Unquestionably, this is absolutely one of the best gifts you can get a 7-12 year old."
5,My Boys Love This Toy,"I bought this toy for my 12 year old son, he loves it. My 8 year old wants one now. They have been playing with it almost non-stop since they got it for Christmas. They love doing all the different experiments. I plan on getting some more sets for them to play with."
2,Not the same Marcia Griffiths I used to know,"Beware . . . listen carefully to the sample tracks.If you're looking for the 1960's reggae-rocksteady Jamacian royality that I was looking for . . . go look somewhere else. This has a modern beat, not the classic melodic Studio One sound of yesteryear. Not my cup of tea, maybe yours."
4,Useful but not the key item...,"This is one of the ""made easy"" books. I found it quite useful but still not the best one I could get. I am a high school senior and I've been making class presentations every week or so. This book gave lots of ideas with those and some tips. I used some tricks and they were successful. I can't say I loved this book but it worths a try..."
2,PLASTIC - NOT CHROME,"This is made of PLASTIC - not chrome...The part that holds the shower head arm broke the second time I used the shower... We got two - the one in the guest bath is looser so that one is okay... The one that broke in our master bath was a lot tighter, and I went to adjust it and it just snapped. My husband went to Home Depot and got a new generic attachment for about $7, so it's fine... except that this says ""chrome"" which is nothing more than a cheap decal over plastic... Nowhere here or on any site that sells this is that made clear.For less money, next time I'd get the other brand w/ the charcoal filter...which is also PLASTIC... but at least for less money!I also have to agree w/ another reivewer of the charcoal filters... unless you have an alergy or really sensitive skin, the filter isn't going to do too much that is noticable... my hair comes out pretty much the same (on the dry frizzy side until I get product in it and use my flat iron)."
2,Broke within 3 days of delivery,"Within three days of use, the arm that holds the showerhead in place broke. --The third time I took the showerhead out of it's holder, one of the plastic ""wings"" that holds it in place broke off. -I e-mailed the company who shipped the product & they just told me to call another number (the manufacturer), which I did, and could never get anyone on the line who would help me. --I ended up having to buy a replacement part at a local hardware store...Not worth the money."
3,good filter but plastic part that holds shower head broke 6 months in,"Others seem to have had the same problem ... the part that holds the shower broke just trying to replace the shower head. Very flimsy construction, filter is ok, though."
2,Not Enough Water Pressure,"This shower head is ""OKAY"" but I am not impressed with it. There is not enough water pressure for my liking and the different spray options are limited. It also sprays a small area & I really wish that it had a wider spray option. I do like that it is a handheld for cleaning the shower and that it is filtered."
4,Sprite Royale Deluxe Hand Held Chrome Chlorine Removing Shower Filter,Sprite Royale Deluxe Hand Held Chrome Chlorine Removing Shower FilterSprite Royale Deluxe Hand Held Chrome Chlorine Removing Shower FilterI like it
5,Finally! the perfect showerhead!,"This is the 3rd handheld shower head ive bought in the past month. if you check out my other reviews, you can see what i thought of the first 2 showerheads i tried. i finally found one that is exactly what i wanted. filtered water with NO lack of pressure! all 5 of the spray settings are great, and i found one that's perfect for me- lots of pressure but with the water still flowing out in wide streams, so it feels great! also it's easy to turn the dial to adjust the water settings, and each different setting clicks into place. the handle is easy to grip, the hose is plenty long, and hangs great. i highly recommend this one! oh, i got mine from mr water filter . com."
3,Too heavy,"This handheld shower looks nice and I assume the filter makes the water better for my family, but is bulky to hold and is very heavy."
4,Life Preservers: Good Advice When you Need it Most,"I liked the book. It didn't always apply to me, but good to read anyway."
4,Filled with a few gems,"I think this is Hal's best album in quite awhile. I have to disagree with some of the other reviewers in that I don't think he is trying so hard for radio airplay. I think that Rodney Crowell has produced a very good selection of songs. Two of the best are his own, Dreams of Martina and Loving You Makes Me a Better Man. True, not all 12 songs are masterpieces but without question it is filled with some memorable songs and strong vocals from Hal."
4,Great Collection of Music,Great variety of music from these decades. Bought this for my husband who likes the older country music. He listens to it in his truck all the time.
4,CHAIRS,I love the chairs mix them with my old dinner chairs. Updated my dinner look great. Maybe I will order two more later on.
3,Victoria Chairs,"Overall, the chairs are okay. Assembly was horrible. The holes did not line up on one of the chairs, and with an allen wrench, it's pretty hard to force it, so I ended up with a very sore thumb from turning so hard. After assembly, the velcro finish for the skirts was also a bit sloppy. It looks like I made the skirt myself. The chairs are pretty comfortable, material is okay, I will end up getting slip covers if the skirts don't relax a bit. If it were not for my lack of patience with returns,I probably would have sent them back."
4,Ferrari F430,"Item arrived on time, and was as advertised. Item was part of a Cars collection that I assembled for my son, for Christmas. He liked it because it is different from the typical Cars selection. And because it was a Ferrari!"
3,"Beautiful, but looks fake","Yes, it seems false, because the other cars I bought from the same collection are different, seem stronger and the eyes of the car moves, as in 3D."
4,A wonderful book by the author of the Princess Bride,"I've had this book forever and had no idea it was rare. I love it because it is clear at a younger age but doesn't get boring or repetitive, as one of those classic books that just get better. I think it is superior to the Princess Bride as the characters are beleivable. I highly recommend it!"
3,Washing machine,I bought this toy for my 3 year old. He has been playing with it from the moment it was delivered. The toy is lots of fun. However it is not very durable.the door keeps breaking off when he opens and closes it. The opening is also very small just big enough to fit a sock or small towel. I recommend tis toy if your child loves to clean like mine but just expect to keep re-attaching the door.
1,A boring toy!,I purchased this washing machine for a birthday present for a 5 year old girl! She played with it only for a day and then went to the toy box. Never touched since then!
4,Romantic Romance,"The reviewer who labeled Dona St. Columb as an adulterer is technically correct but obviously doesn't suspend his/her disbelief when reading. This book is one of the most romantic stories ever written. I re-read this book every couple of years just for fun. Lush language, this story of a woman and her pirate lover is just plain fun."
5,Horribly Romantic,"My tastes in books and music vary wildly, but this book has been a favorite since I first read it at 13 (20-ish years ago.) The pirate is a perfect symbol for the ""lawlessness"" of love; love does not follow rules and boundaries imposed upon it by our social conventions. It is primal and magic, and creeps silently and unexpectedly up to our shorelines in the dead of night."
5,MARVELOUS~~~ctrin@iwvisp.com,"I enjoyed this book, the movie, and the audio book that I take along on my trips and I never get tired of listening and reading about the cabinboy and the captain. Real romance. No sex just imagination, which sometimes is better than words."
3,"Good, but not up to Du Maurier's others","I consider Daphne Du Maurier to be my favorite author. She is engaging, clever, and an inspiration to us all. I was disappointed, however, with this book. I mean, it is a good read, but it just doesn't live up to Du Maurier's other books. The plot is very predictable and not very original as there is the star-crossed lovers aspect involving the ""bad"" pirate and the good English noblewoman. But that clever way of writing that can be only attributed to Du Maurier is present, and Du Maurier's magical way of taking one out of his world and setting him on a tree to watch a noble woman come cautiously through the woods to meet her pirate lover is still there. Read this book. It surpasses many, but does not represent the best that Du Maurier can do."
3,"Good, but not better than Indu Sundaresan's previous books","This book is decent, but definitely pales in comparison to either ""The Twentieth Wife"", or ""A Feast of Roses"", both of which are among my favourite books ever. While the book is written well and eventually captivates a reader, the plot takes a while to unfold, and at times seems a little dull. Sundaresan however, still strikes me as a wonderful author and I look forward to reading her books for years to come!"
4,Splender of Silence review,"I love India and books about India so this was very interesting to me. Splender is a romantic novel set in 1942. The lovers are a young Indian woman and an American soldier who comes to her city looking for his missing brother. The author really did excellent research to make the place, time and people live. The details show the relations between the Indians, hindu and moslem, and the British. Shocking prejudice on all sides."
5,Excellent book,The Splendor of Silence was a book that I could not put down and at the same time I did not want to end. Indu Sundaresan weaves historical information into a beautifullly written novel that has you truly caring what happens to the characters. I highly recommend this book along with the Feast of Roses.
2,Not very good-disappointed,"I'm surprised that Indu's work this time held no magic for us. The book is intelligent in the sense that author has done a lot of research on the India before independence, but still something went a miss. Characters were not coherent and lacked a bonding among them; I feel the author didn't connect them well. Sorry to say that Indu but this book reminded me of a well written Bollywood story, with love affairs, brother to save, daughter reading mom's story and knowing her via letters, british soliders as villians..etc.etc..."
2,Couldn't stick with it,"The book has its good points, but it was too tedious, overly dramatic and plodding for me to stick with it."
4,The Only Rambo Movies You Really Need!,"I'll be honest... I am not a big Rambo fan. While I always enjoyed the original, First Blood, and the newest movie, Rambo, non of the in-between movies are entertaining for me. I have always ran into a three-pack at the stores, which only include the first three, so why pay for two movies I have no interest in?After reading a short review from blu-ray dot com, I'd agree that the picture is never very bright, but it is part of the film style since much takes place at night and in the woods. There's no overly done artificial noise reduction BS taking place to smooth out the film grain, so the images has plenty of detail for an older film. The surround sound I don't remember jumping out at me as a phenomenal experience, just average. Or if I had to rate it maybe I'd classify it as ""like the rest and not a tick better.""So, if you're like me, and you only want to watch and own the ""good"" Rambo's... THIS is the combo pack for you!"
4,Must have for NWA collectors,"I like this book mainly because it's a good historical account of Northwest from start-up through the mid 80's, right up to the merger with Republic. So, if you grew up flying Northwest in the 60's and 70's, there's lots of interesting reading and rare photos."
5,For The Troops,"I saw her for the first time while performing live at a USO concert for the troops in Iraq. She was AMAZING! Her voice was magnificent and her wonderful spirit was so prevalent in her music. I wasted no time buying her CD...My personal favorites on her debut album are ""Just Another Mountain"" and ""New Night Dawning."" She is bound to be the next big thing in country music. Keep rockin' Carly!!"
3,Goodwin Can Get Better,"Carly Goodwin's self-titled album is OK, but not much more. There's not much on here that really got my attention or got me humming along. Carly's voice is fine, but still kinda girlie, not fully mature. The content of the songs is unexceptional. Destination Heartache is the only really good tune on here, a nice upbeat country tune. A little maturing and Carly might have something really good. She's not there yet."
2,Tried and true...and awaiting something new?,"Carly has a wonderfully colorful voice. When I first heard her sing on her debut album, I thought; ""Wow, this kid has some talent..."" But...it's been about two years now and still no follow-up album? Was this it....a one-trick pony of a career? I certainly hope not."
3,Not for big tools,"I bought this book because I had the impression it would contain a wide range of jigs for big tools like table saws, stationary routers, etc. There were some jigs for those, but not as many as I expected. The jigs shown for all the other (smaller tools) are very good. The books gives an impression of being very old by showing pictures with tools my father used to have when I was young, but jigs used then are still useful."
1,Cheap junk.,"This mower worked great the first time I used it. The second time, when I backed up with it, it ate the flap on the back that blocks grass from coming out at you. It shattered the flap, dinged up the mower blade, and bent the shaft that holds the mower blade straight. When I restarted the mower, the blade would hit the frame, and black smoke came out of the muffler. I called in for the warranty, took it to an authorized shop, and all the warranty would fix was the grass flap. The mower mechanic told me that he will ""See you next year to replace that muffler"". I asked him what he meant, and he said ""Those mufflers have to be replaced once a year for $50.00"" He also proceeded to tell me that I paid too much for such a basic mower. Spend a little extra and get something with a little better quality. I mean who makes a lawn mower that you cannot go backwards with? This thing self destructs if you do."
4,Great mower for the price,"Great deal. $[...] less than any store, plus I got the free super saver shipping. Have mowed 4 times with it, does well. The other review touting this as cheap junk is a laugh. Well go find a less expensive mower, you wont. Plenty of power for longer grass. Its not a Honda, its not a LawnBoy, but its not $[...] either. And don't believe that line about the muffler wearing out and costing $[...] dollars. Its the exact same muffler on my 8 year old mower that I'm ditching. (The 8 year old muffler is fine.) I have pulled it backwards to have the flap go under the back a hundred times and it does not chew it up. Clearly the man giving him advice was selling a competitors mower. This thing is good for the price."
5,A Slightly Different Firewater....,"...But evolution is just all part of The Fittest Regime.This album emerges as, possibly, one of the greatest, musically, and foreshadowing, lyrically, of this year.The sound is slightly different from previous Firewater albums, not as many how-would-one-pronounce-this? instruments and we find Tod A. using his full vocal range; gritty, raw, whispered.And, of course, the spear in the side of christianity gets pushed in a little deeper.This is without a doubt, one of the must-have albums of 2001.If you're a fan of Firewater or just drinking, sex and criminals buy this album now."
5,Skillful angst,"I downloaded this album from emusic.com, having never heard of the band before. I was totally impressed. The skill and nuances in this angst ridden, and intelligent, rock that I simply must buy the album outright (emusic.com's albums are all 128mhz, which just isn't enough for these guys). Looking forward to pumping this through my car stereo!"
1,Tape Measure???,Very simply put - YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!These aren't even of sufficient quality to give away as gifts to your competition so that they will mess up their work.Don't waste your money unless you only wany to put in your drawer/tool box for appearance.
2,a bad idea,"Matching up Aretha's Eighties hits with her Sixties and Seventies work was a bad idea. The synths and fake-o drums that were the rage back in 1985 just sound soul-less next to ""Bridge Over Trobled Water,"" ""Chain of Fools,"" and the like. Not to say the Eighties were a bad decade for Aretha - her pop stands well above what some other soul icons were putting out at the time. Those years were recently anthologized in a greatest hits package some time back and are best kept separate. Buy that record, plus ""30 Greatest Hits,"" and you've got the woman's best in a nutshell."
2,badly recorded,"I already own this and am from this generation so I can tell you that she sounds much better than this recording. Either Rhino set the recording levels wrong or used 3rd or 4th generation copies because there is too much distortion at the extremes. It plays in my cd player but the Imac rejects it. Some of the songs sound better than others (Since You've Been Gone, See Saw etc.). I will try to find one that was mastered later after the tech got better."
3,Ambler is an Oldie but Goodie,"I decided to read this book because I had tried some current suspense fiction but was boggled by the drone-on, convoluted writing style. Is there no one who writes, clear crisp English with interesting characters and easy-to-follow plotlines? I asked myself. The answer was Yes! Eric Ambler. I've read most of his books but not this one. I vaguely remembered A.A. Simpson from the ""Light of Day.""So I was pleased to discover just the sort of book I was looking for: sly humor, great human insight and a plot that started, continued and ended satisfactorily. (Thank you!) The three reviews that follow mine are excellent, by the way, especially the first one."
4,never dull,"Arthur Simpson, man without a country is trying desperately to get a passport, any passport,the country is of no consequence. To do this he needs cash, so he is hired to make a pornographic movie but that goes pear shaped.After his directing debut he finds himself on a ship hiding but he still has no passport. On board thanks to the fact that he is an inveterate liar he signs a contract to fight with a band of mercenaries in a African back water that is hoping to realise great mineral wealth.So, even though our hero is a loser, liar and not a very nice person he manages to land on his feet, if not entirely squarely.Eric Ambler does not write dull stuff, this isn't one of his best works but its pure entertainment from the start, if you are lucky enough to find it at a garage sale, grab it."
4,A haunting and subtle book,"This is a brilliant geographical study by a scholar who has reconstructed an aftermath of World War I which has had almost no attention paid it: the reconstruction of the ruined Western Front zone.It is meant for serious readers, but the book itself is a great piece of history and geography.Outstanding."
2,Disappointed,I probably should had paid more attention to the songs included on this CD. It got played once and then forotten
5,It 's All Good,I wanted this CD very much. My husband got it for me. I like listening to the music. The CD was in great condition.I am happy that I was able to get - In Season: The Frankie Valli & 4 Seasons Anthology.
4,All but some not wanted,"This set appears to have ""All"" of the Four Seasons' works, which after 1968 most of their songs are uneventful if not boring. They tried to stay to remain ""hip"" alongside groups like the Beatles and others, but just couldn't compile the material to do so. Still, the earlier songs remain classics as they still mesmerize one's youthful fantasies. Bottom line is it's a worthy purchase."
5,A must jave,"This is THE Four Seasons album. You will not find a more complete group of songs. It has every hit and most of the near hits. The only song missing is ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"" off their Christmas album.Buy it you will like it."
5,Frankie & The Four Seasons Anthology Review,"Frankie and The Four Seasons didn't leave anything out of this set! It's a walk down Memory Lane.This collection of hits includes all a fan could ask for: Sherry, Walk Like A Man, My Eyes Adored You, and the theme from Grease, just to name a few. Frankie nailed it back in the day, and he still nails it today!"
5,4 Season's CD Set,"I had just seen the Jersey Boys in Vegas and wanted to buy some original CD 's of the 4 Seasons. I bought this set and have been playing it non stop for the last month! It covers all their years up to Grease. Has a wonderful companion booklet with stories and not only who the writers were of each song, but also, what year it hit the pop chart and what # it got to.I highly recommend this CD set."
1,Heresy Lies Bigotry Racist,"This Bible is nothing more than a Racist giving his views on the holy scriptures(something is definitely wrong here)! This Bible is full of unscriptual beliefs ex. a pre Adamite world ruled by Lucifer, the world was not created by God, it was re-created by God, after Lucifer created it. and these are just a few examples of the heresy and lies in this book. My recommendation is to have this book removed from the shelves of all the book stores. It is a insult to the Holy Word of God, and a spit in the face of my Saviour Jesus Christ."
5,Very Satisfied,"I found your price to be very sufficient and the delivery was even better. No worry, I will use you for my future book purchases.Thanks"
1,A Revised Opinion of this work- Caveat Emptor!,"I must apologize for leading astray. In a previous review of this work (A Reader from Everett, WA, I Highly Recommended this work.Unfortunately, I had not fully understood Dake's teachings on vital subjects such as the Trinity and Deity of Christ and other Theological important topics. I have also learned that these are the bible notes that are the FOUNDATION of bleeding edge Pentecostalism: Benny Hinn, Hagin, Copeland, Toronto Vineyard.Heretical teachings abound within!I must therefore publicly retract my previous recommendation, and confess my ignorance.If you are interested in the problems of this work, try an internet search engine with the words Dake AND heresy."
3,What's your budget?,"Do you own a 27 inch TV with a $27 DVD player? Don't bother. Do you own a $5000 amp, a $3000 DVD player, and a set of speakers that you might bury yourself in? Don't bother buying, unless you want to burn money. Monster may look pretty, and the performance of Monster vs. no name is certainly proven in the quantifiable scientific analysis...but your ear can't hear it.Simply put, buy comparable cables with and without the Monster name and run a test with your ears. You will probably find that you can save yourself significant $ by purchasing equally constructed cabling without the Monster name..."
5,Preserving Character,"Johnathan Shay's book is outstanding! Though he wrote from the perspective of a civilian without the experience of Vietnam, he accurately captured and described the psychological baggage that so many Vietnam vets carried home and continue to struggle with every day. His comparison of the Vietnam soldier to Achilles was an apt observation and his conclusions very sound. I found this book to be most useful as a leadership guide for military officers and NCO's. No doubt, many of those principal elements that contributed to the onset of PTSD could very well have been prevented or lessened by prudent and deliberate leadership."
1,Thersites in Amazon,"Before buying this book and above all before taking it seriously, note the three pages devoted to it in Stolen Valor : How the Vietnam Generation was Robbed of its Heroes and its History, by B. G. Burkett and Glenna Whitley. According to these authors, Shay failed to check any of the veterans' stories he relates, swallowed much absurdity whole, and is consequently a poor guide to the psychological toll of the Vietnam war."
4,Very Favorable,As a Viet Nam era veteran I never understood or really believed post traumatic stress syndrome. I believed it was just an excuse for disfunctional individuals or midlife crises. This book changed my views to a better understanding of this condition and it's objective symptoms.
5,Good Book,"This book presents an interesting and thoughtful perspective on trauma in battle, as it compares and contrasts PTSD in ancient history and in modern times. It also offers tips on how to deal with it."
5,best traffic album,"i think this is their greatest album;vagabond virgin kinda bores me but the rest is phenomenal. pearly queen is among their greatest tracks, 40,000 headmen is great lyrically, as is feelin' all right, means to an end, and don't be sad, a quite underrated masterpiece from this record. traffic were really among the first 'do it all ' combos, this record features wonderful songwriting and tight, amazing playing. there is hard rock, jazz, folk,blues west indian music, psychedelia,and soul to be found here,among other genres i always felt the pre- barleycorn material tended to be much better.it;s too bad the 2 cd anthology smiling phases appears to be out of print, it was a fine introduction to this incredible band. any kids out there who think of steve winwood only as the composerof overplayed aor boredom should buy this record. its funny how such great talents of the day got so bland so quick after starting out with such a bang( see contemporaries chicago, jethro tull, santana, etc.)"
5,Classic Traffic album - Classic Quality,"Take the advice of another reviewer and get the US version, with good, clear, punchy sound - and no irrelevant extra tracks. This is the classic Traffic including Dave Mason with great songs and performances all round."
5,My Favorite Gluten-Free Pasta!,"This is my all-time favorite gluten-free pasta. I like that the noodles don't have a flavor that competes with the sauce (we make our own, and it is realy good!)"
1,Too Basic,"The idea behind this book is admirable, and the author has many years of experience in community service, but the information is very basic, not scholarly. Nuestros Niños reads like its been written off-the-cuff, and the author states her opinion and religious beliefs as a matter of fact."
2,Golf Organizer,"The item is built well, but it doesn't hold two bags well. I had to stuff both of my bags and one still hangs out a bit. For two starter bags its great, but not for normal to larger bags."
4,Ok organizer,Works well and was pretty easy to assemble. Its made of weak material that was already bent out of the package. I bent it back but don't expect high quality material.
2,Not so much...,I work out of the country so throughout the year I do a lot of on-line shopping. Found this and thought it would help with keeping my closet clean (my wife uses my closet for a dumping ground including both sets of our golf clubs) while I'm away at work. Product arrived and my son attempted to put it together but wasn't very successful. My wife says the mesh netting at the back arrived with two (2) large holes in it. Like the idea and design from the picture but this purchase doesn't seam to be working out. Will be sending it back as soon as my son can get it to fit back into the box it arrived in.
4,Suncast golf organizer,"Really sturdy, nice looking and worth the money.I dinged it one star for the following reasons:- Mesh; It was very slightly damaged in 2-3 areas.- Assembly; parts weren't completely and clearly labeled, and this made it a little difficult to put together.- Total assembly time was about an hour."
3,Very difficult to assemble,"I would say quality is average. Assembly is no easy task as holes don't always lineup well and screws are very loose fitting so often difficult to align. Best to have two people for assembly. However, once assembled it does the intended job very well."
4,Acceptable,"I frankly wasn't expecting much but it does the job it supposed to do.Pros: Holds and organizes two golf bags, three shoes and miscellaneous small stuffCons: Will be a tight fit for two large cart bags, if the bags have a rigid top, you may not be able to fit them both"
1,Poorly Made,"I received the Suncast Organizer. The item did not have adequate packaging with Styrofoam. The mesh back of product was bent.The allen wrenches that came with it did not fit the holes in the in the screws. The holes in the in the actual product were either not drilled out or poorly drilled out and the feet would not fit into the bottom of it.I would not recommend this product due to the construction, quality and weight issue.Overall the product was poorly made and not worth the money.I have sent this back to Amazon and did not request a replacement. I would not recommend this product however Amazon has been great."
3,Came damaged but ok,Great idea - keeps my golf clubs and supplies organized. The product came damaged but we were able to work with what we got to make it functional. Would have like to had it perfect but it essentially works fine.
4,It takes two.,"This item is easier to put together with 2 people. Parts are labled with alphabetical stickers but there was no parts labled with letters in the instructions. I used the picture on the box to help me.I like that the allen screws came in a molded plastic container, I did not have to fumble around trying to match up a nut and a bolt. The unit holds my bag and my son's jr. set with ease. I like that the top shelf can hold alot of loose golf balls.Even with the lack of instruction, and the need I had for help to put together for the price and how much equipment it holds I gave it four stars."
4,Nice way to store golf stuff,Assembly instructions were only fair. But when assembled it looks good and stores a lot of golf accessories. I have just 1 bag and it would be a tight fit for two bags. But I do like the fact that while in the rack my bag won't tip over and damage my clubs and I only have to go to one place for my stuff.
4,Nice,"was easy to put together, however I wish it was a wider, it was hard to cram 2 golf bags in it, other than that it works fine."
4,I like this golf organizer,"This organizer is very affordable, easy to assemble, and it is very compact for a 2 bag organizer. I was actually able to mount mine to my garage wall for even better utilization of space."
3,Assembly Required...No Kidding!,"Wow.....I have assembled a lot of products, this was a challenge. The directions are cryptic, the screws are cheap and difficult to thread. I ended up with an extra screw which drives me nuts. The good news is that once I made it through, I like the organizer."
2,Suncast Golf Organizer #GO3216,"The instructions were very poorly written in order to assemble the product. Secondly, the connection did not completely match up so you need to use a drill to adjust the spots to allow for the nuts to slide through the joints."
4,Took Me By Surprise!,"I was given a copy of this book by a friend who told me I would really enjoy it, and to my surprise, I really did!I don't usually read stories like this, and not having not read anything by this author before, I was a bit cautious. But, I quickly found myself not wanting to put the book down. It was great.I highly recommend it.MK"
1,Utter Drivel,"Is this a vanity press? I gave this book 1 star because I couldn't give it zero. I want my $19.95 back! If I can stop one person from wasting his time with this steaming pile of dung, then it was worth the time it took to write this review."
5,Another great look at Gettysburg!,"Being a fan of Stephen Sears I was anxious to get my hands on this book as I have read many others of his. Sears style is clear, concise and interesting. Covering the great battle, Sears tackles a lot of ground from Lee's desires to take the war north of Virginia, Stuart's Cavalry operations, Union leadership, Confederate and Union positions, early marches and finally the battle itself. Sears always brings his words to life and this book is a great example of that. I liked reading about Lee's intentions as to why to press into Pennsylvania, Union leadership and Longstreet's approach to handling Lee's orders. These were just a few of the many great chapters inside this informative and entertaining book about the Battle of Gettysburg. 5 STARS!!!"
3,"great item, shipping inadequate","This book is one of three I purchased. They all came in the same box, and were poorly protected. The cover of one was scratched when it arrived, and according to the tracking information provided, the items sat in Jersey City for 6 days before heading to my town's post office. Annoying, because I can drive to Jersey City in about an hour. The books are fabulous, Amazon.com is not."
2,"Nothing new here, except Sears flaws","Writing a book on Gettysburg should, by now, be more than the excercise of putting the facts together in the correct order and sprinkling on commentary. That has been done more times than I can count. Unfortunately that is what Sears gives us. So in the face of superior books, especially Coddington's book, it is difficult to recommend this one. Once again, Sears puts forth a lopsided argument against those generals he's decided to dislike and for those whom he admires. This was the case in his books on the Seven Days and Antietam that are almost shrill in their attacks on McClellan and his book on Chancellorsville which excused Hooker because he may have had a concussion. What keeps Civil War books fresh is the commentary by their authors, but Sears style has always been too unilateral for my taste. He seems to use his arguments to support the battle and not the other way around."
3,Intimidating Tome,"This massive volume is meticulous in its detail and unrelenting in its description...however, it is a tough, plodding read...even for an avid history buff (and Pennsylvania native!) like myself. This is an impressive work for the experienced Civil War historian and often difficult to absorb for a reader with casual or limited interest...getting bogged down in the minutiae of battle strategy. I suspect it's more a matter of left/right side of the brain! As impressive as it is, this book is more for the mathematician than the history lover."
3,Just...dull,A great author that suffers from a tremendously flawed narrative style; the good thing about this book is that is an extremely detailed account of the Battle of Gettysburg. The bad thing about this book is that it is an EXTREMELY detailed account of the battle of Gettysburg. At times this gets to be too much.Overall-When all is said and done not only will you know a lot about the Battle of Gettysburg you will feel as if you have actually fought the entire campaign (along with the entire war) by yourself.
5,Not the same old......,"Not just a book of dates and numbers.In depth work on Gettysburg,full of excerpts from soldier accounts.Very detailed.If you want to read a book about the battle and you want the most info you can get while keeping you interested in the next page....... this is the book for you."
5,Exceeded my expectations,"I've read lots of books on the Civil War and this is among the best written I've come across. Mr Sears has written an interesting, coherent and cogent study of the entire Gettysburg campaign. How often do books stop immediately after Pickett's charge? This book continues on through the return to Virginia. That's almost unique in the coverage of Gettysburg, I think. If you want a tractable one-volume account of the Gettysburg campaign, I doubt that there's a better candidate.This is the sort of book that make me wish I could write."
5,512MB MP4/MP3 Playing Watch with 1.5-Inch OLED Screen,This product was awesome. It had all the features I spected.
4,almost his very best,"It's too bad that whenever you mention Webb Widler's great sounds to people you also have to mention in the same breath phrases like ""under-appreciated"" and ""undiscovered"". If there was any justice in the world, Maria Carey would be scrubbing floors and Webb would have the audience he deserves. But he's not sexy enough, too Southern, too head-first, and too cool. Oh well.""Hybrid Vigor"" is a good place to start loving Webb's music but ""Doo Dad"" is the one to buy when you want to get married to his music."
4,rockin' and rootsy,"New wave rockabilly? Well, why not! Whatever you want to call the music of Webb Wilder, it was very energetic, very rockin' and very rootsy. No slick beat boxes or synthesizers on this baby. Hearing the songs on this album, it's clear that he and his band are doing this for the love of music and not out trying to score Top 40 hits. Fun? This album is that and more. Get rockin!"
2,"Nice, but no Whistle","The design is elegant and certainly fine to heat water.PROBLEMS:1. Handle and spout cap are deceiving. They do heat up and you do need a pot holder or towel to hold either the handle or certainly to open the spout.2. NO WHISTLEI guess I should have researched this kettle better. I have a lot of Le Creuset and trusted their quality and design ability. Anyone who makes tea, knows that you want to bring the water close to a boil, but not TO a boil- the whole principal of a whistle."
4,Well written but should rate either 3 plus or 4 minus!!,"I found this to be an engrossing read. It explained some areas of ""orthodoxy"" that were unknown to me. I really liked the way in which the author explained ""silence."" Found the characters [except those like Hartog, etal.] rather likable -- enough so that I cared about them, as well as what would happen in their lives. I really liked Esti & that she had spoken to Ronit's father -- that's all I can say without spoiling the book. It validates/reinforces the importance of our choices, and the impact of same in our lives, as well as in the lives of others. There was, at least for me, something missing. There is potential here & I would consider reading more of this author's work. This is an engrossing read which should satisfy many."
2,Could have been much better,"I'm in the minority here, but I was disappointed by ""Disobedience"". Whilst I applaud the author for tackling a difficult subject (lesbianism within the confines of Orthodox Judaism), I did not feel that the novel explored it well enough. The downfall of the novel was the poorly drawn main characters. I did not find the lesbian love story of Ronit and Esti believable at all. I found it hard to believe that someone like Ronit, who had escaped the suffocating confines of Hendon for the glamour life in New York, would be interested in rekindling a relationship with the childlike, inarticulate Esti. Their relationship did not ring true. Dovid, Esti's Rabbi husband, was also poorly drawn. No reason was ever given for him agreeing to marry a woman who he knew was a lesbian. Ms Alderman writes well about a fascinating topic, but in my opinion, the book was badly let down by poor characterisation."
2,runs out way to fast,I opribnt maybe 40 pictures and it runs out. At twenty six bucaroonies. That's a lot of money/ picture. I found out Costco will print pictures while you wait for Nineteen pennies a fraction of the copst.
1,Buy it from the store,"I purchased this item because it was very inexpensive. I should've followed my first instinct and went to the store. It does not work. My printer is not reading the cartridge. I went and bought one from the store, no problem at all."
3,"The pictures are great, the ink cost is high","I use HP 57 and HP 58 cartridges for 6-ink photo printing on my HP PSC 2210 multifunction machine. The photos look great on HP premium photo paper, just like the ones from my local 1-hour photo center. However, after 20 pages (about 60 4*6 photos), the HP 58 cartridge is gone, and there is only about 1/4 left on the HP 57 cartridge. This is killing me. I will just use the local photo lab from now on :-("
4,Great Cartridge At A Great Price,"I use this cartridge in an HP DeskJet 5150 printer. The printer always yields crisp, well defined color prints. Unlike some people I think that the cartridge lasts a reasonable amount of time, although I don't print photos very often, which can definitely use ink at a voracious pace.My biggest criticism of HP cartridges in general is the price, but the price here at Amazon is the best I have found, and I think the Amazon price point, particularly combined with free shipping and no tax makes this cartridge reasonably priced. Having said all that, there is one area where the product could be improved, which is the pronounced tendency of the ink to smear when wet. I realize that this is a not-unusual trait of inkjet printers, but I am more acutely aware of the problem with this printer and ink combination than with most other inkjet printers I have used.Overall the HP 57 is a good value for the money, particularly if you shop around for good deals."
3,poor information,"HP does not offer full information on number of color prints:Impossible to have an approximation of ink costs. Why so vague?Ex: 391 prints??? What size?ex: 15% Coverage??? Photos or text what size paper, 4x6, 8 1/2 x 11?Any variation of the above will make a great change in ink costs.Give us the approximate cost for any average 4x6 color photo.Give us the approximate cost of an average full page text with some color."
5,Best Color ink Value,"HP57 Ink is, without question, the BEST COLOR ink value on the market. Unfortunately, you'll be hardpressed to find any of HP's new printers using these. They're now using ink cartridges with much less ml's at a much higher price per ml. I've sent letters to HP regarding this, but have not received any response. This, of course, is quite disappointing particularly since their printers are among the best on the market."
1,Not the correct cartridge for HP Officejet 5610 All-in-one,Amazon is advertising that this cartridge is made for the HP Officejet 5610 All-in-one. This is not correct the only cartridges that work are 22 (Tri-color) 27/56 (Black) and 58(Photo)
3,typical HP ink cartridge,"what you'll get at WM, staples, etc... just a bit of a cheaper price here... wanna save a little money or get it sooner?"
1,Not the one that I expected,"Simply not the cartridge that I paid for. Instead, I received an old model of the same product, not the one that shows in the picture."
4,Buy on line,"I buy on line because there always deals. If I can save some money on products that I use all the time, why not!"
2,"Package was slightly damaged, opened and taped shut","Vendor sent a damaged and opened package that was taped closed. The foil package appears to be undamaged, but will not know until I need to use in printer."
5,It works,This is the ink that is recommended for my printer. It works. I recommend it for any of the printers listed on the packaging.
1,streaks across page,hp 57 won't workHP 57 Tri-Color Inkjet Cartridge (C6657AN)--what should I do with the Product??
1,I've decided that I don't like HP products anymore. They always let me down in some way.,"I've decided that I don't like HP products anymore. They always let me down in some way:* Bad printer software.* Ink out all the time.* Broken HP camera.* I had an HP 17' laptop with a 10-key; Sold it, was too time consuming to maintain it.* HP All-in-One printers (PSC 2110v) no longer support the newest Mac OS's for scanning. It's print only!?!?!?!?!"
4,It is colorful,"This is real ink. It is colorful. Comes in a cartridge. Fits my printer perfectly. Eliminated the warning message that had been coming up about low ink level. Eco freindly recycling envelope included at absolutely NO EXTRA CHARGE. Wow! All this for the amazingly stupid price of $30.Sorry, but I think it is silly reviewing ink."
4,How many HP 57 reviews do you need? It works. Here's how to get more out of it.,"Everyone has to have these, but you can refill them! I've had better luck with the HP56, but 57 can be refilled - Inktec makes a great fifteen dolla kit with everything you need. I can usually get 2 or 3 refills out of each cartridge before it's time to buy a new one from amazon."
5,Good quality ink cartridge,"I have ordered this on a number of occasions, and have found it to be excellent. The cartridge is good quality and produces excellent quality printouts, to the point that I will never go to a print shop to print out digital photographs because there is no need.I have used HP printing products exclusively for years now and have never had any difficulties with ink quality. However I do find that like other users the cartridge tells you you're running low long before it's necessary. When it's really running out I experience gradual reduction in quality of the images I print out and often parts of the page printing will fade out so that you get blank sections of the page. However when this happens there is usually plenty of time to change the cartridge unless you're printing out an urgent job."
3,HP 57 Tri-color Ink Cartridge,"I only use HP cartridges in my HP printer. I thought this was a very good deal, but the colors were off when compared to other HP cartridges. By the way, the item is in a bag, not a box. The vendor has offered to take the cartridge back, which is a satisfactory solution. This may be a one time problem, but I would not risk it again."
1,Ink Cartridge does not work.,I installed and re-installed this refirbished ink cartridge in my printer and now the display keeps showing an error message to check ink cartridge and the printer will not print at all...I will not buy a refirbished ink cartridge again.
4,Got the job done,"I received the cartridge quickly, in an undamaged box, and in good working order. I would definitely order from them again."
3,Two shipments,The second cartridge that was sent is fine...the first one had no ink in it. The seller apologized and sent the second one...so it could have been a mistake. So all is well that ends well.
5,It's an ink cartridge!,I got my order in a timely fashion and it is exactly what I expected - no big surprises with ink cartridges!
3,"Yes, it works fine, but...","I experienced no problems installing this ink cartridge. It worked fine. However, the original dried up after 6 months of scant use. Inkjet printers are incredibly wasteful and expensive to maintain. These cartridges should be designed to be refillable, not disposable! At the very least, one should be able to recycle the old cartridges. HP should sell refilled, used cartridges, or should sell a refill kit. How long are we going to continue to stuff our landfills with disposable use-it-once-and-throw-it-away junk?"
2,Ink lasted less than 30 days....,"I rarely print in color anymore because colored inkjet cartridges are so much more expensive. I try to print everything in B/W.I received my order less than 30 days ago, and I'm already running out of colored ink. I don't recall running out of colored ink this quickly when I purchased it from the stores. I'm a bit disappointed."
3,INK,"USED WITH DELL, I'M NOT IMPPRESSED.......... .......... ........... .......... ..... ......... ........ . ..... ...... ...... ............ ........ ...."
2,"expiration date March,2013","Package was delivered immediately, and in good condition.No outer box only foil package, which does not show expiration date. Mine was empty so I loadedit into printer and it showed than it was full of ink, but I find that they can dry up faster when'not used before expiration date."
4,Length,"The ink is great, though a bit difficult to put in compared to a smaller printer. The quality is great and it doesn't smudge. The only fault which i found with this ink cartridge was that it did not last very long. Though i print a reasonable amount each day, my former computer printed the same amount using less ink. If you want a fast printer then buy it. But if you want a printer that does not use alot of ink then don't buy it."
3,a worthwhile read for military sci-fi fans,"Eventhough this is not an earth-shattering book, volume II of Gammalaw is thoughtfully written. The book is much easier to read than volume I. The plot is well developed and the story flows smoothly. One gets a feeling for the chatacters in the book, various settings, and problems they have to overcome to survive. I am eager to read the other volumes in this series!"
4,"Great video, but too short!","I really enjoyed this video, but was so disappointed in how short it was. The actual workout is just under 13 minutes with the whole tape running 15 minutes. It's a nice fusion of dance, yoga, and pilates. It flows wonderfully. There are some advanced moves in it: shoulderstand, full backbend, one-armed planks, and the cow pose from yoga. The set is really pretty and the background music is classical guitar. I wish it was longer, but I will use it as an add-on video after other workouts."
4,Star was broken,"This is funny and very amusement of having little christmas time in your car.Bad, star was broken, but i could it put in."
5,renewed review,"I gave a neutral rating because I misinterpreted the size and usage but after gifting it to my son who was studying for finals, I've decided it is most entertaining for those in need."
2,Very brittle with broken pieces in shipment!,"Cute idea but item arrived broken and seller (IMPORTER 520) did nothing but offer half a refund!At least amazon did right by me but the seller did not!...We love Amazon,but will not be ordering anything from (IMPORTER 520)!"
4,I used it for a year,"I bought one of these LED Christmas trees for my computer at work. The tree has been plugged into my computer since last Christmas and runs 5 days a week, all day. It has stood up quite well to the use although recently one of the LED colours has died and I am here to get another one. I accept the fact that the LEDs don't last forever and I do not see this as a manufacturing fault, just a fact of life. It is a fun and festive way to brighten an office."
5,USB powereed Christmas Tree w//LED LIGHTS,"It is a very little cute tree, I bought it to sit on my computer as my appartment is too small for real one.I just love watching the lights change colors.Thinking about buying for gifts next year. I am very pleased with it. I'm giving one to my daughter-in-law this year and and I am sure she will be very happy with it. It is something she can sit on her computer at work."
4,cute little tree,lit up the place; is cute. i gave one to my brother and his wife and they seemed to like it
3,fog foam,bought it because it was a great price didn't use it for what I wanted to it is good for people in the arts for lighting
1,What Drivel.....,Gotta be hands down the WORST book I have ever read.....run on sentences permeate this book wanna be...surprised the authors don't have their arms in casts after all the back slapping they did...half the book is examples on how great their rehashed ideas are and the other is heaping praises or referencing themselves....a good example of schools requiring published authors so they are forced to publish drivel....what a load of crap....
1,ANNOYING!!!!,"The most annoying pop stars all came from the 80's.As much as I hate the poppy cheesey stuff of the 90's and todays,80's pop is the most aggravating.True,there is no way anyone on this CD is more aggravating than all europop(such as Eifell 65),but about everyone on here gets on my nerves.Every song on here is cheesy and ... and the lyrics make you SCREAM!!Walking On Sunshine is the most aggravating song on this CD.She Drives Me Crazy will drive you crazy(or insane).If you love cheesy music that is repetitive and annoying,then this CD is for you.Peace Out."
4,very good !,I had this album but not on cd.... it was good then.... and still isMica has a great voice .... listening to her just makes some good memories come back....I agree when they say that she is unde rated.... I believe she shoud be on top of the charts.... today still !!!
3,A decent edition,"I was pleased to get the book, but an editing error caused the index to be mangled, so it's difficult to find anything topically. Additionally, since the edition I purchased was pulled from an edition that lacked a title index, it's difficult to find anything. The company, however, has assured me that a new edition is coming that will contain both indices; I'm waiting on my new copy from the publisher. The typeface they use is easy on the eyes without being ridiculously large. If you need an edition just for your reference, this is good. If you're going to give a gift, I'd go with a different version."
1,This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST FILM I HAVE EVER SEEN,"I swear on the soul of my mother, the only way you could possibly laugh at any part of this film is to have some sort of brain damage or possibly be under the influence of a controlled substance. This movie was so terrible, Touchstone Pictures almost didn't release it - The script, the comedy, is as flat as week old beer - I did not once laugh at any part of this movie - the delivery of the actors' lines were stale and I felt worse about myself after forcing myself to sit through the entire thing - Shame on you Touchstone for allowing anything this pointless and boring to be made - To SUM UP - DO NOT Rent this - DO NOT purchase it, If someone gives you this movie as a gift - exchange it for something else - I have seen close over 100,000 films over the course of my lifetime - I beg you to trust me on this - Run, do not walk away from this utter failure trying to pass itself off as a movie -"
4,Enjoyable film!,"Frank McClusky, C.I. is not the best movie ever made, but it is enjoyable if you allow yourself to watch the movie for what it is. The movie was made to be slapstick and funny, it was never meant to be serious! Also, Dolly Parton later reported in a magazine the only reason she did this film was to send Hollywood a message that ""she would still do movies""!"
3,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",A INSURANCE CLAIMS ADJUSTER TAKES HIS JOB ALITTLE TOO SERIOUSLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT HE FEELS HIS DAD RECEIVED POOR CARE FROM THE INSURANCE AFTER AN ACCIDENT AS A MOTORCYCLE STUNT MAN. DOLLY PARTON IS THE MOTHER WHO AFTER HER HUSBAND DIES IN THE MOTORCYCLE CRASH RESPONDS BY HAVING HER KINDS IN HELMETS AND PADDED CLOTHES EVEN TO SLEEP. JM
1,Don't think so.,"Too outlandish to be funny. Story is less than medeocre. Definately not what I expected. There was only couple of funny parts, but thats IT! Not wourth even renting."
4,Sheridan Strikes Again,"Yes the movie is extremely silly and outlandish...but that's the point. I thought this movie was hilarious and laughed out loud many times watching it. It is definately not everyone's cup of tea as one must possess a sense of humor to appreciate comedy. Dave Sheridan was awesome as Doofy in Scary Movie, and he's great in this too. Frank McKlusky C.I. is basically a coming of age story about a man who leads a freakishly sheltered life. His partner (he's an insurance claims adjuster) is murdered and the cops think it's suicide. It's up to Frank to get to the bottom of the case, and in doing so he changes his life for the better. Co-stars include Dolly Parton, and Andy Richter, with cameos by many notable stars. The movie has a bit of Cabin Boy flavor. Definately one for the collection."
1,Stupid Stupid Movie,Was not worth the money or the time to watch it. I only bought it as Dolly Parton was in it.
5,Revelation,"This book is exquisite in that, it provides absolutely stunning close ups of the painting. The quality of every photo is unmatched in art books I have seen."
4,Great for Solos,"I only recommend this book if you're an expert guitarist who wants note-for-note solo transcriptions. There are MANY other books of Metallica music here at Amazon, mainly ""Metallica Riff by Riff"" which has rhythm tabs and music for EVERY song. If you want solos, buy this. If you're just starting out or just want rhythm, buy Riff by Riff."
2,Small Minds,"This album was a recent purchase thinking it would contain the same cleverness that my other two Lizard albums are filled with. Sadly it does not, so what you are stuck with are some mediocre songs without much of the classic punchlines I had come to expect from this group. I would suggest ""Employee of the Month"" or ""Never an Adult Moment"" over this album. On ""Employee"" I don't see how you could listen to ""Last Words"" or ""The Other Shore"" without bustin' out with a big ol' grin. Skip this one unless you are just a huge fan."
1,Literature for Space Cadets,"Trendy, vacuous, self-consciously eccentric drivel with a flaky prose style injected now and then with a four-letter word or lewd act to lend some much-needed grit and sex appeal. (An example of one of Bender's verbal gems: ""His skin felt like skin."" I'd have to go back to grade school to find tautologies this perfect.)There's a line in one of these highly forgettable, wafer-thin stories that perfectly describes the author's effect: ""Bland is a state of mind."" It's a state of mind that, apparently, many readers have confused for depth. There's so little real matter or true originality here that the effect is like watching a pet perform tricks for its bored master. Bender doesn't create characters but floating shells of people, whose outward deformities are their sole defining characteristic. The author doesn't appear to have spent one minute in the real world. Why do people like this junk?"
2,junk,"There were two stories worth reading in this collection. Most of the others are filler and seem thrown together to create a ""book""."
4,Bender On Fire,"Aimee Bender's, The Girl in the Flammable Skirt, is successful at being humorously witty and profound at the same time. Her ""messages"" surprise the unexpecting reader in a sort of sneak attack. The frequent sexual content made me laugh, while giving me simultaneous feelings of embarrassment that that my English teacher read the same explicitness. Bender's continuously imaginative themes made me jealous that I hadn't thought of them first. The story Fugue, in particular, intersects the lives of a lonely house wife, a theive-ish pill factory worker, and problematic roomates in an unusual twist of fate. The unique numbered paragraph structure along with the unique theme itself was highly entertaining. My only complaint of The Girl in the Flammmable Skirt would be that some of the stories left me unsatisfied- hungry for a more complete ending or explanation to the plot. Overall, the book is extremely compelling, what I see as the epitome of contemporary short fiction."
1,Quirky...,I'm not sure what all the fuss is about. The characters are flat and the stories seem pointless. Can quirkiness carry an entire collection? Is this what's out there for young writers?
2,Tries to be creative,"... but that's what it comes out looking like. It is tempting to view Bender's randomness as ""creativity"", but in my opinion it is really just randomness. She could have conceived of her stories by listing a lot of possible subthemes like ""de-evolving"", ""waltzing"", ""following someone"", and then rolling some dice and following instructions. I didn't see any compelling reason why any of these stories should have been written. I think Bender is overrated."
2,I thought it was sexy and maybe a little freaky,If you find out anymore books like this you should tell them not to write them I saw my little sister reading this she thought it was poetry why don't you say what it is and have it in that topic area not good for children. Especially under the age of 15. This book is too graphic for children.
1,One of the worst this literature major has ever read!,"I read the book for a class in modern american short story. As a graduating senior, I was appalled at the writing,(too simplistic), and the subject matter was assuredly pushing the envelope. She makes the reader's reach for the meanings and the subjects. In today's society, art is testing the limits, but this so called work of art by Bender is not only pushing the envelope, it is burning it. She seems to have incestuous as well as homo erotic writings mixed in with ideas and stories that do not flow together. There is no rhyme or reason and the concept that a girl could think her ""passions"" had flamed when she was being burned to a crisp by the flames from vanilla scented candles is ridiculous. The character are detached from each other as well as from their own selves. She is charateristically testing to see how far she can go as a writer and I have yet to determine what her ""shock value"" is."
5,AIMEE-I LOVE YOUR WORK--NO ONE COMPARES-YOU RULE!,1.Mark my words...someone will make a movie out of this book someday. 2.The person who reads this and acts on the above (by stealing my idea) will think he/she is a genius. 3.Aimee Bender is THE MOST IMAGINATIVE and UNDERRATED WRITER IN THE US TODAY. This woman deserves more ink....Note to Aimee: fire your publicist...you deserve better...you out Dharma Dharma...you are Seinfeld's entire writing team in one...you rule girl! We want more from you soon!
2,talent with too many hands on it.,"the author has talent, problem seems to be that instead of developing that talent herself, she has let others ""show"" her how to write. i swear, 90% of todays young authors have writing programs written all over their voices. the result of this writers school syndrome is that almost everyone seems to be turning out PRODUCT instead of actual writing. please, all you talented wordsmiths out there, stay away from other writers and professors who think they can help your writing. they cannot help it, they can only smother it. Tolsoy? Turgenev? Mark Twain? do you think any of these masters took a course in writing? here's hoping talented people like aimee bender forget what they've been told about writing and start listening to themselves alone."

5,"Original, surreal, imaginative--not for the TV zombie","These stories remind me of Francesca Lia Block, but even more surreal. I read the book in one evening. Many times I came away puzzled, or turning the page for the rest of the story, but it is so refreshing in these days of computers and Canned TV, ads and radio to find someone with true Imagination that I have to give her 5 stars. I read ""the Healing"" in Story Magazine, and had to go find more of Aimee. I don't think the stories are necessarily deep. Existential--maybe. Poetry, yes--if poetry is a love affair with words. I'd rate her as a wonderful writer. Wish I had that talent."
2,"Never quite ignites: slick, manufactured fiction.","A review from Salon Books: ""...sometimes you can practically hear Bender straining to set up dramatic catalysts for her characters' epiphanies. Reading fiction always requires some suspension of disbelief, but ... Bender seems merely to have manufactured an artificially dangerous situation for her heroine just to make her point, and it's so jarringly blatant that it throws you out of the story. It's just one example of why ""The Girl in the Flammable Skirt"" never quite ignites."""
2,A Review from TimeOut NY!,"""..When Bender attempts more ambitious pieces, such as ""Fugue,"" she fails to generate adequate momentum. Too many of the book's tales concern young women who seek out anonymous sex as a way of dealing with existential crises. In the end, The Girl in the Flammable Skirt sparks but can't ignite entirely."""
4,Surrealism at its best,"If you like surrealism, you'll like this. It's strange, cooky, but hilarious,insightful, & thought provokingHope you enjoy reading it as much as I did"
4,Lovely Surreal stories in the vein of Barry Yourgrau,"These are really entertaining surreal short stories that make me reminisce about Rene Magritte and Barry Yourgrau and other artists I admired when I was quite young. I would recommend it for parents and teachers who want to spark the interest of teenaged girls (although there is a bit of sex) and for adults who love surrealism. They are well crafted and satisfying, thoroughly enjoyable."
5,Bizarre and wonderful short-story collection!,"This has got to be one of the most bizarre short-story collections I have ever read! The stories are strange and surreal to the max. The Girl in the Flammable Skirt is full of magic realism and thought-provoking, yet disarming tales that enthralled me as much as they disturbed me. My favorite stories are ""Marzipan,"" ""Quiet Please,"" ""Skinless,"" ""Drunken Mimi,"" and ""Loser."" Aimee Bender has quite a knack for odd, unconventional stories that are unexpectedly relevant to everyday life. Bender explores the human condition in unique ways. Her style is similar to the work of an author called Amanda Filipacchi. The Girl in the Flammable Skirt is a short-story collection that I won't soon forget."
3,"Highly readable, but too gimmicky","Bender is afflicted by a syndrome affecting too many young authors: a compulsion to go over the top for no reason more apparent than being described as ""eccentrically original"" and ""outlandish"" on jacket cover reviews. Sure, the writing is wacky and audacious, but some honesty is lost amidst all this attention-grabbing weirdness. The stories kept my attention, but failed to inspire."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR,The writer is so patronizing like she is writing for remedial students. Kafka? I don't to see the similarities.
2,Eh,"While it's clear Ms. Bender can write and write cleverly, it wasn't enough to hold my attention in this quirky collection. I found myself waiting for the next oddity rather than the next revelation. And, sadly, towards the end, I was just waiting for it to all be over. I found this especially true in her novel, which was just a very very very long quirky short story. I'm a little tired of quirky and clever, so forgive me if this review is too strident. If quirky and clever is your thing, then by all means."
1,The Emporer Has No Clothes,"This little pamphlet of a book is of no consequence. After reading it I was totally indifferent to the trite, boundary-free concepts and meandering story lines that little more than provide Bender with space in which she mentally pleasures herself. The success of this book, and others like it dovetail perfectly with Adam Sandler's fame, and all the ugliness that people are encouraged to embrace in our society. ""It's like Kafka,"" I was told. Kafka would not have even coughed up his pieces of his lungs into the pages of this book of nothing."
5,Excellant storyteller,The Girl with the flammable skirt is by far the best book of short stories I've ever read. Ms. Bender has a wonderful imagination. Her characters just jump off the page. I have now read this book twice and I can promise you the image of the last story will be burned in my psyche for many years to come
1,Whateveh,"Come on...what in the, who in the, huh? How could a reader come to the conclusion that these little mind splats are stories? People listen up, if you must read this book buy it used, or borrow it. Looking to spend your money buy Flannery O'Connor."
3,Nobody's fault but my own.,"You treated the story like a rusty blade. A throw away from an open grave. Cut you loose from a chain gang. And let you go. And on the day you said it was true, some love holds, some gets used. Tried to tell you I never knew. It could be so sweet. La dee doe dee doe. Mutated but I lived and am alive forever."
4,Fun over the top murder mystery,"Crippen by John Boyne is a great fun read. It's based on the actual murder of Cora Crippen by her husband Dr. Hawley Harvey Crippen in London in 1910 and the subsequent manhunt for him. Boyne has taken the core elements to the crime and fictionalized everything else, to great effect. He even manages to take a case where the outcome is known and put in an unexpected twist that will have the reader turning back the pages for clues. My one complaint with the book is that all of the characters are characters to the nth degree. They almost become caricatures. That said, Boyne does an excellent job with pacing and setting. He somehow manages to make this dastardly, gruesome crime fun to read about. Excellent writing, I look forward to more of his work."
1,A Big Disappointment,"This book is characterized by an implausible plot and poorly developed characters. The female characters are especially bad, ranging from merely unsympathetic to repulsive. Save your money and do not buy this book. Better yet, save your free time and do not read this book! If you have a hankering for English historical fiction of roughly the same era, read Arthur and George by Julian Barnes. It is excellent."
3,Cartoonish.,"On the strength of ""The Absolutist"" which I thought was excellent, I tried ""Crippen"", which disappointed. The author plays fast and loose with far too much of the actuality. It's much more than filling in his own blanks, but taking facts from the real story and turning them into something different. I know that the work was intended as a novel but it didn't add to the story for me.As a number of other commentators has alluded, the female characters are reduced to cartoonish negative stereotypes at an almost misogynistic level.The homoeroticism of The Absolutist is well present in this earlier work also, to the extent that I was never sure who was going to be found in the closet next. I'm not sure I dare read ""The Bounty"" now. :)I found Erik Larsen's ""Thunderstruck"" a much more compelling telling of the Crippen story."
2,A famous true crime story poorly fictionalized,"I know the Crippen case very well. I have read several true crime historical accounts of it and very much enjoyed the recent book Thunderstruck the Crippen and Marconi stories. The author here attempts to fictionalise the story and I have no quarrel with that but he has failed. The female characters, especially, Mrs. Smythson, the Drakes, and Cora Crippen are cardboard stereotypes.It's a period story with precious little period detail. In 1912, no policeman would have used the expression ""media circus.""The author's ""twist on the story"" is plausible and may be the most interesting thing about this generally exasperating effort."
2,not so good,"I was unable to finish this book due to the fact that the plot was plodding and predictable. (after getting about halfway through I decided to read the last 5 or so pages.) There were no likable characters or relationships. Overall, I was bored."
1,How did this guy ever win a literary prize?,"On the basis of my interest in English murder mysteries, and because the Crippen case is a notorious one that is referenced often but that I've been unfamiliar with, I purchased this book. I'd hoped to learn about the case.What I have learned so far, is that far from being a page turner, the book is a tiresome read. The fictionalization is more worthy of a poorly written romance novel than what one would assume would be a thriller. The characters are such unbelievable cliches (the Captain Bligh loving ship's captain especially) that it's difficult to relate to any of them.I cannot recommend this book to anyone with more than half a brain."
2,disappointing,"If you're going to write a historical novel that deals with snobbery and class relations in England, you really need to have some idea of how upper-class people talked and behaved. (Hint: They don't act like the snotty rich kids in a John Hughes teen movie from the 1980s.) Also, if you're going to be a professional writer at all, a firm grasp of basic grammar is also a must. This book has more hanging modifers than a Christmas tree has dangling ornaments."
5,Great Program,I have heard about half of this program so far. I really like it. I would like to see more programs like this - possibly some that come in a DVD format. I wonder if the author of this program has a forum.
5,A retro miracle,"It's not often that a group gells exquisitely on every track; but Equation manages that and more; the singing is haunting, soft and unforgettable; the backup spare, clean and inventive; the mixes perfection; the lyrics evocative and sweetly ambiguous -- there is a melancholy like that of a candle in the room of a dying poet; and, equally rare, the album digs in deeper with repeated listenings. Songs such as ""Communion"" almost transcend the genre (folk/rock/what?), leaving behind an ache that is close to unbearable; get this album; break your heart; rediscover that almost Autumn-like wrench of lives slipping out of recognition and into something like holy love. Wow!"
5,The best find this year,I heard this CD while shopping in a bookstore. I bought it that night and have not stopped listening to it!
5,Helping grief,"I purchased this for my sister who lost her husband suddenly. She reads this over and over, likes the translation of the Scripture accompanying comforting images. After she received it she wanted copies of all in the series which I have also purchased and given to her."
1,When the viewer is the victim,"Accident on Hill Road is supposedly based on a true story, and should have been remotely interesting. Celina Jaitley is a nurse who has recently received a job with the Red Cross and is scheduled to go on a visa interview soon. She celebrates her success by partying hard with her friends one night. On the way back she accidentally hits a pedestrian played by Farrooque Sheikh. Instead of reporting to the police, the panicked Celina drives the victim, now lodged in her windshield back to her house. The rest of the movie deals with her predicament and the victims anguish.Plenty of raw stock has been wasted as the movie is as cheesy as it sounds. Faroque Sheikh, used to be a certain actor of merit but I give forgive him for doing this movie as I would like to believe that he was doing this as a favor for a friend. The rest of the cast and the direction just falter from the word go.....Accident waiting to happen and I was the unfortunate victim. One star. 11/24/10"
4,pretty but big,"this is a nice ankh if you don't want a big one this one is not for you,however the silver is pretty and a good weight,it is not double sided.The chain is to thin for a big cross like this.having said all of this it is worth the money and it look good."
3,"Nice piece, but too large","I received this product as a gift from my Wish List. The piece is beautiful. The detailing is really nice. But the piece is quite big and is much too large to be a necklace charm. We had to return the piece. However, I would purchase from this seller again, but will be sure to check the dimensions of the piece before purchasing."
4,A Chipmunk Celebration Review,This video is not as funny as other Alvin and the Chipmunks videos but it is still entertaining. The chipmunks did a fabulous job as always and they were very cute to see.
5,Its tom watts need i say more!,Great album. Got it in record time.:-) great place yo buy. Very reasonable prices and just got to say it was in amazing shape.
3,"Uhhh, what's going on here. . . ?","I LOVE the old Tom Waits. Heart Attack and Vine, Heart of Saturday Night, Blue Valentine, Closing Time, Nighthawks at the Diner -- you get the picture. Don't get me wrong, I've known lots of folks who think Swordfish Trombones and Big Time and that part of his work is great. I respect their opinions and wish I could get into this stuff, but it just doesn't work for me. The Waits stuff I love, I love as much as any other music in the world. His artistry is unmatched. Ah, well. I'm glad he's going where his vision takes him. Just wish it was a place I wanted to follow. . . ."
1,THESE ARE EARLY 1950s RECORDINGS,"This is not the adult Petula Clark singing voice. This is a young girl in England singing before she became an international superstar with a sexy voice. This is only for true collectors. It is not the familiar ""Downtown"" voice of Petula Clark known to Americans and fans worldwide."
4,Loved this read,This book suited my (DOEACC A LEVEL) course thoroughly and I raced through it as it was simple to read. I dont recall if I encountered a lot of errors but it is not likely as textbook errors piss me off like nothing else
4,Refreshing!!!,"A very refreshing look at the hardships of love ""runaways"". This movie is so real and fun to watch with girlfriends or with a date.The characters were believeable and the acting was not overdone.I really appreciate the Swansons taking the time to depict a love story without the stereotypical overly obscene thugish potrayals. Very refreshing. I will add it to my collection.I wish there was a sound track I cannot find one anywhere!!!"
4,Wonderful...,"This is a wonderful story that was intelligent, humorous, well-acted and not typical of most african-american love stories. The characters were likable and the music was terrific. I love a good movie, especially a good movie with african-americans acting with class. Unfortunately there aren't good films being made and so this one was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommend this one."
5,Black Romance,"I am a romantic so this movie tugged at my heart. I caught it on the STARZ channel and loved it. I put this movie in the category with Pretty Woman and The Notebook. Love against the odds. And the music in this movie is wonderful, I would love to have the soundtrack if there is one."
4,Heart Strings Flick,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought that this was great because of the music that supported the story line of the film. This was the first movie that I saw in long time that left what happened to the couple romantically after the movie was over was left up to the viewer. This movie showed the talent of Mr. Brooks who has such an amazing voice. I think that the chemistry between them was good. This movie inspires the single woman to not give up because Mr. Right may be Mr. Wrong's brother. HA HA HA!
4,All About You- A MUST SEE!,"I have loved Terron Brooks ever since I saw him in the Temptations mini series and I have the DVD to that as well. Terron is a good actor and singer and I hope he will do more movies. He usually does a lot of ""Broadway"". I have been a fan of Renee Goldsberry since she began appearing on the soap opera ""One Life to Live"". I can't say enough about these two actors. Their onscreen chemistry is brilliant! It makes you wish they were a couple in real life. I also purchased the soundtrack and I listen to it often. I do feel the deleted scene ""one year later"" should have actually been in the movie itself, however, I still congratulate the husband and wife team of Christine and Michael Swanson who wrote and produced the movie on a job well done."
5,Get it today!,"Man! I loved this movie. I have had this movie for about a month and I've watched it at least 10 times - maybe more. This is like the black version of ""When Harry Met Sally"" - only better. A struggling, but extremely talented singer and a misguided law school dropout become roommates. But the catch is the singer, Terron Brooks, is the brother of the former law student's (Rene' Goldsberry) ex-boyfriend. These two characters find out that they have more in common than they think, and in the meantime fall in love with each other.If you like love stories, and you are hungry to see black people portrayed in a way that is hardly ever seen on film, you will love this movie. Brooks' and Goldsberry's performances are fresh and witty. And the music is off the chain!"
5,Help I want the Soundtrack,Great Movie and in dying need of finding the sound track. Please help. email me at tanrn1@hotmail.com
1,All About You,"I received the DVD, it was unviewable. I returned it and was refunded the full amount of the purchase, minus my return shipment fee. So it cost me to return it, it cost my credit card interest and still I was not able to see the movie. I'd suggest that any sellar be certain the product they sell is usable."
2,"Can we say ""Poor excuse for a low budget film""?","I mean come on it was cute, but how was the football star just going to let her take his car, and she in turns goes joy riding with another dude?"
1,Elementary,"I borrowed the movie from a friend and laughed through half of it. The actors reminded me of people desperate for a lil work and would do anything to be seen. It was stupid and the leading actress, I forget what her name was should concentrate on being In ""The Color Purple and ""One Life To Live""! The rest of the cast isn't worth mentioning! Find a local bonfire and throw it in people!"
1,THIS MOVIES SUCKS!,"I was craving a good romantic movie in the African-American genre, so I searched and found that this movie had great reviews. Being that I live in a predominantly white area, the movie was unavailable to rent. So, I purchased it from Best Buy for $9.99 with serious regret. I fell asleep three or four times, and when I was awake, I was sick with boredom. It was slow, boring, stupid and awful. I'd bet money that all of the reviewers that gave this more than 1 star are actually actors in the movie. There is NO WAY that anyone with any sense of what a good movie is made of would rate this any higher. I'm appauled that all of the quality actors and actresses staring in this film stooped so low to act in such a low-budget movie. No wonder no one has ever heard of it or that it was never a feature film. YUCCCKKKKKK!"
5,It's About Time!!!!,"AMEN! Finally!! A black movie where it's not dominated by cursing, half-naked women and violence. It's a movie that you can watch without worrying about the typical black movies. I really give props to the makers of this movie. It's romantic and it has talented actors and actresses. Great story line. This movie was shot in 28 days!!!! What talent!! I am buying this movie! You sould too!"
3,It was good...but,This was a good movie. The script was well written. The actors were great. The movie left some unresolved issues between Robbie and Brian. Did they resolve their issues? Did Brian resolve the issues with the rest of his family? This is a movie definitely worth viewing.
1,Ripoff,"I love this movie,that's why I purchased it, however I've tried to play it in several DVD players and it will NOT play. It's not worth the hassle of returning the DVD because I'll only get half of my purchase price back and it will cost more to return it than what I paid for it...love the movie, not too happy with Amazon!"
5,All About You,"I love, love, love this movie... Romance at it's best... higly recommended to all Terron Brooks fans!"
2,For Completists Only?,"The Lounge Lizards are not the best live band. They stand out for their clever songs, which, honestly, are much better presented in a studio setting, where the average picking and okay singing can be put in their best light. If you are new to this band, spend your money on one of their excellent studio albums."
4,a vulcan's eye view of glibc,"This is a great book on glibc.I find the bound version a little pricy though,so instead I downloaded the printable for free from gnu's website.I don't knwo why gnupress insists on charging so much for this book in the printed form, or otherwise this would be the first on my list to buy.packed with examples, details of implementation and many pointers on what or what not to do with certain function calls.great for learning some networking basics as well, without having to pour over the humungous Richard Stevens volumes.very packed, very technical, no wasting of words."
5,WOW!! Great bang for the buck,"This projector is fantastic. I wasn't sure about the Acer name for projectors, but the picture blows me away. I previously owned a XGA BenQ PB6200. It didn't have an HDMI input, so I had to use the VGA to component adapter for HD content. Using the HDMI, this picture is so much clearer. The colors and the sharpness are amazing. It doesn't have a lot of lumens, so it is better for darker rooms. I recommend this for any home enthusiast. It is much better than a XGA projector in the comparable price range."
4,Brand New 3 level hamster cage,"I researched alot of Hamster cages before finally selecting this one. My daughter absoluetly loves this cage for her Panda Bear hamster. Although the base was slighly cracked when it arrived,I was still pleased with the quality of the product. It has plenty of room and the little hamster house is so adorable! We bought another wheel though,because the one that comes with the cage is rather cheap. My only suggestion is to package the cage better so that the plastic base won't be easily cracked during transit!"
2,"Recieved it, but items either broke within two days....","I ordered this cage originally for a rat and then recieved it. I realized it was too small and originally was going to mail it back, but I kept it and got 4 mice instead, where there is plenty of room for them. The next day however, one of the little attachments to the house that came with it broke off when I was washing it (gently), and the day after that I tried to get them some water and then when I went to put the bottle that came with the product back on, the attachment to keep the bottle up completely broke off. Not worth the $40 I paid for it, too many cheap parts. I've since then replaced everything but the bars and the bottom of the cage. I would not recommend this to anyone."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"Our gerbils chew through anything and everything. After hours and hours of searching for a gerbil-friendly cage that was also made completely of metal, I finally found this one. It could not be more perfect for them and they love the little house that came with it. Surprisingly enough, they haven't taken to chewing it up...yet. I think this cage will last a good while before we need to get another one."
5,Everything,"Got everything. I really don't need another book, though I have Krantz's ""Jobs Rated Almanac"" which also has some good attributes. I also use the Job Finder as a reference since it has so much about so many companies."
4,Honey Loquat,"Although the mixture is not as thick as it used to be, I still find that it works very well - and the children LOVE it! There needs to be some kind of special discount for quantities of 4 and over."
5,Ideal Pilates video,"I second the comments made by the other reviewer, ""Melanie"". This is a perfect Pilates video in every way: flow, instruction, setting, lighting and music. It couldn't be better!"
5,The impossible has occurred: I enjoy exercising!,"I can add little to the warm words of the other reviewers; I just wanted to highlight that, not only is the video beautifully executed and effective, the exercises themselves are a joy to do. I actually enjoy exercising almost daily with this tape!"
4,Decent for Mid-Range Readings,"I got this to test my pH while setting up a freshwater tank. Where I live, the water is quite hard, so I knew some adjustments would be needed. This is a very simple to use kit and the laminated card that tells you the explanation of the test result colors is great. However, because it only goes up to 7.5, I had to do a lot of guesswork to get my tank down to those levels. The color stays the same until the pH falls down to the levels this kit is designed for - not a design flaw at all, but it isn't the most effective kit when you live in a hard water area. I suspect the same would be the case if you live somewhere with very soft water, too."
4,I wish the color was a bit easier to read,It does it's job but wish the color indicator was a bit more easier to read because it is hard to tell between 6.3 to 6.8
3,No Charger Base,"I have not tried this item since I will be returning it. It does not have a charger base as is states in the description, although it does have a storage base. I had hoped that it had rechargable batteries. Although it does look like it is a quality item so I will not rate it too low - it is just a bad description that is dissappointing."
4,"Criticism of the poem ""the listeners""","In page 252 the author of the book starts to critized ""The Listeners"" , those are the pages that I'm the most interested in. I don't remeber exactly what it talks about that's why I'm interested in reviewing the book."
2,This book is not for the newbee,"I got this book based on other reviews. However after going thru the Zen of Illustrator (which I found helpful), I found this book was more for the seasoned veteran and or graphic designer that had a good understanding of AI and needed ideas to hone his or her skills. I'll put this book on my shelf until I get better but I cannot recommend this book for anyone just getting started."
3,It's Allright.,It's only worth getting if you've never had a Illustrator WOW book. I was pissed to see that probably half of the demonstrations were the exact same as my Illus. 9 WOW book. You would think they would come up with a new book everytime....NOPE! Some of the walk-throughs wetre very good but don't buy it if you allready have a WOW book.
1,HP is GREEDY,"I have the HP d145 which cost close to $500. It is used mainly as a fax, but does print nice photos. However HP 14 cartridges have an expiration date which renders the whole machine USELESS until the overpriced ink is replaced. WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS STILL INK IN THE CARTRIDGE. I DONT PRINT ALOT OF PHOTOS and HP penalizes the consumer over lack of use. I understand the print heafds can be damaged if allowed to dry. I would prefer breaking my property on my own than HAVE IT NOT WORK ANYWAYS when there is PLENTY of ink still usable. NOT EVEN BLACK ONLY PRINTING WILL WORK IF THE COLOR SAYS EXPIRED! AND HP SAYS 4.5 YRS to Expiration. THAT IS A BUNCH OF HOOEY! Some also prefer to refill with EVEN BETTER ink which is their RIGHT since it is THEIR PROPERTY, But HP seems to think it is entitled to FORCE consumers to BUY MORE INK on their schedule , not the consumers. I will NEVER own another HP product again..SHAME on YOU HP!"
4,A good history of the 56th FG in WWII,"The author has done a good job of providing a very detailed account of the flying/fighting history of the 56th FG in WWII. This book is loaded with actual combat accounts from the pilots and general discriptions of daily sorties...actually, that's primarily all the book is. If you're looking for something on Zemke himself, this probably isn't the book for you. The author takes a more general approach, detailing each kill of this historical fighter group and never really concentrating on any one pilot to any substantive degree. The author also provides a detailed Appendix with, among other things, a complete breakdown of the kills of the 56th (including planes destroyed, buy who, and on what day). Thus it serves as both a good ""read"" generally as well as a handy reference source. The only complaint I have with the book is that the writing is somewhat cumbersome in that it reads like a reference manual at times."
4,The DVD is clear and worth the cost.,"The interview done by Mike Wallace with Rod Sterling in 1959 is worth the value of the DVD. The stories are classic, and well done. Anyone who liked the 1960's series, will love this DVD."
3,So-so overall,"""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge"" is really good - but it wasn't even a TZ derived show. It won an Oscar and other awards as a French short film, however. During the Civil War, a man is sentenced to death by hanging and has a nice fantasy on the way down.""The Encounter"" between hate-filled Marine versus repressed Japanese-American apparently was never in the re-run loop. Rather bad acting and somewhat silly premise. Only interesting for George Takei (""Sulu"" from Star Trek).""Where Is Everybody?"" asks Earl Holliman. Possibly interesting premise but his continuous talking out loud gets tedious. Kinda lame ending.DVD includes a short ""pitch"" film to be shown to advertisers, and a nice 1959 interview with Mike Wallace which might be the actual treasure."
3,Incomplete :-(,"I have not bought this DVD even though I have all of The Twilight Zone on VHS and should replace them. This disc and it's sequel ""More Treasures of The Twilight Zone"" contain the entire contents that were originally released as a 2 VHS tape set. For the first time a transition from tape to disc was made incomplete. This to me insults my intelligence, even though the only 2 episodes not currently available in syndication are on this first disc. If someone re-releases this disc and it's sequel together for equal to or less than you can buy the taped copy. I will consider making the purchase. Until then for the first time, the DVD has hurt me. :-("
4,Offical Game Guide,This guide is great its full of info about the game a must have if you want to be a good player.
3,Not a bad book. Translation - poor.,"The problem with this book and many others published by Schiffer is not the books themselves but their translations from German into English. It is, to say the least, poor. I advise you to avoid Schiffer books translated by Joseph Welsh, as this one."
1,A Big Disappointment,"Having read Kurowski's ""Infanterie Aces"" and ""Panzer Aces"", I was expecting this book to be action-packed and filled with first-hand personal accounts of fighting from the German side. I was severely disappointed as this is not the Kurowski I know. It was overall not a readable book even for the lack of battle action. I would not recommend this book to anyone. But I do highly recommend Kurowski's other books that I have mentioned."
4,Hitler's Last Bastion by Franz Kurowski,"This book is definately worth the cost, if you want to learn of the final battles of Hitler's third reich, get this book. I am an avid reader of books dealing with the German military in WWII and this is one of my favorites. Very informative."
1,Inaccurate --- Whose Perspective??,"I began reading this book from the perspective of someone whose family was one of the many thousand Ost Deutsche fleeing the advancing Soviet army, and there is virtually ZERO written in English about the fall of Koenigsberg and East Prussia. In the photo sections highlighting these battles, the author shows a photo of the center of old Koenigsberg after the 3 day fire bombing raid in August 1944 -- and juxtaposes this with the ruins of the University saying this was after Russian bombing. This raid on the historic center was by the British, and in similar form to Dresden. Get it right!"
5,Amazing,"I haven't heard this album. Rather, I saw them live at a show. The duo was a meld of intensity, energy, and downright eccentricity. The music was phenomenal (especially Peace of Mind). I walked away from the show thinking ""that was amazing"" I tried finding them online, at other shows, and what have you but to know avail. That was four years ago. I still remember the name and just glanced over it while browsing. An amazing band for anyone who likes indie rock."
3,Well...,"I saw them last night open up for IMA ROBOT. The music was very cool, the drum, synth, guitar loops were very cool, but the vocals killed it. The lyrics that I could actually make out were awful so I was quite glad I couldn't hear them. But the music itself was quite unique."
2,Nina's Secret,"This is not a great legal thriller, but it won't insult your intelligence, either. The characters and their dialogue are the weaker points of this fiction, but working your mind trying to figure who the killer is overshawdows the shortcomings. Our Criminal Justice System would be more effective with judges such as the Honorable Judge Milne on the bench - You will delight seeing him work from the Bench. Nina is very competant in the courtroom; But just wait for a VERY rainy day before delving into this novel."
2,Not very exciting,"This book has its moments, but they are few and really far between. I did not find the characters believable and I certainly didn't learn to care about them and what happened to them. The court room segment was well done, and that is why I gave the book two stars rather than one, but personally I don't think John Grisham has a concern with these ladies taking any of his readership away."
