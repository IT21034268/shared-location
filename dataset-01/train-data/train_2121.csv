3,Useful for intermediate and advanced users,"Beginning COM programmers will find it very difficult to follow. This is currently the most authoritative book on the subject. Unfortunately, the book is excruciating to read - the jargon will make you dizzy. There are no tutorials and few complete examples. Mr. Box knows the subject well and covers the material very thoroughly."
3,"The author is a COM master, but at times that is a problem.","Obviously, Don Box is a COM and C++ master, which is where the problem lies. Admittedly, he does cover many aspects of COM quite extensively. The first chapter is the best background material on COM that I have read. But thereafter, Box changes his approach. He then seems to lapse into gratuitous, uncontollable programming razzle-dazzle when covering COM topics. His multi-page macros are just plain confusing and distracting. [Who is his intended audience: COM neophytes or his COM cronies?] His explanations concerning his use of the subtleties of C++ are entirely too feeble. While COM is at heart a subtle C++ application, surely programming virtuosity can be de-emphasized when explaining COM basics. His examples have questionable utility. However, again, his book does fill in some of the gaps of COM that other books gloss over. But I'm still waiting for that five-star book on COM."
3,Interesting and exciting,"after reading this book (it was not easy) I was amazed how this book is perceived by other readers. Reading the reviews one has a feeling the reviewer would rather say something different but feels obliged to acknowledge the greatness of the author. ""The author is a COM guru therefore this is a bible"". Is this a phenomena of emperor's new clothes? This book presents a comprehensive review of COM as seen from the top, and is valuable to developers already familiar with COM. The style of this book is interesting, I personally would prefer a simple prose."
2,Intellectual Self-Indulgence,"This book starts out by saying that it would cover COM at its most basic, no class libraries or macros to get in your way. That sounded like an absolutely wonderful idea.But what happened was that instead of explaining how the real world ATL COM macros worked, Don Box spent the entire book explaining how his own personal macros worked. That was not what I signed up for.Did I learn something? Yes, but I sure had to wade through a lot of Don Box's macros to see how COM worked."
2,"boring, just read chapter 1 and look for another one.","It takes me 3 years to finish this book, only first chapter is very good;Man! a real book writer, where do you find all these words to explain very simple idea;I read the first chapter 3 years aga, and I can't continue it, every time I was sleeping;If you need one COM book, don't buy this one;"
3,no source code,"I read Essential COM almost 10 years ago, and revisited it recently, out of curiosity. It's tough sledding, but if you *must* know this stuff, this is probably it.However, throughout the book the phrase ""the source code that accompanies this book"" occurs repeatedly. As far as I could ascertain after an hour or so of googling and searching, there *is* no such source. I assume it stopped working 5 years ago or something, and rather than continuing to provide it somewhere on the web with a disclaimer -- which I assume would be embarrassing to Mr. Box -- it has been silently ""disappeared"". I consider this mildly unethical, and certainly annoying, since many perhaps minor points are supposedly demonstrated by this non-existent source."
4,A Must Read,One of the best COM books i have read. The way Don Box leads to COM concepts in the first chapter is the best. Not for programmers who do not know C++
3,This Book Is Not for The Weak At Heart!,"If you are under pressure and have a development project with an impossible deadline... and you need to learn COM, this is not the one for you. You need prayers, in that case. If, however, you have just a little bit of time to decipher the intricate isms and schizms concerning Ape and Gorilla classes as they relate to the Component Object Model, there can be no better book. This is one of those books that is clearly for the geese, and not the gander. But mastering the pattern of thought of this strange fellow might well become a rite-of-passage into the battlefield of COMology."
3,Not a good book to start COM,"If you want to learn COM I dont think this book is a good start. It is a great book and I think every COM developer should read it, however; it is not a step-by-step into. It also doesn't have small projects which let's your get feet wet w/COM. I would recommend ""Inside COM"" by Dale Rogerson to start learning COM."
4,COM Explained in Detail,This book explains COM in such detail that it is essential for anybody who wishes to consider themselves experts in this technology.
4,Rewarding!! Keep practicing!!,"Terrific idea, although the instructor is (at first) hard to follow. Try it out when you're not too tired and keep practicing--you'll find you can do these routines--and they are fun!!! I dont do gym routines on a regular basis, so these were tough for me at first, but I kept at it. It;s the only momma & baby routine I've found that works. Plus, my baby actually goes to sleep after we do the warm-up and dance #1 (or sometimes after these and a second round of dance #1). No joke--we all win."
1,Disappointed - not fun as I hoped,"I was disappointed in this video. Having read other reviews, and the advertisements I thought this would be really fun. I have not been able to make it through the entire video. All of the ""dances"" seemed to be the same, only minor variations. I never felt like I was dancing, just trying to move my feet to follow the women on the screen, who also didn't seem to be dancing. I could not get my hips to follow the instructor, and she gave very little help other than which direction to move your feet. The rocking movement may be soothing for the baby, but I am not going to complete a workout that is boring for me. The movements also required very little exertion. I really did not feel like I was gaining many exercise benefits.I was impressed with the way this DVD was organized. You do not have to do the entire workout. You can skip directly to any song you like. I wish more exercise DVDs were set up that way."
5,A page a day takes frustration away,"A year into owning this book, I started reading a page or two a day during breakfast before going to work. I'm not known as an angry person nor was I prone to shouting, but I knew that I sometimes speak and act from a place of anger. This book is teaching me much that has helped me in the work place and at home as well. I recently asked in a work meeting if people recognized that frustration is a form of anger. My colleagues were intrigued with this statement in a positive way and I was happy to bring Yiddishkeit into my workplace in an allowable way. Unless you're already a tzaddik, this book will surely improve your interpersonal relations."
5,Comprehensive and Well written Guide for all things Catholic,"If you have ever wanted a complete, easy-to-read, and practical explaination of the Catholic faith, this is the book for you.From Abandonment and Abba to Worship and Zeal it is all here in this one volume. And the most impressive feature is that each article by the more than 150 contributors does not use a bunch of secular terms which defy understanding.It also covers other major theological thought and actions so that it is suitable for those who want to learn and for those what simply want to brush up."
2,Just awful.,"OK, to be fair, it's a good performance/recording of Bach's Magnificat (that's why two stars instead of one). But I bought it to be able to listen to Vivaldi's Gloria, and that performance is just awful. The wind instruments play consistently off-key; there's one movement where I can't even tell if it's major or minor. I guess I'm naive; I didn't think performances this bad got made into commerically available recordings. I listened to clips, and assumed that they were typical of the quality on this CD; but all the clips are from the Bach Magnificat, and I had no way of knowing that Gloria would be this bad. Buy it if you're looking for a reasonably priced recording of the Magnificat and don't care about the Gloria."
4,Scooby Doo TV Game,"I bought this for my 3 year old as an intro to video games as he absolutely loves Scooby Doo. It works, he likes it and it serves the purpose for me. It is cheap, but that's great for a 3 year old to play with ... if he breaks it...big deal. For the Blonde and Brunette reviewers who claim the controls are all backwards ... TURN IT AROUND!!! DOH!! The wire goes towards the TV ... not the front of the Mystery Machine;^)"
4,Awesome Shopping Experience,"I ordered this for my dad (yes, my dad - he's over 60) after he saw the one my kids have. Very easy to order, I paid a couple of dollars extra for expedited shipping (the price was still lower, including the extra shipping, than any other place I found) and the game arrived a day before the estimated arrival date. It got here so fast, that I was not able to track my order - the website still said that it was preparing to ship right up to the day I actually got it. Overall, an awesome shopping experience."
4,Rhythm and Rock,This cd is reissuing titles from a lp out inI believe in the 80's with added stuff. Local artists from the Bay Area some played on the local stations. Some excellent sides.
1,poor stuff,"All the infos are dated and in some cases completely wrong , all the pix are downloaded from internet so there is not nothing new or cool to be known , do not buy this book , period ."
5,Very informative,describes how to paint many different kinds of flowers. There are a couple craft ideas in there to. I can't wait to get started on the fountain.
4,"Tole Painted Outdoor Projects: Decorative Designs for the Garden, Patios,Decks and More",The book is one of several painting books I have ordered from Amazon. I am pleased with the books condition and cost of my purchase.It has basic tole painting instructions and several creatice outdoor projects. One will like the presentation of project pictures also.. One can take the authors ideas and use in their own creatice painting projects. I also was impressed how it was shipped so it would arrive in excellent condition. I would recimmend this purchase to add to your painting books and happy to add it to mine.
4,Cute!,i loved the costume it's really cute! i was worried it wasnt going to fit but it did :] i love it
5,Nice,I wore this costume for our Halloween party at my place of employment and had many compliments. It was nice and inexpensive.
5,Review of Mormon Tabernacle Choir's Greatest Hits,The CD was received within the alloted time and was in excellent condition. I highly recommend the album to anyone who is interested in their music.
5,God Inspiring Music,This Recording is absolutely God given talent. I am interested in gaining copies of the sheetmusic if it is available. Pleas advise. My admiration to Mr Richard Condie.
5,Mormon Tabernacle Choir,Exactly what I expexted. My wife was pleased. Great CD with good variety of music. Ordered CD since our vehicles have only CD players.
3,Plethora of information!,"This work was a lifesaver! Stoessinger presents important information that I was unable to find in any other book located in the local university library. This book, which is used by many universities as a text book was extremely useful in my research studies of American foreign relations with China and Russia. Stoessinger I thank you!"
5,"""Great"" sums it up","This set had all of the songs that I wanted, and some that I didn't even realize were Lionel (I'm younger than quite a few of the songs :D). With 2 cds and and a dvd, this is the best collection that I've found. It's well worth the price to avoid buying several cds to get the same list of songs. You know the songs you want to hear, so I won't even go into that, but the way that this set is done is great.I would definitely recommend this version (over the domestic Collection)."
4,Great book for ASP developers trying to learn ASP.NET,"Excellent book again from the Wrox team. A few of the examples do not work and there are typos but this book should rank way above the rest of the books on ASP.NETThis book is far more comprehensive than the ""Preview of ASP+"" that was released a few months ago.I liked the chapter about web services and securing ASP.NET applications."
2,The ASP gods have stumbled,"I read Pro ASP 3 and thought it was a rare model of excellence for computer books. Pro ASP.NET does not come anywhere close to that. This book is painfully unorganized and full of holes. Granted ASP.NET is utterly different than old ASP but I got the feeling that the authors did not totally understand the subject themselves. There is some very good information here but it is not in a format that allows you to quickly get up to speed. Unlike previous books this one is not even a good reference. The authors are good, I hope they try again soon and get it right. Anyone who gave this book 5 stars or even 4 must be on the Wrox payroll."
3,Fair,"This isn't the greatest book, but it's not that bad either. There's over 1000 pages of explanations and examples. I thought in general the coverage wasn't bad. There are shortcomings in deployment, packaging and internationalization topics. Your understanding of .NET and ASP.NET will improve greatly by reading this book. Are there better books out there? By now, most likely YES. But for the time that this came out, there weren't many books covering this topic."
3,a bit rushed,"I think the content of this book is strong, but the code is buggy. A lot of the examples written have errors, such as missing tags or poor method calls. It makes me wonder if anyone actually went through the book and tried to compile the samples as typed.But given that .NET isnt even out yet, I would say WROX did an acceptable job."
4,Me ha gustado mucho,Me ha parecido estupendo. Explica con unos buenos ejemplos lo que va a ser la nueva plataforma.NET. Muy bueno.
2,Not Wrox quality,"I've relied on a certain level of quality from wrox publications in the past. This book falls far short. New concepts and terms are introduced and not explained until later. Code examples are for individual topics, which is good, but none tying several ideas together that were useful to me. No or incomplete listing of properties and methods. I had to write 2 .NET web page applications in the past week. Over 90% of the time when seeking answers I've had to use the web. I pay exorbitant prices for a book so I don't have to do that. The index is terrible, which is a must for a quick reference. I've felt pretty confident in the past just purchasing a book from wrox without previewing, not anymore. This book of course provides useful information, but suffers from poor writing, scope and sequence, and failure to anticipate and address obvious reader questions and issues."
2,"No Code-Behinds, No VS.NET, Almost Entirely in VB.NET","This is a good ASP.NET book for ""Notepad Developers"" who are migrating from VBScript to VB.NET or are learning VB.NET from scratch. There are some JScript and C# examples in the book but it is primarily VB.NET.I am using VS.NET which promotes ""code-behinds"" so this book is tougher to learn from for me. I like Wrox books but I will choose a different one (maybe from Wrox, Apress, or MSPress) to strengthen my skills with ASP.NET and VS.NET.You can count on solid content when Rob Howard is writing. Good web security stuff. I have been a fan of his since his Site Server P&M book (ISBN: 1861001940) hit the market."
2,bad bad bad,"the author simply copy all the information from the framework sdk as is, even the exaples are almost the same.the result is too much information, not arranged at all,no reasonable structure between the topics.i read the jesse liberty book about c# and in 600 pagesi learnt much more and i enjoyed.i read all the wrox proffesional series.this one is the worst."
3,Incorrect Title for book - Should be ASP.NET for VB.NET,"Most of the examples are in VB. This is very annoying. The authors admit early in the book that C# is the preferred language for use in .NET. Extremely disappointing to say the least.In spite of this, the book does contain valuable reference material and examples, however it is a struggle to continuously translate VB and is very distracting.Get with the program guys. I would gladly pay double for a C# only book."
2,First bad Wrox Book i ever bought,"This book is the worst i've seen from Wrox. I am a dedicated Wrox reader and i have to say that something went wrong in writing this one. The title of this is Professional ASP.NET and it gives you behind the scenes of .NET Framework with C# examples. It jumps from topic to topic within the same chapters. Most i've read so far, ""Explained in chapter x"". I would not get this book."
3,Not good enough,"I read most of the early Wrox titles on .NET and this book, like many of those (Public beta etc.,), are a great introduction into the various technologies. Unfortunately, there is too much errata (should you visit their site) and makes you seriously question the credibility of the prose and capability to learn the technology from their text. I have found ""Pure ASP.NET"" and ""Designing ASP.NET"" as better sources, but they were written or finalized during the Release Candidate phase. There will probably be a slew of 2nd Edition titles forth comming that will be better but if you, like me, bought several of these titles from Wrox (...dollar amount...) then this could be disconcerting encourages a more wait and see approach if you rely more on this publisher. On the other hand, being an early adopter may involve this kind of trial. In short, my review is to the huge number of errors. I copied and pasted the errors directly into Word from the website and it was 22 pages."
2,Lots of info but poorly organized,"There is a lot of information in the text, but is often disjointed, sort of stream of consciouness. Ultimately it is frustrating."
1,Rushed to Market Disappontment,"We have purchased WROX books such as Professional ASP 3 and have been generally happy with the quality. Hence we didn't hesitate to purchase this version. However having received it , we have found it a rushed poorly edited book based on the BETA version of .NET. Thes structure is poor, detail too low and many errors.I'm afraid that we would have to advise not to purchase this book."
2,dissapointment,I bought this book on the prospect of getting more information regarding the use of ASP.NET with C#. Much to my dismay i found that the vast majority of examples are in VB.NET .If you're looking for a book about ASP.NET and C# STEER CLEAR of this one ...
1,Wrox books downgraded from Strong Buy to Caution / Sell,"DON'T BUY THIS BOOK if this is the first book you are reading on ASP.NET.Even otherwise the book is very poorly organized. From now on i have decided i cannot buy a WROX book just by its reputation. There is a saying - ""Once bitten twice shy"". I have experienced this twice. Professional ASP XML was also very disjointed, the same thing was repeated by different authors in different chapters and was poorly organized. Wrox is definitely churning out books without any thought to quality. There is an exception. Professional SQL Server 2000 is excellent.Final advice - Skim through all chapters in a bookstore before buying. Wrox has lost its glory."
3,"A Fun Read, As Long As Typos Don't Bother You","This book has a lot of useful information in it. However, I have never seen a book with so many typos before. It's as if they never read it over once before sending it to the press."
1,Out of date,"Sadly to say, even though this is a newly released book, with the release of .NET beta 2, this book is already woefully out of date. The examples in the book and downloaded from the WROX simply do not work at all. So much has changed with the Beta 2 release of .NET that literally every example I have worked with does not work. This is not to say that a month ago or more, this book was a great value -- it probably was. But, today, I have found that this book is not usable. In fact, if you're learning coding syntax from this book, you'll be very surprised as to how much has already changed. Save your money and sanity and wait. After all, there's no reason to learn syntax that is no longer used."
1,Definitely not Beta 2 -- Disappionting.,"As is, most examples do not work without major tweaking -- even the most simplest of examples. Many samples do not work in Beta 2 as .NET Beta 2 does not even recognize the syntax, let alone compile. Anyone who buys and reads through this book will immediately see this. Even the simple action of building a web method has changed from Beta 1 to Beta 2 and you will get an error when trying to compile.For coders out there, in the standard WROX method, you are fed the samples in the book one line at a time without having the beginning and ending sections (i.e., not the entire code)...making it impossible to type the code manually and being able run it. WROX does offer the samples as download, but once again, the samples do not work.I personally would wait until more ASP.NET books come out on the market. Many are scheduled soon. That way, you can be sure of examples that work. Very disappointed for such an expensive book."
4,"Concise, informative, and fun","I was curious to know why Texans are obsessive about Texas and chose this book for its broad overview in the hope of finding an answer. The scope is ambitious enough to be informative without being mired in detail, and is amply illustrated. I especially like the sections at the back of the book: Chronology of Major Events, a calendar of special events, Texas in film, contact information, and more. The only thing lacking -and I really missed it! - is a good map of Texas!"
5,Amazing,"Leonard Rose is an incredible cellist, and this album really showcases his amazing talent! A must-have for any classical music library! And I have no idea what Dr. John F. Gay is talking about."
5,Indiscutiblemente solo lo mejor,"Sin duda alguna el chelistaLeonard Rose y el directorEugene Ormandy hacen unbuen trabajo de obras conocidasy otras no tan conocidas.El concierto de Lalo esinterpretado de manera formidable.Las ya conocidas variaciones deTchaikovsky, son aqui interpretadas.La rapsodia Hebrea ""Scholomo"" o ""Salomon""es aqui interpretada con la delicadezay ternura que requiere. Este disconos muestra otras obras para elviolonchelo que aun no conociamos...En este disco tenemos indiscutiblementesolo lo mejor."
1,"Superb performance, content. poor engineering cuts phrases","Excellent content and performance, but engineering cuts phrase endings thus spoiling the compositions. It makes for frustrating listening. Imagine missing the last word of spoken sentences. Most unfortunate and ruins an otherwise superb CD"
5,The way it was,"The author is a friend, and I hadn't read his book. The life of journalists in Vietnam is realistically portrayed."
2,Failed after three years,"This device saw occasional use over three years for powering a laptop and other gadgets. Ultimately, it stopped functioning consistently, with the fault light appearing more times than not. It's too bad -- I was happy with the inverter, but expected a longer lifespan."
2,Great light with a fatal design flaw,"I have owned three of these penlights. I like the weight of the penlight. It feels very sturdy. The halogen bulb is bright and the switch is easy to use. However, there is an unforgivable flaw with this product. The switch is attached to the metal body by a threaded plastic flange. Each of these has just snapped off in my hand when turning the light on. The first one was after 6 months of daily use in an optometry office. It was replaced under the warranty. The replacement did the same thing at about 9 months. I liked the light enough to buy another one, but alas 13 months later it met the same fate and is past the one year warranty. Now I have to decide if I like it enough to spend $50 on it every year, essentially. I think I will look for another option."
1,Expensive and broke after 2 months,"I got this present as a Christmas gift. I knew it was expensive but it was a gift so it was nice to have. It's a bit heavy in the pocket, but it has a sleek stylish design. The light is a halogen bulb that I think finds the right medium between a regular bulb and the very bright LED light. I was fine with the product until I dropped it from a distance of 2 feet on the floor and it ceased to work. I temporarily placed the bulb of my friend's Welch allyn pocket light on my penlight and it worked again. First, the bulb broke from a drop of 2 feet! Come on! Second when I looked for replacement bulbs they are $25! That is 4x the price of complete pen lights. I'm going to sell it to some bright eyed first year student, but simply put this thing is not durable and not worth the money."
2,rip-off,"Pros: bright, looks professionalCons: questionable build quality, dropped it once from table height and it won't turn on again. even before this happened light bulb was not aligned. I expected much more from a $50 light. It's also very heavy and weighs your pocket down. I'll be looking at another penlight for replacement."
3,Don't drop it............,"It's a great light. Except when it falls and breaks. Out another $40-$50, but I'm hooked on it. LED would be better. It's overpriced, wish I didn't feel compelled to keep buying them."
3,Great light but....,"Great light, pocket size, but almost new it fell and that its!!! The lamp go out. For the half the price of the entire unit I finaly can get a lamp replacement. Its a good penlight but, not heavy duty."
1,Defective,"I received this penlite and initially it turned on, but after turning it off then on again, it didn't work. Sent it back to the supplier over 2 weeks ago and still haven't heard whether or not my refund has been processed (or that they received the item)."
2,Looking for Mahavishnu???,"I confess up front that I'm a huge fan of the Mahavishnu Orchestra and therefore of Mahavishnu John McLaughlin. I've tried to reconnect with McLaughlin through the years and I just don't find any of his subsequent work to be of much value. Most of the music on this live CD wouldn't be out of place on a Quiet Storm type jazz radio station and, sure, that doesn't make it bad - just not what I'd hoped for. When he does try to show passion McLaughlin ends up playing scales - very fast scales certainly - but scales nevertheless. Which means he's not offering us anything that a good heavy metal guitarist couldn't give us. And I just find that sad. Excuse me, I think I'll pull out ""Birds of Fire"" one more time..."
1,Cheap garbage,"When I attempted to tighten the straps down the stitching on one side ripped. Keep in mind I worked in the auto industry for about 10 years and used to install these types of items all the time, so I know what I'm doing and was not putting an excessive amount of pressure when tightening it down.Cheaply made item and a waste of my money."
3,Let Down,"Too much politics for a fable. Don't expect to be drawn into the story like his other fable. This one takes a while to get into, and the ending is kind of a let down. I didn't expect this from the author of The Butterfly."
4,A lot bigger than it looks.,This was originally for my kitten but when it arrived I realized that wasn't going to happen. My kitten could probably sleep in the dishes. This is definitely for the full size adult cats or dogs. Just a head's up.Otherwise the build is sturdy yet light and the removable dishes make it super easy to wash. Good cost/performance!
5,loved it,The stories are captivating. This is a classic. I would suggest this to anyone. The price is right as well
5,Mendelssohn Octet Renewed!,"This version of the Mendelssohn Octet is one of the best I have heard in ages. The climaxes, innuendos, and nuances are in polished and exhualted shape. The Smithsonian Chamber musicians themselves sound and feel the music in a united sense!"
4,Passionate and engaging,"This recording is very dynamic, espcially the first movement of the Mendelssohn Octet, I simply admire the playing of the first violin.I would have given it 5 stars unless if it wasn't to the Hausmusik London recording. Though not as dynamic or passionate (though it certainly not lacking), the Hausmusik are first and foremost an ensemble.They boast higher level of precision and groupd dynamics.My recommendation is to get the both, you will not be sorry!"
4,Abby Mentions About the Holocaust!,Abby goes to her grandma's house to have a get-together. That's when she mentions a small portion of Anne Frank and the Holocaust. I highly recommend this book!
4,Good Book!,Abby is going to a family reunion and realizes a secret of her grandmother's. I liked this book because she really cared about her grandmother and wanted to see what was wrong.
2,DL Swivel Tongue Jack 3400,When I bought the boat new in Sept. of 2006 the DL Swivel Tongue Jack 3400 came with it. The jack does not come in contact with saltwater when launching the boat. The boat is garaged keep when not in use. The jack and swivel plate is rusted making it very difficult to crank the wheel down and maneuver the boat. I'm now looking for another brand. I feel it should have lasted much longer than it did.
1,Another Bust for Fred Pohl,"It is extemely difficult to select stories from five of the greatest SF writers (add Clarke and Asimov and you have the top seven) of the 20th century to give the whole volume a negative, downbeat tone, but Fred Pohl has managed it. If you like your stories upbeat and hopeful for the human race (in the editorial fashion of John Campbell) this book is a definite ""save your money."" I have been reading these authors since the 1950s, and I can't imagine a worse set of choices."
4,A single brilliant performance,"The rest of the album is very pleasant (although I haven't listened to it that closely), but the solo performance by Pinchas Zukerman in the Intro and Rondo Capriccioso is one of the best that I have ever heard."
1,Urgent Do Not Purchase - Amazon remove from shelves,"Lesson Learned: Amazon has no qualtiy assurance program in place to validate that the serial number to run the application is provided. 45 days and I am waiting for my refund.The reseller did not communicate the quality issue to Amazon. Her comment, oh we just resell and not inspect."
3,$12.99? You can get cheaper.,"There is a website online ""Oriental Trading"" that sells these exact same things for $4.99. I bought 5 of them for what 2 would cost here. Just a thought."
1,I wish I had my money back.,"This little saw was less than $10, but I wish I had the money back. The saw blade ran very vigorously until I used it on an actual pumpkin. Then it practically stopped. I wound up not pressing the power button, and just operating it as a hand-blade (I note another reviewer did this too), which, of course, negates the point of having a powered saw at all. The blade bent too easily. I've used other Pumpkin Masters products and liked them a lot--I think their scraping tool is excellent. But I have to wonder if the people who designed this ""saw"" have actually seen a real pumpkin?"
1,pupkin carver,The last time I ordered one of those it hardly went into the pumpkin. What I would like to have known before I ordered it is that the knife was not going to bend right when I put it into the pumpkin. I would not reccomend this item.
4,Good for travel,Fiber optic cable with a stout cover that will keep the cable from breaking over repeated use and movement. Best used for setups which are not permanent.
3,Canon Ink Tank for Pixma iP4000 printer,"VERY good price for the BCI-3eY Ink Tank. Reason? Only three old printers listed on the box instead of the dozen+- listed on more recent boxes = been on someone's shelf for a while. But...Part number was correct, box sealed and in good condition with ink in the tank.Tried it.Works like the others.Received promptly in good condition."
4,Great product but,For a Dove hair care product I am pleasantly surprised at how rich and thick the conditioner is. Of course I love the way it smells too. My only complaint is I find it leaves a heavy residue on my hair so in a day or so it appears greasy even though it's not. I've been using this every time I shower but I might limit its use to 1x/week to avoid the residue buildup it seems to create. Otherwise happy and I would buy again
3,Ok,"I bought this for my daughers, ages 13 & 11. The oldest tends to have dry hair. This conditioner is not any more conditioning than any other conditioner. It smells good, does not weigh hair down, but also is not super conditioning. It does detangle well and leave hair soft, but if you need something more restorative or reparative I would buy something else."
3,Selectively nice conditioner,"I got this conditioner because my hair is so damaged from heat and coloring that it's full of split ends and brittle strands.It smells great. It makes my hair really soft. But I really haven't noticed a change in the structure of my hair or instances of breakage, and I use it almost every day. That said, I think it works better than the run-of-the-mill conditioner in terms of softness and shine, it just doesn't ""intensively repair"" as much as I thought it would."
5,Love it!,"This product is simply fantastic. It doesn't give me flakes, and keeps my hair moisturized more than most conditioners I've tried. I use it with the Dove Damage Therapy Energize Shampoo. I love it and it smells great!!"
2,Good for the first week...,"I first received this shampoo and conditioner in a bath set for christmas (it came with the cucumber and green tea scented body wash and body spray as well - both of which I use frequently and love so I thought the products for my hair would be just as good). And for the first week it was. My hair was soft and clean (having long hair I wash it everyday). The best part was 8 hours after I washed my hair people would still be telling me how good my hair smelled, and that has never happened with any other shampoo/conditioner.However, about a week and a half after I started using it, after my hair would dry my part all along my scalp would feel and look greasy. I thought it was an issue of me not rinsing it all out but my hairdresser told me the intense repair was stripping too much from my hair and leaving it gross. Overall this shampoo/conditioner is too harsh for everyday use, and I ended up switching back to Aussie which works much much better for me!"
3,AutoRoute 2006 - town data missing,The program is nearly the same as Streets and Trips for the US. It's generally good but does not include many of the streets in towns in Ireland where I used it. Excellent for going town to town but real deficiencies in the towns when looking for specific addresses.
3,Microsoft AutoRoute Europe,"Was a good help in the early days of GPS, when specialized devices were basic and expensive. Now it's outdated. The only advantage left is relatively bigger screen of your laptop which someone (your passenger) will have to hold in their lap. Compare to modern specialized GPS devices this product is quite a bit behind the market: not enough flexibility, unclear and at times confusing directional instructions, faulty rerouting. Useful maybe in planning a trip but Google Maps is better these days. Get yourself a good Garmin and you will be much better off."
4,Excellent use of the program in Germany,"The good thing about this program is that you can go to sleep and when you wake up you are at your destination. Just kidding, but it was an excellent purchase as it got my wife and I across Germany a number of times and even into some remote regions. Although it does have its quirks as mentioned in other reviews, such as losing the GPS signal occasionally, it was a godsend when trying to negotiate the turnoffs on the Autobahn.My wife ocasionally complained about the computer because it got hot on her lap, but it was sure better than trying to read a map. To be sure, it is not the best tool to use if you are driving alone since you have to look at the laptop frequently. Also if you get off route, it doesn't tell you where to go to get back on the route again. You sinmply hope and pray that you will reconnect. That is certainly something they have to fix and, in my mind, the most serious shortcoming of this product.Other than that it was great."
3,Excessive drug use at Sony Classical in the 90s?,"This is an important CD release because it contains the definitive recording by Ormandy of Rachmaninov's ""Symphonic Dances"". For decades, Rachmaninov/Ormandy/Philadephia/Columbia were all virtually synonymous. Ormandy's reading of the symphonies on Columbia/Sony are, for most listeners, the benchmark recordings. The ""Symphonic Dances"" were dedicated to Ormandy and Philadelphia,so why the heck isn't this 1960 recording NOT included in an all-Rachmaninov/Ormandy compliation instead of being buried in a ""Ballet"" CD containing other works by Smetana and Offenbach! Has there ever been three more oddly chosen discmates for a CD!?! It probably is too much to ask that someday Sony will encourage a drug-free workplace and remaster and re-release the Ormandy readings of the Rachmaninov orchestral canon in a special set that this performance and the recordings of the three symphonies certainly deserve."
5,you've got to hear this.,"Produced by Augustus Pablo, with three part harmony vocals on top of tracks that appear in their dub versions on Original Rockers, this is an absolute classic on the level of Marcus Garvey by Burning Spear, Heart of the Congos, War ina Babylon and any Lee Perry produced Wailers. I have it on vinyl, so can't speak for the quality of the CD, but just to hear, Only Jah Jah Know -- whatever the quality of the pressing -- is worth it."
1,misleading product,"this is NOT an ""ultralight"" walker... those are 11 or 12 lbs. this one says shipping weight of 24 lbs. at best this is mislabeled, at worst misleading and unhelpful."
2,Duro-Med Ultra-Light Aluminum Rollator,"There is an error in the ad and I received a wheelchair cushion, not a rollator. The company agreed to just let me keep the cushion and return the purchase price."
4,Griselda witch mask,"The mask and hat are great and very scary. In the California climate, with temperatures in the high 70s Halloween, my little friend became a little too hot wearing it full face, so she tucked the mask up into the hat and wore the hat when she got too hot. She's 7 and that's what you get. Cooler climates would probably appreciate the outfit more unless worn indoors where the climate is more controlled. Really a great looking scary mask and hat, but a bit on the warm size. Fit just right."
2,Witch's Mask,The eye holes were too close together and the netting over the holes gave poor visibility. Hat was a nuisance when putting mask on. Not too happy with the product.
2,red soxs earrings,"Beware image shows to be silver tone, delievered in cheap gold tone. Seller stated can not always control what comes in. Seller should state that colors may veriy"
5,Daughter Loved Them!,My daughter has come to love the Red Sox while watching games with her dad. She saw these as we browsed for Dad's Christmas gift and went wild. They are adorable and well-made. Colors and design look great. A good purchase.
5,Magestic music,"These are Civil War songs and are sung in the usual all out effort of the Morman Tabernacle Choir. Many of these are simple songs and would probably be best with a solo singer and a guitar. To hear them sung with massed choirs, full blown organ and all the embellishments is pretty strange but all in all they are a pleasure to hear."
2,Needs a little brass.,"The lovely voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir are just not enough to drown out that infernal organ music. Where are the rousing brass bands, or drum cadences, or even banjos? Not here. This is just not authentic enough for the Civil War buff. Buy Ken Burns cd."
1,I have never been so disappointed in an online purchase.,"If you are looking for an authentic presentation of civil war music, this is NOT it!. I was hoping for something that was at least close to the traditional sounds of the songs. Not so with this CD. I will seriously doubt any other historical presentations by the MTC!"
2,Not impressed,"I purchased this product as my cats seemed to love nibbling on the rest of my houseplants and hoped to get them something a bit more suited to them. However, I was not able to get the seeds to sprout very well (some did) and ended up disposing of them after a short amount of time (refills for it are also quite expensive). I actually still use the planter they came in but I fill it with some organic wheat grass I'm able to pick up at a local farmers market for a much lower price (they just happen to fit in the container). As well, the planter doesn't respond very well to getting wet but has lasted a surprisingly long time - but if it wasn't the perfect fit for the wheat grass I buy elsewhere it would have been in the trash long ago."
3,not great,"only three of the four types of seed really sprouted. my cat loved it and munched on it constantly. however, just about a week ago, it all pretty much died. maybe my cat munched too hard? i still have the nice container, so i'm just going to get the seeds it came with and replant them in the container. maybe thats what i should have done to begin with. its a nice container though."
3,A very fast process,"This product comes with very easy to follow instructions to get started and one day after I planted the seeds, I was able to see some grass. The base is quite cute.I was amazed at the speed the grass grew, 5 days later it was fully grown. My two cats loved it, they enjoyed the 4 grass varieties. It was a great treat for them.The big problem was that after one week the plant died. I did everything possible to keep it alive Water/Sun/Shade(there are no instructions for maintenance)The whole process from the day I got it until the day the grass was dead and dry was around week and a half.I though it was going to last longer."
2,Grew grass then mold,"Well the big problem is that it grew mold. I don't feel like I was overwatering it but mold still grew. Before the mold grew my cat would throw up after eating it. That's more my cat's fault than an issue with the product I think. She tends to over eat and I think she just ate too much grass too fast, if I let her eat for a few minutes and then put it away. My other cat didn't have any interest in it. I would maybe give it an extra half star if half stars were allowed. The base is nice but the part that the seeds go in and the soil are not so great."
3,Grows fast!,"Easy to grow but my cat had no interest in the grass.Started wilting in 8-9 days,completely dead after 12 days."
4,the grass is growing!,"I bought this product because my cat loves, loves, loves grass. I originally bought the chia pet cat grass but it died almost immediately. The grass is growing from the planter great so far. I will wait till it gets bushy before letting my cat eat the grass this time though."
2,mold and insects grew in my planter,"I was so excited to purchase this planter. My cat is only allowed indoors and loves cat grass. After following the instructions to a tee, I waited the 4 - 6 days as instructed to wait for the grass. When I went back to check on growth, I saw one or two shoots coming out and a green fuzz all over the soil. Also, in the window that I had placed the planter to grow, was an influx of flying insects that were not there prior to the introduction of the planter. The only way those insects could have appeared exactly at the window where the planter was, is if they came from the planter itself. Needless to say, I threw away the grass and will have to look for other sources. Incredibly disappointed."
5,SmartCat Kitty's Garden,My cats love theirSmartCat Kitty's Garden Edible Grass and Planter. I catch them nibbling on the grasses all the time.
3,Nice grow box,"Box is nice..seeds grew fairly fast..bottom line, cats did not like them..may be just our cats..oh well"
2,Does not grow,"Although the box is nice, the seed does not grow. I put in seed from another kit and it grew just fine."
4,"Chomp, chomp","Length:: 0:25 MinsI took this video right after I showed the newly-grown grass to my cats for the first time. Following the included instructions, the four types of seeds grew to the length in the video in one week. They've been enjoying it - both eating the grass and occasionally pulling pieces out to play with. The included planter is well-designed: attractive and fairly heavy.Tip - one reviewer noted that the replacement grass does not include the instructions that come with the planter. While it's not rocket science, I will need to refer to the instructions for at least the first couple re-plants. So, to keep them handy, I store the instructions underneath the bottom black plastic container (between the black container and the planter.)Edit - one week after posting this video, all of the grasses are much taller, thicker, and lusher. I've been adding a bit of water every day to keep it moist."
3,For Cats,"This stuff sprouts and grows fine, but tends to die off pretty quick. Once it's at 3-4"", time to give to your cat. Kind of a 2 time treat for your cat, then it's time to chuck. All depends on what you expect it to do; doesn't last long, once kitty hits it a time or 2, it's done and dead."
3,Mixed results,"Maybe I couldn't farm my way out of a wet paper bag, but I never got mine to grow very well, or stay alive long enough for my cat to enjoy it. Tried multiple times, too."
5,Picky cat,"I ordered this item because I noticed that my cat liked to eat the grass whenever I let him outside. Since he only gets to go out occasionally, and then on a lead line, I thought he would like having grass inside to eat. Well, apparently he only likes eating outside grass. Lol! The item was exactly as I expected it though. The wooden box that you plant the grass in is very heavy duty and I was impressed. I was able to place this on the floor and it doesn't slide around and wouldn't be knocked over easily. My cat finally started taking some interest in the grass as it was all dying. I need to order more grass for it and will get around to that eventually. This was well worth the money and I'm very happy with the product."
1,A Joke,"The box is cute enough, but could they SPARE the seeds? Only about 1/4 of the poorly rationed seeds grow and in one square only a few sprouts appeared. Don't waste your money."
1,Price Keeps Going Up!!!!- Not Worth it,"The product is pretty good, grows fast but you can get mold/mildew on the soil very easily. The hot water they tell you to use to expand the soil plug adds to this growth. My cat loved 3 of the 4 grasses as noted by others and you can use 1/2 the seeds to extend the life span by planting it twice. In addtion the cat can get munching and pull this out of the caintier as the container is too light, I have to hold it down with rubber bands.I could take all that but now the proce keeps going up. This used to be $5 and is now up to $10!!! I will not pay this price anymore. Save your money and buy in bulk and skip the pretty container."
3,Now if I could've gotten my cat to like this...,"It was very easy to assemble, the grass grew fairly quickly. The only problem I had was getting my cat to like it! He would sniff it then walk away...that's it. He was completely uninterested with the grass. Now if he liked it, then this is totally worth it. I guess it depends on the cat!"
1,"There are far better planters, I'm sure","My grass didn't grow more than an inch after almost 2 weeks and very sparsely, in one section only two or three blades of grass sprouted. I know I did everything right, come on- it's grass. I wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing this item, it seems like this is a common issue."
1,It never grows!,Only two or three seed actually grew.I did follow all the instruction.This is very disappointing!I don't recommend this at all!
4,Pretty Big pendant,I really liked this pendant although the color of the stone I received was much lighter and greener than that pictured. It's very large and makes quite a statement. I've gotten several comments on it. If you're sensitive to such things it's a little on the heavy side. I wear it on a silver Omega necklace and it's quite a showy pendant.
4,Strong and Solid,Strong and solid. An easy install for anyone who is having battery drain or just wants a quick way to disconnect a battery. Worth the money.
3,flimsy,"the thing works, but it is flimsy made for what you pay for it, the piece between the battery post and the blade post is way to flimsy, feels like it could brake if you are not carefull with it. but it does work, thought it should be of better quality for what i paid for it."
2,Did not fit on my battery post otherwise well constructed,"This switch is very heavy duty, well constructed. I had to return it, however, because the hole in the cast part did not fit on my standard size 24 battery post (marine battery). Not sure if I got a defective one or they expected me to hammer the thing on."
4,Tragic Legacy,"In ADDICTED TO YOU, readers meet Nickie who has the grave misfortune ofinheriting her mother's demons -- drug addiction and an abusive relationship.Nickie's life began as a crack baby to a mother who valued drugs more than herchild. Cocaine and abuse became her friends early in life as they were theonly things that her parents knew how to offer her.ADDICTED TO YOU follows Nickie's life as she walks in her mother's footstepsand discovers drugs as well as a seemingly attentive boyfriend. However,unlike her mother, Nickie craves human contact more than any drug as sheclings to a relationship with a man who is on a certain path to destruction.Nickie must discover strength and self-reliance which are foreign traits toher, but critical to her survival.Thadine Quick tells a compelling yet disturbing story that is all too commonin America today. Her style is stark and direct which makes for a quick readwith lasting impressions.Reviewed by Diane Marbury (HonestD)of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"
5,Full agreement,"The reviewer below pretty much says it all. This is an essential set for anyone wanting to understand how rock & roll evolved from blues, C&W, and pop music. I'd add that Charlie Rich's undubbed recordings of ""Don't Put No Headstone on My Grave"" and ""Who Will the Next Fool Be"" (my all-time favorite song) are even better than ""Lonely Weekends."""
4,Good Stuff!,"More mellow than Entwine, but great stuff! Unlike the one before, this disc has more simple song-structures and is not as concerned with being all ambient. To Leave is INCREDIBLE and sad."
1,Not like the tests I have taken for MA or RI,"There are too many unrealistic questions in this book. Many times he contradicts himself in his answer section. He focuses so much on how to answer the tricky questions that he makes it impossible to do exceptionally well on the tests. The tests in this book were not like the tests I have taken in the past for MA or RI. I give this book ""Two thumbs down."""
2,Not for 6' or taller people,"If you are 6 ft or taller it may not serve you. You can make it work but you will need a very high desk to work from as it sits a tall person up to high and would make you bend over double almost to use with a regular desk & or computer. Mine is collecting dust, too expensive for that. Shins hurt after sitting on it for more than 10 minutes best guess you have to build up to using it."
1,unimpressed --,"disappointed. I guess I expected more of a primer on the emotional impact of spanking, not a list of spanking instruments! All this is, literally, is a list of things one might grab to use to spank someone. My kindergarten students could have written it!"
2,I wouldn't recommend this book,"I was disappointed in this book.It is very small, and really didn't have much information.I wouldn't recommend it and I wish I would have saved my money.Shipping time was average"
5,"Puffins, Peacocks, maybe a Plover!","Donna Andrews does it again! I enjoyed Murder with Puffins even more than I enjoyed Peacocks. The humor alone made this book an absolute delightful read. I laughed through the entire book. The characters seemed to jump off of the pages. The ""birders"" in the story were hilarious. Miss Andrew's descriptions of characters and events take on a life of their own. I become so caught up with the characters, that I forget about the mystery at the beginning of the story. When the mystery falls into place, the story takes another fun avenue. This mystery takes a lot of turns and twists. I enjoyed trying to figure out who ""did it"". I can't wait for the next book!"
3,But I loved her first book!,"I waited eagerly for Donna Andrews second novel. After all,anyone who wrote Murder with Peacocks would surely come up with anequally interesting second venture. Not so. While the writing style of Murder with Puffins is good, the plot falls somewhat flat. Perhaps I overdosed on the family, and don't find their antics so cute any more. Or perhaps I want our heroine to show a little backbone and get a life of her own, instead of running about doing everyone's biding. A fair novel, but for the next one, I'll wait for the paperback."
1,Murder with Puffins,"Although this book was recommended by a member of my book club, I didn't finish the book. It was just too cutesy for me. The characters were cariacatures rather than real people. Meg and her boyfriend, Michael, are not real people. Her actions are inappropriate and he is just a handsome cipher for her. I don't recommend this book."
3,Murder Most Fowl,"Meg and new boyfriend Michael are trying to have a romantic getaway in the 2nd book of this series. What goes wrong? Well, first they get seasick, end up in the middle of a hurricane, get stranded on their island destination with Meg's family, and then stumble upon a corpse. In true Meg fashion, everything that can go wrong does go wrong.This book was funny and contained a large list of zany characters. Like the first book in the series, there are many, many suspects and Meg's dad appears to be the lead suspect. Also like the first book, I felt that there was too much information and too many suspects to sift through them all. I liked the comedy, but I hope in future books Meg's dad is featured more as a help to solving the case rather than a suspect.This book (and series) are great for a vacation read or a long day at the beach.The first book in the series is ""Murder with Peacocks"". Enjoy!"
2,Disappointing!,I just got done reading this book. What a disappointment! I had high hopes for this series. The first Meg Langslow book was outstanding & I could not wait to read book 2. This book was way too long & drawn out. Meg came across as a little pushy know it all that dragged poor Michael around by the nose hairs. I will read book 3 just because I already have it. Hopefully that one will be better if not I am done with this series.Don't waste your time reading this one!
3,"A good second book, but not as good as the first",I found Murder with Puffins to be funny in some parts. But I keep waiting for something really good to happen. The first book kept me in stitches but I found Murder with Puffins almost boring. I felt as if there wasn't any new material being used in this book. I so enjoyed reading Murder with Peacocks and was disappointed with Puffins. I hope Ms. Andrews next book brings something new to the mystery that I so hoped Puffins would be.
3,Amusing Cozy,"Meg Langslow is back and plans a weekend get-away with her boyfriend, Michael, to her aunts cabin on a Maine island. What she didn't plan on was running into her family, the very people she was trying to get away from! On top of that, a hurricane is bearing down on the island and the ferry has stopped running. Then one of the island's most famous residents is murdered and Meg's dad is the prime suspect.This is the second installment in the Meg Langslow Mysteries. This is the same type of light romp that the first was. Ms. Andrews continues with the humor that made the first installment (Murder with Peacocks) so enjoyable. This edition drags a little more than the first did, and of course, is full of red herrings. Cute cozy mystery and I will continue with the series."
1,Don't Take This Book Seriously!,"John Patrick knowingly gives erroneous advise in this book. He admits to being incapable of using computers to determining how to play. Therefore, he starts with the general consensus (from competent analysts) on how to play then changes it with his own feelings (superstitions I guess). He explains that his money management techniques make up for the erroneous plays. But, all that does is help you lose your money slower, which is all this book can offer. Try one of his detractors' books. Many of them can teach you to play with an advantage over the house."
1,"Save your money, don't buy it!",I have never read such a terrible book in my life. This is THE most condescending book I have ever read. It has such a tone of superiority that you just can't get through it with its self congratulatory tone. UGH! Move on... The books by Stanford Wong are FARE superior...
5,Great Product - Super Expensive Shipping!,"This puree was absolutely delicious! I used it to make white chocolate raspberry cheesecakes, raspberry vinaigrette, raspberry mousse filling for cake and an accompaniment to flourless chocolate cake and lemon pound cake. The shipping costs more than the puree. As much as I love this product I may start making my own rather than spend $50+ for raspberries and sugar."
1,Bad experience with this one,When I first got the drive it worked fine and it was very quiet compared to the optorite DVD burner I have also. But 6 months later when trying to burn DVD's I got all sort of strange errors. It first stoppped burning and now it do not read any of my CD/DVD. The most frustratingg part was dealing with Memorex so called customer support which is like no support at all. I Suggest you forget this drive and get something else.
2,I wanted to like this CD,Sometimes when you get a CD it takes a few listens to enjoy it. I gave this CD more chances than most out of respect of a player of the Chapman Stick. But it never reached the marks that the other reviewers gave it.
2,Memories,These songs bring back memories of when I was a little girl and would decorate the tree with my mother and brother...
3,Okay,"The original lineup was the best and the one I grew up listening to, then in 1991 they made it a little better when they added two extra tracks from the original lineup and one from Ray Charles NICE!But then some knucklehead felt the need to mess up the groove and delete Joe Tex and Ray Charles' songs from the lineup and then add Donnie Hathaway and Luther Vandross whom have nothing to do with that time period ! WTF !?!?Thats why I can only give it three instead of five stars."
3,GOOD COMPILATION!!,"Out of all the songs on this CD, King Curtis' WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEW YEAR'S EVE and THE CHRISTMAS SONG tops them all. These instrumentals that takes me back to a simpler time where black is black and white is white. Listening to it makes my eyes misty and my throat choked up and feeling all giddy inside. The King Curtis - Duane Allman combo captured the true meaning of devotion to their craft - making real beautiful music. Getting this CD is worth it if you want to listen to those majestic songs!"
5,Revere 13 Piece Culinary Classic Set,"This pot/pan set is awesome -great quality, awesome price. Additionally, it comes with a manufacturers warranty of 25 yrs."
3,Only OK,Pans pitted and discolored on the inner cooking surface after initial use. I gave away a better set of pans to have room for these; a big mistake.
5,These pans are worth every penny,"I ordered a set of these pots and pans for myself to check them out, because I couldn't believe that for $50 they would be very heavy. I was wrong. They are amazing. They have the nice thick bottoms, and the metal handles don't get hot. I liked them so much, I ordered 2 more sets to give for presents."
5,Awesome,"I had read the first two Shamer books and had been uncertain as to actually reading The Serpent Gift. I am so glad that I did.My praises and qualms:- The entrance was a little slow, but the story swiftly picked up speed.- The prose is alright -- not excellent -- and not dreadfully annoying.- The characters were interesting and decently well developed.- The story *flowed.*- Even with two view points driving the book, Kaaberbol allowed only a little repeating of the same events.- A pleasing mixture of humor and seriousness.Overall, this book is more mature and engaging than the previous Shamer books. And now I await the publication of The Shamer's War!"
5,Every bit as good as the first two books,"I absolutely loved this book and this series. After I read the first book, I wondered why I hadn't heard of this author or these books. They captured my attention from the start and held it to the very end. They really made me think--something I feel is missing in too many books these days. They are very well-written, and the language became even more impressive when I discovered that Lene Kaaberbol is from Denmark and translates these books into English herself.Great series that I would highly recommend.(One note--these books do contain some vulgar language [no more than two or three words per book] that may not be appropriate for young children.)"
3,Good recordings from the 1960s.,"This CD is taken from two sessions the Choir recorded in 1960 and 1969, the earlier session (thirteen of the thirty tracks) being sung accompanied by the Philidelphia Brass Ensemble, and the latter session carried by the Tabernacle organ alone. The CD is generously filled out to 74 minutes, with 30 tracks crammed into the running time. It's intriguing to hear the finesse the choir has achieved in the last 40 years; if you compare this recording with their latest: ""A Tabernacle Christmas,"" the improvement in the latter recording is dramatic. The recent creation of the Orchestra at Temple Square has been a much-admired improvement, but this recording has much to recommend it, including fervent readings of ""Onward Christian Soldiers,"" the somber arrangement of ""Abide With Me"" and many others. Overall, a stolid, sincere recording which pales somewhat compared to the brilliant recent releases from this world-class choir."
5,Peaceful listening,"Steve Cumming played this version of God Be With You Till We Meet Again on his last broadcast show for classical WRR radio in Dallas. If there was a dry eye in the listening audience, I would be surprised. In addition to the song he chose, this recording has all of your favorites performed with beauty and majesty."
2,Is this really the MTC?,"I've now played this CD several times and am always left wondering whether someone is fielding a back-up choir because it has none of the usual majesty of the real Tabernacle Choir.The recording is a bit ""thin"" and I've only kept it because I know the MTC can do and has done so much better."
4,Classic Hymns,The CD is beautiful. The quality you'd expect from the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. These are the hymns I've known all my life. Very comforting to listen to.
4,Great Product,"It seems like it will probably do what it needs to do, I really just wanted to point out that the picture makes the product look pink, it is actually bright red.Seems well made, my goalie daughter says it's comfortable and likes it more than the protection head band she has worn in the past."
5,great product,this is a great product to protect childrens head. our daughter wears it all the time after an injury to her head
3,A Pirate's Life for Me,"Antony's book provides an interesting look into the life of pirates and seafarers in late imperial China. Though the book is short it does give one an interesting look into the life of pirates. The rampant disease, homosexuality, and violence makes for an interesting read. Though I am no expert on pirates or China I found the book informative and well researched. Overall a good, quick read for anyone interested in the lives of Chinese pirates."
4,Great book,I was looking for a book on Asian pirates for my boyfriend for Christmas and this was perfect. He loved it!
5,Elvis is Back!,"According to the liner notes, James Brown was dubbed ""the King"" by the ghost of Elvis. Excellent choice, E! This guy is great.I love a good cover version of a familiar song. Hell, I love a bad version.But these are GOOD. It's amazing. I think the haunting version of John Lennon's ""Working Class Hero"" is the best on here, but there are several incredible performances.Kudos to the production team as well. They didn't try to make it sound like the music from 1977 or 1968 or 1954 (whichever Elvis was your favorite). They go with a modern production style. Excellent.James ""the King"" Brown pays homage well..."
2,Entertaining but ultimately disappoints,"Perrotta does a good job of setting up the situation and establishing interesting characters. The story has potential, but when the protaganist faces a major moral dilemma, Perrotta just lets him skate by. I felt there were too many missed opportunities and easy answers to give this book a high rating."
3,Not bad...,"Perrotta does have a very good writing style. His use of dialogue is very exact and it kept this book moving for me. The plot was of interest to me, though I did not go to college in this era.I felt a little lost in the latter parts of the book. There seemed to be a central focus in the beginning and, for me, it tapered off considerably. I really wanted more of an interaction, later in the story, between Cindy and the narrator."
4,A Modern Day Cather in the Rye!,"I read a review that compared this book to Salinger's character, Holden Caulfield (but yet a little more worldly and experienced). I couldn't agree more. For those of you who loved Salinger's novel, you will enjoy Joe College. An honest and cunningly written novel that takes you back to an age where you ""thought"" you knew everything. There are very few characters that you want to dislike, and yet despite all of their shortcomings, you completely identity with and end up loving! READ IT!J. Young"
3,Ok,Not much plot but excellent depth of character and emotional intensity. Tom understands who people are and how they interact. I recommend it.
4,You don't have to be from the Garden State...,"Ever since Election I became a Tom Perrotta fan. Like the protagonist Danny in Joe College, I am a native of Jersey who also graduated from an Ivy League school in the early 80s. I think that combined with a very entertaining story is why I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. In retospect it's not a great novel but certainly one worth reading. Joe College is a real period piece, a world of pretension in its very accurate depiction of students in an ivory tower world contrasted with the blue collar grit of Jersey. Now that this once much maligned state is now somewhat in vogue (thanks Sopranos) its fun to read about the very accurate love/hate relation its residents have - I moved to California in '84 which was my first chance to get out but still hold it in high regard. Great story, great characters and definitely poignant at times. Highly recommended but don't expect an unforgettable experience, just a very satisfying one."
3,Not his best,"When did it become a prerequisite for male contemporary authors to pen narratives with college students as protagonists? Michael Chabon's Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Bret Easton Ellis's Less Than Zero, and Ethan Canin's For Kings and Planets were all very unbalanced and unoriginal and detracted from their best works. Tom Perrotta's attempt is the most convincing and the least pretentious of the bunch, but it is still not up to par with his short story collection (Bad Haircuts), where for a brief moment, I thought he was Raymond Carver reincarnated. We don't need another Ivy League Bildungsroman with contemporary identity issues and rehashes This Side of Paradise, thank you very much."
2,Enjoy Joe College: Not so much a novel as a series of events,"Perotta's _Election_ and the movie it inspired were fascinating and original. _Joe College_ is, at best, mildly entertaining. The first half of the book brings you ever deeper in the life of Danny, a confused Yale Junior. He is conflicted by the discontinuity of his life in New Haven and that of his family and friends in New Jersey.While the events are interesting, the remainder of the book does not do much to show how Danny grows or matures. Several plot lines are tied up in the conclusion, but one is left with the feeling that the book was simply a list of things that happen to Danny and that there is no underlying theme."
4,Funny!,"After I read Election, I had to read more books by Tom Perrotta. Luckily, he came out with Joe College, and it was wonderful! It was one of the funniest novels I've read in months, and it was bursting with Perrotta's honest writing. Read this book, you won't regret it!"
3,a major disappointment,"I read this after reading Perotta's wonderful ""Little Children."" His humor, his insights, his sharp observations, his affection for his characters - all are there. What is not there is a sense of structure, a center of gravity, a consistent viewpoint or any movement toward character development. These flaws point up how much the author learned in the three years between novels, but his sensibility in this book lies uncomfortably close to grad school moral righteousness and self-congratulation. The main character is rarely very funny and his friends are interchangeable. In some instances, the minor characters are more strongly drawn than the major ones. But keep watching this guy - he may just take the right risks someday."
4,Town and Gown,"Danny is an introspective, intelligent kid from working class New Jersey going through his Junior year as an English major at Yale in the early eighties. He doesn't fit in at home in New Jersey but seems to fit in at Yale even though all his friends come from wealthy upper class families. The most interesting parts of the book take place back home in NJ with his parents, his friends or his summer fling with a local girl. He is a likable kid even though he doesn't always make the conventional right decision. He can be self centered but even those selfish decisions end up OK. Most of the book is the ordinary that most of us experience but the author does add in a few dramatic elements that speed things up without distracting too much from Joe College. All the characters are what you would expect in the real world - shades of grey versus black or white."
3,"Didn't Love It, Didn't Hate It. . .","My experience with Joe College was right down the middle. At times, I really enjoyed the story; I feel the author did a good job of capturing the atmosphere of the time and the characters, and the idea of reading tales of college life was enjoyable.But, at other times, it was boring. The characters didn't appeal to me very much, which didn't help. Even the main character wasn't a favorite of mine.Overall, I liked the way the author wrote and I'd be curious to read another of his books to see if I liked that one better. However, Joe College was just okay for me, and I probably would not read it again."
2,Not Great...,"I didn't DISLIKE this book but I found it to be airy...insubstantial. I felt as though I've read this stuff elsewhere before - and done more humorously. Still, I enjoy Perotta's voice and I'll probably read something else by him...but not right away."
4,Funny stuff,"A funny, interesting tale of the college life at Yale. For me, a high school student, it is nice to read a light-hearted, ""real life"" description of what college is like, as opposed to everything one hears from teachers, parents, etc. It made me want to be in Matt's (the protagonist's) shoes..except, of course, for smoking pot and eating kimchi. :)"
3,Joe College = Joe Smith,"This book is only okay, I think it's a bit too much of a college stereotype, as I'm in college and never experienced half the thing Danny went through. It's not good enough to recommend, but its not bad enough to condemn."
3,I dont understand the hype...,"I really enjoyed Little Children (even though the ending left a little to be desired) I wanted to read more of Perottas books, so I came onto Amazon and read the promising reviews for Joe College. What is so great about this book? I dont love the main character or his friends. And, its taking forever for the story to go anywhere, I feel as if I were reading someones diary. I'm writing my review prematurly, as I still have 50 pages to go. Something great better happen.. or I'm giving up on Perrotta, (even though I already bought used copies of Wishbones and Election)"
1,a powerful streak of girlish sincerity,"When I saw the endorsement from Elinor Lipman, master of the comic novel, I had to look into this book, which I did up until page 45 where I read, ""The more time we spent together, though, the more I'd come to realize that her reserve was rooted as much in shyness as in confidence, and that her quiet sophistication masked a powerful streak of girlish sincerity."" Wow, what Robert Benchley could do with a sentence like that."
2,Did not fit my case,"I wish the specs said that the rear metal bracket was a short one, but they don't. I need a tall metal bracket to fit my case :("
3,The Great Book of Modern Warplanes,"In reading the description of the book, I had expected a lot of details on the ""modern"" airplanes, i.e., F-117, B-2, Gripen, Rafale, F-22, JSF, etc. However, the information on these airplanes was sparse at best. I was under the impression that full coverage of these planes would be the same as the with the current airplanes, i.e., F-16, F-15, F-14, F-18 and A-10. I don't know if the authors, who are well know for their in-depth coverage of warplanes, were under a tight schedule or what. They should have perform the same coverage as they did with the current warplanes. Overall a good history book."
3,"Interesting, but with a few BIG errors","This book scores big points with me, as it has a lot of interesing reading & great pictures. On the other hand, it sports a couple of glaring errors in the writing which undermines one's confidence in the rest of the book. The author who covers the chapter on the F-14 Tomcat for example, seems to have made up the section on deployment. In big, bold letters at the beginning of the chapter, and again on a table of squadrons, he announces that all but eight F-14 squadrons have been decommissioned. A quick check with the Navy (I highly recommend their web site) confirms that no less than 13 squadrons presently exist. Is this a ""nitpicky"" detail? Possibly, but the people who publish these books are supposedly aviation experts....I'm glad they're not writing medical references... Creative writing notwithstanding, this is still an interesting book."
2,Great selections but an audiophiles nightmare!,"I applaud the effort to make available these recordings by the Raelettes but sometimes it it better to leave things undone. It is a fact that many cd's are transcribed from phonograph records and I have a lot of them but if a company or person is going to sell these cd's to the public, then they should make an effort to clean up the recordings using one of today's computerized digital processing programs to eliminate clicks, pops and other distortions. Titanic records did not do this and the result is a bad sounding product. (with the exception of the first 10 or 11 tracks transcribed from a decent sounding LP.)I paid about 16 dollars for this cd and it's not worth it."
3,"Great Music,Ordinary Sound","While this is a good collection,like the previous critique this has a lousy sound quality,with the latter tracks having awful peak distortion.Its always the rub wanting to have the ""great hard to find"" music getting it only to find that the transfer is less than adequate......C'est la vie !!"
2,Blah,"A weak plot and a protagonist I didn't care about made for an unsatisfying read. Carter's hero, Nanette, came across as far too contrived a character for me to get in to. She's a jazz freak, who's got a master's in French and passes her days busking with a sax on the streets of New York, and her best friend is a stripper--ooo, neat. The murder of an undercover cop in her apartment kicks things off, but it never goes anywhere that interesting. Might actually be better as a movie."
5,Excellent!,"This album takes hold and won't let go. Haunting melodies suffused with heart-pounding beats, these songs have been crafted with painstaiking care, and will absolutely enthrall your senses. Rich textures in bright majors trip and spin beautifully over soft minor highlights... a dimension few musicians are even aware of. Most of these songs fall into the ""I never get tired of hearing them"" category, even if the CD never leaves my stereo. Now when can we expect the next album?"
5,a heavenly journey,"i could try to explain the effect of this album, but that would take 100 pages. so i'll tell you this... every time i hear this album, i get a little bit closer to heaven. buy it and listen to it again and again. it is incredible!"
5,Excellent and Fascinating,"This is a concise and extremely well written summary of Hogarth and his times, containing many insights into 18th century cultural history. This was a time in which social critics and ""self-help"" authors were beginning to take over some of the authority formerly held by the church on moral issues, and Hogarth was in the vanguard of those attempting to illustrate how personal liberty if unchecked by good behavior could descend into licentiousness and ruin. Among other interesting topics covered are Hogarth's feelings about the British class system (having risen from modest origins through an apprenticeship as a silver engraver to fame and fortune as an artist and printmaker), his sympathy for the lower classes, and his antipathy to the artistic establishment which overvalued trite and derivative Continental art on religious and mythological themes."
5,Great workout music!,I have only owned this cd for a few days but played more than 5 times. The music is phenomenal. It has all the power for a great workout and a great mix of songs. You cannot stay unactive listening to it. This cd will make you get up and go. I highly recommend it!
1,Work Out Music: Not,"I found this to be ""jumpy"" and inconsistent, with a really poor beat. I use an eliptical for my cardio, and just could not get into sync with this workout cd. Finally just deleted it from my iPod. Disappointing."
5,amazing,"Steve Guyger has total control over that harmonica. One can tell he really enjoys his music, and he gets what the Blues are all about. What he does requires focus and dedication, yet on this album, he makes playing the harmonica seem so easy, like anyone can do it. He makes the difficult seem easy, which is a mark of greatness."
4,Just as order,"The price is about one half of what you would pay for the store,I will definitely purchase more spices from these people"
5,Instant Classic,"OMD was probably one of the most overlooked bands of the early 80's. They hit it big with 'So in Love' and 'If You Leave', but before then were many albums of unsurpassed orginality. Many of those songs are captured here. Many versions are equal to their studio counterparts, but some are even better. 'Annex' and 'The More I See You' fair very well and the version of one of their early hits, 'Enola Gay', is in my opinion, better than the original. This is a great disc for anyone who appreciates OMD's unique music. Most of these songs are 20 years old, yet they still sound great. This is a must-have for any fan!"
2,Counterfeit? Or lousy quality control?,"I also have had inconsistent results with this product. In addition, the labels on the cans aren't always the same--one indeed looks completely fraudulent. Another is dimmer and the contents were a slick, pasty substance that looked cheap and SIGNIFICANTLY different from cans that have more legitimate looking labels (they look brighter, crisper as if done on a proper printer, not some fly-by-night).So either they get their stuff from different suppliers with haphazard quality control in some cases or, as with SO many other products from drugs to DVDs, someone is canning some [...]crap and passing it off as Natural Balance. In any event, I'm disappointed, disgusted and dissatisfied with the company's response and apparent indifference to the issue."
1,"So bad, my cat pooped in her food dish after being served this!","I fed my cat, for the first time, a can of Natural Balance Venison and Green Pea wet food. First thing I noticed was she didn't eat it as quickly or enthusiastically as other wet foods. This morning I woke up to find that she pooped in her food dish! LOL, ""Message received!"", I thought to myself. Seriously, she has never done this before and has been mad at me all day.I don't think she's ever met a wet food she hasn't liked until this. I'm taking the rest back and will never purchase this brand again. What a shame, their website really got me to believe it was tasty, healthy food. After doing some research, found there are mentions on the web about 2 recalls recently involving Natural Balance and many others with similar complaints about cats not liking the taste.One review I read elsewhere summed it up perfectly, ""Even if this food is actually healthy, what's the point in serving it if my cat won't eat it?""."
3,THESE ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL 1960s RECORDINGS,"It should be noted that these are re-recordings Petula made in Nashville in the mid-1980s and do not have the full-bodied sound of her original 1960s versions. There are a couple of new songs thrown in, which Petula wrote, called ""Give It A Try"" and ""Mad About You."" This album is fine for collectors and completists, but if you want high-quality collections of the original hits, then buy a Petula CD on the BMG (in the U.S.) or Sanctuary/Castle labels (from the UK)."
3,Teaches from a Roman Catholic Perspective,"Readers should understand that this book teaches about Baptism from a Roman Catholic perspective. For instance, in the section ""Why we Baptize,"" the author claims that Baptism is ""necessary for salvation."" This is contrary to what Protestant churches believe, and, unless I am quite mistaken, what Eastern Orthodoxy teaches. I don't intend this as a knock against the book, but non-Roman Catholics who want to understand Baptism and teach their children about the sacrament will want to look elsewhere."
1,Not good,"this book is so all over the place, you'll need to make your own personal table of contents to make any sense of it. The book seems like a rush job, pieced together by pages of unrelated information. If you feel like having your head spin and ending up with a migraine, check it out! I'd be ashamed to be the author."
3,Not sure this ones suitable for total novices,"I'm inclined to agree with the reviews above that stated that this is NOT a good book for total newbies to cgi and Perl. On the whole I found it very useful but think I would not have benefitted from it so much if I didn't already have some CGI/Perl experience. The whole is biased towards UNIX which means shell commands such as Date, Time and Mail will not work without substantial modification if you're trying to run this on a Win 32 system. In addition there are a number of inaccuracies with some of the book source scripts on the enclosed CD (misdeclared variables, missing brackets etc) compounded by the fact that in one or two instances the printed script is not the same as the one on the CD. On the whole a good resource for intermediate scripters but it requires more than a little work if you are to get the most from it."
3,In a week?,"GGI / perl in a week? That's marketing for you. If the publisher put the truth in the title, maybe ""CGI/Perl in 2 months and you will still be struggling"" it wouldn't sell as much but it would be more realistic, unless you already have strong programming skills, which I do not."
3,Read other reviews carefully.,"I brought this book almost 3 years ago and I do not regret it. I wasn't new to CGI, but I think the book is good for both novices and professionals alike.Many responses criticised this book - read these carefully. Many books contain history. Ok so there is a CGI script missing ? Show me a book that doesn't. I couldn't believe the webmaster who thinks there is nothing to show how to write a CGI script. Did he read the book ???Seriously - does anybody considering buying this book think that it's not going to tell you how to write a CGI script ???A reader remarks that he has lot's of experience of Web Design but this book is not for beginners. But the review from the beginner says this book is great."
2,"Poorly designed, rushed, and very bad continuity","I felt this book was good only up to it's halfway point, where it strays from actually teaching you PERL techniques, to other things which have little to no relevance. Not saying that the first half was any good, either - the program sources themselves were riddled with continuity errors. Variable names changed from one reference to another in the same program. The author also took very little time to make sure the reader understood what was going on; too often he would cite code 'snippets' that did exactly what they were supposed to do, but then didn't tell you how to fit them together to actually make them WORK. I suggest O'Reilley's Animal Series CGI book (easily idenifiable in the bookstores with their animals on the cover and black-and-cyan colors) as an alternative to this one."
2,Not for beginners,"I was lost from the beginning, and I have a fairly good background in Perl and HTML. The book is supposed to be about cgi programming, but it gave more information about how to write HTML forms than anything else. There was one good script that was for beginners, the (first.cgi).Although, it too was only about forms and how to call html from a cgi program.It would be a good 2nd or 3rd book for cgi programming, but definately not for beginners"
2,Programs do not operate on my university's system.,"The good news about Herrmann's book is that it effectively demystifies Perl. Used in conjunction with the O'Reilly Lama Book, it is an effective way to learn Perl, because the exercises reinforce and clarify the O'Reilly text.The bad news is that many of the CGI's cannot operate on my university's system. It was very discouraging to spend the time working on programs only to discover that the system will not accept the program specifications. I then went to someone who is experienced in Perl/CGI and he adapted the programs for our system. This is a very tedious way to learn CGI's. As a result, I have been working on CGI's for 6 weeks, and am bewteen Chapters 5 & 6."
2,Not a good guide,I was very disappointed in this book. The examples were incomplete (I even found a flaw in the code) and the author fails to lead the reader through the learning process. The book also spends too much time in details without explaining the overall concepts
2,Definitely not for beginners,"I purchased this book with some programming experience and lots of web-design experience but was completely lost from the get-go. The author never explained about the programming structure or what many of the symbols mean. It is a good reference manual for someone who already knows Perl but not the Internet, but not vice-versa"
1,"I know I've already reviewed this book, but....",I just felt that an average of 3 stars is misleading and felt that it was my responsibility to prevent any other innocent readers from strangling themselves with this poor excuse for instructive literature...
2,"um, try another book","This book is not laid out well at all. The title is very deceiving because not only will it take you longer than a week, the author will make you take longer that a week with the disorganized mess. Mostly new users will be buying this book because it says ""In a Week"", however it is not worded for new users and has made for a disappointing book. It's an ok book, but I learned it from another book because I couldn't take it anymore. If you know what you are doing, and you like having someone talk like they know everything, instead of in plain English, go for it."
2,Wrong Code Examples in the book,"There are incorrect code examples in the book and their online ""help"" isn't. Unless you allready know some perl or have any other programming experience, this book not much help."
4,Great book if you have a basic knowledge of Perl,This book is not for the beginner. If you have a basic knowledge of Perl5 the concepts and examples in this book are very concise and straight forward. The author gives practical real world examples of the use of Perl in the CGI environment that allows the reader to quickly develop his or her own CGI scripts and applications.
2,The Book is poorly organized,"I was very unhappy with the book because of its very poor organization. As an example, in chapter 4 we read about passing information to Perl programs using the GET method. Then, in the next chapter, we learn about passing data using the POST method. Great, except that we don't learn how to _read_ the information in our Perl programs until after all of that.The upshot is that we don't learn how to read variables in Perl until page 128..."
5,Southern Living Cookbook 2001,"The cost is great especially since I trying to get a complete collection of Southern Living Christmas cookbooks. This cookbook is in great condition even though it is six years old, as was noted on the sellers page. I will continue ording until I complete my collection. I am grateful to the sellers for providing an avenue that allows me to find the missing years that I looking for. Thank you."
5,Glad I bumped into this book,"The Bumposaurus, by Penny Mckinlay, is the story of a baby brontosaurus who suffers from poor vision. The poor little brontosaurus is so blind he can't even find the way out of his egg. He keeps mistaking other dinosaurs for his food. His parents, unaware of their child's poor vision, give him several stern lectures on how ""Dinosaurs don't eat other dinosaurs."" You'll be delighted with how the brontosaurus and his family finally resolve his problem. The illustrations are silly. The text has wit to spare. I'm glad I accidentally bumped into The Bumposaurus. You will be as well...."
1,Overrated,"I purchased this CD based on a number of very positive reviews, but I found the music not to be very interesting."
2,caveat emptor!,"Dont be fooled by the ""grand"" reviews. Further investigate this album before wasting your money on it."
2,"Not thorough, and inaccurate","Chris Nickson seems to supplement his income as a music critic in Seattle by researching and writing unauthorized biographies about stars such as Melissa Etheridge, Mariah Carey, and Soundgarden. The problem is, none of the research is original at all....his entire book is swiped, without attribution, from already published interviews. There is not a single thing in this book that fans don't already know, and Joyce Luck's Melissa biography (which was also unauthorized, though I hear Melissa and her management liked the book) at least had some new, previously unpublished info and photos in it. Plus Nickson's book is just riddled with errors (for example, it says John Shanks was with the band during the Never Enough tour, which is totally false). One good thing about Nickson is that he at least doesn't have a problem with Melissa's lesbianism. Other than that I'd say his book's a total flop."
3,More please!,"I only gave this three stars -- usually most of my reviews have five --- because there are only three Lassie Christmas shows on this disc! I read the review before I purchased because I love Lassie as well as Christmas -- the three shows are very good, but I wish there were more! Not bad for the price, but still leaves one wanting to see more Lassie Christmas shows! I see that there are very few Lassie episodes released on DVD -- some on VCR - individual shows. Hope the powers that be read this review and decide to release more Lassie - Christmas and otherwise! It was just a wonderful show - warm, human, simple, which always left one happy at the end (as a child I used to put my hand up to the television screen to ""shake"" Lassie's extended paw at the end of each episode). We need to see this wonderful show again, especially in this day and age."
5,Why do I still love this music?,"Most of this music came out from 1976 to 1980. I'm writing this review in early February 2001. Disco icon Harry Wayne Casey (aka KC) recently turned fifty; he is still constantly touring and playing many of these same songs. So why am I still listening? Because it's fun! Even though most of these songs use a frantic dance beat, they are surprisingly relaxing and soothing. Maybe it's because they remind me of when I was a teenager, escaping into the enjoyable rhythm of KC's albums and cassettes (we won't mention eight tracks). Maybe I still love KCSB because they provided us with enjoyable music that never gets old.(Duane Simolke&#65533;s books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)"
4,A Soldier for the Empire,"An excellent book. I almost feel like George S_. If a person would want to feel what our founding fathers had in mind, and a direction we have taken oblivious to their goals, they should read this book. America is no longer a ""free country"" by choice. We have allowed our corporations ($$$) to control us. Thanks Helmling, I share your views."
4,ESSENTIAL FOR A RATT FAN,"THIS IS A ESSENTIAL DVD FOR A RATT FAN. PERSONALLY, I THINK CONTAINS ALL THE 80'S PLAYED VIDEOS, AND THE DVD ONLY SHINES WHEN YOU PLAY ""ROUND AND ROUND"" OR ""BACK FOR MORE"". THE OTHER VIDEOS IT DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME EFECT. IT COULD BE BETTER WITH SOME RARITIES LIVE VIDEOS FOR SONGS LIKE ""GIVING YOURSELF AWAY"". IN GENERAL TERMS,GOOD PURCHASE."
3,Nothing new here.,"I love Ratt. Give me a nice live show to check out. Nothing earth shattering here. If you need to replace your VHS versions, cool. Nicely put together."
4,Its cheese....,"It is what it is and its Ratt. You get their good videos, cheesiest outfits and above avg songs. I like it though because it brings back awesome memories of what the 80's were. Ratt was a top notch live act and jammed.They still tour to this day and I can't wait to see them."
5,Rattomania,A Super DVD for the hardcore RATT fan !A nostalgic trip to the eighties !I was very satisfied with this music DVD !
5,"RATT videos detonator , Ratt the videos","remmenber the songs of RATT in this videos plus videos like body talk, dance , slip of th lips"
4,"Good Overview, Needs Updating and More Prescriptive Info",This short pamphlet does an excellent job explaining the physiology of the gastrointestinal tract and how natural foods can help detox and restore proper flora in the intestines in terms an intelligent layperson can understand. Nice reference to scientific studies and has a good bibliography.Lacks information on Chron's Disease and whether the natural methods for detoxification can help reduce symptoms.Needs to be updated with recent progress and research as well as provide references to dietary programs (with solid scientific studies) that work.
2,Mediocrity,"I did not find this disc involving at all. The BPO is a fine orchestra (IMO not the finest at present), and Abbado is a fine conductor. However, I would look elsewhere for performances of Mozart symphonies. Mackerras' on Telarc are an excellent place to start.PS - no need to malign a reviewer to make your point (RE below). Mr. Hurwitz has pointed out some of Abbado's better recordings."
2,Item is not as shown in picture,i bougth this item thinking i was getting some cable boy was i wrong all i got was a 2 inch converter with know cable lead
4,Turning stones by Marc Parent,"Turning Stones by Marc Parent is not a book that you like to read it is a book that you feel you should read. It was an excelent story that was well written. The author takes us to places that we just as soon forget about, yet need to know exist. Parent makes us feel as though we are in the room with him the description is wonderful. The style of writing that he uses makes you realize he is just like you and me. This style makes the book easy to read and hard to put down. The events that Parent writes about are not easy to comprehend, you don't want to think that things like this happen. The stories of child abuse makes us realize that we are capable of such terrible things. The stories told through the eyes of a caseworker also reveal how hard it is to be a caseworker. After reading this book and realizing what public employees go through makes you appreciate them much more. This story of a caseworker makes us realize that we all have the ability to touch lives."
4,Turning Stones - My Nights and Days With Children at Risk,Marc Parent does a wonderful job of telling readers what life as a social worker in New York City was like for him. His examples of cases are brought to life in the mind of the reader with his use of details. His descriptions of people make them seem as real to you as to him. He uses stories from his childhood in Wisconsin that help you feel how he sees the situation. Even in the most grusome cases he is careful not to put blame on anyone for what has happened. It is a great book that brings you into the story.
4,Turning Stones by Marc Parent,"Turning Stones, in my opinion, is a book everyone should read. I think every American should be aware of what is going on in our world today. This book really made me think. Some parts were hard for me to believe that anyone would allow their children, their own flesh and blood, to be put through such misery. Some examples are living in a house full of rats, having drug dealers lurk outside the door, even leaving an infant in an abandoned warehouse. The thought of this makes me sick. However, I think people should be aware of this and hopefully, will be willing to do something about it. I especially enjoyed the ending chapter called Turning Stones. It made me realize and understand that one person can make a difference. Marc Parent made a difference. Even though he couldn't save them all, he still made a difference and changed peoples' lives. If you haven't read this book, I encourage you to do so. It will open your eyes, make you smile, and break your heart."
4,A story to the heart,"What would push a mother to throw her children out a window stories above the ground? Marc Parent left me with a bitter sweet feeling. Turning Stones is real, horrifing, comical, and hopeful all at once. Marc Parent describes the days and nights he has spent as a caseworker in New York. He tells horrifing reality of some children's lives and the satifaction he receives from helping them. The love he has for children is overwhelming. Turning Stones is wonderfully written and comes staight from the heart. MJM"
2,Too much to read !!!,"It was hard to get into,it was supposed ot be about cases and a caseworker, and the stories are pretty cool but he spent 3 pages talking about mumbo jumbo..stuff that wasn't irrelevant.The cases weren't as bad as other books I 've read on this subject.it was ok but i wouldn't read it againt"
5,Five Star Worthy,"""Turning Stones"" is truley deserving of Five Stars, it's an attention grabbing book. I am not one to sit down and read books, but once I started on this one I could barely set it down. Although every part of this book was great, one of my favorites was the time both he and his partner had to travel to the worst part of town and check up on several children. The situation they were in would be extremely difficult. The book always left me wondering how it's going to turn out, what's going to happen next. Parent did an excellent job in keeping his readers interested. Not one time through the entire book was I tired or sick of reading it. This book is truley deserving of Five Stars."
3,Fictionalized Reality,"Marc Parent was a case worker in NYC for child protective services, back in the late 1980's. While his experiences with the children and with their families seem to have come from his direct experience, some of the rest of the book reads like fiction. Small inconsistencies and errors also make me question the book's veracity. For example he writes about a mother coming here illegally from Puerto Rico with her children. Puerto Ricans are BORN citizens, so they are NEVER illegal. Missing a factual detail like that makes me wonder what else he missed or fudged or glazed over. It is an interesting read, but I would not necessarily take it as an accurate example of how things are 20+ years later in the child protection field."
4,Turning Stones,"The book 'Turning Stones' was a very well written book. The book was very discriptive and very well stated. This book made me realize how much child abuse is a very common thing. The book was very disterbing at times, but all that needed to be said was said. I dont think anyone could have said these things better than the way Marc Parent put them. the book made me look at child services diferently. it made me realize that they were trying to do some good in the world. they are trying to save lives of innocent childrent that adults were just throwing away. I feel that everyone should read this book so that they can see what a child goes throw, either through there eyes or the eyes of another. I feel this book will be around to help stop child abuse until it is controled and eliminated. Thank you Marc Parent"
4,An Applaud if Deserved,"It's amazing to think of those in this world that actually go to the job of a social worker everyday. To imagine the suffering that many children go through children alone is horrific but to actually work with them in everyday life is amazing. The world needs more human beings as Marc Parent to care for the children today that have noone to love them. For social workers to put their lives at risk so one child can have a chance at a better life earns them the title of ""HERO."" The way Parent went into detail with his cases really made me feel something. I believe it takes a brave person to be a social worker, and I applaud those who care enough for children to put forth their every strength to save even one child's life."
4,Someone Please Save These Children,"The book ""Turning Stones"" was so emotional, I don't know where to begin. There was so much sadness reading about the defenseless children, so much anger reading about the violence, and so much respect for the caseworkers trying to stop it all. My first reaction to the book was sadness for the children who have to endure the pain of not having the love and support they need from their parent(s). I can't even begin to imagine how hard it would be to grow up not having enough to eat, or not being able to play outside. It is no wonder we have so much violence in schools today; these children are growing up with violence all around them. And yet, we can't put all the blame on the parent(s). The way the stories are told, it makes most of the parents seem like hardworking people who are trying to do the best by their children, but don't have the ability to do so. Something needs to be done to help these children from the lives they are forced into."
4,A students view on Turning Stones,"Turning Stones is an incredibly interesting book for anyone to read. It gives readers a first hand account of family problems from a point of view not normally seen, a social worker. Many of the situations that are talked about in this book are ones that most of us do not experience. Marc Parent excellently writes this book. The book is easy to follow and very descriptive. As a reader you are able to visualize the situations as they are taking place. He builds the characters well not only through description but also dialogue."
4,A good read!,"If you're going to only read one book about the Child Welfare System of this country, this is it! I've never encountered anything like this book before. While at times, Marc Parent uses graphic detail to demonstrate what happens out there in the real world, it really seems necessary to get the full effect. At times it's hard to continue reading, but it's written in a way that draws you in and makes you want to find out what's going to happen next. It's an intense read and goes fast! I learned a lot about what happens in these places not talked about much. After reading, you feel poised and ready to go out and make a difference as Parent did! It makes you stop and reconsider your view of the world."
4,Turning Stones,"Marc Parent did an excellent job describing the lifestyle of an everyday social worker. I have gained a respect for these social workers that I have never had before. This book makes you realize what a person can go through physically and emotionally handling these kinds of situations. Parent used a very interesting technique writing his book. He not only described his cases but he also went into detail about his everyday life and the people surrounding him. He made you want to not put the book down and keep turning the pages to find out what was going to happen next. Overall, this is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is the least bit curious about what exactly goes on behind some of the closed doors in New York City.E.B."
4,Turning Stones,"Turning Stones is the compelling tale of Marc Parent and his four years working for Emergency Children's Services in New York City. Throughout the book, Parent shares eight shocking stories that are destined to keep the attention of the audience. Throughout the book, I was totally amazed at the extent of the stories, and often found myself doubting the fact that this book was indeed non-fiction. Along with the stories of the children, Parent also relates the emotional affects the job had on himself, and how the death of a baby boy brought him close to the brink of insanity. Turning Stones will definitely leave a lasting impression on anyone who reads it, and open the eyes of people to the vicious effects society has on children."
4,Turning Stones,"Marc Parent's uniquely descriptive writing style made this book very interesting. Parent created many vivid images that really grab your attention, to the point where you can't put the book down.Parent writes about his experiences during his four year employment at Emergency Children's Services. His descriptions of these experiences are very powerful, and they make you realize how big the problem of child abuse is. Parent colorfully describes the difficulty of working these cases, which many times include removal of children from their parents. This book will help you gain understanding and respect for child welfare workers and all social workers."
4,How to Change the World,"Turning Stones has a purpose. That purpose is to give an example of how one person can change the world if he puts his mind to the task and is willing to sacrifice maybe everything to that purpose. His tireless defense of the children of the night in NYC is something that everyone should strive to be, even if they can only save one. Parent's style of writing might be hard to follow, but the thoughts follow logically and it feels just how I would use totally unrelated events to lead into my main point. His emotional involvement in the lives of ""his"" children is evident by the first chapter, and this book will make you feel that same emotional attachment. Very hard to put down."
4,Turning Stones,"Marc Parent's book titled Turning Stones is more less a story of his profesion and how he got it. He starts the book by telling about his childhood in Wisconsin and how it compares to the lives of children in New York. His charachters become real. The drama in this book is like nothing I have ever read before. The bad thing about it is, it is real. He also gives the book life by adding quotes as if it is actually happening as you are reading it. The stories are powerfull and compell you to keep turning the pages. Some of these stories are not just about children in danger but of thier parents as well. This is a book that everyone can relate to. Whether it is moving from a small town to a big city or an abusive husband and of course, children that need help. I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good night's reading, after you start it, you wont be able to put it down."
4,A Child's Reality,"Turning Stones is a book about a caseworker named Marc Parent. Growing up in Wisconsin, Parent then moved to New York to begin his work dealing with critical cases involving children. Long nights involve taking children out their home environment to lead to a better life. Detailed stories give a realistic sense of Parent's job that leave you with emotional thoughts of these poor children. This book made me realize the tough lives that these children lead and that it is the responsibility of the parents that cause it. The conclusion of this book completes it. The story of the nuns turning over the stones so that each place is left changed because of them basically summarizes this book. Marc Parent is changing the lives of the children. He will be remembered by these children just as the nun wanted to make a change by turning the stones over at the stops on their vacation."
5,Horribly graphic yet compassionate and mesmerizing,"An account of one man's life as an agent for New York City's Emergency Children's Services. The stories will both shock you and touch your heart. A mother throwing her children out a window, a boy resisting the urge to kill his younger brother, a nine year old boy beating his five year old cousin to death. These stories and others are told in mesmerizing graphic detail. You don't want to read on but you must. The truth is told and it chills you to the core. Parent is an incredible writer, blending both humor and compassion into this tale about his life as a child welfare agent. It makes you sit up and think about our society and the value we place on these issues. The people who deal with these issues day after day are heroic. I urge you to read this book. It will defintely move you and make you think..."
4,Excellent book,"I really liked this book and I would recommend it to everyone. I am a person who does not like to read and I have a short attention span, however, Marc Parent kept my attention very well in Turning Stones. It was easy to read and also extremely interesting. Marc's organization skills were superb and he described the details so you could picture in your mind exactly what he was talking about. The stories were all very real and the places he had to visit really make you think about how rough life really could be. tjc"
4,Turning Heads,I have never experienced a literary work quite like this before. It caused me a myriad of emotions as I progressed through the lives of the children Marc Parent encountered throughout his four years as a social worker in New York City. Each true story is painted with rich detail producing a lifelike picture in my mind as each plot unfolded. It made me as a reader examine my own life and how I think about the parts of the world that are so real yet with which I have little or no contact. I recommend everyone read this heartclenching gutrenching in your face look at the reality of the lives under the staircase. LM JAC CP
4,"Disturbing, but Valuable",Marc Parent is a caseworker in New York. He has written here some very interesting and disturbing cases he has dealt with. Child abuse is always a difficult topic to read about but Parent doesn't condemn the parents in his stories. He gives you the whole story and lets you form your own opinion. Turning Stones is well written and very much a page-turner. AL
5,Turning Stones,"The book ""Turning Stones"" is a very capitvating piece that will completely change your mind about child welfare workers forever. It is a book that does a great job of always keeping your attention and never letting to put it down. It combines the grueling stories of Marc Parent, a child welfare case worker in New York City, his stories of back home in Wisconsin, and a occasional funny story about his co-workers and of the environment that they worked in. This was a great book that should be recommended to any person out there who is looking for a great book to read."
3,Reliving Turning Stones,"Marc Parent does a fine job of making the reader relive his memories as a caseworker in New York. In this book you can visualize the drama these children went through. Turning Stones flows nicley from one case to another, while really making the reader think. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.ROC"
1,SONY = Stops Operating Next Year,"This unit looks nice and plays nice, until it doesn't anymore.This piece of crap worked for only 3 months and was turned on about 10x only, as it stood in my bedroom where I only seldom listen to music. It went dead all of a sudden, and Sony doesn't honor the limited warranty !!Apparently, what I have (a short circuit, that prevents me from turning the unit on) is a common defect and it's even MENTIONED in the owner's manual (ie if you get standy flashing, you're in trouble!).I had several bad experiences with Sony, this will be my last. My advice is stay with Panasonics, they're way way way better."
1,Christmas Bummer,"The unit looks good and sounds good, but it will only play about 1 out of 10 discs that I try it on. A total bummer on xmas morning for my son, who could not listen to the 5 brand new CDs he also received. The unit tries to spin up and read the disc, but fails and displays ""No Disc""."
3,looks very strong,"Still I had issue, I lost my signal after connecting. may it is was waek already and got weaker."
2,PLEASANT ENOUGH ... BUT SURELY NOT THE BEST,"Based on the evidence of this recording, Salonen and his LA players have good instincts for Mahler and are well-suited in maximizing the symphony's raw feeling. At the same time, however, Salonen seems reluctant to dive headfirst into the score and as a result, the work's overall musical architecture appears weak and unsteady. Contrast this recording with that of Christoph von Dohnanyi & Dawn Upshaw with The Cleveland Orchestra (London/Decca), and you'll find there a much clearer, more persuasive idea of what Mahler sought to achieve with the Fourth."
1,Only Paleo in Name,"I've never tried these so they may taste fantastic, however, looking over the ingredients shows that these are in no way Paleo. If you are truly living, or trying to live, a Paleo lifestyle move on. Look at the ingredients below:Ingredients: Coating (Maltitol, Cocoa Butter, Nonfat Milk Powder, Whole Milk Powder, Lecithin (An Emulsifier), Natural Vanilla), Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate, Whey Protein Concentrate, Rice Protein Concentrate, Whey Crisps (Whey Protein Isolate, Rice Flour)), Maltitol Syrup, Almond Butter, Glycerine, Dry Roasted Almonds, Digestion Resistant Fiber (Fibersol 2), Coconut Oil, Fructooligosaccharides, Lecithin, Natural Flavor, Omega 3 Concentrate Complex, Xylitol, Covalent Bonded Glutamine (GlutImmune(tm)), Sea Salt, Green Tea, Elderberry, Rosemary Extract.3/4's of the items listed don't belong on the Paleo diet."
1,NOT PALEO!,"Buy them if you want them but not because they say paleo.They are not paleo and that is a fact...you cannot dispute that in any way. Whey protein is a processed substance = NOT PALEO. Brown Rice is a rice = a grain = NOT PALEO. Sugar alcohols are a processed subtance and a variation on sugar and therefore...you guessed it...NOT PALEO. There might be varitations of the paleo diet that allow dairy but the dairy should be raw unpasturised, unhomogenised milk from grass fed cows, butter from the same source or cream from the same source and only if your not lacto intollerent.These bars are not paleo but are trying to take advantage of people who are trying to live a clean lifestyle. If you need these bars your not eating paleo. Go have some nuts, meat, veg or something else.The bars might taste nice, I do not know because I eat paleo, however dohnuts, cream cakes, chocolate etc etc etc taste great...they just are not good for you. Learn paleo, live paleo and avoid these!"
4,My favorite flavor bar,Now this is the best paleo bar they make; tastes reasonably good and travels well. MUCH better than their chocolate flavors--especially the PB meal.
1,Mundane,All of the songs basically are done with the exact same style and sound the same. No versatility. I really like her when she performs on TV at awards shows and maybe that's her forte. I didn't keep the CD.
1,Did not work for me.,"Very quiet, no fan. I was all set to give it 5 stars but then I tested it with my 65 watt laptop power supply for witch I bought the inverter and it would not power it. It did power trivial loads such as my cell phone charger and my external 3.5"" hard drive. Maybe the laptop startup current is just too much for it. So be warned if you want to use this with a laptop. My old noisy inverter that plugs into the exact same 12v socket worked fine."
2,Large Screen the only positive.,"While it is a nice looking unit, it is slow at startup, not very user friendly, the email address in the hand book is not correct, the phone contact number is hard to get throuh to, the service support is poor and why it always launches on a site in Brooklyn, NY is beyond me.For the money it will pass, it was the allure of the large screen that drove the purchase, but next time I'll go with a brand leader."
2,entertainment !,"this is a nice looking unit, nice picture, but is slow, hardly get on time the signal from the sattelite, sometimes you can ride for hours and that still in nowhere, (stays in brooklyn by the way), the time that i have signal i was in the highway and the gps was showing me in another place, anyway, i think just for entertainment, in a few words, look impresive when is on, that is it!"
1,Used,I can't beleive this happened twice. I ordered this unit in Feb and was sent a package that had been opened before and when I attempted to turn the unit on was given the opportunity to see where the previous user from Upper New York State had used the unit before. THEY ACTUALLY SHIPPED ME A USED UNIT. When I tried to reorder a new unit I was told they were out of stock. In June I reordered and to my utter amazement I got a second used unit. This time used by someone in Brooklyn NY. If Amazon can't guarantee that it's venders are sending out new product they should drop them. What a Joke.
1,Don't waste your money,"Takes a long time to connect to a satelite, once it connects and you start to drive it loses the sattelite. Pretty useless as a gps if it can't stay connected. I purchased it because of the 5.6"" screen and to use with a backup camera. That part works great, but can purchase backup cameras alone for a fraction of the price I paid for this. Website listed in manual is wrong. Correct website is [...] but there is no contact information for support on the website."
1,slow and old maps,"this gps is to slow to get the signal out of satelite and the maps are too old like 2004 or so and here make new direccion almost every day and i try to coontact the atlantis custumer support and nobody answer my emails and calls, this is just suck gps the worst gps out..."
2,Failed after 1 year,"Easy to use, but ...This cyclometer failed after having gotten wet on a day that it rained. It no longer records the mph correctly, like some of the pulses are missing. The fork trasmitter and reciever batteries were replaced and realligned. I think it's durability is a little suspect."
2,Initial Pain to Setup,"I read the reviews and saw the complaints about the instructions but told myself, how bad can they be? Well, I wouldn't call them instructions at all. My biggest problem was setting up the sensor and the magnet. The pictures were were not any better. It's finally working I think and hope the pain is over from this point. A friend of mine got one by Sigma and he was happy with it."
3,Really nice but..,"If you also have the Nightrider Flight HID lighting system, this does not work because of radio frequency interference between these powerful lighting systems & a wireless computer.This probably happens with all of these HID light systems (Nightrider, Light & Motion, etc). See their webpages for details (the webpage will tell you the above).The lighting system shuts off the computer. Moving the computer away from the light works, but then I cannot see the computer as its pretty far away from the handlebars, mounted on the bike.I had to get a wired computer, which solved the problem."
2,Poor mounting system,"The Cateye MC100W is a very nice computer, but suffers from a poor mounting system. The mounting bracket is attached to the handlebar with two tie wraps. There is no way to tighten it enough to keep the computer stable. As a result pushing a button ofter requires two hands, one to hold the computer and the other to push the button."
2,Difficult to operate,"This is a reliable, nice, bike computer BUT the instructions are incomprehensible. CatEye should be ashamed as they have made bike computers for like 20 yrs.Their website is sleazy as well as I gave a fair review of the product and they then removed my review from their site after one week.A good product that is difficult to operate. My friends totally corroborate my conclusions."
4,Wireless signal interferes with GPS,"I love this thing, especially the manual start/stop function. I was really sad when I tried to use it alongside my DeLorme PN-30 GPS. All of a sudden the readings from the cateye were really sporadic. The GPS interfered with the wireless signal. They should add ""GPS"" to their list of transmitters/receivers that might interfere with the cateye. I'm going back to a wired computer, but I wish I didn't have to."
5,Good Deal Great Cyclocomputer,I bought this product about 3 months ago. I love it. It works perfectly I have no problem with interference with the wireless signal. It accurtly measures time speed and distance. I have no complants about this product I recomend it to anyone.
2,"great computer, lousy mount","First off, this thing works great. It was easy to install, a snap to get going, and it does everything advertised.The problem is that Cateye has paired this great computer with a really poorly designed clip that attaches to your bike's handlebar. After only a week of riding with it, the little tab that releases the computer body broke off. It is a small tab that is connected to the rest of the holder with only 2 tiny slivers of plastic. After a ride I punched it down and it popped off. The result is that the next time I went riding the computer flew off somewhere out there. Fix the holder and it would be great."
3,Many shortfalls,"This is a nice looking computer and it does what it needs to do, but the lack of an ability to take the mount on and off the bars (uses zip ties) is a pain. The battery also wore out a lot sooner than I expected and when I replaced it I lost all of my miles! The buttons are a little sticky too - they don't change the functions as easily as they should, especially when I'm wearing full gloves."
4,Good,"This album is a well arranged selection of quality Zappa work. Better than the first. Niether of these albums really give a well rounded history of zappa's work, but I don't think it's meant to do this. I don't think Zappa would think it was neccessary to honor him with a psuedo ""best of"" run through of his career, espeacially because the magnitude and diversity of his career makes it impossible to do so. I do think this is a nice collection for newcomers and patrons alike simply because I think it has nice order and fluency. FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOST THE MATERIAL THAT IS ON THESE DISCS ON OTHER RECORDINGS< DON""T BOTHER BUYING IT. Just make your own mixes as best you can, if you like. There is no cheap way to really get a grip of what Zappa was all about. Unless you go to emusic.com. OOpps. Gave it away."
5,Golden Nugget,"This is a little gem from the past. I was pleasently surprised to see a few songs from Danger Money on it. The Only Thing She Needs, Ceasar's Palace Blues and Carrying No Cross. Since this was recorded with the original line-up that means it's like hearing what Allan Holdsworth and Bill Bruford might of sounded like if they had stuck around for Danger Money. It's fun to hear those guys on those songs. The mixing is a little hinky though. It sounds like it might have been mixed live on an aux bus of a front of house mixer or something but that is not enough of a problem for me to take away from the joy of listening to this recording."
4,Reconsidering the rating.,"I stand by my prior comments, however, the 5 star rating is not appropriate considering the recording and comments."
2,SORELY-NEEDED REMASTER FINALLY AVAILABLE,"As you can see by the other reviews, the sound quality on this disc was never its selling point.However, a new 2007 Japan-only mini-sleeve version has been released. An excellent remastering job was performed, and now, it's a real live album that's actually enjoyable to listen to.The problem? All mini-sleeve CD's are limited edition, and the new edition is already sold out in Japan, and going fast elsewhere.So, if you want the best version of the only live document of this legendary band, you better get a-movin'.It will also be interesting to see what UKZ, Jobson's new iteration of UK, will bring in 2008. It's an awesome lineup (Jobson, Aaron Lippert, Trey Gunn, Alex Machacek and Marco Minnemann) with fantastic potential, but with Jobson involved, you never know what will happen.Link to the remastered version ofUK Live(now called ""Live In Boston"")."
4,Decent concert recording of original lineup,"For those who need more of UK in their original incarnation, this is one of few non-bootleg available. Not all that much different from the studio version, but still recommended."
3,Holdsworth needs to reel in,"I am insanely in love with the first U.K. album. Music craftsmanship at it's highest.Not so much with this album, however. I'm pretty good with 3/4 of the musicianship on Concert Classics. Sound is really not that bad.Allan Holdsworth, a great guitarist, is waaay too over the top. For some odd reason, he took the approach that, if three notes is good, 15 must be even better. I don't mind that occasionally but, generally, in music, less is more. In the mode of Edward Van Halen, he junks-up nearly every opportunity he gets to play on this album, when a few soulful notes would have been far more powerful and effective.And, like I said, I think he's a great guitarist and shines on the one UK studio album on which he plays. He renders the whole live album nearly unlistenable. Shame."
3,Liquid Trust,Product was smaller than expected. questionable as of the valuable of product as advertised.. Not sure if I would buy again.
4,What is it about pheremones?,"What can I say? The thing that works about them is the social confidence one gets. Placebo or real effect? For me, I don't care which, because it seems like fun. But, honestly, I tend to think, there's just enough effect to make it a really, really great placebo. Liquid Trust works as well as any of them, IMO. Magic, often, if you know how to look for it."
4,not too shabby,"I sprayed some on my middle-school aged child before he went to school. He said people did seem to treat him a little better (he's new and having some trouble). You can barely detect any odor at all. It's hard to tell when it wears off, but it seems some people do respond to it. I tried it once so far and my day went well. The real test will be on a job interview."
1,waste of money,"Ladies and gentlmen, do not waste your money on this product. First, it smells like rubbing alcohol, which it probably is, just put in a nice expensive bottle. And honestly, as far as social settings. I've noticed nothing better or worse. Guys, if you're having a hard time picking up women, dont try pharemones, work on your personality and self-confidece."
1,Liquid Trust,There are a lot of less expensive ways to achieve the same results. Try putting pure alcohol in an atomizer and spray it on. This is junk and does not work!
4,One of Goths best kept secret,Their first full-length album is the best I've heard in Gothic music for a long while.Actually I have a confession the album should be five stars..why I gave it four is that the album ended too soon!Go out and get it now.. Very close to sounding like Bauhaus but not quite...TBE has added their own touch to their sound...
3,Fascinating but how much of it is true?,"This book is Barbara Moore-Pateleewa's life story from her birth in 1905 near Saratov in Russia to the time the book was written in 1943. This book is an easy read and full of fascinating anecdotes about her life through the struggles of life in the early days of the Soviet Union when she trained as a doctor, through to her leaving the country just before the war. If all her stories are true then this is a remarkable journey, however, one wonders whether some of her tales, her 'fame' as a motorcyclist, her 'confession' to the head of the the GPU (forerunner of the KGB) and meeting with Stalin's daughter Krupskaya, etc., are not a little fantastical. After the book was written she went on to become an advocate of extreme food-fadism, the film footage of her grass diet are also fascinating to watch. A good read but to be taken with a bit of a pinch of salt, I think."
4,Nesmith is the man-hard act to follow,"""tapioca tundra"" and ""writing wrongs"" are giants. I need say no more. I'm a 26 year old male musician and composer. Done it my whole life. I am the harshest music critic in the world, and I'm telling you, The dude can write. Nesmith is a genius and one of the great artists of all time.-"
3,Not quite as good as the first four,"This CD has two bona fide hits: Valleri (their last top 10 hit) and Daydream Believer (their last #1). There are a few other good songs on here; of the rest, my favorite is probably ""Auntie's Municipal Court,"" a Mike Nesmith penned tune that is what Nez is, that is, strange.The Monkees had pushed Chip Douglas out the door by this time to produce on their own. Additionally, they each were moving in their own direction, leaving zero unity. In reality, from this point forward, nearly all Monkees albums are really best treated as ""various artists.""Again, that's not to say this CD is bad. It's not. However, it simply does not hold up to the previous four."
2,Monkee Mediocrity,"The wheels fell off the Monkeemobile with this disappointing follow-up to ""Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd."" (1967). Apart from the previously issued ""Daydream Believer,"" ""Valleri"" and ""Tapioca Tundra,"" The Monkees' fifth album was a directionless, forgettable affair. Peter Tork's conspicuous absence only emphasized the lack of group unity. Released a month after the TV series ended, ""The Birds, The Bees & The Monkees"" (1968) marked the beginning of the band's commercial decline. Happily, the ""Head"" soundtrack recaptured the Monkee spirit one last time."
2,Monkees come back down to earth,"This is the album that essentially torpedoed the group's career. Following the terrific ""Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones"" album, the Monkees turned in their weakest effort to date. The group would never again collaborate like on ""Headquarters"" and what you have here is basically each Monkee with his own cast of backup musicians churning out stagnant, unengaging music. The only salvation is Mike Nesmith, whose ""Tapioca Tundra"", ""Auntie's Municipal Court"" and ""Writing Wrongs"" showed his continued musical growth."
4,Time Has Been Kind To This Disc.,"The Birds, The Bees and the Monkees has always been an underrated entry in the group's catalogue. Released as they were falling from grace in the hip community, it was generally overlooked or scorned. Time has been pretty kind to the album, however. Mike Nesmith's decidedly strange contributions have a special, anything-goes, 60s charm. Once you get past the unsettling fact that the songs are solo efforts by each member --- sole exceptions: two Monkees on Auntie's Municipal Court and all four on Daydream Believer --- the disc works very nicely as a pop period piece.Bernard Perusse"
4,Monkees - Birds and Bees,"I bought this CD because I used to have the tape and I needed to replace it. It has some of the lesser well-known but excellent songs that the Monkees did, especially the song Zor and Zam."
3,The Beginning Of The End,"After the high quality of of PAC&J and the triumph of HEADQUARTERS,The BIRD,The Bees...is where it all start to slip. They started doing their own tracks,& no longer playing as a group,the album sounds unfocused and erratic.Theres no debating the merits of songs such as ""Aunties Manicupal Court"",""Zor & Zam"",""Tapioca Tundra""& ""PO Box.."",but like ""More of..""it all sounds slapped together.Even ""Daydream Believer""sounds out of place(it should've been included on PACJ from the get-go).Within half a year the Beatles will release ""The White Album""where four individual do their own songs under a group banner.In a rare instance The Monkees preceeded them.Not even Peter Tork appear on the album(except on the bonus tracks)."
2,"Just new Stereo remaster, BARE BONES RELEASE!","NO liner notes, not even a single foldout. Simply original 12 track album, STEREO MIX. Nothing else. No bonus tracks. Considering MONO mixes are mostly superior, the 3CD box of this album is actually a must have. For a new fan, I suppose this is ok. Yet the older RHINO CD release had great bonus material, as well as a nice multiple foldout booklet w pictures and essay. I'm sorry I opened it, was hoping for a new booklet. i'll just give it to a youngster to blow their little minds. (This review is of the new 2012 Rhino 'Flashback' series release. Exact same front and back cover of original CD, but no bonus tracks)"
3,Half and Half,"This CD is sort of half and half. The good songs were ""Auntie's Municipal Court"" ""Daydream Believer,"" ""Valleri,"" ""P.O. Box 9847,"" ""Zor and Zam,"" and ""The Girl I Left Behind me.""Mike's other songs were sort of weird, and ""Writing Wrongs"" was too long in my opinion.Davy's other songs were okay, but not my favorites.""Lady's Baby"" was better on Missing Links and ""I'll Be Back Upon My Feet,"" was better on Missing Links 2. I still can't figure out what that noise in the background."
3,The Beginning Of The End,"After the high quality of of PAC&J and the triumph of HEADQUARTERS,The BIRD,The Bees...is where it all start to slip. They started doing their own tracks,& no longer playing as a group,the album sounds unfocused and erratic.Theres no debating the merits of the songs such as ""Aunties Manicupal Court"",""Zor&Zam"",""Tapioca Tundra""&""PO Box.."",but like ""More of..""it all sounds slapped together.Even ""Daydream Believer""sounds out of place(it should've been included on PACJ from the git-go).Within a half a year the Beatles will release ""The White Album""where four individual do their own songs under a group banner.In a rare instance The Monkees preceeded them.Not even Peter appear on the album(except on the bonus tracks)"
2,Weak,"This was a weak album -- a disappointing follow-up to the superior 'Pisces' LP, and the end of the Monkees' artistic winning streak. There are several very weak Davy songs on this record (including some he co-wrote himself like 'Dream World' and 'The Poster'). These drag down the rest of the record, but there is plenty of blame to go around. Pretentious tracks like 'Zor and Zam' and 'P.O. Box 9847' ultimately don't have anything new to say. The two very good tracks, 'Daydream Believer' and 'Valleri' were actually recorded previously to this album's sessions, and seem to be included here to bolster a bad product -- it helps, but not enough. Although 'Auntie's Municipal Court' is decent, the sole original gem here is Mike's 'Tapioca Tundra' -- a weird, but very good Latin-influenced rock song. The bonus tracks are nothing special."
1,garbage,"two good songs: daydream believer, aunties municipal court. one song done better elsewhere: valleri. all the rest is either pathetic outtakes from their first albums which deserved to be left in the can, or ""artistic expressions"" like the unlistenable writing wrongs. i enjoy listening to the monkees, but really all you need is a 60 minute tape, taking great care to eliminate anything with davy jones unlistenable croak as a lead ""vocal"" (notable exceptions: the two above). sorry monkee fans: this album proves that these guys shouldve stuck to acting."
4,Bubblegum and Psychedelic,"An uneven mix of the group's bubblegum pop and psychedelic musings. I've always felt that ""Daydream Believer"" was a classic, mainly because of its theme of young married life. ""I'll Be Back Upon My Feet"" is a sly story about a guy who can't make a committment beyond a one night stand, while ""Valleri"" is pure pop froth."
2,Two hit singles and a load of filler.,"Probably the weakest album the Monkees realeased as a foursome. Adding the previously realeased hit singles ""Valerie"" and ""Daydream Believer"" gave this album some credibility, but after these two songs the quality of songs hits rock bottom. Mike sabotaged this album with some of his worst efforts ever to be recorded, and Peter is not even featured as a writer or singer. I am a huge Monkee fan, but even true fans know crap when they hear it."
3,"Great premise, but poor connection between the different characters","I really really wanted to love Cloud Atlas, because I love the premise of it, and the trailer looks excellent. The book isn't bad as such, but it is just so slow moving, and I was half-way through it before I really started caring about any of the characters - and just as you start caring about one character you move on to the next.The layout is interesting, and from a theoretical standpoint I really liked it, but in praxis it just didn't work for me."
1,Hard read,This book was not easy to follow and didn't really have a plot. I would not recommend this book to anyone!
3,Mulitfaceted Movie,"This story is multifaceted, but wonderful, just difficult to read as it threads from one place in time to anouther. Its like stading in front of an abstract painting, it takes awhile to see what the artist is actually trying to say."
2,Out of the Past and Into the Black (Coffee in Bed),"Weak. There are three (yawn) Rashomon-type narratives (vaguely incestuous brother and sister [Cocteau twin genus], alcoholic mommie dearest) concerning The Doctor, who is a very bad, and very one-dimensional, man. In between, there are these (very) li'l poetic vignettes concerning the Ghost and the Fairy that will make you cringe. This novel is bloody awful, but I gave it an extra star for the Sapphic sistahs in the third ""movement."" Much coffee is consumed hereabouts, sometimes at the Cambridge Starbucks. Ladies who lunch are featured. The prose is robotic, the narrative voices all like Hal 9000 on barbs. Laughable dialogue from The Doctor. The Corrections this ain't. Don't bother with it."
4,"Not her best, but worth reading","This is not her finest work, but well worth purchasing/reading. The characters are not empathetic, but the story is compelling, and it is a very quick read. Powerful, parts of it were disturbing - not so much because of what happens but because of the way the protagonist(s) deal with the events - I finished it very satisfied. It was well worth my time/money. Real fans will not be disappointed. Hopefully a new collection of short fiction or a selection of her non-fiction pieces from magazines, monographs, et cetera, will be forthcoming soon!"
2,Thoroughly Unlikeable,"I forced myself to finish this book b/c I try to read a book to it's last page no matter how awful the book may be. I guess I am hoping that at some point the book will get remarkably better. But, in this case it didn't. The three main characters are all very unlikeable and difficult to connect with. The story whines on and one never really engaging the reader. This book is going straight to the used book store. At least I'll get a couple of bucks for my wasted time."
2,So glad I only spent $6.00 for the hardcover!,"The jacket of this book leads you to believe there would be complex matters involved and quite differing points of views from the characters that all went through the same events of their years in ""the doctor's house"", however that's not the case. I was quite bored with the book as the characters never change, they never ""snap out of it"" and get a life. To me, it's all surface, no substance. Maybe Lifetime Channel could make a movie out of it."
4,Dysfunctional Families,"This novel is an authentic and well written story about a very dysfunctional family with real survivors. Beattie's writing is good, and she is able to create believable and likable characters the reader is always hoping will survive all the chaos."
2,NOT 'THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL',"I kind of had to force myself to read the whole book.Story told by a mother, daughter and son. The part as told by the daughter is confusing...very difficult to keep track of all her brothers love affairs. Story was all over the place.The part told by the mother is better, but not great.The son's story is more of the confusion that was in the daughter's story.Both adult children have distanced themselves from their unhappy, alcoholic mother and their insecure, unfaithful father. The father terrorized his family and the mother withdrew into her bottle and bedroom. The brother and sister clung to each other and were very close.Glad when I finally finished this book."
1,Back to my shrink,"This book made me want to scream or hit someone or (saddest) make another appointment with my old shrink, whom I finally got the courage to ""divorce."" It's Beattie at her worst and it don't get much worse than that."
2,Disappointing,"Where Book 1 was filled with mission information which was interesting reading, Book 2 is disappointing for the lack of the same energy. Book 2 just plods along. One problem with the Kindle version is that there are many spelling errors; ""the"" becomes ""die"", etc. This is probably due to the conversion process into the Kindle format, but it caused the flow to be very awkward. Didn't finish the book."
5,The cream between the cookies:,Kenn Miller is one of the finest military writers of the Vietnam era. This latest work by the author is an outstanding tribute to outstanding soldiers. He should be commended for the effort. Anyone that had a problem enjoying this book should stick with his comic books.
3,Good but not Great,"Ever since reading Gary Linderer's ""The Eye's Of the Eagle"", I have become very interested in LRRP action in Vietnam. I read both Linderer's book's on his tour in Vietnam and the three book series, ""Six Silent Men"". Out of the three books in the series this book is the weakest link. But it is still a great book that is well written but just not as well written as book one and certainly not as good as book three. It doesn't have the action and detail the other two have. But if you have any intrest in the LRRP's, I suggest this series of books and both books by Linderer."
5,Love it.,Got one for my 2004 PT Cruiser. with a little help from my wife it was a easy install. Fit and finish seem superior. Long term durability to be commented on later.
4,Burk's Presidential Families fo the USA,"I would like to know where they got their information, and is there more info on some of the presidents that is not written in the book."
5,A call to Action,"This book is hard to read as you try and fall asleep at night. Dale Peterson's vivid and disturbing account of the bushmeat crisis gives little comfort for those who would rather think of fun animals in the wild. What he documents is the decimation of both species and culture in a readable way. This book is a must for anyone who wants to understand how animal protection, conservation, economics, mendacity, and venality combining in the ruination of a species. I was gripped by the language and distraught by the images. Not an easy book to read, BUT an absolute must read, It is superb in detail and construct and will make a difference"
5,Still love this band,Loved them in the 70s and I still love them in the 2010's.Never get tired of this music.
1,Poor quality,"BNC connector was loose which caused intermittent video signal loss. Tried to use a compression tool, but the connection still failed to provide a constant signal. Returned this item."
3,"This is a useful book, but...","Loney and Theriault have put together quite a compendium of information about Oracle. I have created the command center database for my employer and used the tuning information many times. I did discover a discrepancy with the information relating to temp tablespaces. The book states that temp segments are constantly created, extended, and then dropped. The Oracle server documentation states that temp segments are not dropped, but continue to expand and are reused by multiple processes. This caused a great deal of confusion until we did more research. I find this book to be very useful otherwise, but would recommend crosschecking information (not just from this book but from any book) with a variety of sources when troubleshooting a problem."
3,It really depends on the reader...,"It is a good Oracle reference that covers well many aspects of day-to-day Oracle administration. It might be very good for beginners, but if you are an experienced DBA, there is not too much new information you can find here.There are no strong real-world examples, advanced or undocumented features in this book. Everything is 'standard' DBA stuff that you can easily find in Oracle's Documentation if you need a fast reference.Again, if you are a beginner-to-intermediate DBA trying to consolidate your knowledge, this book may be very appropriate for you. But if you already are an experienced DBA digging after 'something special' (you know what I mean), then you should look for something else (something like Oracle 24x7 Tips & Techniques)."
2,a gem from the old days,"They sure dont make movies like this anymore. This one used to play on tv once ina while. Its always fun looking at this one as they had made a giant monsterserpent prop so they could stick a actor/actress in its mouth when the creatureslowly devoured them. Its not a great movie, and its not that bad either and atleast they let you see their monster...even if it screeches a lot."
3,Uneven!,I was very disappointed in this cd. The quality is very uneven from song to song with too many of them at too high a key for Ms. Parsons voice. Her newer cd is much better and has already been listened to 10 times more often than this one.
4,"Great performance, ok song selection.","I have seen this band perform 4 times and can attest that their shows were HOT! The power of their live show can be felt on some of these songs but others lack energy. There are only 2 songs from the first album and 1 from the second, while 4 songs come from Citadel (3rd release). By this time the band started to abandon some of the musical adventurism for a more ""pop"" sound, probably the result of bad advise from record execs. Still this CD is well worth the price as some of the material burns, with the bass leading the charge. Twin guitar leads not unlike Wishbone Ash and Yes-like harmony vocals fill out the sound."
5,A great example of Starcastle's live performances,"This album showcases the Citadel tour. Most of the songs are from Citadel, with two songs from the first album, one song from the second and one song played only in concert. Starcastle is one of those bands whose live material is almost identical to the studio versions. This is hard to do. The harmonies are much better live than a lot of other harmonies-based bands who sing live. These two facts were a pleasant suprise to me when I saw them on their first album's tour. This album is no different. If you like Starcastle and have never seen them in concert, this CD will give you a good idea of what you missed. If you have seen them in concert, this will bring up good memories."
3,An Interesting Discovery,"As a Yes fan, I try to keep my eyes'n'ears open to discoverbands influenced by Yes. Mostly, the result is disappointing - onceyou find bands like this, something is missing. But Starcastle comes closer. It's more rocking and also more electronic (1970's synths) than Yes, and what's probably the most important thing is that Terry Lutrell has a very light voice like Jon Anderson, though not as skilled and bright as Jon Anderson's. Concert Classics - Volume 5 is a pretty good album. The highlights are Can't Think Twice and Lady Of The Lake. The reason why I ""only"" rate the album to 3 stars is that I can't help comparing Starcastle to Yes, and they do not reach the unique level of Yes!"
4,Another big-boned babe,"Big Bertha's little sister definitely has the bulky lines of the family, however the overall package is smaller. The Baby Bertha is just as nice a kit as the Big Bertha, but a cottage industry has sprung up around the baby. Excelsior Rocketry has come up with several ""Goony"" decal sets that allow you to turn the rather drab Baby Bertha into one of several inspired designs, most of which are based on old Estes classics. To date, I've built two, the Goony Max and the Goonybird Zero, based on the Excelsior decal sets, and two others that were direct clones of old Estes products, the Star Snoop and the Zoom Broom. Buy 'em by the bunch!"
5,easy to build,"my son and i had a great time putting this rocket together. we did not follow the color scheme at all and painted the whole thing red. at the hands of a five year old, i don't think this rocket will last too long but it was a fun and educational experience to put this rocket together... we just need to launch it and launch it soon"
4,A classic,This is a great looking rocket. Take a little time building it and painting it for a rocket unique to you! Flew great until I lost it in a pine tree on the fourth launch of the day. Looks good even there! Hoping to recover it still and send it up some more!
3,"Interesting, while different angle","This book is written by a successful manager of JAL and tries to explain especially the western business man, which paradigmas are used in the Asian area. You will recognize, that this book may is the first of this author. Also you have to keep in mind, that this book tries not to fully teach how to play the game go, although all necessary information (including examples) are included. The real reason is to show, that the paradigmas of Go can be used successful in business. I highly recommend this book everybody, who does business in Asia and likes to understand why agreement might be better than destroying."
3,Oh the toners of our lives,"In trying to save the company a bit of cash I am now listening to a low ""horse trot sound"" reminiscent of a horse parade down cobbled main street. The toner itself is working fine, but there is something not sitting right or jumbling around because it makes quite a bit of noise...never had that problem with previous cartridges. I may just have to go back to buying brand new/ non-recycled toner cartridge to save my sanity."
4,The Monkee's Finest Moment,"A perfect blend of the Monkees themselves and many of the studio players that provided the music tracks for their first two LP's. The group was undeniably talented,and this album has aged better that most of the ""important"" releases from that era."
3,music,Decent album. Wonder if there are others to preview I know of session tapes would be interesting to listen to.
5,great grandma,I loved this cd. It is one of the best the Monkees ever made. I am a big fan of Mike's and. Micky's and their singing together talents really come out in this cd
5,A combination of the best way of making music,"For the most part, Micky has put down his drumsticks for this one, though he did play on ""Cuddly Toy"" and there is speculation that he joined in on the drumming on the 2nd verse of ""Door Into Summer."" That said, the process may have changed from Headquarters, but not the result.This is a must have album for fans of sixties music. Beginning to end, this is a keeper. There is some experimentation here--the Moog makes its debut on an album on ""Daily Nightly""--but it is the Monkees production at its best. Don't miss this one.Album highlights include: Love Is Only Sleeping, Pleasant Valley Sunday, What Am I Doin' Hanging 'Round?, and Daily Nightly."
4,Probably the best Monkees record...,"This is probably the best of the original Monkees albums (It's a toss-up between this and 'Headquarters'). The highlights here are a handful of great songs with Mike Nesmith on lead vocal ('The Door Into Summer', 'Love Is Only Sleeping', 'What Am I Doing Hangin' Round?), a couple of good rocking lead vocals from Davy Jones ('She Hangs Out' and 'Star Collector'), and two hits (the great 'Pleasant Valley Sunday' and 'Words'). It's easy to see why these records were so popular in the 60's. This is great fun, and highly recommended."
1,Coleman 400watt cup style Power invertet PMP400XL,"Handily sits in car cup holder. Quiet in operation. However, it functioned for two weeks then constantly alarmed. A high piched screaming/whining noise. Except for the noise it failed to function. Fuse is okay, tried in other vehicles and with Fully charged car battery. Unit fails to function. I would like to strap the engineer who specified such a noisy alarm to a chair, where he could listen to the noise for a few hours as retribution."
2,A continous list,"Altough complete, updated and deep covering most of the aspect of clinical pathology, exposition of the matter is done in the list form, like a ""things to buy"" note. It looks like a student's lesson note and the subject is not treated in the usual way a book does, as say with sensed phrases that correlate one to the next following a logical thread. It is more a manual than a book and it is something that is impossible to read one paragraph after the other, and even harder to remember. Anyway it carries a lot of useful information and helped me whenever i needed."
5,moral fibre that prevails,This was a very enjoyable read. I really liked the old west setting for this action and intrigue story. The protagonist has a moral fibre that prevails throughout. Refreshing. Thire of the series of four.
5,"Wonderful Characters, Wonderful Book.","Before I read this book, I heard a mixture of why I should read it and why I should not read it. Before you get swayed from this book, understand that it is necessary to understanding Samuel Keaton.It starts when Sam discovers a dead body in his office. He immediately thinks someone is after HIS blood and he takes a scouting job for a young Leutinent. Not to give away too much, the expidition goes bad and Sam turns to whiskey. This book shows the love the other characters have for Sam and it shows how smart Doc. Harper is. It also shows that the smartes man has his weaknesses and how, with the right friends, you can rise from the ashes and move on with your life."
4,Too often the U.S. government becomes the people's worst enemy.,"""After Shock"" was a well written book of the disaster genre. I enjoy this type of book - and movie - but so many examples are thrown together or don't make logical sense. I'm definitely not a scientist but the science seemed to make sense and work in this book.Character development is usually not a strong point in this type of book - the disaster itself is the main protaganist. But ""After Shock"" had some likeable characters, a little romance. I liked that much of it took place in Alaska -different.All around, a good solid read with a lot of science and acronyms but a lot of action, too."
3,a mystical heart: 52 weeks in the .....,I was a little disappointed in this book. I think I expected more of thoughtful writing to challenge my thinking. the poetry is beautiful and does have a beautiful way of stating things but I am more of a prose person at heart. I liked the quotes that precede each poem and it was nice but not what I had expected.
2,I only read it because I was required to.,"This was a required reading for an online course I needed in order to teach onlne courses. The buzz-word in the course and in the book is ""asynchronous collaboration"" which translated means ""group work when the group is never in the same place at the same time."" A lot of educationists are vested in distance learning; they want to prove it is at least as good as, if not better, than classroom teaching. This book certainly falls into this mold. Every time the author sites a person or study that is critical of distance learning, he refutes it by citing his own opinion."
4,A Surprisingly Great CD!,"This is really my Dad's CD, but I burned a copy of it for myself. I'm 16, but I really enjoy this CD (call me crazy!) We first heard it when my Godmother played it on one of our annual sojourns to the magnificent Bass Lake. It's a really fun collection of jazzy hits. This is a really good CD! I love it! Even though I can't understand any of the words, I still love it. My favorite song is Track 2, ""Vai De Vez"". This CD was really hard for us to track down, because we kept seeing CD's that we thought were this, but turned out not to be. This is a must-have for any CD collection. It's awesome, even for the younger generation, like mine. Enjoy!!!"
4,"Very nice, not spectacular","This CD is like a cubist painting -- it takes the basic elements of classic Bossa Nova sounds, and twists/remixes/re-composes them into a new whole. The original is still recognizable, but the remix is a new work of art with its own twist. My only problem is that I think to appreciate this you have to like both the old and the new -- if you like this kind of dance music in general, but don't know the originals, would you really appreciate what is going on here? I don't think so. I think the ""Red Hot in Rio"" album, which is also an album of modern versions of Brazilian classis, appeals to ""new music"" ears much more effectively in this. You can appreciate ""Red Hot in Rio"" even if you don't know the originals. This album, on the other hand, is best appreciated if you have a foot firmly planted in the old with another foot firmly planted in the new."
1,Bossa Nova Graveyard,"A great disappointment. I have love Bossa Nova for more than ten years and after reading the hype I was really interested to hear what the new generation of musicians has made of some of the classics. The answer is not very much. Firstly most of these arrangements are not new at all, they are what you might expect from the Hilton Hotel Lobby Band with their characteristic lack of everythingness. The arrangements which are new sound unsympathetic to me. What's the point of simply adding a few computer generated noises over the backing track? The whole project lacks imagination - its only positive feature is that it makes the originals sound even better"
3,Surprising Bossa Nova with a techno twist- Spicy Rhythms,"I love Bossa Nova and expected a re-mix to be a desecration of the Brazilian originals- however, I'm glad to report, I was wrong. This CD of ""reconstructed"" classics is innovative, yet, it respects the traditional genre. They didn't just add drum machine tracks and synth. These new arrangements are hip interpretations and quite listenable. Check the ""Maria Moita"" clip first for a great intro to this CD, and for you traditionalists, listen to ""Meditacao."" It will surprise you, but it is well done. Folks who are interested in Brazilian music should give this a listen, just to keep current. Even if you're not crazy about these interpretations, you have to give these folks credit for using outstanding musicians, and you have to admit, it takes the music in directions you never would expect."
5,A Refreshing and UPBEAT new mix of classic samba,"Ohhh man, is THIS a fun CD! What this group of multi-talented artists have done with classic Boss Nova songs is taken their original beat and infused them with extremely modern sounds like techno and calypso to create a toe-tapping, mind-bending experience. These songs are perfet for dancing and or daydreaming of the Caribbean, and as an added bonus, for all those DJs out there, a sampler of salsa beats are included for looping. Muy bien!"
3,Generic Latin Lounge,"Fairly indistinguishable Latin lounge music. Pleasant enough songs, but a rather monotonous CD. I like flavor and creativity with my Latin lounge. This CD contains all the requisite sounds for, but the end result is something altogether flavorless."
4,Excellent Nu World Bossa Nova...,"I love how these three DJs modernize Bossa Nova by adding new beats... My favorite track is ""Maria Moita"" and I love the vocals on mostly all tracks... I definitely recommend any nu world dj pick this cd up... It's guaranteed to be a hit - Savannah Skye..."
1,Bossa Nova Desecration!!,"I've loved Bossa Nova Music since 1962, and this polluted, distorted, convoluted trash is severe insult to Bossa Nova and all that it stands for. I wouldn't give a dime for this CD. It's WACK!"
3,Not as good as the syrup used by Duncan Donuts,Good but a bit too sweet and not as good as whatever it is tht Duncan Donuts uses to make coconut coffee
4,Excellent introduction to the world of qawwali music,"Before seeing this film, I had never heard nor read about this type of music and the culture behind it. At the beginning I was a bit sceptic, but after a while I really enjoyed it, and I quite liked the music. Being a stranger to the culture and religion of the Middle East, I was amazed about the high status given to this music within the religious environment. In my view this film is a good introduction to qawwali music and I recommend it to everybody curious to learn more about other cultures and religions."
2,After 18 months I have a radio player,I wanted to be writing a favorable review after 18 months but the cd and tape player quit working at the same time. Now I have a 70 dollar radio. The battery life has always been good. The sound has always been average. Does anyone make a dependable cd player?
3,Mega Bass doesn't make a difference,"I had my old Sony Boombox for 11 years & it finally gave out. I saw this one; it looked nice and had all the same basics as my old one. I needed a simple player & this one fit the bill. Many others look too ""space age"" to me.When I got it, I put in a CD and it didn't sound like it had much bass. I turned on the Mega Bass & it didn't sound any different. At least with my old Sony you could tell when the Mega Bass was on. Because of the lack of bass I think it's an OK player.I took my children to a local play gym/arcade, and they had the Sony CFD-F10 there. It sounded great! Sad to say, it makes me wish I did a little more comparing, the extra $10-$15 dollars seems worth it."
1,"liked it, until the cd player stopped working","Only had it for 6 months and already it won't play my cd's, so now it's basically a very overpriced fm radio, with relatively poor reception on many stations. Very annoying. I expect more from Sony. This is the only Sony boombox I have tried. I have a Philips at home, which I've had about 8 years and still works like a charm."
2,Works great ... while it works.,"This is the second Sony portable CD player I've had that played fine until just after the warranty expired. In both cases, the CD player at first started skipping, then refused to play or recognize CDs. This is not a dust or cleaning issue, but a problem with the manufacturing that apparently either causes the optics to go out of alignment, or the motor to spin either at the wrong rotation rate or at a variable rate. (I guess it could also be a problem with the stepper motor that moves the optics in and out to follow the tracks.) No matter the cause, I won't buy another Sony CD player. Shame they bought Iawa too, because now I can't trust that brand either.I spent about 15 years servicing industrial and broadcast audio and video equipment, and what one engineer said (somewhat jokingly) then applies now: ""Sony products are great, as long as they have no moving parts."""
1,Big disappointment.,"I bought this after my little Emerson cd player bit the dust. The Sony product cost more, but had mostly good reviews, so I spent a bit more to get it. Big mistake. From the get go, the sound quality is lousy compared to the cheaper Emerson. The Mega bass provides a different type of sound distortion, not necessarily preferable to the sound without it. After playing fewer than ten cd's, it began showing the message, ""no disc"" when I try to play a cd. Pfft. Worthless. I'm buying another little Emerson. Will keep the Sony around as I like to have a tape player for the occasioanl casette. Hoping the tape player holds up longer than the cd player did."
1,Disappointing functionality,"I ordered this unit specifically because I wanted a cassette player (I have lots of old cassettes that I listen to regularly) with a remote control, becuase I listen to the cassettes in bed. Imagine my disappointment when I got it and found that the remote does not operated with the cassette function, only with the CD and radio!"
5,Hot Flash Insomnia life saver,"I listen to Audio books on CD's at night to help me deal with insomnia associated with hot flashes. What's important to me is can I use the controls in the dark, without turning the light on. I have learned how to push the correct buttons without being able to see the controls, and I have noticed there is a bump on the 'play' button, which helps me to orient my fingers. The sound is fine. It's a little big for my nightstand, but It serves my purpose nicely. If you like to be read to sleep at night it will work for you!"
1,Save Your Money,"Shoddy describes this product. I used to trust the Sony brand but no longer. I bought this player, but the cassette buttons stuck and did not function properly. I returned it but the same model replacement also had stiff buttons. I ended up keeping it because I was going camping & wanted to play my audio tapes. The buttons on this one began sticking about four months later. Now I can use it if I use a knife to pry the play button up & manipulate the rewind button. Also the CD player stopped working before the the year was up, although it only had light usage."
1,I should have bought a cheaper boom box.,"Bought it for my classroom. I had hardly used it before it wouldn't read CDs... ""No Disk""... ""No Disk""... ""No Disk""Other teachers' boom boxes were a lot cheaper, and they're still working!"
2,Cd player stopped working,"Bought this for my wife and it worked fine for about 1 year. Then the CD player would not recognize CD's, neither commercial ones or ones burned at home. I have seen a pattern in CD players of using a poor design for the player. Rats."
4,Transaction worked out very well,So far the product has worked well. It was a gift and have not heard any complaints. The delivery was timely and packaged well.
2,cheap,"Worked ok for a while, sounds average. Problem is the CD door broke off its hinge and now I can't play CDs as it needs to be tightly closed to play a CD. This was not unusual usage either, the door is poorly made."
2,Disappointing but no,"A gift to replace another sony boombox that did not last, would not have been my choice, but I was hopeful. Returned the first one, too often told me it could not read a CD other machines could. The second lasted nearly two years of light duty, the CD player quit and didn't work well after a year. I expected better but my midrange sony DVD/VCR lasted about the same. No longer a name for quality and longevity."
3,Does the Job Fine for Us,"We've had this Sony boom box with CD player for somewhat less than a year; we use it, for perhaps an hour, a couple of times a week, to practice our dancing down in the party room. We also use it on occasion in the living room, because the big sound system is just so burdensome to use just to listen to one or two disks. Our previous boom box/CD player, by another company that we thought we could trust, died in less than a year; that's why we bought this one. I note that other reviewers find this product is poorly made, but so far, we've been happy with it. And, more to the point, everywhere we go, I see people using this brand and model machine; seems to me therefore, that they must be satisfied with it, as we are. But I'll get back to you if it dies in a year."
4,"NOT a boombox, but worth the $50.00","I finally broke down and bought this unit a couple of weeks ago. I use it at low volumes, while out with my daughter at the park, or at night to go to sleep to. If you are looking for a BOOMBOX, look elsewhere. The Sony XPLOD is a very good choice at around $100.00. But the XPLOD is hardly what I would consider portable, as it weighs 21 pounds without the 8 D batteries installed. The CDF-S350 is about what you can expect for fifty dollars. Target has had it on sale for $49.95."
2,I love my Sony CD/Radio-It's so Portable!,My new Sony CD/Radio is wonderful! It is so portable-never a hassle to move it from space to space!Thank you- and such a value! jan
1,"JUNKY PERFORMANCE, FROM AN AEROBICS INSTRUCTOR","I BOUGHT THIS ATTRACTIVE, SONY (THINKING QUALITY) BOOM BOX TO PLAY CD MUSIC DURING THE CLASSES I TEACH IN WATER AEROBICS.THE FIRST TIME I USED IT, IT WOULD JUMP AROUND ON THE CD.THE SECOND TIME I USED IT, IT JUST STOPPED PLAYING. ONE OF THE CLASS PARTICIPANTS SAID SHE ALSO FOUND THIS PRODUCT TO BE INFERIOR AND HAD GIVEN IT TO HER GRANDCHILDREN TO PLAY WITH.I AM RETURNING MINE FOR THE LARGER, UGLIER SONY BOOM BOXES. WHAT A WASTE OF TIME THIS PURCHASE WAS!"
2,"Great sound, but poor quality construction!","I got this to listen to books on tape both CD and cassette. At first I was very happy due to the great sound. I was ready to order another one. Then less than a week later, the play button on the cassette player wouldn't work. I called Sony and they said I would have to mail it back so they could check it out. I asked if there was a local place to bring it and they said no, you just have to mail back (at my expense). I am just going to return it to the place I purchased it and look for another sturdier model Very disappointed. Hope I can find another model that has CD/cassette and possibly MP3 that has a decent sound and that I can have for a while without it breaking down. Disappointed in Sony as I always thought Sony was so great."
2,CD player stops working,"The sound quality is good and the remote and sleep features are really handy. I don't like that shuffle-repeat mode isn't randomized; it shuffles then replays in the same order. You have to open the CD lid and close it again then re-select shuffle-repeat to reshuffle in a different order.The deal-breaker, though, is that the CD player stopped working -- twice. I've gone through two of these radios in three years; in both cases the CD player quit working after about 18 months. The player simply won't read the disk. From looking at reviews of other Sony products, this is a brand-wide issue. I won't be buying another Sony radio."
5,Sony CFD-S350 Boom Box,"I was very happy with its perpormance. It records very well from radio &CD onto cassette. Sound was very good. The only problem I found was identifying the correct button to fast forward ,rewind,play etc. in a dimmly lit room, the markings on the buttons were the same color as the buttons , but outside of that I was a very pleased with the product"
3,CFD-350 Sony boombox,"THe CFD-350 Sony boombox that I receieved was new and it worked fine! However, the quality of many sony company products and parts however has deteriorated as has everything else that is not made in the U.S.A or Japan wt. better and sturdier working parts!! I have the cfd-250 sony boombox from before and the parts, espcially the cassette tape keys etc... are wayyyy better quality than the CFD-S350 that was probably made in china wt. cheaper parts! So far the CFD-350 works fine but don't know how long it will last, before the cheaper quality parts break down??"
4,Still a great boombox,"I've been using Sony boom-boxes for years. The CD units on two finally quit working, so I purchased two new units.Sony has made major changes. The functions have been placed on the remote, and are a little more complicated but still fine. The sound is still very good, the radio reception is not so great but still OK.The body has been redesigned and the CD lid is now more oval than square. There is more stress on the hinges, and I have to be careful when I close the lid, or the hinges become misaligned. The old lid could be closed easily, since the square shape lined the bottom of the lid with the hinges."
4,Sounds Fine,"I bought this boom box to replace a 15 year old Sony that stopped playing CD's. Despite some negative reviews on the sound quality, I took a chance for 60 bucks. The sound quality is better than expected and better than my old Sony box. This player can hit decent volume without distorting. The Megabass feature does make a difference, adding some bottom and definition to bass guitar and bass drum tracks. It should just be called ""Bass"" though as there is nothing ""Mega"" about it. I guess some reviewers were expecting the bass of an 80's ghetto blaster and were disappointed. I have not tried the radio nor the tape feature to give any opinion on those, but as a portable CD player, this Sony boom box sounds fine and is great for the price. The remote control is a terrific plus."
1,Arrived broken/ poorly packaged,"The cd player arrived broken, with a dent in front. It was packaged very poorly (no bubble wrap and lots of space to move around in the box). Incredibly disappointed."
2,Not Worth the Money,This is an outdated boom box. It has no auxiliary jack the CD player doesn't play MP3s and the sound is OK quality. This Stereo's tape deck and antenna broke quickly as well. I would recommend you find another boom box. It's one redeeming quality is that it is very loud.
4,Good stuff!,"Product looks good, controls and transport/play systems seem solid. Good sound. Remote control extremely useful. Downside is that radion reception is very poor, but that is probably due to power/data lines running near the box. In short, at this point (30 days ownership and use) I'm quite satisfied. It's FAR better than the previous RCA unit which I bought, and had to return twice, the second time for a refund."
5,Love This Box,"This is the second one I bought - one for home and one for the light exercise gym class I teach. Am able to use some of my favorite tapes and switch to newer CD's quickly. And the remote works like a charm. The radio's a plus, too."
2,CD player malfunction,Radio plays okay....CD player stops playing in middle of CD after owning for about a year.For that reason I would not recommend ...think I read a similar review here.
2,Poor Sound Quality,"The sound is muffled and poor fidelity. The preset stations are cumbersome to setup and use. You cannot see the LCD display screen in the dark, and also the buttons.It was a great disappointment. All the other Sony products I have bought are great."
4,Bought this almost 4 years ago and still love it,"We bought this boombox for my son's room soon after he was born. I love that it has a remote. Being able to adjust the music from the rocking chair while rocking my son to sleep was great. We use this boombox every night and often during the day as well. We've been very happy with the durability of this item (it's done well through 3 moves) and the sound quality. The only thing I would change about this unit is it's size. Although we've never had a problem placing the boombox on the dresser or shelf of my son's room, it does take up more space than I'd like. That won't stop us from buying a second one for my daughter's room, though."
2,Boom box with no boom,"I didn't keep it for very long so I cannot review the battery life. It has average sound quality but it's shape is larger than necessary for the small speakers inside. Has rather weak, shallow sound."
4,Sony CFD-S350 CD/Cassette Portable Boombox,Looks good. Seems like a tight machine except for the cover. I worry that it may not be as durable as it should be. Top isn't immediately responsive with light finger pressure (to open lid). I don't like to push hard as it seems that these products aren't as durable as those of earlier manufacture. If the lid holds up then I'd give this a 5 star rating. Don't use batteries in it now so I can't rate its use of such. Love the remote control feature. Sound is great. Bass feature is a bit weak but I like less heavy bass so I'm happy with the range. Clean sound production. Nice range of volume.
2,Disappointing Sony Product,"We have always received good quality for price from Sony. The cassetteplayer simply does not work properly. The play and eject/stop buttonsregularly jam, making it hard to use. I don't recommend this product. Theonly reason that we are not returning it is the difficult return process, i.e.,contact the seller, obtain return authorization, stand in line at the USPS orUPS."
5,Purchased as a Christmas gift. Recipient LOVED it; got great reception in an area where this is difficult.,"I purchased this item as a gift from my brother to my sister-in-law. She loved it! Her ""up north"" house is in PA and reception is not generally good. This player worked great!"
5,Worth the money,This Sony CFD-S350 may cost a bit more than some of the competition but I think its quality is worth it.
5,Excellent Item,I found this to be of very high quality. The bass is too good and sound clarity is very good too.
5,CD/cassette player,"I bought this as a gift, It is great....easy to operate and has great sound. I would recommend this item."
1,do not purchase,"I purchased this (9/08) for my new baby to help her fall asleep. The tape deck did not work from the beginning. Later I pushed the play button down really hard and it played tapes for a few minutes or so and stopped working. I was busy with the baby and didn't care that much about the tape player anyway. It was more important that the cd work. The cd player was working fine until three weeks ago. Now it will not play any cd's. Now that we have broken the sleep time routine, my baby will not fall asleep and I am extremely frustrated. The item should not stop working after 5 months. I purchased this item due to the good reviews. I spoke to Sony today and they said I would have to pay $31 for a replacement unit. I paid $77 total at amazon and should not be asked to pay another $31 for a unit that should still be working. I posted a complaint at sonysyle.com which is all that I can do. Hopefully Sony will send another unit - I will post an update if that happens."
2,Sony Boombox S-350 problems,"I received a Sony CDF S350 for Xmas, and thought that with the remote control device, it would be just what I needed. However, after a few weeks, the lid over the cd wouldn't stay down, and now when I push hard enough to make it stay, the screen says ""No CD"". Also, the tone on bass setting is really not different."
2,CD player spins and won't play,"Very disappointed with this quality issue on a Sony product. The CD spins and spins but will not play, it comes back with an error display of ""No Disc"". This is the second unit this has happened to . I managed to exchange the first one inside the return period, but this replacement has failed in the identical way 3 months after the warranty. I liked the features ok, but it is useless to me now without a working CD player. Not what I expected from a Sony.Sony CFD-S350 CD/Cassette Portable Boombox (Silver)"
4,Sony CFD-S350 CD/Cassette Portable Boombox,The CFD Boombox is a good value for the cost. Sound quality is good. Light weight and easy to handle. Radio tuners are sensitive but easy to tune.
5,excellent service,"The boombox is exactly what I expected. I have an earlier model that has been terrific, so I expect this one to be like it but improved. The remote is clearly an upgrade and very practical. The delivery service was phenominally fast."
2,MegaBass actually means No Bass,"It could also mean: ""I wish I had bass, where's the bass, Sony doesn't know what bass is"" etc...What's also sad is that the midrange and highs are almost perfect; but these features aren't hyped like the ""MEGABASS"". So to be accurate Sony DOES know what bass is; they just totally removed from this model and placed it perfectly in the CFDG700 CP model (XPLODE). And for a few extra dollars to get one of the best sounds compared to one of the most lacking sounds in a boombox is well... just...the easiest decision you'll make in shopping."
2,poor tape player,I have bought two Sony boomboxes in a year and a half (I listen to books on CD/tape). The tape player has given out on both of them within months of buying it.
4,Great CD-Tape copies,"This unit makes very good quality cassette copies of CDs, which is important in my work as a missionary in Africa. Most other units I have tried add a terrible hiss to the audio CD."
4,Great!,"My son has this boom-box, and has left it out in the rain several times. It still works through all he's put it through, including the rain and dropping it."
3,Not as great as the hype,"I bought this thinking it would be a really great value. The sound is hollow; ""MEGA"" bass is a joke. AND, the thing that really is a bummer is that you don't have the option to play your CD's with the random/repeat functions. I would not buy this again if given the choice."
3,Not worth the money,"I got this boombox couple of weeks back and it seems to work fine. But I felt that this does not live upto the level of Sony. The sound quality is ok, but not very impressive. There is an option of Mega Bass Boost in this one, which does not seem to work, there is no appreciable change in the sound quality with/without Mega Bass Boost. Overall its not worth the money.I sincerely feel that there are boomboxes out there with same performance as sony but much much cheaper."
5,One of the funniest Performers out there.,"Stephen Lynch was Variety Playhouse in Atlanta on 11/05/2005, I bought my copy of this album from the show. As with his previous albums this one was from start to finish funny. Again, I'm thrilled to have it in my collection."
3,A funny Listen,I bought this right after I watched Mr. Lynch on thr Comedy Channel. I thought that I was buying the DVD and not a CD. Still I am not disappointed. For those of us with a twisted sence of humor it's perfect.
5,Outlandish!,"Stephen Lynch is the simply the most irreverent comedian in the world. He leaves no topic uncovered. This is not for the easily offended, but it is incredible."
1,Thin thin thin,"This towel is very thin and not soft at all. Save your money, go to Linens N Things and buy one you can touch first for probably less money."
2,"3M POLYESTER PUTTY,( without hardener ?)","PRODUCT WAS EXCELLENT,PRICE WAS VERY REASONABLE. THERE WAS NO HARDENER INCLUDED IN PURCHASE,THIS WAS LIKE PURCHASING SHOES WHICH REQUIRED SHOES LACES BUT NOT INCLUDED.AFTER BUYING HARDENER & SHIPPING WAS NOT THAT GREAT OF A PURCHASE AS PROMOTED TO BE.VERY DISSATISFIED & TURNED OFF BY PURCHASING IN FUTURE FROM AMAZON."
3,a little raw,"I am an elementary school librarian. This book came with an Accelerated Reader set, and the cover tipped me off that I should read it, before giving it out. I am very glad I did.I don't have a problem with the language; it is realistic. I don't have a problem with the subject matter, either. But this is NOT a book for 9-12 year olds, in my opinion. It is wrenching, and frightening, and very raw.I would have no problem putting this on a middle-school shelf, and I think it would be wonderful on the high school shelf for high-interest low-ability reading...but for elementary school? Totally inappropriate."
1,Appalling,I too am an elementary/junior high librarian. I purchased thisbook because I was looking for a sensitive portrayal. This book is awful! The language really gets in the way of the story. I could only conjur up prejudicial images of a hick town. I was also very shocked at the treatment of the ending. There were no real consequences. There were no adult characters that the children felt they could trust...I finished this book and threw it in the trash.
2,Beware of offensive language and mature subject matter,"Dimple's aim is to get even with the boy who accidentally shot and killed her brother, according to the reports. The story goes through the process of Dimple finding out about the shooting, the funeral home, and the funeral. Dimple leaves the funeral to pay a visit to the boy who shot her brother, and has plans to ""not delay the payback"". She finds out the truth at his house just prior to a close call.This book is for mature readers only because of gruff language, poor English and because Dimple exhibits language typical of the insensitive and rude character she is. Also, the subject matter is very mature."
1,this cd s@@@s,"i am a big fan of the strawbs. but, DON""t buy this live cd. this makes the group sound pathetic. their music deserves better than this miserable live recording. i would be glad to sell you mine. stay away it is dreadful."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is the worst ""how to"" DVD I've ever watched. The quaility is very poor, from the misspelled ""horsese"" on the cover to the grainy picture quality and so-so sound quality. There is about 15 minutes worth of helpful desensitizing excercises and the rest is just more of the same over and over again. Nothing on tying, trailering, or any of a hundred other things you need to know to give your colt or filly a good start in life. It is not worth the price. Heck, it's not worth 1/2 the price!"
2,On the way out,"This Torkless late album features a hilarious number (""Ladies' Aid Society""), a decent Nesmith track (""Listen to the Band"") and an odd version of ""Pillow Time"" which song we also heard Mickey improvising in a bonus track on ""Headquarters."" Otherwise this is pretty forgettable stuff, with too many country/western ditties and lightweight fluffers."
1,This is a joke Right?,I'm sorry I got this cd. They lost their great musical abilites after Pete left. They didn't grow as a band by any means at all. I don't know how much time was spent in the studio but I don't think a lot was. The band was already crumbling by then cause they weren't getting along with Mike. Anyway I think after Pete left that should have been the last of the monkees.
4,Great late period Monkees album.,"Each remaining Monkee contributed worthy material to this album. Mike wrote ""Listen to the Band"" and ""Good Clean Fun"", both very good tunes. Mickey came up with ""Mommy and Daddy"" which is a classic. Davy sang a great lead on ""Looking For the Good Times"" and ""French Song"". Overall, this is a very entertaining and mature outing for the guys. Too bad the public never gave it much of a shot."
2,Inconvenient Format,"Those seeking copies of the three Trumbull books on covenant will be disappointed that this CD-ROM provides facsimiles only that can neither be searched nor printed. You cannot copy and paste to a word processor. The sometimes crookedly scanned Trumbull books can be read on your computer screen; that's it. All the books on this CD are combined in one large, locked PDF file. If having all these works together in one file for occasional reference on-screen is what you seek, this CD will work for you."
4,CLASSIC JEEPS REVIEW,"THE AUTHOR USES NOT ONLY THE FACTUAL HISTORY OF THE JEEP IN WWII AND HOW IT CAME TO BE,BUT ACTUALLY TRIES TO ILLUSTRATE THE UNIQUE RELATIONSHIP THAT EXISTS BETWEEN JEEPS AND THEIR OWNERS AS WELL AS THE WHOLE JEEP EXPERIENCE.THE BOOK IS LARGER THAN MOST,DISPLAYING SOME OF THE MOST COLORFUL LARGE PHOTOS OF OLD AND NEWER JEEPS IN ACTION AS WELL AS TRUE ART FORM.A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE WHO UNDERSTANDS THE ""JEEP THING"""
3,Classic Jeeps book,"I bought this for my husband, who is a Jeep fanatic, and he likes it very well. He loves the pictures and history, and the fact that it ends with his Jeep model! I felt that the book did not warrant the steep price. I expected a bigger, sturdier, better-looking book suitable for the coffee table. The cover looks cheap and was warped when we got it. If you are more interested in the content than the appearance, this is a great book, but if you are buying it for a gift, I was not happy with the value."
1,WARNING: Do not buy,This card have drivers troubles in windows XP. Some fixed with SP2.But His bigger trouble is that Creative Labs refuse to provide drivers or all class of support because is a OEM product.Creative says that the customer must obtain support from the manufacturer.The manufacturer is impossible to find.
4,"A product being phased out, but still has game","While this product is being faded out with the new Audigy line, there is still a quality sound card here. If you don't have the speakers to support the 5.1 or 6.1 you are better off with this card."
4,3.5 out of 5 - good rockabilly,a good release of their earlier material. a bit uneven at times with some great tunes and some mediocre-dragging tunes (claim jumper blues). 3BT have more of a neo-rockabilly sound with some songs bordering on psychobilly. not for RAB purists but if you like a band that plays hard and fast with lots of energy this is a good one to get. the songs have a twang to them but are not nearly as western as their later stuff becomes.
4,Just what I needed,"While it is true that eBay has all this information online, I spent hours there this monring just trying to find out the simple information in the booklet. EBay should have something like this available on their site for those just wanting the basic facts.A few more pages on the selling side would have made it better for my uses, but now that I know the basics,I can skip all that."
1,all the info you can find on ebay,Nothing new in this book. If you go to any help page on ebay you can find this information not worth the time or money
3,Very well written practical information but not the way to learn ebay,"This was a very well written quality booklet, but in our opinion the best way to learn to sale on Ebay is not through a book, but through a course where someone can guide you step by step and be there to answer questions if you get hung up.How to Create a $5,000 Monthly Income with Ebay and Online Auctions"
5,The best.,This book is very good for my study of Pauline Letters. Thansk to the Author and service of Amazon!
3,Exhaustive,A bit wordy for my taste. Also doesn't seem to resolve some of the critical issues he raises.
2,Good information... not quite what I was looking for,"This book is definitely for someone wanting an ACD show dog. Very detailed as to the requirements for the AKC requirements. The history of the ACD is good, but overall, I was a little disappointed in the overall content of the book and didn't feel that it really helped me understand the responsibility of owning an ACD."
3,A decent first owner manual,Most of this book contains some information that a first time owner would find useful. I would have like to see some more information in the behavior section and on the breed characteristics. I did find it appalling that they said some owner considered euthanasia an option for some overly agressive dogs (What kind of dog person writes that in their book).
5,a must,i read my first John Carter book when i was 12 years old; i am considerably older than that now and still enjoy re-reading them; a must for anyone who likes good story telling with the added dimension of science fiction - science fiction that was remarkably advanced for its time
2,takes the curl out of my hair :(,"I bought this after reading all the positive reviews. While it is REALLY sudsy stuff so a little goes a long way, it leaves my hair LESS curly and limp. I've been using it daily for over a month now. So sad I bought multiple bottles, don't know what to do with them."
2,disappointed.....again!,"I'm a really big fan of Ani Dr Franco. She's an awesome musician and obviously a great live performer. So I keep wanting a dvd of her in a live performance. I bought ""Render"" first and now ""Trust"" and unfortunately got the same thing both times. I got ""ART""...instead of art. Trust (like Render before it) is much less a real performance tape than some kind of self-indulgent excercise by someone (Danny Clinch and Ani I guess) in ""filmmaking"". Trust might be a little better that Render in this regard..but not much. After one viewing I'm now like the other reviewer of Trust who just listens to the music playing without watching. It's too frustrating to watch because what I really want to see is Ani Di Franco singing and playing the guitar...not politics...not ""ART""...and not ""CINEMA"". Ani, Please try again and just PLAY!"
2,something's missing,"oh yeah, its Mike and Peter. Changes was the last Monkees album to be released before their reunion in the 1980s. When this album was released the band couldn't sell food to a starving man they were so unpopular. It's a dreary album , not because the songs are crap, they're not, It's the usual top-shelf writing teams that wrote em', but it's the knowledge that it's not the full-boat Monkees, not even the 3/4 Monkees. An ongoing joke around the studio was that one member would finally milk the well dry with an album entitled ""The Monkee""....""hey hey I'm the monkee...."" Today ""changes"" is purely an album to own to make a cataloug complete for a collector."
3,Monkees' Swan Song,"With Mike Nesmith having left the group, the two remaining Monkees released one more album as a duo. This album is just like their first two with Jeff Barry playing the role of Don Kirshner. Barry production and songwriting are bubblegum perfect but the album lacks any feeling. ""Oh My My"", ""I Love You Better"" and ""It's Got To Be Love"" are good tracks with superslick production and catchy hooks and Mickey sings the heck out of them as he does on the pretty ""Ticket On A Ferry Ride"". The problem is that they had previously released more mature songs and had progressed as musicians and this seems like a major step backwards. These songs would have been perfect for someone like the Partridge Family. Mickey & Davy finally realized that the Monkees were through and disbanded after this release. Changes doesn't add anything to the Monkee catalog and it would have been better is they went out on a higher note."
2,And then there were two....,"""Changes"" is only for the serious Monkee fans. It's sad that the band ended up as just the two doing vocals tracks to what Davy has since called a ""Jeff Berry solo album."" (The album was produced by Jeff Berry.) In fact Davy only sings on four of the origional tracks, and one, ""Peculiar,"" is not new, just a leftover from the Boyce/Hart vault. I can remember many of these tracks from the CBS Saturday morning reruns of the TV show when new songs replaced some of the old classics. But these songs are not The Monkees. The three new songs added when Rhino released Changes on CD are worth a listen, and I wonder why they were not on the album when it was first released in 1970. The era ends here with a wimper, but it could have been worse. What if Davy or Micky left and the other wanted to continue? Hey hey, I'm the Monkee!"
2,A tatty end for the monkees,"This was the Monkees final LP, (before the reunions that is). Most of the tracks have an assembly line feel which is really depressing. The exceptions are the following: Midnight Train - one of Dolenz' best, it sounds totally different to the rest of this sorry album. It predates most of the songs on Changes and would have been far more at home on the The Monkees Present, it was recorded at the sessions for that LP. The rest of the LP fails to rise above a mediocre level, not a good look! Two disillusioned artists on automatic pilot."
2,It isn't worth it,"Thought about buying this album to see if it's as bad as you hear it is? Well, it is. Trust me. Most of the album is nothing but bland '60s pop with only Davy and Micky. Both sides of the single released with this album (""Oh My My"" and ""I Love You Better"") are pretty manageable, ""99 Pounds"" is a nice change of pace (actually rocks out). But all of the rest of the songs sound the same. I'd give this album one star, but it was recorded against the Monkees' will. They were only fulfilling their contract to Colgems after Mike and Peter left. They hated this album as much as everyone else who'll listen to it."
2,A sad end,"Oh, this is bleak. The end (for a while) of the Monkees is hard to listen to, despite a few standout tracks. A little bit of Micky solo, a little bit of Davy solo, and some cold, uninspired production and performances. Even the cover art is depressing. The bonus tracks are better material than the original LP tracks. Recommended even so to Monkees completists, but not to listen to very often."
5,"Changes is one of the Monkee's Finest, whats with u people?","Granted this album was made without Mike Nesmith and Peter Tork, but it features some great tracks.Any real monkee fan could appreciate a few of the songs, aside from ""I Never Thought it Peculiar."" And for all you people who think this album stinks, I have two words for you, ""Pool It"" This album is great I don't care what anyone says."
1,Dismal Demise,This album sucked when it was first released. It sucked when expanded and remastered in 1994 and will continue to suck until eternity. If we are ever attacked by space invaders playing any track of this disaster will surely repel them.The Monkees without Nesmith were just dreadful. Here is the proof.
3,The Monkees Final Original Album from 1970.,"After a creative, yet unsuccessful year with 1969 that produced two interesting albums (""Instant Replay"" and ""The Monkees Present""), this one is no more than a wash. The Monkees were a trio throughout '69 (Peter Tork had left the band) and now they were Mike-less as well. Why did Micky and Davy make this record? Basically, to fulfill a contract, and it sounds it. Not that everything about this album is bad ( in fact, Micky's vocals are fine throughout), it's just the material is so weak, not even The Beatles could have elevated it. This is only for the die-hard Monkees fan. Definitely NOT for the casual listener. The Monkees are already an underrated group as it is!"
2,Monkee Finale,"Mike Nesmith's 1970 exit didn't stop Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones from fulfilling their Monkees contract. The result was ""Changes,"" a mediocre pop-rock effort with few bright spots. However, it's not the ""cardboard tombstone"" some critics have claimed. ""Oh My My"" (the album's only single) is a terrific rocker sung with gusto by Dolenz, who also rises to the occasion on ""Midnight Train"" and ""I Love You Better."" Jones' ballads remain as schmaltzy as ever, but he delivers a lively ""99 Pounds."" Though a half-hearted finale, ""Changes"" is easier to take than Micky, Davy and Peter's disastrous ""Pool It!"" reunion in 1987."
4,My Finale to my Collection,"I know this isn't the best, but I liked it. Especailly Micky's vocals on this album. I also loved the bonus tracks of Davy and Micky singing ""Do it in the Name of Love,"" and ""Lady Jane."""
2,Sounds just about the way you'd expect it to...,"A sad, dreary little album...the end of an era. There are three standout tracks, however: the opener(and the only single from ""Changes""), 'Oh My My', which is a brilliant, shuffling downbeat rocker with some nice lead guitar and a heartfelt, soulful vocal by Micky; Davy's '99 Pounds', a punky barnstormer of a song; and 'Midnight Train', a rollicking country-bluegrass number with another Micky vocal. Apart from these tracks the album is a pretty grim affair, but still interesting for hardcore Monkees fans."
1,Terrible,"This is one God-awful CD. And that is exactly why I bought this when it was first re-issued. I had to have this just to see if it was as bad as everyone said it was. And believe me, it IS bad. Interesting to have in the collection tho, and as usual, the liner notes are good. It was obvious this CD was for a contract fullfillment."
3,Two Little Monkees,"The Last Monkees album of the Sixties & reduced to a two-sum, with Tork & Nesmith both jumped ship.If you like their first two records ""The Monkees"" & ""More of the Monkees"", I think you will enjoy this record.The Monkees drafted in Producer/Songwriter Jeff Barry to create this record, giving a much popper feel, not unlike their early recordings.You also get the great Dolenz composition ""Midnight Train"" (a demo of this song appears as a extra track on the deluxe version of ""Headquarters"")It's not as strong previous Monkee records like ""Monkees Present"" or ""Birds the Bees & the Monkees"" but it a solid, nice listen & a fitting bookend to the sixties part of their career."
2,Bad mastering screw up,"Eagerly anticipated this disc coming in the mail. Got it, played it, can't believe my ears. The track Acapulco Sun has a loud squeal in it from 2:15 to 2:25. This is a definite tape squeal. At first it sounded like the tape needed baking, but the speed doesn't change, so I'm more inclined to think it's a tape that has lost it's lubricant. Too bad the last of the original Monkees albums gets such shoddy treatment on CD that even the mastering engineer didn't stop this release from going out with this horrible sounding mistake in it!Changes (Remastered + Bonus Tracks)"
2,Wish it were not so large and were of higher quality.,"The inset picture is nice. However, the clock's plastic hands, frame and lens are of inferior quality.It also arrived with several shallow scratches on the plastic lens. The large size and cheap qualityrender this model unsuitable for in-house decor. Mine will end up on the back porch or near the horse stable.If the manufacturer traded size for quality - producing a smaller, more attractive clock, it would bea nice gift for the money."
2,Definately not for the religious reader...,"I just finished reading 3 of St. James' books. The first two I thought were great. This one let me down because nowhere in any of her 100 suggestions was anything metioned about GOD. I cannot imagine a person who is trying to grow in her spirituality not looking to God. At one point she even mentions ""rethinking your beliefs"" - I took it to mean that if you DO worship God/Jesus to re-think that and start looking to the ""universe"" for your guidance. That, along with her suggestions to see a psychic, just left me uncomfortable. I am on a personal journey to simplify and cut out the things that don't matter and the same time grow in my understanding and relationship with Jesus. It did not occur to me that this would be completely left out.I am not totalling dissing the book, though. There are suggestions that I did find interesting/helpful. You just need to be willing to skip over certain things."
3,A good book but I echo the 1-8-99 review from OH.,"Many great tips in this book. You and I may have thought and did many of the author's ideas in this book. Still it's great to have them all in one source. Why didn't I give it 5 stars? Because I am a born-again Christian and this book did not address my spiritual need in any way. Yep, I know that's what the Bible is for. Then, why didn't I give this book 4 stars? But wait, here comes the author's advice about consulting a psychic and new age tips such as #30, 33, 85 (awful), 87.Don't get me wrong! Nearly all of the other (96 ways to ""nourish my soul"" are excellent. My refusal to give 5 stars is not simply due to differences in ""spirituality."" It's just that I think the above 4 ""ideas"" were bad ideas -- long BEFORE I was saved.Otherwise, great job, Elaine! I still recommend the book. Just be ready to skip some of the author's ideas."
5,Amazing!,"I love pure pop AND experimental music,so this hits the spot!Jack Nicholson assembled some great sound collages,and the MONKEES deliver great pop songs.A great soundtrack to a classic movie!Buy this,plus the video from Rhino!GGGGGREAT!"
4,Very good yet confusing,"Great cd and i really like every single song on this soundtrack! the sound bits are a little bizarre and not for the monkee fan who likes the 1st album songs only! there are not very many songs on this cd but there are a few great sound bits!My favorite song on this cd is ""As we go along"" beutifly sung and wonderfull music! there was one clunker ""Circle Sky"" in witch really gves me a headache! Any serious monkee fan needs this cd in there collection!"
3,Wacky,"Wish someone would explain the film ""Head"" to me. Too much fame for a strange band went to their heads. Soundtrack is interesting, and the songs are pretty good.Skip the VH-1 movie.""Brooklyn Park"" reviewer needs to learn how to spell."
1,"Boring, this one is not worth the time.","Same old sceanrio in a Tarzan story, spend your valuable time reading the earlier books in the series, you'll be happy you did!"
1,Worst Tarzan book I've ever read!,"A note to real Tarzan fans: DO NOT bother reading the last Tarzan book, the missing manuscript finalized by Joe Lansdale. The book is really awful, it has totally lost the Burroughs original touch and feel. I was SOOO disappointed after reading the book that I was really furious. It was hard to recognize this Tarzan as the same person Burroughs was writing about. You have been warned!"
1,Bad bad book!!!,"Very bad book, very unclear, and specially it's very unprecise. Errors are very common in this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody, not even my worst enemy!"
4,Revised Edition .... Much Better,"I too was leery of using this textbook in a Unix workshop that I sometimes teach for a graduate program at IUPUI. After reading the negative comments I contacted Course Technology and tracked down the editor for this title. She admitted that there were some serious typos which made the exercises difficult to complete successfully. She told me that they had hired a Linux expert to re-edit the book and it would hopefully be available in time for my class the summer of 2001. It was ready in time and it worked very well for my class. BE AWARE that the ISBN number wasn't changed and the only indication that you have the revised version is the word UPDATED in a gold star in the upper right side of the text cover. Instructors can get a CD with solution files, Powerpoint slides, Test Manager, and an Electronic Instructors Manual. I would agree that perhaps less GUI content and more of the omitted topics noted in other reviews would make this a 5-star textbook."
2,Still typos and bad screen prints in 2nd edition!,"The screen prints in this book are so poorly reproduced as to be completely unreadable and there are many, many typos. I am taking a class using this book as a text, and I spend more time trying to figure out what the typos are in the commands than I do learning how to use the software. I sent an email to the publisher regarding the fact that the screen prints, which are white characters of low resolution on a dark background, are nearly invisible; I received a reply that said they were sorry I was having trouble reading the graphics - nothing else - no apology - no statement that this is a recognized problem they would correct in a subsequent edition.My advice - find a book you can read that you won't have to waste your time proofreading and leave this one on the shelf!"
5,A hit right out of the ball park,"This novel hits the mark in several respects. It's a convincing coming-of-age book, a Montana Bildungsroman; it's also a wonderful evocation of a landscape and the human connection to it, and of an era. It's also a solid family saga.The pacing is unhurried and the writing restrained---these are virtues in a book of this sort. Rowland succeeds in holding your attention from the beginning, however, not so much through a plot hook as through the creation of a sympathetic and interesting protagonist.Anyone who's interested in well-crafted character-driven fiction should enjoy this book. It's a great beginning to what I hope will be a productive and successful career."
5,Terrific sound quality!,"""To Sir With Love"" is so clean, it's sounds as if you're in the studio. Comes as no surprise to this reviewer, always having good luck with Rhino releases. Collectors will also like the fact this CD includes Lulu's last hit from the early 80's: ""I Could Never Miss You"", a hard to find single until Rhino included it in the compliation."
4,Any truth to this?,"Wikipedia claims John Bonham of Led Zeppelin plays on Lulu's ""Everybody's Got To Clap"". Anyone have any verification?"
2,"An interesting book, if he had not made so much of it up.","This book could have been a great insight intothe current administration. UnfortunatelyMr. Reich invented several passages out of thin air. It was recently reported on NPR that several journalists had reviewed the transcripts of press conferences that are quoted in this book. When reviewed they could not locate any of the witty and insightful comments Mr. Reich claims to have made. When asked about these mistakes he claimed that ""all truth is subjective"" and that these were his memories, not a reporter's accounting. It sounds like the fact that he was a FOB has allowed Bill Clinton's view of honesty to rub off on Mr. Reich."
5,This is one terrific read.,"Mr. Reich's book, Locked in the Cabinet, is really a wonderful way of looking ""inside"" government. He is painfully honest and painfully funny too. His assessment of the other cabinet members is interesting to read and hash over in your mind. His comments on missing his family, as he is in Washington and they are in Cambridge, are touching. Finally, his study of public policy in the areas of work is extremely educational. Mr. Reich: won't you please come back to Washington? America needs you!"
4,Reich's book shows how little power the federal Cabinet has,"Robert Reich's book shows how little power the federal Cabinethas in Washington - unless, of course, the President backs the aCabinet Secretary. One can see why so little gets done by the federal government. Reich was often ""out of the loop"" - only able to get his memos to Bill Clinton by passing them to his wife Hillary (on plain stationery). And yet this is supposed to be a powerful American official. It really is sad... and shows how hamstrung Americans are by their 18th Century form of government. A very enlightening, if disheartening, read."
1,"Like president, like labor secretary",An interesting book if you had the opportunity to identify the fabrications in advance (from other book reviews). Should have had seperate chapters noted as 'fiction' or 'my interpretation.'
1,Robert Reich is a Proven Liar,"Amusing? Perhaps. But is it fact or fiction? I suggest that all of you read Jonathan Rauch's article on this book in the web magazine Slate. He proves that Reich invented episodes and situations out of whole cloth, attributing phony quotes to real people. Reich comes across as a frustrated Harvard socialist with an enormous persecution complex. Don't take my word for it, read Rauch's article!"
2,Ridiculously small watch,Watch was very small and barely fit my 6 year-old daughter's wrist. And she has a small frame! Strange.
5,The man is a genius!,"How Shrigley manages to be ascerbic and gentle at the same time, we'll never know. A great collection of drawings from the wise and witty fellow from north of Hadrian's wall."
3,Good technical overview of .NET,"Not having read much online information about .NET I was pretty happy with this book. There's a chapter on each of the major .NET features including the Common Language Runtime, C#, VB.NET, ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Winforms etc. It definitely removed a lot of the mystery of .NET for me. Previously all of the info I had read on .NET was vague generalities but this book really gets down to the actual details.I would only recommend this book to people who are experienced with C++, VB and COM. The book was more technical than I expected and there is a good deal of code. One problem was the editing, there were several mistakes and the book had a bit of a rushed feel to it. Having 10 co-authors makes the style a little uneven and there are a few items that are mentioned by more than one author.This is a decent technical overview of .NET. If that's what you're looking for I don't think you'll be disappointed."
1,"Ok, for being first. Now its superseded","This book has at least 10 authors and is fun to read for the first few chapters. Then I really got annoyed to read the same things over and over again and at the same time I missed some more in depth explanations. A lot is done with the framework itself. This is probably due to the very early delivery date of the book. Though I really enjoyed the C# example (game of life) I think you be better served with Hollis, Lhotka ""VB.Net Programming"". Also there seem to be quite a few other books out by now."
1,"Bad book, not up to Wrox standards","This book is bad, it is annoying that a company that has published so many excellent books in the past would stoop so low. This book is essentially a compendium of information that is presented in a much better fashion in the free MSDN magazine or in more depth in Worx's (good) books such as their C# and ASP+ book (which I recommend). I suppose if Fawcette published it as a special issue of VBPJ I wouldn't have been so annoyed but as a book this simply doesn't work and is a waste of your money."
4,Great Overview for .Net,"I have purchased several Dot Net books as of late. I thought the book was very thorough as an overview. This book was not intended to be a programmers guide to any single language in the Dot Net suite. But if you want a book to give you some insight as to what Dot Net is all about, this is a great place to start. I also purchased Wrox ""Programming C# with the public Beta"", although this book is being replaced with Professional C#, I still learned much from this title as well."
2,Visual Basic plague,"Although the book claims that several languages support .NET (VB, C#, etc), all examples are in Visual Basic, which I find annoying."
2,Dull,"This story was about a girl named Becky who was an editor of an apparent small magazine. But they had a new publisher. Rick wanted to change the vision, change the layout, and had dollar signs in his eyes. He and Becky clashed on what the magazine should be like...Personally, I found Rick to be a jerk. I didn't care for his attitude. He seemed to be an antaganist throughout the story. I did NOT like his attitude toward writing the tabloid type article on the Senator. I don't understand why Becky fell in love with him...This story was dull. I found myself rushing througgh parts of it, and putting my book down several times. I forced myself to finish it but still didn't like it. Don't bother with this one, unless you need a good sleep!"
4,Tall rocket that flew very high,My 6 year old loved this rocket. It flew very high and was simple to complete with him. It flew so high that it drifted a little too far and we lost it. We order this one and the stormcaster (review soon).
5,Final Warning May be too late!,"I didn't actually buy this for myself, I got it as a gift for my brother-in-law before the election. He tells me he really liked it so I am going on his say so! Same for Shadow Government!"
2,Another governent conspiracy movie,It was a decent DVD to watch but dated. I will giveit two of my best starts. I did not leave an impact on me.
2,Not Really a Good Movie,This movie is a re-hash of old news. I was very disappointed in it. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone.
2,Washed out collars,"The collars were great with one HUGE exception. These collars held their dimensional characteristics but, the color came out of the collar and leached onto the white-coated dogs I had them on when it rained. If you buy these, try to wash them or something to keep the color from getting on your pet's coat. Other than that they had great hardware on them and are durable."
3,Not one of their best.,"I like it okay, but Micky's songs aren't really good. I only like ""Just A Game"" and ""Shorty Blackwell"" from him. Rosemarie was better on Missing Links. It wasn't as nutso and crazy as it was on here.Mike's songs were somewhat depressing on this album. The only one of Mike's I liked was ""I Won't be the Same Without Her.""However on a lighter note, I loved Davy's songs on even ""Don't Listen to Linda."""
3,a must for die-hard Nesmith fans w/a Davy Jones gem.,"Mike Nesmith's style settled on this album. The bonus track ""St. Matthew"" is the only great song ever written about the holy ghost. I can't think of a deeper theme. I traced Nesmith's geneology from ""Different Drum"" and ""Door into Summer"" thru ""Listen to the band."" His work is a real breath of life, the enduring quality being sophistication w/soul. ""You and I"" on this album (Davy) surprised me-hard rock!"
3,So-So...,"Not their best work, not even close, in fact. But this one does have a few bright spots: Dolenz's ""Just a Game"" and ""Shorty Blackwell"" and Nesmith's ""While I Cry"" are standout cuts. A lackluster album oveall, but if you really LOVE the Monkees, you will find at least a few good tunes on this one."
2,This is a bad record.,"I'm a huge fan of the Monkees and have been since their 1986 reunion. However, this record is simply not very good. Largely put together with a bunch of leftover tunes from earlier sessions, this one comes across like a bad mix.Unfortunately, the songwriting aces used so effectively on the group's outstanding albums--the first four--seemed to have thrown them some pretty bad songs. Mike Nesmith's tunes are the only thing truly worth having on here."
3,A few good ones.,"'Through The Looking Glass' is a very nice song with a classic sound. It probably could have been a #1 record just a year or so earlier -- when the band was still phenomenally popular. 'I Won't Be The Same Without Her' is a nice one from Nesmith with somewhat of a surprise British-Invasion sound to it. 'Tear Drop City' is obviously a clone of 'Last Train To Clarksville' - but so what?, it has a great sound. 'Just a Game' is an interesting effort from Mickey - it sounds like it could have been something, perhaps had it been produced during the Chip Douglas era. 'Me Without You' and 'You and I' are decent Davy songs. The rest of the album is nothing special. ('Shorty Blackwell', like 'Just A Game' - shows Mickey was willing to take chances - unfortunately, it misses the mark). Worth owning if you're collecting the entire set of original albums."
2,Marketing For The Home-Based Business,"I was expecting to get some really great marketing ideas since it was a very recent book. I was able to get one idea out of this book, instead of all the ones I had expected. He simply states to check into advertising in the yellow pages prior to the next issue being published."
2,Costly but good,"I can't disagree with the reviewers comments on the quality or taste of the product, but I seem to remember buying this for about 1/2 the price when the grocery store used to carry it. I'll be looking for a cheaper supplier"
5,Thai Coconut Ginger Soup,"""WOW""...My first time to try Thai Coconut Ginger Soup, I'm Hooked! This is really good, and so easy. I made it with chicken, added some precooked rice, a few mushroom slices, a can of chicken broth, and a can of coconut milk...The flavor is so good and rich. There are 12 packets with 2 packets of soup base mix in each one, for a total of 24."
5,Must have for the John Wayne Fan!,I bought this for my Dad who is a huge John Wayne Fan. And he loved it. It is 2 of John Wayne's great movies in one.
3,John Wayne Movies,Good but not best of John Wayne's many movies. I hardly purchase DVD's or books except from Amazon.com. The $80 yearly 2 day free delivery and at least in my state no sales taxes make for economical purchases for this senior citizen.
1,This book is why people hate math.,"If you're hoping to do well in your mathematics course or just learn math on your own time, you've chosen the wrong book.The sections provide very little lead-in, and are filled with a few examples, which may or may not help you do the homework problems at the end of the section. Many times you will find formula notation different from the standard that all other textbooks use, so if you move onto the next level of math, you will see entirely new (Easier) ways of learning the material.This book only works sufficiently if you've been through precalculus/calculus sequence already and are looking for just a quick cheap refresher on some algebra, which is probably why it is appealing to college professors. If purchasing a different book is an option for you, go for Blitzer or Larson's Precalculus text."
1,This book is the pits,"I am by no means a math wizard. I am, however, able to learn things on my own fairly well. This book makes that nearly impossible though. This book gives very few examples, and the few that they do give rarely give any clues to what needs to be done to solve the equations. It also fails to really teach anything. It's by no means for a student that is going to be going through an online course where they won't be interfacing with an instructor. I would not have enrolled into the course for online schooling if I had know this books was going to be this terrible. I strongly don't recommend this book!!!"
4,Great Book for NON-Algebra folks,"Perfect book for what it was designed to do - get you though Algebra. Not a lover of Algebra, I found this book to be helpful with a lot of additional information to make understanding of the concepts less painful! I keep it around as a reference book now for those times that you actually do need Algebra in the real world!"
3,Be Careful!!,"Be Careful if you are in the U.S., Regon 2 DVD Not playable on Regon 1 DVD players!! I found this out the hard way!!! If your in the U.S. your better off Just getting the U.S. version.The cd is Ok, Not one of In Flames better outings, They TOTALY destroyed Moonshield - 1 of my favorite songs, no Acustic Guitar What so ever.Im Giving it a 3 Stars Just bacause it's IN Flames my favorite Band."
5,"Thank you, Mr. Galway","James Galway is an amazing musician, and this is a wonderful book. He has insitlled in me a deeper appreciation for the instrument itself. From history to techinque, every page encourages the reader to strive for nothing less than absolute beauty in creating music. While many professional musicians have a way of intimidating, Mr. Galway's approach is to build up one's ability and confidence. Although at this time I am an intermediate player at best, Mr. Galway's wit, humor, knowledge, and love of the flute will help me grow as a musician."
1,ack!,"Never, ever, ever buy a 13th Floor Elevators compilation that leaves off ""Dust""! Just buy ""Easter Everywhere"". It's better than the other albums that the songs on this CD come from anyway."
3,Not insulated _Prepare to burn your hands!!,I got this for the large capacity and the esthetics of stainless.I have used it several times and find that the outer cannister gets extremly hot when filled with a hot liquid. This indicates a lack of insulation and lots of heat loss. After 4 hours your coffee is luke warm to tepid. Not nearly as efficient as the original glass vacume thermoses.Looks good but does not insulate as well as glass thermos does. I would not recommend this item.
5,I love these,"I am on a low to 0 carb diet (Paleo) but I still want a treat now and then. I love these as much as I used to love a Mounds bar. My 11 year old daughter loves them too and I use them for a light snack for her after school. There is, to me, a slight flavor that is the tiniest bit like a vitamin-like flavor that you would not find in a Mounds bar. I am either used to it or it is so subtle that I don't mind it. So despite that bit of odd flavor, I really like them."
1,This cannot be Paleo.,"Another market hype on an existing product twisting to try to be something it isn't. If you cannot pronounce it, it isn't what you think it is. Almonds, coconut...those I get. The rest of it is nutritional and dietetic mumbo-jumbo. Avoid. Ultimately this is not what you want it to be."
5,"Fantastic, Insightful Read!","As an avid reader of non-fiction books based on historical events, I picked up 47 Down in hopes of learning a bit about my home state and in return I got so much more. Not only does O. Henry Mace give a gripping account of a disaster that affected the lives of many but a concise representation of the background and history of mines in California and across the country. What I appreciated most about the book is the detail the author took into researching the lives of not only the 47 miners and their families, but also the reporters, rescue workers, and the town as a whole. By the time I closed the book I had a clear picture in my mind of what life was like in Jackson, California 1922. I can hardly wait for the next book O. Henry Mace writes!"
3,A dissapointment,"This book was OK, the kind of thing you might want to read once and be glad you borrowed from the library.The author tries to tell two stories, one of the disaster, the other of the news lady who rose to stardomby covering the events. I am sure that as a journalist, the author was fascinated by the later, but to anyoneelse it seems inappropriate at best. The book ""the deep dark"" about the Sunshine Mine fire in Idaho is farbetter and highly recommended to anyone who wants to read about this sort of thing."
1,Great price!!!!!,"Placed order...seller never shipped items....after approx 1 month seller states they are refunding due to loss in mail...seller not able to provide tracking number...When asked if I should re-order...no response...Not a pleasant experience...Consider before ordering....Regards,K"
3,Not the worst thing you've ever seen,"...and not even that close. It truly was ahead of its time in terms of teen sex comedies, and despite the clunky direction, there are some fairly decent jokes to be found. Guttenberg was sorta sweet, Branscombe Richmond was neat in his pre-Renegade youth, Ed Lauter was nasty, and Phil Silvers, though not by any means at the height of his powers, has some funny stuff. Apparently (if you can believe this) at least partly based on facts at Beverly Hills High School in the late 60's -- I guess that makes it a semi-documentary? Would definitely have benefited from some nudity -- some guides say there is 'partial' nudity. Trust us -- we've seen it a lot -- there ain't nothin'."
4,Good book,"In kristy in charge, kristy gets to be in charge of her P.E. class. But things don't go well....because a boys she hates is teaching it with her. P.E. is war. To find out what's next read Kristy in charge."
3,Not that great...,"Kristy in Charge wasn't as great as I thought it would be. Just like the last reviewer, the summary sounded really cool, and I thought it would be a great book. Was I ever wrong! This book was dull, and not totally realistic. But the side plot was pretty good. Vanessa's poetry school really cracked me up!"
5,A great back to basics toy!!,"I ordered two sets of these bricks for my 2 year old and 6 year old. They both will spend long periods of time playing with them. Although they don't play the same way, it is great to see them each playing with a toy that doesn't do the playing for them. No lights, sounds, or special effects!! I am VERY pleased with this purchase and would buy them again for a gift in a heartbeat. The assembly wasn't as complicated as I was expecting either. I had both sets folded and put together in under half an hour, and I wasn't trying to hurry either."
5,Perfect building blocks,"I was thrilled with the building blocks I ordered to have on hand for my grandchildren to play with. They are very sturdy and very , very easy to fold into the bricks. There extra large size will make sturdy high-rises, or whatever else their furtile imaginations inspire them to build."
5,Great building blocks,"I have three boys aged 14 to 9. For the last 9 years the boys have been playing with these and still do. When I was trying to cull out the old toys, i was informed by all three that they needed to stay and might I please get more?with this in mind, I will be purchasing a few more sets so that as the boys grow so can their buildings."
5,DSD Makes them sound better!,"This SACD of the Bizet and Grieg Suites started out life as aTelarc L.P. DG 10048 then is was released on CD, now it has beenremasterd and issued as a Hybrid SACD that plays in stereo.These perfomances were recorded using the Soundstream Systemwhich were done at 50kHz. CD's were done at 44.1 which meantthat some of the great sound of the recordings were lost whenbeing transfered to CD. Fortunatly the SACD uses somethingcalled Direct Stream Digital or DSD. This allows the origianl50kHz sound to be heard on a disc as it was meant to be heard.As for the performances Leonard Slatkin and the St. LouisSymphony deliver some sonic knockouts! At just over 79:00minutes you get alot for your money. Great sound! Room fillingspeaker demonstraiting, lease busting performances! The Rimsky-Korsakov "" Russian Easter Overture"" is worth the price of thedisc alone!"
4,Jig-a-licious [no spoilers],"""Goblin Quest"" begins the exploits of Jig the goblin, a clever yet cowardly runt pulled into a quest to find the Rod of Creation. The undemanding writing appeals to all ages without any graphic details of battles or harsh language. The novel is a generally pleasant read filled with funny incidents and witty remarks yet somewhat resembles a gaming session from a goblin's perspective.Jig and Smudge, his pet fire spider, are forced to follow Prince Barius's group deeper than any goblin has traveled into the depths of the caverns. Ryslind, the crazy wizard brother to Barius, has a brilliant method on maintaining his spellbook and Darnak, a dwarven cleric, preserves the peace between the two. Also along on the adventure is elf thief Riana, not terribly experienced but sneaky as amusingly shown in Chapter 13.A detailed map of the significant terrains would have been useful.I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.Thank you."
5,"Step aside, Frodo!","A prince, a wizard, a dwarf cleric and an elven thief go into a cave...this sounds like a bizarre version of the man-goes-into-a-bar joke, and it is because the whole story is told from the point of view of the goblin they catch to guide them through the tunnels. (LOL)Jig is a runty, near-sighted goblin who got grabbed up to go on patrol only because the patrol leader had a grudge against him. He falls into the hands of the adventurers and practically has a heart attack when he learns they are looking for the Rod of Creation. (ROTFLMAO)This is more than a clever parody of Tolkien's THE HOBBIT. The book resembles a game of Dungeons and Dragons with Himes as Dungeon Master. It's a lot of fun and you don't even have to roll any dice!"
3,Pikachu Get Well? A bit thin.,We have a Pokemon fan at our house but this story doesn't have enough substance to hold his attention for more than one reading.
3,Number Munchers,"The program is good at what it does. It provides a fairly interesting environment for young people to have drill & practice in fundamental arithmetic. The program has some age on it, and its graphics are dated, but the math is presented in a sound way. As the participant continues, the speed of the program increases, which has the benefit of stretching the concentration of the player. It runs on Windows or Mac platform, and is recommendable for students working below high school level."
5,Double battery charge interval,"This excellent battery with double the charge capacity means longer use time between charges. By having extra batteries (I bought three) I can carry two spares with me during travel and avoid using the charger. The price was right, the delivery cost minimal and the service prompt and pleasant. I will definitely buy from this seller again."
3,sold bad batteries,"BUYER BEWARE! I bought 2 of these chargers 6 mons ago from a seller that i'm not sure i have access to anymore or am able to review bcz i would put them on blast so hard.Overall and sad to say, buying on Amazon is really a gamble! One time a book i ordered for school that never shipped and i never got word from the seller--ever-- even after numerous email attempts.now, i get 2 bogus cell phone batteries. The first one at least lasted a 5mons so i didnt realize it was whack! But, the 2nd one i bought lasted only 2-1/2 weeks. at first, i thot the phone was just dying but i looked at other battery-purchase reviews and its pretty consistent that these batteries are past their shelf-life or something.i'm bummed bcz i really need to have a phone and buying a new one is not affordable at this time but taking a chance on a battery is the best option i have.shame on these companies!"
1,Waste of Money,Don't bother wasting your money on this article. It is less than a page and doesn't offer any insight!
2,Make sure you get what you ordered.,"Please make sure you check with the seller to make sure you are going to receive the same product that is in the description. Check features and model number. Maybe even have them send you a picture of the product. When ordering this product, I received a model that was years older than the one described on the site."
5,Very Well Done,"If you want a real understanding of US/USSR military cooperation (or lack of) during World War II, read this book. I read this book and the classic John Deane book ""The Strange Alliance"" and feel I really came away with a much better understanding of relations between the Americans and Soviets during World War II, and also, gained a much better understanding of the coming Cold War between the two countries. Several other books have been written on Operation FRANTIC, but they pale in comparison to this work. Very scholarly research. Only wish in book was a closer examination of the propaganda generated in the United States by the shuttle bombing missions and any effects they may have had on FRANTIC."
5,Can't be better,The performance and recording is fantastic.This cd is better than live performance I just went.Money well spent. Just get it.
4,"IF YOU LOVED MILES DAVIS' ""BITCHES BREW"" YOU'LL TRULY ENJOY THIS JAZZ-FUSION PROJECT THAT FEATURES SOME OF THE YOUNG GUNS...","...FROM THE SCHOOL OF MILES!!! What was a Rare and Hard To Find Double Vinyl Album is now on 1 (One) Compact Disc! Clocking in at almost 79:00 (Seventy-Nine Minutes). TAKE NOTE!...This album is not 100% (One Hundred Percent) musically like Miles Davis' ""Bitches Brew"" which would be deemed as Jazz-Rock-Fusion this is Jazz-Fusion, and is a little smoother. Joining Woody Shaw on this project (His first as a leader) was: Bennie Maupin, Lenny White, and Ron Carter who ALL played with Miles Davis...The first 2 (Two) actually played on the ""Bitches Brew"" album. To round out the musicians you have: Gary Bartz, George Cables, and Clint Houston. Everybody soars to new heights on an album that will give you Jazz-Fusion album collection that extra added plus!"
2,I Like the Idea Better Than the Execution,"I wanted to like this album when I bought the vinyl twofer. I wanted to like this album when it was reissued--in slightly truncated form--on CD. But I still don't like it that much. It's that I like the idea of the album more than the execution. Lots of wonderful and gifted musicians--Gary Bartz, George Cables, et al--but it still doesn't succeed for me. I think Woody Shaw was one of the great trumpeters; I just appreciate his other albums more than this one."
4,Nice read,"It was fun and nice to read. Nothing super special, but I did enjoy reading it, which is what I'm looking for... I even want to read about the other brothers, so... good!"
3,Good,I enjoyed this book. I enjoy reading books from this time period. I will read the other books from this series.
4,I like the book,The characters were wonderful in the story and I will be reading the other books to follow. I thought that the story was great but I didn't care for the fighting portion it was to long. Over all this was a good read
3,It was okay....,"The book isn't bad by any means and the author has talent. I just felt short changed somehow. I am interested in reading the next one since the ""dead"" brother is gonna turn up alive, that will surely be an intriguing storyline. The hero in this book was a little unbelievable, but I would recommend this series to others."
4,the wild one,I READ THE WILD ONE AND HAVE ORDERED THE OTHER 3 OF THE SERIES. THE AUTHOR HAS MADE THE BOOK INTERESTING AND EXCITING!! IF YOU LIKE ROMANCE AND TWISTS TO A STORY I Can RECOMMEND THIS SERIES.
3,Decent.,"I didn't particularly enjoy this book, but I clearly didn't dislike it enough to abandon it. It was a decent story that didn't focus enough on emotion; it never went quite as far as it had the potential to go. The defiant hero was too accepting of the lack of his wife's love. The fiery wife was too accepting of their situation, and the six month old baby seemed to always be asleep. Eh."
3,Ok,"I bought this whole series, based on reviews of others. I never do that. I'm hoping the following books will be better than this one. It was ok but not anything special. Juliet,who was supposedly very mature and sensible, some how falls for her dead fiance's immature brother. This happens very quickly, which doesn't speak well of her supposed love for his deceased brother Charles. She also has a child fathered by the deceased brother. Weird that she or the wild one would even consider sleeping together. I had trouble with that whole concept."
2,"Enjoyed it, for the most part","My biggest peeve with historical romances is that the author is using modern thinking during historical times. This is evident in several parts of this book which bothered me. The hero seems immature then I remember that he's only 23, so I could get over that. Overall, I liked it. Nothing memorable though."
4,Started me on the whole series!,Loved this book. Found it poignant and funny at the same time. Loved Gareth. He is funny and carefree. This is the first in the series and each book has something of a cliff hanger that compels you to read the next book. Love this series.
4,"Good Story, not so good characters","This is a good story about characters I didn't like very much. Lord Gareth was very immature and Juliet was a single mother in a time when this would mark her as a wanton not marriage material for an aristocratic Lord. Yes, it is all rationalized but I still had trouble with the concept. But, as I said, the story is good. I really want to read the rest of the de Montforte Brothers series. I'm especially interested in Lucian's story. There is a surprise at the end of this edition that is an intriquing intro to the next book in the series, THE BELOVED ONE. Hopefully the remaining brothers will not disappoint me."
2,Disappointed,"Downloaded this book due to high rating but sorely disappointed. The chemistry was not there between the characters. The situation that they were in are not believable such as spending wedding night at a brothel with a child. Had to skip bunch just to get to ending just to see what happen at the end. And needless to say, the ending is ridiculous. Spoiler: what in their world with the dead brother coming home. Seriously?"
3,Very boring story with little historically accurate information....,"This is one of those books that just happens to take place in regency England, but which actually could take place today. The book was very mediocre both in plot and character development. The female lead character isn't that likable and the characters change their fundamental beliefs so often that they are very empty. A very disappointing book!"
3,um....it was ok,"In all honesty, I read this book a year or two ago and...well...it wasn't one of Harmon's best books. I agree that the hero was quite immature and really quite annoying. I thought that it was nice in the end when he turned out to be a man of courage but I usually like my heros somewhat...more intelligent and mature and well...a man. Gareth was like a boy in a man's body and it wasn't until near the end of the book that he figured out he needed to mature a bit to make his new life with his wife her infant child (his brother's, no less) work. I wouldn't NOT recomend the book because it wasn't bad but it's just not a book that I would start a friend out on to advertise this author. Danelle Harmon is usually an excellent author and I hope her newest book, ""The Wicked One"" will not dissapoint me."
4,A free ebook that doesnt suck!!,"Yes I know there are a number of free ebooks out there that dont suck and fortunately this was one of them. Perhaps a 4 was generous but probably about right for this well written tale which is also a full length book not like most truncated e book offerings. Historical romance is not my genre but I fancied something a bit different and found myself enjoying it. At first the female protagonist was a bit annoying in places but it all came together into a diverting and romantic tale. I also loved the hook at the end of the story!Whilst I wont rush out and buy the next in the series, when I am next in the mood for this kind of tale, I will be happy to pay for the next instalment! If this is your genre (and over the years I have read a few historicals) it is fairly safe to say that you will find this fairly engaging, romantic and a good example of a hot (but not too X rated) historical romance."
3,Loved it!!!,"A beautifully written story. I loved the characters,the plot and I am definitely looking forward to reading all the stories about the brothers. I strongly recommend this book to lovers of romance and intrigue :)"
4,Good,Well written and engaging romance that was a quick and delightful read. I look forward to the next book. The character I found the most compelling was that of Lucien and I hope we will see an entire book dedicated to his story in the future.EDIT - I see there IS a book dedicated to Lucien - can't wait to read it!
1,the wild one,I found the book to be predictable and droll. The attempt at humor fell flat and the writing was simply ordinary.
2,don't know why i bought this,if you like historical romance novels (which i don't) you will probably like this book. i ended up not reading the book after all because i'm into historical mystery and not really into romance.
1,The Wild One,Great read. Couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read about the other DeMontforte brothers. Transported back in time in a good way.
2,disappointing,"Although the plot could offer interesting implications, the author failed to fulfill it with believable characters. Juliet emerges like an easily infatuated creature that looks at an English officer and falls in love with him because he's beautiful in his uniform. Afterwards, she confesses her new husband that she fell in love with him at the first sight of him defending a group of people from highwaymen. On the other hand, the male protagonist, Gareth, struggles to face the responsibility of a new family and decides to redeem his reputation and earn the money to support his family by...fighting on a ring. And even more incredibly, his wise wife and the stern Duke proudly support him in this decision. Like this could be a serious way to sustain a family, given the historical context and noble origin of Gareth."
4,"Truly the best of the series, contains a bit of spolier","I held my reviews of this series until I read them all, and I must say this is the best one of all. I totally loved Gareth and Juliet story. I mourned with her, and laughed out loud along with the den of debauchery. I praise Gareth for his determination and loyalty to his family and his strength to prove himself a man, and to take on the responsibility of another brother. He never lost his joyful spirit of life even after facing all the pitfalls he encountered along the way. Lucien is my second favorite brother even with his interference with his siblings lives. Even if you only read this book it's worth it, far better than the rest."
4,The wild one,Nice reading of the ways people lived and dressed in bygone days and how they travelled goRom place to place.
5,wild one,"Good reading .page turning,makes you want to read about the rest of the family.and the insert about Charles was excellent."
3,Pleasant read,"I was expecting your run of the mill rake story but this is a bit different. Normally the hero is dashing, witty and utterly in control at all times but not Gareth.Gareth is the first hero I've encountered that doesn't have his act together...which is refreshing to have that dose of reality.I would've liked to see Juliet in a more active role seeing as she's the more practical one and use to hard work. I suppose she was being supportive and giving Gareth the chance to prove himself but still...I expected her to be more resourceful."
3,Great Read!,Great read especially for free! Loved the characters and story line. Looking forward to reading about the other brothers. Thanks!
1,very dull storyline,"I was very very disappointed in this book. I was truly surprised at the good reviews. The characters are so bland and the only one thats not,doesn't even play a big part. The writing seems juvenile"
2,really?,This book had so much potential. broken hearted new mother seeks out her dead baby daddy's family and falls in love with charming younger brother. too bad that she is clearly weak willed when it comes to attractive men and kinda an idiot. too bad he is a total idiot with the maturity level of a eight grader. boxing...really??
4,Relieved,"I thought for sure this book was going to end in sorrow, but instead ending with relief and surprise. I normally Don't like the books written in the 1700's or 1800's but this was a good story.Melissa Zieger"
5,Romance,I loved the book. Very good historical romance novel. Kept me interested until the end. I would recommend this book. Look foward to the next one.
4,Love it,This is a really good book. This is the first book that I have read by this author and I hope to read more by her.
5,Heart warming romance,A wonderful story with great characters. My only complaint would be that some scenes tend to drag along. I am ready to start the next book in this series.
4,Well Written Romance,The story of the first De Montfort brother was the hook and it is set tightly. The subsequent stories in the series hopefully will be as absorbing. Had a hard time putting THE WILD ONE down.
4,Mom,It was an excellent story. I can't wait to read the next book. The series is about a family with different personalities as we know every family has a variety.
4,Enjoyed it,"Good read. I like this type fast reading book. It was funny and predictable, but I liked it. Escape type book. Good read for rainy day to make you forget everyday life."
3,Good,"This story was good, I liked that the storyline was different but it took to long to develop. I would recommend it though."
3,"I would say more like, 3.5 stars","It started off slow, but definitely ramped up towards the end, enough to make me buy the second book in the series. There were some inconsistencies in the writing that were so distracting that I could do nothing but roll my eyes and plow through to the end, which is the good part! Those fight scenes at the end were so vivid that I dreamt about them that night! Seriously, why did the author hold back that kind of writing for the end? Maybe it was to get me hooked on the series, and if that's the case, with the second book (The Beloved One) she's certainly keeping my interest...I stayed up until 3am reading the second book!So overall, a week start that gets better by the end of the book and hopefully continues on through the end of the series."
5,The Wild One ( The De Montforte brothers),I love the way it's writen the auther did a very goodjob I brought others from this auther :)
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,The character descriptions were colorful and detailed enough to where you could picture them in your mind. The story had lots of twists and turns which made me not want to put the book down. This was an awesome read and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
4,the wild one,"An interesting beginning to a series of these brothers. Adventure, humor, love, and faith fill this tale of a irresponsible, youthful gentleman and a brave, serious American woman. Ready to read the others soon!"
5,The Wild One (Gareth's Story),"I have enjoyed THE DE MONTFORTE BROTHERS books tremendously. I am reading The Wicked One now and it promises to be as good as the previous three. I love the Regency period but was getting totally bored with the normal storylines; fight, bump and bed, comprimised, marry, etc. These De Montforte Brothers each have their own storyline, but big brother Duke Lucien give each of his brothers a little push to the alter. These books get my highest ratings because they are remind me of Lindsay in her glory days and of my favorite Kathleen Woodiwiss (RIP) style of writing. Ms. Harmon has the right mixture of storylines and was not just a ""bump and bed"" book as so many historical romances are now."
5,Confidence Building and Encouraging,"I picked up this book because I am facing planning and executing a campaign over the next few years. I have worked on a big campaign before with a larger team, but I have never been in on the planning portion before. I'm only a quarter of the way through the book, but I already feel like this entire project is more possible than when I started. Her level of detail is excellent, her language is approachable, and I love the CD she included. I would highly recommend this book."
5,A real treat for fans of David Torn,"Micheal Whalen provides a great album, and as a bonus, a great music playfield for David Torn. Most enjoyable.Soothing, serene, a great spacemusic album for you fans of this genre. You know who you are! :-)I'd venture out on a limb and call this an American version of David Sylvian's instrumental works, provided that doesn't cause an international huff someplace.Highly recommended.Tom"
4,Nightscenes,I love this CD. I think it is a very interesting mix of new age flavor and old school melody and design. I find it extremely relaxing. Its great for both chilling and thinking but not if you're looking to get pumped up. I gave it only four stars because I felt some of the tracks toward the end of the CD slowed down a bit too much and dragged a bit longer than I wished they would. But this imperfection doesn't take away from the sincereity of emotion the music embodies.
4,Different,"I am usually not a fan of vampire movies. I thought it might be interesting to see how other countries portray vampires. I have to admit this one was pretty good. It was also kind of funny. I liked the rock band Circo, and Daddy Yankee, although he had only a small part, was believable. I would recommend this movie if like vampire flicks."
5,Vampiros masquerade,"I enjoyed playing the video game Vampire: The Masquerade. This movie like the game was fun. It struck a chord. The character/actors were believable, consistent, good. It's one those movies I'd like to watch again."
3,Vampiros Boricuas...,"La pelicula tiene una buena historia y trama, con actores de segunda que a veces se ven creibles y a veces simplemente te dan ganas de apagar la television y hacer algo mas productivo. La pelicula tiene la primera aparicion de el cantante Daddy Yankee en una pelicula, lo cual hizo muy bien por los 2 minutos que aparece en pantalla. A pesar de todo la pelicula tiene decentes efectos especiales y una buena historia llena de terror, suspenso y a veces ocasiones humoristicas,si puedes ignorar lo malo que son algunos de los actores a lo mejor te gusta y el precio no esta nada mal."
5,"Everything you always wanted to know about replication, but were afraid to ask","Having dealt with DB2 and Oracle databases for years I wasn't too worried when I suddenly ""inherited"" 40 SQL Servers. However I was not prepared for intricacies of bi-directional replication running over a cross country network! I wish I had this book back then to lessen the learning curve. This book is all that one needs to take on transactional and snapshot replication. Everything is in one place and organized in a logical manner.For anyone getting involved in MSSQL replication, this is the book that you need. Trust me on this."
1,Junk,I purchased 4 of these cordless impacts every single one started smoking or burned out after 1 week of use. This tool is garbage.
5,Detailed presentation.,"As a nurse and a daughter that lost her mom to Alzheimer's, this is a sobering, compassionate and honest presentation of this dreaded disease. Highly recommend to anyone facing this journey somewhere in their life and anyone that desires to understandAlzheimers at any level."
3,"Good compilation, but missing key tracks from original LP's","Overall this is a pretty good collection of late 70's early 80's Punk. Mostly UK bands, but some US are represented as well. I had the original LP's from the late eighties, and there are a few key tracks missing from each volume, most motably an ultra rare early version of Anti Pasti's ""No Government"" For first timers, you will delight at the amount of quality, catchy, early punk offered here, for old punks, you've heard it all before and most of the best tracks are missing from the original."
5,GOOD,"GOOD product, very easy to use and seems to be made of a pretty durable plastic that should hold up for quite some time to come."
5,Simple yet effective,"This capper serves us well! We easily cap several cases using this capper. I have never used any other capper, but I won't need to since this one does its job and does it well!"
2,Cheaply made,"Used it on three batches, had to fight with it. Sure it ""works"" but it doesn't seem like it will last much longer. The metal bit where it clamps on the bottle to anchor itself is starting to bend. Just spend the extra money on a better one, no point in buying junk."
3,Nothing Special. Dents the caps,"Nothing too special here. Better than the Red Baron piece of junk that didn't even make it to my house without breaking. It does the job, and it relatively easy to use. I don't feel like I'm going to break the capper or the bottle when using it, which is nice.Only thing that some people don't like (I couldn't care less) is that the magnet that holds the cap in while during capping will put a .5"" diameter (off center) dent in the top of the cap. You end up with something that kind of looks like the cap on a jam jar. Safety sealed beer, anyone?"
4,Very easy to use,"The bottle capper is very easy to use and does not require a lot of force. I purchased this item in order to make craft items out of bottle caps. I had hoped you could use the device to squeeze the bottle cap rim shut without having to put it around a bottle. You do need to put it on a bottle in order for it to close the rims, so I put it around an old coke bottle and then pulled it off with a bottle opener. If you have a design on your bottle cap, it is possible that some of the paint with become scratched when bottling your beverage."
2,This seems to b a straight copy of a book published in 1900,"This book appears to be little more than a dressed up copy (republication) of the original book of the same name published in 1900 by Globe Bible Publishing Co. in Philadelphi, PA. I happen to be lucky enough to actually own one of the originals. The original is cloth bound book with the same photo as on the paperback embossed on the front and is 511 pages and has 62 photos & drawings. I have mostly just read the intro and looked at the photos. The intro is by Richard Spillane (editor of the Galveston Tribune) who escaped the island to tell the world of the disaster and plea for help. I lived in the Clear Lake area for 26 years and I recognize a lot of the area he describes. I tried reading the book several times but it is rather fragile and has a lot of melodrama.One thing the book really shows is the different perspective of that time (especially in regard to race) and the shear carnage and damage of the storm. The photos are amazing."
2,Dissapointing,"The writing is so simplistic, the characters are so cartoonish and there are so many inaccuracies that reading this book becomes a dissapointment. It almost feel like it had been written by 15 year old!!! The real story of the Galveston hurricane is so rich and powerful that it makes one wonder how come this author couldn't come up with something better than this."
5,Barnett Newman -Thomas Hess,Fine review of of the life and works of this master. This 1971text was the first comprehensive study of this visionary artist.In addition to excellent b/w plates many color illustrations.Both thoughtful and insightful view into his life.Endorsed by Annalee (artists widow).
1,Not well written and hard to read,"The very least I would expect from the author of this, his twentieth book (the previous 19 being all fiction) is an understanding of grammar and punctuation - something which is sadly lacking in this work.As a general rule, we do not start sentences with ""And"" or ""But"" and, although occasionally acceptable, there are too many instances here. Just as a capital letter commences any new sentence, so a capital letter is the first to appear after a colon - but not in this work. Furthermore, I found too many instances of digression when try to make a simple point.All of which is off-putting for the serious reader.In short, this book is hard to review because it is most difficult to read and if it can't be read - then there really is no point in it being reviewed in the first place.Poor showing - especially after all that research.NM"
1,Wonderful Lectures on Mythology,"Too bad the casettes had tape hiss and poor quality audio.Not sure if this was in the source.But the videotapes i saw of these lectures did not have this problem.They don't have to go bananas with noise reduction but a little clean up through a digital software that are dime a dozen nowadays would have fixed the problem or at least dampened it down a bit.Like if the original sound reels were processed by Noise Reduction through a dolby workstation.Which i know Highbridge has used to remaster stuff before, just not this time.Not sure if these problems are on the CD version as well as the CD version is out of print and no longer available except at absurd prices."
4,Save this book for when you need a belly laugh!,"""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Throne"" made me choke on my diet coke and snort Oreo cookies. Georgia Richardson's droll observations made me think of Erma Bombeck and Shel Silverstein slurping down Brandy Alexanders and pondering the meaning of life while nibbling on cocktail weiners."
5,"Keep laughing, you're not alone!","I read a few chapters each night so I could guarantee that I would go to sleep laughing. Georgia Richardson (aka Queen Jaw Jaw) has been through it all and came out writing so we could laugh with her. You may recognize yourself and wonder why you weren't laughing when it happened to you. Thank you, Queenie, for your unique and Southern perspective."
5,"I laughed so hard, I cried!","A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Throne is a laugh-out-loud book that will have everyone bowing at the Queen's feet...while reaching for those Oreos! If you've been taking yourself too seriously, or suffering from a case of the ""Baby Boomer blues,"" Richardson's book is the cure. She'll lighten your spirit while tickling your funny bone. On every page, her huge heart shines through. Plus, she must have strong genes because her boxer Trixie has also become a first-rate humorist!"
4,Wonderfully Witty,"Tracey Price-Thompson writes with a certain wit that endears you to her characters immediately. From the time that you turn the first page, until you close the back cover, you become a part of Sandi's world.It's refreshing to read about the strengh and resilience of the African American family in this novel. Tracey shows us that when the chips are down the black family stands up!"
5,Keeping it real!,"Romance is never all hearts and flowers, nor is it set in the cookie-cutter mold of girl meets boy, they hate each other, they end up loving each other. Price-Thompson does an excellent job of keeping it real and making you feel her characters! At times you want to slap them both, but you keep reading because it's a slice of life and a unique look into the lives of minorities in the military."
5,"""Black Coffe, No Cream ....""","Yummy. Just one word to describe Ms. Thompsons' debut novel. You will absorb it in one sitting! Here's a story where the characters are *very* flawed, who go through some realistic situations, and life isn't always perfect in the end. A fairy tale? Not hardly. Realistic? You betcha. Talk about dialogue that is so on point? I hated for this book to end. If you're tired of stories where perfect people meet perfect people, have a little drama, and everything is happily ever after afterwards -- then this is the story for you.I look forward to future books by this author."
5,Go ARMY!,"Black Coffee by Tracy Price-Thompson was really something. I must admit that after coming online to order it and reading those reviews from Chi-town I wanted to read it even more. I agree when someone said it is the same sad person with no life and no skills writing the reviews. Not only writing them but checking Miss Thompson's reviews and then responding to the ones that call them out like its a message board. This person said Black Coffee should have been better and Mss Thompson should write about something other than the Army. I say Black Coffee was as good as it could have been and I LOVE the military as I have served honorably for 14 years. Although the man and woman were in the service Black Coffee deals with love, family, sisterhood, HIV, absent fathers and guilt. Get a life and find something to do besides slinging mud. Write your own book. More Black Coffee please!"
4,If Loving you is Wrong ......,"You should read this exciting story between Rom and Sandie to see what can go wrong if loving you is wrong ..... You will certainly learn how Sandie came to be the person she was ! A woman after making so many bad choices and deciding not to date a married man. Then Rom says the marriage was over before it started ! He says I'm staying for the sake of my kids. I do not want to be the man my dad is so, I am going to hang on in the loveless marriage ! Then he gets the one he wants and says if loving you is wrong ... then I want to do right ! See what happens when he gets the one he wants !"
4,Page turner!,"Black Coffee is a realistic, thought provoking page turner. This is a great novel, especially since it's the author's first. I enjoy reading new authors. Another novel written by a new author is In-Law Drama. I recommend both novels."
5,Tracy's a Gifted Writer,"I read the first few pages and I was so impressed the way the author had a way with word usage...the way she describes everything...practically in detail... as if the reader was actually there at the scene. While reading the book, I thought the scenes were going one way, then all of a sudden it went another to my surprise. The novel was well written and it is full of drama and action. I hope to read more of Tracy's novels as soon as they come out."
3,Everyone has opinion of Black Coffee.,I too agree that the book Black Coffee was not as good as it could have been.Her book was not as motivational as the title. When a person reads a book it is up to them how much they enjoy an authors writing style every is entitled to their own opinion of the book and no one cares if 19-year daughter read the book or not. Maybe your just an inexperienced reader who has never tried other authors because as you can see her book was not as good as should have been. Maybe you should grow up and realize people young and old are entitled to their views of this book. I truely hope her next book will be about more things than just the army.
3,Black Coffee in the Army,I thought the book was pretty good (although good is so generic). It did not make me want to finish it in a day which is a plus because I commute and I NEED something to read. I was able to get involved with the characters and even talk to them at some point. The author's vast knowledge of the military was important to give the reader a better understanding of just how it fit into the story. I would recommend it to the 35-50 audience.
2,OK but not great,"Elevated heel and not transferrable to other shoes. OK for cushion, but not great, and a bit firm in consistency."
3,"Not great, but not bad either!","I definitely recommend a different book -- not this one to start off with. The drawings are sometimes hard to understand. I have taught ASL to hearing adults and this would not be my first choice to start off with. I liked a different book that I recently reviewed. The title escapes my mind, but check out my other reviews and find the five-star review :)"
1,Learning American Sign Language,"I was very disapointed with the quality of the product, the book was badly mistrated by pass owner, the front and back cover had a big bites, imposible to read the lesson that was containg in this portion of the book. Inside the book in the pages you can see the mark of coffee tropped making dificult to pass the pages smothly.I felt embarase while I was using the book infront of the class. the saler was not honest went he make the advertasing."
3,Good book.... Not recomended for self-study.,Good textbook for an ASL course.Written by experts teaching the ASL.
2,Bad Quality,This is cheaply made and the illustrations are not very clear. This book was a disappointment. I am sure there has to be a better book out there.
3,I wish it came with the DVD...,The book was really good. It included many words that one would use in a normal conversation. I just wish it came with the DVD. I had to buy it separetly.
2,Awful,"When i received this 65.00 hardcover (which it isn't, it looks like spiral cookbook) it was dented and dent and in too small of a box with there items. There is no time for me to return this before the holiday... I am very displeased.. I have never had an issue with an order from Amazon before. Guess there is a first time for everything"
2,learning ASL,It is not what I was looking for. Had a hard time to find the right book I want. Yes I purchase the Learning ASL book and like it.
3,Pros and Cons,"I used this text for my ASL 1 and ASL 2 courses in college, and I think this text was better organized compared to some other texts for learning sign. However, some of the pictures are a bit difficult to decifer and some of the signs are repeated throughout the text. I would like to see the video and the text as a package deal for fifty one dollars, perhaps that would be more worth one's money."
3,Pictures are sometimes confusing,I bought this book for the ASL class I am taking. I missed one week and tried to use the book to teach myself the missed lesson. I did not understand about a third of the diagrams on how to do the different signs. I have seen some sources with explanations to accompany signs which would have made this book much clearer.
3,Well organized but really bad pictures,We used this book as a manuel for my ASL1 and ASL2 class. It was well organized but the pictures are bad and hard to understand. It is not worth the money.
1,Learning American Sign Language,"The book came and was in good enough shape. It was delivered timely, but I purposely paid extra to get the book and the VHS, and only the book was delivered."
3,it'll do,"comments indicated it was in better shape than it arrived in, but it'll serve it's purpose. arrived very timely though!!"
5,for keeps....,The Learning American Sign Language book that I purchased is great. It is detailed and is easy to understand. I am definitely keeping this!
3,"not the best, but not the worst","Some of my complaints include the problematic fact that there are many signs that appear in the dialogues and are not in the vocabulary section, nor illustrated anywhere else, and many of the signs are outdated - one must have a teacher or deaf/hoh person around to help sort it out.Most of the dialogues are pretty boring and inspired me to write a new one which was a very fruitful and a much better learning experience than the book. Also, one of the teachers at Palomar College created a vocabulary video which should be on the dvd that comes with the book.But, on the plus side, the expressions are very good and the signs are clear. The dvd is good and the characters well done tho as I said above, it is missing the vocab signs.Enjoy Dancing Hand Talk! LI"
2,Learning ASL,This is not as easy as they discribe. I'm trying to learn for a new way of life and the DVD and workbook is hard to understand and work with because the DVD goes so fast that its doesn't work with the book.
3,Not the best way to learn Sign language,"This book is a little difficult because you can't tell exactly which way to move your hands by the drawings. The illustrations are not the best, but the composition of the book is good."
4,nice,It came fast and was cheap. Thats all i was looking for. I need eight more words so I wrote this
4,straightforward and simple,"I don't know if there is another ASL text for the hearing out there. I've been assigned this one twice (once in 1996--a much older version--and once this semester). It is simple, straightforward, and easily incorporated into classroom exercises."
4,"Fun Learning with the ""Learning American SIgn Language Book",My daughter and I have both read the book and enjoy practicing what we have learned. It helps to bridge a gap into the deaf world.Learning American Sign Language: Levels I & II--Beginning & Intermediate (2nd Edition) (Spiral-bound)
2,Pretty bad,"As far as a sign language textbook should go, I hope this isn't the standard. I found the hand motions to be confusing despite the pictures (or rather because of them). Some of the exercises are worded so confusingly, making it very unhelpful. Not worth the $60 I paid."
2,One Dimensional,It's too confusing. There's one picture and you can't tell really which way your hands should be positioned. There should at least be a written description.
5,Excellent Overview of Bruce Gilden's earliest work,"""Coney Island"" is a splendid collection of photographer Bruce Gilden's first important fine art documentary photography project, depicting the denizens of Coney Island. As such it is a vivid exploration of his early career as one of New York City's - and the world's - foremost street photographers (He is currently a member of Magnum Photos, the distinguished photojournalism agency.). Stylistically, there is some resemblance to work by other noted photographers such as Bruce Davidson and William Klein, but I suspect the most important influence is that from his teacher, Lisette Model. This is a long-overdue collection of Bruce's earliest work and hopefully it will remain in print."
5,Shape Up for Super Sex,"This book was the best darn book I ever read(and used) to get into shape. It actually helped me obtain the shape I wanted to have; to obtain the shape most women want to have. It's too bad it's no longer in print. Sure, the language was a little spicy, but not too spicy by today's standards. I feel, if even a prude like myself could handle it, than it wouldn't be too embaracing for anyone who REALLY wanted to get into shape. I wish I could have found my own copy. I want to get back into that kind of shape again. The pictures gave you a clear idea of how the excercises were meant to be done; the discriptions of the excercises were very educational,and fun,as well. I haven't seen a magazine in years that has been that precise, yet informative. It would be nice if they could put this book back into print. I'm married and want to stay that way. I feel a better looking woman makes a more confident woman,and a more confident;yet well- rounded woman,is sexier."
3,used for PE exam,I used this book for PE exam. I mostly used it for morning questions and I would say if you are taking enviromental/water PE afternoon it would probably be good. Morning part questions were simple and afternoon part I didn't use. ( I took transportation for afternoon)
3,Not Much Animation Info Here,"I agree with some of the negative reviews about this book. I was actually surprised it was rated so highly. Don't get me wrong, it's an ok book, but a large majority of the book covers character design or talks about things other than actual animation. The previous reviewer was absolutely correct that there really isn't much info on animation in this book. There is some good beginning info here, especially on the walk/run cycles, and some decent info on character reactions and stuff.Also, most of the animation is geared towards very ""cartoony"" animation like Bugs Bunny and that kind of thing, which is of course great, but many people want to do more realistic animations of people walking, talking, moving, etc. and this book doesn't really provide much of that.It's not a bad book, but if you've already got books on character design or drawing cartoons, then this book isn't going to be much help."
2,"Cartoon Animation, Good, and then Not so good.","I read this book, I figured it would be great. WellI was kinda wrong. It was ok in some areas, like the study of the walk and run. But it didn't have enough on animation, the segments were very short and did not explain them very well. This is an ""Ok"" book, but it could of been better"
4,An excellent reference work for animators and students.,"I first found this book several years ago after reading the excellent Disney Animation- The Illusion of Life (Now called The Illusion of Life: Disney Animation) by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnson. This book covers several topics that the Disney book doesn't, such as lip-syncing. An animation teacher at DeAnza College in Cupertino has made this book a requirement, and I understand why. Don't think of this book as the only instruction you will need to become an animator, but buy a copy of it so you can have helpful reminders about important animation techniques without having to flip through hundreds of pages. This book is an excellent companion to the Disney book."
5,Great Book and a must have for animators,This book come in handy and covers all of the basic principals of animation and if you are in the animation industry i really recomend you get it
5,Cartoon animation,A wonderful reference for drawing cartoons and learning how to animate. Preston blair was just a wonderful artist and animator. It's really worth buying it.
5,"All I needed to know, except how to draw","I can't think of a better place to learn how to translate drawing skills into animation. This book assumes you already know how to draw people (and animal characters), but don't know how to draw them in animated sequences. It mainly talks about traditional cel animation, but the techniques apply to other styles, from flip books to computer animation (though mainly 2D).The details of getting the animation drawings from art to film are outside the scope of the book, but lots of other books do a good job of explaining that. _Animation from Script to Screen_ by Shamus Culhane is a good book for that part of the process (and also covers _some_ of the same artistic ground this one does). Leaving out the technical details allows to book to cover a lot more about the important part: drawing animated characters."
5,PRESTON BLAIR IS A GENIUS,"This book is the quintessential book to read when starting your animating career! Even when you're a successful animator you can still go back to this book to learn or reinterpret keypoints that you may not have understood before. Iam 15 and have just began animating and this book makes the animating process a cake walk. If I every make it big in the animating business I will make sure to give credit to one man, Preston Blair."
4,GReat Book,"This is a great book for those who start in te animation. It's very easy to understand the basics of character construction, but don't expect to find the answer to all the problems in it. It's a beginers book, and a very usefur reference guide.The binding is not very good, you have to be careful when handling, but is well-printed. Good price, cheap."
2,Bill in Albany,"The book is too basic even for a first semester programming class. Running the code in Dos, come on, no new programmers are being taught that as their primary run environment at colleges anymore. I supervise the CIS/IT tutoring lab at a small college and working with the VB.Net Studio environment is one of the toughest things for students to learn. Also, with the current growth in XML students, learning VB.Net in the Studio IDE is all the more important. This is a decent ""third"" book to have on the subject. The author knows his stuff, he just didn't write it well or enough of it. Lastly, one other reviewer said his vb coding went back 7 years and he loved this book. Must've been the best man at the author's wedding."
3,If had decent basket looms would be great.,Made in China quality. Good cord and sockets. Female socket at the end of line is an added bonus. The little metal hooks for hanging are a nice touch. But the basket looms are very cheap plastic and most were broken either at the hinge point (75%) or where they connect to the socket (20%). Baskets require assembly onto the sockets. 20 little screws come with it for that. The clip to connect the two haves of the basket looms for changing bulbs was difficult to get fastened.
5,save you money,"great to forget about watering your garden, easy to install and easy program. great option for watering systems, i use it in my orbit watering system. it is adjustable and different range of rain water levels."
1,"may be great, but not with toro controller.","I don't know if this is good or not. I bought because it also had the freeze sensor, but it did not work, basically was on when should have been off and vice versa. Called orbit, helpful, but found that it won't work with Toro controller which operates the opposite. so they need to make this clear."
3,The sensor would stay triggered no more than 10 hours.,"I bought this sensor and tried it several times under spring rain. The sensor will be triggered by the rain, but it took a while (about a half hour heavy rain) to start. That causes a lot of waste of water if your system happened to start during this time. I guess this is the shortcoming of this type (disc expansion) of rain sensor. In addition, the sensor supposedly can stay on for a period of 1 or 2 days depends on the evaporation setting on the sensor. I set the evaporation window to fully closed in order to test the longest delay time. After several heavy rains, the sensor can only stay on for no more than 10 hours. That means 10 hours later after a heavy rain, the system can still start to water your lawn. I am disappointed about this sensor. Nevertheless, the sensor looks pretty solid, and sleek."
1,Bad product,"I purchased this from Amazon because it was less expensive than at Home Depot, but when I received it, I found that it was not the same. The one from Amazon had its cord cut and spliced with a speaker wire, which is not suitable, so I returned it. Besides being speaker wire, the place where the original cord and the speaker wire is spliced is sloppily done. It was a waste of shipping fees to receive it and return it, but it was not useable. Normally, I have been very happy with the products I have purchased on Amazon, but I guess the odds caught up to me on this one."
1,rain sensor,only works for a few hours after rain even when set to lowest amount with window closed its junk! Soaked in water and measured disk expansion very slow to expand.
1,Does not work at all,"I purchased this item in conjunction with an Orbit 9 Station timer.The disks do-not expand when wet, this does not work at all.The micro switch works, as a test I placed the disks in water for 2 hours with no effect.I wonder how it can even be marketed as a rain sensor.Extremely disappointed please save your money."
2,MS Outlook Sync Problems,"I spent two hours with MIO Tech Support figuring out why the MIO C520 was importing the address from my Outlook incorrectly. Finally, the Tech specialist told me that I have uncovered a known bug and the MIO is working on it. If it was a known bug, why did they keep me on the phone for two hours? I wonder how many of the professional reviewers (CNET etc) actually tried importing their contacts. The C520 is close to a year old, how much more time do they need to correct a fundamental bug which affects their marketing and sales pitch directly. If you want to use your Outlook with your GPS, stay away from this product."
3,Mio C520 Hard to See - Many Features,"The first C520 I purchased had a power supply problem (probably with the DC cord) and failed within a few hours of use. The replacement has not exhibited any of those problems.I purchased the Mio because of it's larger screen size and lower cost. Many skins are available online, so you're not stuck with the format the manufacturer devised. I've tried several of these skins, but none give a bigger view of roads and locations like the Garmins and Magellans. With my 61 year old eyes, I'm beginning to think a GPS with less features and larger graphics is the way to go. My other GPSs are IWays. I particularly like the IWay 550 - a very large and bright screen (it does overheat at times, though).If you like to tinker with your GPS, the Mio C520 is for you."
3,soso product,"Not that user friendly.I'm living in bay area. It lost me several times. I seldom need to use a GPS.. more correctly .. never! I always look at the google map and I know how to get there, but this GPS is really confusing sometimes.Moreover, I don't like the text-to-speech content...for example.. instead of calling 101 - highway 101, it will say bayshore highway. and 92 will be another name that I can never remember cause no one here will use that.I'm going to get rid of this one and try another."
4,Great little GPS!,"Does a great job of getting you from point A to point b. Ability to add multiple vias a plus. Suction windshield mount works well. Display more informative then most(even at a quick glance), text to speech works very well. Is it perfect? No, it does get a little to chatty for my liking, showing POI's of your choice in split screen requires extra steps that should be done by a passenger or done in a stopped vehicle. All in all I'm quite satisfied with the purchase and have recomended it to others looking for a good GPS unit."
3,Mapping is not as accurate as I would have liked,"I really think the hardware and UI was well thought out. However I wound up returning it because the actual mapping software had many serious flaws. A) several streets in my area were mis-named. B) more than once (in a week's time) it routed me through roads that did not exist. That would be disasterous in strange surroundings. C) My Garmin handheld has more and more accurate Points Of Interest.I really wanted to like it because of all of the features and the price, but ultimately it came down to the mapping... which is what I purchased it for."
1,Good Product UNTIL I UPGRADED THE MAPS,"This was an OK unit until I updated the map and firmware from a disk I purchased from MIO. First of all I was very surprised to find the 'Update' on the disk has 2007 maps on it even thought we are in 2009. Not 1 road changed in this software that I have seen yet.The other major problem that started happening is the unit now reboots whenever it feels like it. I have spoken 3 times with customer service and all I get is ""Send it in for $80 to have it fixed"". So I am supposed to pay for their bad programming..I don't think so. The last two calls I made I was told they are forwarding my request to management. Well they told me that 3 weeks ago, and I never got a returned call.If I were you I would stay away from MIO until they can get better customer service. I know my next GPS will probably be a Garmin, I hear there Customer Service is good."
2,Poor routing algorithm,"After using the Mio C520 for over 3 months now I truly regret I bought it. the device performs poorly in route calculation choosing the most bizarre routes you would ever imagine.Fortunately also owned a Garmin 200W and the TomTom One. both outperform the Mio in suggesting much faster and more logical routes. THIS IS THE MOST BASIC FUNCTION OF A GPS DEVICE!The bluetooth speakerphone is useless as there's so much background noise. besides, you have to pair the phone each time you turn the Mio on.Overall nice feature/function but poor design, stay away!"
3,Mio 520,"The Mio 520 has the best points of interest POI, in the business. The screen display is not very good, mapping is okay, not as good as the Magellen, tom tom or Garmain POI is very important to me, I can learn to live with some of the other short comings"
5,Fast to schedule,"The selle re schedulle the delivery very fast, and i received in the new time that he told me."
1,C520 can not connect with IPHONE,"I gave MIO C520 ZERO point because C520 can not connect to IPHONE. The only reason I purchased C520 is I want to use bluetooth handsfree function in C520. I have a C310 so I do not care the improvement of C520 in map function. If you do not believe me, just check the google, you will find a lot information about C520's bugs of bluetooth function. Do not buy this!!!"
1,GPS MIO C520 Review,Product worked great for 1 week then the Map software somehow got corrupt and the system stopped working. Sent unit back for refund.
1,"Bad company, bad shipping, no refund","Got an email saying the product was out of stock and I would receive credit, so I order another one, then the product came they charged me agani, I sent the product back for credit, then they returned to me, then I returned again, that was weeks ago and I am still waiting for a credit, CAR TOYS SUCKS! DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!"
3,Simply Okay,"I was happy with the price I paid. However, The GPS is simply okay. I am not too excited about it. It could not find some of the addresses. It could be an easy fix by updating the maps software (I do not know how to do it). It also pointed to a wrong address once. Since then, I always print out the maps either from yahoo or google, just to be sure."
3,Adequate Product,"I ordered this product just before Christmas and overall it is a good enough GPS. There are a couple of quirks in terms of how it navigates off the beaten track and it frequently recalculates. Mio does not offer map updates at the moment. It tends to take the long route when you eliminate highway routes. The battery power leaves a lot to be desired as it will not work very long without it being plugged into a power source. It is sleek machine with a lot of features. For a first GPS, I am fairly pleased with it, especially for the price."
4,Good GPS for the price...,this is good one in the form of recalculation with any other GPS.....but lack of some map updates.....
2,Great feature for the price BUT....,"Alot of the reviews about features for the money are something I would agree with. I would give this product 5 stars, except for 2 things. The maps are woefully outdated(almost 2 years old). That has proven to be a big problem. That, combined with the fact that support is a 3rd party call center in India(probably also taking calls for the veg-0-matic) having absolutly no clue on when a map update would happen, makes this a 2 star product in my opinion. At least with Garmin and the others you know they are going to come out with updates."
4,Excellent quality at low price,Bought this item for my mother. She loves it. Directions are on que. Only bad thing I can say is the manual is on a cd. Would be more helpful to have a book.
2,Routing is not that good,"Thin and sleek design, good features(bluetooth handsfree, mp3 player, picture viewer, video player...but that is not you want in a GPS...You need efficient routing...The GPS routing is not that good...ok my trip to lake tahoe took me through a hilly and extremely steep route, (hwy89)that is not what google says or Garmin says..no matter wat ever routing parameters you set it still took me through that route....we had three cars and all with different GPS..one with Google Maps...one with Garmin and One with the Mio C520....I was apparently 50 miles behind the others because of the hilly route that it told me to take....my overall experience with this GPS is very disappointing..."
2,Great Features but Poor Routing,"I tried C520 for a week around Houston and found the routing to be poor. Instead of keeping me on 59 Frwy for 17 miles straight, it was routing me off and on this freeway and around downtown unnecessarily. On one stretch it kept asking me to take the ramp to get on 59N while I was already on it. Maybe it thought the old (2+ years) construction detours were still there. I returned this (C City with 15% restock penalty) and got a Garmin Nuvi 350 which worked perfect on the same routes.Other features on C520 were superb - good user interface, clear large display with a lot of useful information, clear voice instructions. But it failed in its primary function to provide accurate navigation."
3,Some good/some bad,"The unit works fairly well, but could be improved. Gets me to my destinations, but sometimes via obscure routes. For instance, when I am returning home, even when I turn onto my street about 1/2 mile from my house, it still does numerous ""route recalculations"" to try to get me to use a parallel street until I am less than a block from my house. Next, the touch screen buttons could be a little larger - it sometimes takes several taps to get the screen to change. Also, receiving telephone calls via the MIO is a delight, but it's a much more complicated process to initiate a call - could have been made simpler. Lastly, having to disconnect the unit as recommended before starting the car each time is a drag. Overall, I like the unit but it sometimes seems like the designers didn't actually drive around with one in their cars at all. Otherwise, they would have corrected a few of these glitches."
3,Decent,"This unit does has a lot of functions, including bluetooth, and the ability to play many other files.Compare to my old Garmin Street Pilot i5, I like the large, touch screen of Mio C520. The screen on the C520 is bright enough to read during the day but not too bright during the night, which is a plus. It is also easier to type in an address on the C520 compare to the i5.The only complain I have about the C520 is that it doesn't give very good driving directions. Sometimes, I don't know why C520 makes me go in a roundabout ways instead of the most direct route. Other than that, I can't find anything else not to like about this unit."
4,Mio C520 - a great value,"A fine portable car navigator. My second experience after 3 years with a Magellan Road Mate. I enjoy the cable-less versatility and the ability to pocket it when leaving the car. -- The Magellan was stolen, because the bracket was in plain sight.--This unit has too many features to name, and the only detractor is, if anything, too much information. It calls by yards every turn.A superior buy."
4,Good windshield coverage,Rhis windshield shade provides very good coverage. It is a bit difficult to fold up and store but worth it for excellent sun protection.
3,Sherlock Holmes in Brazil?,"I have the sneaky feeling that this book was written tongue-in-cheek. Having Sherlock Holmes summoned from England by the Emperor of Brazil to come to his country and solve the mystery of the theft of a valuable violin far exceeds the imagination stretching required in this situation. Also, making Watson the complete bumbler (just as Nigel Bruce played him in the Basil Rathbone movies) does real damage to his image, and is really not in conformance with his character as set out in the novels and stories.Also, we have Sherlock falling in love and acting like a smitten schoolboy, which is so far from his character that it's almost ridiculous! All of that having been said, the book was somewhat fun to read and I learned a lot of Brazilian history. If you aren't a Holmes stickler you might enjoy this book; if you are, stay as far away from it as possilbe!"
5,"Try, It' the best book that was ever made.",I don't agree with those people that said it' the worst book that ever made. Try you will love it. Force somebody to read including you.
1,Not for Sherlockians,"As a Sherlockian, this book disgusted and repulsed me. If it was meant to be a joke, I certainly did not get it. Almost as inexcusable as the rape of Doyle's characters was the blatent rip-off of Hannibal Lector. This book must have lost A LOT in translation and Soares should think twice about introducing any more of his novels to America. It may have worked in Brazil, but it didn't go over well with many Americans."
3,A Stadivarius and a serial killer,"Brazilian author J Soares does what many authors do: brings the Great Detective to their home location.Sarah Bernhardt is on tour in Brazil, when a Stradivarius is stolen from a friend of the Emperor. The Divine One suggests that her friend, Sherlock Holmes, would be useful in recovering it. Dom Pedro telegraphs Holmes, but in the meantime a prostitute is killed and a flap of skin is removed. But the killer leaves a violin string curled in her pubic hair.Mr. Soares is a fairly good and amusing writer, although I did get a little tired of the truth behind Holmes' deductive feats (that he is wrong, and no one has the heart to tell him).An interesting book, and one worth reading you prefer your Sherlock Holmes a little distant from the standard portrayal of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. And the ending is quite interesting, too."
5,"If you are a Sherlock fan, stay away or enjoy the joke...","I've read the other reviews on this book, and i'm sad to see that 90% of the North American readers (myself included) bought this book expecting a traditional Holmes adventure. I have to admit that as soon as i got into this reading i noticed this could not be serious...so, i decided to read it as a joke, and guess what: it was not bad at all, in fact, it was a very entertaining book, full of humor and extremely light reading... I'm a big Holmes fan, but the people who rated this book as being the worst ever writen with the character of Sherlock Holmes are idiots who treat a ficcional character as a religion! Folks, Sherlock Holmes never existed, ok? The reviews i read about this book are the type of reviews you can expect from a bunch of Catholic priests reading Carl Sagan...sorry i had to read those, the book is awesome!"
3,a good light read,"I like to think of Soares as a comedic Gore Vidal. The basic tension in this book comes from throwing a famous, eccentric, British aristocrat into a world where characters don't act like they do in England, like a comedic version of the Holmes story which takes place in Utah. For what it is, entertainment, it's fine, but hardly 5 star literature."
1,Excuse me while I go puke....,"I cannot even begin to express how utterly disgusted I was with this book. Sherlock Holmes has been torn to shreds in this book where he portrays a blubbering lovesick idiot. And Watson's character was rather moronic too. Parts of this book read like a tedious textbook and others like a trashy romance novel. The humor was dull and old. If you're a dedicated Sherlockian, you'd best avoid this book. However, if you are looking for a perfect Sherlock read - get Laurie King's Mary Russell series. Best books I've read in my whole life!"
1,"An infantile, sophmoric yawn","I can't say how much I hated this book, so I won't even try. The author (and I use this word generously) has trouble hiding ancient jokes told in high school as literature. He also tries to hide out-right plagarism (the scene when Holmes visits a canibal in the mental hospital is identical to the scene in which Hannibal Lector is visited in Silence of the Lambs). The killer turns out to be Jack the Ripper. Gee, how many other Sherlock spin-offs have a Jack the ripper Killer (see, for instance, the movie Murder by Decree). When discussing bad books in the 21st century, there will be two groups: those who have read A Samba for Sherlock, and those who have not read A Samba for Sherlock"
1,A big disappointment,"Jo Soares toys with the character of Sherlock Holmes, to the point of disrespect. The writing is high-schoolish and lazy, and decidedly not due to the exercise of translation from the Brazilian original. Anecdotes that have been told previously were thrown into this story line, including a second-rate joke about a snake recalled as an episode in Holmes life. The situations are unconnected, clues to the mystery appear from implausible events, and Holmes uses none of his abilities in this work, except perhaps to draw attention to a first book by Soares that would otherwise be cast aside, as it should be. Stay away from this book if you are a Holmes fan, or if you are a fan of passable story telling."
1,Truly Awful.,"From all the books I've read in the past five years, this has got to be the worst one. It's simply awful. I've almost had to have my hands tied behind my back to resist the urge of tossing it into a flame. It's that bad. I've read the book in its native tongue, and I don't know how the translation came up, but the book was bad enough by then. Try it only if you really need to."
1,The title is misleading.,"The title for this book in Brazil is ""O Xango de Backer Street"", which would be translated as ""The Backer Street's Xango"". It is a shame that the title in English got the reference to Sherlock Holmes, which can only be explained by deliberate greed to attract more readers. It is a shame, because the book is a joke in every sense."
1,A Samba for Sherlock---DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"I have read some terrible travesties using the characters created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle before, but this trash from Brazil is without doubt the worst. This ""author"" could not even get the color of Holmes eyes right, let alone the ""comedy"" he tries so hard to force upon us, making Holmes and Watson out to be the stupidest creatures ever to crawl out of England. And, to top it off, he has Holmes as a lusting, drooling fool who cannot deduce anything related to the multiple murders in the story because he is so in love with a second rate actress that he goes to bed with, etc. PLEASE, do yourself a favor and skip this insult."
5,Everyone loves it!,The Little Book of Wisdom is great. I love to flip to random pages and read the quotes. It always makes me smile. I have yet to be disappointed! It is also a great gift. Everyone loves it!
3,Techy groove worth hearing...,"I stumbled on Wave Workers Foundation on MP3.com back in the day, and was surprised and pleased by the two tracks one could download there: Bellows Grin, and In the Whirlpool. These remain the best tracks on the album- polished, rich and driving.But the album version of of Bellows Grin is missing the vocals that were on the MP3.com track... It's odd for a fan of instrumentals like myself to make such a complaint, but WWF does a great job of weaving rich, bassy vocals into their rich bassy tracks (as In the Whirlpool demonstrates).The rest of the album is interesting stuff, but if you don't get a chance to listen to it before buying, try to get a used copy until there aren't any available. Let's hope WWF continues to develop and release new material though!"
1,Aaaaak! It cracked!,"I received the Brown Betty from my children for a Christmas gift and I was so excited. I washed the pot and got ready to make my first pot of tea. As I poured the boiling water into the pot, I heard these little clink, clink sounds. After the 4th pot of tea, I saw many, many fine cracks on the outside and inside of the pot. I had really hoped that this pot would be my ""workhorse"" teapot, but I don't think so."
1,brown betty,"The spout leaks when you pour the tea, dripping all over the place which is not how a Brown Betty should perform.Almost feels like I have a second. Disappointed with the product. If it had been bought in a store I wouldhave returned it."
2,Good for 18 months only,"Aloha...I read all the reviews before ordering this teapot eighteen months ago and have been carefully warming the pot before adding boiling water and generally treating it with TLC. Alas, today, as I was filling it with warm water before the kettle boiled, I felt a roughness on the side and looked carefully and it was crazed all over the outside. I don't know how much longer it will last before it goes to pieces, but I really don't want to take a chance. It seems a dangerous prospect. I'm really disappointed as it has served me well, but I did expect a longer acquaintance."
2,A bit disappointing,"I've purchased several of these Brown Bettys over the years. I was a bit disappointed with the latest one as it had several defects in the pottery itself. It's almost as if it were a ""second"". For the price, I would have expected more... For the record, I also bought a similar pot which was made in Malaysia. It was perfect. And about a third the price."
2,brown betty teapot,This pot is so heavy that I can barely lift it when it is full of water. I use it but I have to lift the silly thing with two hands.
4,Who goofed?,"The supplier did his best but the deliverer really screwed up on this one.It was like ""nobody is in charge"" for many days until the deliverer finally got his act together. Amazon, you should have better control over what comes from others.Fred Shippee"
2,"Indeed, the new Brown Betty pots are cheap junk","My second 8 cup Brown Betty broke tonight. Two handles have broken off, very dangerous when lifting a big pot of scalding hot tea. Also the second one's spout dripped terribly when pouring. The clay and glaze is misshapen, uneven, and blotchy--shoddy work.I am now convinced that the ""new and improved, under new ownership"" Brown Betty teapots are cheapened flimsy tourist junk for people who want a piece of British history. But for a strong workhorse daily teapot, these are probably not up to the task, even verging on being a safety hazard.The handle snaps clean off a heavy pot of scalding water??? C'mon people..."
2,Handle uncomfortable,I was excited to get this teapot since my English grandmother always used one of these. I found this pot to have a very uncomfortable handle - even empty. Couldn't imagine how awkward it would be full of water.
4,"Not Nobuo Uematsu, but still Final Fantasy music","The name Nobuo Uematsu is so synonymous with the fantastic musical scores of the Final Fantasy series that to not see his name on a soundtrack is something of a shock.Yet the music of Final Fantasy Tactics is not the typical Final Fantasy score. Whereas most titles in the series rely on a mixture of melodic themes, dramatic action sequences, and brooding, dark overtures, composers Hitoshi Sakimoto and Masaharu Iwata treat listeners to a selection of what may best be described as epic themes. Reflecting the broad storyline of the game itself, their music is perfectly mated to the game.Listeners ultra-loyal to the Uematsu conceptualization of Final Fantasy music may find this soundtrack somewhat strange, but the score stands on its own legs and offers a wonderful alternative to the typical Final Fantasy fare."
3,Slot Smarts: Winning Strategies At The Slot Machine,"This book would have received higher ""stars"", however, the author is too moralistic in preaching on the perils of slot playing. There is too much information in this book that the average slot player is already aware of. The book was disappointing from this stand point. I did use the author's spreadsheet to enable better tracking for my future slot sessions. Frankly, the book is overpriced for the knowledge gleaned."
4,Solid Ideas..Excess Verbage,"Since the slots make up the majority of opportunity to gamble in Las Vegas...it is a pleasure to see an updated (late 1990's) but not overly technical guide to what the games are and how to understand the logic behind their operation in order to ""win"" or at least break even. Though I have not had the full resources to completely test Mr Halcombe's methods...about 80% of the information he imparts, I have used at one point or another to wind up being considerably ahead at the dollar slots. Some of the text could have been shortened as pertains to the moral or philosophical views of slot play....but overall...an invaluable read if you are going to put even one dollar in the machines."
4,Good strategies for those new to slot money management.,I read this short book in one night. The strategies for playing the machines are well documented and easy to follow. My only complaint is too much time repeating the basics of limiting your gambling to money you can afford to lose and limiting your expectations for profit--we all know that I hope. But I'm going to try the strategies on my next trip to the casinos and I'll let you know if they work then...
3,A bit difficult to understand,Perhaps it's a bit unreasonable to expect reviews on newer machines but I didn't get as much out of this book as expected. I got the basic concept but it wasn't that easy to understand.
2,Warning! A totally different sound,"I was kinda disappointed when I heard this record the first time. I bought it because I liked ""be on go"" (1st track) which is an awesome ambient track. but the other tracks are...well too funky, there are a lot of strange sounds instead of an interesting hook line and plenty of ethnic samples - now they sound like what the name of the band implies :-). Well it's not absolutely horrible, but totally different in comparison with their previous album ""Alien Protein"". So if you are looking for the old Etnica sound, go buy the new Pleiadians album."
5,Does what it has to do,"This product is good.We have a home business, and leave the shop sometimes unattended.The distance we use, between the buttons and the chime is about 30 - 40 foot. And it works perfect."
1,Doorbell,The doorbell did not function. I purchased new batteries to see if that was the problem but that did not work either. Followed troubleshooting instructions and didn't seem to work.I do not recommend this product
4,Cordless door bell that didn't work,I have to say that is was rather frusturating at first. I say this because after taking the item out and reading the instructions on the set up I quickly found it didn't work. After quite a few minutes of frustration of the door bell not working I was fortune it ennough to have some of the same batteries that came with the door bell. So after installing the ones I had it worked. Makes me wonder how long this particular item sat on the shelf as both batteries were dead that came with it. It works fine and truly enjoy it. The item itself is very nice and would recommend it although you might want to have an extra set of batteries.
2,plug in door chime,"Unfortunately, the chime worked once only. I don't know if the product is old or defective. I'd appreciate a replacement. Thank you."
3,Somewhat disappointed...,"Heath Zenith SL-6142-C Basic Wireless Plug-In Door Chime with Two Transmitters, WhiteAs a previous reviewer pointed out, the amazon.com product review was deceiving. Not only did it state misinformation about the D-batteries (but that's okay because I wanted a plug-in) but it also said this had 3 tones that included Westminster Chimes. This model only as TWO tones - a ding and a ding-dong. And the tones are tinny sounding. Also, the battery was dead that came with one of the pushbuttons, so I have to fork out for a new one and they're hard to find in a retail store because of their odd size.Having said all that, this will work out for now as it was a temporary solution until I can get my wired doorbell fixed."
1,No stars for this one...,"Blew up in less than 10 days. Smoke and all. To be fair, electricity in our country is pretty bad, but my house is setup with a number of protections (such as power inverters, for example). My guess is that the item does not take the pseudo-sinusoid wave produced by the inverter when no external power was available (most inverters produce a square wave that is different to that of the regular A/C current).In any case... going back to a battery-operated unit."
5,A Major Television Event,"When NBC first showed ""V,"" no one knew what to expect. It turned out to be a science fiction allegory of Nazi Germany as portrayed by alien visitors. The Jewish people were replaced with scientists being villified by our new ""friends."" The saucers, which will remind you of those from ""Independence Day,"" look awesome hovering over the world's cities. More diabolical in tone and execution than ""ID4,"" ""V"" made a profound statement about the freedoms that we take for granted.On DVD, Warner Bros. has gone back and pulled out the widescreen films. Yes, it was shot in widescreen format and is presented that way here for the first time in the USA.The second miniseries wasn't nearly as effective as this. And the weekly series that followed was iffy. But the original is an amazing piece of television history."
4,Classic SF miniseries,"It's a bit cheesy. Remember, it's formatted to fit your TV! But, it's ambitions make it quite enjoyable. This is a time when people were scared of a nuclear war with the Russians, and this miniseries (along with things like The Day After) played on this fear.Much of the concept, and the first half hour of plot, is straight out of Arthur C. Clarke's classic novel Childhood's End. At least they gave him credit by mentioning him in a newscast. I think it's great they could introduce this classic story to the masses.It soon departs from Clarke's story, however, and weaves its own. They clearly wanted to cover socially relevant themes, such as teen pregnancy and the Holocaust. They also threw in a little soap opera bickering. Mix it all together with a few great second-rate actors (what would a bad movie be without Michael Ironside?) and what have you got? A classic SF miniseries."
1,Disappointed,I loved the '83 original V miniseries. I just want to know....where is the rest of the 6 hr. miniseries???? This item is only 196 minutes!!! We didn't even see the monster baby born. Please tell me that there is a disk somewhere with the rest of the series......
2,Disappointed,"Well I am unfortunately not going to buy this DVD. I loved the series but am very disappointed after reading the reviews here. It seems like they did a good job of transferring it to DVD but they cut all the scenes with ""Robin"" in it. To me this just doesn't seem like a complete DVD plus it leaves you with a cliff hanger at the end of it. Oh well I guess I'll pass on it."
1,DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT NEW FROM AMAZON!,Twice I have ordered it from Amazon and the case is being shipped with the WRONG DVD in it! They tell me they are working on getting it straightened out now.I have re-ordered used from another seller...
2,V-The Original TV Miniseries DVD,"This DVD is NOT THE COMPLETE MINI-SERIES. The teenager gets pregnant, Has A Child. None of this is even on this DVD. Don't bother to waste your $$$$. It isn't worth owning/ I'm sending mine back."
1,V the sci-fi miniseries,I was very disappointed in the DVD V. It cut out a lot of the miniseries including the birth of the twin mixed breed and the exellent ending of the surviving twin that stood for peace. Am I missing something here? is there a second DVD with this ending and the missing scenes? Or did they just cut a hell of a lot out to fit it all on one DVD???
2,I Would Give 5 Stars But...,"Dont't get me wrong, I LOVE this movie. I remember wathching it on tv. But, I always remember the FINAL BATTLE. It was the best part. Just as you get to the end of this DVD, your ready to watch them kick some Butt, then you remember, opps thats it!? So you have to pop in the old VCR tape, and watch the grainey picture and sound. I hope that WB comes out with the Final Battle, for I don't know how much longer my VCR tape can Take!"
4,Good show. Bad special effects.,"When I was a kid, I used to be big fan of the series. That's the reason I let nostalgia do it's thing and bought ""V: Original TV Miniseries"" (let's call it Part 1), ""V The Final Battle"" (Part 2) and ""V: The Complete Series"" (Part 3). The first two sets are the best: they have intelligent plots, well-constructed characters and a cast pretty-enough to ensure happy viewers. The problem is that the special effects are terrible. And when it comes to the third set (V: The Complete Series), it looks like the producers kinda lost the angle, since it is more predictable and broke many of the rules they had for the first two. For example, on this one, aliens don't have the strange voice they used to in the first two. Anyway, it's a good thing they are releasing a remake of the series later on this year."
2,What is this?!?!,"I bought this DVD because I loved this movie, and once had it on tape, and lost it in a move recently. I am very upset and disappointed that the final battle is missing! What the hell is this?!?! This is the only reason I am rating it a 2! I would have paid the extra money to get the final battle with it as well. How the hell do you end a movie like they did on this DVD?!?! Otherwise, it gets a five."
5,V THE ORIGINAL TV MINISERIES,"I USED TO WATCH THIS WHEN IT WAS ON TV, WHEN I SEEN IT ON HERE I JUST HAD TO BUY IT. AND I'M GLAD I DID IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION, STILL IN PLASTIC. DVD'S WORKED VERY WELL I WAS VERY PLEASED."
5,Makes ID4 Look Like Gilligan's Island,Great show...the acting and writing are wonderful. Marc Singer again turns in a geat performance. Then again every performance Marc Singer gives is spectacular. The man can act!!Jane Badler and Faye Grant are very good as well. Get this.The director's commentary is very informative.
5,V: The Miniseries,"Fantastic - better than the current Series. However, Must see V: The Final Battle to complete the Miniseries."
4,They're Here,"The original V miniseries was one of my favorite shows when I was younger,my parents before me had gottne to see it when it first aired and for that I will always be jealous. I recommend this to any hardcore sci-fi freak."
4,V miniseries review,"I loved it when I first saw it on TV in the 1980s. I'm glad to finally have it on DVD. It's still good today even though FX may be cheap compared to today, but story is still good and relevant today."
4,Misleading advertising,"Having been a fan of V for years, i can remember watching this on TV when i was 9 ( i am 23 now). I fell in love with the series and taped them all, then bought the VHS and now the DVD. I felt that the advertising on the cover was misleading as i thought it contained the full original Mini -Series, including The Final Battle.However that doesn't mean i didn't think it was value for money at all. I just need to know when the other DVDs are coming out as i cannot wait to buy them.Personally, i would advise anyone to purchase this Mini-Series and Final Battle,..."
5,V is for victory of good story,"The series V the mini series and V the final batte were a lot of fun really good mini series and the story could have continued to be more. The story was good when it aired, and just as good today. Perhaps some of the scifi aspects from the 80's are not up to the standards of todays tech, but since this mini series is well acted and relies more on story then special effects it makes it great to watch at any time."
1,Lone Voice of Criticism,"I realize I am the lone voice of critism in this list of reviews, but if I can save one person from wasting their time with this movie, I'll be happy.My family--the youngest being 11 years old--was fascinated with how stilted the dialogue was, how unrealistically stupidly the humans' reacteds were, and how weak was the overall emotional impact.Maybe in the 80's it had impact because the 80's were such a wasteland entertainment-wise, and re-watching this series engenders sentimental feelings for those who had nothing better back then. Maybe because we had never seen it before and have been spoiled by truly inspirational tales such as Independence Day, and excellent acting and writing found in the X-Files. I don't know how to explain it, but I can't imagine that anyone would highly recommend this movie. I say watch it only to experience how bad television can be."
2,Be Real - mediocre at best ....,"The insignia on the uniforms look like swastikas, they recruit young humans as SS. Hardly create by any sense of the imagination. I saw this in the '80's and was not impressed, only with the amount of money spent to make it."
1,V - The Original TV Miniseries,"I cannot rate this review because the movie never reached me. The package reached me but the movie inside was not V - The Original TV Miniseries, the movie inside the package was Mr. Roberts. I did not order Mr. Roberts, I ordered V - The Original TV Miniseries. I have put the package back in the mail to you with return to sender on it since the person I spoke with had not sent me the return shipment lable which was promised. I hope my order for the Fourth Season of Charmed comes correctly. I will not be ordering from Amazon again once the Fourth Season of Charmed reaches my doorstep. Thank you for listening."
1,bad disc,side a played very well then when went to play side b was given an error message saying nat a playable disc very dissapointed.
3,Pretty Good for Old TV!!,"This TV miniseries was pretty good for the time. The special effects in Star Trek blow it away now. But if you want to see what TV sci-fi used to look like, this is a good example. The story concepts are as old as sci-fi as well."
3,5 Star Movie... BUT....,"I'll start out by saying that this is one of the best made for TV shows ever and is up there in rank along with Shogun and The Thorn Birds... BUT... There is a problem with this DVD.. It's NOT the full miniseries. That's right, you heard it. This DVD only goes so far and then stops. I was in shock after it came to an end, wondering where the rest of the adventure was, where the child that Robin is carrying was, and the fact that they end this DVD at ""Just the beginning"" in itself flipped my lid. So my question is, where and how can I get the rest of the series in DVD format. Will it be out soon? I sure hope so.Why they decided to release like this instead of as the VHS did with the full miniseries is beyond me. I will however stress the fact that even though this is just part of what V is all about, it is by far great. I just wish they would have released it in full.. One can only hope that they do indeed release the rest of the series, else all that is V is lost."
4,V - The Original TV Miniseries,Being a child of the '80s this brought back a lot of memories for both me and my husband. The story line holds up even after 25 years. I'd recommend this to any science fiction fan.
4,Aliens Conquer the 1980s,"Nostalgia aside, ""V"" is still surprisingly good. Set aside the dated fashions and styles. And fast-foward through the more excrutiating bits of 1980s melodrama (especially any scenes involving children and teenagers).Set aside those things and it holds up surprisingly well as a suspense story in the ""alien invasion"" sub-genera. Even the sound and visual effects are reasonably convincing (perhaps because they did not try to do more than the available technology and budget would allow)."
3,they're here,This miniseries series is pretty well done.I missed it when it came out and saw the sequel.I enjoyed this sci fi and thought it was pretty good for TV.
2,Sound Quality Poor,"The volume is set way too low on this DVD.Even when turned up for full volume it is not very loud.You must view/listen to this DVD with no ambient noise otherwise, like myself you will be rewinding to hear what you missed.Disappointing."
5,Awsome sound and video!!!,This happens to be the best mini-series ever ALMOST touched by Stephen King's IT and The Stand. I can't agree more with those who say this is what ID4 only dreamed of being! This DVD has awsome sound and video both! Amazing! And for those who are angry about it being the original series and not The Final Battle. I was talking with the person I bought this from and they said that It will be released sometime next year! :) Don't know for sure but im sure it is true :)
3,Were The Extras On This DVD Abducted?,"Where are the extra features described above? Gag reel & trailer(s) seem to be missing. The DVD back cover does not list them as included. However, video transfer is excellent, but is presented in a ""matted"" widescreen format. Again the description states ""anamorphic"". Audio is better than expected considering the age. Dialogue is a little thin, but surround effects are sharp. The behind-the-scenes documentary transfer is terrible. Commentary is interesting and audio is clear.Overall, I still recommend it. Low cost is a plus. If someone finds these extras, please write it in your review."
3,A HOLOCAUST REMINDER WITH AN UPDATED TWIST,"""V"" is a reminder of the propaganda and evils of the Holocaust that portrays visitors from outerspace as the villianess Nazis (even their emblem resembles the swaztica). They appear in human form, but soon we learn they are oversized lizards wearing body suits and are referred to as ""Visitors."" It also has the flavor of a classic western with fist fights and even the main hero, Mike Donovan, riding a white horse at one point. One of the more daring issues addressed in the movie is the conception of a baby that is a hybrid of a human female and a male ""Visitor."" Twins are born, with one dying shortly after birth, while the other baby matures at an incredible rate and ultimately prevents the destruction Earth. The mini series is entertaining and does not lack in human spirit nor patriotism -- some may even feel it is a little corny at times. ""V"" does start out a little slow, but after all of the characters have been introduced, the pace picks up."
4,"Loved ""V"" then...Still Love it Now!","As a young child, I faithfully watched the first ""V - The Original TV Miniseries, ""V - The Final Battle"" and the V weekly series on TV. I loved it then and still love it now. While some of the special effects are cheesy, (such as Diana eating the guinea pig) some of them still hold up even in 2006. That's the only reason why I gave the movie 4 stars, instead of 5. It's still fun to watch after all these years."
5,"Thank you, Warner Brothers","I waited 10 years for the VHS version to be released since my original recordings from NBC were wearing out, and I pre-ordered the DVD copy on April 10, three months in advance of the release date. If you've read this far, you know the plot already. Kenneth Johnson teaches us about our history by making it interesting: aliens instead of ..., and how easily it can happen. The plot, the acting, the special effects (for their time) and let's not forget William Hartnell's MUSIC! I haven't even seen the DVD version yet, but even if it had NOTHING more than I've already seen, I would still get it."
4,No trailer found by me,"I have been a fan since the original airing.*1 pic quality on dvd - great*2 sound - great*3 comentary - great*4 documentry (20 min+) - Great*( ) (was looking forward to the trailer(s), I found none ( if they are there i missed them!!) So no 5th *"
5,comentary is it on v the tv series,Not sort of a review but looking for detail on the v tv series. Is it the hole series in one dvd or is it juts revies. I am looking for the entire collection so I could buy it. I want all the series. thank you
3,widescreen,"I to was disappointed by the croping of this movie so it could be displayed on widescreen mode for this made for TV movie.One of the previous reviewers is an error on the fact that this movie was shot an widescreen, the 16/9 format did not exist when the movie was made.The tech group that formulated the 16/9 format was brought together by the goverment, consisting of individuals from the broadcast, computer, and the electronics industry. It did not convene until the second half of the 80's. It is very desturbing to see movies like Rear Window, from the 1950's, being altered for the 16/9 format. The change of format is being done by croping, or the second method of Anamorphic alterations."
4,Best of the 80's,"As a child of the 80's, I was priveleged to have witnessed the era of great tv miniseries. I hope to never loose the fond memories of watching V.There was such anticipation in waiting for each evening--I couldn't finish my homework fast enough. And after a nightly episode, it was all the talk at school the next day. What fun!"
5,You cannot go wrong...,"Return with us now to those thrilling days of 1983, when network event television really was special. When these episodes were originally aired, they were the only topic of discussion at work the next day.Yes, like all good science fiction, it's really about us. Marvel at the effects they were able to achieve on this budget. Speaking of budget, you can't beat this price for 186 minutes of entertainment. The transfer is beautiful. Among the clearest, truest picture quality of any of my many DVD's. Be awestruck by the huge alien ships hovering over our cities. Be mesmerized by the gorgeous but evil Jane Badler. Thrill to Marc Singer's adventures all over again. You will thoroughly enjoy yourself, and you just might learn something about what it means to be human."
2,Widescreen?,"This is a miniseries made for TV movie that aired on TV in the 1980's. The original production format is the standard ""square"" 1.33:1 ratio. And this sci-fi movie series is very good. But please tell me, because I am confused, how is a movie that that was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio get released as a widescreen ratio?This is physically impossible. And the only thing I see that they did was chop off the original top and bottom of the movie frames, and make it appear as though it is widecreen. And with this, we lose some of the original production frame. To me this is stupid. I love and only buy widesreen format films unless the original movie was filmed in the 1.33:1 ratio. And the reason for this is because I want all of the original frame that was filmed by the film maker weither it is 1.33:1 or 2.35:1, etc.To me this is definitely a deal breaker to chop off some of the original frame to make it look as though it was a widescreen. For this reason, I will not buy this film."
2,I was not impressed with the trick in advertising,"Had I known that this was not the entire ""V"" miniseries that I remembered (including the final battle), I may still have bought this DVD. However, I would have bought it, knowing what I was buying. When it ended, I could only think that I had somehow ordered the first of two in a series. I reread the case, but saw nothing stating ""the first"" or ""1 of"". I nearly tore up the cardboard case trying to see if there was another disk. It was an advertising trick to use ""Original TV Miniseries"".What there was on the DVD, was very enjoyable, a far cry better than the VHS version. If this had been the complete ""V"" series, I would have given at least 4 stars and would have gladly paid for the rest of the miniseries."
2,IT DESERVES FIVE STARS BUT......,"But after the player ends you say that's it?, what happened with the red powder and ham Tyler and the Final Battle? I hope Warner releases The Final Battle soon. Otherwise, it doesn't make sense to buy just a part of a great TV series."
3,CAREFUL !! NOT the complete series,"Wow, nostalgia ahoy !!! I grew up with this serie as the first one I actually stayed at home for with the entire family. And funnily enough it still holds up after all these years. Unfortunately it is not the complete series. I hope the rest of it will soon be released."
1,INSIPID,"Maybe if we scrape a little of it off, we'll find a 14th century underpiece... or maybe not.This is mostly uninspired mush, too cloying to even serve as background muzak."
1,Musak revisited,"If you are a fan of MO you will no doubt get a copy of this whatever any critic says about it. If not you can get it or listen to it only for its New Age type of elevator music value. Don't expect the genius music of MO of old. Apart from one or two slightly OK tracks its mostly nodding-off music. Uninspired, recycled. Sorry Mike, this is a very disappointed fan still waiting for music like that of Hergest Ridge, Amarok and all the TB's. Perhaps Mike has nodded-off too"
5,Great!!,"I'm not aware of the previous Oldfield's production, but I listened to this CD and I found it impressive...Good to relax, greats sounds... and as well good to dance...I sow same ""bad"" reviews about it... and I wonder... if his former albums are better than this one, he's a real genius!!!"
3,I wish there was some non-computer music,"I like the music on this album, but it sounds like it was created entirely on a computer...with no real instruments present. It therefore has a 'closed-in' feeling that lessened the enjoyment for me. Even a mix of acoustic and computer would have given a spark of life to this album. I therefore can't really recommend it. 3 stars only, just for the presentation, not for the music itself."
2,Not what I expected,"If you're like me and like guitars (and beer and cheese), this may not be your cup of tea. There are few stringed instruments involved in this CD. I am not a fan Balearic dance rhythms and synth pop sound.However, if you liked ""Songs of Distant Earth"", then you may enjoy this CD. My only caveat to that statement is that I liked ""Songs of Distant Earth"" as a companion to the novel of the same name by Arthur C Clarke. I think that it does not stand well on its own. ""Light and Shade"" is ""Songs of Distant Earth"" without the context provided by an explanatory novel."
2,Dissapointing...,"As a follower of Mike's works, I consider Light and Shade too extensive (it could be done in a single Cd), boring, and there's a feeling of lacking inspiration. Not bad tunes(better than Tr3s Lunas), although compared with early recordings L&S; is many steps down.He always complained of being considered a ""New Age"" composer, but the only thing he does here is to confirm he belongs to this category."
4,Another success for Mike...,"Mike oldfield is one of my favorite artists. I believe I have most all of his work. Admittedly, some of his works are better than others. Mark this one in the ""better"" category.Mike Oldfield has a certain style, unique and identifiable. After 33 some odd years, Mike's latest work proves that he has not lost his touch. And, while there are certainly a couple of albums I would not recommend to any, but the most loyal of fans, ""Light and Shade"" does NOT fall into that category. Representing a return to the ""classic Oldfield style,"" whether you are a fan or just a casual listener, this album will not disappoint.--Dan Hayman(...)"
1,End of An Era,"After reading the reviews below, I can only conclude that Mr. Kinkaid was listening to the same album I was, and everyone else something completely different. I found the whole two albums to be even more bland than Tres Lunas, and IT was elevator music with the exception of a few tracks. Understand, Mike Oldfield has delighted me for more than 35 years with awesome innovation in styles and inspired virtuosity in performance. This last album contains none of either. I, too, am sad to see the passing of a musical genius into mediocrity."
2,Worst Oldfield album...very sad,"Simply stated, this uninspired, cheap and altogether underproduced release is the last thing I'd expect from Mike Oldfield. The first CD, Light, bathes in self-parody. The only thing that it has in common with the gorgeous Songs of Distant Earth is the similar theme that pop up suddenly out of the cheap new-agey wallpaper making you think ""Have I heard this before?.. Last time I liked it."" Shade, on the other hand, is an awful attempt to stray into the trance/club territory (and a poor one!).It's a big disappointment for me. I think I'll give Mike another chance (due to his superb works in the past), but it's a very slim one, that's for sure."
1,below standard,"As a long time Oldfield fan, I must say that I'm very disappointed by this effort. I've heard all these sounds before. Tres Lunas was bad, heavily recycling sounds from the Songs of the Distant Earth, but he had that game as an excuse. But there is no excuse for this album - boring, boring, boring, non-melodic bunch sounds we heard before. I thought he can't make it worse than Earth Moving, but I was wrong - this is terrible."
3,Too Long?,"Ms. Warren stated that her audience wanted a longer/full length story from her, but I think she missed her mark with this one.Whitney and Duncan's relationship seemed forced and superficial. While Gillian and Tom's relationship was much more believable, tender and romantic.If it wasn't for Gillian and her trials and tribulations, this book would have been beyond dull."
5,Added comfort,"I love this seat cushion. I only wish it added a little more height. It is very comfortable and I'll probably order another one for the car. I've had back surgery and it helps make sitting for long periods of time more bearable. If it was a little higher, it would help even more. Most car seats (passenger side) are low and it makes sitting and getting in and out much easier."
4,comfy support,"This cushion gave new life to my 15-year-old office chair. It provides firm, comfortable support."
1,Offgassing is horrible,"I'm not sure what kind of horrible chemicals Kensington uses, but I'm pretty sure they're giving me about 10 forms of cancer. I'm planning on throwing this thing out. The chemical smell just never goes away."
2,Not as cushy as expected,"I have a lot of memory foam products: neck pillows, bed toppers, etc. so I was expecting the same type of feel from this memory foam cushion. However it was very stiff and I found it hard on my ""bony butt"". I was hoping it would ease the pain of a sciatic nerve flare, but after trying for a week, I have removed it from my chair and am SO much more comfortable with the original egg crate foam donut cushion I had been using. I am returning this."
2,"Better, but not by a lot","The memory foam seat rest is good enough that I still use it. I have an expensive chair that uses a flexible web seat that turned out to be a bit harsh on my bottom.The seat rest has improved this, but not by a lot. It is enough that I use it, which is more than I can say about anything else I have tried. It sticks to the chair, and has no drift. I hardly know it is there, which can be good and bad.I noted that the picture shows a back rest. This is not included. While there is nothing in the text to say there is a back rest, most of us depend on the picture when deciding to buy a product."
3,Way to Hard,"The seat is solid,made well,and will probably last a long time.If you weigh over 200 lbs and in good shape(small behind) this may bewhat you are looking for. For me I got a slight Cushioning effect,maybe 20%Not what I was looking for"
4,Kensington memeory foam seat,"I have only used this for about two months and only about an hour each day, but I really like the support and comfort it gives. I will be buying one for work, where I will use it a lot more."
5,seat cushion,"Makes a great difference in seating comfort, especially for long periods of time sitting at a desk or even using it in your car for long rides."
3,Ok for price,"The seat is about what you would expect for the price. It had a very strong chemical/rubber smell when I first unpackaged it. It lasted about a week. Other than that, my fanny is a bit more comfortable than it was before I got it."
3,Not much of a difference,I suppose if you have a very rigid seat then this seat rest will help. I'm 165lbs and flatten it out easily. It shouldn't be as expensive as it is.
1,Discomfort from odor outweighed any cushioning value,"I found the chemical smell drifting up from my chair to be distracting enough, that I removed the new seat rest after an hour or so, and buried it under my desk. It's now been resting there for three days.... Cushioning didn't make my back feel any better, and the odor diminished my overall comfort. This one, I'm returning."
3,So-So,"After using this for a week, I'm still not in love with it. It's a little (just a bit) too small to cover the surface of my office chair. The back is a little too thick I think. It make me sit at an odd angle."
2,Seat too hard,"After having this item on my Amazon wish list for over 2 years I was thrilled to unwrap it on Christmas morning. After trying it out, however, I was sorely disappointed. I expected to have a soft memory foam like the pad I use on my bed but instead had a seat cusion that was hard and even worse than the worn out chair I was wanting to improve !!! What made me more upset was the fact we cannot return it unless it's not what we ordered or not as described. My opinion and the description are completely different things, but it never mentioned SOFTNESS w hich is what I wanted so I guess I am stuck with it. I am resorting to re-selling it on ebay, which I know we won't get half of what we paid. Live and learn .... buy items like this from a store where you can try it out first."
1,Isn't this more than you would pay for an entire chair?,I have seen several incredibly comfortable office chairs for about $25. Who would pay this for a chair pillow?
3,My chair seat was curved and this pad made for relatively flat seat.,Pad meant for a relatively flat seat. The edges stick up on my curved seat and I had to cut the pad off tapering the edges to make it comfortable.
2,Too small,"The cushion is 16"" by 16"". That is simply too small for most adults. I am a guy with a 33"" waist (not exactly obese) and this was way too narrow to be comfortable. I had to return it."
3,Average,It was a bit small for me. I bought one at Walgreens that worked better for the same price. Would not recommend.
5,Makes work a bit more comfortable to be at :),"My tail bone sticks out, and can't sit on hard surfaces. My chair at work, is not the most comfortable, so I purchased this to give some cushion and it works just fine. It does the job, is very comfortable."
2,bummer,"after reading some good reviews, i was really looking forward to this cushion. what a let down!since i have always had trouble with my sit bones (even on leather cushy chairs) and ending up with a numb butt, thought this might solve it.out of the box it feels nice and thick and squishy but sadly flattens out after just a few minutes (i weigh 175 lbs.) it's no better than sitting on a folded blanket."
1,Seat Cushion smells moldy,At first I placed the cushion on my chair and it felt great! But after about 15 minutes I could smell this awful mold smell. Like when something is left in an unheated basement for a year. And I was not happy my pants picked up the smell too!
5,Good product...helped my aching back.,"My situation: I sit in my home office chair for many hours in a day, weigh 240 lbs, am over 50, and my office chair is older, the padding is compressed. I purchased this cushion out of desparation, as I was experiencing a difficult episode of back pain. This cushion has really helped to eliminate the back pain, and it allowed the normal back pain methods to be successful. I'll eventually get a new chair, but I bet I'll still use this pad. My wife has tried the pad, and she wants one too. I'm very happy with this purchase."
1,"It's in Japanese, NOT ENGLISH!","What a disappointment. Amazon lists the titles in english, so I was all excited, but the entire cd is injapanese. :( Guess it's garbage now, as my kids love sing the songs in english. You live you learn."
3,Satisfies the need,"The Hosa Audio Signal Selector works as designed. The case is well constructed but I have had to do some field repairs very shortly after I unpackaged the device that are disappointing. The switch selector set screw that holds the knob onto the switch shaft was overtightened at some point during construction and the result was the knob turned on the shaft rendering the unit inoperative. I had to repair this. Also the TPS female connectors that accept the TPS 1/4"" male connectors loosens on the case continually. I have not done a complete analysis, but I suspect the female connector threads are either plastic or inferior metal and are stripped resulting in not being able to be securely tightened. I need the unit and am using it daily, so I am working to repair it myself rather than send it back for replacement or repair. It is working."
1,Very poor quality control,"When the unit arrived, I unpacked it to find the selector knob simply fell off in my hand. It wasn't even attached to the body of the unit. When I tried to fix it, low and behold it's the wrong size knob for the box. The threads on the knob don't even match the threads used on the body of the unit. There's no way that this knob could ever be used with the product. The manufacturer simply threw a switch in the package that they knew would never work for the customer.At first, I thought maybe the place that sold me the unit had taken the correct knob so I ordered another from another vendor and it arrived in the same state!As consumers we have to let manufacturers and vendors know that blatant bad practices and companies that have no regard for their customers are simply not acceptable in this day and age.I will say though, that aside from the bad knob, the unit does perform well and as advertised. If you don't mind just holding on to the thin knob post, it is usable."
1,How sad it is...,"It is truly sad that people feel they need to use Amazon.com as a forum to vent their racial and religous bigotry. Throughout history, there have always been poor, angry, simple-minded, ignorant people that have felt a need to scapegoat the Jews for their pathetic lot in life. Those who gave favorable reviews to this anti-semitic piece of garbage (which REALLY is a terrible book to boot) are no different. The ""International Jew"" is a reminder both of how ignorant and disgusting human beings were, and how ignorant and disgusting some human beings can still be."
4,Good to see if you've never seen Masada,"This is like a show souvenir more than a concert film. Basically, there were two cameras set up in Tonic, and the show was recorded. OK, so Masada doesn't have the budget or following of Woodstock, but it seems relevant to note. Visually, you see Zorn, Douglas, Cohen, and Baron doing their thing on a small stage. Musically, the sound the pretty good. It's not studio-quality, but certainly acceptable for a live recording. The playing is rather inspired, and the main reason to get the DVD. The main soloists Zorn and Douglas play with fire and wit, and the audience doesn't talk over Cohen's solo (that's praise -- Scott LaFaro's solos on ""Sunday at the Village Vanguard"" got talked over)!"
2,Disappointed,"This is an exciting lost world dinosaurs story. It really seems pitched at young readers rather than adults, and not only due to its teenage hero. It is not particularly uuplifting fare for kids, however, as there are many nasty people here, many disappointments, and nothing much profound to pique a grownup's interest. The adventures are rather fantastical, yet there is nothing of ethereal fantasy in this gritty story by an author who is usually among the better SF authors.If you DO like this, note that Time Warner has once again printed a book on excreble paper. I bought the first pb issue and two years later the pages are already yellowed. Does no one save their favorite books anymore, or to read to the grandkids someday, or is TW simply contemptuous of its customers?"
1,"Formula, predictable, tired...","Definitely the weakest of all of Greg Bear's books. Not up to his usual standards of originality or depth. It'd be a good book for Jr. High kids interested in dinosaurs, and it'd make a great 'really bad B-movie'. But generally, you can feel free to skip this work."
3,Dinosaur Summer Should Go Back to School,"Since I love dinosaurs, I wanted to check this book out as soon as I heard about it. It tells the story of a boy and his father who accompany the last dinosaur circus to the Lost World, as previously discovered in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's novel of the same name, so that the remaining dinosaurs can be released into the wild. Society is no longer interested in the majesty and beauty of these creatures, and their lives in the circus is reminscent of the brutality and heartache of circus animals today. Unfortunately, the story doesn't fulfill its promise with a dragging plot, too many cardboard characters, and wasted energies. Tony Diterlizzi's artwork on the cover and within the text is the best thing about the book."
4,"Fun adventure story, captivating","A great adventure story of a boy growing to be a man, facing adverseries he never thought he'd meet in a world that has all the problems of today and DINOSAURS! Greg Bear has expanded upon a wonderful myth and given it a new life. His portrayal of a young boy being thrust into a world he is woefuly unprepared for and learning to love himself and trust others while growing into a man is a great story, add into to that beautifully evoked scenery and a lost world and it is a great book."
4,you will love this book,"Okay, yes some parts of this novel are predictable. Yes the characters are not as colorful as they could be. But this is still a great novel that really captures the sense of boyhood adventure. It is the kind of work that you finish and can't get the question out of your head: ""Why the heck have I ended up setting behind a desk for the rest of my life?"" You want to go out and become part of something grand, make yourself an adventure, discover your own metaphorical dinosaurs. And the fun part is that it does not ignore the people who gave of this gift: Doyle, O'Brien, Cooper, Harryhausen, etc. In fact, it is as much as homage to them as it is dinosaurs.I recommend this book. While it may not be quite as good as Jurassic Park (the novel), it is much better than Crichton's The Lost World. Heck, its what Crichton's sequel should have been!"
2,"Captivating premise, dragged out plot!","Greg Bears new book is a test! A test of one's patience, intelligence and SF devotion. The first half reads like a poorly written travel log and than the plot takes a very predictable turn with a less than satisfying ending. The illustrations make you feel as though you're reading a childrens book! And does anyone really care about the political ""subplot""?If you must read this book,Here is some advice: 1.Read ""book"" 1, Chapters 1-4, chapter 5: Just page 79. 2. Skip to Chapter 12 and Then read the rest of the book!"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"""This is a bit of an odd sort of book. Now, dinosaurs are of course, cool, but this is a mixture of Conan Doyle pastiche and young adult sort of novel, so it only really comes off as average, as a boy and his circus type father look to repatriate a bunch of captive dinosaurs back to the plateau that Challenger originally discovered.Things don't go smoothly, of course, to make it a bit of an adventure."
1,My Least favorite Bear Novel,"I was extremely dissapointed with this book. It lacked excitement and characters I could care about. This was a poor attempt at 50's juvenile science fiction, sorry Greg. The book came across so unrealistic that I just couldn't suspend my belief, which I am normally very good at."
2,One of Greb Bear's worst books,"This book is one of Greg Bear's worst. You could rip the pages of the first half of the book out and you would not miss a thing.There is virtually no interesting action until 3/4 of the way through the book.All through the read I kept thinking this book is nothing more than an idea for a screenplay. I think Greg didn't spend much time on it, figuring he'd get it made into a movie and he'd have to rewrite it anyway.Even the dinoaction at the end is weak. It will leave you completely unstatisfied. Especially if you like Greg's other works as much as I do.Get this book from the library if you must read it. There won't be any wait for it."
3,Chapter 18,"I've read alot of Greg Bear's books. I was enjoying this one until Chapter 18. The first page of Chapter 18 describes a character mentioned nowhere else in the book - Dr Tannenbaum. Bear describes him as ""His nose hooked sharpley and his eyes were small and close together."" This is the quintessential Nazi stereotype Jew. Why is it used here??"
2,"Unrealistic setting, wooden characters.","How many carnivorous dinosaurs can there be without a few herbivores to eat now and then? Are humans seriously the only food around? Read Jurassic Park for Dinos, and stick to Greg Bear's cyberpunk novels, which are much more enjoyable."
3,Quilting 101: A beginners guide to quilting,"This book was helpful on a limited basis, but covered too little to be of value after your first project. If you have a basic knowledge of sewing techniques, much of it is unnecessary."
5,Quilting 101,This is a great book for thoes who don't know much about sewing. A bit too simple for me yet with a few new ideas. I would recomend it to thoes who truly are beginners.
4,Great reference for the beginner.,I actually bought this a few years ago when I was starting in the exciting world of quilting. I still on occasion use it as a reference. It would be nice if they updated the photos as it appears to be very 80s.
3,Deluxtone Rockets,This is an enjoyable cd. Not as high energy as I would like but.... it has great art work!
3,A Moth at the Shore,I enjoyed reading this book. It is an easy read and is refreshing. I would recommend this book. It's a little slow at the beginning but gets better.
4,A fun read with a good story line.,Interesting and fun with some surprising developments. Would recommend this for teens and young adults.Try it you might like it as well as I did.
3,A good read but needed more of a conclusion.,"Overall it was very good. However, I was a little dissapointed with the ending. It was too quick. There wasn't enough leading up to it. The epilogue needed more detail and could have been part of the ending of the book. More detail in the end."
3,Good book to read in segments,"I gave this offering 3 stars because it was an acceptable read but in the later 3rd of the book, began to drag a bit."
5,A Month at the Shore,"Spellbinding, Heart warming book with just enough suspense for great entertainment! I'll look forward to reading more from this author.This is my first off many to come from ANtoinette!"
5,Great Read!!!,"Great romance and mystery combined. I will definitely buy more of this author's books. Very enjoyable and well written , I was very pleased with this purchase."
4,A pleasant diversion,"The characters were likeable and the setting beautiful. Some parts of the story seemed underdeveloped and implausible. But willing to overlook those things, it was a pleasant read and worth the time, with a happy ending thrown in."
4,"Good, but not what I expected","The ""snippet"" is about how these two originally met, and how Ken was her knight in shining armor. That was probably the least talked about part of this book.I was expecting a big romance, but no. the book was mainly a mystery, and about family.Don't get me wrong. Good book, I enjoyed it, but the first 10 chapters were slow, because I kept waiting for the story I thought was going to be told."
3,A Fun Read,Kind of a fun read with some unusual twists. Stockenberrg leads you on and then suddenly you realize who really was responsible.
2,No character development,"I thought the basic premise was good but the characters lacked depth. I disliked both the hero and heroine in this book. They were so whiny, self-absorbed and just plain annoying. The heroine especially was exasperating because she kept going on and on about her family history. I kept thinking ""get over it already""!There was a character that was sort of central to the plot that we never really knew much about except the basics, so I couldn't understand the reason why everyone was so into her. The only thing I didn't see coming was the twist at the end.I don't recommend this book."
3,It took a while,"I don't really have too much to say about this story except that it took a long while to get to the point. It was a good story, I will give the author that, but I felt that the important elements of the story were thrown together real quick at the end as if the author was running out of space. There was just too much time spent on yard work for several chapters that could have been altogether eliminated to give the author more chance to develop Laura's relationship and/or suspense. I'm trying not to give away the plot too much, but this story had the potential of being way better. I reread almost every book I get a hold of at some point or another, but I won't be coming back to this one.And I don't know if it is just me but Corinne drove me insane with her naivety. I totally get thinking the best of others, especially those whom you are close too, but her inability to be a fully grown mature adult was obnoxious."
3,Predictable,This quick read was a predictable romance/mystery. The main characters were likable if somewhat forced in their actions. The mystery was not at all hard to solve but fit in the story. Overall it was a good read with just enough romantic/sexual tension.
3,light reading,"Good beach read. Not bad, just don't expect a brain teaser with this one! Relax and have a glass of wine.."
3,One month at the shore,Very good book. Enjoyed very much. Twist at the end was not expected. Was very surprised. I will read more of this author's books.one month at the shore was a good read
2,Alright,"I really didn't enjoy this book that much... I never grew to like the characters. I know this is supposed to be a stupid romance novel, but the plot was overly contrived, the characters all spoke very similarly/had the same personality, and I didn't identify with them. The writing was not bad, and the book was generally ok, but I can't really enjoy a book if I don't enjoy its characters and can predict the entire plot from the first chapter."
5,A Month at the Shore,"This book was so good, I couldn't put it down. The family didn't realize how much they could give to the community."
4,Nice mix,"It was a story with a nice mix of romance and suspense. Easy reading, perfect reading for a relaxing holiday."
3,kindle book,"so so. It was an easy enjoyable read---one that I'll probably read next time we're on a beach vacation! Sitting in the sunshine, hearing the ocean in the background---I'll probably enjoy it more."
3,Predictable,"This story was ok, but predictable.Not enough depth for me. This author did a good job of giving the reader a good description of events."
4,Easy reading,"Love, family, suspens... a bit of all these gives a nice book, easy to read, relaxing but still quite interesting!"
3,Fun story,"Fun, adult contemporary romance. I enjoyed each of the characters in this book. I wasn't in love with the old lady storyline but the rest of the book overshadowed that small part. I am always glad to read about strong female characters which this book has. It was a freebie and I was pleasantly pleased with this book!"
4,Exceptional Read,"A fascinating read about family relationships, love, and murder.Bringing it all together nicely for a terrific and unexpected ending."
4,very enjoyable,"Totally enjoyed this book. The characters are believable and I found myself being there. Very good and I would recormmend it to anyone. In fact, told my daughter to download to her Kindle. I will read more of her novels."
3,A month at the shore,"Seemed like a good ""summer read"". Cute love story mystery. Learned alot about a garden center and enjoyed the setting."
3,Not bad...,This was a good mix of mystery and romance. Snack was my favourite character. I like the fact it wasn't laced with profanity. Good read.
3,Well...,"A decent read, but not much substance. I hadn't read a romance in years. It was predictable in story, and stilted in language at times."
3,Perfect for a lazy sunday,"This book was OK. Quite Sunday kinda lazy day read. I was disapointed by the ending, but everthing else was just what I expected in this kinda book."
2,Ho Hum,It was just ok. I actually had to put it down once for a while and pick it up again to finish reading but I'm glad that I did finally finish it.
5,Unsuspecting story line from title.,Thoroughly enjoyed this book; liked the author's writing style; expect to read more of Antoinette Stockenberg's books in the future.
3,Kinda boring,"With all the great reviews I really expected more suspense more drama, more everything. Technically there was nothing wrong. The writing style flowed easily and the characters were described great. There was just something missing. Not enough twists in my opinion. I caught myself drifting off more than once reading this book. Other readers may disagree but I just need more."
4,A month at the shore,A month at the shore. A quick moving story showing persistence pays off. The main characters kept your attention during the whole book.
3,Good,Good book for easy reading and getting immersed in another world for awhile. Interesting characters and nice twist to theplot.
4,Fairytale ending,This book was so good! I read it every chance I could get! I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read about a fairytale ending!
5,Interesting story!,I really enjoyed reading this book. Allof the little twists and turns kept me reading right to then end and wanting more!
4,A Month at the Shore,"good book, but it was a little slow to begin with for me..it was great once you get to the middle :) Kept you guessing"
3,very predictable,The ending was abrupt and the story was predictable. My book club was not impressed. I don't think this author will be on our reading list again.
5,Excellent,"Really good book. Enjoyed the characters and the story line. Will be reading more of this series of books. Loved the set to in Cape cod, have family that lives there so I can relate to the area."
4,I want a Month at the Shore,"Very well written. t ONE point, I could almost feel the sea breeze and smell the salty air. THANK you for a few days at the Shore."
4,excellent storyline!,"This was a really good book,I enjoyed the history, and the mystery of it! It was very well written and I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good urder mystery with history and a feeling of you actually being there on the shore with the characters!"
5,page turner,Interesting characters. Loved the romance but was surprised pleasantly to find myself caught in the family relationships and rooting for the Shore kids to come back together and out on top.
4,Very good read!,"I really enjoyed this book. At first it was hard to get into... but I kept at it and am glad I did! And that is the only reason I gave this 4 star.I greatly enjoyed the characters. They were well developed. And very real! I appreciate that in a good book. Ken and Laura have an embracing relationship that keeps you rooting for them all the while keeping the other characters in mind thinking.."" what about Corinne? And snack?"" And the author did an amazing job of including them in. And the ending was great. Which is always important! A great summer read.. well it's winter here in Illinois so that makes it a great read anytime! Tho will leave u with spring fever ;)"
1,NOT a beach towel!!!,"I returned this item unopened but it was very obvious from the package (clear wrap bag) that this was a VERY thin, light weight towel. Bath towel yes, but not for beach or pool, in my opinion. The dimensions might be the right size but it was too thin."
1,Very cheaply constructed,The review prior to mine was indeed CORRECT. It is NOT a beach towel. Wanted to give this as a gift. NO WAY. It is thinner than my kitchen hand towels. I sent it back and ordered one that was 100% cotton. I am hoping that one will what you'd expect a beach towel should be.
2,Disappointing,"After reading many books about French Provence. I tried to find books about other parts of France so I bought this book. However, Ms. Bailey's limited French resulted in her life in the French Pyrenees mostly among the expat. To the end of the book, I still did not feel or learn something much about the French Pyrenees. Might be good for reader who like the story of the ancient monk, but not me."
5,"Wolves like you've never f**king seen them before! S***, this book f**king rocks!","Yup, wolves are my favorite canine of all time and not only do they rock and I love them, they are topped ONLY by hyenas and the 8 big cats. On to this book being filled with lots of interesting and worthwhile information, not to mention beautiful photographs of wolves playing, fighting, eating, howling, giving birth, showing compassion, snarling, being cool, being cute and taking a dive in the water or a hunt in the snow. This beautiful ode to the world's coolest and most beautiful canine is among the best books I've ever read and it has all the things mentioned above and a whole lot more, including a history of how all wolves mattered in the past and how they matter now. If you like wolves or any sort of nature, you need to get this book without stall. Oh yeah, there's even a cute yet suspicious picture of wolves sharing food with a puma(one of the 8 big cats)!"
4,The Complete set..for the FIRST TIME!!,"This set contains,in short, the complete M-G-M albums,singles, and pre-M-G-M material(as just sam the sham). some of this material sounds a bit muddy(""Red Hot"",in example.) Others sound scratched up(like the aforementioned early stuff). otherwise, i'ts pretty much a decent sounding set otherwise. if you NEED,WANT,JUST GOT TO HAVE THIS SET,this is DEFINETLY FOR YOU!!!"
5,"A Diamond in the ""Rough""","Have never swung a club in my life, but can't get enough of Troon MacAllister's golf novels. Like all great literature, the setting is less important than the other elements: character, plot, pace and humor. Scratch is right up there with the best of them, and I for one believe it's the equal of The Green, which is saying a lot. Even both my teenage kids ate it up, and all they read is CD liner notes. Am recommending it to everybody I know."
5,Everyone wants to be a little like Eddie,"I picked this book up on sale at a bookstore, pretty much blindly. What a fabulous read! Eddie Caminetti is flawless! You know you wish you were a little more like him: smooth, calculated, really smart, honest and quite successful to boot - but never boring. The whole book is engaging and I've never set foot on a golf course. It's funny and insightful and makes (intelligent) light of something that people tend to take very seriously - golf equipment. I recommend it to anyone!"
3,"It Ain't The Arrow, It's The Indian","Another enjoyable Eddie Camminetti read, but not as much fun as ""The Green"" or ""The Foursome."" As always, Troon McAllister has an interesting take on the game, and in this case, equipment manufacturers."
4,The REAL sound of Swinging London,"Club-goers favourites Zoot Money's Big Roll Band recorded as they were meant to be heard - live and in person. Recorded in early 1966, shortly before the recording session that produced their second UK LP ZOOT! and their debut US LP, this one is a knock-out. It shows the group running the gamut of their band-book; Hammond organ driven soul-jazz, slow blues, and energetic R&B and Soul work-outs. The musicianship is quite notable, especially the sax section, and both Zoot and Paul Williams turn in great vocal performances. All this PLUS a guest appearance by the sensation (but under-rated, if not virtually unknown) Herbie Goins! Recorded at Dick Jordan's Klook's Kleek club in North London, this one is a sweat-soaked, wear-out-your-loafers must."
4,ANDY SUMMERS's First Band...,"That really short guy pictured on the CD is the young Andy Somers, later to be famous as Andy Summers, guitarist for The Police. You'd never know it from listening to this lively R&B show-band, but three of these guys-- Andy, Zoot and the bass player-- were soon to form the legendary psychedelic group Dantalion's Chariot who played at the Middle Earth and UFO clubs with early Pink Floyd and early Soft Machine. Zoot and Andy tended to stick together, as they later played together in Eric Burdon's psychedlic Animals, in the Kevin Coyne band, and in ex-Soft Machine founder Kevin Ayer's band."
4,Totally underrated,"Sure RH wishes these songs would disappear - he's written so much else that blows most of this CD out of the water - but come on; The Cars She Used To Drive, Young People Scream, It Was The Night, How Do You Work This Thing, and 52 Stations are essential in any version. Okay, the ""special disco"" version of Nightride isn't so special after all, but under the right conditions, it's a nerdy weirdo rump-shaker - as is Midnight Fish. Out of place for RH? There's no such thing."
3,Not bad considering it's Robyn's worst,"The production of Groovy Decay is totally unsuited to Robyn. And it doesn't help that the songs are generally sub-par. Even so, the demo versions aren't bad, and there are a few top-notch tunes here (""52 Stations,"" ""St. Petersberg,""America""). For die-hard Hitchcock fans it's worth having. Otherwise, avoid."
3,It's okay...,"The towel is just a typical beach towel. It is not really large, and it is pretty thin. It is the same size of the beach towels of yester-year. If you like the newer, plush, large beach towels, then this is not for you. It is soft, but I don't know that it will remain soft after washing. As far as the design, it is vibrant and just what we were looking for."
1,10.4 inch tablet,It was not a tablet!!!!!! it was simply a monitor screen. i had to return it and order from price angels.com
3,"Does Its Job, BUT....","I use a digital recorder casually (mostly in my car when I think of something I need to do, or for making lists), and for this purpose the unit works as it should. However, I did sell it as you have to go thru several steps to access the various folders, which is very very awkward and cumbersome. I do like the record-plus feature, however, which allows you to add something to an existing file (at the end) without starting a new file...a feature usually found only in much more pricey units."
5,One of my favorite novels,"I wish this guy would write another novel. Kill Your Darlings is an absolute gem -- funny, twisted, and clever as hell. It's told from the point of view of a washed-up, one-hit-wonder writer, who now teaches at a community college and has been working interminably on a trivia book about other writers. Each turn of the page provides a hilarious, outrageous surprise. Our hero is pretentious, pedantic, preening, vain, and resentful (especially of Martin Amis, who he views as a peer, but who ""affected to not remember"" our hero! at a conference). To say more about this book I'd have to give away some of the delightful plot turns. Trust me, this book is a twisted riot."
3,No one reads the three star reviews,"A novel I enjoyed for the bit about literary groupies, the female literary agent who swears a lot, and the fact that the main character can't bring himself to mention the novels of Martin Amis by name. Also for its readability. Minus marks for being a thriller with no tension, unconvincing plot developments, clichéd characters (moody teenage son, low-life gangster), poor dialogue, and a bland prose style: I could've done without the constant use of the word `swagger' in relation to Mart's prose, and fellatio prissily described with the phrase `I took him in my mouth'. Why not just say you sucked his ****? Also, the copy I had was very poorly proofread. Seems like your publishers don't earn their money, Terence. Terence Blacker has a great name by the way. Gregory Keays is also a good name for a character (unlike his agent, Fay Duckworth, who has a crap name). Terence and Gregory are the names of the characters in Martin's novel about failure."
2,Boring!,"I agree with several of the comments below. I noted several times in the book where the authors would repeat the same date (in slightly different words) over and over again. At least they might cause people to say ""hey, I can come up with better dates than what is in this book."" I've found a good source for fun dates to be The RoMANtic's Guide and Creative Dating. You will get your money's worth with those. This book is a waste of your money."
1,I would give it no stars if I could.,I bought this book looking for fun things to do on a date. I seriously doubt the author did even 1/5th of the things in there. It was stupid.
1,Don't waste your money,"This is a truely stupid book. Most of the ideas are simple common sense. If you can't think of them on your own, you are a really lousy date. There are not 2002 ideas. Most of the ideas are repedative--listen to rock music, listen to blues music, listen to country music. Great! What do you do with the next two hours? Most of the ""ideas"" aren't even long enough to make a date out of. Washing your dog only takes ten minute, and really isn't much of a date. The book is terrible and I can't believe anyone wrote it much less said, ""this is great. Let's publish it."""
1,What a waste of time. Full of redundancy and bad taste.,"Despite the fact I rarely EVER give 1 star ratings on books, I feel like this book deserves every bit of such a pitiful rating. 2002 Things to Do on a Date is FILLED with repetitiveness and redundancy. I'd say there is only about 100 or less things to do. To give an example. Two ideas are ""Go hiking on cliffs."" and a little later there is something like ""Go on an hike together."" The ideas are pitiful and can be HIGHLY inappropriate for dates. I've been on many incredible dates and feel that if I took my dates on the ideas within this book I'd quickly loose any potential for a 2nd date. Perhaps 3 or 4 ideas are good ideas, the rest is trash...absolute, definite trash."
2,In Agreement,"I would definitely agree with those who wrote that this book appeared to be put together after an all-night brainstorming session. I wouldn't consider ""pray together"" to be a date.I think for a date you should read this book with your date and laugh at most of the stupid ideas.If you are looking for creative and fun date ideas I'd highly recommend going to 300creativedates. com and check out the material there. I loved the ideas."
1,HaHaHaHa!!!! David Cross I love you!!!!!!!!,"so i bought this after watching David ""Mr.Show"" Cross' comedy special on hbo, and his rant that made fun of this insepid book. ""so yeah, i picked up this book 2002 things to do on a date. its for people, you know, who don't know how to date. because sometimes you forget to open your eyes, dress yourself, or speak english"".so how bad is it? you should get it and judge for youself. such things as ""pray together"". that's a great ice breaker on a first date. ""watch mtv and play along with a kazoo"", or ""have a picnic under the stars and watch for halley's comet"". because after all, it only comes around every 76 years.yeah so this book was made for the socially inept and boring. don't take it seriously at all. i'd be amazed if people actually did."
2,Oh please...,"A few good ideas that would be obvious to most people with a pulse. I think if it would have so much better if the author had focused on 202 really interesting things to do on dates. Instead it's just a list of things that anyone could do, on a date or not. (Frankly, some of these ideas should not be trotted out early in the dating cycle... ""talk about what you think about death...???"") This isn't a book - it's the result of a brainstorm session without an editor.If you want to break out of a rut, I'd suggest picking up a local alternative weekly or newspaper's Friday section and cruising through the stuff to do section. Or peruse the list of classes to a nearby Learning Annex or community college or even thumbing through the yellow pages under 'instruction,' 'restaurants' and so on, you'll find enough ideas to get you going.If my husband and I ever get to the point that we have to refer to this book, it's probably time for marital counseling."
5,What a great romp -- lots of fun ideas!,"I bought this book ""a couple of relationships ago"" and unearthed it recently. My guy and I are having more fun going through the book, seeing what we've already done, and getting ideas for future dates (e.g., he's going to teach me how to fence ...). The ideas range from the free-of-charge to the grandiose, so there's something for everyone. We have recommended this little volume to numerous friends."
3,Hunter by Diana Palmer,it was an older book and but I wanted to read it as the characters were mentioned in another book I had.
3,overrated,"A few songs in this set are ok. Many, however, are either mediocre, blah, or bad. A few are rap songs, and a few are retakes on old hits. I was fooled by the high rating given by the other reviewers. Ciao, amigos."
5,Excellent Album with Classic Songs by Accordion Greats,"A must have collection for accordion afficionados everywhere. Jo Ann Castle's ""Bumble Boogie"" stands out in the how does she do that file. My other favorites were Dick Contino's ""Lady of Spain"" (no accordion album would be complete without this song) and Martin DeLugg's ""So What's New"", a martini lounge favorite. I would like to have seen ""Tico Tico"" on the album and no Weird Al stuff, but will have to wait till next time."
3,Enjoyable,"Our local library had this CD. It was great hearing some of the great performers again. Dick Contino is great as well as Joe Anne Castle. Those Darn Accordions rendition of The Perry Mason Theme was interesting.I did not care for the Weird Al number. Also I wish that the had picked one of Art Van Damme's better selections.I wish that they had also picked one of Frankie Yankovic's better known pieces such as Just Because or Blue Skirt Waltz.Over all though, I really enjoyed it. I am thinking about purchasing it shortly."
1,Mediocre.,A few of the tracks are OK. Most sound like recordings made from old records. I wouldn't have bought it had I heard it first.
2,HA!,"Thurman, eh?I saw these guys in London supporting These Animal Men. Rumour had it that they had been a grunge act a year earlier, and (post-blur) bought themselves Ben Shermans and lept wholeheartedly on the bandwagon.The accents are appalling, mock-ney nonsense, the lyrics are cliche ridden drivel, and the riffs have all been nicked.That said, they are endearingly bad, hence the 2 stars. But take it from me, you'd have to be from another country to find them even remotely credible."
4,Being cool in the pool!,"Ok, so my mom bought these for me for my 13th birthday and I love them! Now when I'm in my grandparent's pool I can swim faster than my cousins! I'm really happy that my mom bought these for me because I have already had so much fun with them so far this summer. I can't imagine my summer without them. I only wish they had more colors in these so my sisters can have them too and that way we don't mix them up cause these are mine!"
1,Coleman pmp3000,These are guaranteed to bring you grief. Their failure rate is nearly 100% in my experience. Save yourself the pain and find an alternative.
5,Gundam Wing Forever,"Being something of an anime fan, I have a relatively large collection of imported compact discs. Gundam Wing Operation three is my absolute favorite (rivaled only by the soundtrack for Maken X). My only genuine complaint about the album is that it does not contain the series main title theme, and only a ""TV-size"" version of ""Rhythm Emotion"" (as presented in the episode preceeding ""Trowa's Return to the Battlefield) I was really hoping it would be the version that is presented in ""Sanck Kingdom Destroyed"", complete with the trippy vocoder vocals in the beginning. But in spite of that, this is still one of the most fabulous collections of classical/pop/techno hybrid music ever created."
4,Gundam Wing Operation v.3!,"A cool CD for any Gundam fan!Songs are all sung in beautiful Japanese by your favorite Gundam Wing characters, and others. CD includes song lyric booklet including pictures, but you might have some trouble with the words, because it's all in Japanese kana!This CD is really an intresting, functional, perfect piece to add to any Gundam Wing fan's collection!"
4,A great CD!,This CD's image songs are really cool! I even like Relena's. SCARY!! Lady Une's song is great! All of the songs are great actually! Now on to the BMG's! All the BMG's are really beautiful. The slow songs just make you feel really calm and peaceful. The upbeat songs on which they play during battle scenes is really powerful music. It's all played with emotion.
3,Still making errors!,I've been waiting for the 9th edition to come out because of the errors I found in the 8th edition. I've been a user of the Access guides for more than ten years and I have always found them very useful. However when I bought the 8th edition I had to call the publisher because there were many mistakes in the guide map numbering. They thanked me and said they would notifiy me when the next edition came out (naturally they didn't). I was very distressed from the first review on Amazon of the 9th edition. It appears that they don't really have anyone that checks for accuracy. I guess I'll wait for the 10th edition.
4,Do more than shop & eat in L.A.,"This book is phenomenal for architecture, museums, parks, galleries and other interesting sites. The maps help us in using large L.A. map to keep us oriented. Have found some great places to shop by just checking the area around our destinations, like the outdoor mall area of Santa Monica. Have made L.A. trips using the older version and love it."
3,yummy,"these are very good quality chocolates, they are a little dull, meaning ting a litt.le stale[?] but bthey still taste great. At 50% off, a good deal"
5,"nostalgic, hilarious and actually useful","These are extremely crisp and clean sounds and immediately recognizabel as being from Hanna-Barbera. Some of the really short sound effects are perftect for digitizing into effects sounds for either Windows or Macintosh theme sounds or to add into a fun flash movie you're creating. The possibilities are endless when used sparingly and in the right places. This is not a CD that you just pop in your stereo and listen to beginning to end... you can do it once, but that's about it! But it's a fabulous resource for impressing a visual with a sound. If you're mixing flash movies, creating Director presentations or just making Windows/Mac themes, I highly recommend this disc for the high quality. Note that the CD is marked ""NOT FOR COMMERCIAL USE, "" so you can't be using these sounds for profit, but you can for artistic expression. :-)"
3,Half & half,"Whereas the actual sound effects quality is great, and there are more than plenty enough here to use & enjoy, they should have spared us with the character voices, which are not original, nor in my opinion sound like the characters.I have seen a 11 LP library on eBay of Hanna Barbera effects...now THAT would be useful!"
4,My son read it the day before he played Pebble -- and loved it!,"I gave this to my son to read before he played Pebble Beach a couple of weeks ago. While playing, the caddies talked to him about stories of the famous and infamous reported in the book. It made the experience even more fabulous. He gave the book -- and the Pebble experience -- rave reviews."
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"This is basically a series of essays, not the scholarly work that delineates the process the author went through to reach his conclusions. It's also concentrated mainly on errors made in the actual conduct of the war. Does include a well stated argument for why the author concludes the war was fought over slavery. On the other hand, it includes an inadequately-researched section on why African-American slaves fought for the Confederacy but ignores all the slaves who ran away from their masters and sought refuge with and eventually fought in the Union army."
1,The only reason it gets 1 * is because it was written.,"THE SOUTH WAS NOT FIGHTING FOR THE CONTINUATION OF SLAVERY. THAT'S ABOUT ONE OF THE WORST LIES I'VE EVER HEARD. THE ONLY THINGS THAT TOP IT ARE THAT LINCOLN THOUGHT SLAVES WERE OF EQUAL STATUS TO FREEDMEN, (HE WANTED TO SHIP THEM OFF TO LIBERIA)AND THAT BILL CLINTON DIDN'T SLEEP WITH MONICA. THE WAR WAS ABOUT A DIFFERENCE IN ECONOMIC AND GOVERNMENT WAYS."
4,Insight into the past,"The book is full of fascinating detail, though at times it reads like a doctoral dissertation.Wish it had gone beyond 1881."
3,Enough for the money I paid,"I know golf links, for a long time, but always used old fashioned clubs, used and borrowed (junk). This is my first new golf set. Im happy with it, the stand bag is so cool, I use it with a cart, with no problem. The irons dont come on graphite but my swing is getting better. The worst is the tittle : ""... by Dunlop..."" and I cant see the Dunlop brand in the bag, or any club. Despite of this, it is complete and Im sure I will improve my game."
4,"Haunting, Scary, Funny, Beautiful","Robyn Hitchcock saved me from oblivion in the early 1980s, shortly after David Bowie had sold out to stadium pop. What can you say about an artist who is like a cross between Bob Dylan and The Gormenghast Trilogy? The first thing that stands out in any Hitchcock excursion is the quirky sense of humor, best seen here in the hilarious Freudian barbershop ""Uncorrected Personality Traits."" But the underside of a dark sense of humor is just plain dark: ""Sometimes I Wish I Was a Pretty Girl"" and ""Sounds Great When You're Dead"" have an edge and desperation so intense and authentic as to border on the frightening. But there is sweetness and sadness here as well, as in ""Autumn Is Your Last Chance"" and the instrumentals that bookend the album. This is one of finest pieces of solo work by an utterly unique artist."
3,Not as satisfying,"Of the Hitchcock fans here, I find myself in the minority; I really feel this is one of his weaker offerings. He is in great voice, and the acoustic setting gives a haunting, ethereal quality to the work, especially on ""Cathedral."" So what's my problem?It's tough to put my finger on it...I find a few too many throwaways: ""Uncorrected Personality Traits"" with its barbershop reading of psychoanalysis, ""Ye Sleeping Knights of Jesus,"" that smacks of The Stones ""Girl with Faraway Eyes,"" (musically, not lyrically)and the Gumby (Monty Python version)""Mellow Together,""and some weirdness that lacks Hitchcock's usual sense of whimsy. (""Furry Green Atom Bowl,"" ""Sometimes I Wish I was a Girl"")There are moments of wonder here like the aforementioned ""Cathedral,"" the haunting instrumentals and the title track that still gives me chills, but I don't feel the balance here that I have found on many of his other cd's."
1,how do I return the ring?,I was sent the wrong size ring and cannot fit it on my finger....I lost the return info. So I have not worn the ring.
2,OK for beginners,"This book does well as an intro for people who know little about the tradition out of which Mariology emerged. If Mr Hahn wanted to share his scholarly insights with readers, however, the book (at least this edition) has little reference material...He tried to put his footnotes in the back of the book, but oddly enough, they correspond to no numbers in the actual text. Likewise, the few references he does cite have no corresponding numbers in the back of the book, (for example, he is missing numbers 45-51 and numbers 68-79 in his notes).It is one of the most mysterious ""citation of references"" I have ever read. He would have done better to just drop the source material altogether, and just presume we believe that all of his citations are correct, as so many other pastoral books do...For those who want a deeper read, it fails pretty badly."
1,"Great potential, but that is about it......","I felt that this book had great potential to try to explain the Catholic dogmas about Mary, because I have heard great things about Scott Hahn. Well this book failed to explain to me the Marian dogmas of the Church. I do have a better understandind of some of the dogmas, however, it has actually lessened my faith in the dogmas of Mary."
1,Eisegesis extreme,"It is truly remarkable the depths that Catholic apologists will stoop to to idolise the blessed mother of Jesus. Hahn resorts to intriguing eisegesis to betray any slither of evidence from the Bible to support his blatantly erroneous thesis. The ability of Roman Catholics to treat the Word of God with utter contempt by contorting the true and blatantly obvious meaning of Biblical passages to support their medieval error is beyond common sense and respectability. To read a brief yet true account of who Mary was (is it not the truth that is important) then read Doctor James White's ""Mary, Another Redeemer?"" This one by Hahn should be treated as wild speculative fiction."
4,Worthwhile reading,"This book apparently is the only guide book you can buy for the Sierra National Forest. Believe it or not, things haven't changed much since the book was written in 1968, except that logging has stopped in most areas. The book contains a lot of background information about the history of the area and is an interesting an easy read. You can't really plan a vacation based on this book, but it's informative nonetheless."
1,The bad thing from Sony,"I bought it in WalMart and returned it . I wonder, why there is no switcher ON/OFF? Also, eight hours are enough for records with very low quality. For good quality there are only 1hour 30 minutes. In the end, you can not put you information somewhere else (computer or other tape recorder)."
1,What was Sony thinking?,"I have to wonder... I mean, who creates anelectronic device these days that just staysON. *All the time*. :-O It's just nutty...Don't buy this recorder -- big waste of money."
4,Does What It's Supposed to,"I use this to record lectures. It records. It plays it back. The sound isn't the greatest when listening to what was said, but if you put on headphones, that helps A LOT. If you want something small and digital that records with no bells and whistles, this is it."
1,Buggy,"I purchased one of these and really liked it at first. It has a good design and the right features at a good price. Unfortunately it went to market untested. After you record 10 or so messages the middle of some messages drops out. If you are recording a phone number, when you play it back it sounds fine, then you record some more notes and get back to the office and play it again and you get ""call mary 555(blip) 1""The middle of the recording is gone! I thought I had a bad unit so I returned it and swapped for another unit. I was excited because I really like the way the erase button worked but, the next day when I had 30 messages recorded, again the middle dropped out. This occurs on 5 out of 40 messages which is way too much. This is a big headache since I have lost numbers because of this thing. Dont buy it!"
1,"Works, but disappointed","Received in good condition for a refurb. Unit itself was much smaller than I thought. Records and plays good, but FF and REW buttons are difficult to use. It is ALMOST a really good product."
3,No Power Off!,"I liked this device until I discovered there is no power off feature other than removing a battery. The device is constantly ""on."""
1,Textbook at the school for losers,"I saw this book in a bookstore recently and had to write a review. Thumbing through it left me with that same feeling I had the day after the recent presidential election - you know, sick to one's stomach. Ok, it's not just that the premise for the book is idiotic (really if you can't figure out online dating, then you probably need to keep your DNA out of the gene pool), but really, this book is such a waste of paper that I am suprised Sierra Club hasn't protested it. The writing is puerile and the attempts at humor akin to the jokes my preschool children tell. What were the ""Learn...for 5 Bucks"" people thinking? Save your money and spend the night tweezing your eyebrows, it'll be less painful and is more likely to improve your chances in the dating world."
1,See the author's online personal ad for 5 bucks,"Not getting a lot of hits to your online personals ad, Ms. Wodtke? The final page cleverly named ""About the Author"", uncovers the book's real purpose: another way for the author to get her own online personals ad seen. Other than that, most of what's here is obvious, common-sense stuff, that you should be aware of if not before you even venture into online dating then certainly by the time you're in the registration process of any personals site. Most tell you extensively how to navigate their services, which includes information that is in this book. The upside here is that you don't pay more than $5. Yet another downside is being foolish enough (I'm putting myself in this category) to actually pay for it at all."
3,A bit of a mix,"The idea itself and all is interesting, and I liked the flashbacks to the training of the guard. However, I'm not to fond of the writing at some point, especially for Mirith Sinn. Kir Kanos is an interesting character, but at some point you have to wonder if he's on the line of hypocrisy. Indeed, his overall philosphy is remniscent of Baron Fel's in 'In the Empire's Service'. (very, very reccomended work, by the way)The art has a nice cinematic style to it, but at the same time it seems to lack a bit of cohesiveness. Effects like the ones for planets are odd but alright, but, alas the ships and cityscapes are poorly drawn.Read 'Crimson Empire' for the action and information on the Imperial Guard. If you want keen Imperials and a wide array of well-developed characters, look elsewhere, like the X-wing Rogue Squadron series."
4,A very good story . . . if you like the Crimson Guard,"While this story was not a complete loss, both the story line and the art were unremarkable. The story was definitely not a major event in the Star Wars universe, and it will probably not be one of the talked about story lines in the years to come. Overall it is just below average for a Star Wars tale. ALTHOUGH, if you are a fan of the Crimson Guard, this book is very enjoyable, and worth the money. The reader gets to see inside their training, and learns of their fate after the Dark Empire story line. Add to that several great action sequences of the Guard, and you have a great story for any lover of the Crimson Guard. (I am a fan of the Crimson Guard, hence the 4 stars.)"
3,Not up to expectations,"Crimson Empire had a lot of potential but Dark Horse failed to exploit it to the max. The idea of an Imperial Super-Hero that remains Imperial no matter what is very interesting, that this character was a member of the elite Imperial Guard is even more so, but beyond that, the story was hollow, the characters were not explored in depth and the art was not among the best for Star Wars Comics. Cover Art is Amazing (in this TPB you get a Cover Art Gallery for all 6 issues at the end of the book). Yes, the online issue #0 was adapted and included in this book, not at the very beginningm but a few pages into the story."
4,Nice and long,"A good, long graphic novel. I say this because I'm tired of those 92 page TPB's that I finish in an hour. Crimson Empire has a great storyline, art, and dialogue. However, the characters seemed a little too steriotypical (the rebel commander looks just like Mara Jade) and boring. Kir Kanos is your standard ex-soldier who's only out for himself. Carnor Jax is also a standard villain who laughs evily, kills people, and breaks things. Still, the rest of the storyline saves this as does the art (incredible). A good one."
3,TOO MUCH VIOLENCE,"This is a good illustrated novel, I as an adult enjoyed it very much. But if you are thinking about giving it to your kid or teenager I wouldn't recommend it. It has too much graphic violence ."
3,Where is this going?,"How oh how can this book be summarized? Unnecessary and irrelevant and non contributing to the STAR WARS universe are some. I can't believe the baseless story telling and the mediocre artwork of this truely great potential. Not only did I think this book to be underdone, but the writers and editors really dropped the ball on this one. Great potential, but what great disappointment on reading it. How can they justify the many gaps and uncharacteristic characterization of the story? How can they explain the quick and clicheish solutions??"
5,One of the best starwars comics,Starwars Crimson Empire is prehaps one of the best starwars comics darkhorse has created . It had a really great storyline Amazing action and some nice artwork too. Another reason Starwars CE is so memorable is because IT's characters are truly unique . Kir Kanos is probably one of starwar's most complex and mysterious characters and never have I seen a villan as fascinating or as diabolical as Carnor Jax . In conclusion Starwars Crimson Empire Is MUST_READ!
5,Amazing Live dvd,"this dvd was great! for me who hasnt gotten a chance yet to see tech live yet, cause i live in norway. i just loved the dvd, the inside look behind stage. and oh my oh my the perfomances wasoff the chain.this is like a lecture how a true performance is done,anyway, the dvd was amazing, if want to see something new and unique, this dvd is for you! go get it!!"
2,Lazos de Amor,I was so excited to see this on dvd but it was edited so poorly.I could barely understand what was going on ...I would not recommend anyone to buy on dvd.
3,LAZOS DE AMOR,I USED TO LOVE THIS STORY AND WAS SO EXCITED WHEN I SAW IT ON HERE. BUT TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT WHEN I WATCHED IT I WAS HEART BROKEN WITH THE EDITING. THEY TOOK SO MUCH OF THE STORY LINE OUT IT WAS CONFUSING. SO SAD.
3,Lazos de Amor,"This very short version(too short) was not the best, to many parts where you cannot figure out the thread of the story. I am sure the original complete one must have been good, but this one was simply incomplete as far as I am concerned. Too bad."
1,Lazos de Amor or Lazos de Terror (teror),It was extremely short. Lost of important scenes cut off. Story doesn't make sense. Do not recomend this novel.
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap!","Don't use these more than 4 or 5 times. The non-stick coating on these pans starts flaking off onto your food after relatively brief use. The first time it happened, I thought I had burned the crust of my cheesecake. Then I noticed the large, shiny patches on the interior of the pan. I was mortified and disappointed."
2,Ruff Rider!!,"I bought these thinking that My truck would ride smoother and get rid of the bounce and pogo effect (2000 Dodge 1 ton Dually). After I installed them I called KYB and ask if they would soften up a bit. They stated that the MonoMax shocks are 40% stiffer than Stock! Enough said. Theses are a BIT harsh for me. If I was hauling 1500# all the time as a True Work Truck then they would work out fine, Not to great without a Heavy load in the bed"
5,much better ride,Great shock at a great price. My truck rides much better and better control when towing the horse trailer. I now have KYB's all the way around.
4,Great Product,"I just started to wax my eyebrows, and this sample pack is perfect for beginners!! I would recommend to somebody trying the product for the first time!!"
1,This book was a big let down,"I have tried several times to read this to my 4 year-old. We are major book lovers & there are hundreds of kids books in our home. This book (by far) is the worst book in our collection. The cadence is really off & the words do not flow.The illustrations are fun & funky, but not really geared towards young children. Overall, it's not a good book."
3,A book for a book report,"I found this book Pinocchio a rather wierd book because it wasn't what the whole story was like and it kinda went really fast and skipped alot of the original story but it still got to the point and I could still understand what the story was really trying to tell me. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read,.....you'll enjoy it!"
5,Great for those who have seen the movie,"Kennaway wrote both this novel and the screen play for the movie so 98% of the dialog is the same as is the basic plot and story. Far more detail is given into the characters of Jock Sinclair, CLP Frazer, Pipe Major Mac Lean, and RSM Riddick. A very good read."
1,Pros and Cons,"Pros: Easy install. Straight forward in use.Cons: DO NOT USE FOR CONCEALED CARRY. The LaserMax replacement slide lock can and does pull out by hand. Meaning your slide could fall off, or worse, be launched off of your lower. Laser sight does not match installed (and adjusted) sights, off substantially. Expensive. Non-adjustable. Sight changes with every movement of the guide rod. Thankfully Amazon allowed me to return this."
2,Not the real Magoo!,"After watching a Magoo short tacked onto our Mr. Magoo's A Christmas Carol disk, my kids were in love with Mr. Magoo! I shied away from the box-set because reviews complained of censorship that ruined their nostalgia surrounding the cartoon, so I purchased several of these titles, not realizing they were a re-made series from the 70s. Unfortunately, not funny...not clever...not sharp like the original series. Boo. Disappointing!!!"
5,Must have for the Evil Dead fan,"The lighter is nothing more than a zippo copy, But works great and is a must have for the evil dead fans out there. The raised chainsaw and blood covered face is classic."
4,PS2 to USB keyboard/mouse adapter,This item works great and allows the use of legacy keyboards/mice with usb ports.
1,Doesn't work on a Sun system,"Bought this to use with a Sun Blade 1000. The mouse simply does not work with a Sun system. After email exchanges with Hawking, they admitted that the Sun support did not really exist."
4,"Excellent WWII navy story, good characters, well-written","I really enjoyed this book greatly. The dialogue and characterizations are sophisticated, both for the sailors aboard an aging destroyer and the on-shore love interests -- this is not just a boom, bang, bam war novel, in other words. Certainly, I would highly recommend it for any one interested in the genre of naval war books. But I feel I can even recommend it as a fine novel, with good writing, compelling characters and the sort of ""yeah, that was a good book"" feeling you have when you are done"
5,My son loves them,"I bought these for my 5 year old son who is a huge Car's fan. He was using matchbox cars and pretending that they were Lightening McQueen and friends, but when he recieved the set of these he was so excited. These cars are larger than matchbox cars, and are heavy for their size, good quality!! Great for the Car's fan in your life."
5,Worth it for the Adware/Spyware chapter alone,"I'm a big Jeff Duntemann fan, and I already knew about him because I bought Degunking Windows, which was a lifesaver. So when I saw that Jeff had written Degunking Email, I knew I had to get it too. My PC has been running glacially slow, and someone suggested adware or spyware as the culprit. Chapter 13 covers just that. I followed Jeff's advice and everything's back to normal - running just fine, thank you. I discovered a couple dozen spyware threats that (obviously) were slowing me down.Jeff covers the whole gamut of email problems in this book: from spam to viruses to internet hoaxes to security. He even talks about the idiotic things we do to sabotage ourselves as we're surfing the net. For anyone who has email problems - and I think that's just about everyone these days - buy this book."
4,can use on some binoculars also...,"I actually bought these to use on my binoculars, and they work very well for cutting out light coming from the sides(obviously I bought 2 of them:). Be forewarned though, that although the description says they can be stretched, and they can, it distorts the rubber flap so much that I took them off of a third pair of binoculars. They admirably fit my pentax papilio 6.5x21 binoculars, as well as an older japanese pair of nikon 12x25's. I tried them on my nikon monarch 3(8x42) binoculars and after a lot of stretching they did fit but I later removed them due to the aforementioned distorted rubber flap(why I gave this product a 4 out of 5). The rubber is sturdy and did not tear after my contorsions with my monarch 3 binoculars, so it is a quality product."
5,My husband loves it,My husband loves all Yoko Kanno's albums. I purchased it for his Christmas present. It's a surprise for him because it's been on his wish list for years.
2,fluffy soft-core,"The acting in this film is horrible! I had trouble undrstanding the lead male actor. The plot runs like a soft-core memory episode from a TV show you have never scene before. Okay, it can be fun (if you are in the right state of mind) and it does show ample nudity, but I didn't find it erotic, only a fluffy soft-core film that tries hard to be funny and never quite succeeds."
2,A Girl's Erotic Voyeuristic Journey to Sexual Freedom,"Daneen Boone (Justine) is portrayed as a nieve, overly-protected student at an all girls school, where she is kidnapped in the shower by professional thieves looking for lost treasures. Under a hypnotic influence, Justine reveals her wild exotic voyeuristic adventures which have occured around the world. Her provacative fantasies are descriptive and visually leave nothing to the imagination. Justine's sensual adventures display how she is overcomed by seduction and gradually loses her innocence, finding sexual freedom and love through her voyeuristic journeys. The plot has been sacrificed for an abundant amount of nudity. The film is a soft-porn flick, however Daneen Boone is a fresh young face and beautiful to admire."

4,"easy setup, easy to use","My install was on par with the best wired NICs I've used, including 3Com's. (I can't compare to wireless cards because this is my first) The included systray icon seems to do a good job at scanning for networks in both ad hoc and full network mode, and Netstumbler seems to see it as well.The included antenna is short but very sturdy, and stays out of the way. The connector is reverse-SMA, but third-party antenna cables are readily available to adapt to the standard N-connector used with external antennas.If you get this card, make sure you update the drivers! The SMC website has newer ""Nitro"" drivers, promising a much faster burst mode in mixed environments."
3,Not good for linux,"This card works ok in Windows, but the linux drivers are not mature. Don't buy it if you're interested in running linux."
2,HORRENDOUS RECEPTION,"Installation was easy: plug the card and use the CD to insert its drivers.The reception, however, totally sucks. It's very inconsistent; one moment XP tells me the signal is ""very good"" and the next momemt it's ""very low."" The router is no more than 25 ft a way (granted, through a wall and many objects). Still, I have another comp. that's at least 30 ft away (with many obstructions) and the signal it gets is ""very good"" most of the time (Linksys wmp11).DO NOT buy this card!"
2,range is about 11.55 feet,not the 1155 feet they claim. You practically have to be in the same room as the access point. pretty bad
1,ATTN: Crap for Sell !,"SMC makes the sorriest cards I've ever used. I bought a wireless card for my PC and one for my laptop. They worked fine at first, but after months of heavy use both of the cards stop working. I'll never buy a SMC product again."
3,may be the material is old now.,"It felt overly simplified. I had read 2-3 lines from the book on Wikipedia, which seemed insightful. This prompted Mr to buy the book, but there was really nothing new in the book in terms of material and style of presentation felt dull."
3,nba2k7 is ok,"This game is definitely better in gameplay than the live NBA series but somehow i cant figure out how to save anything besides the vip, and dont know what the purpose of the vip points are, and executing moves in this game is too hard."
3,Not bad at all!,This is a great game. It is my first basketball game for my xbox so I did a lot of research before I bought it. The reviews were right. This is a good one. The controls took a little getting used to but after that it's smooth sailing!
2,Same as 2k6,"While I still contend that the 2k series is better than the Live series at being a more accurate, fun and realistic approach to basketball, I was really disappointed with this years go around. Not because it's a bad game by any means, but because it's nearly exactly like 2k6 in terms of the play. Whereas the xbox 360 version features new player movements, animations, etc. this one is just last years version with new rosters. If you own a 360, definitely spend the $60 to get that version, but if you're like me and stuck with the old xbox and already own 2k6 then this isn't worth your time. However, if you don't own any basketball games and are wondering between this and Live, 2k7 is where your money should go. I guess last year's version pushed everything it could out of the xbox, so there's not much more they could've done. Maybe that's why this game was $30."
4,decent basketball game,"this isnt a bad game, similar to the years before of the 2k series. What i liked about this game is the gameplay what i didnt like is the bad camera angles other than that this game is decent and not at a bad price"
1,Poor construction,I received the product and within 1 week the pen was not functional. The low grade plastic that holds the tip portion broke at the barrel of the pen. This was just due to pulling the cap off the pen.
3,Lots of missing punctation,"The book is fabulous and covers some great material, but lots of the punctuation is missing. You have to excercise patience and fill in the blanks as you read the electronic version of the book"
5,Fabulous,"Extremely insightful, well worth the time to read and analyze your personality. It clarifies your strengths and weaknesses while avoiding dividing the entire world's population into four categories. It is slow at times, but stick with it."
5,Spirtiual Help,"I found this book very helpful. Not only does it talk about the four temperments but it also shows how each temperment handles their emotions. There is a section on temperment and your emotions. This section really made me stop and think about how we live our life as defeated Christians becasue we let fear, worry and other emotions take over our life. LaHaye tells of some steps to overcome fear and he also talks about how to cope with anger. This is a must read for anyone 20 years of age and up."
3,Why You Act the Way You Do,"There is a lot of interesting information about temperaments in this book. However, in many cases it is written in a judgemental and black and white way. It doesn't seem to be carefully written, as there are some inconsistencies and things the author doesn't seem to have thought through. It also tends to be repetitive. Unfortunately, Tim La Haye's temperament test is not included in the book and has to be bought separately."
2,I'm not too sure about it.... Might just not be right for me.,"This book was recommended to me by my economics teacher. He seemed fairly optimistic about it, so I decided to read it for myself. He said it would help me recognize who I am, and help me identify and relate to others, but I honestly had a hard time keeping my interest up. It became too difficult to try to read more than three pages at a time, and I finally just gave up. I did not finish this book, but it was a bit too much of a boring read for me."
1,Ridiculously Stupid,"Only an ignorant person could enjoy this book. the barbaric system of temperaments is a goofy theory at best; very limited. as i was reading the book and learning about the temperaments, i was expecting there to be a protocol of how to fix the negative aspects of each temperament. but instead the author goes into extreme religious mode and says the answer to all problems comes from ""God"" or ""The Holy Spirit."" i think this guy was drinking too many spirits. the author is never logical and has nothing intelligent to say. the title of the book is misleading, it should be called ""Just Read the Bible to Solve All Your Problems"""
2,Look Inside This Book,"This book isn't my personal cup of tea, but judge for yourself:read the book pages in the ""Look Inside This Book"" link above.If you like that, and enjoy the author's particular ""Christian advice"" view of life, you'll likely enjoy the book more than I."
4,Neat vacuum cleaner,"Bought this to clean up sand on our pontoon boat plus any liquid or solid spills from our four grandchildren. Considering that this is not a high end vacuum, it works fairly well off our boat power. We like the wet/dry flexibility feature and, overall, it's a good machine for the price. Most other vacuums at this price are not much better than toys. Would recommend this product for light vacuum cleaning."
4,GREAT RETRO!,"Unlike other 80's CDs where there is only one or two good songs, all of these are classics. With 30 songs instead of 8 or ten, I was very happy. Hopefully they will make more of this series."
4,Good resource,"This is a good resource for all the books of the Iliad; however, someone just beginning to read Homer or any original text may need more help than Benner provides. Consider either Iliad I by Pamela Ann Draper or Iliad I by Simon Pulleyn. Draper is better on nuts and bolts grammar and has the vocabulary on the facing page. Pulleyn has the vocabulary in the back of the book, but is better on literary and historical issues. His introduction is excellent: wide-ranging but concise; written in clear, stylish, non-academic prose. These texts cover only Book I. This is a good thing since it allows both authors to limit the vocabularies and Pulleyn to provide a complete commentary on that one book."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!!!,"My review does not address the content but rather this edition. When they chose an old copy of Benner to make copies from they did not choose a clean txt. There is writing that is illegible and makes many of the words hard to read. Some pages (i.e. 32 and 33) are downright so horribly copied as to be useless. Those two pages are partially covered up by some blob and page 33 is totally slanted and some of it is oddly magnified, the same thing you see when you put a book on a copier and don't straighten it enough. This is really inexcusable. Few enough students attempt reading Homer as it is, don't chase them away by making them pay a lot of money for a ""new"" edition that is so poorly put together. Do yourself a favor and buy a used copy of an older edition."
1,Don't be fooled,"DO NOT BE FOOLED. This is a very poorly done PHOTOCOPY of the real book. The Greek in the notes is illegible and quality of the pages and binding is severely lacking. It's also really big - probably in a (failed) attempt to make the terrible photocopy job more readable. It's also more expensive than the real book, which I just bought from a local bookstore for 5 dollars cheaper. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!"
2,Good text but...,"This is a good manuscript for the Iliad and certainly contains pertinent notes and info. Now that that's out of the way, don't buy this book. The photocopy job is absolutely terrible and makes accents, breathing marks, and even some words in the vocab section, illegible. Also, some pages have someone's previous notes in the margins but photocopied, not like a student's notes in pen. The manuscript itself has notes and makes pages very difficult to read. There are other editions. Find one."
5,Love this book!!!,This book has been essential in my inspirational collection. It is a must read for new and not so new believers. Book was like new and shipping was speedy!!!
2,Bad printing,A few pages of the print were off.One page is quite bad that I can't read.Can I get a refund?
2,"Predictable plot, mediocre art",This follows a pretty formulaic anime plot. Guy gets infected with government organism as part of an experiment to try and create a more evolved super-soldier. He seeks revenge and the recovery of his lost memories. The female character and her little pet are interesting footnotes in an otherwise silly and immature video.
3,A NICE ANIME BUT NEEDED MORE LENGTH AND PLOT,"Baoh was a nice little anime. It lacked a few things from getting it a 5 star. The art was great even for now, but some lines appeared to thick at times. The characters were average, they didn't have enough story behind them as for why they are there. The main character was pretty cool, just a normal guy until some scientists wanted to do some experements. His transformation is really cool and the way he deals with people is great, also this anime was very gory for its time and now. over all Boah is a must see, maybe a buy because of its length, or to some not even worth it."
4,It's clear!,"I've read many books on filmmaking, especially directing. But Mark is one of the few authors that actually was able to talk to me directly. This book has a way to surpass the bull#@!% and talk straight. It shows me how clear directing can be when understood on the level that Mark writes about. I would recommend - and for that matter already have - this book to anyone who's interested in getting down to the core of directing."
5,Multi Dimensional,"I was very relieved that the final chapter was written from a male perspective. Too often Black men are portrayed as one dimensional characters. Thank you for ""transforming"" Dante and showing that Brothers can heal themselves."
4,Dancing With Redemption and Drowning is Desire,"The first African American serial novel written by ten authors detailing the erotic journey of a young man's quest for redemption. With different writing styles, this tapestry of fiction unfolds without a hitch. Each author wrote their own chapter with Sekou writing the first and last.When Butterflies Kiss is loaded with redemption and desire. It is the story of a young man coming of age and finding his own place in the world. The first of ten authors begins the story with Dante, a poet who has more than one woman in his life and many desires.Butterflies are very mysterious critters, imagining them kissing is tough. The correlation between Dante's struggle with life and the butterflies is truly a work of art."
4,Very moisturizing,"I got this because I had read great reviews on acne message boards and beauty message boards about this product. Those are the best places to get advice on what product to try because it's been tried and true. Not only does it do its job in moisturizing my face, but it's a huge jar! The price is great for the amount that you get. It truly hydrates my skin, but I only use it on my face. I haven't tried it on my hands, feet, elbows or knees. I'm going to give it a shot.Be sure to moisturize after you use astringent on your face.One swipe of the hand is good enough to moisturize your face. You don't need too much. I've used generous quantities before and woke up with a greasy face. A little can go a long way.Lastly, be sure to moisturize the skin under your eyes, around your eyes and around your mouth. These are the wrinkle spots that you want to keep hydrated!"
4,The Cetaphil lotion worked great on my dry ...,The Cetaphil lotion worked great on my dry skin. I like that it doesn't have any fragrance and is for sensitive skin. It made my skin smooth and soft after just two uses. I'd recommend it to my friends and family. This worked better than any other lotions I've tried in the past.
3,This was a very large-sized product. It would ...,"This was a very large-sized product. It would take a long time to go through so much of the cream. I have rosacea and my dermatologist suggests I only use two different products on my face. Cetaphil is one of them. It went on very smoothly and kept my face moist. When it's first put on it's almost too wet looking, as a little bit goes a very long way. It doesn't plug up pores or cause any skin irritation."
4,Inexpensive and a wonderful moisturizer but not for hot days!,"I've used this product for years as an overall moisturizer, for face and body. I don't look my age and I ""blame"" genetics and Cetaphil cream for my youthful-looking skin! My spouse had huge problems with eczema on his legs and feet...until he started using this terrific cream. Now his skin is clear and soft where it used to be scaly and an angry red.The only drawback is that Cetaphil cream is thick/heavy and tends to run into your eyes when you sweat. It is VERY painful when it drops into your eyes. You can visually see white rivulets of sweat running down your face...no wonder it stings your eyes! I suggest that you use either the lotion counterpart to this great cream or go to another lighter-base face cream."
5,"Comfortable, durable, stays up.","These thigh highs are very comfortable. I won't go back to full pantyhose again if I can help it. The fabric is smooth, and silky feeling, and it stay smooth all day, it doesn't bunch up, and I did not need to make adjustments like pulling them up, like I do when I wear panty hose. The silicon top stays up and is comforable. I'm petite, and was worried they would be too big, but they were not, they are perfect, and super sexy too."
2,too sheer,i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing.
2,great looking poorly made,"I've owned many pairs of thigh-highs over the years, and although they rank in the top 10 of amazing looking, they RIPPED UNDER AN HOUR OF WEAR!I would not recommend these to anyone ever! I didn't even make it out of the house in these.I have short manicured toes, so that wasn't the problem, and I took my time putting them on, but I couldn't even get my heels on before one ripped. I think it's the seam at the toe that is poorly constructed, which causes the problem of rips.I'm really sorry it's an issue because they do look great, especially on short girls!"
2,"Comfy, not long lasting","I really like how these wear, very comfortable. However, I didn't have them on an hour before I had a run all the way down - from doing nothing."
1,cute but ripped,"I got these for my wife. They looked really nice on and she didn't have a problem with them slipping down while wearing them all day at work, but one of them ripped on the second wear. If they were more durable, they would be great."
5,"The very best of Buck Owens, Vo. 2","I love dealing with Amazon. no problems on this last order. On time, good condition, and I love the album. I seem to be able to always find what I'm looking for on Amazon."
4,Gray Matter,"This book shows some of the thought behind the Actualist movement in poetry. Gray's prose is more challenging reading than his poetry, but well worth the effort. Read SOMETHING SWIMS OUT or SCATTERED BRAINS to see this thought in action."
4,Zac A,"True nostalgia ! The Organ, Dance Band & Me have provided great strict tempo music , mainly through the piano of Billy Thorburn and the organ of Robinson Cleaver."
1,Unfortunate ommisions,Some serious disappointments and omissions. In describing the JU88 the author takes great pains to point out that Junkers hired 2 American experts in stressed skin construction techniques and then denigrates the head of the design team for taking all the credit and not providing any to the Americans. The author fails to name these two people however! Then he leaves out the single most famous and one of the most important bombers of the war - the Boing B17 Flying FortressMost disappointing.
3,SoSo Tank Top.,"Not what I expected. It's slightly longer than your normal tank, and is paper thin. It states its a rib tank, its not, just more like a tee. I was going to order many colors, but I am glad I waited until I saw it, because I will not buy another. I was going to send it back, but my daughter liked it more than I did for layering."
3,Racerback Tank,"I really liked this tank, but unfortunately it did shrink and wear out after a few washes in cold water."
4,Worth It,"I definitely enjoyed this, but I was a little bit disappointed in the focus on a relatively unknown member of the original Spartan class. I couldn't get behind the protaganist like I hoped, and it detracted from the experience slightly for me.That said, Nyland continues to put out the most engaging glimpses into the Halo universe that are available to fans, and this effort does not disappoint on that account. I'd rank this behind Fall of Reach (which I love), but it is well worth the time.Definitely pick it up if you enjoyed Fall of Reach and First Strike."
4,good book,great book. didnt like the fact that it doesnt really deal with the master chief or cortana but that just leaves me hangin for the next book. not my favorite out of the series but definitly a must read
1,Sad truth,"It is a sad truth this book is not available to Australian kindle users, Eric you write great books - why shut them away from the world???."
2,Not worth reading.,"I picked up this book right after reading Halo: First Strike. While I really enjoyed the first this book fails in comparison. The story focuses on Kurt, an Spartan II, and the newly formed Spartan III program. If that were all there was to the book it might be fine. However, the book has trouble centering on the main plotline and becomes a tiresome read as you'll be switching perspective every chapter, many times to characters you really don't care about. Add to that the large number of grammatical and typographical errors and it is pretty hard to finish this book. Despite the trouble I pushed through hoping the ending would redeem the rest of the story, and it didn't. Even if you're a huge Halo fan, like myself, this book is best avoided."
3,Wish I Could Say I Enjoyed it More,"All the Halo books are starting to read just the same. If you haven't read any of the others, you'll probably really like this one, but it basically plays out like a re-write of some of the others, with identical story development and individual character development in some cases, with just the names changed from previous novels. I got the feeling that there was a random firefight generator webpage somewhere where you just plug in the character names and it fills the rest in for you.""How many Covenant ships did our cunning plan destroy this time? X? and how many of our brave allies died in the process? Y? Great, another day, another dollar""like i said, wish i could give it a better review, but i just can't"
5,Redonkulous,"The book was pretty crazy cool, if u know what i mean. go buy one if u r in fact an avid halo fan."
5,a fun read,"Eric Nyland did a good job balancing the action and heroism expected of the Halo series, developing the characters and their inner struggles, as well as twists of the Halo universe."
4,"A great companion to the Halo games, average sci-fi to non-gamers","This is a great story that helps build the backstory to the the Halo universe leading up to Halo 4. I would recommend this series for anyone familiar to the video games.For someone who plans to start Halo games with Halo 4, I would recommend starting this series of novels before Ghosts of Onyx.This book contributes greatly to the understanding of the Halo universe and is highly recommended for gamers that own or plan to own Halo 4. Halo 4 is full of story elements that are fully appreciated after reading this story."
5,Awesome...he does it again...,Another good one by Eric Nylund. The book was very grasping towards the end and I could not put it down! I like the emotional connections the Spartans are getting toward each other in this one. A must read.
5,"My son says, ""Awesome!!!""",Great audio book! Better than my son was expecting. It held his interest and didn't bore him. A must for any Halo fan!!!
5,Ghosts of Onyx,Excellent reading to get away from the real world. It's a great compliment to the Halo series.
4,Good but Technical,"This book follows the previous halo books, however does not go with the same story line. Instead of following the Famed Xbox character ""Master Chief"" or John (known to us who's read the books), it follows a different path with the other spartan characters being the main focus.This book is a well written book for the Halo series. If you have enjoyed reading the other books, then you will certainly enjoy reading this one, however it gets quite technical at some points. The past books filled us with different battles, and scenarios. This book has many fictional technicalities that you must pay attention to in order to enjoy it fully. If you do not understand something the first time, read it over again because it will be mentioned later on in the book.Again this book is a great addition to the Halo series and if you are a fan of the books and like to know more than just the gameplay, then this is for you."
4,Worth buying in you like Halo.,"The book is and easy read and Eric Nylund is a very skilled science fiction author. I you like science fiction and need a quick read, or if you just like to learn the backstory of halo, then this is a book for you. I recommend reading the previous books in the series. It is not necessary but it will give you a better idea of what is going on."
4,Great book. Spans large time period.,This book takes place after the events of Halo 2 and during Halo 3. I like the perspective being from the other Spartans besides John 117. I thought the book was entertaining but skipped forward in time too often and too far.
4,good book,"This is a good book expands well on the halo universe, its nice to read about something other then a halo, or master chief."
4,Excellent Book,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I like the Halo games and books. I bought my copy of Ghosts of Onyx from Books a Million, and the only weird thing is that the book is missing pages 225-256. Instead of those pages i have pages 161-192 instead. I find this weird, and i dont know what happens in those missing pages!"
4,"Wonderful story, but a cop-out for the game","I have loved every halo book I've read. They showed me more than what the game shows you. I must have played through Halo 1 fifteen times and I still didn't understand what was going on. Why were the aliens attacking and what made MC so special. The books told me that.They also told me about the other SPARTANs. After reading First Strike I couldn't wait to play Halo 2 and fight with the other SPARTANs. I was sadly mislead. There was neither hide nor hair of anyone mentioned in the books. Shouldn't they have been there with the Master Chief?I don't want to give anything away, but this book was basically an excuse to not put any other SPARTAN in Halo 3. Something I wanted dearly."
5,Another Halo page-turner!,I found Nylund's new Halo book every bit as engaging as his previous efforts. It's good military science fiction and worth checking out even if you don't play Halo (although that would help). I have to agree with other readers that there were an annoyingly high number of typos that should be fixed for future editions.
2,"""Here's goes everything.""","Wow, I love Halo and all, but this book is boring and full of typos. What the hell? Mr. Nylund should slap his editor. There's a grammatical error in almost every chapter."
4,Proof-read!,"The story-line in the book was excellent but I have to wonder if anyone bothered to proof-read the book before it shipped. There is a terrible number of typo's. In the worst case I found, self-perversion was written in place of self-preservation. Very poor performance for what is a well-known title like Halo. But other than that it was an entertaining read."
5,Cowboy Bebop blue is Fantastic!!!!!,"Blue is a mixture of american and japanese jazz if there is such a thing. The nuances in this music are beautiful and the sounds are original and mood setting. I love the title track Blue because it takes you back to the end of Cowboy bebop and the emotions you felt when it ended the way it did. Another favorite is Wo Qui Non Coin I find it playful, simple and beautiful. It reminds me of Eds character joyous and smart. I thoroughly enjoyed this music I hope every one gets a chance to listen to blue and any music by Yoko Kanno, the seatbelts or any of the various and talented artists associated with the Cowboy Bebop series."
5,Excellent DB2 source,This is an excellent resource for DB2 whether you are a programmer or a DBA. This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. It is definitely a worthwhile investment!
3,"Good Overview, little detail on ""How To""","As DB2/Oracle DBA for 20 yrs., I find the book lacks some details on ""How To"". However, it provides a good overview of DB2 concepts, features and some examples. They could add examples on how to create some of the DB objects with the new features, more indepth coverage of utilities which are necessary for production DBA. You'll still need DB2 manuals. I reviewed/read a good number of DB2 books, with regret, I did not find a complete guide to DB2 for OS/390. So, I still think it's one of the ones you want to own."
2,"Too much padding, not enough content",This book was useful where db2 manauls were not available. Apart from that it is not a great addition to other documents already available. Too much padding in terms of catalog table layouts.
2,This book is a bit outdated,"The book was published in 1997 and it shows its age. DB2 have matured from a mainframe database to a client-server RDBMS from 1997. For instance, I was looking for stored procedure programming with Java. Of course, there is nothing about Java in this book."
2,It's only half a book - nothing about dynamic SQL,"This may be considered the Bible of DB2 books but it is lacking a whole Testament! If, like me, you are looking for info on dynamic and extended dynamic SQL to avoid having to read IBM manuals, you've come to the wrong place as this book says words to the effect of ""If you want info on dynamic SQL, read the IBM manual"" and leaves it at that. You would do better to hunt around the IBM online library and grab the manuals from there - they are actually pretty good, too."
5,Love a la Hollywood from a master chronicler.,"James Parish has done it again! He has written the perfect companion volume to his best-selling ""Hollywood Book of Death"". With a marvelous sense of humor he explores what Hollywood has done with the themes of love, marriage, relationships, etc. This entertaining look at Hollywood and what films tell us about ourselves (or what we would like to think of ourselves) is enthusiastically recommended."
4,Cupid's Arrow Hits a Bulls-Eye,"The prolific master of Hollywood historians, James Robert Parish is at the top of his game with the new The Hollywood Book of Love. Surveying scores of films - both iconic and obscure - ""that raised our romantic expectations,"" Mr. Parish fits them loosely into twenty shrewd (and often irreverent) categories from which he deftly and individually summarizes. As always, his subjective comments hit just the right tone of irony and wit. A must for any fan of movies in general or romantic films in specific. A wonderful valentine of a movie book."
5,Eddie the originator,"Here's Eddie Jefferson, the originator of the singing style from which king pleasure, annie ross, and manhattan transfer took their cue, going at it, original style.Full of funky beats and Eddie's out of this world, unique phrasing, you'll see why the pioneer is still the greatest."
4,A great runner's shoe,"These shoes are specifically made for overpronator's like myself. And when you first put them on they feel like your old tennie's that you've had forever. That's how comfortable they are. There is no ""breaking them in"". A Great Shoe for runners of any level."
5,The Best Yet!,"I bought my first pair 3 months ago and just purchased a second pair to have when I need them. THE BEST shoe I've ever owned. I ordered 1/2 size larger than my ""regular"" shoe size and that was perfect. I'm disappointed that they are discontinued - but if your size is still in stock, the price is more than right and you won't be disappointed!"
4,"It's not ""the product"" that counts . . .",". . . because an AT&T phone is, after all, just a telephone. The difference is in the sellers. I have dealt with two separate people in re-creating my original AT&T system, and they have both been first-rate, spot on, helpful, knowledgable people - - and (get this!) humane and human, too. One signs, ""By Design37,"" while the other is ""J666;"" and as I have said in earlier reviews, my own impression is that in dealing with either of these two, one cannot go wrong. Again, I thank them both. Oh, and ""the product(s)?"" Just exactly as they were supposed to be."
1,Unsatisfactory Item,The unit appeared to operate correctly for the first few weeks. After approximately 40 days the Charging Unit would not Function (no green light and no resultant charge i=of the handset)correctly. I have the base unit (purchased in an Electronic Store)that still operates after 18 months- but wanted to have another remote habdset to go with it - am sorry I ordered the unit.
4,AT&T 2462 Base and handset,"We have had this system for almost three years now. Frankly, I think the quality of the signal, audio, and lack of interference with our existing wireless products makes it a great phone system. While some of the features are somewhat counter-intuitive, the system is overall quite reliable and easy to use. We have dropped the portables a few times, and the battery compartment hatch cover is pretty sensitive to this kind of abuse, but even so, we have had not significant issues. I do find the lack of a one-button redial and a 'on busy, redial xTimes feature a minor incovenience, but that is made up for by the memory redial and LNR.Overall, a good system.- Rich. Lambert"
2,Not Very Durable,"We have owned this ATT answering system for about 2 years. After a year the ""off"" button became difficult to operate. Now the ""off"" button won't work at all, making the portable handset useless. We are now in the market for a new 2-line phone system. It will not be an ATT unit.Small wonder ATT is in such financial difficulty and is now owned by one of the baby-bells that it previously owned."
2,Aggravating Phone,"If it even tips over a little bit on your desk, and falls, just from a standing position to laying down on your desk, the battery pops out the phone dies, and your phone call is gone. What ever happen to AT&T quality?"
2,Don't Bother,"I have to say this phone did not live up to my expectations. Though 2.4 GHz was state of the art when I bought it, its range was actually less than my previous phone. There were parts of my apartment where the signal broke up, and it's not that big an apartment. Also, when you clip the phone to your belt then unclip it, the battery pops out, cutting off your phone call. Now the battery won't stay in at all so it won't hold a charge, and I am forced to buy another handset unit even though I don't even like this phone! Steer clear of this one."
5,Great for Reader's Workshop,"My son was struggling with neat post-its in school for Reader's Workshop. These lined post-its were the solution! Also, great sticking power - the Post-It brand really sticks way better than the no-name brands."
4,Beautiful Basket....Excellent Customer Service!!!!! :),"Regardless of what item(s) you purchase from Giftree just know that their customer service is TOP NOTCH!!!!!! :) Sometimes that is more important than the actual contents of a gift basket or what it is your purchasing. Years ago I was paying close to nothing for my mobile phone service but when it came time to contact them it was a nightmare!!!! It didn't matter if I called them or went directly into the store, it was the same. Eventually I switched carriers and decided to pay a bit more for quality customer service.This particular gift basket was purchased as a gift for my husband and he loved it. (I was the one purchasing it and found some of the contents to be a bit ""small"" in quantity but after posting my original review Giftree responded right away and made good with a $50 Gift Card!!!!!)I will be doing alot more business with this company."
4,An outstanding gift!,"I received this as a college graduation gift as I was leaving my Southern Indiana home. I have treasured it since. And, it makes a great ""coffee table"" book."
5,buffy move over,this show gets you to know that there are some things in life like keep friends close and your enimeies closer deal while kicking butt and feeding your lust for blood this show has it all from gay themed show and people becomeing mindless zomies for demons:)
5,Vampire Princess Miyu....,"This movie is a continuation of a story about a girl named Miyu. It is her job to banish Shinma into the darkness, and she cannot grow old and die until all of them are gone. Because of how many Shinma there are, it seems as if this is an eternal task, and she lives a life of sorrow. Her companion, Lavra, is a shinma too, and to complete her quest she must one day send him into the darnkess as well. The story has a very interesting, though sad, plot. The characterization is also to be commended. It is overall a very good and well-written series."
4,Classic example of anime horror genre,"I own this title on two laserdisc's, and it is one of my favorite examples of classic japanese horror stories. One issue is that, like The Complete Shamanic Princess, you don't REALLY know what is going on until the back story is revealed in the final episode. Just who IS Vampire Princess Miyu and WHY does she hunt the Shinma (demons) when she herself aught to be a creature of the dark? Who, or what, is her companion Larva, and why does he protect Miyu? Is there some deeper relationship between Princess Miyu and the spiritualist Himiko, beyond the obvious one of opponents? The viewer learns the truth as Himiko herself is dragged deeper and deeper into the dark through her investigations into one horror after another. Stick with this two part series. The ride has just begun."
1,Bag sucks,"The bag is beautiful, but falls apart within days of use. The topstiching started comming apart, and the leather bag started to rip by the handl. I was very disappointed."
3,Missing something...,"Filled with good information but could be improved with annual updates which include prior season records, returnees, recruit class and brief overview of coming season prospects."
3,"Good resource, for now.","With the NCAA tournament emerging as the biggest thing next to the superbowl, we can expect even better resources to come out providing more comprehensive stats. For now, this book is good enough.What it lacks in specifics (historical team stats and standings, a puzzling ommission) it makes up for in spirit and insights.- GiddyupGuy"
3,Needs an errata section,"The ESPN College Football Encyclopedia (ECFE) is a large book detailing a lot of stats on college football teams. Unfortunately, not all the stats listed in the book are true. For example, on page 782 the University of South Florida (USF) is shown to have lost it's first ever game vs Kentucky Wesleyan when in fact USF won that game 80-3! Granted, USF is not a well known school, but for the ECFE to tout that first game as USF's worst memory when USF won that game is sad indeed for an encyclopedia with the endorsement of ""A great history book and arguement settler..."" Especially when it is a fact that could have been easily checked via any of the USF media guides issued since that first season."
5,ESPN College Football Encyclopedia,Fast transaction very happy with the product will buy form seller again
