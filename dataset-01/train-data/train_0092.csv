5,"Thoroughly Researched, Brilliantly Written.","Mr. Blumenthal's book, which is partially a first-hand account and partially a grand history of American politics from the inception of the Republic is absolutely wonderful reading. Many right-wing media outlets have tried to smear Mr. Blumenthal and his terrific book, but by doing so they only prove his point, that the Right and its media allies went much too far in their irrational quest to destroy Bill Clinton's presidency, and continue to trespass upon the bounds of objectivity, truth, and rationality. Inside this book you will find abosolutely riveting details about the desperation with which the Republicans worked to destroy the Clintons--details that the corporate media has never bothered to report. I thought I lived throught the 1990s as an informed, educated citizen, but after reading this book, I can say with certainty that I really knew nothing, for wool had been pulled over my eyes by the media."
2,Why Bother...,"Blumenthal -- like most political operatives with a book deal -- has churned out an indifferently written and profoundly humourless blend of hagiography, self-justification and character assassination. (Newsflash: Sid and Hitch are not going to kiss and make up any time this century.) And like the work of most political operatives with a book deal, this will have limited appeal to anyone isn't already in the choir or researching a term paper. Three stars for partisan Democrats and those who waste their Sunday mornings watching cable talking heads. Everyone else might want to give this tome a miss."
1,Why?,"Why would ANYone value ANYthing MR. Blumethal has to say? He has been discredited so many times, I'm surprised he got published. Somebody said he was a journalist? Maybe in the eyes of those like Mr. Blair at the NY Times, but not to anyone with a brain.The book reads like one big apology and excuse. Bottom line is if you like Clinton, you'll like the book.What a read!"
1,"At Best a Silly Book for Whiners, At Worst a Misleading Tome","The irony in this book will make you laugh, at least if you're not bothered by misleading information. Is it plausible to suggest that Clinton would have done a better job hunting for terrorists if he hadn't been busy defending himself in Monica-related investigations? Perhaps if Clinton hadn't been hunting for Monica, he would have had more time for hunting for terrorists. Another misleading aspect of the book is that the press is controlled by conservatives. This is truly odd. The leftward tilt of the press is highly documented in numerous studies. I recommend this book for people who want to live in a pretend world."
2,He Said / She Said,"I purchased this book with the hope it would be an interesting and detailed study of the inner workings of the White House in formulating policy. I was also hoping to learn more about Mr. Blumenthal, who he is and how he had become an adviser to the President. These most interesting topics were largely relegated to one chapter. The bulk of the book simply rehashed every bad thing a conservative writer, pundit, operative or politician had said about Mr. Clinton. The clincher was the Chapter on how George W. Bush stole the election. Coming from a very independent minded largely apolitical person this book wound it self up with a hugh negative in that regard. An upside to this book is that it is well written and definitely expanded my vocabulary."
1,Patronizing crap,"Since Sid was an insider, any reader expecting an objective account of Slick Willie's tenure will be sorely dissapointed. Despite the meaty heft of the tome, Sid flails about weakly attempting to castigate Clinton opponents (and often on hearsay)but failing to explain the processes going on at the time that resulted in: a) the biggest economic bubble and corporate pilaging of the 20th century (sorry kiddies, you can't blame Bush for that one); and worse b) allowing al-Queda to stage smaller terror attacks relatively unpunished that led directly to 9-11. I could care less about Ken Starr and the McDougals, as they don't matter compared to what happened in NYC that very ugly day, and his boy Clinton had a major hand in allowing it to occur."
5,A book about the real state of the union,"This author really feels for his subject, that is obvious from his passionate writing. Reading this book is painful - the republican slander machine does not stop at anything to keep the power in the US to themsleves. I was amazed to read that Clinton was accused of no less than twentyfive murders in connection with Whitewater - and that was only at the beginning of his presidency! The US must clear up its own act at the same time it demands democracy in other countries.The only issue I have with the book is the comparable lack of sources and references. The slander has to be met with proveable facts, not something that can be dismissed as propaganda."
2,Lukewarm at best,"High production values, as always, but otherwise very lukewarm. The twins are attractive, but the best thing about them is their centrefold shot. There is no spark here, and no erotic tension that is really required for the twin and sister thing to work. Don't even mention this vid in the same breath as Playboy's Twins & Sisters Too from 1996. Umph!"
5,Great Sound,Great sound from a small package and will fit in a small place. They really fill out my sound. Great price also.
5,Great little tube for my 2011 F-150,"Great bass tube coupled w/a Rockford Fosgate Punch 300. Originally bought the 8"" but it was too big for my fold down seats. Plenty of punch for my 2011 F-150 extended cab and fits under the rear fold down seat perfectly! If you're putting this in a truck w/a fold down seat, this is for you. The 8"" is too big and this performs just as good!"
5,bazooka sub.,was skeptical at first not knowing what to expect from this sub.needed the extra bass but space was very limited.[installed in 2009 international prostar semi].this sub rock's.fills the sleeper cab space with awesome bass and takes up very little room.Have it hooked up to a sony digital head unit and crunch p5000 amp.very nice product.
5,"It's small, sounds great, and is relatively inexpensive","I have a 2005 GMC Envoy XL, which is a large vehicle. I wanted something that can fit in a nook when the third row of seats are folded down, and this is it.No, it doesn't sound as good as the full-size 10"" subwoofer, but it sounds far better than you would think for how small it is.I am powering it with a Crunch 1000W amplifier."
2,hit and miss,Percy Jones does not appear on this one and his absence is obvious. I really like Livestock and Moroccan Roll but not this one at all.
2,Used Used Used,"The VHS recieved was a pirated copy! Black and White case covers, nothing like the photo. The tape wasn't even rewound when I received it. Basically I received an illeagle copy of this product."
1,Worst Submarine/Military Movie I have ever seen. Period.,"I grabbed this movie while I was deployed in Iraq from a vendor on the street, and once I finished watching it, I had to check online to make sure it was actually made in the US. This was by far and away to most HORRIBLE sub movie I have ever seen---and I have seen most of them. The acting was completely flat, the plot was non-existant, and whoever they hired as a technical advisor should be shot. The uniforms were either wrong or poorly cared for, the verbiage and pronounciation of sub jargon and medical terms was off, and the appearance of the crew was nothing like what you would find in the real world----a sumbariner with a BEARD?---Ummm---NO!If you enjoy sub movies, this is one to stay far away from-----very far away."
2,Interesting Story,"Story was interesting, BUT...lame acting and I hate movies dealing with the military that show military members with hair longer than the military would allow and uniforms looking like they were slept in/worn for a few months, not to mention portray lame military bearing and custom/courtesy. Course having spent twenty years in the military this is a sore subject for me with many military films."
1,Submarines,"This movie is trash... it is an insult to the Submarine Service with so many errors it would be hard to count them all. They obviously forgot to get a technical consultant... pure rubbish, don't spend a dime on this one."
1,Not recommended - Don't Buy,"Horrible cover photo. The stereotypical ""NobleSavage"". I bought this CD primarily out of curiosity because it was so cheap. I think I understand why it's such a bargain. The music itself is okay, all traditional songs of various nations (this is not the type of music usually heard at powwows. Those looking for that will be greatly disappointed). I suppose the title is accurate: ""Authentic Native Amer. Music"" since the songs are definitely ""Native Amer."" However, my main complaint is the lack of liner notes. The song list is exactly as noted above, no names of groups or individuals or even when the recordings were made. It makes me question if the songs are correctly identified by tribal affiliation. The quality of the CD is poor. Most likely these songs were ""reproduced"" from old recordings with the intention of making a fast buck. Don't waste your money on this. Use it to buy the many other high quality CD's produced by Native Amer. artists."
2,Might be worth the money...,"Poor sound quality on many tracks, but for the price, ok as a very general introduction to traditional American Indian music. This CD -- with the same songs in exactly the same order -- was released a few years back by the Legacy International label as ""Authentic Music of the American Indian""."
3,MOST LIKELY UNLAWFUL,"These recordings were probably recorded without permission; hence, the lack of named singers and inappropiately named songs. There is a mixture of traditional pow wow and competion pow wow songs (not to mention the inappropiate recording of ceremonial songs) on this cd. The poor recorded tracks speaks for themselves that they are most likely unlawfully recorded."
4,Another Christmas present for a friend.,This is for a person who likes all things Native American. So I'm sure it will be appreciated. I was able to listen to some of the music myself on iTunes so I got a good idea of what it sounded like. It's very good.
3,I had high hopes for this one...,"But I was disappointed after the third chapter. The premise of a very old vamp taking on the identity of a dying human that he happens to resemble had some promise. I enjoyed the fantasy of the connection to the animals and the vamps powers...but then it takes on a Feehan-like quality with the human heroine our vamp connects to. She's slightly unusual, I'll give the author credit but I felt like the time and place didn't really come together in this one. It was surface level. Emma Holly writes well and I know I've enjoyed other books of hers more than this one. Ah well, on to the next one!"
3,Emma Holly Fans Please Read,"I am a huge Emma Holly fan and was excited to read some of her older work. I have to say this was not a favorite. It is not bad by any means, but it is also not what I was expecting from a Holly book. The characters are not written as well as they usually are and the love scenes are a bit boring-not typical Holly! I would suggest buying this book super-cheap (which is what I did), if you're curious, and saving the real money for a better Emma Holly book."
3,low production value,"very low. cool interviews with the incredible mc donald brothers, but live performances are mostly patched together form separate shows."
3,Just One Last Heist.....,"Nice film to pass the time, but nothing to write home about as the saying goes..... A bit on the slow side too.Just your average diamond heist film! Take two diamond thieves, played by Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayak, out to steal one last diamond before going into retirement to a tropical island for the rest of their lives.....Woody Harrelson plays an FBI Agent out to capture Pierce Brosnan's and Salma Hayak's character's in the act of stealing a diamond, but fails miserable & is suspended from the FBI. Harrelson catches up with them in attempts to capture them in the act of stealing a rather large diamond one last time!"
3,After The Sunset Pretty As A Picture,"After The Sunset was the type of film that entertains and is easy on the eyes. Some of the scenes are simply beautiful and make you long to vacation in the Bahamas. If your looking for a film that gives you an all around entertaining experience, this film is for you."
3,OK Heist Movie,"This is a good movie, because of the fact that you have a triangle of things going on. You have Brosnan and Hayek who are retired diamond theives in a land of paradise. Their fued starts when a cruise liner comes to port with a rare diamond which puts a wedge between Bronsan and Hayek. Then you add the FBI agent; Harrelson who doesn't like the either of them and has escaped his clutches for the last 7 years. Yet he admires Bronsan for he cleverness and just the way that he operates; add an attractive local Police Officer who gets mixed in with Harrelson and you have a comedy - drama to boot. This is a great movie for anyone who enjoys movies because it has everything to make a great movie. Not to say this was a great movie, because it wasn't, but it was funny, and easy to enjoy."
4,An entertaining film,"This wasn't a bad movie, I don't understand why it didn't do better at the box office.... I've certainly paid much more for tickets for big films that hardly entertained...."
2,Mediocore Movie,This shouldn't have been more cleverly written movie. Instead it depended on sex-appeal to sell the movie. Which wasn't sucessful because it lack a plausible plot. The save of this movie was Woody Harrleson and Don Cheadle who is great as the bad guy.
3,COOL SEXY GETAWAY. MUCH BETTER THAN EXPECTED,"Overlooked at the box office, AFTER THE SUNSET (Warner) is a cool, fun caper set in the Bahamas at Paradise Island's Atlantis Resort (talk about product placement!).Pierce Bronson is a thief allegedly on the verge of retiring with his beautiful girlfriend Salma Hayek. Woody Harrelson is a goofy, discredited FBI agent obsessed with catching Bronson. This movie is a throwback to films of another era. And much more entertaining than I expected. In fact, I liked it a lot.There are extensive, watchable extras on the DVD. My two favorites (besides Hayek in a bikini): a better than average making-of featurette and the interview with a real jewel thief."
3,Not A 5 star Jaw Droping Action Movie But A Very Good Comedy,"After the dissapointing TOMAS CROWN AFFAIR, this movie was a masterpiese! although it has not new and even reasonable story in theft scenes, but it's full of really funny sequences. it's more a comedy & romance movie than an action one.as a professional film critic and dvd collector, I suggest u, if u want to buy this dvd, buy it from the used items with lower prices cause it's not worth 21 dollars!"
3,"A few laughs, but not enough","It's a gem heist flick crossed with a buddy movie, set in the tropics with a double love interest to try to hold your attention. I only laughed when Woody Harrelson, as a hapless FBI agent, gets trapped in limos with jewel thief Pierce Brosnan remote-controlling the vehicles. Otherwise, it's a bit of a snoozer that makes zero sense. Harrelson is miscast. He always works better as a bad guy. Brosnan's hairy gut flab may be a turnoff. At least Hayek is in shape. The whole thing goes very soft after the taut opening. Worth a night's viewing if you have nothing better and don't wish to think at all."
3,Routine Entertainment,"If you're looking to kill a couple hours, this movie might fit the bill. It's a standard caper flick with FBI agent Harrelson playing cat-and-mouse with master jewel thief Brosnan. Nothing groundbreaking: you have formula characters in a formula plot. On the minus side, the acting is uninspired and the plot has holes big enough to drive a freight train through. Still, the interplay between Harrelson and Brosnan is fairly amusing and Salma Hayek certainly enhances the visuals despite her one-dimensional character. There's nothing exceptional or objectionable here, just an above-average cast making the most of decent material."
3,I Liked It,"Utterly generic and unsurprising, but thoroughly enjoyable. The Bahamas are positively stunning, as is Salma Hayek and the other female lead (unfortunately, her name escapes me). Hayak and Brosnan have great chemistry, looking and acting completely comfortable and believable together. As for Brosnan's ""less than Bond-like physique"", did it ever occur to critics that he deliberately let himself get like that for the role? Never bothered me--he's one of few men who can pull off that scraggly look and still be hot.A decent way to spend two hours on a Saturday evening.So the DVD will contain outtakes? I hope one of them is the one shown on Letterman or Conan last fall (Hayak and director Ratner switched places behind Brosnan's back as he made a phone call, when he rolled over to kiss her, he completely flipped out upon nearly locking lips with Ratner. LOL!)"
2,Lame,"There are one or two comic moments that makes me smile, but on the whole it is boring. The technology is lame. The heist is lame. The twist at the end is lame. There is a camaraderie between Brosnan and Harrelson that works in spite of the material. However, it actually hurts the movie in some ways. It makes it hard to believe the level of antagonism that is needed to exist between them. Hayek is beautiful and likeable, but her revealing wardrobe does not redeem her one dimensional character. I kept expecting the movie to soar a little, but it maintains a very low key, mediocre level through out. Very disappointing. I like the actors and the location so I am giving it two stars."
2,One extra star for Salmas body,"This movie started off pretty good, but quickly went downhill. If you're looking for a movie with alot of action, this isn't it. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's far from the best. I gave one extra deserved star, for Salmas body!"
3,Not bad for the $$$,"Had this grill for almost 5 years. had to replace the cooking grills three times. The cover lasted 3 years. cooking side to side not easy to cook at different temps. If you bought from costco and have reciept, take it back. The new stainless is only $100 more. Good luck!!"
5,Judy Garland's Quintessential Christmas She Never Had,"This CD is a Laserlight collection of Judy Garland numbers over her years from youth to maturity. Judy herself never recorded a Christmas album, but this is the one you will cherish for years to come. Remember that the title is not just ""Christmas through the Years"", it is also ""... and songs of inspiration"".For the price, this CD is a tremendous value. If you are a fan of Judy Garland, it is the one to have."
2,A bit of a disappointment.,"This one just felt like it was cobbled together clumsily from whatever tracks could be found easily and which fit the general holiday theme, however awkwardly. Still, if you want a recording of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, this disc gives you two. [The disc I received was different from what appears on the item page: mine was from Laserlight, not Delta. Its track listings are different from the Laserlight disc: The Birthday of a King was missing; the additional version of Merry Little Christmas was added.]"
1,Christmas Through the Years - Judy Garland,"I purchased this item for a gift as the one song my mother has been looking for the past 4 years was listed on this CD. When it arrived the song ""Star of the East"" though advertised as being on the CD was not... also the song ""The Birthday of a King"" was not on the CD. Disappointing after I told her that I had found the song that she was searching for and then when she played it the song wasn't there."
2,Ouch,"This is kind of like when Elvis went Vegas-y....The voice is still decent, the music's just sort of too Vegas-yDefinitely not Mr. B"
2,Mr. B is out of his element,"""Stormy/Feel the Warm"" is the album by this great artist to avoid. He sings mostly songs that were popularized in the 1970's. The songs here may have worked with other artists, but Billy couldn't make these his own and as a result he sounds a little bit rediculous. Stick with his earlier work."
1,CAUTION- NOT A CD,"This is not a CD, it's a CD-R. It won't last as long, and won't play in all CD players. It's also available on a regular CD. The warning refers to the 2009, $11.98 (at this time) version."
3,Probably cost 5.00 to make...,"Wow, I mean I wasn't expecting the nicest thing ever, but this thing feels like it probably cost a whopping $5 total to manufacture. I bought it for my 1400, which isn't an expensive shotgun by any means, but this kit just feels extremely cheap. I should have listened when people told me just to shell out a little more for a wooden stock. Mine was cracked. This kit should NOT have cost 51.99 before tax. I think a fair price for this product is more in the 19.99 range. Buyers remorse over here. Do yourself a favor and find a wooden stock or at least something made out of a composite or something nicer than this cheap a$$ plastic mold."
4,Very good product,I have tried many Whey Protein Isolates. Now's protein isolate disolves very well and has a good taste. I like the 100% natural aspect of Now's products
5,Blastmaster KRS and DJScott-La-Rock--The Emperors of Hip-Hop,"This album has it all. Phat beats, deadly baselines, and crazy snares make this album a masterpiece. KRS-ONE amazes the listner with his lyrics, while DJ scott-la Rock puts out dope tracks. This legondary album is a MUST for any true Hip-Hop fan! Once you've heard ""The Bridge is Over"", the infamous ""South Bronx"" or the comical ""Superhoe"" you'll agree!"
5,The Defining Moment of Hip Hop.,"A majority of the hip hop music out today is not worth five cents. The turning point from classical hip hop into a modern solidified sound occurred during the period of 1986 to 1989. When BDP hit in 1987 with South Bronx and a few months later with criminal minded, they joined the ranks of Eric B. and Rakim, Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J and The Beastie Boys. Truly, Criminal Minded has had a lasting effect that can be felt even today. It is ashamed that hip hop has entered into an undefined conglomeration of unpoetic and untalented producers, DJ's, and MC's. Stick with old school like BDP and modern techno."
2,same difference,"if you own already own criminal minded on cd you can leave this one alone,it's nice to own a videoclip from bdp but for the other extra's : forget it .it's the same thing b-boy records did before :use the little material they own from bdp and re use it over and over .if you like this sort of product check ultramagnetic's critical beatdown and shan's down by law re issued versions they both have real previously unreleased on cd versions that are worth having,like krs himself already said on the second album :b-boy records you just can't tr..t,just one live version that's ok.wait for a jive records version."
5,The essence of old school hip hop...,"This is arguably one of the best rap albums ever made. Every single track hits hard - with bass you can feel, and beats that make you want to get up and dance. I can remember going to parties back when this record first came out, where the only music was this tape... played over and over again... people just kept right on groovin' cause every track is phat!!Just about every song has been sampled extensively by more recent artists - a definite keeper."
4,Classic Hip Hop,"This album is one of the all time great album. If you don't have this,you don't have a collection."
1,NO BRIDGE IS OVER VIDEO!,"Just bought a second copy when I couldn't play the bridge is over videoon my first copy I bought a couple years back. Same thing with this one.My computer couldn't find any video on the so called ""enhanced cd"".If you are like me and only want it for the video beware.."
2,GREAT FOR IT'S TIME,"NICE CD, FOR IT'S TIME BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME APPEAL THAT IT HAD BACK THEN!"
2,Isabel disappointmented me for the first time!,I have read nearly all of Isabel Allende's books and have loved them. This is the first one that truly disappointed me. It is certainly not representative of her fine writing. It seems disconnected and doesn't flow. I also felt there were too many characters and too much history packed into an average length book.
1,Disappointing,"I am a very big fan of Isabel Allende, but I just couldn't get into this book. It was okay, but her other books are better."
4,"A good, but not necessarily believable story","I enjoyed the book and found it an easy and fast read. It is a story about human nature, the need to find one's place and the journey through life. The characters do reflect the normal up and down emotions that we go through in life, but the characters are not necessarily always believable as a whole. For example, would the male leader of a latin barrio in LA be a follower of the made up religion of ""The Infinite Plan""? Probably not. All the main characters seem so ""extraordinary""; even the adopted nephew of Carmen is a math genius. The coincidences that occur to the characters in the book are even more unbelievable. So, if you want a good story, if not a necessarily believable one, then read the book. If, however, you like to read fiction that ""could have happened"", then pass."
4,The Infinite Plan,"This is the first Isabel Allende book I've read, and it certainly won't be the last. The story is absorbing and the characters are so interesting."
3,No real difference...,"I have fragile, fine hair, and I was looking for something to stop the breakage. The good news is that this didn't cause any more breakage, but my hair remained in the same shape it was in before I started using it. It just maintained the status quo. I finished the bottle, but I won't buy more."
3,Someone needs to proof read!,"Although the pictures are excellent, there are MANY errors made when it comes to the captions. Anyone with any airline knowledge will soon enough notice the errors with regards to the aircraft types noted, airlines noted, and in general unacceptable errors. I was going to call the publisher in Manhattan (close to where I live), but never got around to it. For lack of better example, the book is the size of a hotel Bible ( or Book of Mormon for us Marriott fans), although thicker. Captions are multi-lingual. I probably would not buy it again. Also...for anyone that is into old airline/aircraft photos like myself, you have seen about 60% of the photos before."
1,One of the most pathetic movies ever made.,"The guy playing Sinatra can't sing a lick and has a hillbilly haircut. The guy playing JFK doesn't have a trace of a Boston accent. And there isn't anyone in this poorly writen, badly directed movie that can act."
4,IT'S AMAZING,"This is a movie everyone,even nonsmokers must watch.It's touching,educative and life-changing."
2,"Music rated 5, Video rated 1...","I am and have been a TD fan since the Rubycon days. I had owned the Tangerine Dream CD ""Oasis"" for quite some time before purchasing the video. There is nothing technically wrong with the video, but I believe that the music stands on it's own without the visuals. In my opinion, the video does not compliment the music. I still listen to the CD on a regular basis, but haven't been inclined to watch the video anymore."
1,Don't waste your money,This album is a disaster. It deserves one star because I bought it without listening to it prior to the purchase. They turn 180 degrees away from the blues and try to rock out. My coffee cup has been resting on it on my desk after the first listen. Save your hard earned money and buy everything else they put out. The other stuff is great. This is a joke.
4,A very good movie for all ages,"I read the book and I saw the movie on TV as a child. I loved them both. I was a bit hesitant to buy the DVD, thinking as an adult I would find it childish and boring. (The main reason I bought it is that the Sons of Liberty song kept going through my head.) In fact, I was entertained and pleased. It's important to keep in mind that this was created as a two-part TV show in the 1950's, so the story is highly condensed and sanitized (for instance, a major character in the book has a better outcome in the movie). Still, it makes a great companion to the book, and I can very well imagine a young person seeing this DVD and wanting to read the book and - - wonder of wonders - - maybe other books about the American Revolution. I should mention that the sets and costumes are amazing. You won't see quality of that sort in a modern TV show."
4,Movie Review,"The movie captures the essence of the book, however it does leave out some important aspects of the book and some characters are left out. If you are looking for excitement this is not it. The relationships and the causes leading up to the war are still there. I am using the book to teach historical fiction the movie will will be watched and we will compare and contrast the two for a tie in to language Arts.The book as in most cases is better."
2,It just wasnt like the book,"Hi, I had to watch the movie in school (8th grade) and we read the book too. It just wasnt the same as the novel(thenovel was way better)! Take my advice and dont waste your money on the movie. If you are interested in this point of history and stuff, spend your money on the book!The movie doesnt even have any details and left out so many of the main charaters that were in the book. It was like watching a movie that wasnt even complete. Hope i helped!"
2,No Justice done to the book,The book was alot better than the movie. Disney changed to many key details which gave the book more adventure. They also added some unneeded pasts in the video. The book was historical fiction and I give it 5 stars.
3,Needs To Be Redone,"This Disney version is great for giving a 5th, 6th or 7th graders a peep into pre American Revolution times, but if re-done in the 21st century, special effects would easily replace map paintings. It is of little value in an English class, because it does not stick to the author's script. For example, omitted are Johnny's companion apprentices--Dove and Dusty, Lavinia Lyte, Dorcas, Isannah, Madge, Mr. Tweetie, etc. Consequently, themes such as envy, sloth, religion and blue sky laws, colonial life, death, fraud, greed, marriage, arrogance, and more are not presented for discussion. In fact any student depending upon this film for the total Johnny Tremain experience, would fail any test questions rooted in characters in the book, but not represented in the film."
2,Johnny Tremain revisited,"I saw this movie when it first came out. I was fourteen years old and I thought Hal Stalmaster was really cool. I got to thinking about the movie again recently after watching the series ""John Adams"" on television, so I ordered it. Now, fifty years later, I see it as sort of a kids' movie that doesn't have a lot of depth. I'm glad I saw it again, but I can understand why Hal Stalmaster decided to give up acting. However, I would love to know what happened to him. I've googled him every which way and he seems to have vanished off the face of the earth."
5,excellant,This is a wonderful movie for anyone interested in the Boston Tea Party. It does not go as deeply into the Revolutionary War period as the book by Esther Forbes(which I also recommend). It can get a young person interested in other facets of that time period or bring back pleasant memories to those of us who discovered it in our younger days. Disney had a way of making American history fun as well as interesting.
5,Tremain - Disney formula still works to create interest in kids,"I bought the Johnny Tremain movie to show my 10 and 8 year old boys not only about history of our great land, but a bit of how my interest in history began as a young boy, and explain how we watched television back in the 60's. Entertainment was different then, and how life was different for their parents. They loved the movie, the timeless film helped them understand our nations' beginning, and is well worth the price. Outstanding!"
3,Johnny Tremain,It would appeal more to someone my age who watched it as a child. Today's kids would not get it at all.
4,Johnny Tremain a 'sugar coat coming',"I though it was a good flick, but I have not read the book. It treats a heavy subject lightly. A little history with a lot of sugar coat."
2,A disappointment after reading the book,"My daughters and I looked forward to watching the movie after reading the novel but we very disappointed. WHile reading the book, we had great conversations on the committment to change and the beginnings of revolution which were so profoundly expressed in the novel. The movie seemed to trivialize and negate the emotions involved in both the Boston Tea Party and the beginning of the Revolutionary War. Many of the great characters of the book were completely left out or not touched on, as in the case of Rab.On a good note, though, it was a good Disney movie with no foul language and a good happy ending. We would have enjoyed it far more had we not read the book first."
5,Timeless,"I am a fourth grade teacher. After our unit on the Revolutionary War, we always watch this movie. It never fails to thrill the kids."
4,Great film!,This was used as a follow up to the class reading assignment and it was a great resource.
5,Pretty good old movie,"I saw this movie when I was a kid, but had forgotten a lot about it. I remembered that I liked the movie back then, so I bought it to see how it impressed me now. Although not 100% historically correct, it's a pretty good story. The book was originally written for young people (teens & tweens) and is more detailed and more historically accurate than the movie. Disney Studios left out about half the story; I guess Disney didn't want to get bogged down in details. Also, the ending is changed. Nevertheless, it's still a good instrument to get young folks interested in the Revolutionary War period."
4,Johhy Tremain,I got this DVD for the American Revolution. It's Disney and a cute propaganda piece. I had my nephews and niece watch it for shoot and run. They loved it and then played minuteman out in the woods.
2,I did not like this book!!,"I had to read this book for History and I figured it was going to be a pretty dumb and boring book. Well, guess what? I was right! I really did not like this book. It was boring. Some parts of it were o.k., but it seemed like it went on and on and on with no point really. And it may have been a little bit exciting if it were a true story, but i mean i know all this stuff really happened but not to someone really named Johnny Tremain. Anyways, I really did not like this book."
1,Boring!,"R u guyz Krazy? How can u like this BORING movie?! we had to watch this at school in 8th grade, which was totally pointless, it's really boring!"
1,Weak link,"the movie stunk. First of all the movie had all the details mixed up and how could u not have the Famous John hancock or laviinia Lye as a character.In stead of Dove there id some guy named caleb. talk ABout disney making movies they cant meake anything true. i REGRET I BOUGHT IT. 50% OF THE MOVIE WAS ALL mixed up stuff, totaly differnt from the book and the other 30% was bad quality effects even for an old video released."
2,Prime video Johnny Tremain,I planned to watch it a second time & it would notLoad properly. I tried several times and continued to have server issues.
4,Pretty good,I remembered this movie from my childhood watching The Wonderful World of Disney. Since my daughter is studying the American revolution I thought she might enjoy seeing this old movie. She did. We enjoyed it together.
3,"A nice effort for its times, but a bit dated...","Johnny Tremain was a tiny Disney movie on early American History (or was it myth?). Yet it captured the minds and hearts of kids and adults of the time and helped spread some historic culture throughout the land.Having said that, the modern perspective of things has changed all this and by today's standards it is at best a nice little adventure movie, but nothing more.Many inaccuracies and liberties with historic fact have made it into what it is: a nice escapist movie.The acting is solid and keeps you involved. Nothing to be said there.The image and sound quality is impeccable considering the age of this movie (1957). Colors are vivid and there are only minor picture flaws that disappear completely to the untrained eye.It major plus is, that it is still highly commendable as a family movie. Much more than more recent movies are..."
2,"In a world of beautiful sound, why choose the ugly?","I was really disappointed with this CD. I wasn't expecting much - environmental CD's tend to be like wine, the more you pay the better the quality. I purchased this to stock up on whale song samples (long story, don't ask) but this one I played once and promptly put back into the CD shelf where its been gathering dust.I've only sold a used CD of mine 3 times, many years ago, but this one actually has me thinking about dropping by my local Used CD store to pick up a buck or two in store credit."
4,not bad,"Samsung's YP-T5H is a very attractive model that feels rather well-made. I decided to choose it over comparable iRivers, due to their added bulk and somewhat 'plasticky' appearance. I've had it for quite a few months now, and its intuitive, easy-to-use interface coupled with its ability to double as a flash drive (it really is plug and play--never had to use the included software cd at all) are a major plus. The quality of FM depends on your location--sometimes you'll get static, and other times it will be clear. The battery life is somewhat disappointing, which is why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5. Overall, not bad."
4,Pretty good MP3 player,"Pros: easy to use, GREAT SOUND, so small it fits in a pocket, comes with earbuds(great for smeone who doesnt own any yet), and has a FM radio tuner(many mp3 players do not)Cons: poor battery life(maybe want to invest in re-chargables), Directions were very difficult to understand when it comes to transfering files from computer to player(it took me a couple of hours to figure it out)... FM radio doesnt usually work(static), but thats probably just due to reception(i'd hope so, anyway)"
4,"Good MP3 Player, but complicated instructions!","This MP3 player produces great sound and it is so small you can put it almost anywhere! Lots of accessories come with it, but the instructions on installation of this product were very unclear! I just got the product yesterday and I spent 2 hours at the computer trying to figure out how to install it properly. I still haven't figured it out. Other than that the product works great and is exactly what I expected!"
3,Poison ivy product,"This product is good if you know you've been exposed and use it exactly as directed. It is used to clean all the ivy oil from your skin. If used correctly when a rash first appears, the rash usually doesn't get worse but it is no good for the itching."
2,No llena las expectativas,Las recetas que incluye este libro son recetas que requieren mucha elaboracion ademas al final es mas de lo mismo.
4,Good not Great Green,"""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" was the fourth album recorded for Blue Note by the power trio of Grant Green, Larry Young and Elvin Jones, and the third under Green's leadership. Whereas Larry Young's ""Into Somethin'"" and Green's ""Street of Dreams"" (the second and third albums respectively) are indisputable five star efforts, this one falls a little short. ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" adds Hank Mobley to a group that performs all covers/standards, including the Beatles song and Antonio Carlos Jobim's ""Corcovado."" The album overall is enjoyable, but this lineup was clearly running out of ideas by the time a fourth session rolled along. That being said, it's far more creative than Green's later material on Blue Note."
3,Surprisingly mediocre,"You would think anything with Grant Green and Elvin Jones (drums)on it, not to mention Larry Young (organ)would yield instant chemistry. Unfortunately, this recording never really wakes up. ""Speak Low"" is as exciting as it gets, nice but not awe-inspiring. Check out ""Solid"" instead."
3,Too polished,"This is not the pure, country beauty that Pam has been known for. It is more polished and includes such lightweight offerings as ""Space"" and ""I Smile"". The most glaring miscue is the R&B sounding ""Be a Man"". It is about half a great album. Some tracks are the cleaver, country gems that you love to hear from Pam. ""Which Five Years"" is as outstanding as any song that she has ever done. My mother liked this album better than I did."
5,That voice !!,"Here in South Africa we don't have any country music on the radio.The only way to find country music is to search the internet and then order it. I am not taken into any direction by the radio and only hear the country that I have on CD.""Thunder and Roses"" is one of the cd's i listen to the most.The best tracks are Space, Tryin' and I Smile but the others are just as good. I'm looking forward to the CD from Pam Tills of her father Mel Tillis's songs and will buy it."
2,"good music, badly recorded/mixed","Shirley Scott, On a Clear Day. Good 1950s-1960s jazz organ-trio music, maybe a little restrained. Unfortunately the drums were mixed too loud and they stand out in a distracting way."
4,Excellent!,"This book is a MUST read for anybody interested in the direction our country is going, and everyone should be interested. The reason I say that is because if you have children, your children will be affected by what is going on in the world today. The first way to change what is happening to our country is to have knowledge, and this book clearly offers you the knowledge you need to begin making a difference. I purchased the book because somebody recommended it to me,and I am glad they did because there were things I read in the book that I was not aware of. I think we should all be aware of how much the government plays a role in our daily lives. As a mother of two kids I worry what their future will be like if we don't have the knowledge to make the changes that need to be made today. Remember the saying ""Knowledge is Power""! A great book, and a must read.."
4,Must Buy,I have to say that this is a must buy if you are a Sheen fan. This movie shows how well the Sheens can work together. The movie has plenty of action to keep you intrigued.
2,Second rate home movie,"Charlie Sheen produced this home movie starring his father (Martin Sheen), his uncle (Joe Estevez) and himself. This is a B-minus film about dirty cops involved in a drug deal. Almost everything about this film is second rate. The story is predictable and unoriginal. The dialogue is mindless and insipid. The photography is dull and the music is awful. The only redeeming elements are the stunts and pyrotechnics, which are reasonably well done.The acting is mediocre at best. Charlie Sheen is often embarrassingly bad, leaving his dad to carry the film. Uncle Joe is just a throw in to keep the family employed and adds nothing to the film. The three drug goons are wretched.Charlie Sheen's once bright career continues to grind gears with this clunker. I rated it a 4/10. Action lovers might enjoy it, but others will want to pass."
5,Her best book yet!,"I loved, loved, loved this book! As soon as I began reading it, I was hooked. Both by the characters and the story. I read The Penny Whistle a long time ago (when it first came out) and I was riveted by this story from the very beginning. I can't wait for the second book, so hurry up BJ! :-) I have to know what happens with Maggie and Mr Stuart and Maggie's father and Kenny and Maggie's sisters...So bravo on this wonderful story and I will be camping in front of the bookstore for the second book!!!"
5,Growing up Irish in Kentucky mining town,Well written book about a young girl growing up in a rural Kentucky mountain mining town. It tells how they lived from her experiences centered around their small school. This is a good and easy book to read and the 1st in a series of three books.
3,A well written book full of hope...,"This is the first book that I've read by the author. I have found very good descriptions. The author is a great observer. Scenes are so vivid.You get to know a few characters pretty well because the author has decided to write from different point of views. Her work becomes rich that she is able to handle it pretty well.From the beginning to the end, her words played music to my ears. It's a beautiful story about hope. If you do decide to read it, be prepared for a gripping story that touches your heart."
4,Good Sequel,"I thought that this book wrapped up the stories in this series rather well. The antagonist TJ finally got his comeuppance only to be redeemed in the end. The story starts off with TJ piloting a plane to stop his cousin Cassie from marrying Daniel. In his pursuit he crashes the plane in the mountains and is rescued by Teresa Lewis who is in the mountains to write a history book on black Americans in Aviation. TJ has amnesia, badly burned and has lost his eye sight. The couple is stranded in the mountains due to a late season snow storm. Teresa is a nurse by trade so she nurses him back to health and they fall in love. The excitement begins when he starts to have flash backs and he realizes that Teresa is part of the Lewis clan that he has been harrassing. Great story."
4,NICE & SWEET WITH A TWIST,Ms Starr is amazing writer. She writes plots that are sweet enduring and romantic. The book IRONIC has a twist to it the main hero is bigot race hater and the heroine is a black woman. Grant TJ or Trey lost his memory in a plane clash and he depend on heroine to heal his wounds. The fun start when he get his memory back. The book is very romantic. The plot was difficult and believable. If you want a sweet romance with a twist this the book for you.
4,Should inspire all to look within....,This was a great book I thought over all. The deeper meaning behind finding your true self and that love is essentially colorblind was so great. I really liked the book and it was a very quick read. Things that you do in your past come back to haunt and can sometimes destroy the things that you love. However in this story love really did heal a troubled soul and conquer all. Great read.
5,Good Book,"I like the way PLS wrote the ending for the Lewis clan. I found TJ to be funny, yet strong. It was a believable story."
1,Worst book I've ever read....and I've read a lot!,"This book has got to be the absolute worst! I wanted several times to just put it down and leave in unfinished but I had to see it through simply because I'd started it. I regretted picking it up almost immediatley. Although the subject matter gave the book great potential the author failed to make the book entertaining or even remotely believable. Terrible plot, story line and everything about this book just plain sucks. Don't waste your money or time."
5,Worm'swort mhmmmm..........And Frog's Breath ?,"I tell you what NECA is just amazing when it come's to Nightmare Before Christmas figure's and this certain figure is just stunning Dr. Finklestein come's with alot of accessories like frog's breath soup, skull, santa's workshop book,a present wrapped in halloween ribbon's and the best for last his brain haha any way I will have to say my favorite thing about this character is his wheel chair it actually roll's and the control knob's moves up and down also the top of his head open's up now this figure is extremely fragile it's more of a display piece for sure than a toy if your a big Nightmare Before Christmas Fan and collect get this cause I would strongly recommend this to you.Articulation: Both glove's rotate a full 180 degress, Torso shift's left to right, Head is on a ball joint, and both leg's can rotate left to right.Articulation Final Score: 9/10Paint Job: 9/10Detail: 9/10My Overall Rating: 10/10"
4,Classic scorps with bonus,a classic Scorpions album with the bonus addition of Rudalphs Fantabulous guitar brother Mike. A good extra guitar to replace Uli. This album is a must have for scorp fans.
4,More of a soft album of the Scorpions,"It isn't as hard rocking as all the other Scorpions album, but it is still a great album. The best songs in there would be ""Loving you Sunday Morning"", ""Holiday"", and ""Always Somewhere."" Those songs wouldn't be the most hard rocking songs of the Scorpions, but they are one of the best soft rock classics of the Scorpions besides the song ""Still Loving You"" from the album Love at First Sting. I recommend this album if you are big fan of the Scorpion's songs, hard of soft."
4,Another Piece Of Rock!,"Lovedrive came out in 1979 and it was the first album for guitarist Mathias Jabs, after virtuoso Uli Jon Roth left the band. Michael Schenker, ex-UFO and the Scorpions original guitarist featured on their debut Lonesome Crow, was asked to re-join but he eventually decided to go solo. Apparently he played on three tracks. This album has a lot of variety, from the reggae rock of Is There Anybody There to the rock steady instrumental Coast to Coast. Then there are the two ballads, the emotional Always Somewhere and the relaxing Holiday. There are also a couple of over the top rockers, Another Piece Of Meat and Can't Get Enough. Last but not least are the cool title track and the excellent Loving You Sunday Morning (sounds like Michael on lead guitar). All in all Lovedrive was a good diverse album by the Scorpions. Four and a half stars!"
4,Scorpions change direction,"With the departure of original guitatrist Ulrich Roth in 1978, The Scorpions entered a new phase in their career. Micheal Schenker who had just left UFO was added as their new guitarist, and the band adopted a more commercial approach, but still maintained its artistic integrity. They would later forfeit it in the mid 1980's. A must for any Schenker fan, Lovedrive contains some real gems such as ""Holiday"" and ""Loving you Sunday Morning""."
4,-Schenker Reunion- brief but great!,"Michael Schenker rejoins his first band for an awesome hard-rock album, probably the Scorpions best. I know Michael plays lead on the songs indicated, but if you listen to ""Loving you Sunday Morning"" you will swear that was Schenker. And I do believe that I read in an interview that Michael says he played lead on 4 or 5 songs not 3. Whatever, it is a great album and a huge milestone in Rock n Roll. Sadly it lasted only a few months. The Scorpions music today is very average at best, maybe they need another jump-start; MICHAEL are you out there?"
2,Weak effort by a band in transition,"With the departure of Ulrich Roth, the Scorpions underwent a dramatic and obvious change of style - from unique and non-commercial to blatantly commercial. Nothing wrong with commercial (if it's good), but clearly the guys had not yet found the refined sound of such albums as Blackout and Love at First Sting. The only good songs on this album are the title track and Loving You Sunday Morning; the rest are either sleepy ballads or run of the mill ""rockers"", all noise with no melody. Simply put, LOVEDRIVE is a lousy effort except for two songs. The previous album Taken by Force presents a far more interesting format with less obvious commercialism. Don't waste your time with this one - you're not missing much."
5,Another great sculpt for a little known character,"Hasbro has done a great job sculpting this little known character from the ""sidelines"" in 'Revenge of the Sith'. They could have used another characters body and stuck the old Calamari head on it, but instead they did the right thing and gave us a totally new figure. This tough to find figure was easy to find at Amazon!"
2,Don't bother.,"I had always seen these clocks in movies and TV, and when I saw it on amazon, I knew I had to have one. The first one I got didn't wag it's tail or move it's eyes. The product actually has it's own troubleshooting directions. I had to take out the eyes and tail and clean them, and it was a huge hassle. I just bought the thing, I shouldn't have to already be fixing it. I still couldn't fix it, so I eventually called the company and got a replacement after being jerked around for a while. The new one I got worked for a while and just recently now has stopped working again.So sum up, it looks cute, but seriously, don't bother, it's not worth it."
5,Unity of Good,"This book written by the discoverer of a religion over a century ago, tells uw who we are in truth and in God. Very informative aond concise about the true meaning of life and how to live it."
5,You'll never look at predestination the same way again.,"This cult classic, well-known among professional philosophers,sketches the history of Western philosophy and theology in a series ofcartoons involving . . . pigs! One meets the Stoic pig, hip-deep in snow, defiantly facing the winds of adversity; the Anglican pig merrily tricylcing along the Via Media; the Rousseauean ""noble savage"" pig; the Nietzschean Superpig; the Kierkegaardian pig making a leap of faith; and so on. I saw the first edition of this book in a friend's collection over 20 years ago. When it briefly came back into print in 1992, I bought 5 copies, of which I still own 3: one to lend, one to keep, and one which, someday, I might give as a present.It should be required reading in every Intro to Philosophy course."
3,What Butterflies?,"I was hoping to see the images of the butterflies which are in the original printed version; but this version (mobi/Kindle) does not seem to have ANY images! If the images were in it, it could be a good field reference."
3,"beautiful chant, uneven quality","As another reviewer stated---it's chant and nothing more. I was disappointed with several tracks (especially the first one), which have a very waivering quality that is obviously a ""mastering"" problem (first copyright listed is 1975, which tells you something). There was not a good flow from one track to the next, which made the listening experience rather jarring at times. Unless one is interested in collecting recordings of chant that has the original monastery bells in the background and feels that authenticity is hallmarked with ""rough"" recording, this one is not for you."
4,impressive,"this is the 3rd album released by eric roberson. i would describe him as a more thorough musiq. almost all of the songs on this release have a good vibe. he has a perfection to his sound that most r&b artists these days lack. i highly recommend this album. and in case you are wondering, ""I have a song"" is the track from the end of the movie Prison Song that many people have been trying to find."
4,"The Title should be ""The Vault 4.0""","I ordered this cd after browsing through amazon r& b artists, and his name popped up. Wow! This Cd is tight! He is a cross betweenDwele and Raheem DeVaughn , yet he has his own vibe! I am going to cop his other cd's because this one is so good. Standout tracksare ""Couldn't hear me"", ""Right Back To You"", ""Please Dont Leave Me"", ""Deaf Ears"", ""Past Paradise"" , ""She Ought To KNow"" and bonus track ""I Have a Song"" , ""Rock with You"", and I'll give the mostoutstanding track on the cd ""Find A Way"" 6 stars out of 5!!!!.This track is awesome! (sounds like Dwele). This is one cd thatanyone who loves neo- soul has to add to their collection.SATISFACTION GUARANTEED!!!"
4,Not spectacular but easy to watch,"While it's showing its age a tad, this is an enjoyable movie which is easy to watch."
5,"Great book, definately read for interesting insight","This is a great book, whether you are a novice Titanic buff, or really into it, this is a must read for ALL Titanic freaks. I read this long ago, before TITANIC came out in the theaters. When you read this, go see the movie again, a lot of some things that appear in this book as fact are also in the movie, which made it more heart wrenching and REAL. Also, see the movie by the same name, based on this book. It is also great."
5,Impossible to put down!,"A wonderful book, I read it in one sitting. A must read for anyone interested in the true tales of the ill fated ship.."
4,"Good Book, Better Movie","This was a good book, but some parts were dull. Especially when he gave a those facts about different things. I thought James Cameron's movie was better,there was more action in the movie"
3,A light read,This is an enjoyable quick read for anyone interested in history. Expected it to have a bit more detail and last a bit longer.
4,A great factual book,This book has great facts and makes you feel like you are experiencing the Titanic. The characters were hard to keep track of though.
4,The grand-daddy of all Titanic books...,"The grand-daddy of all Titanic books, and still one of the best. Much has been written and updated since this book was written in 1955, but it still holds its place as the one that started the interest in the grand old ship, and her tragic fate. Just the starting point for anyone interested in the Titanic..."
4,Night to Remember,"This book is absolutely riveting whether one is fascinated with the Titanic or not. This particular telling of a well-known, often related tragedy is all the more powerful because it is told in the voices of those who lived through it."
4,Very Interesting,"Very good read, my only complaint would be how much it bounces around. You don't have the chance to get attached to any characters, but I found it very interesting, nonetheless."
5,Still The Best You Are On Board The Titanic Read,"James Cameron and I are the same age, and I first read ANTR when I was nine. It blew me down, especially the part where Major Peuchen rappelled down the side. (The Rank Movie should have used an actor that was not an English idea of a Yankee. He was as Canadian as James Cameron and me. I saw him, spot on, in Boat Six with Mrs. Brown. Jim. Why did you not show his descent? Better than Jack and Rose endless running.)But read this book. It was written in the 1950's, before the discovery of the ship's remains; but Mr. Lord corresponded with almost all survivors living at the time, and had all the survivor accounts published in books to that time. He wrote what was known, or said was known. It comes from them, and it is a masterly job of putting it all into a chronological account.It is the BEST ""You Are There"" narrative about the tragic night."
4,Almost like you were there!,"Very informative as well as exciting reading. This publication reads like you were there seeing everything unfold before you eyes.Worthwhile book, one I'm sure I will pick up again and read with as much enthusiasm as the first time."
4,Well written account of the Titanic,Great historic read on accounts from actual survivors worth the look. Definite read if you are interested in the titanic.
4,Engaging,Captivating lots of actual facts and insights into the tragic events of that night. Moment by moment actions by crew and passengers allowing the reader to feel as if you were there.
5,Titanic,I really enjoyed this book. It was a comilation of first-hand interviews. It was very easy reading. My husband even read it and that is saying a lot.
3,It's just okay,"I bought this book when it was a Kindle Daily Deal, and I am glad I did because it would not have been worth the full price. This book is sort of awkwardly written, and pages are sometimes devoted to things that seem like minor details, while several points of interest or characters I'd like to have read more about are touched on and not mentioned again. I am sure there are more interesting and well written books on the subject."
5,I recomend this book to anyone who likes the TITANIC.,This is one of the most powerful books that there is. This book is great for anyone who loves to read or just loves the TITANIC. This book takes you step by step and gives you all the details and the last words of Captin Smith himself. This book starts out when the ship hits the iceburg and ends when it's all over with. This book is good for anyone over 12 and just for good reading. This is the greatest story that I have ever.
3,Dated,"A Night to Remember is my first book about the Titanic, and I must say that I didn't really learn very much what I had already seen on the movie. Surely, the book offers a much more dramatic account of how it had happened. But somehow, several of the details in A Night to Remember are either murky or absent. Sometimes, the language is needlessly dense which caused obfuscation of the events. The later chapters are much worse especially after the Titanic sank. All in all, there has to be a much better book than A Night to Remember."
3,Ok book but not enough action,I thought this book was too boring. I did not like how this book described the clothes that everyone had on. It seemed to focus on fashion more than the Titanic sinking. A major difference from the book and the movie is that the movie had main characters. The book was described everyone and just told the story of the Titanic from a minute to minute concept. The book was an average book and I thought it could of been better. The author could of used more action words and other minor things.
2,CAUTION,"Bear in mind the following fact when reading this book: it was written in 1955. Lord interviewed a lot of characters still a live. He prefered not to create dialogues nor try to figure out what was going through people's minds. But, read a book with one thousand characters and not one of them being special is sometimes hard work. The narrative ( a kind of journalistic style ) is dry, typical of that age. The facts pile one after another with no time to sink into the reader's brain. All in all, I don't think it is a good book, but just a good attempt to write a good book about the TITANIC."
1,Never could download,I have a Mac computer and never could download the book. A waste of my money ? I think I best use my app store
2,Boring,In my opinion A Night to Remember is a boring book! It has it's moments where it's good but most of it is pretty bad! Most of the book is peoples quotes. You don't get a feel of what really happened. There also wasn't enough emotion. They made it seem like it wasn't a big deal. When they did express the action in in this book it wasn't exciting. On a scale from 1-10 I would give this book a 4. The reason why I wouldn't rate it any less is because I have read much worse books and compared to the other books I have read this is about in the middle of the rating system.
2,it was ok,"I thought that the book was ok. I liked how Lord gave details about what individual people were doing during certain events. But, then again, it was really dragged out and was boring at times. But it was interesting to know how poeple found out about hitting the iceburn, and what they went through."
2,Not so good,"Judged by the reviews below, you'd thin this is a masterpiece, maybe the best bok ever written about TITANIC. But then you'll realize that the book is just 208 pages long ( appendices included ), it was written in 1955 ando so, consequently, lacks many new material that surfaced along time. It's a good book only for someone who is introducing himself to the TITANIC."
2,WAY TOO DETAILED!!!!!!!!,I wanted to read a book that was generally about the Titanic's sinking not the literal second by second account. Because of it's detailedness this book really drug on and on and on!!!!! It normally takes me at the most three weeks to read a book I'm not really interested in. A Night to Remember took me a wopping 7 months because it was soooo boring!!!!!

4,Great Book.,This book was well researched. I enjoyed the almost minute to minute details this author presented of the sinking. I also liked how he brought out the feelings of the actual people who experienced this tragedy. It made you feel like you were there. I recommend this book to anyone who has a moderate interest in the history of the Titanic.
4,A very fascinating and interesting book.,A very fascinating and interesting book. When you start reading it is hard to stop. If you are looking for one book to read about Titanic this is the one.
5,WOW,"We ave all read about the Titanic and we have all seen a million movies about the Titanic but this book certainly seems like the ""real story""..Again I was pleased with the speed with which I received the book and also the condition of the book. I can't tell you enough how glad i am that I started using Amazon for all my reading material."
4,Live the Night,"This book is not, nor tries to be, a complete forensic account of the tragedy. What it achieves superlatively with concise eloquence, is to place the reader amongst the travellers, eavesdropping on factual conversations as the nightmare progresses. It's emotive and riveting. And without ever raising the question, per se, it leaves the intelligent and empathetic reader challenged, and thinking: what would I have done?"
3,Just get tarp instead ...,"When I first bought this I'd thought it would fit my fire and ice nice and snug, but it was very loose. I guess this was made for ALL grill. I'd was thinking this would be custom made for the thermos models, I was wrong. Just spend a few dollars on the tarp, you will save a bundle and it will do the same job for you."
2,Not as tough as I would like,"I have used this cover for 2 weeks here in the Washington DC area. Temps in the 20's. The cover developed a few tears during normal use. The plastic is quite brittle, perhaps due to the cold. The cover should be a thicker, better grade of plastic."
1,not what i expected,i ordered a large grill cover and received one that was too small for my grill. i was given a credit for the purchase but still had to eat the shipping and handling charge. i was told that there were no more covers. i'm not a very happy camper. a.b.
4,Figure is great. Packaging not so much.,"Anyone ordering figures from Amazon would be well advised that their items will be suitable only for opening.I know that not everyone is a collector who keeps their figures on the card.However, if I was purchasing ANY item in a brick and mortar store, I certainly wouldn't buy anything in a smashed box. I don't know why Amazon has a policy of shoving these items into a box that is barely big enough, while simultaneously crushing the packaging."
3,Full of Beluga harmonies,"I purchased it as a part of a mammal report my son was doing in school. It only has 2 ""songs"", but it definately gives the listener a good idea of what the Beluga whale sounds like."
3,Subtle language of the deep,The sounds and language of the Belugas are not nearly as dramatic or interesting as the Humpback whales. The Belugas sound similar to birds whereas the siren calls and whooping of the Humpback are more entertaining and certainly more distinct and unusual.
2,Lacks In Depth Subject Matter,DVD treats subject rather superficially and not to the depth I was expecting. There are better Lowrance DVDs on the market than this particular brand.
1,Not worth the money,"This gives limited, confusing information and is not worth the money. I wish Lowrance had better instruction available. Don't waste your money."
3,Billy's final two albums for Stax.,"By the time of these two albums' release (1972 and 1974, respectively) Billy Eckstine's career was on the wane. ""Senior Soul"" is a mostly-uninspired album in which producer/arranger Artie Butler gives Eckstine current Pop and R&B hits to interpret--with mostly disastrous results. ""If She Walked Into My Life"" is an MOR/Jazz Ballad album in which Mr. B.'s rich, liquid baritone excels at interpreting lush, romantic ballads."
1,This book is a real downer,"I am usually receptive to this type of book given that I am a vegetarian with vegan tendencies. However this book depresses me. The author throws meaningless barbs at everything in his path. No new information is found in the book that cannot be found better presented elsewhere. Indeed some of the information is wrong or dated. In addition, the author also has numerous annoying attempts to use cute neologisms. I am slogging through this slender volume due to a misguided work ethic but I am hardly enjoying the ride. Yuk."
5,It works.,"I wanted to get to try my hand at baking bread so I got this machine and the book ""Bread Machine Magic"" by Linda Rehberg after reading reviews. Not only does the stainless steel look good on my kitchen counter I now wake up to the smell of bread - hmmm heavenly. Well worth the price"
1,Amazon shipped me a refurbished item,"I just opened this item, which was listed for $89.99 one week ago (I see now that it's gone up to $119). It's obvious that the item I received was previously opened or used, because 1) the twist-ties that secure some of the items have clearly been untied and tied again, and 2) the exterior plastic pieces on the breadmaker have lots of little scratches in them, a telltale sign that they've been cleaned. I resent the fact that Amazon is representing this item as new (or that they're dealing with such a questionable supplier), especially now that I see other reviewers have received this breadmaker in used condition as well. Perhaps I still would have purchased the item knowing it was ""open box,"" but certainly not for $90. I'm now awaiting word from headquarters as to how to proceed. Buyer beware!"
1,Breadman NOT new-Used and Dirty!,"I cannot believe any company trying to survive a recession would send their customers refurbished, defective, and even dirty items!! What are they thinking? I will never purchase this company's product ever and I will certainly make my family and friends aware of their disgusting and unethical performance. Amazon should be ashamed as well putting old reviews at the top and burying this company's deceptive practices that are very clear from another board on this site that I have since found."
5,Great Value & Yummy Bread,"We owned a couple of different bread machines in the past, but none were as affordable or attractive as this one. On top of that, it consistently produces delicious breads! It offers both a small and large, horizontal loaf but has a very small footprint for kitchens with limited counter top real estate."
5,A Novice Takes It For A Test Drive,"I ordered the Breadman TR-875 the other day when it was a Gold Deal. I have never used a bread machine nor made bread. I read the reviews for the Breadman and discovered the Hodgson Mill, referenced by a Breadman reviewer. While my Breadman was being prepared for shipment, I ordered a case of 9-Grain. They both arrived the same day and I spent the evening discovering the Breadman. The next morning with trepidation I ventured forth to make my first loaf of bread, and posted a picture here and for Hodgson Mill 9-Grain Bread Mix. I cut the heel and had soon eaten almost half the loaf. It is fabulous. The way that bread is intended by Mother Nature. Today I just completed making the other five loaves. Every loaf was perfection - Six of Six. Everything was so simple, with a little research. A TEXAS-SIZE thank you Breadman. I am one proud novice; soon to be considered a professional. :)"
5,Great breadmaker - BEWARE AMAZON SHIPPING!!!!,"I just finished eating the first slice of bread from my first loaf and it was amazing!! I followed a recipe straight from the instruction book and watched as it turned out a beautiful loaf that smelled wonderful and tasted even better.My only gripe is how Amazon chose to ship this item. The first one came damaged due to poor packaging. I sent that one back for an exchange and the new one came with less packaging, though unharmed. So check your boxes, but once you have an intact machine, this is a winner all the way!"
4,"Beatiful, high quality bread. A bit slower than other brands. Not too noisy.","Beatiful, high quality bread. A bit slower than other brands. Not too noisy."
1,Did not work!,"This breadmaker was defective, had to send it back and I am still waiting for my refund. I was not pleased. Thank you."
1,Very Disappointed.,"Had much difficulty removing the bread pan on the very first try. But then it came out so I followed the manufacturer instructions to clean and do the initial burn off cycle. After the burn off, the pan could not be removed at all (as describe by several other reviewers on amazon and elsewhere on the web.)Obviously a flawed design. Very unfortunate for me, I was really looking forward to using it. But I'll continue doing it the old fashioned way in my own oven."
1,Unhappy baker,"I can not understand why all the good reviews about this machine are about, I bought it based on the reviews but my results are far from satisfactory. So far we've baked three loaf of bread and not a single one was even okey.Red mill, regular and cinnamon bread, also Pamela's sandwich bread, what a disaster. I wont even feed it tomy dog... One was under baked, one did not raise, and the last one was hard as a rock. Are they any suggestions?Gluten free flours tent to be a bit dry but come on I was under the impression that the machine could deliverdecent quality. We follow the bag instructions, measuring and leaving the egg at room temperature, we usedoil instead of butter looking for a semi-soft loaf of bread, added the liquid first and the dry last, stillcan not understand what we are doing wrong. The machine seems to be in good shape working properly. I amreally tired of paying the high price of gluten free breads, no having a choice, I seek help, ideas or comments."
4,"So far, so good!",I purchased this to replace an older machine I had because this one makes 2lb loaves. I usually make whole wheat/wheat germ bread which is a dense loaf of bread. But this machine makes it perfectly. I've made about 6 loaves so far with no problems. It's settings are fool proof.
5,Great Bread Machine,"This is the first bread machine I have ever had, and so far I like it a lot. Have made 2 loaves of the Basic Bread, and both loaves turned out perfectly. My family loved the bread. The machine itself is easy to use, fits well on my kitchen counter, and the silver and black matches my stainless steel appliances perfectly."
3,Defective,"I purchased this bread maker for the gluten-free setting. For the most part I've found it works fine. Gluten-free bread rises great. However, on the gluten-free setting you can not change the loaf size to 2.0 lb, or even adjust the baking time, as the manual says you should be able. You can only bake a 1.5 pound loaf. I actual purchased two of these bread makers both have the same programming defect."
5,Best thing I could have ever done,"I have always wanted to make my own bread but was always too lazy to do it totally from scratch (by hand) I had been looking for a breadmaker for quite sometime and saw the reviews for this one and decided to give it a shot. I love it! It's so easy to use and clean up. The only thing I wish I could do is make smaller loaves. Even if you make a 1.5 lb instead of 2lb loaf, it's still fairly big. I have made bread every week since I bought it and recommend to anyone who wants to make great fresh bread!"
1,Impossible!,"I have order THREE of these in the last two weeks trying to get ONE that actually wasn't damaged. The first one arrived Christmas morning with a BIG dent in it. The second one arrive with a dent AND had CRUMBS in it! The third one just arrived -- and you guess it - was DENTED and had dust and dirt in it! I give up! Amazon has a SERIOUS quality assurance problem with these units! I would STRONGLY suggest that if you really want this Bread Machine that you wait until they get another ""batch"" -- or find another retailer."
1,Used and doesn't work right,"I got this through Amazon for $79.99. It is a used unit with scratches. The worst is that it doesn't work right. The unit never stops unless it is unplugged. Once plugged in, it will go to whatever menu it chooses and never stop again. I called the customer service, and was told that a replacement would be sent to me. I need to wait and see that happen. Regardless, it doesn't worth the hassel."
1,Total failure,"Didn't even get one loaf out of this thing. Received it for Christmas but didn't get around to opening it until recently. Out of the box, I cleaned it and ran the burn-off rapid cycle, but when I tried to make my first loaf, the paddle spun 3 times and stopped. I could hear the motor switch operating, but the paddle wouldn't spin at all. This thing is JUNK! Since Amazon's going to stick me for a reduced refund because it's past the 30-day return period, even though I just opened it, I'll try my luck sending it straight to the manufacturer. BEWARE THIS POORLY MADE MACHINE."
1,Don't Buy This Machine,"I ordered this machine. I was very excited when it came. I followed the instructions to run the machine empty to burn off any oil residue. The machine quit half way through this. It never turned on again. I called the manufacturer. The customer service person I spoke to said ""You must have burned out the motor. This happens all the time."" What kind of product is this? It shouldn't be sold at all. Now I have to go through the inconvenience of returning the machine."
1,"Received a dented refurb despite buying ""new""","Exterior box and breadmaker package in perfect condition and sealed. When opened, the front was dented, the word Breadman was scatched and smeared and there were fingerprints on lid (underneath a loose plastic bag to make it appear new). Never had a bad experience like this with Amazon. Since this was purchased from our bridal registry, and had no paperwork inside, it seems there is nothing we can do. I don't even want to use it or have it on the counter because all I see is a glaring dent in the front center."
1,Another used machine?,"I order thousands of dollars of DVD's and other merchadise from amazon, and sometimes they really screw up. They sent me a referbished machine, not new and didn't tell me. It didn't word longer than a few moments before it stopped for good. I could have bought it from Target for the same price and it would have been new. I guess I have to think again about where I order my stuff if they try and sell used merchandise as new."
5,Great Bread Machine!,"This bread machine is wonderful. I have had others, this one is by far the best. The best feature is how the bread pan simply pulls out of the machine . It is very simple and easy to do. This machine makes a great loaf of bread every time. Every kind I have tried comes out great. The large buttons are easy to use. I would highly recommend this bread machine."
2,Need help! Top keeps falling...,"I just bought this item & have made 6 loaves now. All have failed as the top & sometimes the sides, have fallen in.I followed recipes from the manual plus 2 from online. I've adjusted the yeast, flour & liquid ratios (as the manual says fallen tops is from too much yeast and/or liquid). I've even purchased a different brand of yeast, all with the same result.Can someone please tell me what I'm doing wrong? I don't think it's the unit as it seems to be performing correctly, but I just can't get a successful loaf out of it."
1,pan is stuck,"just like karry scotts review [...], i was excited to get my new breadman for the gluten free cycle. opened it up, attempted to remove the pan by ""pulling gently"" (as the manual instructs), then attempted pulling hard, maneuvering the clips, standing on the counter and pulling with all my might while my daughter pulled down on the machine with all her might, and there ends my journey with my new breadman. off to return it. very disappointed and sad. :("
4,Gets the job done,Have been using the machine at least once a week for about two months. Purchased for gluten free cycle and it is quite a time saver. The machine is larger than I expected.
3,Breadmaker for Gluten Free Option,"I love the style, design and operation of this breadmaker! I was disappointed to have to send it back. The reason being is that I upgraded from my previous Breadman machine to get the gluten free setting. I was recently diagnosed with celiac disease and wanted to start making my own bread. The gluten free setting did not work for me as I attempted various recipes. It did not brown the bread on the dark crust setting or bake it thoroughly. If you don't need the gluten free setting, I would highly recommend it."
1,I should have listened to the reviews,I read the reviews and thought I would throw the dice. Well I lost. I ordered the Breadman for my family that have all been recently put on a gluten free diet. We made one loaf that came out delicious. Two days later I poured in all the ingredients (which are extremely expensive) and turned the machine on. The machine gave a few clicks and that was it. Dead........... I should have listened to all the reviews that stated the same scenario. It obviously happens a lot. I am extremely disappointed in this product and I think that The Breadman corporation needs to do some additional quality control.
1,Buyer Beware!,"I purchased a NEW machine, but received a used one. (crumbs in the machine, factory packaging missing, surfaced grossly scraped). Ok, so maybe occasionally it happens...so I return it and ask for a replacement. The replacement came, I got excited and couldn't wait to open it. It was worse than the first. I was assured the machines were new, when I called to complain. They claim they 'investigated' the situation and I was assured they were NEW from the factory. I consider myself intelligent, and was insulted that they'd have me believe scraped, crumb laiden machines were brand new from the factory. Needless to say, I demanded and got a refund. I went with another company and purchased a Zojirushi and have been extremely pleased. Buyer beware!"
1,Unhappy with gluten free bread and machine,I have not been happy with the machine. When first learning to use it I found I could not change choices and after calling the company was told it would have to cycle through them. The first loaf of gluten free bread was thrown away. The second was not suitable. I feel like sending the bread machine back because I am annoyed each time I see it on the counter.Judie
1,Never again...,"...will I buy a Breadman product. This had major problems from the get go. Unfortunately, I bought it at least over 3 years ago and today was my first time getting around to trying it. It was very disappointing and had many of the same problems that I have read about here."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I PURCHASED THIS BREAD MAKER FOR MY DAUGHTER FOR A BIRTHDAY GIFT IN APRIL 2007 AND THEN PURCHASED A SECOND ONE FOR MY SELF A FEW WEEKS LATER. MY DAUGHTERS MACHINE BROKE A FEW MONTHS LATER (AUGUST) AND SHE RETURNED IT FOR A REPLACEMENT. SHE HAS NOT RECEIVED HER REPLACEMENT AND WHEN SHE INQUIRED VIA PHONE SHE WAS TOLD THIS ITEM IS NOT IN STOCK. I SEE THIS ITEM IS INDEED IN STOCK AND SHE HAS BEEN LIED TO. MY DAUGHTER ASKED FOR A REFUND AND WAS TOLD IF THIS ITEM IS NOT IN STOCK IN ANOTHER MONTH THEY WILL GIVE HER A KENMORE REPLACEMENT. SHE DOES NOT WANT A KENMORE, SHE WANTS THIS SAME TR8752-BREADMAKER OR A REFUND. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM HERE?"
1,"Good product, extremely poor backup spare service","This is a great machine. However, after much use, the bread pan failed and needed replacing (This also happened on our earlier Breadman machine). Breadman contract spares out to Fox International, who inturn contract this out to a company that handles Black & Decker spares.Our replacement bread pan and paddle arrived from Fox Int. Neither the bread pan nor the paddle matched together. It is a nightmare to try to correct the problem. After multiple long waits for a 'customer rep', we have been told to send back the items at our cost so that they can determine why the incorrect products were shipped. This was after the second call that they requested us to return the itemsThis saga has made us move to a different make of bread machine and a non Black & Decker customer. Companies that use Fox Int does not make for good long term repeat customers."
2,smells like skunk,"This machine kicks out a great whole wheat gluten bread. However it smells like skunk! I noticed this when I got it out of the box in December, but thought it was oils that needed to burn off. Five months later it is still stinks up the corner of the kitchen where it is stored. The bread tastes fine, but it has me wondering if it could be unhealthy if it smells that bad."
1,Breadman,I was excited when my gluten free bread machine arrived. I made a loaf of bread...it did not knead or rise. I thought I made a mistake so I tried a second one. the same thing happened. The machine was defected. It did not knead or mix up the ingredients. I sent it back. A huge disappointment.
1,not at all what I expected,"This machine does only work sometime. Two loafs came out OK ,then the next two awful, did not rise at all. Several years ago I owned a wonderful machine, can't remember the brand, it died of old age about five years ago. Was hoping that this would operate the same way, but not so lucky this time. I am very disappointed."
1,Toxic Bread,"I had to return this item after two loaves of bread because the paint coating on the paddle started to melt and chip, leaving who knows what kind of toxic fumes into the bread. I was not the only reviewer to have this problem. Also, even though I followed all directions regarding first-usage to burn off the manufacturing odors, they still lingered into the bread. Finally, while I can't speak to other bread machines and their paddling, having the paddle get lodged in the bread when you pull out the bread is kind of an odd inconvenience...One other note: many users who gave negative reviews because they received a used bread machine noted that there was no clear plastic covering over the buttons when they received their item, though others reported that that should be there. Mine also did not have this. I wonder if mine was used/returned also?"
3,"It's Fine, has a couple glitches",I received this right before Christmas to make a few breads for the holidays. The breads were great. I have found that I need to be around when it is mixing as the pan is square and the dough doesn't quite hit the corners to get any flour that's caught in there. I've had to put in a spatula and manually push it to the middle to get caught in the dough ball. The other thing is I haven't figured out to put it on a timer for just a dough. I've figured out how to time it for bread if you're baking it in the machine but I make alot of French bread and take the dough out and shape it and cook it in my oven.
1,Used Repacked Again,"If my company used Amazon for a vender they'd be history. After reading the reviews I was disturbed by the prevalence of complaints that Amazon was sending people repackaged, previously returned machines. I thought that they must have wised up and discontinued doing this by now. Wrong! If you want this crummy service, buy from Amazon. Personally, I will NEVER buy another thing from them. NEVER!"
1,Breadman TR875,"I haven't used it yet, simply because it has such an odor to it. When I opened it up, it smelled like it had been sprayed by a skunk. I washed the pan and have tried to wipe down the inside, but it still stinks. I don't want to make anything in it - because who knows if the smell will transfer and make stuff taste skunky. Anyone else have that issue? If so, what can you do to make the horrid smell go away?"
1,Problem with a seal,"We ordered this machine at the end of January 2010 and 8 months later we noticed that the seal on the bottom of the bread pan was leaking. I have to call their Customer Service but out of 3 bread machines that we have had so far, this one lost the bread pan the fastest... :( not very happy customer !"
4,"Solid, Satisfied","I also got this when it was the gold box special, and had read the reviews stating refurbed units were being shipped. Well mine is either new or a very good refurb.I have used bread machines in the past and I find this one to be excellent. I particularly like that the pan is thick enough too cook the bread evenly. Too thin of a pan and the bread will not cool evenly.As for the noise of the machine, it is perfectly in line with what I would expect. It is going to make some noise, as it should, because its kneading dough. If enough force isn't being exerted, which will make some noise, then the machine would not be doing its job. Keep in mind the manual process that the machine is replacing: kneading, punching dough.Overall I have found this machine to be well worth the purchase price and am satisfied with it. I withheld the fifth star for the possibility that this unit was not new."
4,Wonderful!!!! Easy to use!,"This is an awesome bread maker! It's easy to use right out of the box, It's also very easy to clean. It makes wonderful bread and is a great addition to my kitchen. My only complaint would be that I think it sometimes over bakes the bread. I usually make sure I'm around when it's baking so I can watch it and take it out early if I think it's getting over baked. It's my first bread maker and I'm very happy with the purchase."
5,Breadman Bread Machine,"This is my first try at a bread machine and I could not be happier, it works so well that it is amazing.... I find myself standing over it to watch it work, it is facinating ! Excellent product and I would recommend to anyone."
2,wrong machine,"I bought this machine 11 months ago, just 1 month too late for the warranty. I liked the machine and had great luck with all my recipes. Today it just stopped working. This is much to soon for this machine to break."
2,Don't buy this one,"I've been getting poorly shaped loaves since I started with this machine except for one loaf which was a one pounder. Anything larger reaches the top of the machine and becomes almost impossible to remove from the pan. Perhaps it's me but I had much better results from a $35 machine I bought many years ago. I'll keep trying.A year or so later, the shapes have been better but the paddle causes the loaf to stick and when trying to remove it from the machine, takes a great chunk out of it. Asked the company for help but no response at all."
3,Forget the Gluten Free Setting,"For 10 years I had successfully used a Regal bread machine to bake gluten free breads. When it finally gave up the ghost, and I had to replace it, I bought the Breadman TR875. The first time I used the Breadman on the gluten-free setting the bread came out raw and I had to add nearly 1/2 an hour to the baking time. However, since I bake a bread at least once a week I decided to experiment. The second time I used it, I tried the Rapid Whole Wheat setting (#3). That was successful. The next time I baked the bread on the Basic setting (#1)and that, too, was successful. You do have to use a rubber spatula once or twice during the initial mixing cycle to reach the corners and get all your flour blended, but I am now satisfied with this breadmaker. Whether it will last 10 years like the Regal is a good question."
1,You get what you pay for,"Be warned that though it looks nice in the picture, this item is cheaply made with a flimsy plastic door with plastic hinges which will probably snap off quickly. I can't tell you how quick, because my supposedly new item was shipped with the hinges completely snapped off on one side & stress marks in the plastic showing on the other. To be fair, I am rating this unit harshly to reflect my irritation with the fact that this is a replacement item for the defective Breadman Ultimate Pro which I received from Amazon in April. At least the nearby post office is located in a grocery store, so I can buy bread as I am dropping this unit off for return. PS - 0 stars should be a rating option"
3,Nice,"Funny how when Amazon sells something you cant leave seller feedback? Amazon shipped me this product, I wanted it as a gift it came in its original manufactures box and it's is a return, there are finger prints all over the unit and packaging mentioned in the directions are not in the box or on the unit. Thanks Amazon."
3,"Works, but Amazon is sending used ones as new","It does work as described, and makes nice bread. But they are shipping used refurbs as new ones."
1,Up to 1 year to replace!,"This machine has a computer problem. Sometimes it starts properly and other times it doesn't. It also occassionaly skips a step in the baking process. Also, the breadpan is held in the machine by thin metal clips which bend easily, making it hard to properly position the pan. We followed the manufacturer's proceedure for replacement under warranty. That was over 4 months ago. When I called to find out where the replacement was, I was told that they are back-ordered and that, per their warranty, they have up to 1 year to replace the machine! I've replaced this with a Sunbeam model 5891 for less than half the cost. It works fine."
5,fantastic bread machine,"This is a wonderful product and has produced the best bread!! I work a lot with 100% whole grains and this machine handles them really well. My only thought is that it is noisy, but it is worth it for the healthy, hearty bread that it turns out."
4,"First Breadmaker, but I like it.","Ok its hard for me to gauge, since it is my first bread maker. But as a first time user, it works great. I don't know what happened with other owners, but my breadmaker came brand new and was packed well. It was really not too noisy, but what can you expect it needs to knead the dough. Once you drop in your ingredients and set the menu, there is nothing else to do. The smell of fresh bread is incredible. Still tinkering with recipes, but definitely happy with purchase. Would rate 5 stars, but I havent tried other machines so to be fair its got to get 4."
1,No power when plugged in!,"This breadmaker was good for maybe making bread five times. The loaves always looked unsatisfactory. And now that it has set for maybe two months, it worked for one terrible batch of bread before completely not working altogether. It's plugged in and the power button won't turn it on. Don't buy this."
3,Be wary,"This bread machine seems awesome at first. It has many settings and produces a quality, although upright funny shaped, loaf. I received this as a gift at Christmas time in 2008. I make a lot of bread (2 - 3 loaves per week). This product does not hold up well. After not quite one year (December 2009), I wore out the bearings in the first basket. I have now worn out the bearings in basket number two. I wouldn't be quite so bummed except replacing the basket is almost half the expense of the machine itself. For what is purported as an excellent, high quality machine, I expected to get more use out of it."
2,Computer is defective in Breadman machines,"I received my Breadman, used the setting to burn off the oils as per the instructions. That went well. Went to use it to make whole wheat bread (with all ingredients in bread pan)...and nothing. Threw out the ingredients. Not happy.I called the company and was told to hold down the stop/start button to clear the computer, then wait 24(!!) hours and see if it would work. It did not. When I was talking to the company rep I was told that this model has a problem with the computer in them. Also was told they had none on hand to send me a replacement.1. Why 24 hours for it to reset??2. Why no machines in stock to replace defective ones? Or even to sell?3. Why sell machines they know to have problems??I did like the design of this machine so that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of just one.I am going to order another bread machine - but it will *not* be a Breadman."
5,"Good product, but beware of seller...mine was used!","Bought from Amazon and it was used! I returned it and bought it from another website. I'm happy with the item but was really surprized Amazon shipped a used item and sold it for the new price! Luckily, the return was no hassle and I got my money back easily."
5,Great bread machine for gluten-free bread!,"I bought this bread machine recently and have used it a couple times now for gluten-free breads using Pamela's Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix. I love the fact this machine has a gluten-free cycle on it! Made a great loaf of bread!Bread Mix, Amazing, Wheat/Gluten Free, 19 oz."
1,Breadman Ulitmate Pllus,"Don't go there! I got this machine for Christmas. Made about 10 loaves very well. Then the bread pan would not stay put. It wouild ride up on the mixes and the punch down, so no mixing would take palce and the required constant manual holding of the bread pan in place. Zip in the instruction book on this. I called, emailed and write wrote twice only to get from letter that they were going to send a new breadpan, but never did. That was two months ago. I am not an engineer, but the design to hold the breadpan in place looks off. The metal clips will keep the pan from lateral movement, but there is no fastening to keep the pan from vertical movement and rising off of the agitator at the bottom. With this problem in its first year, I'd invest in a more expensive machine, I guess. This one is just sitting on my counter now."
1,"died on second loaf, expect 3 months for replacement",1st loaf was ok but machine began malfunctioning on second loaf. Return to manufacturer was easy but replacement is on back order for 3 months now even though you can still buy it in stock off Salton's website. Customer service has nothing but backorder excuses. I was even told at 2 months that it hasn't been that long (hinting I was complaining for nothing).My biggest mistake was not returning to amazon (I was at 30 day mark and called the manufacturer).1 star for poor manufacturer response.Update....by coincidence I received shipping confirmation the same day I typed the review. Hopefully the machine works well this time.
1,The paint chips off - toxic?,"We bought this breadmaker when we started eating gluten free as it has a gf mode. We have not had any successful loaves that way, both using the recipes that come with the breadmaker nor Bob's Red Mill products. We now use Pamela's bread mix and use the regular cycle, and it works well. More worrying is that the mixing paddle's paint has chipped and I've found chips of paint in the bread. I'm concerned with how much of this we've consumed without noticing. I would never recommend this breadmaker to anyone."
5,Breadman TR875,"Breadman TR875 2-Pound Breadmaker, Stainless SteelGreat product. It is so much more than a bread machine."
1,not user friendly,The plastic measuring cup is more than 1 cup and difficult to reach 1 cup size.It is difficult to pull out the pan after baking.My frist batch is not successful and i will see if it is my fault or the recipe problem.I had Panasonic SD-YD250 which i gave away when i bought this. I miss my panasonic now.
3,Not as good as it looks,IT IS THE GREATEST MACHINE BUT IT DOES NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH. WE BOUGHT IT IN DECEMBER BUT IT IS ALREADY ALL RUSTED INSIDE AND DOES NOT WORK.
4,realllllllllly good bread with one small flaw,"this breadmaker is beautiful and makes bread so yummy that i can't keep up with the demand! the only problem i have found is that when i make a 2 lb. loaf and use the bread flour, it actually makes the loaf so big that it smashes into the lid and the very top doesn't get baked all the way through. if i use all purpose flour that doesn't happen. i'm going to try making a 1 1/2 lb. loaf today. the recipe book is wonderful. i tried the delayed timer the other night and had bread ready right after i dropped my daughter off at school the next morning. how fun!"
4,breadman bread maker,"This Breadmaker was purchased as a christmans gift for my daughter and son in law, who had been diagnosed with celiac diseaseover two years ago. This diagnosis means that he has an allergy to gluten whic is present in all wheat products.This breadmaker has a feature for baking with gluten free flours and has provided them[ASIN:B000FZZ0VE Breadman TR875 2-Pound Breadmaker, Stainless Steel]]the opportunity to have ""bread again"" at a reasonable price with purchasing the special flours in bulk. They love it. I hope to borrow it back this summer and use the jam feature during the berry season."
5,Breadman TR875 2lb Breadmaker Stainless Steel,I bought this for my daughter because she has Celiac Desease.She usesit once a week to make herself a loaf of bead.I also am a Celiac andI am seriously considering buying one for myself as she is so pleasedwith hers.It makes great gluten free bread especially Bob Red MillGluten free bread mix.
4,"Great service, love the breadmaker!","Love the breadmaker, easy to use. It would be better if it can be stopped or paused during the operation, so I give 4 star.Amazon's customer service is excellent, I got a breadmaker with some small flaws and when I contact them, they send me a new one right away, and the new one is perfect!"
4,Good value breadmaker,The TR875 is a modestly priced breadmaker that works well. I've baked a dozen loaves of bread and used the dough cycle (works great for pizza) since I've received this unit a few weeks ago. Every loaf has come out well using the recipes from my favorite bread recipe book-- Electric Bread-- from Innovative Cooking Enterprises. The raisin bread is a favorite and makes great toast and French Toast. The price ($[...] at Amazon.com with free shipping) compares very favorably to all of the other units I previewed prior to my purchase.
4,breadman,"I use my bread machine to make dough. When ready I remove it and bake it myself in the traditional way. When mixing sometimes there will be stuff left in the corners. If I check inside during the mixing phase and scrape the corners this problem can be eliminated- it's just a pain and I don't always remember to do it. It makes great dough, it's easy to use, and is easy to clean. I make all of my own baked goods from scratch. I use my Breadman two or three times per week and could only be happier if it washed itself and put itself away...."
5,AWESOME!!,I bought this for Christmas for my husband and it is perfect!! He uses it about twice a weeks and it turns out great bread every time!! I have no hesitation recommending this breadmaker to anyone!
5,Good machine,"Since it's bought, we use it to bake at least two breads a week. It can also be used to prepare pasta dough. I was thinking to buy a mixer for preparing past douph but now I don't need to. An average mixer costs $200."
1,Junk - save your money,"I purchased this piece of junk through amazon in November 2007. I'm certain I got a brand new unit. I was able to get a few months of baking out of it, and I was very pleased, then the computer started to only work sporadically. Soon after I noticed that the lining was scraping off inside the pan. Well, life got busy and it wound up sitting in the box waiting to be returned which sadly never happened (although after reading the recent reviews here, it seems I may not have been able to get any real service anyway).Now I find myself needing to go gluten free, and thinking, ""I've got a breadmaker with a gluten free option, maybe I can salvage it!"" You can imagine how disappointed I am to learn that I can't get any replacement parts or repairs. Disappointed, and angry with myself for buying it in the first place and not at least attempting a return when I had the chance. For now I'm going to stick to making bread the old fashioned way."
2,Maker Gone South,"Well, it's disappointing that a well thought-out design would have been crafted a bit poorly -sounds like ""American made"". We use it about once a month on average and we enjoyed our Breadman for a couple of years now but it's headed south with a very noisy (95-98 dB)pulley and motor bearing. I looked for parts and no success yet. This machine is without doubt intended to be a disposable unit with about a two year life. Our next purchase will hopefully include alternative machines that have testimonials validating a more robust design. Hope this helps."
3,Worked well while it lasted,"I got this bread machine new for Christmas a year ago. From the get go, it didn't seem to have much kneading power, but it seemed to work well enough to make bread. So, I kept it. Now, a year later, it has died and won't work at all. It probably did have something wrong from the beginning."
2,Breadman Breadmaker,"Stopped working right after a few uses. Does not brown properly and the finished loaf is almost half the size it should be. Tried several different flours, including special bread flour, and still no success."
1,Defective,I received the machine today and suspected it may be refurbished. The plastic cover over the digital readout was missing and the screw on the bottom was totally stripped with scratches on the bottom. I was however willing to give it a chance. I tried to get the bread basket out and it would not come out. I read the manual cover to cover and did exactly what it said. I pulled firmly on the handle. I tried for 30 minutes. It would not come out. I sent it back. I will not order another one.
5,Trouble free,"This is my second bread machine and, so far, seems to be the best. The controls are easy to understand and function exactly as stated. To date I have made regular and specialty bread plus dough for dinner rolls. After using nearly fifty pounds flour I have not had a single failure. Knowing how to make bread by hand could have something to do with my success rate as I do tweak the recipes to my liking. Waking up to the smell of fresh baked bread every day has become the ""norm"" at my house!"
1,bad electronics,"Used this machine about 4 times with great results. Used mixes from the grocery store and recipes from the manual. Then it started to beep too early and shut itself off. I could no longer trust the buttons or settings. It's like it has a bad computer chip or whatever. I'm currently looking at replacing it with a Panasonic, because we all thought it was fun to make our own bread. Too bad it cost us about $25 per loaf! I won't be buying another Breadman."
1,No Longer Making Replacement Paddles,"Sunbeam Oster Breadmaker Paddle 108962-000-000If you're set on buying this machine, buy three or four of the replacement paddles linked above.I hate to do this, because this has been a very good breadmaker, but the difficulty ordering a replacement paddle has completely killed my brand loyalty. Customer service has been awful, and when you lose your paddle (you WILL lose your paddle), after being given the runaround for a few weeks (months, years), you'll finally get an answer from Salton: they no longer make replacement paddles for this model! GREAT.I'd give it four stars for making bread, and five stars for the price-- but the mess with the paddles is just inexcusable and absurd. This is the Windows ME of bread machines: obsolete before it's even out of the box."
5,Best for gluten free bread,"I love this bread machine. I bought it a year ago and have used it on a regular basis (about once a week). It makes great gluten free bread, and the cycle is only 1 hour, 17 minutes long! So a year later I find myself ordering this machine again because the kneading paddle became damaged (scoured, taking the teflon off - a big no-no!). I can't find the kneading paddle or loaf pan replacements, I have to order another new machine. I guess that's okay - if one machine craps out I'll have the other in reserve. Again - no problems with this machine in a year of use. My MIL has one too and she has had no problems. Occasionally the screen will read ""error"" but if you unplug it, wait a minute, then plug it back in it's fine.I also tried out the Cusinart Convection bread machine and didn't like it at all. The Breadman does much better, the loaf rises higher, the texture is better and the cycle is shorter. I'm off to purchase this machine again now!"
4,good product for preparing dough,"I got one when on sale($40). I only use it to make dough. It works great for mixing and kneading but the rising procedure makes the top of the dough a little bit dry. I don't have other breadmaker to compare with. For the price I paid it is a great deal. If it cost $80 or more, then I would not buy it."
3,New Breadmaker and a new Baker,"I bought this breadmaker a year ago and found that it made the bread okay but I had to try to turn it on several times because the menu was so complicated. Also, the mixing function on my breadmaker does not work. I have to start the churning process myself to make sure it works. I wish I had better success with it because I wanted to make my own bread each week with my new machine but as it is I have only used it a couple of times because it does not work."
5,Best Bread ever!!!,I purchased this Breadman machine last spring on sale and its worth every penny!!!!! Our family has loved each loaf and the fresh bread smell wafting thru the house. I have been able to time the loaves to be ready at breakfast if they have appropriate ingrediants...Its really so simple t6 use and a delight..I did try some of the mixes but much prefer the scrtch breads...I bought the Bread Machine cookbook to go along with this and its been heavenly. I had no trouble at all with the machine...The paddle does have to be soked off of the pan but only for a few minuts and cleanup is a breeze...It really looks sharp on my counter as well...Did not use it much over the summer but now that cool weather is here I use it a few times a week.
5,Love it!,"I ordered this breadman after the motor in my old one finally gave up after many years. I love the design of this one. My old one had a vertical pan, and this one is horizontal. The pan is also made of a material which is a lot lighter than the old one. The window is a great size and I can see into it very clearly, unlike my old one. Love the stainless steel- it even looks pretty. I've made many doughs already: for garlic knots, pretzels, bagels, french bread... everything came out great. I even made strawberry jam which came out well. I actually haven't baked in it yet. But soon. Great machine: very happy!"
5,solid,"This has been impressive as my first bread machine. Things always come out well, even when I was using it at high altitude. I just change recipes on a whim and results still come out amazing despite warnings that one might see about careless measuring or alterations. It is easy to clean, use, etc."
2,Very touchy & goes berserk often,"The third time I used my new bread machine the display started going crazy - the timer was speeding, the buttons wouldn't let me choose from the menu, & it started on its own, thus ruining the loaf of bread, since it wasn't supposed to mix yet. I think that one of the buttons was installed improperly, causing it to go haywire. What I have to do before every use is plug & unplug it up to 4 times, and make sure it accepts my input before inserting the bread pan. It works fine after that.Had I known this would happen I would have kept my much cheaper Sunbeam bread machine - it has lower ratings & didn't work well for me, simply because it came with bad recipes. I advise getting a cheaper model & a good bread machine cookbook."
3,Breadman TR875,"Bread machine came without a paddle, instructions and recipe bookCalled Salton hotline they were accomodating, they sent the paddle but only copies of instructions. Item was purchased as a gift. I was disappointed when I received the phone call about the missing parts."
1,don't buy it,"It may show 5 stars above but it is really -1 star.I gave a good review when I first bought and used it. I used it maybe a dozen times in the 3 years that I had it and when I went to use it a few weeks ago, with everything in the pan and ready to go, I plugged in the breadman breadmaker TR875 and nothing---not a beep. So that is history and I have bought a new one, a different brand. I could get no help from customer service as to the problem and when I sent an email, it came back undeliverable."
3,The good news and the bad news,"I purchased this bread machine because it has a gluten free setting. On the plus side, this machine offers a relatively short bread making cycle, a rectangular loaf, settings for light, medium, or dark crusts, easy cleaning, and, of course, the gluten free cycle.The ""bad news"" is that I find when I try to make high fiber gluten free bread, it doesn't seem to cook all the way through, also, if you leave it in the machine too long after it has finished baking it tends to fall. So it really needs to be watched and removed fairly promptly which takes away from the convenience of bread making by machine. It needs more ""tweaking"" for doneness, the manual recommends using the medium setting, but I'm going to try the dark to see if it improves the end product. All in all, it's an OK product."
5,Looks ugly but taste good.,"I just moved from France to live in the US, and I was really missing fresh bread every morning. This machine is awesome, just folow the instructions, set the timer and you will be woken up by the smell of fresh bread."
4,all right except for the manual,"I am over-all satisfied with this machine. It is very convenient for bread making, easy to use. The complain is about the manual. The only useful information there is add milk first. If I fully followed the manual to make bread, I would return it since I thought it is a waste of materials. Be aware of the recipe."
3,The aluminum bucket breaks.,"After a few years of use, maybe 3 yrs, the bucket broke at the bottom next to the blending axle."
2,Another one with Skunk smell,"i'm sure the bread machine makes fine bread, but it's smelled like a skunk since day 1.if you're like me or my wife, and take ages to call up customer service watch out. we called after more than a year, and they said they wouldn't do a thing about it. they didn't even have any suggestions about taking the skunk smell out.wonder if it was a particular batch of machines (or machine part)that a skunk sprayed. i mean, how do you reproduce a skunk's smell so perfectly in a bread machine??"
1,Broken right out of the box,"We were excited to receive this breadmaker. It was our first ever breadmaker. But to our dismay, it was broken before we began. The kneading paddle didn't work. We are returning it for another one. Hopefully, we'll have a better luck next time."
2,Noisey,"We are really disapointed with this bread maker. It is so noisey and we don't like the size of the loaf of bread. Frankly, we went back to our old one until we can find one we like. We will be sending it back."
1,Breadman is refurbished!!!,"I read the reviews about the people who got refurbs. But I bought it anyway, thinking I am paying over $100 for this item, surely mine wont be refurbished. Well got it today and guess what!? IT IS REFURBISHED! No plastic coating on the control panels, and the box was all torn on the edges. So I will be sending this back, I'm not paying over$100 for a refurbished bread machine. Very disappointing!!!"
4,Excellent Machine for the Money,"I bought this for my wife last fall. Unfortunately, one of the buttons on the front didn't work. When I went to return/replace, it was out of stock. We waited, and eventually, they did get more. Despite our 1st experience, we ordered another, and it seems to be fine. Build quality is kind of cheap, but not out of line with the price. My wife grew up baking bread, and is very pleased with the results she gets from this machine. I would certainly recommend."
4,Your black friday deal is higher then before black friday BOO,"I agree with Sue, I was ready to buy the Breadman TR875 2-Pound Breadmaker, Stainless Steel on 11/26/08 but waited till black friday only to find it $20.00 higher. I would have still brought at $79.00 today but I will not buy it at the new price from Amazon. I have owned a Breadman TR875 for a year and half and used it every week to make bread. It was great machine until the pan needing paddle froze up, I check on a replacement part and it was over $40.00 and not in stock. I tried a another brand from Wal-Mart but return it after two bad loaves of breads. I believed I found the Breadman TR875 else wheres on the internet for $79.00, I will try that site again. I am sorry to say that Amazon stock has went down in my eyes. I am 69 year male and this type of marketing does not impress me."
5,Waaaay too funny,"If you are a cat person, you will love this book! I bought this for my son's 9th birthday, and the kids at the party about tore the book apart -- everyone wanted to read it (and to be the deliverer of ""Hey, Mom, look at this!) while they crumbled in hysterics.It is very, very funny. But only if you are a cat person!"
3,A few pieces of gold...,"All in all this was a somewhat boring book but there were a few ""pieces of gold"" scattered amongst the gravel-stones. I guess the book was not quite what I was expecting."
4,Witty,"Amusing little book for cat lovers and the rest of the world... Lots of simple laughs, that's great. I bought several for friends and they loved it too."
5,Great Gift Book for Cat Lovers,"I purchased this book as a gift for a co-worker. While I am not a cat person, she is, so this was a well received gift. I browsed it before wrapping and it is cute and clever. As the title says, you get 244 photos of cats in unusual situations or with crazy expressions and a clever caption below. If you are a cat lover, I think this will please you. As a gift for cat lovers, I don't think you can go wrong."
5,Funny and Original,"Funny! Funny! Funny!,could not stop laughing,in fact as you get ""into"" the book you laugh more as you read on..A great gift!"
4,OH MY GOD YOU WILL DIE FROM THE CUTE!!!!,"Every cat in here has cat-itude (which is like attitude but for cats). Bad Cat: 244 Not-So-Pretty Kitties and Cats Gone Bad has something for every cat lover. It will have you laughing and rolling on the floor. A relatively small book but worth EVERY penny you pay for it... it is a MUST have for all cat lovers, like me!!!!"
1,Cute pictures but not a children's book,"The pictures were good, but I was disappointed by the crude humor with references to drug use, sex and some foul language. Definitely not for kids. I was going to give it to my son, but, well, no..."
2,I didn't know they made books that small,"I love the content of this book but was very disappointed with the size. Although it does state that it's a paperback, it appears to be one of those larger sized paperbacks from the picture and from the price as well. If you look up other paperback books, they appear very small on the view page, as you'd expect a paperback. I was shocked at how tiny this book was and the size makes it difficult to enjoy."
1,Never received it,I have never received this item.I ordered so long ago that only receiving this email did I realise that it had never arrived.It was to be a present for my son for Christmas.Where is it now?
2,Bad Cat Selections for Calendar,"The [...] website has such wonderful and funny cat photos. I added my cats to the site when it first got started several years ago. However, the selections used on the calendar are boring and unoriginal. I got bored after flicking through the first month's worth of photos. I bought the calendar for myself, but plan on giving it away as a Christmas gift instead."
1,Foul and disgusting,Poor quality photographs with very ordinary cat settings aren't the biggest letdown of this book. The book isn't funny. The authors failed attempts at humor reveal a person who doesn't understand the feline mystic. Unlike cats... this book is foul and disgusting.
5,Edgar is quirky hilarious,"I'm not sure non-cat owners or people who are not familiar with the daily goings-on of a cat. Otherwise, get ready to be tickled pink.Bad Cat is a Big Hit! And Edgar doesn't own cats!!!!"
4,If you Love Cats:,"This is one of the funniest ""Cat"" books I have had the pleasure to read. It is clever, hilarious, and fresh. There is no such thing as a ""Bad Cat,"" only misunderstood cats."
2,"Some of the material is ""adult"" in other words in poor taste and or raunchy",Wish I had been warned a little more. NOT family friendly....Be warned if you have kids or loved ones who offend easily.
4,"Great pics, but hokey dialogue at times.","Many of the pictures are hilarious, but some of the commentary is inane and hokey. I pretty much read the whole thing in a bookstore. I would appreciate this book as a gift, but just couldn't bring myself to buy the book myself; there's a little too much cheese."
5,A good laugh,"I bought this for my mom for her birthday on a whim. I'm glad I did. She and my dad both got a really big laugh out of the pictures in this book. When we visited them last week, we all looked at the book, and everyone in my family, from my husband and myself, to each of our three kids, loved this book. We laughed so hard at the captions to the pictures and spent a long time theorizing how they got these cats to pose as they were. It was good for a few hours of entertainment, and even now, a week later, I'm still giggling over some of them. Highly recommended."
4,"The ""Cat Files""","""bad cat"" proposes that cats not only have the mindful abillity to control humans, but that they only pretend to be our friends. They, in fact, own us and have secret thoughts and urges. This book is chalked full of photographs of cats- 244 to be exact. These photos are not for kids. They show cats ""gone wild"" in various candid poses featuring a quote revealing insight into the cat's innermost thoughts. Then, in true detective case evidence style, each page reveals the cat's name, age, and hobby. This book is for anyone loving a silly way to look at felines. It's also great if you like a good conspiracy theory, so outrageous, it just might have some truth to it.The Adventures of Roxy and Mozart"
3,Surge Protection for Plasma TV,"I purchased this device to protect my 42"" Panasonic plasma TV and it seems to work fine. You never really know if something like this works, you only really know after it doesn't.Pros:Reasonably priced.Concise, efficient design.Easy to install.Lights confirm when equipment is protected.Cons:It has an in/out coaxial protector (I have cable) but I quit using this whenI noticed that my HD picture was pixelating and I that I wasn't receiving certain channels. I took this device out of the loop by hooking up the coaxial direct and everything returned to normal. I think that this device must degrade the coaxial signal as it passes through.Summary:I bought this device because it was one of the cheapest options, so all things considered, I'm happy with it. It does most of what I purchased it for."
1,Not very sturdy.,First it could not fit thirty pairs of shoes and it broke within a month. The plastic kept breaking in multiple places.
2,"Good idea, cheaply made","If you're tired of over-the-door canvas shoe holders that warp and bang the door when you open/close it, and want to make the most of your floor space, this design is what you're looking for. We've had ours for a while and still use it. That said, the plastic mortise-and-tenon joints have nearly all broken on ours (the tenon breaks off inside the mortise), and it has fallen over more than a few times, and only stands straight if supported. It can hold 30 ladies shoes if you store them somewhat creatively (e.g., forward-backward). Bottom line is that we'd replace it with something more robust in a heartbeat if we could find a better version, well priced."
1,Don't buy this shoe rack,"With this shoe rack, the problems started right out of the box. Assembly was supposed to involve simply snapping the pieces into place, but everything is so poorly fitted that it required getting a hammer and beating them into place. About one week after being assembled, the plastic structure of the rack began physically bending and sank down at an angle. After approximately 3 months, the entire thing collapsed, sending shoes everywhere. Absolutely do not buy this product ever. I am amazed that this product is allowed to be sold."
4,Useful,"If you don't want to spend the money to get your closet customized with a shoe rack, this one works just fine. It is a tiny bit wobbly with my husbands big shoes on the top racks, but I never feel that it is going to come apart or fall over. Very functional."
5,THE BEST OF TOM SCOTT,"I recently heard this when I was 13 or 14 at the time when this came out. I was in a band one time in middle school where I play the trumpet. Even now I still play it to this day, I know that I'm a huge fan to jazz. Yeah my man Tom Scott is real kickin' on this one. He sounds foremost like my man whom I call my favorite to date is Mr. Richard Elliott.This is sure is killin'. I look forward of buying when I get me a job and make me some money. Big up to Tom Scott 4 putting out much work."
3,It's fun & has plenty actions. Good Film but poor Blu-ray transfer!,"I really enjoy Jet Li's performance in this film. Lots of laughing & action moments. Unfortunately, as the other reviewer points out the BD transfer is quite bad. The film is soft & has plenty grains. If you already own the DVD copy, probably you can do away without this copy. PQ is slightly better than DVD only but for those with big projector screen (mine is 110"") it's a pain in the eyes to watch this film.Though the English audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1, I'm very disappointed with the original Cantonese audio that comes in Dolby Digital 2.0 only. This is really sloppy work.Hopefully in future the studio can improve & do a re-master copy that give justice to this film.Film: 4-starVideo Quality: 2.5-starAudio Quality: 2-starOverall: 3-star"
3,Fong Sai Yuk vs. The Legend,"I've seen both the subtitled Fong Sai Yuk and english dubbed The Legend on DVD. The movie itself is fun and exciting with plenty of great action. Being a Jet Li fan, I found the subtitled version much better than the dubbed only because the dubbed version left out or changed much of what was said and done in the subtitled version. For example, in the subtitled version there was a funny reference to Jet's Once Upon a Time In China films, while in the dubbed version it was completely left out. The only problem with the subtitled version was that the subtitles tended to dip into the bottom of the screen in the beginning of the movie. If you can get a hold of the subtitled version, it's definitely worth watching."
4,Quality martial arts comedy,There are some great fights in this funny & exciting film. Some of the setpieces are amazingly well done & it's very good entertainment.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
3,Decent,"This movie definitely wasn't for me, I like dark movies the most, but like the occasional comedy too. This one wasn't funny enough too keep my interest. The dubbing really ruins this, but it's not quite on the badness level of Twin Warriors. The movie itself is a pretty lighthearted adventure.If you wanna see Jet in a Jackie Chan role, than this is for you.Also----------------------my pick for Fong Sai Yuk is Ho Hsoua(Md Monkey Kung fu) His performance in disciples of master Killer really stole the show for me, also it's a much better overall movie, so I would suggest disciples for anyone who like this."
1,One of the absolute worst dvd releases i've encountered.,"This movie is awesome.Now that i've gotten that out of the way, the reason for such a low rating (if only there were negative stars) is the ... quality of the DVD release. Dimension Home Video, even after paying the license for this movie, senselessly doesn't include the original soundtracks (cantonnese or mandarin), opting for a POS english dub whose translation sounds more like something from an afternoon cartoon than a very very good movie. Although the video quality is fine, it completely baffles me why they didn't include the original languages.PS. I could swear some scenes are missing from the original version."
5,Great from start to finish,"Funny as all get out with the action to match. Starts light hearted, but when Sai-Yuk suffers a tragedy, you feel the rage and vengeance spilling forth from Jet Li. Great bad guy, and the mother is side splittingly funny. Great film. ...."
1,It's dubbed in English!,"The quality of the picture is great, but the quality of the translation from the original is terrible (this is in addition to the awful new soundtrack)."
4,Great Movie...,Legend is a GREAT cult classic. Tom Cruise is awesome as the lead character and Tim Curry is excellent as The Lord of Terror himself. This movie is basically about 2 unicorns that are left in the world and humans are not supposed to see them. Tom Cruise's character (an elf or something) shows them to this human girl and it turns the world upside-down. To correct this Tom Cruise must save the unicorn's lives from Satan.
1,Do not buy this... dubbed and cut garbage.,"This is a great movie starring Jet Li (or Li Lian-Jie in his native Mandarin) and Josephine Siao (Siao Fong-Fong) but this ... version of the movie has been poorly dubbed losing some great acting and comedy and some actual fighting has even been cut from it. Why I have no idea. Please do yourself a favor and seek out the original version called ""Fong Sai Yuk"". Even if you do not understand Chinese you will understand the story well enough from the subtitles and you will enjoy it much better. Trust me on this. Do not encourage [the film industry]in their butchering of quality movies. The original version of this movie is a wonderful mix of action and comedy which I would rate 5 stars...."
1,Original is better~!,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap ""American version"" then~! LOL"
2,Get the subtitled version Fong Sai Yuk,"I love the movie Fong Sai Yuk (subtitled version)! I bought The Legend (dubbed version), so that I can enjoy the movie without being busy reading all the subtitles. That was a BIG mistake.In The Legend, they had cut out some scenes and changed the dialogue. With those changes, the mood of the film has changed and you don't see the development of each character. That's why the story doesn't quite make sense or seem to flow entirely together. The Chinese culture and their beliefs (buddhism) is ""taken out."" The movie is actually more hilarious in Fong Sai Yuk.Don't be left in the dark. A little reading in Fong Sai Yuk won't hurt. You'll enjoy this comedy, action film. I give Fong Sai Yuk 5 stars. As for The Legend...=("
1,Another Subpar Blu-Ray Release from Dragon Dynasty!,"Maybe i'm missing something but just like Tai Chi Master there really is no discernible improvement in the picture quality from the blu-ray compared to the dvd. This is honestly a waste of money if you already own the dvd; the up convert of the dvd looks as good as the blu-ray. I see a possible trend with Dragon Dynasty similar to what happened with the advent of dvd's: initially put out a shoddy copy on blu-ray, then follow-up with a remastered, true high definition version and in the process screw the consumer into buying the new and improved version."
1,Great movie ...,... ruined by bad dubbing. Unfortunately there is there is nothing in the Amazon listing or even on the DVD case indicating that this is dubbed. A nasty trick to play on buyers who prefer the original language.
5,Fong Sai Yuk: A True Masterpiece,"This movie is definetly one of the best that I've ever seen. The thing that makes it so great is the clever screenplay and the combination of action, comedy, romance, drama, and historical content. Jet Li's amazing wu-shu martial arts skills are truly worth seeing. The only way for this movie to be better for the American is if you know the Chinese Language, and believe me, this movie is worth learning a language for. Fong Shi Yu, (As Fong Sai Yuk is known to Mandarin Speakers), is definetly one of Jet Li's best movies filmed during his prime. I also recommend ""Once upon a Time in China"" I, II, and III, and Fong Sai Yuk 2."
2,Dimension is killing me,"This senseless dubbing has got to stop. Fans know this film as Fong Sai Yuk. And this, like all Dimension releases, has ONE audio track: a bad English dub that makes every character in the whole movie sound like some fool straight out of a 70's ""chop sockey"" film. What, praytell, is the point of the DVD format when there is no language option? ESPECIALLY when they purge the original preferred subtitled format for a Saturday-morning version that perpetuates the whole badly-synced Asian stereotypes of the past.Just take one look at how many Hong Kong DVDs are imported by Americans each year and TRY to tell me that Americans aren't ready for subtitled films. Look at the success of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. AMERICANS ARE NOT THE CULTURALLY INEPT IGNORAMUSES THEY WERE IN THE 70'S!!!!Though this dumb home video move should not really surprise anyone.... So PLEASE buy this film... via import, from Hong Kong, so you can see it how it was meant to be viewed and heard."
4,Great fighting scenes with mom (the lady is bad),Great comedy and action flick. Fell in love with Jet Li after seeing this movie.
5,Fong Sai Yuk 2,"Sai Yuk returns as the newest member of the Red Flower Society with his godfather Master Chen who is not only the Chief of the Red Flower Society but is also the brother of the Emperor. As Fong Sai Yuk helps the Society get the Sacred box which holds Master Chen's fate, he embarks on a wild journey. His mother returns with him and is still her old crazy self. Jet Li is magnificant in this movie and is in my opinion the best movie he has made next to Tai Chi Master....but that is another review....."
3,"Great start, lost interest at the end","This film had a fast-paced, wild, funny start and I was interested in the comedic storyline. Li and Josephine Siao (playing his mother) make a great duo and I loved seeing them acting together. The fight scenes are great too (but not as good as Once Upon a Time in China). However, the movie than slowed down its perfectly fine pace and then went into dramatic mode, which it promised us it would not go into at the start. I thought Jet lost a little interest too, as he used so much energy in the comedic part of the movie he seemed to run out of steam. The end sequence was a bit too westernised, but the end fight made up for it with some ingenious but short choreography. Jet Li's at his best, sort of unintentionally parodying Jackie Chan's Drunken Master role, and I never knew he had a comic side to him, but the film slows down as it goes along and the main story is uninvolving (the substories are, though)."
3,dynasty edition has scenes cut!,"I was torn on how many stars to rate this. I have loved this movie since I first saw it years ago and is a five star for me. Jet Li's fighting is always great to watch but this role as a charming but rather spoiled boy hero really shows off his comedic acting skills. The Fong family is hilarious and the mom almost steals the show. That said, while this Dynasty version at least has original language with subtitle option (a must for me), it also has some scenes cut which is a major flaw. why??!!"
2,One of Jet LI's worst,Not one of his better films. I thought the movie was garbage. I wish I would not have seen it! Grrr. Godbless~Shauns movie review
2,How do you draw shoujo?,"This book teaches you next to nothing about the Shoujo genre. The art and information in this book varies from pretty good to awful and useless. This is not a beginners book and more advanced artists will not get anything new from this book. The only use I found for it was for costume inspiration.Two stars for effort, zero for quality."
1,AWFUL,This has got to be one of the worst how-to-manga books i have ever read in my life. The art is awfully unprofessional and looks like it has been drawn by a 13 year old. If you want a decent manga book which teaches you how to draw the stuff as well as offering hints and tips look elsewhere.
3,ehh,I book this book as a set with another one thinking i would use it. But after going threw it a few times haven't used it or cracked it open since. It's just about glamorizing you drawings up. Not very informative.
1,This is AWFUL for beginners!,"This books title says ""manga mania shoujo"". 1. The style shown through out the book is not MANGA. There is a difference between MANGA and ANIME styled drawings. 2. Shojo/Shoujo, is the girl romance type stories. This book in no way shows you how to draw in EITHER way. I would not even recommend this to my nephew who is interested in drawing manga/anime.The figures are rigid and childlike. Thick lines and stiff poses. Awful color choices that show no attention to coloring detail which can be important to learning an art form. Manga is also about lines. Line strokes, line weight, emotion and illustration. This book lacks it completely. I would not recommend this at all, beginner or advanced."
5,Awesome,"This book gos over everything you need to know when drawing manga. It goes over hands, facial features, female AND male characters, diffrent hair types, bodys, Chibi, design detail, and a whole lot more. If you dont want to get a million books going into great detail with just one subject, then i suggest you get this book. It really helps with trying to create your own unique manga characters as well. I suggest you go out and get this book as soon as possible."
5,Helpful,"IT SHOULD BE THREE INSTEAD OF FIVE STARS, MY MISTAKE.With everything there are always pros and cons this book is no exception.The pros is that it goes through about every little thing that you can thing of. From facial angles to foreshortening (which I had no idea how to do before I purchased this book. It also helped with shadows and clothing folds.It contains a section on the beloved chibis and it covers male characters. It even had Bishies(beautifully drawn male characters)Some of the art work is great!The cons are that it doesn't go into great detail and a few of the pictures look like they were done by a first grader.All in all I like this book very much and for a 144 pages it's a steal."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND! An absolutely fabulous book!,"This book is by-far one of the greatest shoujo books I've EVER seen! ^_^ If you love shoujo, you'll love this book. It's got it all. Character poses, magical weapons and of course, some of the most BEAUTIFUL costumes I've ever laid-eyes upon! Even if your not a big fan of girly books, there's also some WAY AWESOME battle scenes! So whether you're a long-time shoujo fan, or your just looking for some great fantasy ideas, these books are for you! I STRONGLY recommentd ANY and ALL books written by Christopher Hart. *_* You'll be star struck by this breathtaking book!"
5,Another Five-Star Gift from Michael Pollan,"Michael Pollan--it just occurred to me how close his name is to ""pollen--garners five stars from me for this excellent PBS documentary based on his book, ""Botany of Desire"". This program was produced by Pollan's long-time friend Michael Schwartz, and their collaboration gives us a little work of art that's way greater than the sum of its parts.Congrats to both Michaels. Buy this video and learn its many lessons."
3,It's All Too Predictable,"I was looking through my DVD/Blu Ray collection and saw this movie and remembered enjoying it when I was 10, so I went back and watched it again to see if I still enjoyed the movie as I did when I was younger. I did not. I tried to imagine I was watching the movie for the first time and after the first 15 minutes I could predict the outcome. If you're a parent and tring to get your kids to watch a movie that you'll enjoy as well start looking for a different movie. Kids will enjoy it, but adults will predict it."
3,"Okay information, Amateur Video regarding production","Stick with the book, ""Dr. Denmark Said It."" This video goes through information regarding the importance of a baby's schedule, how to position the baby when sleeping and what to feed up to 2 years. There are several demonstrations like how to blend your baby food and how to make up the crib. It also has some special biographical clips of Dr. Denmark. With a better camera and a just a little more time spent on production, this could have been so much better from a technical aspect. The presenters are good, but good luck trying to get your hubby to sit through this, the music alone is enough to make them walk out. I've passed my copies on to expecting friends with the warning, ""It looks really dated (with the exception of Dr. Denmark's clips which are historical), but the info is good and worth sitting through."""
5,What can I eat that is close to my residence (or hotel)?,"This map is essential to find out what restaurants are nearby. Be it neighborhood, residence, or hotel, or after-theater dining, you can glance at the map and see what establishments are close.If you have detailed questions, it helps to have the accompanying (alphabetical) Zagat Guide handy.Superb for out-of-towners as well as locals. These maps have also been published for San Francisco, and possibly Chicago, but not many others."
4,One of the few sure-fire laughs in print.,"""The World According to Student Bloopers,"" a section of Lederer's book, has been widely pirated on the Internet and is thus familiar to many, even though they may not know its original source. There's a reason why this text has echoed around the world: One cannot read it without laughing. Other sections of the book, all of which deal with the many misuses, distortions and double-entendres encountered in everyday English usage, aren't quite so laugh-packed, but are still well worth the trip."
1,"Probably a great download, but the downloads don't play.","We must be entering the era of streaming and leaving behind downloads for good, because I purchased this, downloaded it, and receive nothing but error messages about it. This is about the fourth or fifth album this has happened with, so I guess there's nothing more to say. I recommend Spotify!"
5,You gonna argue with Miles?!,"Art Blakey, Max Roach, and Miles Davis were all known for working with up-and-comers and setting them to flight when they felt the player could get nothing more from hangin' around...and Mobley flew. ""No Room For Squares"" is one of the many jazz albums that is not just a classic because of its many players (Lee Morgan/Donald Byrd on trumpet; Andrew Hill/Herbie Hancock on piano, and Philly Joe Jones on the drums) but because of the quality and depth of this music. This album isn't ""fun"" like some jazz recordings, it's serious and seriously cool (which can be laughable traits unless you've got the goods). This is the kind of album that sets a connoisseurs collection apart from the average collection of ""classic"" jazz. In the revised liner notes, Bob Blumenthal quips that this album could've been called ""No Room For Improvement"". I can only bow to his superior review and humbly concur."
1,Bum Edition!,"This edition is of very low quality. It appears that someone, perhaps a high school student, has attempted to make a typed copy of the original book, and the publisher had it printed. There is no original publication information or even date, typos abound, some including insertions of words into other words. This is in general a very shoddy piece of work. I bought a few weeks ago on Amazon, and my copy visually resembles that shown here, but publisher is identified differently. Anyway, don't buy it."
2,Goldwater Philosophy,"The Goldwater opinions are overly simplistic. Although as a youth I was a Goldwater Republican, as I grew in age my philosophy changed dramatically. There is a real modern world out there whether Republicans want to believe it or not."
2,Conscience of a Conservative,"I was very discusted with the book itself. This is not an original but a copy made and very poorly bound duplicate. It was sold as a used copy but this did not mean a duplicate copy. This was a new copy. The price was high for a duplicate. It missed all normal identification of publisher etc that would be carried in an original. The content is that of the Goldwater, not great, but what I wanted. I really should have returned the copy because it was not as advertised. The original should really be in historical class and currently is not easy to find in many public libraries."
4,The Essense Revisited,This is a great statement of true Conservatism. What was the point of an afterword by a Socialist Loser. That's the only reason I didn't rate this a 5 star. I would buy an earlier edition if I had it to do over again.
5,An awesome guide for the politically perplexed,A superb randition of lucid thought with a timless message applicable to current events and times.
5,Do not forget,"The conservative movement of today; is corrupted. The unseen forces of Stalin and Kruschev have given a corrupting and truly racist tone. Barry would be shocked at the lack of respect and the marxist undertones of Walker, LePage, and Perry."
5,American Conservatism,"One of the best books I have ever read portraying the deep rooted values of our country and the need to protect the American way of life. Mr. Goldwater did an excellent job laying out the basis for his viewpoints. You can get a clear understanding of how the conservative movement would pick up momentum and set the stage for Ronald Reagan's presidency and success. Clearly, the values are timeless.The book is an easy read but deep enough to be thought provoking in almost every chapter. It was amazing to see 90% of the Author's examples are still issues we are wrestling with today.Great addition for your personal library.On a side note; I gained a better opinion of Pat Buchannon with his opening remarks in this reprint."
3,Perhaps not the best conservative thinking.,"After reading Goldwater's view, I feel that perhaps I am not as conservative as I thought. Goldwater was a principled man who voted his conscience even though it hurt politically. After reading this book, I came to disagree with him on some things. First, education of a young adult may be up to the state, but as the southern states were doing in the sixties and seventies, it was not fair to segregate and then make unequal educational facilities available to each group. I thought his views on negotiating with the Soviet Union also very extreme. He was for confrontation which might have resulted in a nuclear holocaust.This is an OK read on the conservative political agenda. I don't agree with all the points, and think it extreme in some cases. However Goldwater made his point as a political opponent of liberalism."
5,Barry Goldwater's Conscience of a Conservative is Excellent Reading,"Barry Goldwater's ""The Conscience of a Conservative"" provides a great insight into the person of Barry Goldwater, and brilliantly explains the mind and logic of the conservative. This book was written in the 1960's; many of the problems that we are seeing today were in their beginning stages when this book was written. Barry warned us of the ramifications of a country which vests too much power into the federal government, and which abandons its constitutional roots. The book is an excellent read to understand conservatives."
3,Undergraduate-level text? I think not!,"The writing was, unfortunately, much more abstruse than expected since it is touted as a text for undergraduate OR graduate level studies. While it does provide a lot of information, it leaves much to be desired (especially considering the price). Even at the graduate level, the writing is difficult to understand and makes a lot of assumptions about the reader's initial knowledge of the subject."
5,Couldn't put the book down!,"From cover to cover, a delightful, entertaining, funny and well written book! Every dreamer in the world will find a part of themselves in Dori DeCamillis' descriptions of the people they met, the places they went and the desperation and triumphs of their years on the road, living a dream. Not since Peter Jenkins' ""A Walk Across America"" has an author so clearly depicted heart and soul to the reader, both the joys of success and the sadness of defeat.I took the book with me to the Doctor's office and never noticed that I'd waited over 40 minutes . . . read until the wee hours of the morning . . . and got snowed in at my mother's house for two days where I finished the book.I teach business and marketing clinics specfically for artists and have a recommended reading list. ""The Freeway"" will go right alongside Julia Cameron's ""The Artist's Way"". Its a delightful tour into the realities of being an artist."
2,Nice pictures...but,"I would like to let potential buyers know that if you are not a complete beginner then this book may not be very useful to you. The book is very attractive and looks nice on my shelf, but the information is very basic. Also, the index and plant directory offer latin names only (with no cross-reference to common names), which is useless if you don't have a degree in botony. If you did know all of the latin names, you probably wouldn't need such basic information..."
3,Read Me,"The movie was okay. If you like The Nutty Professor and Martin you'll like this movie. When this chick's ex exscapes from prison, she moves right away to Big Momma's house, little does she know Big Momma is out of town and has been replaced with an undercover trying to get the scoop on her. The DVD contains special features such as making of the movie, deleted scenes, bloopers, and music videos."
5,Very funny,"This is a very funny movie.My ribs hurt so much because I was laughing so hard, when I watched it."
3,OK,It's an ok movie. My grandson really likes it and wanted to see it. I personally don't care for several parts of it.
4,good movie,Wife never seen the movie so had to get it so she could see it for the first time.She loved it as do I.Always funny to watch it.
5,HILARIOUS!,"""Big Momma's House"" has got to be one of the funniest movies of the year. Even though the critics gave it 1 1/2 stars or something, the critics only like Julia Roberts and Gwyenth Paltrow movies! Martin Lawrence is excellent as Big Momma! Nia Long is great in this movie. I reccomend it to someone who understands ""black humor"". Great, great movie!"
3,Another Tootsie Rip-Off is OK,"Here we have yet another rip-off of Tootsie, this one comes in OK. This time we have Martin Lawrence as an FBI Agent posing as an overweight lady trying to solve the mystery of a young girl's involvement with a crime. Some good laughs, but doesn't come close to Mrs. Doubtfire or Tootsie. I was expecting the DVD to only have a trailer or something, but to my surprise the DVD has some good features. They include: deleted scenes with commentary, outtakes and bloopers, a documentary, feature-length director/producer commentary, 2 music videos, a makeup test, and some trailers and TV spots. If you like the Tootsie rip-offs, then you should like this movie, but if you don't dig it, stick with Mrs. Doubtfire."
4,"A new spin on ""man as woman"" movie...",This movie is a pretty good movie with great characters. Martin Lawrence does a good job as two characters and being funny. Camera work is great as is editing. The only bad part is a few plot holes at the end. It's nice that about 15 minutes of the movie takes place in a church since you don't really see that often these days...
2,Uninspired Comedy,"This movie is only for die hard Martin Lawrence fans. Essentially, the film takes a familiar gimmick (man in drag trying to impress a woman) and brings little imagination to it. Practically every scene looks like it was taken from another movie. Sure Nia Long is cute (she looks great in a negligee), but that alone is not justification to see this movie. The jokes you've probably seen before (and done better). Toward the end, Martin Lawrence seems bored and so will you.If you like the concept, go see SOME LIKE IT HOT, MRS. DOUBTFIRE or TOOTSIE instead. All three are much better movies. Simply put, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE plays like a bad ""Martin"" episode."
4,Big Comedy,"This is a entertaining movie if you ask me. I enjoyed this, It funny and the story is good. Martin knows comedy! Black mrs doubtfire lol"
1,Stop the torture!,"All I can say is that if you ever get to see this movie, DON'T! It was the biggest waste of film of the year 2000 (besides BattleField Earth). Only people who find stupid white people and a guy dressing as a fat woman funny should watch this movie. If you get the chance to see it, run away, and never look back."
3,Same ole Same ole,"Well I thought that this movie was going to be the bomb because it had Martin the comedian of all comedians. However once reviewing it I was a little disappointed because it was like I had heard most of the jokes in previous movies, so I really felt like I knew what was coming next. I do believe that ole Martin needs to get some more jokes before he makes another movie."
3,3 1/2 STARS I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER,"I did enjoy this but it isnt the best movie ever.It isnt martin's bets movie as well! But it is a MUST WATCH, but not a MUST BUY.I did get a few laughs out of it but when i went to the movies i really did expect a bit more.I think it is more of a kids movie!It is a bit far fetched at some points.But overall worth a look and i recomend you hire it before you buy also i would like to say check out Blue Streak and my favourite martn lawrence film and probably one my favourite movies of all time Nothing To Lose.Martin is hilarious in that one!"
1,Another Mrs. Doubtfire,"big momma's house is exactly the same as mrs. doubtfire and neither of them are funny. if he wants to dress up like a woman, then that's his business. same old jokes. your face is falling off, oh my god she knows I am not who she thought I was now. I saw nothing funny here. especially at the end there is a scene with a church and singing amazing grace. they don't even attempt any jokes. really can't think of a thing that's even remotely entertaining in this. i'd call it a dissapointment but it didn't have any high expectations."
1,If you are not a HUGE Martin Lawrence fan put this one back.,"Fortunately for me, I waited til this total waste of film, and time on my part, was on video before viewing. I am not even a fan of Martin Lawrence. I did like Blue Streak, but only because the charming Luke Wilson was in it. I don't think Lawrence has alot of comedic talent. I have to admit there are a few, very few rare momments of Martin Lawrence that I actually consider funny. And maybe one of them was in this film. Blue Streak was a much better movie and story. I am a fan of some of the older, much more funny comedies that involve men dressing up like women for whatever reason. SOME LIKE IT HOT & TOOTSIE are probably the best of the bunch. Plus, how many times can bathroom humor be funny? It's getting old. This waste of time has maybe two or three funny parts, and the rest is just totally stupid. The ending was totally predictable. I think that Martin Lawrence should maybe hangup his fat suit and go back to t.v."
1,Much as I love comedies,"Running out of comedies to watch, I finally rented this one. I might as well not have. Martin Lawrence is like Eddy Murphy, only without the talent and the good looks. And the rest of the movie is thereafter."
4,"Cheesy rip-off of Mrs. Doubtfire, but good cheese.","A lot of the events in this movie are *strangely* similar to some events in Mrs. Doubtfire, and, like I stated, this IS a cheesy rip-off, but good cheese, like American. No swiss. I got this on DVD for christmas, and it is hilarious. Lawrence is fabulous and fuuuunny. Great movie to just sit back and laugh at. Get it. what are you waiting for???!?!????"
3,"It was predictable, silly, but still funny.","I thought the movie would be better than it was, but I can't say I was totally disappointed with it. It had some funny parts, and although the plot was very predictable (you almost always knew what was going to happen next.) It was still entertaining and I'm glad I watched it.If you're looking for non-stop laughs, look elseware. But if you don't mind some sillyness and just want to have fun, this is right movie."
2,Dull and Lame. A Sheer Dissapointment.,"My Opinion: When I saw this movie, I had high hopes thinking that it would be funny. Boy was I ever mistaken! This is probably the worst movie of the year. Scored big with teens though because it has what they love --- Lowbrow jokes! What a waste of film.The Short and Sweet: To make a bust, an FBI agent poses as a 300-pound grandmother.The Players: Martin Lawrence, Nia LongThe DVD: Not bad. Somewhat deserves Special Edition Label."
2,A Torturous Attempt at Cross-Dressing Comedy.,"Again, Martin Lawrence proves himself a Poor Man's Eddie Murphy with this Witless Effort. A Lame Script, Bad Direction and Actors who constantly look like they've just woken up, give this film a very ""Couldn't be Bothered"" feeling.Take a Pinch of ""Mrs Doubtfire"", a Dash of ""Stakeout"" and filter out the Action and Comedy. That'll give a Pretty Good Estimation of the Entertainment in store for the Unlucky Viewer.The One Saving Grace (and the reason for 2 stars instead of 1) is Anthony Anderson, who plays a Wannabe Cop who helps Lawrence out. He makes every piece of Poorly Written Dialogue he has seem like it was written by Neil Simon.Only Die Hard Lawrence fans need apply, anyone not fitting that description should Spend their hard earned money elsewhere."
1,The laughs do not come BIG!,"The problem with this so called ""comedy"" is that we have seen it all before. I mean it's a cross between 'Mrs. Doubtfire' and 'The Nutty Proffesor'. This is such a dull 'comedy' that only raises a few titters. The film is all too clich`e...Cop goes undercover..cop falls for pretty girl...sentimental messages sent etc...YAWN! Martin Lawrence also tries too hard to be the Eddie Murphy character and he tries so hard but it all falls flat in what I could say was the ""WORST COMEDY OF 2000"". The concept has been done before and done much, much better."
1,A waste of time and plastic,Not only is this movie a waste of time but I would go as far as to say the plastic used to make the DVD case could have been put to better use. I laughed only once. The coffee filter breathing mask was the only real laugh I had during the whole movie. What a total waste of time. Martin Lawrence was just not funny. Maybe I missed something but it appears to me that the whole movie was made based on Martin's name and comedic potential. He totally missed the mark.I would reccomend that you rent this movie first but I can't even do that. This is one of those movies that should be totally ignored. Even if you are a Martin Lawrence fan I think you should wait and get this one from the reduced or clearence bin.
3,specialty driver,"Nice Felo finish and feel, but....Bit receiver is shallowDrive may 'spiral out' under torqueGood for tricky fastenings with low torque values"
2,the pendents clump up when worn,"This is a necklace with 3 very tiny pendants, that is not connected to each other. They sort of just clump up and usually you just see the middle in front, blocking the rest.. The pink is not has red as in the pictures, it is more of a very light pink. Only reason I gave it an extra star is because the chain is fairly sturdy."
1,One big knot,"I had purchase this as a gift for my wife on Mother's day. I recieved it in a timely manner. It came in a little bag and when I pulled it out it was in one big knot. I am still trying to this day to get the knot out, which means my wife still has not be able to wear it. I would not recommend this product from this vender until they can ensure it gets to you undamaged."
3,Check if hose fits first ...,"When I first saw this, I'd thought this is the greatest thing. Instead of spending a few dollars each time for a small propane tank that last just a couple of hours, I'd would be able to conect this hose to a large tank and it would last me the whole summer. I'm in the park, got my grill, connect the hose to the grill, and then i'd relized that the hose didnt fit the tank...Lucky for me I still had the small tank. What a disapointment. The next time I refill my tank, I will bring my hose and make sure they give me one that fits the hose. Thought this thing would fit the large propane tank, not true, check 1st ; ("
5,Lighting a conflagration under the university curriculum.,It is difficult to describe this marvelous and passionate exposition on the love of learning. Drives the reader to consider a substantial investment in the Loeb Classic library.
3,"Well, 3.5 stars","Just a couple of thoughts after many long reviews: The prose is too cute and verbose. These are intelligent men, so I assume they picked this style on purpose. Too often I felt they continued to bludgeon a corpse with their gritted-teeth humor.The middle section, about who did the killing of Homer, was not nearly as interesting as the beginning and end (which are more about the Greeks). Write something inciting and enticing and student will come to it, demanding something of value. Whine over your colleagues, and you may drive some away. Pair the two ends together for the general populace, saving the bombast for your silly peers, and would be a worthwhile book.So, do read this book, but don't regret skipping over the answer to the question the title poses."
1,Decline of Culture and Knowledge,"There used to be a time when philologists had an intimate knowledge of world literature. For instance, if you read Erich Auerbach's classic ""Mimesis"" you enjoy the book of an grand old man of letters who like a souvereign displays his careful and passionate readings of the classics, and gives you thoughtful reasons why Homer could not survive. Compared to this grand old tradition Victor Hanson's book is thin-lipped and merely offers cheap polemics. One misses refinement and culture."
4,Important to understand,"It is important for all Americans to understand from which ancient cultures this country was ultimately formed. The government we live under, our way of life, our views about things good and bad were ultimately the result of Greek thinking. Not Chinese, not Persian, but Greek and to some extent Hebrew. In this age history is devalued to the point where it seems we don't even wish to understand our origins. Certainly other cultures have contributed to the American miracle but we MUST understand the Greeks and Romans in order to understand where we have been and where we are going. The picture these two authors paint of the Greeks isn't always a cheery one. They made mistakes, a lot of them, but since our nature was their nature we need to understand them in order to avoid their mistakes. That's really all the authors are saying."
3,Very Small,"Just a word of caution. Though this is a very high quality lens that works well, I was very surprised that the entire thing when opened is about an inch across the length. For me, this was just far too small to be useful."
5,A Must-Read!,"I heard about this book and couldn't wait to pick it up. It really should be required reading for anyone hoping to develop a lasting, loving relationship. For the first time, real life stories of love and loss have been compiled into one, action packed book. This book is so good that you just can't put it down...there really is a story in here for everyone. Ladies, get this book now! The ""Talking Back,"" section features five incredible essays by black men including Kevin Powell and Victor LaValle...the men in this book write openly and honestly and its a great way to find out what Black men are really thinking. I strongly reccommend this book!"
3,no title,"Another tough book, but not as bad as others I've read on the same subject. Not as long either, mercifully. Some insightful stuff here, and great photos. I am beginning to appreciate and even like abstract art."
5,Great mix of funked up tunes,"I picked this album up used for $7.99, and I would have been glad to pay full price for a new copy. It contains some of the best tracks from the funkiest albums in history. I own several of them, but I still bought this one! I can't really say what my favorite track is, but Loose Booty, Cosmic Slop, Hit it and Quit it, and a live version of Maggot Brain make it well worth the price."
5,my review,"On this, the third chapter in the Niccolo series, we fin Nicholas has been ""kidnapped"" by the 'presumptuous' King of Cyprus who is actually trying to recover his kingdom from his sister.Nicholas is able to help the king and at the same time obtain franchises in his dye works and sugar fields. He meets with Katelina, the mother of his only child, only to lose her once more after they reconcile. Finally, once the island is secure to King Zacco, Nicholas is allowed to return to Venice, where he faces once more his rival family, the de St Pol and Riberac.In this chapter of the story the author makes great use of description in her scenes and they are so vivid! the characters, the settings everything is so masterfully blended with reality and fiction.I loved this book and I have already started the fourth chapter. Good!"
5,"Race of Scorpions,Historical Fiction","I cannot say enough about Dorothy Dunnett's Series, THEY LYMOND CHRONICLES AND this one from the series THE HOUSE OF NOCCLO. All the books are great reads and I truly loved this one. I am on THE UNICORN HUNT, now and am enjoying it just as much. I will keep reading until I have finished all her books and then find some other good authors. These are filled with terrific characters that just grab you as well as lots of information from history that I am drinking in."
5,"Adventure, romance and a fascinating world","This book works on so many levels, it's hard to know where to start. On one hand, it's almost formula romance, with the slight twist that it's the boy who gets to be unusually plucky and courageous while his wives-to-be work to rescue him from danger. Oh, right, there's another little twist- Jerin is being wooed by no fewer than five princesses.The story is fast-paced(as all of Wen Spencer's are) and gripping. I too long for a sequel, or better still, a prequel done on the story of Jerin's kidnapped grandfather, Prince Alannon."
4,"Fast, well-written, and fun!","It was a quick read, well-written with a twist that had me intrigued from the blurb. Looking forward to seeing what else the author puts out."
3,disappointing,"I had read the preview on Ms. Spencer's website and was eagerly anticipating this book. She has done such a great job in her other series and stories of creating characters you really enjoy getting to know, and want to read more of. In this story, however, the premise is interesting (in concept) but I went away feeling like I could have changed gendres/names/location and been reading a pretty generic and not very gripping period romance. Not terrible, but nothing great, or even very good."
3,It was OK,"I loved Tinker and the Ukiah series which is why it pains me that I disliked this.I have a hard time reading role reversal stories such as this because no one does them well. There have been societies that were matriarchal and practiced polygamy. Please study them before building your own world with these characteristics. The physiological and psychological differences between men and women do exist, even if they tend to be exaggerated in our media, and they helped created and shape the societies that exist today. This is just something I can not suspend my disbelief with."
2,Much closer to a bodice-ripper than sci-fi/fantasy.,"With 2 simple changes - changing the genders back, and setting the book in, say, the Mideast - this book would be a below average historical romance aimed at the younger reader. It's basically set in the old west, so it doesn't qualify as sci-fi. The only ""fantastic"" premise is that males are biologically rare, and some of the social implications of that, and even those aren't earth shattering. Given the creativity of some of the author's other books, this book is all the more disappointing. One can only hope they don't plan to make this a series."
1,A waste of money,"I didnot think this Feather bed was that great. I heard from some one at work that a feather bed is a must. So i did some research & found this one. It took a week to get here & i was soo excited. But, was i disappointed after trying it out the first time. I fluffed it and layed down & the feathers shifted to the sides..was not comfortable at all. I ended up giving it away after using it for a week. I thought i would give it a try. I am over it. If i were to buy another one i would pay more & actually want to see it in person before i buy it (if i buy another one,which i doubt i would)..I bought a new mattress (temperpedic) which works out just awesome for now. A waste of money."
4,great player with complicated instructions,"i chose this player because of its size and various reviews of its sound quality. it had amazing sound for such a small package. the controls on the device are surprisingly easy to use considering the size of the buttons. one word of warning, the instructions for loading music onto the device are HORRIBLE! i finally found that it was much easier to load music onto it using my windows media player that i already had on my computer. it allows you to sync everything onto the device and will convert any necessary formats for use. i would highly recommend using that instead of the YEPP studio that comes with the device. other than that, it's a great product!"
4,"best MP3 player, but for one fault","This is the only one of four MP3 players i tried that had acceptable sound quality. All the others; Rio, RCA, Nike had a strange high pitched noise no matter what the source of the audio files. The Yepp does not, and the WOW sound is really quite good. The only problem is that no matter how you put songs into thae player, it plays them back in alphabetical order. This drove me crazy. The only solution to this is to put each album(or collection of songs) in its own folder and copy them using windows explorer. Then each folders songs are in order. other than that problem this is the best MP3 player you can get for the money."
4,awesome mp3 player!!!!!!!!!,this mp3 player is great it's small enough to hold in the palm of your hand but not so small that you can't use the buttons. it's easy to put songs from your computer on it and the sound is fantastic. it doesn't hold is many songs as i thought it would but it holds plenty. i def. think that this is one of the best buys for your money if you are looking for a good mp3 player!!
2,Simple yet effective. No Mac compatibility.,"This is a great simple mp3 player. It does what it says and does it pretty well. However, it is not seen as a hot pluggable flash drive and requires Samsung's proprietary software.As such, it does not work on the Mac or Linux. In order to use it, I have to fire up my PC, copy mp3's from my Mac to my PC, and then to the Yepp. Samsung has also recently dropped support for their printers on Mac, too. Sad, because they make some great products."
5,Handbook of Separation Techniques for Chemical Engineers.,"This book is an comprehensive encyclopedia of elementary and advanced seperation techniques. This can be used as a Professional Standard Reference for the R&D Engineers,Design Engineers Operating Personal etc...This can be used as a reference book for Graduate Students working Seperation Technology area."
5,Seigmen,"This is the best goth rock album I've ever heard. This album is relaxing, very powerful, and musically complex. This, in my opinion, is the best seigmen album. If you're looking for something new and good, this is the perfect album to buy. Another album worth buying is Total. It's heavier than Metropolis and not as poppy. Most of the songs off Total sound very similar, but it's still a good album. I don't recommend many of Seigmen's albums other than Total and Metropolis."
4,Bloodlines a winner,Mountford's prose sets vivid scenes and her historical research on the ponies is evident. She skillfully weaves history and modern-day questions to give us a mystery that keeps us reading and is not soon forgotten.
1,Don't buy garbage!!,"Save your money because you will have to haul this thing to the dump in two years. We bought one three years ago and loved it all summer. The next summer, though, the coating started to flake off of the cooking grate. We called the Customer Service line and they sent us another grate. So we had another great summer. But guess what? This summer, the same thing is happening, only now they're telling me (at CharBroil.com's customer service line) that they won't replace the grate because the grill is out of warranty. Never mind that the grate is only a year old, they were surly, rude, and generally abusive both times I called. They should be ashamed to be producing and selling such a cheap and horrible product. And now, the plastic that surrounds the ice chest is cracking so the yellow insulation shows through. And we can't see through the window to tell if it's lighted anymore.Horrible, horrible product. JUNK."
4,Tutu is the Real Deal!,"Tutu Jones is an outstanding blues guitarist that has been sadly overlooked by many in their search for more trendy material from blues tots from the burbs. Amazingly, Tutu has four outstanding releases and every one of them is now out of print. On this disc, Tutu combines his talented work on the fret board, with his pleasing vocals for ten original compositions. Backing up Tutu on this release are the original Memphis Horns featuring Andrew Love on tenor sax and Wayne Jackson on trumpet and trombone. The Horns jazz up a couple of the tracks but largely remain in the background so as not to compete with or overshadow Jones' stinging guitar work. While mainly a blues based release, Tutu also includes three numbers that lean heavily towards R&B apparently in an attempt to get some radio play. Tutu has what it takes to become one of the great ones...now, if he can just get people to listen to what he has to offer"
3,Enh...,"This is the first Berg book I've read, and while I admire her writing style, I couldn't stand the main character, Patty. She was just too self-absorbed for my taste. It drove me crazy. Ethan was a slice of heaven, but the situation they were in was incredibly unrealistic to me. I know this kind of thing does happen, but I think there should have been a lot more conflict involved."
5,Incredible follow-up,"I first discovered Berg's talents when I read Joy School. I went on to read a few of her others, and I was excited to see another novel by this talented author. I immediately was attracted to the plot of the story because I can identify with the frustration of not finding the right ""one"". I have not finished this novel yet but I don't want to put it down. The only reason I have is because I don't want to finish this novel too quickly. It is worth enjoying."
2,Disappointing and a waste of time,Ill conceived and silly. Really a waste of time - I actually felt that the novel was very depressing. I will not be reading any of Ms. Berg's other novels. Too unrealistic to believe that a gay man would become the love of someone's life and that a person could not move on from this relationship.
1,"Would never know she wrote ""Talk Before Sleep""","Oh, my. What a disappointment. ""Talk Before Sleep"" had memorable lines, and real people I wanted to know. But this Patty character in this new book was silly and rather dumb. Sorry, but Elizabeth Berg needs to find the muse she had for ""Talk Before Sleep"" and lose her new one."
3,"sappy, somewhat unrealistic","Not Berg's best, and I've read a bunch. A far-better book that captures and explores the straight woman/gay man dynamic much more accurately is Pretzel Logic, a novel by Lisa Rogak: it's the funny but biting story of a woman married to a man who happens to come out during their marriage."
5,Loved it!!,"In many ways, I am Patty Anne. I think that's why I found myself laughing and crying throughout the reading of this book. Being in love with the gay man was interesting, but I think that what the author was conveying is the anguish of desperately wanting something or someone that we can't have. Hey, we've all been there, done that and probably read the book about it. I'd never read any of Elizabeth Berg's work before and just picked this one up on a whim. I'm glad I did. For me, it was worth the effort and I will probably pick up another of her books sometime in the near future."
1,Berg bashes women,"Until the Real Thing Comes Along is a first-time and last-time Berg read for me! I found this ridiculous litany of whining nothing less than a total insult to women. Berg portrays her leading lady as a pathetic, incompetent, dependent dreamer of the coming of Mr. Right. I don't think there was a paragraph in the piece that didn't contain a needful rumination of Patty's empty self. And, her inaccurate description and depiction of alzheimers disease is a further insult. I couldn't stop wondering if Berg needs some in depth psychoanalysis to help her accept her own fast ticking biological clock."
1,WHERE IS BERG?,If I want to read Danielle Steel I will buy her books...BERG where are you on this one! What a disappoinment...PLEASE RETURN!
2,Disappointing,"I've recently discovered Elizabeth Berg and have been greatly moved by 3 of her books. I was really looking forward to this one... though I am married with a child, I certainly do remember the occasional angst of my single days! HOWEVER, this book is SUCH a disappointment. The whole plot is just a cop-out and the protagonist is not very sympathetic. I suspect the book might be based in fact, which I suppose would somewhat redeem it....."
3,A good laugh to start with -- kind of inconclusive,"I've now read three of her books, Talk Before Sleep, Range of Motion, and now this . . . Talk before Sleep is still by far the best. I keep reading her because her books are short, entertaining and easy to follow. I hope she'll write something as good as ""Talk"" soon or I'll have to give up on her.One consistently good thing about her books is the voice she gives to the main character. She is an excellent writer.While this book starts out hilariously funny, it ends on a very hop-hum sort of note, with many different plot lines left ignored (it's not that I need a happy ending, it's that I wonder why she brought up certain topics and then never followed them).For a quick fun read, this'll do, but don't pay for it. Get it at the library (sorry Amazon)."
2,A feather-weight from Berg- not up to her usual standard,"Elizabeth Berg is one of my favorite writers but this book seemed like a ""B"" movie script. Patty, the main character, wants a home, a husband and a baby. When given the opportunity to have all of these, she continually passes up the chance. The reader is never really clear WHY that is- the character's motivation is really weak. And why she is stuck on Ethan, her now gay, once boyfriend other than the fact that he's beautiful- who knows? Why wouldn't she want to move on? Too much dialogue, not enough character development, very sappy (did she have to throw in the Mother with Alzheimers? What was up with that?). Pass on this Berg. Try Pull of the Moon or some of her other books. Seems like she tried write a book quickly and missed the quality she captured in her other novels."
3,Painful,"It's painful to read the book simply because, like Patty, I also feel so much of the longing and desire to have a baby. Sometimes I do feel I want a baby more than a husband. And it strikes true when the heart rules against the sensible mind - wanting so much for the perfect one (a perfect someone for me, not the perfect man). You want to kick her and knock her head, and yes I want to kick myself too. But OK, don't judge me for that.Berg seems to know how it all feels and and she describes the emotions well. Her language is awesome and so very true.However, I have to say the storyline could be better. Certain things seem to be too convenient making it much less interesting.I'm thinking of reading her other books."
1,A total waste of time. An insult to readers and women.,"This book was so bad, I almost returned it to get my money back. I am an avid reader and one-time fiction writer, and I could not believe the predicability of this plot. The story and character development were much like those of a soap opera (I don't watch soap operas), and thus were hard to take seriously. The main character resembled a bad ""Ally McBeal"" rip off. It astonishes me that this writer has won awards!I don't consider myself a feminist, however, I found the main character's complete obsession with finding a man and having a baby insulting to me as a woman, and insulting to men as well. Furthermore, her ""love"" for gay-Ethan had promise at first, but come on -- I do remember learning in my first writing class that a writer much ""show and not tell"" and I could not help but think of that as I read this book.As if you could not tell, I do not recommend this book if you normally enjoy good writing."
2,Very disappointing,"I love most of Berg's books, but this one had no depth and was a waste of time. I was very disappointed. Incredibly fluffy book."
2,"Disappointing book from Berg, usually a wonderful writer","Berg has never let me down before, but this book did. Nicely written, but plot was too pat, altogether too predictable. Neither Patty nor her friends and family seemed real to me. I can certainly empathize with Patty, being childless myself, but this novel was much too simplistic. Berg can usually nail a feeling or sentiment exactly, what happened this time?"
3,Seizes your interest and heart.,"This was a great book both light and enchanting. Not Berg's best, if you compare this with her other works; nonetheless well written and highly entertaining. Winning my heart, was how in this book Berg weaved in a character from her previous book ""Pull of the Moon,"" A reward for her faithful fans."
1,Blech,"Don't get me wrong-- I've been a fan of Elizabeth Berg's for quite some time now. I bought this one the day it came out-- began reading it right away...and was sorely disappointed. The main character, Patty, is just...blech. Like another reviewer said-- no back bone. She had no respect for herself and decided to have a child with a man who would never love her the way she wanted to be loved. She settled. I can't respect a woman like that-- who will fawn all over a man who will never want to be in a real loving relationship. Patty could have found a great man to love her and make a life with, but instead she kept going after Ethan. Blech..."
1,"unrealistic, silly, not good","I agree with the other reviewer that said the dialogue was not realistic. I too found myself thinking the same thing, who talks like this? I listened to this on audiobook and the reader made it even worse. She makes Patty sound really stupid (she is, but the reader made it worse) I really couldn't wait for it to be over and I hope I forget it soon."
3,OK BUT LEFT OUT SO MUCH!!,"The idea of this book is good, but alot of it was very unrealistic. I think if this were a real situation there would have been alot more emotion and not tied up so quickly at the end. These characters just did not act like someone in this situation should act. Getting pregnant on the first try and just moving on the way the story did just did not seem real to life to me. They also seemed very immature. I just think it could have been alot more emotional and really captured the idea of the book better."
1,bummer,"This product was totally out of date. The cd would not load, although on the book cover it stated that it is also for Mac. I called the company and they said that they have not made a cd for Mac users for many years---last century!!! And they are up to Willmaker 12 or something---VERY out of date!"
2,not good,"The dolphins screach, it's awful. The birds are peircing. The ocean sounds like it was done in the sound studio with guys spashing in a tub with their hands. A much better ocean c.d. is North Coast by Echoes of Nature. Check it out."
2,Yeeeesh!,I agree with the last reviewer. This sounds like it was recorded on a Mr microphone!!! Get Echoes of Nature's Bayou instead!
2,Not Sticky Enough,"I find the adhesive on this paper not being strong enough. If you leave the top of this tape exposed to water, it will eventually find its way behind this flashing. I wouldn't rely on it for long term water barrier. I had weep screeds flashed with this and they leaked first rain. The performance of adhesive is greatly degraded if exposed to the sun. This flashing tape comes right of the surface as soon as the sun warms it up, so make sure you have it covered as soon as it's installed.I find it work OK for covering the top of the parapet walls before the metal caps are installed."
5,orion,it was a simple installation and the wiring was easy. well built unit. perfect unit for mid useage systems. works great.
5,GREAT!!!!!!!,"GREAT GREAT GREAT!!!! MUST have for every Grandma out there, especially those that live far from their babies. All 3 of my kids love to see a book with their pictures and Nina's picture. I have the book memorized from reading it so much and often. I actually own 3 copies, one for each lol. It is the favorite book of ALL 3 of my kids. It is a great great buy and worth every dime."
2,Poor Quality,It said that the quality was good but one book was not even really acceptable. It had lots of peeling and usage to the spine. I was not very pleased.
1,Disappointed,"I received my book -- and I'll have to say it hardly looks used -- however, there was spots all over the front cover -- maybe mold??? Everytime I pick it up I start sneezing. Also the ink on this book is very faded. I already had a copy of it, and there is no comparison in the color. I hope the book is back in print soon so I can get a NEW book."
2,hope it gets better,This cd is my first from this band. From the soundbites they sounded interesting but this is my biggest disappointment from newer prog bands. They fit in better with Spandau Ballet than any where else. The vocals are too sappy and melodramatic and the guitar work is just ok until he starts trying to go beyond his talent level. The rest of the band is adequate but seem to be limited to their frontman.
1,Avoid - Terrible Product,Very painful and difficult to set your own code. One must press tiny plastic buttons that are held in place with a very strong spring. I bought two locks and one I managed to lock without setting the proper code so now it is useless as I cannot unlock it. The plastic bushings on the side of the other one disconnected from the housing while setting it - very poor construction. I will be returning both of these locks and will never purchase from this manufacturer again. Absolute rubbish.
1,Why do they even manufacture this lock?,"Same story as the other guy. My bike was stolen in about 10 seconds in broad daylight. I didn't read the part about it being only a lock for accessories. I do remember noting that it was rated 3 (out of 7?) for security. But I figured I would be only locking my bike in the daytime in public places. It didn't matter, obviously."
1,cable's nice but the lock is TERRIBLE,I bought one of these for my trips to the grocery store.....needed something relatively inexpensive due to my small budget.....but they've already had to replace the original one due to combo slippage. Got a brand new one from the manufacturer and this one has not even made it onto the bike.....couldn't set a new combo and the one that was factory set kept slipping. Very undependable for a senior citizen depending on her bike for transportation.
1,TKO LIQUIDATORS THE WORST SELLER,"PURCHASING THE LOCK FROM ""TKO LIQUIDATORS"" THE WORST SHOPPING EXPERIENCE ON AMAZON. I RECEIVED A ITEM COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM THE PICTURE ON THE WEB AND WHEN I CALLED THE SELLER,GUESS WHAT THEY SAID TO ME,A MAN TOLD ME TO HAVE MY LAWYER TO TALK TO HIM. AFTER THAT HE HUNG UP MY CALLS WHEN I CALLED, I WAS NOT THAT ANGRY SINCE HE CALLED ME ""TOUGH GUY"" ,BUT I HERE TO WARN YOU DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM ""TKO LIQUIDATORS"" ."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Criticising control of rebellious youth.The novel looks at one young man in particular, leader of a violent gang, and what he does, and what is done to him by a rather fascist government to rein him in.Also would seem to be about the usual fears of the old people of the powerless in general youth of the time, in whatever time.Unfortunately, a little dull to go along with that, an comes across as contrived at times."
1,Nonsensical story that has very little value,This book was written for pure shock value and nothing more. The ridiculous slang that he creates makes it almost impossible to enjoy the story in any sense.The story is predictable and not very entertaining. If someone was wanting to read a book on gang rape and the evils of mis spent youth then I am sure that there are other books out there there are at least written in such a way that you don't need an interpreter for all the fabricated words in this little book.I find it hard to believe that so many give this book a 5 star review. It scares me a bit to find out what my fellow human beings find as a quality piece of work.I was expecting more and was terribly disappointed. Certainly won't be reading this one again.
1,Frustrating and disturbing,"After twenty pages I threw this book against the wall. I have never read a more frustrating and disturbing book. All the dialogue is gibberish. In the first twenty pages, Alex and his lackies beat a guy senseless and rob him; they steal a car and trash it, they get into a vicious gang fight; they attack a couple at their home, destroy the husband's life work (his book ""A Clockwork Orange"") beat him and his wife senseless and rape the wife. This really ticked me off. I read this expecting a great story because it's a ""classic"", but I was severly disappointed. If you want to read the book, save yourself the frustration trying to wade through the garbage and read the last three pages."
1,scary as hell,"This book freaked me out, i didn't know that people could think of doing that to people in our future. i first read this in sixth grade but decided to read it again in eighth. for the parts that i didn't understand the psyche teacher helped me with. it was a good book but has horrifying parts in it. i'll never look at a glass of milk the same way again."
1,absolutely hated it!!,I absolutely hated this book. It's a grim tale about despicable characters that I can't recommend to anyone.
1,morons,"the negative actions depicted in this book are not a good thing...duh. that was tony's point! ""no good, no bad"" idiocy makes tony barf his other lung. take responsibility for yourselves!!! (read that again!) try shock therapy if you're still watching sports on TV. help someone today."
5,A Clockwork Orange,"I thought A Clockwork Orange is a great book. It is certainlynot for the weak, though. Its kind of hard at first, because ofNadSat, the language derived from Russian that Alex uses. I also recommend that you also see the movie of the same title by Stanley Kubrick and starring Malcolm McDowell."
4,Interesting commentary.,"While I enjoyed the story and the point the author makes, the book was rough going because of the nonsensical slang. Although it is an integral part of the tale, it makes it very difficult to read and understand clearly.The commentary provided on the moral and ethical questions regarding punishment and social justice is very insightful, made even more so by the ending which was excluded from the original release here in America and as a corollary Kubrick's film."
5,Fantastic book,"Great book written all in the gang-slang of the futuristic day. This book is a classic and a must-read for those who liked the (also excellent) movie. But the book has a lot of neat things missing from the movie and one is able to enjoy more detail of the language Burgess created out of a hodge-podge of disjointed Russian (for the most part.) Like in the movie, you will soon be rooting for young Alex no matter that he is a rapist and murderer. This is part of the genius of the work."
5,"Stunning, errr . . . bloody horrorshow","Great use of language, social critique, political awareness, stunning presentation, color images, this text has it all. Deep philosophy without a hint of (well maybe a little) didacticism. One of the greatest works of all time. Stay with it at all costs, the language will grow on you by chapter three. Viddy well!"
5,Awesome,"Well, after you get used the invented slang (which doesn't take long) it is very easy to read. I personally like this tongue and at times it can be quite funny. The first part of the book is violent, but what isn't these days? This book is an excellent look at what can happen with government given too much power which I feel we are drifting closer and closer to these days, with the Govt. protecting us from ourseleves and all. I really liked this story and has become one of my favorite books of all time."
5,Real horrorshow!,"That means real good in Nadsat - the vernacular that's based on Russian taken up by the English teens in this futuristic dystopian masterpiece. You must viddy(see) clockworkorange.com for its Nadsat-English dictionary for the first 30 pages so that you can fully comprehend everything that's going on. After that, you're homefree and it's smooth sailing!The use of the language adds another dimension to this ingenious work that is unlike any other book you will ever read. This book is so amazing, I don't want to give anything away. It's Lord of the Flies, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, 1984, and American Psycho all mixed up into one. Anthony Burgess creates an original, intense, and enlightening work that separates itself from the mundane formula-laden novels of today."
4,Strange But Good,"Frist of all, if there was ever a book that needed a R rateing this would be it. However, dispite the disturbing amount of voilence, and the at times incomprehesable slang the book is a must read. It's thrilling and creepy veiw of the future leads one to question the morality of punishment and the roll of society to ""cure"" our criminals of there nature to kill. In the end the book asks the pressing question, when does the cure become worse then the deises?On the down side, the book uses a strange varity of slang that takes a while to get used too, and at times one wonders if they'll ever get through parts. Never the less, it is still a wonderful adventure into the mind of a psycho who, by the end to the book, is much more sane, then the rest of his society."
4,Brilliant,"A Clockwork Orange is a genius piece composed by none other than the linguistic mastermind Anthony Burgess. From the beginning to the end of this horrific and, at the same time, humorous tale, Burgess recounts the adolescent happenings of a young nadsat named Alex. Using the first-person, Alex tells his teenage story of being institutionalized, and the accounts that follow his early release. The language in this book is incredible; no other author holds rank with Burgess."
4,Horrorshow,"The best part of this book was the ""nadsat"" speech that the author created, mostly from Russian, for the book. Learning all the words as they were carefully placed so they could be understood first from context was pretty entertaining. Overall, a real horrorshow raskazz."
4,This bookw is great.,A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess was a very good book. It is about a 15 year-old boy and his very violent life. The story takes place in a futuristic city. Alex and his friends go around the city and act like terrors. The story starts to get exciting when he goes to jail and is the test subject for a new method of state reform. I liked this book because it shows that actions have reactions. The bad part about the book is the dialect. I think Anthony Burgess over does the dialect and makes the book hard to understand.
5,"Dark, Comic Violence","It's to Burgess' credit that he makes the protaganist of Clockwork Orange an unsympathetic character and the state's attempt to ""adjust"" him an almost worthwhile achievement. Burgess makes the typical black and white judgements more difficult for us.But Clockwork Orange's genius is more than this. Burgess injects Russian words into his gang of toughs creating a lower class dialect . Knowing Russian makes the book much easier to read yet defeats the authors purpose- he wants the reader to determine the word meanings by context.Clockwork Orange is a darkly comic work that stands as one of the best books of the twentieth century."
4,A Classic,"Quiet a bizzare and at times, complicated book. But its classic. Anthony Burgess uses language like no other. Its a true work of art."
4,Pretty good book!,I just finished reading this dark masterpiece by Burgess and I have to say it was pretty good and I'm probably gonna read it again.Alex is one of the most confused charachters ever printed(like De Niro in Taxi Driver)and I hated it when he beat people and raped women but I felt sorry when everyone beat the carp out of him later. Anyway this is a pretty good book and highly reccomended!(I'm really 14!)
5,If you don't read this book...,"In one word: Coolness. Anthony Burgess has won my devotion with this one. Almost the most disturbing thing I've ever read, this book is satisfying all the way. There is no bad part. It never gets boring. And it is so creative in it's language concepts that... well it's creative! Read this book, or you are doing an injustice to yourself. Oh, and watch the movie too."
3,"Right book, wrong edition","The copy I received was in good enough shape, but it was not an early edition as the illustration implied. ""A Clockwork Orange"" can be a frustrating book to buy, as the American editions originally were published without the final chapter, and used booksellers seldom make a distinction. Such was the case here. I've handed the book off and will be more careful looking for a complete edition from now on."
5,great,"fantastic once you get the hang of the language and slang. Suggestion--watch the movie first to put a face with the characters. The movie is but a fraction of the book, so it won't spoil anything. LOVE IT!!!"
3,Silly Made up Slang,"Part of the my 3 star rating is probably due to the lack of a character to identify with in this book. I think that, for one, made the book much more difficult to truly get into.Most obnoxious however is the slang language used by the teens of the book. It was good idea as a device to help take the reader to another time and place, but let's get real...words like bezoomny, slooshy, and klootch may be taking it a bit too far. I found them distracting.On the positive side, the book does a great job of raising a potentially realistic social issue."
3,Interesting Book.,"'A Clockwork Orange' is an interesting book that has become a classic for the wrong reasons. First, it is a classic because the film is so famous. Second, it is not a classic because of what the book is trying to say, but a classic because of the grotesque material in the story. Personally, I didn't think it was that great, but one should read it for curiosity."
3,funny and philosophical,"The slang stuff makes it seem like a teenager is really telling the story. The way the word ""like"" is used way too much also makes it seem real. The story is unrealistic, but there's some truth behind it. The dilema that society is faced with, of increasing crime and how to contain it, is interesting to ponder. It's cool how the author presents a criminal reformation idea that failed. Personally I don't think there is a quick fix to things like crime and youth running wild. Sometimes you just have to let things happen the way they will.I think the ""controversial"" last chapter is a drag and the book is better without it. Ending at chapter twenty would have left me with a feeling of wanting more. Chapter 21 wrapped the book up with too much of a nice warm feeling that the rest of the book didn't have, and doesn't seem to belong."
5,A great book that was made into THE best movie EVER!!,"Some may say this book was too violent in too many ways. I just felt all the violence helped establish character (The best character establishment I'VE ever seen!). This book also had the best plot I've ever seen. There are only three cases where the movies are better than the book and that's ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""The Shining"" (which doesn't really count because the only correct things are the characters and setting) and this. This is the only movie that still brings tears to my eyes (on the part where Frank gets his revenge), gives me goosebumps (almost the whole movie) and makes Beethoven's ninth symphony my favorite musical peice ever. But this movie never would have been made without this beautifully crafted story."
5,This book is awesome.,"This is one of the most entertaining and engrossing books that I have ever read. A must-read. If you haven't seen the movie, wait until after you have read the book. One of Anthony Burgess's best."
5,Amazing,"This book poses some many ethical questions one can not help but read the book more than once to get the full meaning. The intelligence of this book surpasses everything I have ever read. Not only does this book present questions most people do not wish to deal with, it shows a mastery of language no one else has shown before. This book should definatly be read by one and all."
5,"original, involving, genial, surprising","The most striking thing of this book is certainly the language.The second one is the characterization of Alex: cruel,violent,desperate (and fan of Beethoven).Completely different from anything else you could have ever read."
2,Dazed and confused,"A Clockwork orange is a good choice for reading material if you have a lot of time and you feel like reading a book twice. I was very confused all through this book. It is not something that I would read again. I didn't care for the language, I found that it made it very difficult to understand and follow. The message of the book is sort of good. The people really want to help Alex but the way they go about it can be debated. Some people i'm sure will love this book, but I have found that this book wasn't for me."
2,A solitary disclaimer,"I have read quite a few of the reviews on 'Amazon' and everyone of them praises the book highly. They talk about the inventiveness and energy of the language, the sympathy they have for the major character Alex, especially when his Nature is forcibly changed, and he loses the ability to be himself , including the ability to enjoy Beethoven's music. They speak about the skill in depicting the main character's alienation, and the dreary world of an imagined future technical dystopia.They speak about a vision Burgess presents, and the fact that in spite of the language containing many at first non- understandable slang terms, that the work is nonetheless really understandable.I didn't like the book. I read quite a bit of it. I just could not get into it. I do not like violence even fictional violence. I simply could not find any of this entertaining or amusing, however I know the great gifts Burgess has as writer.I may be wrong, but I simply do not like this one."
3,it's set in the future?,"i never realized that until i read the other reviews.i was going to give this 1 star but i read another customer review that says that the point was ""one should grow up and take responsibility for one's actions, or get shock therapy"". if that's the case, it's pretty good for a book of its length. i don't find ""is it better to be good by force, or to be bad by choice?"" (supposedly the question it wants to raise) stirring. sounds like a topic for a junior high debate."
2,Glorifies thuggery. Period.,"Utterly devoid of any formal or artistic redeeming qualities. A trivial exercise in giving vent to base, animalisitic urges. Totally complicit in the violence it portrays."
5,Psycho-Psychological Thrill-Ride,"A Clockwork Oarnge is Anthony Burgess' account of an eccentric teenager who occupies his time with trips to the local milk bar where he may indulge in milk ""with knives in it."" When not at the milkbar, Alex, our psycho-anti-hero cruises the town with his droogs searching for some twisted fun.This book is a must for all interested in psychology. This book is a monster to analyze, but it holds many rewards"
5,A Malenky bit of baddiwad and dobby!!!,"If there is one thing besides its content, it is the vocabulary the characters use. Don't be discouraged. The book is one of the best pieces of literature there is. A bright look at violence, government, and ""free will."" Unlike what most think, I believe that the 21st chapter does contradict the flow of the book. Brilliant!! The movie, although not as good as the book, is terrific with a splendid visual of Burgess' creation."
5,Another Five Star,"This may be guilding the lily, but I might as well put in my two cents. Yes, this book was so great I enjoyed every page. What a ride. What a trip. Great use of language. The kind of book you want to have in your library, for occasional re-reading (altho I havent done so). This book will knock you upside the head and you will like it!!!"
5,"Whatever you do, DO NOT STOP reading this book!","After reading the first few pages of Clockwork Orange, I thought it would be too painful to continue, but the word substitutions gradually became clear, and the story evolved into a powerful and-surprisingly-humorous narrative. Gang leader Alex rebels against society in every way, rejecting decency, work, and even language. His mischief eventually leads him to prison at age 15, and mishaps there result in his being selected for criminal rehab by association. The rest is what turns the novel into a classic--the criminal becomes victim, grows more charming in the process, and learns how to grow up."
4,"Offbeat, insightful, and disturbing","Clockwork Orange stands as a excellent piece of literature that stands the test of time. At times its characters are offbeat, and also brilliant, and still disturbing. Highly creative and packed with a colorful (and different) view of the world."
5,a truly horrowshow book-you wont be let down,"jump into the mind of little alex and prepare to be caught by the whirlwind. you'll follow this 'humble narrator' as he tramples and stomps his way through a world he thinks he can control... you'll get inside his head and travel the ups and downs in the peak of nadsat fashion... burgess thrusts readers into a unique, futuristic world where young evildoers rule the streets (at first you may feel a bit lost in the language but by the second chapter you'll find your footing and by the end you'll read the talk as if youve known it all along). this book will stir up your mind, questioning ideas like human tendencies towards good/evil and the gov'ts constant manipulation and yearning for ultimate control --definitely a stimulating and satisfying read (quick one too-it took me all of 3 days) go for it!"
5,"Amazing book, a personal favorite","Regardless of what anyone says, this is a book that will stick with you. If you have the patience to get through the first few pages and to begin to apply meanings to the slang words you will not be disappointed. Years after I have read this book I still find times when the slang pops into my mind. To top it all off, this book tells one great story. Highly recommended, way better than the much praised film, even though the film follows the book near 100%."
4,Dystopian Classic,"I love dystopia, but somehow never got around to this book. I finally picked it up and gave it a read. Right out the door the nadsat language threw me. I found it a true struggle to get through the first two chapters. but after that it became easier and flowed as a book should. a must read!"
1,Kindle version cheats you,"Just so you know, the Kindle version of the Norton edition is just the novel and Burgess' intro. It doesn't contain the supplementary materials that make a Norton edition valuable to have."
5,The greatest novel i have ever viddied.,"This book is pheonomanal. There arent enough words to describe it. It is, without a doubt Horrorshow."
4,"Good book but,","This is a good book; however, it does help if the reader has an extensive Russian vocabulary. Talking to peers and reading criticism, I've yet to find anyone else who has realized that his ""made-up"" language is realy just phonetic russian translaions (ie. korova-cow, mesto-place/location, moloko-milk, bog-god, mozg-brain/center, peet-to drink, horrorshow-good, ect.) Why hasn't anyone else noticed? I'm afraid that to get the true essence of the book I've had to keep my Russian dictionary with me at all times, and as a result, the reading has been rather slow."
5,A Clockwork Orange,"This book is not for the week of heart. However, it is a book for the strong of mind. This book is way out there, and I mean WAY OUT THERE. If you like such off the wall books as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, than this book is for you. Have fun, the book is real horrorshow, as Alex puts it! ;)"
5,A Dystopian Masterpiece,"Anthony Burgess' finest work is not only a disturbing look into the future, but also asks intruguing ethical questions. I found Burgess'use Nadsat Language intresting, athough it is difficult to understand. Espically disturbing is the dystopian world Burgess invents. The book's combination of a socialist society and decayed western culture makes it an intresting read"
2,wierd and quite hard to read,"for one.. prepare to spend awhile rereading and thinking.... the use of language here is INSANE.... it is alot like that guy from snatch.. the rhyming thing.. lol.. without the ryming. it is quite confusing. using some sort of freakish british cockney slang.. almost a made up language.i didnt finish it..........has the same type of strange and confusing language as ""lock, stock and two smoking barrels""... unless you are quite good at understanding made up languages.. do not read."
3,PR-Heinzmann,"A Clockwork Orange is a gruesome story of a teen living in a futuristic world in which the streets are ruled by chaos and violence. The protagonist(using this term loosely) is named Alex and is the leader of a street gang who spend their time fighting, stealing, and raping. This goes on until Alex is caught and put in a program designed to reform him. A Clockwork Orange is an interesting, but disturbing look into violent criminal actions and a desire that is can only be motivated by an obvious lack of a moral compas. If the reader can get past the excrutiatingly frustrating use of random slang dialogue and the graphic depictions of rape and other violent crimes, then A Clockwork Orange is a very interesting read that reallly forces one to take a look a the violence in our own society. A Clockwork Orange was not an easy read, but it was still a very interesting one. Therefore, I would give it a 7 out of 10."
5,The fine line between good and evil...,"This book is a masterpeice of literature, I think. The language is ultimately effective to create the environment of an all-too-real future. Sex, Drugz, and classical music. It asks the question of what good truly is, and who really are the bad people. Will being truly good cost us our free will? Basically a great read- I recommend it to anyone, and yes, the last chapter is a contribution not a hindrance to the story. All in all a zammechat horrorshow raskazz."
5,Burgess is Genius,"Clockwork Orange is a wonderful original piece. The whole new language or slang that Burgess invents for the book gets some getting used to but once you're a few pages into it you'll get quite used to it.The story takes place in England which is not really relvant to the story but that where it take place. The main character, Alex, is a young thug who robs and hurts people for fun with his friends. He messes around with the homeless, beats up other gangmembers, he rapes women and in general causes a lot of havoc.One day he gets caught by the police and he kills an old woman in her home (by accident). He hears about a deal where if he lets some doctors perform some new experimental procedure on him they'll release him a lot sooner, so he goes along with it. Here is where the story really begins to unfold. I won't ruin for you so you'll have to read the book. Trust me you'll enjoy it."
1,A classic? Classic junk.,"I appreciate a difficult read. I appreciate fiction from different countries, cultures, and times. I appreciate not trusting the government. I can even appreciate poorly written books IF the story is powerful. This ""book"" was the worst of all of these statements. The slang was difficult for difficulties sake. The message of the government was heavy handed. The pity for the protagonist was feeble. The overall message was poorly crafted and framed more as a statement than a thought provoking question. I can't remember ever rating something 1 star, but I want the time i spent reading this back. It was truly horrible."
3,One of the most unique styles I'd ever read.,"This is definitely one of the strangest books I've read in my life, but I by far do not regret it. Burgess uses an interesting technique combining the Russian language with the old English to make up the teen language of the future called nadsat. This is a story told from the first person by a teenage boy about his vicious gang times as a kid at 15, his time in jail, and his ""new"" treatment which made him into a senseless ""good person but not by his own choice. ""Man ceases to be man when he cannot choose."" Read this book, you'll be glad you have."
4,weird,"this is a crazy awesome book.... I had to read a couple of things a few times since it's oddly written, but all in all, a great read! thanks"
4,Good.,"Although the condition of the book was a little iffy for its price, it was a great buy and a great book. Thank you"
5,Don't Skip This Just Because You Saw The Movie,"Burgess novel in some ways is more enjoyable than Kubrick's masterpiece. The book is more of a satire than the movie, so it allows you to laugh out loud as well as cringe. Burgess, who was a musician prior to being a writer, has a very lyrical style to his writing which makes the spoken language a blast to read. As the kids say ""real horrorshow."""
3,difficult to follow,"A good writer is able to create entire worlds, entire histories for their works. A great writer is able to explain everything with little confusion. The ideas are intense in Burgess' classic work but the nature of this intensity, the radical differences and strong slang, undermine the ability of the reader to enjoy and follow along. Not a book to read for fun, but it raises some powerful questions about society and the individual, where do my rights interfer with yours and visa versa."
5,A CLOCKWORK ORANGE,AWESOME BOOK! THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST STORIES I HAVE EVER READ. IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!
4,SUMMER READING MADE FUN.,"This maybe one of the greatest books of the 20th century. I purchased this book july 5 and was so drawn into it i had finished in with 3 days. The was compelled to speak as they do in the book. No one could understand me until, well i was at a 7-11 and i ask for some moloko (milk) the store clerk instantly relized where i had gotten in from and we began to discuss the book. Now it has been 4 years. I have a very important question Amber will you marry me? the book brought us together and will keep us that way. Are friends may laugh be we will always have the memories and we will always be together."
5,A real horrorshow indeed,"PS~ 20 NOT 21 CHAPTERS! ((( American Version)))This is NOT the original Anthony Burgess 21 chapter version.The American version (20 chapters) was adapted byStanley Kubrick for the film, which ends quite differently.[...]Read the REAL DEAL!Jaime Pico"
4,Yikes!!!,"Burgess said that this was one of his least favorite novels but when it comes to books that delve into the basic primal instincts of man, this one tops the lists. He (Alex) exhibits an entirely nonchalant attitude toward violent crime. I think that Burgess was trying to get readers to understand that if man does not stop his violent downward spiral, the world found in ""A Clockwork Orange"" will become the world we live in. A real horrorshow effort."
5,Awesome,"Well i never really wrote a review before so its not that great. but yeah, this book is great, it took a while to learn what some of the english words meant translated to american slang, but it really makes you think. this is my current favorite book."
4,A Clockwork Review,An ultraviolent coming of age story told in a unique and raw manner. The film (one of my favorites) doesn't capture the spirit of the tale. The last chapter was the piece that had been missing.
4,A Clockwork Orange,"This book, given the era when written was a change in literature. It explores youth disenchantment and thier values in a world increasingly diffciult for them to come to terms with, related to such things as extremes of wealth and systems that do not treat all as equals.There is no question that the behaviours related to violence are unacceptable. However, Burgess is trying to suggest that without a changed world, these types of behaviours remain possible.The most important aspect of the book, however, relates to the ""treatment' the main character receives that renders him unable to continue to commmit crimes. The thesis here is that we need to provide a world where people choose to behave appropriately rather than to remove peoples' right to make choices.A highly recoemmeneded text."
3,Mostly Good Book.,"If you are a fan of the dystopian drama then look no further. This book has a wonderful and imaginitive plot with a good moral to follow. Burgess's unique storytelling abilities, combined with the ""Nadsat"" dialect which he himself adapted for this novella, makes it a great read for any type of reader!"
5,A terrifying and marvelous book,"Anthony Burgess uses the central character and narrator of the story, Alex, to show the differance in good and evil, and the meaning of human freedom. This book is a philosophical satire on ""the distortions of the single and collective minds."""
5,Real horrorshow book,"When i first started reading the book, the slang was intimidating and i thought i wasn't going to be able to understand it, but i got through that, and now i even use some of it. Anyway, i loved this book, and i loved the movie as well. I finished this book about 5 days ago and i just can't stop thinking about it. Once you get into this book, you won't want to put it down. Trust me."
2,Hard to read,Found this hard to read because of the slang words used. I read it but it was not not near as good as I thought it would be.
3,Great Book: Lousy Printing,"Lewis's book has been through many editions, and as a short intro to Arab history it is hard to beat. What would not be hard to beat would be the dreadful production values of this OUP paperback edition. It is printed on horrible paper, and the binding keeps falling off. Shame on Oxford UP for putting out such a good book in such a shoddy format."
3,decent,"This is a decent attempt to reveal the history of a very misunderstood place. Lewis, however, does little to destroy the misunderstanding...only presenting some facts with some questionable interpretations."
1,Done on a very very low budget,"NOT worth what the asking price is, a good message, but the video is just terrilbe.... seems like they just videoed a night a prayer meeting or something, low low budget.."
4,Like reading a Bill Cosby stand-up act.,"A good book. Funny, but a little hard to comprehend. He was young around the same time my parents were. Still a very entertaining book."
3,Mixed feelings.,"""Childhood"" started off rather funny, but then lost steam as it progressed. Bill Cosby is a very funny person, and I've enjoyed his stand-up comedy about childhood and parenting, but reading about it is very different, and I felt he tried too hard to be funny. I sometimes got confused at what age he was speaking about in his childhood and sometimes it all just felt muddled. I also wished he had either solely spoken about his childhood, or his own children, as they transitions into both were a bit choppy. I ""sorta"" recommend"
1,disastrous,It is disastrous to know that this is the most relevant book about Spiritism. If you want to know something read the book The Gospel According to Spiritism.
2,Patton's Drive,"This was a decent book for what it is.It is NOT a book for someone who likes to read and learn more than you can get from watching the History Channel.While a few scattered photos and maps can make a book interesting, this was a book of pictures with very little text, lacking anything you probably don't know already.There are a number of really good bucks about WWII, and this is not one of them. At least not in my opinion."
3,Decent intro into the genius that was Patton,"While hardcore military buffs and historians will find this book lacking, those looking for a brief history of the legend of General Patton along with some interesting pictures will find some useful information in here. Written like a high school history book, it presents facts with no real analysis or interpretation. There are several pictures (half from museums), but many times the captions don't really match the pictures they accompany. My favority part of the book was the last chapter, which relays quotes from Patton on leadership and adds a more personal touch to what is otherwise mostly a history lesson. If you are curious about Patton, this is a good place to start. If you are already well versed in the legend, or are a WWII aficionado, this book will disappoint."
2,interesting pics and mediocre dialog,"Just a collection of tank pictures and some dialog that is not clear , concise or particularly interesting. Look elsewhere."
4,Glad I bought the book!,"This book gave me the information I needed to get Windows 98 installed and everything setup and working the way I wanted it to work.The documentation I recieved with my new system was lame -- besides I really feel I should have gotten a book like this with my system.I'd looked at other titles and found them either too superficial and cartoony, or too overwhelming and expensive.I like the author's writing style, and the book is organized well. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a little help with Windows 98. Good price too."
2,"Great cover, contents disappointing","The clever and knowing subtitle, ""The manual you should have received with Windows 98,"" combined with the good-looking and orderly layout, drew me to this book. It is clearly intended for the neophyte, and I bought it when I switched from Mac to Windows 98. Like many new users I was mystified - and frustrated - by various aspects of Windows and looked to the index for help on specifics. Nearly every time, this book failed to address my question. Now that I'm fairly competent this book is useful, but would not recommend for the Mac user new to Windows. The author has not adequately anticipated the most common new-user emergencies, and the ""Troubleshooting"" sections - that you turn to in a bit of a panic - are quite meager."
3,Average at best....,"Kent's novel starts out with a bang and immediately thrusts you into edge of you seat intrigue and excitement. It's twists and turns that while interestingly written, tend to be predictable. Unfortunately predictable is preferable to what comes later. Later we are treated to plot holes, which can only leave you to wonder if there was a change made regarding a sub-character halfway through the writing of novel, or if he simply missed filling in the holes in a rush to finish. (At least that was what I was left wondering.) Still the greatest insult is towards the end of the book where it begins to read, not like an original novel, but closer to a script for a bad episode of 'General Hospital'."
2,Jerky characters,"Somewhere there is a story struggling to get out, but this book just didn't work for me. The main reason is I did not like the main characters Ryan and Cass. Just when things seem to be settling down into a rhythm one or both of them would go ballistic.Basing a plot on government conspiracies is fine. There is plenty of material out there to work with, but this book begins with an intriguing Ludlum like premise that started to morph into somethign akin to the Fugitive then drives right over a cliff.I stuck with most of the way, but finally gave up around page 300 and the upteenth inane character drama."
2,Too melodramatic.,I was looking forward to a good old fashioned adventure/mystery. What I wound up with was an overdramatic Lifetime movie with a whole lot of unnecessary filler. When it wasn't being dramatic it was predictable and a shade ridiculous. I did enjoy the overall story that put Ryan Elder in search of the something in the present to understand his past. The mysterious Department 30 was a great touch which I think should have been explored a little further. If you're looking for a quick summer read then this is your book.
5,AWESOE,"I read alot of books and I just happened to pick this one up off the shelf. When I read the back cover and saw that this was his debut book, I was intrigued when I couldn't put it down. Not too many writers grab my attention like that. I normally get bored with books after about 60-90 pages. This book, I read in two days. There was so much suspence and twists and turns, I couldn't wait to turn the page to find out what would happen next. I would recommend this book to everyone. I can't wait to read his next book."
1,Garbage!,"This is the worst product I've ever purchased! It came with no instructions and ended up making my platinum jewelry look worse, not better. It was a complete waste of money! I threw it in the trash where it belongs."
3,Neat little film.,"I saw this at an old editing suite where I interned for the summer. I'm not sure what to say about it, other than we glimpse a man who is the victim of crime, and, as such, nearly gets forced into criminality when he cannot resolve his own dilemma.You know, you can read all you want into films, and I'm sure there're layers of stuff there, but I found the film to be rather simple. Not a bad film, and kind of endearing, but not one that I think is worthy of lots of praise. So, call me what you will, and I know this film flaunted the tradition of campy entertainment, but it is just a movie.The version I saw had both options for dubbing and subtitles. I think I opted for the subtitle with Italian dialogue.See it once."
3,I wish the video quality was better,"The story was mostly great although the ending left me hanging. The directing and acting were good, the characters were likeable, but, geez, was the poor video quality a production tool to make the picture even more bleak than the story?"
3,Classic needs a re-release,"Classic movie about the cruel nature of life, of inescapable fate. The dvd itself is pretty bad, with defects shown in the transfer, along with terrible audio.Hopefully a re release will be offered, with the latest restoration software being used. The dvd came out early on, before the current restoration techniques were used.And the audio/subtitles just suck!"
3,"Wonderful movie, but...","It's a wonderful movie, but beware: on this DVD, the subtitles are not optional, they're always there, distorting the picture and getting on one's nerves..."
5,Bicycle Thief,classic Movie at a great price. Quick ship and works great. What else is there? Great Job!!
1,Lemonlime,"This movie was like watching paint dry. These critics are all lemmings. A few well-known authored critics give a movie raves, and everyone else follows behind, afraid they would appear uneducated in the ""film arts"" circles. To say that this film was either ""the best"" or ""one of the best"" foreign films ever made is an abomination! I'd take ANY Kurosawa film, over this one. What about ""Fanny and Alexander"" or any of the Bergman films? I just wasted one and a half hours watching this movie. What a waste! If I wanted to watch something this banal I would have watched the 6+ hour movie that Andy Warhol made of a person sleeping."
4,Painfully brillant!,"""The Bicycle Thief"" was an absolutely mesmerizing film. From start to finish there is a tension in the film that is absolutely riveting. De Sica takes us through post-war Italy where employment is scarce and competition in the local job market is high.It is interesting to watch the fall of an honest man to the very depths of despair and thievery in an attempt to keep a job so he can care for his family.Tense and moving."
5,Not Disappointed,"I waited a long time to see this movie. I had heard good things about it over the years and my expectations had grown and grown and .... I was not disappointed when I finally got to see it. Different - simple, powerful, raw and angry. A masterpiece."
5,Unbelievably moving - It will bring you to tears.,"In post-World War Two Italy, this film captures Italian society through the figures of a young boy and his father. The two actors were hired by DeSica (the director), having no previous professional training. This story captures the essence of suffrage, redemtion, and forgivness, all within the boundaries of Fatherhood - choosing between right and wrong - even if it means that chosing right will not put food on your family's table. Once you've seen this film, it will always be close to your heart."
4,Classic look at the deprivations of post-WW II Italy,"""The Bicycle Thief"" is a classic piece of cinema. It was made in almost guerrilla-type fashion in 1947 amidst the deprivations and devastation of post World War II Italy. Most of the people appearing in the film aren't real actors. Director Vittorio De Sica utilizes Rome's populace to fill the screen with people rushing en masse to and fro to simply make ends meet. You get a tremendous sense of how flat on its back Italy was after its devastating and total defeat as an Axis power.So, for such a classic, why the four stars? Well, because the quality of the presentation is simply abysmal. For such a cherished piece of film history (it's a touchstone for quite a number of people), its treatment is a shame: the video is blurry, the sound a mess, the subtitles spotty and of dubious accuracy (""here's the general idea,"" they seem to say, ""you figure it out). Surely, Image Entertainment could have done better than this end product."
3,One major disappointing factor,"The resotration two-disc set is everything that's been reported on, except for one thing. The music is too soft. Strange, that they'd somehow subdue this beautiful original score that's so crucial to the film's atmposphere. Until the restored version, the music was a major character; now it's only soft background music. For me, that's a major disappointment. However, I suppose the volume could be turned up, and hopefully it won't distort the spoken dialogue. My volume was maximum, and still the music (not the dialogue) was too soft."
2,Muted Music Track,"Image Entertainment has done an overall mediocre job on ""The Bicycle Thief DVD."" On the one hand, the video is excellent: crisp, sharp, a pleasure to behold.On the other, the audio has muted music, diffuse and dull throughout. The memorable, classic film score is rendered a serious blow here. Whereas dialoge is clear and full, the music, so important to this film, is actully of poor quality.To test what could have been, click on the trailer and note the fullness of the score. That's what should have been the case for the film.The overall rating of Image Entertainment's work here is below average. How unfortunate to ruin this great classic."
5,the final scene is the scene that counts,"When the father gets slapped in front of the son by the policeman at the end of the film, who then - after having seen all the film and witnessed the relationship between father and son - will not be moved? Who will still believe in capitalism or any other ism, defending the rich or powerful against the poor and powerless? Noone with a heart, that's for sure. The whole film builds up to this final scene and the comprehension of it. If You just see this scene without having seen the rest of the movie first, the impact will not be as strong. This is an anarchistic film, in the good sence of the word 'anarchy'- a society in which strength, beauty and love is allowed but in which power and oppression cannot be allowed."
3,Form is great to look at; not so great in function,"Purchased this when our classic rush-covered Corning insulated coffee carafe finally died (couldn't find a replacement glass). Was attracted to (and not disappointed by) the fun color and the plastic exterior (easy to clean, etc). However, it appears that the designers designed this without testing the ability to pour from it. Flawed design, in that important sense."
4,Almost Perfect,Good overall product by Leifheit - great design and color options which is typical for products from Europe. The only drawback is the fact that it does not pour very well - kind of splashy. Otherwise it's fun to use it and easy to clean.
2,DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ME AND MY GRANDKIDS,The story is okay but the movie only lasted 24 minutes! My fault for not reading all the description I guess. Just can't bring myself to recommend this movie. I wanted to add a new movie to my holiday collection for the grandkids to watch but was sorely disappointed and so were they.
2,Once Upon a Mediocre Book,"Once Upon a Universe, although it uses a creative way to teach its readers high level science theories, was not a very interesting book. Its flawed adaptations of fairy tales made it a difficult book to enjoy and really get into. Such adaptations include ""Snow White and the Particularly Little People"", which teaches the reader about particles and atoms. The less-than-captivating adaptations became nearly monotonous, as Gilmore occasionally went into excessive details concerning each subject. In conclusion, although it was a failed attempt at twisting fairy tales, it did teach me interesting scientific information. I would not recommend this book to any except those people who are excessively into science."
4,A Weird Western,"This film has a great cast combined as a weird violent family, who all get justice in the end from the sheriff."
1,One star is too many for this film!,"I wish there was a negative star rating available to select, but alas, I had to give it a whole star.This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. When it was not boring me to tears, it was needlessly discusting (a scene where a man steps into a hole filled with human waste comes to mind). ...The only reason I rented it was because one of my favorite stars was in it, but by the time he got on screen I was so mad that I had payed to see this that I didn't even enjoy seeing him in it...."
1,Save yourself 2 hours of your life,"This movie was absolutely awful. I really can't explain it any other way. It didn't help that Dwight Yoakam produced, directed, and starred in it. The characters are so unbelievable and the dialouge is painful. It was very obvious that this movie was written by a male. The women characters were very fake. (Well, come to think of it, the male characters were pretty bad also.) Don't waste your time. Rent ""Tombstone""."
4,Not in the majority,"I guess I'm not part of the majority here as i think this is a great character driven film. Yes it's not tombstone or the wild bunch, but it's not meant to be. This film is supposed very intelectual & that is probably why most people just don't get it. Oh well."
5,"Gritty, yet engaging","In these times, when ""they just don't make westerns like they used to"", Dwight Yokum came up with this improbable gem. With an interesting cast of proven talent, Yokum stands the genre on its ear with an odd after-death nether-world where the good guys and bad guys seem to end up in the same town.There is more than a little camp involved, and I marveled at how the cast was able to keep their composure. That being said, there is enough serious food for thought as the recently departed get to work out their unresolved issues in the dusty hereafter.To make this movie even more interesting, the grittiness of the film lends a believable authenticity, and the music give it the somewhat melancholic longing which seems to typify existence away from urban distraction or vistas of tropical paradise."
1,"Very, very, disappointed.","Put it this way ...watching ""South of Heaven, West of Hell"" is 2 hours of my life I WILL NEVER GET BACK! ...it should have been a comedy for having such a poor story. This movie even had some good actors and actress in it. Wow, very disappointed and on the brighter side I didn't buy it."
2,"Great cast, bad movie:","I am a huge Dwight, Billy Bob & Vince fan, along with most of the cast, but this movie was bad- as if I had written & directed this movie. The story, editing, sound, music (Xylophones???), etc. This flick was even hard to watch as a joke, and believe me, I tried real hard to find something to like here. I'd have to say ""Painted Cowboy,"" staring lead man Dwight, was a 5 star compared to this mess. I have got to cleans my mind and watch Sling Blade again, I'm giving South of Heaven, West of Hell 2 stars for the cast.Hey Dwight, I'm still going to watch your future movies, I know you are loaded with talent, so just hang in there."
3,ROFL! A Treat for Bad Movie Lovers,"Move over, ""Terror of Tiny Town""! It looks like we have the most exploitative and unintentionally farcical gimmick Western ever right here. This is either an exploitation movie trying to pass itself off as an art film, or an art film with a bunch of sex, gore and violence crammed in it to attract a certain audience (a film student could write a paper comparing this to ""Caligula""). But, puh-leez! With bad lighting being passed off as ""noir"", Billy Bob Thornton playing his role with his hand cupped over his mouth, singer Dwight Yoakam unable to direct, write, act, or even musically score his way out of a wet paper bag, and pretentiousness gushing faster than several characters' blood, no wonder the best review that interviewers could get from theater-goers was, ""It was...funny."" That, it certainly was."
1,It is an insult to bad movies to claim this is one of the...,"WORST of all time....but sadly, that is an understatement.Now I know why Dwight Yoakum hid out under that hat all those years....he's bald! Match that with his Barney Fife frame and he cuts one intimidating figure as a ""good guy"" Marshall who didnt buy into his family's whole death and dismemberment gig.Billy Bob Thornton's impression of Courtney Love is uniquely weird. And I used to think Vince Vaughn was cool...well, I got news for you Vince, maybe it's time for Swingers VI?I keep asking myself how so much talent could lend itself to such a historically awful movie. Well, blame Dwight. Maybe somebody a little higher up on the macho scale could have pulled this off, say somebody like Liberace or Truman Capote?Except for the features torturous 133 minutes, all in all a good DVD. Lots of extras, good soundtrack, commentary, deleted scenes too if you find yourself all that curious about this thing."
2,Semi-intriguing but lame.,"There are some very intriguing scenes here, mostly underdone, to include fresh takes on the western perspective, nice landscape shots and setting with potentially great characters, but the dialogue was diseased with an excess of modern day cussing/linguistics and as such was absurdly out of historical context - noted lack of enthusiastic acting/acting skills /enough to make this a lame sort of semi-intriguing unintentional spoof."
5,"Extremely cool film, even better D.V.D.","Kudos to Lion's Gate for adding all the bells and whistles to the D.V.D. release of Dwight Yoakam's paradigm-breaking, eclectic Western. This is a film that really shines on D.V.D., enabling all of Jim Glennon's stunning photography to shine, and all of Yoakam's tongue-in-cheek bits to be fully appreciated. Rank this one up there with ""BRAZIL"", ""FARGO"" or even ""BLADE RUNNER"" for sheer balls and uniqueness. However, if your I.Q. is skewed towards Jerry Springer, you'll completely miss this film's brilliance. E.G., George W. Bush won't get it... but independent thinkers will, and they're in for a treat!"
1,what an awful movie-do not waste your time,"Has to be one of worst movies of all time. Dwight Yoakam is a worse actor than he is a singer. How he ever got the cast talked into this one is beyond me. How can any person rate this above a 1?? I realize that even sh-- looks good to some, and that is what this movie is."
1,"This movie went South, straight to Hell right from the beginning.",The dialogue is artificial. The acting is ridiculous. The photography is beautiful. That's the only good thing about it.Don't even rent this one.
1,Total waste of film and time.,"Inspite of a all star cast, this movie was filled with profanity and a waste of my viewing time. The story made no sense, the language was vulgar which I don't mind, but this was senseless. I did enjoy the graphic sex, but I could not see where it did anything to further the plot, other than to get people who only watch R rated movies to rent it. Dwight Yoakam should for sure keep to singing and I hope did not use any of his own money to get into this film."
1,Nonsense.,"I enjoy many different types of film, given that they have some kind of plot and good character development. This film had neither. I had little or no interest in who was being injured or killed in the scenes of excessive violence. The good thing about the violence, however, is that it gave us a break from the inane dialogue.I am upset that I wasted 2 hours watching this pointless drivel."
3,"Strong performances, weak story line","This is not on my buy list, but well worth renting. Strong performances by Bud Cort, Paul Reubens, Terry McIlvain and others cannot overcome weaknesses and gaps in the story line.It's a wonder the movie was ever made. The director's track reveals that funding dropped away after ten days of shooting and that the movie was completed in a total of 29 days. Yoakam co-wrote the sceenplay, directed, starred, and wrote the music for this. Makes you wonder what the movie would have been with another month of polish."
5,Talk about a pounding!,"People really didn't like this movie I see. Luckily I watched it despite the criticism. I like to think of these actors as my type of guys. Dwight, Billy Bob, Vince and hell, even Buck Owens had a hand in it. I thought it can't be that bad if all these dudes are involved. It isn't. Actually, it's a pretty darn good western (I gave it 5 stars to off-set the negative but I rate it 4). It's set in the early 1900's so it's the end of the cowboy era. The thing with this movie is that it has a ton of black comedy that many persons won't get. If taken seriously, you're out to lunch. Personally, I don't care why people hate it, I found it different on so many small levels that overall it made for a unique, and good movie."
1,Not From Hollywood,"I note that the only person who apparently liked this movie was a ""reviewer"" from ""Hollywood"". Not surprising. Probably was entered by Billy Bob. Truly this movie is a terrible waste of time and is without any redeeming qualities. I would rather watch Costner's Wyatt Earp 10 times in a row (and that movie truly [stinks] too) than watch Dwight's movie once. Perhaps it had something to do with hearing the word F*@K 200 times or seeing gore that's usually reserved for horror movies. Perhaps this movie is aimed at the 18-25 year old crowd who will actually pay money to watch mindless sex and violence for its own sake. If so, they should have had some young actors like in American Outlaws. I recently saw that movie also and laughed and had a good time. Dwight should stick to bit parts and making music. And... this is important... keeping his hat on."
4,"Interesting features, worth a look.","I am not really a fan of westerns, but this is different. Slow-moving, but interesting. A variety of characters. I would watch anything that Vince Vaughn is in, but Dwight Yoakum is impressive. The cinematography is different, too. Everything is bathed in golden light, almost a dreamy look. This film is worth watching."
3,Road To Bali Madacy Edition,"Don't get me wrong-I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I just think this particular Madacy Entertainment 2001 Edition is crummy and thats why I rate it a 3!! The extra features are great and the sound is OK, but the print is bad-mine is blurry and it is not my player. I question the other reviewers here, what with this particular road flick available in so many different offerings on Amazon, they may very well be referring to another one and not realize it. You get what you pay for on this cheaply priced one. I recommend one of the other editions. Check them (their reviews)out first before purchasing this one."
3,Slapstick with a Setting Reminiscent of Gilligan's Island,"Two comedians entertain us. While traveling, one sleeps below the train (risky!). When playing on bagpipes and in Scottish suits, they kick each other. There are other humorous scenes throughout this flick.They land on a tropical island somewhere in the southern Pacific Ocean. Each one assumes that he will be the one to marry Princess Lalah. And, similar to the characters in Gilligan's Island, they have to deal with such things as wild beasts (in this case, the affections of a gorilla), natives and their poison darts, an angry volcano, and the imminent prospect of being beheaded. So who actually gets to marry Princess Lalah? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it."
4,Road to Bali 1952,"Bob Hope (1903-2003) and Bing Crosby (1903-1977) and Dorothy Lamour (1914-1996) team up their Sixht ""Road"" picture . Road to Bali , which was the only film in the series to be shot in color . Hope and Crosby stars as two out-of-work vauville performers who are on the lam . The two are hired by a South seas prince as deep-sea divers in order to recover a buried treasure .They meet beautiful Princess Lala (Lamour) and vie for hear affections . Of course,the boy run into the usual perils such as cannibals , a big squid and nomerous cameos from some of Hollywoods biggest stars . Director Hal Walker (1896-1972) was no stranger to the three actors , having directed the trio in ( Road to Etopia 1946) . The final ""Road"" picture (Road to Hong Kong 1962), would be released 10 years later with Lamour only making a brief Cameo appereance . This Movie are a gem and the only edition transfer in high Quality , there is several released version , this is the best ,Highly recommended"
2,not full length film,"the original had a running time of 91 minutes!excellent road film,and I have them all in my collection,and love them all,but our favorite is road to morocco."
3,Vaudeville,"This is a somewhat thin plot overlaid with the motion picture version of vaudeville routines. There are asides to the audience, and guest appearances in cameos, e.g., Humphrey Bogart, Jane Russell, etc. You have a bunch of the usual routines. It is a fun romp with Bob and Bing competing for Dorothy Lamour, and with a few bad guys, an ape, a volcano, etc. It's OK to watch, and has recently been on TV, but is not a five star production. It is lowbrow humor, about on the level of the Three Stooges."
3,A let-down,"The last of the main series of ""Road"" pictures, possibly the last by Paramount, and the only one in color...which doesn't add a thing, because it's also the worst of the ""Road"" pictures. Whereas the preceding four were ingenuous in their in-jokes and silliness, this one is forced and entirely too ""nudge-nudge, wink-wink."" There are cameos of their friends, like Bob Crosby, Humphrey Bogart and Martin & Lewis and Jane Russell and several others, probably. The songs were entirely unmemorable. In fact, I can't think of one of them! Probably the best in the series was the previous ROAD TO UTOPIA, or maybe ROAD TO MOROCCO. By now, it was petering out. Only one remained, much later, and without Dorothy Lamour."
4,"When I grow up, i want to be a producer like Fat Jon!","can't let another day go by without writing about Fat Jon. I discovered his sound by accident. Actually, while buying some vinyl records online, I read a review about his production and took a chance on it. This is the bomb right here! In a a hip hop world where originality has faded to black, Fat Jon's style stands out from the rest. It's smooth beats to say the least, a laid back, mellow vibe perfect for late night drives on the Autobahn. Check out ""Mystery God"" and ""Beyond Love"" which are (in my opinion) two standout tracks on an exceptional album. If you're longing for vocals, this may not be for you. Let me mention that Fat Jon did some production work with a ""neo-soul"" artist named Venus Malone. Although very hard to find, that collaboration is worth looking for. Beat connoisseurs will have a heyday with Lightweight Heavy. It's sure to please!DJ Come of Age"
4,Buy Volumes 1 and 2 first,"Mushroom Jazz III has a lot of great tracks, but if you haven't listened to Vols. 1 and 2, please do yourself a favor and buy those first. If you are a deejay, buy the vol. 3 compilation on vinyl for your own mixing pleasure, but frankly, though many other people here think the mixing is outstanding on this volume, it doesn't even come close to Vols 1 and 2. For Mark Farina, there are a couple sloppy mixes, and poorly conceived transitions, particularly with the Slide 5 and Herb Alpert tracks. For more, read my review on the Undergroundfiles.com website"
3,Snooze Time. Music for hip dinner parties.,Not completely awful. Actually it's worth a listen if only for the fact that it mantains a level of dull mediocracy for a full sixty minutes. I suggest you use it for the first course. You might want to jazz things up for the main course.
2,...i jus cant be pleased sometimes...,"...i played this all the way thru the day i got it...i played it sparingly the next day...and later that evening i took it and my receipt back to the 'wrecka sto' and exchanged it for a copy of atcq's 'low end theory'...five years ago i woulda been all into this, but nowadays, i jus be sooooo closed-minded....sorry...."
2,"close, but just not right for anything","Purchased for a week-long trip in Irelend. Unfortunately, couldn't find an Ireland atlas we were interested in.The scale is the key, and in this instance, we felt it didn't give enough detail to even figure out when we were approaching roads we could see. Finally, we gave up and used maps in the tour guides, which tells you how desperate we were.When driving, we'd find that none of the roads listed in tour guides were to be found in the atlas, which was a problem. We'd also have trouble with very inconvenient spots where one map would end and the next would begin (either because of the binding or the need to turn a page).I've used a lot of atlases and maps, and this one just didn't seem to do enough for us to be helpful."
2,Decent - same as harbour freight tools for 59.99,I have this same kit - paid 59.99 from Harbour Freight - pay the extra to get solid carbide edges - a good kit but the edge didn't seem to hold up for the 6 panels I wanted to make.
3,skipping,"I know this CD was used, but apparently it wasn't listened to before sending it out, as it has a song midway that skips and won't play. It is annoying. I won't buy from them again."
2,Illegit product?,"The first several tracks on the CD have the song title and artist offset by one. So when you play it in a modern CD player or load it into iTunes, the tracks are mislabeled. For example, track 3 has the name and artist for track 2. The company is in Argentina. I think that it's just a bootleg copy that was burned poorly. The songs are all there though."
2,Lacks detail,"As the book covers several models and engine types and is only 265 pages I found it lacked alot of detail.First section I checked was the rear susupension as I have an issue with the self levelling system on my 280CE.Unfortunately the manual only covered checking the oil level.Not good enough for a ""workshop"" manual."
5,Very Useful Book,"Covers just about everything but the WUR (warm up regulator) and no decent vacuum diagrams, but still an awesome book for gas engine W123 Mercedes owners. Even useful to diesel W123 owners, except for the fact their engines aren't covered."
2,Disappointed,I agree with most of the drawbacks mentioned by the other reviewers. I disagree with most of the good reviews. The propane output is pretty low and this is only so-so for smooth top grilling. It is quite large fo the cooking space. It is not a good home grill replacement and a lousy traveling option. I too bought a Weber Baby Q for my portable needs and it works much better. I put a griddle on it when I want to smooth grill. The thing arrived with a broken side tray besides.
2,It's OKAY but.......,"My daughter got this for camping etc and it is really nice, good looking, but... I bought the (about the same time and for $20 more) the Coleman Road Trip. Not for camping, for use on my small deck in my condo...it by far outshines this one, for instance 20,000 btus..two burners, two spaces for- and comes with, one grill for one side and one griddle for the other. You can get extras for $20 each. I have orded an additional grill so i will have that for most of the time grilling and the griddle for grilling veggies, shrimp etc. I got the optional large tank adapter as u an using it for a full time BQ at my house."
1,"Ugh, this thing is terrible","Where's the heat?! Where's the flame? If you like cooking hamburgers on a frying pan, this is for you? If you want flame broiled burgers and hot dogs, stay away from this. I got rid of mine and immediately bought a Weber Baby Q for the same price as this thing and it's an infinitely better product."
1,"Should be entitled ""A Brief Encyclopedia of Iberian Culture""","Unfortunately the authors have no idea what the word ATLAS means (this seems to be the case with most recent so-called atlases that I have seen). Although there are a few maps, anyone who was hoping for an extensive series of interesting and detailed maps will be sorely disappointed."
5,great score,"I need to know for sure before I buy the CD, is the song on here that has the foreign vocals, it is the part where the 2 men are getting ready to do the torture? If so, great!!"
4,the limit is only your imagintion,"to be able to go back in time and either go up against butch and sundance ,or be able to join the ""the whole in the wall"" gang is just one the reasons I play."
4,Nice soothing music,"I love the sound of Vienna Boys Choir but would like to find a Christmas CD that has more of the Christmas songs I grew up with on it. Such as Rudolph, Here Comes Santa Claus, Jingle Bells, It's beginning to Look.. etc. Although they have beautiful voices would like to hear them venture off the orchestral path and sing the way families do around the piano.Still a great CD worth the purchase."
2,Movie Review,"This movie does not hold ones attention, although the story is good, it is not very exciting."
5,Not Just For Kids!,"Young Hannah Marie's best friends live in the spooky town of Fright Side, a place filled with vampires, werewolves, and other ghouls where it is perpetually Halloween. It's definitely a scary place, but luckily she has her Scary Godmother--an only slightly eerie guardian--to help her through! With this home video release, which is ideal for any time of year, eye-catching computer animation is used to bring to life the beloved series of children's books by Jill Thompson. Grown ups will love it as much as kids."
5,perfect halloween movie,"I love this movie, its so adorable and full of the halloween spirit!I always watch this on Halloween while , I eat some yummy halloween foodies.I love the Scary godmother and Buggaboo!"
4,Cute movie for children,I went on a search for this movie as well as its sequal after my 3 yr old daughter watched them last year during the ABC family 13 days of Halloween. I originally DVR or TiVo the movies. I ended up watching those movies over and over again until I had to erase them in December to make room for the christmas theme movies. The movie is a cute halloween movie that can be enjoyed as a family. There is a cute plot in which the movie can be used as a learning lesson for children. It was a relief to find a movie that is kid friendly and my children can watch.
5,love it,They need more cartoons like this.I love how the frightside is so brightly colored and how hannah gets the big kids back in the end. A great little movie
3,Nice to add to your Halloween DVD Collection,"Our granddaughter is 3, and I thought she might enjoy watching a Halloween DVD with a small girl as a main character. She has enjoyed it but not as much as some other Halloween stories.Our computer animator sons were appalled that we purchased it as they claim the animation, lighting, and backgrounds are very poorly created."
2,Not that great,"Most of the reviews were pretty good on this. My daughter is 3.5 years old and I felt this was way too young for her. I feel she is pretty intelligent, but all the reviews said they had kids about this age and the cartoon/story line is ridiculous. My daughter watched it for about 5 minutes and was bored out of her mind. If you're looking for a fun Halloween movie for your kids, this is not the one. No matter what age in my opinion."
4,Epic journey by an unsung American hero.,"First hand account of pioneers crossing the American west in 1849. Epic and heroic in scope, Manly describes hardships and an America nearly lost to history. Where it survives is in the deserts and wastelands of Utah, Nevada and California.One will never be able to travel these regions without thinking of Manly, Rogers and the Bennet-Arcane party."
2,Caution,Be careful if you unscrew the unit because i did that while i was cleaning mine and the glass fell out onto the floor and shattered in a million pieces.The glass is not attached to the carafe.
4,Great-Looking...With One Caveat,"This carafe gets plenty of attention and compliments from guests and, since I keep it on my counter all morning, I'm very pleased that it looks great. It keeps my coffee hot, as intended, but the only caveat is that, because it's rounded, you have to be careful to drain it well by almost holding it upside down when pouring and when cleaning."
2,Dried tomatoes slices,"I didn't care for the taste of these. I wanted to love them and use them as a ""chip"" substitute but it just didn't work for me. You do get a lot so I will use them in spaghetti sauce."
3,Relaxing DVD,"I purchased this DVD from about 3 years, and that was before the blowing up of DVD market. I was looking for a Santana DVD, and it was the only available one.It's a special style of relaxing music accompanied with amazing nature video clips. the idea is good, but it needs very special occasions to be viewed.The picture quality is superb, but unfortunately the audio was set to stereo, which didn't complete the package. I think a 5.1 channel format surrounding the listener with those beautiful clips could make it surely better."
4,Intriguing neurological case studies,"Dr. Klawans articulately presents several more neurological case studies in this follow-up book to Toscanini's Fumble. Not all of them involve his own patients - some discuss historical figures such as Isaac Newton or the biblical figure of Joshua. Dr. Klawans' thorough studies and insightful commentary make this enjoyable reading for medical professionals and laymen alike. I think it slightly better than Toscanini's Fumble, even though both are occasionally given to hubris and a little too much self-certainty. The chapters are not too long and the writing is crisp, so this would make a good Christmas or birthday present."
4,Further tales of fascination,"Here Klawans presents another batch of interesting tales of interesting patients with some speculation from his part as to the mechanisms underlying the disorders. We meet famous people (like Newton) with possible diagnoses, well people with no diseases and a young patient whose treatment sheds light on the relevance of guinea pigs' jumping when one gives them too much serotonin.He writes for the lay audience, but there is much here to interest the professional reader too. Recommended for anyone with an interest in the function and dysfunction of the brain.dr_sasp"
1,Not really kundalini yoga,"Even though the rental was only 1.99, it was too much. This dvd is a mix of hatha and kundalini yoga. The instructor gives so much posture corrections that it took away from the spirituality of kundalini yoga. Skip it."
3,A propaganda novel !,"The writing is good and the story is gripping. But one should not forget that the author was given the task of writing this war novel by Poincaré, who was French president in the years leading up to the first world war. This novel was designed as a partisan, pro-French, anti-German novel right from the start. And indeed, its analysis of the responsibilities for the first world war are black-and-white: the phillistine and war-mongering Germans on the one hand, the peace-loving French on the other. Such a depiction might have been right for the second world war but it wasn't for the first. In 1914 France was eager to wage war to recover the two provinces it had lost in the 1870 war. For a non-biased impression of the first world war I recommend Verdun, The Prelude, The Battle by the French writer Jules Romains."
2,"Decent the movie, but worth watching only for comedic value","This English dubbed Japanese movie is probably done as best they could under their low budget, but it isn't very interesting nor entertaining. And to buy the premise, you'd have to have a near-zero scientific IQ. Burning all the rocket fuel ever made wouldn't budge the earth, and even if it did, the Earth's rotation would mean the Rockets are pushing in a different direction as the day progresses. And the moon being destroyed ""saving"" them? That's hilarious! Without the moon the earth would be knocked off its axis and most, if not all life would be destroyed."
2,This book was okay,"The pictures in this book were too cartoony and 1990s for what I was looking for. I was hoping for a look at more of today's videogame characters as I thought it would help out my brother with his drawing and computer illustrating techniques. So, unless you are looking for old school cartoons, you do not want this book."
3,Bible Stories,"Content was probably cutting edge when it was written--about 15 or 20 years ago. Now, stacked alongside contemporary curriculum for mainline Protestant churches, it looks, sounds and feels dated. The ideas were well presented and interesting, but definitely past tense."
4,ive been looking for this cd for the longest!,and i finally found it. i love this cd! i cant believe all her other cd's are availible and they stop making this 1! my favorite tracks are 'turn down the lights' i'll be there' and 'somewhere'....this cd iz defiently worth your money if your a shanice fan! ...
2,I love Shanice and her voice. But this is bad!!!,"It's not even average. It's below that! There are a couple of tracks that are not so bad (like 4) and some average tracks and a couple of terrible ones. The weirdest thing about this CD is actually the production. Like I said some of the songs are nice but most of them are either bad or have horrible, quirky beats. I can't believe Motown released this. I listened to samples of Shanice's 2005 CD and I didn't like that much either but it sounded better than this crap! Get Shanice'sInner Childalbum (it's bangin'), her first CD, ""Discovery"" (heard it was really good) or her self-titled album, ""Shanice"". Those are better offerings than this mess. Skip it at all costs!2 stars."
2,Didn't like it 10 yrs. ago--18 to 19 producers on it?!,"I love Shanice's music, but I didn't like this album 10 years ago, and still don't. It started the trend going now of the 18-19 producers crammed on one album. She had too many on there and the album dragged as a result when I listened to it. I nearly fell to sleep in the middle. Some numbers sound too slow and slushy. I liked Turn Down the Lights. But that's the only strong song out of a stale album. I don't know why she didn't have just R. Kelly, Jam and Lewis and Babyface on this album instead of cramming 18-19 producers that gave her some bland songs, some dull material and songs that just don't match with her very great voice. She was excited about turning 21 for this album, but the album didn't sound like it to me. No wonder it bombed so badly. Her '91 album was much better than this and the '99 album was far more superior. This set the standard for some uneven-sounding R&B albums during the '90s.Disappointing!"
3,Between Friends,"Being an avid fan of Debbie Macomber, I must admit, this book is not my favorite. Given that, I still like it. It is a compilation of letters written to friends and family which is quite different from Ms. Macomber's usual writings. Yes, I would recommend it."
3,"Lovely book about friends, recommended by a friend","Gentle story of two girls who remain friends for life, through all the difficulties each experiences. My first Macomber. I picked it up on the recommendation of a friend."
4,A great read for friends,"I was drawn in to style and format right from the beginning. Now that we are in the age of texting, letter writing has become such a lost art. Reading one of the letters from Nick to Jillian while he was on a tour of duty in Vietnam reminded me of my uncle's letters that I used to read to my grandmother while he was away in Vietnam. I loved the way you could feel the girls change and the character grow as they aged. Maybe some of the plot is a little predictable but still a very good read!"
3,Different,"I didn't expect this to be Diary after diary entry, I couldn't finish it, I found the pace slow and I hate to admit it, boring.Not her usual delightful book."
1,Between Friends,"I didn't think this was written as well as her other books, I stopped reading it about a 1/4 of the way through."
5,A Must Read,"This book was totally incredible. I don't think I've ever read a book before where the characters felt so real.I laughed and I cried right along with them. The story just seemed so lifelike, the way it paralled right with along with real events from recent history. Just please read, you'll be glad you did, when i finished it it left me with a good feeling in my heart. Debbie Macomber definetly knows how to show the beauty of a friendship like no other."
3,"Good, not great","I've read a large number of Macomber's books (not in any order, just as I found them). When the Kindle editions of a couple of her series came out I read them, which meant I re-read a few I hadn't read in years. They stood up to a second reading.Not so sure about this one. Once will be enough. Bit too much of life's sadness and tragedies for me, considering they all happen in the lives of very few people who all surround the two main characters. It was just a bit much.Also, the current events/politics sometimes became tiring for me, maybe because of the format - it often came across as more heavy handed than the rest of the facts and feelings in a particular entry.Overall though, worth a read."
3,Between Friends by Debbie Macomber,"Usually I love Debbie Macomber's books, but in the book--""Between Friends"" It was hard to follow all thecharacter's lives through all the letters. I was disappointed with the book."
2,Try one of the authors other books,"I too am a contemporary of the two main characters, not only in age, but in upbringing. I have to think the author is a bitter fallen-away Catholic based on the content of the book. Very predictable and not much in the way of content. A lot of political and religious posturing througout. Not to my taste. Having said that I have read a lot of this author's works and liked most of them. She should stay away from politics and religion. You are bound to lose half your audience no matter which platform you take. This one turned me off so badly that it will be a while before I pick this author up again."
1,"Boring, flat and lacking.","A friend recommended this book for our book club. Honestly I zipped right through it quickly so that I could get it out of the way and get on to something better. I didn't like it at all. I grew tired of the unrealistic letter writing format early on. Plus, it is highly predictable, flat, lacked dialogue and content, and was filled with way too much drama. It is also filled with stereotypes. I also found it annoying how the author tried to tie in so many newsworthy events (pop culture, headlines, etc.) into the journals and letters. Too much like a soap opera for me!"
4,not bad,some times the author needs to maybe leave a little bit to your imagation .the book is not bad though
1,You can do better,"I'll have to agree with the other reviewers that the sound is good on this little mp3 player. That's about all the good I can say about it though. The user interface is not very intuitive and I could never get wma files to play on it - despite following the bare bones manual. I even tried customer support - their 800 number was disconnected and they never replied. Oh, well. I'm just gonna return it and use the money for an iPod Shuffle instead."
2,Don't buy this.,"I should have checked the reviews on this phone before purchasing, as I would have discovered that many people have experienced exactly what I'm going through now. The problem is that the caller ID works intermittently at best. If you're looking for a phone with caller ID, you will be extremely disappointed."
2,dont get this phone,"I got this phone May 2004. It worked great, at first. About 3 months after I bought it, It would die in 20 minutes. Even if I had it on the charger all day. I do not recommend this phone.Also, I saw it at Best Buy for under $10."
5,Pwetty Good,"Got one a year ago on closeout at MalWart for around $16. WIsh I'd gotten more of them. It has worked very well, better than a couple of similarly cheap V-Techs that I also got. Clear sound, usable buttons / user interface; LCD smallish but no worse than others. Compact charging station can wall-mount. Stubby antenna hasn't broken. Not too large or small. Belt clip. I like the metallic-blueish/black color design - personally, it makes me look a lot sexier than I really am. Th-th-th-that's all, folks."
3,"Would have been one of the best around, except for the A/M","This is really one of the very best cordless phones i have tried (among them AT&T and Panasonic), with very sold sound. Great features like allowing you to redial by just pressing one button, whilst you're getting the busy signal. Very 'ergonomic' handset, good LCD display (though not lighted), lets you know how long you've been on the phone etc. Plus the great feature they are sadly phasing out, 3 mailboxes, which is just what you need when you have roommates, or private/business calls.The only drawback I find is that it forces you to listen to ALL the messages before you get to the new one. If you need to save messages, this can drive you nuts.But if you do not save them, go buy this phone."
4,Very Cute,I purchased this for my charm necklace. My son is a cancer so I wanted something to symbolize him. I gave it 4 stars only because the cuts on the stones were very uneven but I guess you get what you pay for. It is a very nice size.
4,Nice,"This item was very pretty, my sister really liked it and wears it every day. Good quality and timely delivery."
3,"PRETTY, but small.","Just like the picture but smaller than I wanted. I sometimes, collect various crab items, this was to add to my Granddaughter's collection. But a little too small, otherwise pretty."
5,The perfect gift for a Cancer,"My best friend, of 30+ years, is a Cancer. I'd searched for 20 years for a tiny crab charm and finally found this adorable sterling silver, ruby encrusted, crab charm. She was delighted by it; and told me she'd been looking for one since she was a teenager."
4,Horrors past and traumas present torment a troubled family.,"As with other contemporary horror scribes, Hautala plays down a lot of the supernatural and monster aspects of his tales, instead concentrating on the human elements. Here we have a recently reformed family faced with tragedy both in its past and present. An enthralling and creepy read that, like other Hautala tales, backs an emotional punch."
5,Well I haven't red the whole book yet but...,But this book is absoulutely amazing I can';t put it down! infact its in front of me now! People who love books you can't put down and love the feeling of sheer terror I really sugest this book! It is broken up into pieces so you surely won't try and skip through and read the ending! You can't miss a word of it! READ IT! I love it! I'm going to read it over and over! It's that good!
4,Refreshing,"Usually the Hungarian Dances are best listened to a few at a time, but these genial yet vibrant performances are so utterly delightful that I never felt the desire to stop the disc during its nearly one hour running time! Urbanek and his Prague forces may not quite catch the fiery gypsy feel of some other recordings, but these relaxed while still vital renditions are a pleasure from beginning to end. Recording quality is equally fine.No notes of any kind are about the only drawbacks I can find for this issue, unfortunately that's the norm for the entire ""Passion"" series/set on Delta. Even with that caveat, a highly recommendable CD."
5,Excellent Product,"I moved back into my home after spending a number of years in Colorado after leaving all my furniture, etc. to fend for itself. After 3 months of being home, I developed chronic cough, phlegm, etc. and even vacuuming and dusting wasn't cutting it. So I ordered two of these, one for the front of the house and one for my master suite, plus a Austin Air Healthmate Jr. for the guest room. I couldn't be happier with the products. They are the best at what they do for the money which is about half of what you'd pay for an IQ-Air unit. Of course I did have the carpets shampooed also. But, I would definately spend the money on these again. Highly recommend for quiet operation, sturdy construction, price, and followup costs for filter changes."
5,This is the best air filter,"Hi...I ordered this cleaner but after consideration, felt it was too big for us. The company, Noel, was cordial, friendly, cooperative when I needed to return it. I feel the smaller one room version would be better for us as I'd also like to move it all around the house, including the upstairs. I did a lot of research and felt this was the best on the market. You buy the Austin, you've bought the best."
5,Austin Air Filer -- WORKS GREAT,"My wife has several airborne allergies, and she was getting upper respitory infections. Since we got the Austin Healthmate my wife has not been sick since. I will be buying another one soon so that I can have another one in another part of the house."
2,Gets saturated if used near Unfinished Wood,"I had this in my bedroom and after a few months having it on at night, mostly on medium or low setting, it started to spew out the smell of wood. I called to complain about this and they told me that I shouldn't have it near unfinished wood or it will fill up with the fumes. What's the point of having a filter then?!"
4,A Keeper,"We received the Austin 400 in the time promised. The unit is a hefty 45 libs,but easily wheeled around where needed.The bedroom was our first choice. We turned it on high an hour before bedtime. When we went to bed I turned it on the low setting.The noise was hardly noticeable. Aside from the air smelling fresh, the proof would be if during the night my wife wouldn't wake upwith a stuffy nose and have irritated eyes in the morning. Well neither happened, even with the room being quite large .(12x15) with12 foot ceiling sloping down to 8 feet. So like I said "" It's a Keeper"""
4,Great air purifier for a medium size apt,"I put this unit next to the air register for my central air/heat system in the living room so all incoming air would be filtered before it enters the vent to each room. My apt is around 1200 sq ft, with 3 bedrooms. This unit makes a big different in terms of air quality, as there is noticeably less dust around the whole house when it is on. We closed the balcony and windows to reduce smoke from the neighbors, and the HealthMate is very effective at removing any smell and all allergens. My wife and son has allergy, so this is a very helpful tool.The only complaint is the noise this makes. I can't watch TV with this unit unless it is at the lowest setting. But I need it at a med or high setting if it will serve the entire house. Its is fine at night, since it won't bother us when we are sleeping."
4,Good product and service but louder than anticipated,"This is a good product and the service was very good, but the unit is loud even on its lowest setting. I dropped one star because buyers should be clearly forewarned about this higher sound level somehow in the product description."
2,Expected more..,"We have had this for just about a month now after doing much research and reading of reviews. I am severely disappointed in its ability as an air purifier. We have 4 dogs and my home still smells like I have 4 dogs. The one thing this machine is great at, is its noise level. It makes a tremedous amount of noise. If that level was any indication of its ability to do the job, I'd have the cleanest air in the neighborhood. Definitely not worth the price."
2,Cat Smells,"I have cats lot's of them! So I went to consumer reports and found this to be a good choice for the smell, No Good My cats still stink LOL! On a serious note when I turn it on it blows a lot of air out and does help with smells but it only last for about an hour and after that I get the vacuum and have to clean the filter then it works again but I would have to do that all day and I do not have time. I have a old ecoquest that broke they want to much for their machines and to much to fix but I may have to brake down and fix it because that worked like a charm with smells but I have read it is not good for you to breath (something about ozone) I have to read more into that one.Long story shortHouse still stinks"
1,Bad Machine,"Purchased this unit from the merchant MoreQualityLessMoney and Fullfilled by Amazon. When we plugged in the unit, it emitted a foul odor that caused a pretty severe allergic reaction. Since the air purifier was supposed to clean the air and not make it unbreathable - this was not a desirable result. I am afraid that the unit's filter became tainted prior to shipment or was manufactured improperly. I cannot recommend this product and do not think I would be willing to gamble on getting a good unit. I think I'll write this off as a failed experiment.The only positive thing about this experience is the great customer service provided by Amazon. When I contacted Amazon, my customer service rep immediately e-mailed us a return authorization and pre-paid UPS label to return the Healthmate. I have been shopping with Amazon for a long time and they have always given me superior customer service."
4,Very educational,I want to be a vet when I grow up and this book was a very big help. I could tell my dad what was the matter with my dog before we even went to the vet. Anyone that has a dog should have this book. It helps.
2,Go to the vet!,"The book is full of medical terms and it always ends up with giving you that one advise - the smartest thing to do in any situation: Bring your dog (and your money) to the vet! I did not once got away with a useful hint at what I could do myself right then and there to help my dog. In my opinion, this book by vets is a thousand page legitimation of vets and nothing more. There much better books out there."
3,Good info.,"Good information, but would of liked more pictures. It does have many pictures but, I had a different book before Hurricane Rita that I liked better."
1,NEVER RECEIVED MY BOOK OR MY $ BACK FOR THE PURCHASE,"THE SENDER DIDN'T PUT SUFFICIENT RETURN ADDRESS ON THE PACKAGE SO WHEN I GAVE IN INCORRECT ADDRESS, IT WAS NOT RETURNED TO THE SENDER & SO THEY COULD NOT READDRESS THE PACKAGE TO RESEND TO ME. I JUST WANT MY $ BACK FOR THE PURCHASE,"
4,The book I should have it earlier,"The book covers every aspect which I want to know when my dog is sick. Of course it is not a text book for veterinary, but it help me to communicate with my vet to discuss my dog's problem, and to know my details of my dog's problem.I would like to recommend this book to every dog owner who wants to know more about your dog's healthy problem."
3,Home vet handbook for dog owners,"This book came in great condition from the seller. It's a dated book, but still, the informatiion is of value. I own two dogs and recently had to take one to the vet. While owning this book would not have changed the fact I needed to take my dog to the doctor, I could have read about her symptons first."
5,Undeniably the best,"I am continually amazed by the ability of the authors of this book to present clear and pithy, yet absolutely comprehensive, information about what seems to be the entire gamut of doggy afflictions. I have consulted it on numerous occasions and have always found answers, which were later confirmed by my vet. It's not just good science, this book is a model of how to process and present information to a reading audience. It's good stuff."
4,excellent resource,"This is an excellent resource. It is technical but in an easy to read format. Unfortunately, the pictures are few and in black and white."
4,Very complete guide,I suppose I was looking for more of a pet first aid book. This one goes well beyond procedures I'd feel comfortable doing my self.
3,Book is Great but ...,kindle ebook useless because not able to go to pages in index!!!!!!I returned it for refund and had to get hardcopy.
4,Dog Lover,I have not read a lot of the book but it is a helpful book when tring to determine a dogs illness.
4,Dog Owner's Handbook,"Very informative. Covers first aid, and covers symptoms and common treatments for many canine conditions. Has helped me to make the right decision when my vet was pushing for surgery for a hip problem. Because of what I read, I got a second opinion. Turned out, that the hip pain resolved itself after several months of anti inflamatories and supplements and has never come back.Good reference, when my dog had a bladder infection, I wasn't sure if my vet was gouging me with all the tests and meds. By looking it up in this book, I found that the tests were both appropriate and nessesary to ensure the infection was fully erradicated."
5,Amazing book,"I got this book with the intent to put it on a shelf and keep it ""just in case"". What happened instead, though, was that I started reading the first few pages and got sucked in and read (briefly) the entire book. It's not really meant to be read that way, but it's so informative and so well written, that I just stayed interested. I now know a lot more about how dogs work, and I'm much less worried about dealing with potential issues that arise."
4,This book has already paid for itself!,"This is hands down, the best book out there for dog care. For those hwo say it's not good for emergency situations, it's not ment that. That is when you should stop worrying about money, put down the book, and get your dog to the vet. My dog was suffering from liver disease and when he started to act a little strange and confused I looked it up and discovered he had ""Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)."" I was able to call my vet and describe his symptoms and explain that I thought he was HE and the vet gave us a prescription without having to bring him in. That right there was enough to pay for the book. It is written in a way that everyone can understand and is easy to follow. I only gave it four stars because it was missing some things that I was looking for, such as syncope and more in depth with kidney disease."
5,Awesome reference,I'm an Emergency Room RN and found this was just the book I needed for travel with our Airedale. I didn't want just a first aid book and neither do I want to do surgery on the pooch and this books falls nicely in between. I recommend it to anyone who has a dog and wants to take care of it.
5,Excellent dog medical reference,"I have identified and solved so many dog problems with this book. Its written that most can understand and covers numerous topics. Its one of a few books, that is so complete for the novice. Anyone with dogs needs this book!"
5,A must have for dog owners!,"This is a book every dog owner should have. Very detailed & easy to understand. I like the fact there are some photos here & there, just wish they were in color to see the details a little better. This is a very informative book that I truely recommend."
5,A must for dog owners!,"This book covers a great variety of problems-----is easy to read and understand. Very informative, even for someone who has had past experience with dog ownership."
5,"This book is literally a dog ""life saver""!! A *must have*...","I show and occasionally breed dogs. This book was given to me as a gift a year ago and in that short time it has already *saved* the life of a puppy, correctly diagnosed dog's ailments/problems and given detailed instructions on how to treat them, and was a great tool in preparing for and whelping our last show litter. Beginners can learn so much from this book as well as being an excellent reference for the more ""seasoned"" dog fancier too. The authors have that special feel for the dog as not only DVM's, but as avid dog lovers, exhibitors and breeders as well. HIGHLY reccomended as a **MUST HAVE** for any dog owner!!!!!"
5,Great Midnight Help,"This is a good, well written, and well organized book. There is a whole section on diarreha, including how much Pepto-Bismal to give a dog and other home care. This was invaluable when my dog got into something she shouldn't have eaten."
3,Hit me,"When I ordered the song, The description said it had 2 songs. It came with only one (""Hit Me""). Since that's the song I wanted, I didn't miss out on the phantom song listed."
5,A True Hockey Song,"I'm a big fan of Mitch Albom's work, and this latest collaboration with Warren Zevon was no exception. ""Hit Somebody"" is a great song, and we play it at the local hockey games all the time. A great tune to have around the rink."
2,Review of Hit Somebody (The Hockey Song),Dumb song....and I'm a huge hockey fan! I thought maybe this would be a good song to play while the team was on the ice (in between plays) but you'd only like it if you love bad country music.
2,Not your typical Hard Case,"After reading like 4 of them I was expecting something classic. What I got was a entertaining, well written book. So why am I giving it two stars? Well it should have been published under some other company or come with a better warning.As other people have mentioned, this book does not fit Hard Cases traditional genre. There is no ""real violence"". No twists, no turns, no robberies, no tough guys... Just one man conflicted about a possible murder told through the 3rd person.I ding it because it isn't tradiontal noir. It is a solid book, don't get me wrong. It just ain't a ""Two for the Money"" or a ""Fade to Blonde"".Sean"
1,Hard Case Bore,"If you've been following Hard Case Crime, you know they've put together a distinguished catalog of noir novels. One assumes their publication of a very bad novel by Stephen King was a deliberate mistake aimed directly at the bottom line. But there is no excuse for the Shubin book. There is no complexity, no twists, nothing going on beneath the surface, no surprises, no relationship of any kind with the traditional noir gestures. Anything suggestive of there being more going on than meets the eye, proves to be digressions that signify nothing. The characters are bland and unintersting and the plot almost nonexistent. A fifteen year old boy sexually abuses a twelve year old girl and then kills her. Fifteen years later he turns himself in and goes to prison. Big deal. If he had turned himself in at once, this book wouldn't exist, and we would all be better off."
3,A tribute to Hollywood nepotism,"Oh puh-leez, the only reason Hasbro made a figure of this nobody character is because they were forced to by George Lucas, whose son played the part in Star Wars III. So yeah, if you've always wanted a chance to encourage lame Hollywood nepotism, buying this toy is a great opportunity."
5,Quality Moog Parts,"I recently rebuilt my front suspension on my Ford Explorer, and wanted to replace the cam bolts with newer parts. These Moog cam bolts are quality construction and make excellent aftermarket replacements for worn original parts."
4,too precise,"I have a 12 year old son that can build anything he puts his mind on. He has been doing this kind of toys for a couple of months and the only buts that we con put on them is 1st you have to wait for each piece to dry before you attach it to the larger model ( it can take awhile) and 2nd after the figure is finished you obviously have to take great care while moving it because they are very fragile. but overall it teaches the kids to work with great care and be very precise with the cutting of the pieces, which helps them build their patience, and after they are finished they really feel proud about the hard work they put into the model."
5,Loved every minute of it!,"I am a huge Parks and Rec fan. This was a short season, but awesome non the less! I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh!"
5,Excellent show!!!,"This is easily one of the funniest shows on television right now. Season 3 hits a great stride, with solid character development and an enjoyable plot arc."
3,"Good, but the product wasn't in a new condition.","I received this item quickly which was nice, but the plastic that holds the DVDs was cracked when I got it. The DVD still plays and everything. I just wasn't in the new condition I asked for."
2,Bummer,"Tina Fey - throw Amy a line and get her out of this awful show. It's painfully bad, dimwitted and stereo-typical banter. I feel sorry for Amy because she is hugely talented and I hope this ends soon so she can move on to something that showcases her true talent."
5,"Half staff is too high, have some damned respect!","After a lackluster first season, Parks & Rec really took it up a notch in season 2. Every character became a fully fleshed out person to truly appreciate, especially Leslie Knope. Season 3 however just took the greatness of season 2 and just ran with it. Everything worked. There wasn't a bad episode in the bunch. What season 3 did was cement Pawnee as the best fictional TV town this side of Springfield. The depth and background of all the supporting and minor roles breathe so much life into this ridiculous little town. Parks & Rec is the best comedy currently on the air(with Community coming in a very close second.) If you ever had any misgivings regarding this show due to season 1, ignore it and head straight to 2 & 3. They are guaranteed to change your mind. Don't forget to watch season 4, this show needs all the support it can get!"
5,Funniest program I have seen in a while,"I just love the characters and the story lines - not something that ever made it to the UK, but glad I found it!"
4,Good for binge watching,"Is it high quality? no. Is it 'must see TV?' not a chance.What it is great for is passing an hour or so with 2 or 3 episodes. If you like SNL and the office, you've probably already seen this. If you haven't, you won't regret it."
5,SNAKEJUICE!,"The snakejuice episode is my favorite. I laughed out loud like thirty times! Ron Swanson is hilarious in it. Leslie and Ann are drunk fighting and it is hilarious. Also the ""dinner party"" episode and the blossoming romance between Leslie and Ben. Probably the best season yet!"
3,Previously released material,"L.A. Guns 'Fully Loaded' compiles music from the two albums that L.A. Guns did for Spitfire Records, 'Man in The Moon' (2001) and 'Waking the Dead' (2002). With L.A. Guns now on Shrapnel Records, obviously Spitfire was quick to license off these songs and milk them for a little bit more. The song selection is slightly unbalanced, with more tracks from 'Waking the Dead' (a superior album) being used.There isn't anything new on here, so if you have those two albums there is little use for this one. However, the price is nice and the best songs from those two albums are taken for this collection. The bottom line is someone who doesn't have either of the source albums will certainly enjoy the music on this collection, which explains the generous score. ""Don't look at me that way,"" ""City of angels,"" ""Waking the Dead"" and ""Beautiful"" are all excellent L.A. Guns songs."
5,"If your A Dwight Fan, you will love this!!!!!!!!","Dwight is one of the pure county singers left and this goes to show that. The songs are all orignal and have been relased previously, but to watch the videos is another thing. Very entertaining."
5,dwight yoakams music,I have watched this dvd many times and have shown it to many of my contacts and they have enjoyed it as well
4,"Not as good as the first, but a great setup for the 3rd","Don't come into this book expecting the same thing as in Crossfire. It's a good book on its own, but it ends a little abruptly and some of the action seems a bit drawn out, or maybe stretched too thin (not enough actually happening to justify all the coverage).However, once you get into Blind, you realize it was all just right. I'd definitely recommend."
4,Cute,"Very good looking cuff links will let you wear that dress shirt without mayor hassles and without spending a lot of money, still making you look very sharp!"
2,Pales in comparison to volume 1,"Having read volume 1 of this series and enjoyed it, I went ahead and purchased volumes 2-4. Unfortunately this is nothing like volume 1 because these stories seem entirely fabricated at worst or exceptionally embellished at best. Some are patently fantasy, others are fiction written by professional gay writers. A great example of the latter is Bingo (p.34) by Ryan Field. Not only are there common elements to another of his books, but the timeline makes no sense unless he started the relationship discussed when he was 7 years old. You'll also quickly notice that everybody is an expert at gay sex on their first run through. If you are simply after erotic short stories then this may be what you're looking for, however, if you want a book similar to volume 1 (whose reviews you should read) then I wouldn't bother."
4,Near perfection,"First of all, I agree completely with the previous review in that music has gotten to being terrible and unlistenable. Anyways, this CD could have included Please don't Judas me and Hair of the Dog. It says greatest Hits along the side fro some reason."
5,Tyro Jones,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long, long time. Very moving and beautifully filmed. Excellent. A must get and see."
1,Save Your Money!,"This CD sucks! There is barely any rhythm in any of the songs on this album. This ""mix"" was put together poorly so there is no flow between the songs at all. I hope that I have written this in time to save others from making a bad buying decision!"
3,3 star workout disc,"A workout disc yes knocks you off you feet funky fat beats no, I use it but not that much I like my workout music throbbing throughout not fall off in the middle to some silly disco beats."
5,Excellent cookbook,"This is the best low-carb recipe book I've found. Easy-to-follow instructions, inexpensive and delicious recipes abound in this book. Dana gives you lots of tips which help you think out of the box to alter ingredients for your taste/budget. I'd recommend this cookbook to anyone who is going low-carb."
1,I was disappointed.....,"I am doing a diet for Candida (and yes, I was actually tested for it) and all the recipes in here include tons of cheese and dairy and other stuff I can't eat right now. The recipes look good but to try to modify them, at least for now, the book is somewhat useless to me...."
3,500 Low Carb Recipes,"I was really excited about getting this book, but upon receipt I was a little disappointed. Was thinking of returning it, but it wouldn't be worth the shipping to mail it back."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!,"Simply stated, I love this book. I am not a great cook, so when I decided to do low-carb eating, it was challenging for me to find things to eat. I quickly became tired of bunless burgers, and the like!500 Low-Carb Recipes solved this problem for me. It has delicious recipes in a variety of categories, and most of these are very easy to prepare. My husband has actually said that since I got this book, I've been cooking some really good meals!The beginning portion of the book is very helpful, with a very thorough section on ingredients, as well as other useful information such as how to determine the usable carb count, low-carb specialty foods available and more. And the recipes! Suffice it to say that there really are recipes for chocolate chip cookies, cheesecakes, breads, etc., that not only taste good, but are healthy!I am still losing weight and, even more importantly, feeling much better--all while enjoying scrumptious food prepared with this book's recipes."
5,Try the Olive Soup,"This cookbook has a permanent place in my kitchen, if only for the miracle of olive soup.There is so much more, though. Her Cajun Skillet Shrimp, Heroin Wings and Kay's Crab Stuffed Mushrooms have become stardards in my home.There is real treasure to be found in the desserts, too. You might not find your ingredients in the baking aisle, but if you know where to look, your supermarket has them. The results are very much worth it. Try the Chocolate Mousse or the Cheesecake with fruit...If you're counting carbs, this is a simply terrific book to buy."
5,The best!,I love the recipes. The food is great even if you dont care about the carbs! My Husband doesnt even know he's eating healthy.
4,Buy your own!,"I am back in the kitchen! I LOVED to cook at one time, then I became a ""low-carber"". For over 3 years now it has been an effort to produce meals my family would eat and I could eat. I dreaded the every afternoon because I had to rack my brain for appetizing menus that satisfied everyone. The books I had were okay but not great. Along came Dana. I saw her on the Today show; then tried a few of her recipes from the show and web site. WOW! I immediately bought this book. Cooking is fun again. There has not been one recipe tried that my family has not liked. They are fun to cook, extremely flavorful and even my 9-year-old likes them.4 stars, I wish I could give this book 5 stars. The folks-y format makes the book just fun to read but the unconventional cooking style could be a little confusing for non-cooks. An example one recipe calls for 8 chicken breasts; not really it is 4 chicken breasts split (into halves).I will say one thing, I will not share the recipes, BUY YOUR OWN BOOK!"
3,Review: 500 Low-Carb Recipes.,"Not as good as I had hoped. I purchase this back when first began The South Beach Diet (During the low-carb phase), however when I recieved it I was dissappointed. It's a large book, with lots of recipies, and not single picture (that I can recall) of any of it's recipies. As a beginner to cooking healthier meals, it's more enticing for me to see some scrumptuous pictures of the some of the meals I'm going to be trying out as I head down the road of a healthier lifestyle. I may pull it out and look it over again one day, but for now it's collecting dust on my bookshelf."
3,Good cookbook but..,"I have several of her cookbooks and my only beef is that many of the recipes call for Carb Countdown milk. Well I haven,t found or seen that product in years. And she doesn't give an alternative which makes the recipe kinda useless."
5,Very informative,"Good resource for those who are watching their carbs/sugars. Very well-written and explanatory. Lots of variety, which can be a problem with 'low-carbing'."
3,recipe makeover,It was interesting but the recipes used things I don't use so I had to compensate but they were deliciousI found the soups extremely delicious and enjoyable
4,Life-Saver,"This book is a life-saver. Dana Carpender tells it like it is. If you're gonna do the low-carb lifestyle, unless you are extremely well-off and can afford lots of specialty foods like low-carb bread, you need to cook! And this book helps you do it. There are lots of great ideas in here, folks! This book is very informative and a great companion to her book &quot;How I Gave Up My Low-Fat Diet and Lost 40 Lbs.&quot; She starts out her cookbook with important information about ingredients and low-carbing in general. Of course she gives you the effective carb count in each serving, too. The only caveat, and the only reason I did not give it the full 5 stars, is that quite a few recipes seem to call for hard-to-find ingredients. That aside, I love this cookbook!"
2,a bit extreme,"This book is only for those willing to be pretty extreme in their diet changes - whey protein powders, coconut oil, almond flours, etc. I just don't see myself using many of these recipes on a daily basis unless I wanted to go extremely low carb."
5,GREAT,Another great low carb cookbook filled with recipes using everyday items. Everything is healthy and delicious. I love it.
5,great book,"this is easy to follow, understanding that real world cooks are not chefs and don't have all day to make something. Good practical advice and tips."
3,"Its ok, but not great if dieting to loose weight....","The book has some great recipes and the lists of what to buy are helpful - however, if you want to loose weight - you need to count calories also or at least have that as an option -- the recipes did not include calorie count so for me it was totally useless since I have to keep restrict my calories a lot (due to hypothyroidism)"
5,BEST cookbook available for low carb!,This is an excellent guide to healthy living. It is the best on the subject!
1,Terrible,"Recipes were not good. Book was in terrible condition...old and marked up. I prefer not to use ketchup in recipes, Not a book I would recommend to friends."
1,Not worth the money,"No way is this book worth $20, or even $14. It's a mish-mosh of recipes quickly thrown together to cash in on the popularity of lo-carb diets. The author is interested in making a few bucks, not in presenting you with good recipes.Some of the recipes are so basic and low-brow that they reminded me of my first days of cooking as a college student. Others were complete disasters. One of the reasons I bought the book was that it has several recipes for lo-carb breads. I went out and bought all the expensive, hard-to find ingredients and made them carefully according to the recipes. Not one of them was even edible.I've bought a lot of cookbooks over the years, and still enjoy buying a new one, but I will never buy another cookbook from this author."
2,"Quantity of recipes, not quality","While I have found a few good recipes, such as Heroin Wings, it is obvious that the author threw in anything to reach the 500 recipe count of the title. There are many recipes that are cooking techniques, not a true recipe. For example, there are 25 recipes for omlettes/scrambles that can be summed up in one sentence: Try adding leftovers or classic combinations to an omlette or eggs (ie fajitas, mushroom scramble).For a well-written, professional cookbook with many great techniques and unique recipes, try The Low-Carb Cookbook by Fran McCullough."
2,Pretty impractical,This book has a lot of impractical recipes that require specialized ingredients. I read some reviews that talk about no brainer recipes being in here and it was right....who really needs a recipe for how to make scrambled eggs?Not what I was looking for.
2,Why are the standards for Low Carb food this low?,"After all the great reviews I was expecting delicious results in the kitchen, but every recipe I tried was either bland and tasteless or downright nasty. I also found quite a few typos and it seemed like many of the recipes hadn't been tested at all, cook times were off and the proprtions of the ingredients in the recipes didn't work either. Just because we are on a ""diet"" doesn't mean we have to settle for second rate food! For a low carb cookbook from an actual skilled chef check out George Stella's books."
1,tell me something I don't know,"I returned the book because I found it to be worthless in my kitchen. It might as well be titled ""500 Recipes -- 450 of which you already know but I thought I would stick them in here anyhow"". I didn't need a recipe for mayonaise or instructions on how to cook shrimp. Instructions on how to make a chef salad?!?!? A whole chapter on different things you can put in an omelet? This book just wasn't worth the money and wasn't worth the space it would take up on my shelf. I was looking for NEW ideas. It might be helpful for someone entering a kitchen for the first time."
4,A view from the other side of the aisle,"I'm not on a low-carb diet myself, but many of my friends (and frequent dinner guests) are. I picked up this book because one can only grill so many steaks and salmon fillets before one gets bored - I can only imagine what it'd be like if those were my only options every night!This book has been valuable for me. It's allowed some variety in what I cook for my friends and so far everything I've tried has turned out well. While I don't agree that mashed cauliflower is a perfect substitute for mashed potatoes, the recipe variations show that this is a pretty decent dish in its own right."
2,Not impressed!,"My only complaint about this book is that many recipes call for artificial sweetners, canned foods rather than fresh, and other un-natural additives such as whey protein powder."
1,omg so horrible,"as soon as i got this cook book i made the first recipe which this woman raved that was so fantastic, and i have never had anything so absolutly disgusting in my whole life, this whole book is trash. sorry to be so tough but it really is, i am so sad that i wasted my money on this book"
2,What is the Point?,"Life without the sweetness is not worth living. This book is the answer you have been looking for in the realm of bringing that sweetness back into your life, without the evil carbs our society has us all addicted to. This book is a must. Also highly advised, the ""New Sex Now"" dvd."
2,Blah,"This cookbook does have a ton of recipes, but without any pictures, much creativity or inspiration, it doesn't exactly make you want to cook or try most of them. If you are simply looking for a collection of recipes without much bang, this should do the job, but it's not going to make you want to eat any of them!"
2,Artificial Sweeteners,Sorry.. but very disappointed In the use of Artificial Sweeteners in so many of the recipes.. especially the deserts.. In a healthier world we should be getting away from the chemicals.. It's only a matter of time till we find out what the latest man made sweetener is doing to our bodies.. I wish the author would have used another ingredient..
3,"good photography, it's nice to see the dish!","interesting, good read, recipes are easy to follow. nice to see another option for diabetics and low calorie conscience eaters"
5,Makes that low carb lifestyle flavorful!,This book is great! It has become my go to cookbook since I got it. Great recipes and information on products for low carbing.
2,"What, no calorie count?","This book got great reviews so I thought I found the perfect cookbook. Not so.First thing I noticed is that there are no calorie counts with the recipes. So, for someone who is watching carbs AND calories, I now have to figure out the calories myself. Second, some of the recipes are basic and the author even admits to that. Some of the recipes look good but, come on, one recipe is for an omelet with 2 eggs and some cheese. I paid money for this???"
2,"Should have been named ""Cooking for Dummies""","IF you already know how to cook this book is an ""insult"" - it's so basic it's laughable. Plus most of the more ""interesting"" recipes can be found online at any of several low-carb web sites. I also found that there were editorial mistakes - like the temperature which to bake a cheescake was eliminated. And mistakes on the author's part in which she does not indicate the size pan to use - which DOES make a difference in the final outcome of any baked item. The author also uses ingredients that are HARD to come by in her recipes without giving substitutes.All in all I was quite disappointed! But in all fairness - it would be a good ""starting"" cookbook for those folks who are lacking in the culinary arts."
2,Not really that good at all.,"Frankly, if you release a book that says ""500 low carb recipes,"" you expect something more creative than a series of obviously now-carb things (meat and salad? Mein gott!) and completely impossible-to-make recipes.I'm sorry, but I don't live somewhere where you can casually walk into a store and find yourself some vanilla whey protein/special protein mix that is required for 90% of the desserts in this book.Just get a real cookbook and substitute flour for soy flour/bake mix and sugar for splenda."
3,Some very good but some HORRIBLE recipes,I think they tried a bit too hard to come up with a bunch of recipes. Some of them are great and the books is well worth the money but some of them are pretty bad. I think like many recipe books people try too hard to write tons of them instead of writing less recipes but make sure the ones are good. I think it is a good buy but not an awesome buy.
2,Disapointed,"There is only one reason I gave this book a 2 star review instead of 1 star. It is because of the intro section, where the author talks about a low carb diet. Overall, there are too many unappetizing recipes, such as the 'Hot Dog Scramble'. Yes, that's a hotdog with scrambled eggs on it....gross. sMost of the recipes have cheese, butter, or a lot of oil. She also likes to use Whey protein a lot. I figured that I could cut down on those things...then...The killer for me...the nail in the coffin....her use of SPLENDA. Why oh why do people use artificial sweeteners?!? I wish I had read more reviews, because I would't have purchased this book.Not all of the recipes sound bad, but for me, few sound good. If you're ok with artificial sweeteners and odd food combinations, then this book is for you. Otherwise, think twice about purchasing this book. It's really not worth the money."
2,Disappointed,"I have yet to find a cookie recipe in this book which works! There is too much fat in the recipes, I end up having to add almond flour or an equivalent otherwise the cookies run over the edge of the cookie sheet. Very disappointed. Not thrilled with the meat dishes either, way too much creamy stuff in the ingredients."
3,"Simple, Good.","Some of the recipes are just common sense, others are things I wouldn't have come up with on my own. A good basic recipe book for newbie low carbers."
5,Delicious,"For Mother's Day, I made four recipes, all of them outstanding. Grilled Tequila Lime Shrimp was so simple and so delicious I will add it to my regular dinner repertoire. Same goes for Orange Salmon Packets, with this creamy, sweet yogurt sauce that would taste good on just about everything. I also made some veggies and a cheesecake. The cheesecake was not as good as the real thing, which is, alas, made with sugar, but it was close enough that I'll never miss the flour-crusted version.I can't wait to make the coconut shrimp and the scallops wrapped in bacon on spinach with walnut sauce. Mouth-watering recipes that are simple, healthy, and delicious? Who could ask for more from a cookbook?There is more. The book is well-written and entertaining, too. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
3,My Sociology textbook,I received this book within the time frame I was given. The book was in very good condition. Thank you.
3,Water reuse for irrigation,It's a useful book for those who are trying to make sense of the larger texts (or possibly just governmental guidelines) on water reuse because it pulls together information from a variety of influential sources and consolidates this into summary text and tables. A good starting point for those wishing to understand sustainable water reuse.
4,Great seat at the right price,"Britax seats deserve the wonderful reputation that they have. This seat is well-made, the cover is soft, and the bottom of the seat has some padding. The straps never get twisted, which is a quality that is highly appreciated. This seat is very large, and I found that it put my daughter up very high in our Prius, but it fit just fine in and Outback."
3,Trash Classic,"This movie is so trashy that it's really fun. Everyone in the movie has a completely different accent and listening to Warhol's pasty lisping Dracula on the search for ""Wurgins"" is priceless. This is a camp classic and a must-see to round out any Dracula afficiaonado's collection. Get your hands on this if you can. It's not a great movie. But it IS great fun."
1,HAM STROKER'S DRACULA,"I am amazed at the excellent reviews this movie received. Palance, who is perhaps one of the most over rated actors, delivers a ham handed rendition of Dracula. The look is all wrong, he would make a much better Frankenstein monster--without makeup. He does not exude the charm, the sophistication of Dracula as did Lee or Lugosi, but instead comes off as a semi-articulate thug in a poor version of evening dress. A couple of steals in this version from Return of Dracula and Horror of Dracula, but there's no blood to this vampire, just blah. Waste of time."
4,An interesting video/movie,"I suppose whether you accept this production as being good is mostly based upon if you can accept Jack Palance as Dracula. I find his characterizaton to be parts charming, horrifying, commanding, cowardly. I wouldn't put him up with Christopher Lee or Lugosi, but he's pretty good in the role. I find it interesting that all sunlight did to him was to more or less imobilize him.The extras include interviews with Palance and Dan Curtis, and are rather enjoyable, plus the European theatre trailer.It's worth seeing. Owning is probably for those who have Palance or Dracula collections.All-in-all, pretty good!"
4,Dracula,I saw this some years ago on the television and I really taught Jack Palance captured the role very well. His features alone were very realistic. He plays the count very well the atmosphere and the whole Gothic thing came together for this one very well indeed. One very noticable thing in Palance role is the love with Mina and Lucy. I don't think any other version captured the love interest as well as this one. Palance vunerability came accross very much. The locations and the scenes were perfect and the encounter with Van Heilsen played by Sir Laurence Olivier in the graveyard was very scary indeed.
2,Poor quality image for the first third of the DVD,"This was a disappointment. The ""day for night"" scenes early in the story are murky black. There are many scenes that are insufferably dark until about the second third of the movie. Also, either it is a trick of my memory or the ending scene with Dracula has been re-edited since its television broadcast (Jack Palance, as I remember, didn't 'accept' being impaled with such grace... he hissed and struggled... not so in this DVD. Was that a trick of memory, or has this DVD been reedited?)"
4,"review of stare, jr","The only thing different we do is.. after we miss a question, we continue reading the rest of the questions to see how many we remember."
5,Innovative and Fun,"Stare! Junior is one of the best kids games out there. I was pleased to see my daughter and her friends enthralled for an entire Saturday afternoon. The object is for the kids to stare at the game cards and then answer as many questions as possible listed on the game card about the image correctly. Kids really love this type of challenge. They also all get to participate because the kids must determine by re-examining the image whether the answers given are correct. The images on the game cards are delightful and the kids get a kick out of staring at them. Towards the end of the afternoon, I joined in and the girls only allotted me half the time that they have to stare at the cards. Needless to say, it became a great adult-kid challenge. Innovative and challenging fun!"
3,"Should be fun, but....","This game seemed like it would be a hit with my 7 year old and it started out okay. Here's the problem....with 4 players there is an awful lot of waiting around and if it's not your turn to guess or check the one guessing--it is boring! Too much down time. I don't know why the creators didn't come up with a way that everyone could be involved. Easy enough--have everyone ""stare"" at the card, and then take turns answering the questions. We ended up doing that, which made it bearable, but, sheesh--we had to create our own rules!"
5,Terrific family game,"This is a great game! This one is fun for everyone in the family (it's always nice to find one that the parents can actually enjoy playing with the children). Players take turns studying the details in pictures, then answer questions about them. When we play, my husband and I give ourselves only half as much time to study the picture, to level the playing field. We also let our nine-year-old study the picture herself, but talk through the picture details with our 6-year-old. It is a ""game-night"" favorite of all of us."
4,Good Game,This is a very good game but it does move at a slower pace than others so if you have a child (or adult) who gets restless this may not be your best choice. There is some down time waiting for your turn. This certainly challenges ones attention to details and the adults needed the full timer though the game suggests we get less time. Even my youngest (age 5) is able to play with the extra time he is alloted.
2,boring,"I just bought this for my 7 year old son. We both think it is pretty boring. I think the game would be better, if the cards made some sort of ""sense"" but, they are very random pictures...a shoe floating above someone's head, etc.I gave it 3 stars for educational value, because there is some reading involved...yet, I doubt we will play it much. It just isn't fun."
2,Thumbs way down,I bought 2 of these as Christmas gifts and was very disappointed. When you play the game you feel like you should be quiet for the 30 seconds the other players use to study the card. It's like taking a test in front of your friends and family. It's excrutiatingly BORING.
5,If a Six Stars'rate had existed...,"Absolutely Fantastic! Their first album was a total treat, this one is gorgeous: McCartney melodies, Wilsonian vocals, all that a pop lover would hope to find in a record today. Congratulations folks!"
1,Worst Puma design,"Low quality to be a Puma. My feet hurts when I use it for a long time, the disign looks different when you got the product in your hands."
4,"a little corny, but fun","I bought this while visiting Montreal to help me pick up the Quebec accent. It's great for beginning to medium french learners because the dialogue is easy and the atmosphere of the movie is fun. It's a little corny because they overact a lot in it and they say things like ""full cool"" a lot. It's also got an english track, but I haven't watched it in english yet. Worth a look (esp. used) if you're trying to get the accent!"
3,"this ""art"" fails to move me","Einherjer has all the goods that it takes to make a really good (viking) metal band. excellent musicianship, tight playing, big choruses, leather, etc. (their sound could be compared to Mithotyn) but there is just something about them that just doesn't feel right to me. i'm not sure what it is. these songs sounded great and got their hooks in me upon first listen; but the second time around, i could barely listen to it. there's an element to this band that feels a bit contrived...but i always have a difficult time trying to figure out what that element is. the bottom line is...Einherjer is a pretty good band, but there's many other bands creating this sort of epic ""viking"" metal who simply do it better. at least Norwegian Native Art is better than their last album Dragons Of The North...that was a real snooze-fest."
3,Not bad. Just very wacky/silly. And at times Goofy.,"I wanna start off by saying i think this film may have been originally filmed in the 2.35 aspect ratio, and then cropped for some stupid reason as several scenes have stuff on the side cut off, or at least it appears that way to me. If thats the case that was a stupid move. Anyway, this film isn't bad at all. Deray Davis is great as always along with comedian Jasper Redd, Charlie Murphy, J.B. Smoove and Bob Sapp are good too. I noticed that several scenes mainly The Basketball tournament and club scenes feature several people walking in front of the camera, or awkward zooming. The filmmakers didn't really know what they were doing it seems but its not terrible filming by any means. Just clunky. Check this out if you're bored and in need of a laugh or 2."
3,Some great songs!,Overall it is a good buy and I loved some of the songs...but others I didn't really like. Like the song he sings in remembrance of his mother...not exactly a song you want to hear while your traveling in the car.
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this CD remembering a time when I heard him at a local church, but is really disapointing, didn't like it at all"
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"This DVD contains newsreel footage from the early days of World War II, both on the home front and from the battlefield. Although the newsreels are informative, they are not what I was expecting when I started to watch this disc. I was hoping to see a documentary program about the early battles of the war, such as Pearl Harbor and Midway. Instead I saw footage about tennis matches and food rationing. I realize that these newsreels were made for the information amd morale of the American people, but I was hoping for something more from this disc.The one newsreel I did enjoy was Abbott and Costello's famous ""Who's on First"" comedy routine. If you enjoy informative newsreel footage, then this disc is definitely for you. If, however, you were looking for a documentary about the early days of the war like I was, then look for a different DVD, because you won't find what you're looking for on this disc."
3,"Not too bad, But Not Best","I bought this hot pot and When I received it the steamer was a little bent, But not badly. Steamer is flimsy not very heavy metal wouldn't take to much to bend it. Its nice at first glance But there are a couple of things. One is that its Got a Teflon Non Stick Pan(Huge Sticker That Says TEFLON) and I hate Teflon Because its very bad for your body if you ingest it, And it's made from very light plastic for the unit it self.It does seem to cook evenly And It comes with wooden paddle and warranty card and instructions. I usually Buy Zojirushi brand allot better quality and I love Japanese made cookware and appliances, they hold up allot better. I would recommend that anyone Buy another brand and Stay away Form Teflon. I would recommend buying Zojirushi Brand for Appliances and other small things, I have several of the Zojirushi and they are allot better made."
4,Pilgrim in Love,"I rank this up there with Helen Luke's Dark Wood to White Rose, and Alan Jones' The Soul's Journey for insightful looks into Dante's Commedia. The different perspectives combine to give a neophyte student of Dante a good understanding of the message. I personally was amazed at how much a man from the 1300's had to say to me, and how timeless are the issues we must face as human beings."
4,Pilgrim in Love: An Introduction to Dante and His Spirituality,I own a work of art by Father James Collins and wanted to acquire His book which was out of print.
5,I thought I knew a lot about the Registry...,"Until I read this book! Jerry Honeycutt has done a masterful job of dissecting the Registry and explaining what it is piece by piece and how you can change it to make your system better, faster, stronger. There's even information for system administrators for remotely editing workstation Registries. The Powertools software on the CD it comes with makes a nice companion to Tweak UI, although it's not robust enough to replace it. This is easily the best Registry book that's ever been on the market; I'll never read Woram's book again!"
2,black?,"I bought this cd based on what I had heard in the previews on amazon, and I must say they are way too good for the album. Each song except for rust are hard to listen to for more than 30 seconds, because they are just power chords and screming, there is very little thought behind it, and it sounds like death metal, which was not what I was hoping for. Its not bad but for the black metal that we have heard from Darkthrone its a giant let down. Buy it only if u can listen to each song preview over and over again for 5+ minutes."
5,d-days in the Pacific,Remembering the many sacrfices on far flung beaches of the pacific. Well presented and not overdone.
2,"Some good, some atrocious","Disk 1 was great.On Disk 2, ""Admiral Chester Nimitz"" was great.I had recently seen ""The Bloody Hills of Pelileu"" in another collection.The ""General Douglas MacArthur"" selection is one of the WORST trumped-up fictional hagiographies using selected facts of Douglas MacArthur possible. It's given a little balance if you watch ""Admiral Chester Nimitz.""It's available on netflix."
4,another good offering...,"...from RFTC. Not as melodic as Scream Dracula Scream, or as heavy on the horns as that album, but plenty of straight-forward punk goodness."
4,good book,"This book first tells the story of Afra, who we met in The Rowan, and then goes on to tell Damia's story. I don't think that this book has the same plot as The Rowan at all, although there are a few similarities. If you were intrigued by Afra in the first book, you'll love him in this book. It was wonderful to find out more about him. Damia's childhood makes for an entertaining read, moreso, I think than the Rowan's. However, the Rowan was much more mature as a teenager and young woman than Damia. Teenage Damia is spoiled and annoying, and it's a wonder Afra could ever put up with her. That was one of the reasons I gave this book a four instead of a five. The other reason is that the whole Damia and Afra relationship seemed very strange. Afra never seemed to be very upset by the fact that he was falling in love with the same person he used to babysit. However, in spite of those two things, I really enjoyed this book."
5,A simple taste of magic.,"I give it to Anne for her wonderful ability to weave such a beautiful and detailed story of one girl, the daughter of the most influencial and powerful psionics in the terran galaxy, into something that captures the readers attention like no other. Damia is a beautiful character, both in soul, and apparently in body. It is hard not read this and not feel the rebel inside you again as Damia begins her childish exploits, or not feel the ache of parenthood wrenching upon you as you see the point of view of Afra. As if the magic doesn't end, Anne spins a furious web with the way she handles the love in the novel.....it is hard not to feel part of this novel......it's awakening."
2,Some issues with the plot...,I found this to be disappointing as sequels go mainly for what it did for the other characters in the novel. It is very hard to believe that the extremely strong-willed (and very maternal) Rowan would have shipped her older children off to be raised by their grandmother. It is also find unlikely that Damia's parents would so readily accept her relationship with a man old enough to be her father regardless of their friendship with said person. Basically an OK novel but not one of her best.
2,rehash,I LOVED the dragon rider series. 20 years ago I had read everything that McCaffery had ever written. Lately it seems like each McCaffery book I read is more of a disappointment than the last. This book is nearly identical to The Rowan. The plot is recycled. The characters are two dimensional. McCaffery doesn't put any effort into her writing anymore.
5,Classic dissection guide,"This lab dissection guide was written over 40 years ago, but it is still the single best guide to cat anatomy. Cats haven't changed, but modern textbook manufacturers think that their thick glossy expensive books are more appealing to today's students. They are wrong. This simple guide is filled with beautiful hand drawn illustrations that are more helpful than any photograph. I only wish it was spiral bound so I could leave it open flat while dissecting. Check out Gilbert's guide to the dogfish anatomy as well. Together they make a great set of manuals for any comparative anatomy course."
5,great quick reference,I am an anatomy and physiology professor who purchased this book as my own reference! The images and organization are excellent and most of my students enjoy this type of simplified representation over photos. Highly recommended for teachers and students alike for use on the cat and sheep brain.
1,VHS not DVD,"Ordered a DVD of this movie, but recieved the VHS version. I can't imagine how that could happen, who buys VHS anymore?"
4,Good reading,"Very informative, but a bit dry in places. Personally I like that, but another person may be put off by it."
2,not up to Webers standards,"The grill is up to Webers usual high standards but I do have a couple of quibbles with it. I bought the Q grill because I needed a high quality but smaller and lighter unit for use in my rv. Since every pound counts, the solid cast iron grill will probably not travel. But an even bigger problem was the lack of a non stick surface. I don't have the time nor inclination to ""season"" a cast iron grill. What I would have liked is a high quality aluminum grill with a non stick surface."
2,Do not buy this phone,"I bought this phone to replace a 900 mHz model that had poor reception. What a mistake. This one is by far much worse. The call quality is the worst I have ever experienced in a cordless phone. I've tried changing the channel, but I'm convinced that does nothing. The range is horrendous. If you venture more than 20 feet from the receiver, your call is completely taken over by static. It looks nice, that's about the only good thing I can say about it."
5,Simply the best!,"I replaced a Monster cable power surge protector with this Tripp Lite unit. It has a higher joule rating capacity and plenty of indicator lights so you really know what's going on with the power and watt usage. Best of all it is much cheaper than Monster. I use Tripp Lite surge protectors exclusively - I live in an area of frequent power surges and lightning strikes. I have had Tripp Lite protectors burn out, but never had any equipment fried. For example, the last surge that came through the neighborhood was caused by a telephone pole being hit by a truck. When that happened, a 19,200 volt line hit the 2400 volt line that supplies our homes. I lost six surge protectors but no equipment. And best of all, Tripp Lite is excellent on replacing their units promptly, they all are lifetime guaranteed. Buy their products with confidence."
3,Bio look at one of the most intense coaches in history,"Biographical look at one of the most intense coaches in basketball history. Musselman, who has coached at all levels, including major college, ABA, and NBA, and won a record four consecutive CBA championships, has relied on basketball smarts and an overwhelming, almost haunting desire to win. The book traces Musselman from high school to college to the University of Minnesota to the ABA, NBA, CBA, and NBA again."
5,CRAZY GEORGE SCHAUER - BASKETBALL ENTERTAINER EXTRAORDINAIRE HIGHLIGHTED,This book is an excellent early history of the NBAMinnesota Timberwolves' basketball team until 1988-1989.It details the life of the Timberwolves' coach Bill Musselmanfrom his childhood to his coaching years at Ashland Collegein Ohio where his team established a national record forpermitting only 33.9 points per game. This fine basketballbook then encompasses Bill Musselman's coaching yearswith the NBA Minnesota Timberwolves.I strongly recommend this delightful book for its veryinteresting and entertainingly unique chapter about the lifeof basketball entertainer CRAZY GEORGE SCHAUER who by the1988-1989 basketball season had already performed five thousandbasketball shows throughout forty nine states and fifteencountries outside the United States. The wonderfully talentedGeorge Schauer is a trick basketball dribbler and trickbasketball juggler.
1,Fossilized Customs,"It is obvious that White was trying to make a point- The problem being that his point was both erroneous and ridiculous- It is people like White that the Apostle Paul warned the churches about, calling them wolves at the door- This book is basically just another of many that attempt to Judaize Christianity- By the way, for those that claim to know the Fathers true name, were theyallowed to call their earthly fathers by his first name, or did you call him ""dad"" or ""daddy""?They should read Romans 8:15- In fact With White's perspective on the law I would really be surprised if his""Torah"" had a book of Romans in it."
2,The letter and the law,"Since ancient times Jews and Christians alike have confused the letter and the law, form and content. Lew White has continued in this tradition very well."
5,Divine Truth vs The Pagan Christian Church,"I read Lew White's 2nd edition of this same book several years ago and was astounded. With this newest edition Lew has outdone himself once again. Truth is rarely comfortable because it almost always requires self examination and genuine change if the truth is to be effective in your life, and I'm speaking from personal experience. This book is not for casual reading... it deals in depth with serious faith and belief issues and will set you on a corrected and righteous path. Want to draw closer to your creator in truth? Get the book!!!S.P. Abilene TX"
1,wish Amazon had negative stars,"OK, so I should have read more reviews.What I was expecting was a reference on the history of some of our religious customs and holidays.What I got was a rant on how Christianity got off track from the beginning, because it incorporated myths and rites from the older ""pagan"" religions.There are much better and easier to read books about old customs out there."
3,Interesting opinions in the debate about rituals,"I bought this book in part because I am fascinated by conspiracies and conspiracy theorists, as well as really curious as to what the author might say about Christian history and theology. In the first criteria, the book didn't disappoint; even as an accurate record of where many Christian rituals arose, it might be correct, although I am not enough of an expert to verify that. I hope no one reads this thinking that if one celebrates Christmas or Easter, which do have much in common with pagan ceremonies, one cannot be a ""true Christian."" Please, seek other more reliable sources if you are interested in this topic. On the other hand, one cannot say that Mr. White's observations aren't colorful and interesting.What is a terrible shame is the poor editing. Bits of chapters clearly belonged under other chapter headings and even in different paragraphs.Three stars primarily for entertainment, not edification, purposes."
5,most awesome book i have ever read. keep it with your bible.,this book opens your eyes to alot of truths. alot of things our sweet savior is talking about has new meaning after knowing this history and etc. i cant stress enough how important this book is for all to read. even if you dont agree with 100% it is still the most valuable info you can recieve. shannon
5,Changed the way I serve the Creator of all that is&is to be.,"Where do I start? There is more information in this book than anybody would expect. It points out the fact that pagan worship in any form is not acceptable to YHWH in any form. It literaly challenged what I have been putting my faith in all my life. I found out that I had put my faith in lies handed down to me by my parents and the ""christian church"" forefathers. It promotes the Truth in a ""in your face mode"". It does give Scipture references to all that is said inside. Not only does it use the Scriptures for references but it uses encyclopedia's, world history,books that you can get in any library to see for yourself ect... . It proved to me that everything has an origin from which it started. It showed me that the Truth has been twisted from its original form. It shows you from the Scriptures what the Truth is without much selling points. Either you see the Truth that is promoted in this book or you are not at home upstairs."
1,Slander against Islam,"I had heard good things about this book and probably agree with much in it, but when I finally got my hands on a copy I opened it up to the chapter on Islam. What an atrocity!The author claims that Muslims PRAY TO MARY! Actually they view prayer to any but the Most High as an awful sin.In a book that claims to set scriptural standards for believers in Yahshua, such slanders against Islam are only a continuation of typical Christianity's LIES.If the author is anywhere near as misinformed on the other subjects covered in his book as he is on Islam, I can only recommend you ignore it totally. Hopefully, he'll correct his errors in a later edition."
1,Full of lies,Seldom found more lies in a book. Good for making people more dumb and more superstitous. If there wouldn't be people who believe it it would be only something to laugh at.
2,ok,it is a ok book it should have been more professionaly presented... and with more notes to make research
4,I don't fully accept what's in this book,"I don't fully accept what's in this book, but I enjoyed reading much of it. Tracing the origins of many familiar traditions present today in religious groups, and we all should progress, restore, go back to the original faith."
4,You won't be able to stop reading....,"I also found myself agreeing and disagreeing with many of the topics in this book. I still recommend it to others as a must. It made me challenge my own excuse,""that was then"" or ""that was according to their time"".If we make norm an abomination, does it truly become right? Are we truly ""set apart"". I personally researched many of the topics and found them to be true.I also had the oppurtunity to visit a Roman Catholic Church(Grace Cathedral) while visiting San Francisco and saw many of the topics in the book staring back at me. It was like being on a field trip."
5,The best game!,"This is by far the best game I have ever played. Fun, Intelligent, and competitive - I highly recommend it. The questions are innovative and thought provoking. You will not be disappointed! If you thought you liked playing Trivial Pursuit, try Wit's End and you will likely never play Trivial Pursuit again. Wit's End keeps you thinking and on your toes."
4,Fun and challenging game!,Wit's End is a fun and challenging game for older kids and adults. We enjoyed playing it as a family and even just asking the questions without using the game board. Very enjoyable!
5,best trivia-type game yet,"I recently played this game with some friends and we had a terrific time. It's really challenging but the best part is that the answers are staring you in the face, so you are encouraged to work them out - much less frustrating than simply saying ""I dunno."" Lots of social interaction and competition too. The range of material is huge. Great game!"
2,We're not that dumb! Really!!!,"We bought this game for Christmas and played it once with a group of about 7 well-educated adults and were truly at our wits' end.The questions are ridiculously hard. Let me give you some examples:Aesculus is to Euripides as Ionesco is to________.Black is to Turkey as red is to______________.One question had a list of painters and asked which was not a Dutch Master. After much debate, we chose one, only to find that they were all Dutch painters, but the one that was the correct answer was a Dutch Rennaissance painter.So we gave the game away as a gift to someone we figured was smarter than we are."
5,Great game!,I bought this game last year and we ended up spending days playing it! One of the most challenging and fun games I've played in a long time.
5,"challenging, humbling, enduring","Trivial Pursuit on crack. That's all I have to say. Even the most shameless glory hound at the game table was humbled by some of the questions in this game. We've played quite a few times, and it continues to be a challenging, social, and conversation-inspiring time. Science buffs, literature geeks, pop culture mavens, sports fanatics, and history worms will all find a home here, and general-knowledge compilers will be hard-pressed to use all their powers to get through. Definitely not a game for the weak-minded, this game left more than a few players in the dirt. Play in teams."
2,It's not that great,"I put this game on my wishlist because I love board games (especially trivia games and brain teasers), and the reviews for this game were outstanding for the most part.But this game is boring. It takes for-freaking-ever to finish. You have to wait around while the other player reads his/her own questions. And it's cheap-looking.I suggest you buy another game. There are a million trivia games that are more fun than this one."
2,Don't purchase unless you ABSOLUTELY love trivia!!,"Wit's End is not worth your time unless you're a trivia nut!!!I have a weekly Game Night with friends and I recently purchased this game to spice up our usual game night routine. This game, however, was a huge let down, even though I had researched it thoroughly before purchasing.The trivia questions are definitely challenging and span back in time to even the 1800's. Even when you answer a trivia question correctly though, you don't necessarily advance forward, just another opportunity to roll. In fact, most of the time you might move forward one space just to fall back two spaces. It's very difficult to advance in this game which my group of friends found frustrating. Some of the trivia questions are reasonable but most were too challenging. This game is OK, but I imagine it would only be fun for people who are trivia wizards. Don't waste your time...."
2,"Nah, boring, difficult and not fun","I was most disappointed by the ridiculousness of some of the questions and the poor explanations. This is definitely not a trivia game, seems more emphasis is placed on word association, patterns, and other brain teaser-type problems. Really too difficult for children under 14. Not great for older adults either. Try something else, especially if your looking for trivia."
2,This game [is terrible],"I bought this game for my family after reading reviews ... on this. Every review was 5 stars, so I figured...hey this has to be a good game. Well don't waist your money! Although the questions are of a different nature, they are too ... hard to answer. One game took us all night to complete, and the only reason for that is someone got to move up a level to bring them to the top. Bottom line is unless your family are all brains then don't buy it!"
2,"Too hard, not fun","The questions in this game are extremely difficult. I was playing with 5 other well-educated, well-traveled, well-rounded individuals and it took us hours to complete the game. It came to the point where my team agreed to simply always guess B as the right answer."
2,"Like Trivial Persuit, only not as good","I bought this game for my sister because of the good reviews, but I regret it now. Some of the questions are hard, but a lot of them are pretty easy so you win really fast. We played two games and after getting a few really hard questions wrong, I answered about four easier ones right and won the game before anyone else moved. The same thing happened the next game, only someone else won in about 5 minutes. Its a bad knockoff of Trivial Persuit and that's about it. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend."
3,"Challenging game, but a bit dull...","My husband and I purchased this game because we were excited to find a board game that we could play with only 2 people. While the questions were challenging and really very good, the game itself was a bit dull.The game is pretty straight forward. You move around the board from the outside, and on certain squares you can move inward to a ""higher"" level. The goal is to get to the center first.I think the game would be more fun if the rules didn't specify that each person reads their own question. If the player gets the question right, he/she goes again. For us, this lead to a period where it almost seemed like each player was playing alone. Involving everyone in the questions would be better.Perhaps this is a game that we would enjoy more played in a larger group. Based on reviews, it sounds like most people play it in this fashion. Playing with only 2 players, I can say that it is not quite worth the price, but still an enjoyable game."
5,Wit¿s End is my new favorite game.,"My family played this game during a recent anniversary party for my parents. The questions in this game are fantastic -- Interesting, Intelligent and Informative! In a game centered around knowledge and trivia all you can ask for is that the questions do not make you roll your eyes with frustration. This game manages to ask great questions that interest all the players. You get to pick your favorite question type. The game revolves somewhat around lateral thinking which makes it all the more challenging and fun. You can&#65533;t go wrong with this one!"
5,Great Game -- You Can't Miss Having this one!,This was the best trivia and knowledge-based game I have every played. The analytical categories are superb and the range of knowledge is fantastic. We had great fun debating the questions and the answers are so detailed. This game is a blast and much much more different than other knowledge-based games out there.
2,a big disappointment,i learned a lesson after buying this game...REVIEWS ARE SO MISLEADING...a friend really wanted this game after he read the reviews for it...and man were we [upset]..this game is just loaded with SAT questions and pathetic trivia...it only took about 20 minutes to finish! do yourself a favor and spend your money on a more exciting game...like cranium for instance!!btw..out of the 6 people that played..only 1 liked it...need i say more...
1,Good for Test Preparation,"If you're looking for a relaxing evening of game play, DON'T BUY THIS GAME.If, on the other hand, you're preparing for college entrance exams, this game might be for you.In fact, this game should have been called ""Hooked on the SAT."""
1,Not for kids,"This totally bombed with my kids. I found it highly entertaining though. I do love jazz. But my kids (4 and 6) could not enjoy it. I wish that reviewers would check out what children think, instead of factoring in their own adult bias. There is nothing interesting in this book for a kid. No plot, no discernable subject...just cadence and rhythm. That is not enough to make a book fly for a kid (or at least mine)."
4,This Was A Very Difficult Review to Write...,"Suzanne Brockmann is my FAVORITE author. Hands Down. She has been for the last several years, ever since Linda Howard knocked herself off the throne she'd held for about 10 years. However, after reading several of her re-published contemporaries, I've discovered a horrible trend.If it's not part of her ""Troubleshooters"" or ""Seal Team 10"" series, it's probably not worth reading. I've realized this after reading a number of re-published duds, ""Freedom's Price"" being one of them. I'm beginning to realize that I'm going to have to leave these earlier published contemporaries in the bookstore.Still, a boring Brockmann is definitely better than any of the current offers. That's why she still gets 4 stars. But...I'll just wait and get my Brockmann fix from the next Troubleshooters book that's released. (Should be soon!) They NEVER disappoint."
3,Formulaic and Predictable,"Brockman is re-releasing a short romantic novel about Liam and Marisala, who have shared experiences during a civil war in a small South American country. Years later, Marisala's uncle sends her to America to attend college and learn to be ""civilized"". Liam is asked to help her make the adjustment. It's a light read with ""hot"" sex scenes, if you need that sort of thing to enjoy your book, but the plot lacks depth. Both characters struggle with their traumatic memories from the war; their gap in age causes some self-doubt about whether they would be right together. Age gap is overcome . . . Misunderstanding = precipitous breakup. Man has revelation, breaks through trauma to win the girl. Light, easy reading,completely devoid of challenge."
3,just ok,"Young South American freedom-fighter leader is about to start college in Boston & learn to be a lady per her uncle's demands. Journalist Hero was chosen to be her guardian & she sees this as a challenge, given that she's been in love with him since she helped him escape from South American prison 7 yrs ago. But Hero is resisting his attraction b/c of his unresolved issues re: his imprisonment & feeling constrained by his role as her guardian.This Brockmann book was alright. Nothing too spectacular. Romance, plot, & characters were ok. It wasn't as emotionally involving as her other books. Sexual chemistry was good as usual though.Recommended."
4,"A quick, fun read","With most authors I won't bother with their re-released, less than full length novels, which are never quite as good, but Suzanne Brockman is always one of my favorites. So I decided to give it a try, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. It does lack some of the depth and all of the suspense of her newer stories, but it's a sweet romance, with an engaging plot and characters who are easy to care about. A good single-serving read."
3,A Shared Name and Shared Affinity,"The facts: my wife loves dogs. Particularly ours,.. his name is also Wendell. Need I say more? A Christmas gift purchase a few years ago and well appreciated."
2,Too too precious,"Jenny Lee is the author of another book written prior to this one which seems to have received decent reviews, but she has also been a writer for such magazines as ""Redbook"". I believe this sort of writing is where her talent, as such, must lie. As a person who shares my home with five dogs, I adore my canine friends and family members and usually enjoy reading about the antics of other dogs, too, but this silly book -- complete with many sections written in ALL CAPS for emphasis (and lots of precious parenthetical asides, too!)-- was, regrettably, more than my stomach or patience could bear. After a couple of irritating chapters, it has been placed on the reject pile."
3,Fame! is the best...but this is not the best version.,"This book is vocal selections from the movie. It is great for what it is. Out Here on my Own, I Sing the Body Electric, and the title song, Fame, are all fantastic. However, if you would like better songs with the same kind of theme, try Vocal Selections from Fame The Musical!"
5,Great Morality Tale,"I loved this movie as a kid, and I love this movie as an adult. I am now 28 years old. This movie really makes you think about the savageness of the human species. The movie made me think long and hard about two things: 1) is it moral to slaughter animals, especially those that do not threaten us? 2) is our modern society really as sophisticated as we think, or much more primitive than we'd like to believe? Good movies should make us think, and this one definitely does."
4,Forget ET,"Usually I am not given to watching films of this type, perhaps it was the cast and crew that made me sit down and give it a chance? Whatever the reason I found this film a welcome break from the cloying and insincere ET. This film has true warmth and is a far superior film. The fine performances from Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen provide the viewer with wonderful moments of laughter and pathos. This is a touching film that stands the test of time.A generally good DVD transfer (a couple of minor moments of pixelation really only noticeable during totally black sections of the film)."
4,A warm yet bittersweet science-fiction/romance,Starman was a sleeper from 1984. The film has very good acting and as always John Carpenter has several messages to convey about American society and humankind in general. A fine instance of genre coalescence ie. science-fiction and romance. Highly recommended for all audiences-4stars.
5,Excellent,"This movie is Excellent all around. Great cast and Great Plot. ""Toad"" from American Graffiti plays a Excellent character"
2,Full Screen????,I love Starman and have been waiting for a wide screen version forever. What's up with this full screen nonsense? I advise people to wait and buy the DVD when the studio wises up and releases the widescreen version all the fans of this movie deserve!
5,Starman,Starman is one of my favorite movies and Jeff Bridges is one of my favorite actors. What more can be said. Both of them together in a heart jerker. I love it and am so pleased to have my own copy. I even have it on VHS.
5,Full Screen???,"What can I say? I saw this movie a long time ago in the cinema, then I rented it several times in VHS. I felt a little bit disapointed when I read the DVD version was in full screen format. But these people are talking about a different item, I ordered it anyway and it came in a double sided disk with a full screen version in one side and a wide screen one in the other. This is one of the best movies of all the time. It was done many years ago but I think it's still actual and timeless."
3,"Case beat and torn, disc looked rough but played.",I do not approve of Goodwill's practice of screening its donations and offering its items online for more than they cost in the stores.
3,Starman,While watching this movie I remembered seeing it before.With no real action the movie gets a little boring. I fell asleep watching it.
3,No French..,I will say for all French Canadian. There was french dubbed track in a lot of dvd... And now there is no more french in the re-released title Blu Ray! What the? I grew up and listen to this awesome movie with the french track why they just cut it out! COme on!
3,The Starman,"This filf has sentimental value to me, so that's why I'd ordered it. The acting's great but the story is alright.Great seller. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,Great Film.,"Viewed: 8/12Rate: 78/12: Starman is both charming and freaky at the same time. However, good performances come from Jeff Bridges, Karen Allen, and Charles Martin Smith. I realize that it's not simple to consistently act like a robot throughout the film, but Jeff Bridges does it and earns a deserving nomination. Starman is very much a hybrid between Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. with a lot of road traveling mixed in. It does get tiresome to see that everything has to happen in U.S.A. no matter what. Hello, there are other countries besides here where Starman could have landed in and perhaps have a better diplomatic experience. All in all, Starman is a good, powerful film to watch for the first time, but I don't think it holds up anymore after that."
5,THE MOST TOUCHING SCI FI FILM EVER!! 5 stars,"This movie really showcased Jeff Bridges talent, not to mention the wonderful but seldom seen in movies- Karen Allen. Bridges shows that he can pull off a multi layered role with ease. This movie made me cry, laugh hysterically, and made my spirit soar all in the spanse of 2 hours. Truly a remarkable and very thought provoking film. I wish they would make more movies like this one and stop making so-so films about aliens like INDEPENDENCE DAY or CONTACT.It seems the 1980s were the last decade of decent sci fi movies. Oh please dont let this be So! A must see for all ages."
5,A SCI-FI CLASSIC WITH ROMANTIC TWIST!!!,"This is undoubtably my favourite movie and a movie I would recommend to anyone, especially for it's sharp and sometimes humourous insights on our way of life. A substantial hit in England back in 1985 and certainly one of John Carpenters best, even if it is not what viewers expect from him. Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen take on-screen chemistry to new heights and I find it amazing they are both so underrated. Any filmmakers reading this - for Godsake use these talents. The DVD is a huge improvement over the already good VHS and Laserdiscs. There should really be a special edition released. Columbia are you listening?"
3,Not Bad,"I received the Blue-Ray DVD promptly and in excellent condition. I enjoyed watching this film again after first viewing it when it first came out in thetheaters. I would've like for it to have a behind the scenes look extras, butbecause the age of the film, there probably wasn't any made. Good film"
4,If you like sci fi and apple pie you'll like this,"I would almost describe this movie as a sci fi chick flick. Its a touching tale of what happened when an alien civilization answered the invitation we sent out with our Voyager probe. All you sci fi buffs know how that would go down, but don't let the inevitability of the end keep you from enjoying this uplifting and bittersweet story."
3,STARMAN,The story line was acceptable but lack continuity and reality in the category of a science fiction movie.After a few minutes into the movie you feel that it is like any other domestic movie involving the drama of two fugitives.Maybe it was produced in the 80s when expectation on special effects and sci fi type action were not so demanding.Anyway the acting was reasonably good and factual.
2,Who wants full screen?,"I didn't pay close enough attention to the description because the version I bought was the awful full screen format, which is NOT what I wanted to watch. If a film is made in Panavision it should be watched in Panavision, not full screen or pan and scan. What a waste."
1,Avoid this DVD transfer,No mater the size of your screen. This picture only fills a small center portion. You can increase the width or depth of the screen and it will remain in the center in a small unchanging window. It is one of the worse full screen transfers that I have ever seen. There is no widescreen version. The Blu-ray version may be better. I do not know.
3,"Dated, but philosophically entertaining.","I recently bought this DVD based on the synopsis, and when it was first released in 1984 it was likely good for it's day, but can't hold it's own with today's sci-fi videos. Both Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen give good performances all things considered, but the script writers and the director--for me--miss the boat by not fleshing out some of the scenes that could have benefited by more imaginative expansion. Almost deadly dull in the first half, it's a good yarn if you stick with it, but NOT RECOMMENDED in light of what's available today."
4,Starman w/Jeff Bridges,"I was very pleased with the service I received when ordering and receiving this CD. I gave it as a gift. However, I have never watched this movie."
2,Didn't like it,"Very formulaic and unbelievable. Thought it was rather shallow and superficial. I don't know about you, but from the time I saw that projected map of the US, I'd be asking a million questions. She seems to be exceptionally uninquisative. Who would send someone a zillion miles on an anthropoligical research mission, and then pick them up in three days, lest they die? Makes no sense. I hate to start a movie, and not finish it, but it was a real effort to finish this one.I love 1970s movies though, the country is so uncrowded, and the cops are so lumbering.One of the stars is because I love the Barney-Fife / Gomer-Pyle attitude that Bridges uses. Pure dork."
5,Star movie,"I was touched deeply by this ""corny"" movie about the lovebetween Karen Allen, a grieving widow, and Jeff Bridges, her alien lover. The performances were exquisite: Jeff's attempts at being human, like the first drag on a cigarette, were hilarious and touching, as was Karen's innocent responses. Something about the movie just grabbed me as few movies have."
5,Great Movie,This is a fun movie. Love Jeff Bridges and Karen Allen. Inter-galactic love story which gets you thinking about tolerance and just what is out there.
5,"Great film, great price","Got this for my husband for Christmas, we enjoyed it very much. This film begs for a part two, I wish someone in Hollywood would do so."
3,Bought it as a gift,"I have no comment, it was a Christmas gift & I am am not the one on the receiving end."
4,Startman on Bluray is great ..but no extras...,How can they put a good movie like Starman on bluray and not add extras....PityWould have been nice to hear output form what the actor/actress taught about theirroles in this great little movie from the past that continues to be good at everyview.Enjoy
4,Trucks! Tractors! Tunes!,"This is a great kid video. We've watched this almost non stop for the past year. My son (age 3) points out every truck or piece of large equipment we see and can tell me what it's used for. It's a great vocabulary builder. He even sings the songs while playing in the sand box. The animation segments are stupid, but they're short and the rest of the video is outstanding."
2,Extremely Disappointed,"As an admirer of Camus and Sartre I expected a great deal more from Beauvoir touching upon the human condition post-WW 2. Post WW 2 found men like Sartre and Camus in great personal turmoil, at loss to understand the nature of man and the society he found himself living in. What I found in this book were cliches and a great deal of saccharine. Her longwinded descriptions of her love affair with Nelson Algren was terribly boring, and without literary merit. Oh does he love me; he doesn't love me; he does love me, etc. This goes on and on ad nauseum. What insipid nonsense. What it comes down to is this book lacks sou. She did not once in this massive book touch me in a meaningful manner. She did not explore the inner and outer conflicts of an engaged person. I would say that you are wasting your time reading this book."

2,Not a keeper,"This model worked OK for about 9 months, then the caller ID quit working. It would work for a short stretch and then go out. I agree with the complaint about the volume, also."
3,this phone is a terrible piece of crap! But the at&t phone i had i could'nt even see the screen! at least this one is better!,"I had this phone from October to the 3rd week of january and then even before i had it was terribly crackling and the reception was horrible!Then at the 3rd week of January it started popping really loud like pop corn! 3 days later i was completly sick of it and i threw it away!Phew, Now i have a GE phone that is great and finally works great! I would'nt recommend this item to anyone at all!I can think of other and better ways to spend your money than on this piece of crap!"
1,Click the Back Button Now!!!,"I had this phone for approximately a month before I had to return it for replacement. Not once.....but three times. I finally gave up and thought I could grin and bear the horrible reception (it sounded like you were going through a wind tunnel), these odd popping noises, and the other little quirks (like the odd way you check caller id). But now a little less than a year later, caller id has stopped working and sometimes I can't answer the phone via the speakerphone. The features are great, but the phone is as painful as water torture. I can think of better ways to waste money."
1,Trying to return it!,"The caller ID has stopped working, I have to unplug it to ""reset"" it almost every day. The volume is too low as well. Would not recommend this item - although I would suggest going with a dual handset, very handy!"
3,Not Too Bad,"""Diplomatic Immunity"" is a right-wing domestic thriller with some amateurish qualities but also some genuine shoot-em-up, track-em-down excitement. An interesting read."
3,This book never stands still. It keeps moving.,It was nice to read a book that was on the go from the first page to the last.
4,This book is a rough rollercoaster ride of pure adrenalin!,"Take an average American ""Joe"" and his family. Then throw in a diabolical nemesis intent on wreaking havoc, only to hide behind the protective veil of diplomatic immunity. Mix them up and what do you get? Palm-sweating action, raw adventure and edge-of-your seat thrills.Can the nightmare Joe Ash and his family experienced actually happen? The answer might just chill your blood."
2,Sequel Syndrome,"Saber Marionette J was a wonderful series and I highly recommend it. This however, is your typical disppointing sequel. The plot extensions are weak and the characters lack the charm they had in SMJ. As a fan of SMJ, I know how tempting it is to pick up this sequel, even though someone tells you its bad, just because you want more SMJ than they gave you. I did. Take my advice; you can find better stuff to spend your money on than this."

4,nice glasses,These glasses are nice but dainty. I am not a huge scotch drinker but i bought them for my father who loves them.
1,Keroro's Review- Demonic Layer,"Angelic Layer. Sigh.I bought this DVD a while back around New Year's. I thought it would be good because all my friends reccomended it. Boy, this anime was boring. The characters were not very original, but let me tell you why I gave at least one star. It was becuase of Icchan! He was the best character, and frankly, I liked him better the Misaki. She was just so plain and boring, and he was funny and out-going.Anyway, I don't think you should buy this, but if you want to waste money, go ahead.~This has been a review written by Keroro"
2,Disapointing,"A far cry from ""Just Correct"" which was VERY FUNNY. ""Girth"" was way too short, there were no extras, and the jokes were the same ones I heard at Ralphie's live shows. Really not worth the $15. I am a BIG Ralphie fan from Last Comic and I have seen him live 3 times, so I was expecting alot more. I was very disapointed."
4,"yes, it works with Andis BGRC","Not one review specifically mentions that it works with BGRC, yet it does. Someone was saying no, and I was scared at first as it didnt fit on the blade that was on the clipper. However, there was the smaller blade that comes with the package, and try that, it works like a charm. So far very satisfied."
1,"These are spring loaded and work well, but......","I was getting ready to send these back and filled out the information for Amazon. I noticed you could buy a large size, so I thought there were two different size Andis blades. Not the case. These don't snap on like the package says, they slide on. The directions are incorrect and you must attach the two metal snap hooks to the bottom of the blade and then use your thumb(s) to slide the comb forward and along the top of the back of the blade until it snaps onto the teeth. It is actually simple once you know. These appear to be of high quality and made very well, so I expect these to last as long or longer than the clipper. I gave it one star because the idiots that sell these have not addressed the incorrect instructions on the package, nor have they modified the Amazon site to rectify the issue. I will change this review if they ever get a clue."
1,Clipper Combs,"These combs did not fit my Andis Plus clipper #40 blade. The #40 is the smallest blade and they just wouldn't go. I ended up ordering directly from Andis for a little more--presto, they work great."
3,So-so.,"My goldendoodle has fast growing, tangle-prone hair that I like to keep trimmed short. In an effort to save on grooming expenses, I got this clipper comb along with a high quality Andis clipper and #10 blade. For the most part, the combs didn't work so well on my dog, who has soft, fine, wavy/curly hair that goes in every direction. Except with the shortest combs, I had to make multiple passes to get a cut that looked sort of clean, and it never came out anywhere near as even as his groomer did it. Because it took multiple passes, it took hours of cutting to get my dog looking decent.After seeing what professional groomers use, I've concluded that combs are okay for touching up or for working around the beard, but if you want a clean 3/4 inch cut you should just use an appropriately sized clipper blade--at least on my dog's coat."
3,AGC2,"I was about to return this thing because it didn't fit my clipper.I was searching different size blades to buy since I was returning this combs, I found some other combs and read reviews, thinking that might be the one I should have bought.The review said something about spring and it's easy to put on and stuff.I ran back to my living room and opened the package for the one last time. and WALA!the metal clip looking thingy on the bottom of this comb moves!and it does fit my AGC2 clipper.Crazy I was about to return it and write a bad review.The reason for 3 stars is that it doesn't look strong at all.I felt like I was breaking it when I tried to take the blade off."
4,Great Clipper set,"These fit perfectly on my Andis Clipper but quite honesly, I like the plastic ones that came with the clipper set when I purchased it. The metal set is a bit hard to snap on and off but they do work and I'm very happy that I've found these replacements."
4,Quick Shipment,Very fast reply and turn around on order process. item displayed was identical to item received. Would definitly use again!
2,andis snap-on combs,"These combs are just OK. They snap-on so you think they are on solidly, but they fall off when there is any kind of resistance. So if you hit some tangles or matted fur, the combs can't get through and get stuck or they fall off the clipper. Pretty dissapointing for what they charge."
4,Good but...,"These do a very good job. They attached to my Andis ultra edge trimmer with no problem. However, for some reason they do tend to get the dogs hair caught right at the edge. It will sometimes pull and I have to stop the trimmer fuss with figuring out how to untangle the hair and start up again. Other than that, I have had no problems. Super quick shipping."
5,Very Versatile.,I have been clipping my Kerry Blue Terrier since I got him at the age of 4 months. He is now 5 years old. I have both an Andis and an Oster clippers. These clipper combs work for both. Great buy!!
4,Clippers for shorter haired dogs,I chose these to trim my mixed breed and a sliky terrier. They fit as they should and are just the size for proper trimming
4,Works good,A little hard to get them on the clippers but works good. If you have weak hands forget about using these.
4,clipper combs,We just got the pro clipper and they slide on great to it but it takes a little longer to clip the cats and dog when you have the attachments on them.
1,Disappointed,"Item was not as advertised. The combs were supposed to fit the Andis size 30 blade, but were way to small."
5,Great Quality,Very happy with these. There is a trick to them. They are spring loaded in a way. You have to put them on and pull to get them to fit.
5,Great combo to use with the Andis Detachable Blades,"Although I have other snap on comb sets that were included with other clippers, I am glad I ordered the Andis Snap-On Combs and have used them with the No. 10 detachable blade. I use snap on combs a lot when I groom our Lhasa and also use the Andis No. 10,7,5, and 3-3/4 detachable blades too. The snap-on set was packaged very well, arrived in great condition, and within promised delivery time."
1,does not fit my Andis clippers,"BEWARE. I just purchased this set for my andis clippers. They do not fit and the return shipping is going to cost me as much as what I paid for the set. BEWARE.So much for them being ""universal"". False labeling at the very least."
4,Clipper Combs,These combs are well made and fit securely on my clippers. However my dog has fine hair and my Andis clippers do not cut well with the combs on - I suspect this has more to do with my dog's hair and the sharpness of my clippers and not related to the combs.
3,A Sorry Mess,"What would have been a really great disc is ruined by a very bad print. I'm stunned by the poor quality of this disc and feel ripped off. The sound was very good in surround, but the picture quality was the worst I've seen on any disc. It looks like it was bootlegged. When you press ""play"" you get the terrible Eros film ads. Who are these idiots? The subtitles worked but the only way I could watch the film was to avoid ""play"" and start the film with the ""chapters."" Unbelievable! Amazon, you're losing credibility."
2,Indian cinema,"Since I do not speak the language, the subtitles did not come up so I was lost in fully understanding what was being said. I ended up giving the movie to an Indian friend knowing she would appreciate and get more out of it. The fact that the movie stated subtitles and there were not was a disappointment."
3,"Good flick, lousy DVD","Kuch Naa KahoGood film. If you like Bollywood, this is a keeper, especially since it stars Ash Rai and her (then) future husband. However, the on demand DVD produced by amazon.com was less than acceptable; video and audio quality not up to current standards. I encourage you to buy the DVD, but not this version!!!"
2,Terrible Quality.,I am a minute into the movie and it sounds like an echo with some crackling. I hope the story doesn't disappoint me too. $3.99 is TOO much for this quality...really.
2,Kuch Naa Kaho,For 1 isn't wasn't in English and there was no indication it wouldn't be. People should be warned. It was too slow and the story line lack life.
3,Compression - poor picture quality!,- good movie but let down by poor picture - obviouly not the original - was probably compreseeduntil what we got - poor picture quality - someone made a fast buck by giving inferior quality - back home I could get better quality for half the money - only thing is - this title was not available - never again! - hope this only happens to Asian movies - have not come accross this compression on foreign titles!
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I admit it, I was surprised at how good this movie was. This was my first bollywood movie ever, I have yet to see even Bride & Prejudice. It wasn't nearly as over the top as people told me it would be. I enjoyed Raj's antics, even though his incredible, pathetic, story about how he needed that last seat on the plane because his son Babloo was sick from a heart attack had me rolling my eyes with a groan. I was outright laughing in the school scene when Raj lived up to Adi's boasting and jumped from the roof of the school and then had to kick a soccer ball back up onto the roof. It's a good thing for Namrata that Raj really did love her, because she was so stupid sometimes and stubborn that many a man would have walked away. All in all, even though this movie was surprisingly long, at 2 hours and 46 minutes, It's well worth the time to watch it."
1,"Good movie, horrible video quality","This particular version of the movie is provided on a DVD-R disc, ""Manufactured by Amazon.com., Lexington,KY"" and the video compression is really horrible -- lots of compression artifacts, glitches, and skips. It is practically unwatchable. Maybe the higher-priced version of the movie, which Amazon also sells, is better...I don't know. Do not waste your money on this version."
1,No Subtitles - an update,"I can't write a review of this product because the subtitles didn't work. There was a subtitle option on the menu but it didn't work. The subtitle button on my remote only got me a ""not available message."" I like bollywood films, but I have to have a translation.Update - I returned the old DVD and got a replacement after awhile and this one had the subtitles. It's much easier to follow the story. Rai is gorgeous as usual and the songs are great."
4,Fantastic Example of Bollywood comedy,"I rented this video through amazon when I first started to get into bollywood a year ago. I promptly bought the disk, as this movie combines great acting with good comedy and a good plot. The battle of the sexes song, Baat Meri Suniye to Zara, is hilarious. Definitely a movie to see if you're wanting to look into the bollywood film experience."
3,so-so,The start of the movie was a little hard to get into. It was a little more difficult to get used to the bollywood style than I thought it would have been. However once I got into the movie I liked it and will watch it again.
1,Difficult to follow,Please save your time and do not watch this movie! The director uses the same images over and over again without any specific plot. It is an artistic movie to some degree... The director is trying too hard and does not succeed in captivating any sort of audience.
5,Visually stunning and great acting.,"No question Kurosawa was a master director and here he proves it as he masters perhaps his toughest task to date, the wilds of Siberia. Taken from a Russian novel that Kurosawa had wanted to film for quite a while, Dersu Uzala is many things at once. It's the story of man against nature and man against himself while at the same time man fusing with nature and with oneself and the comparisons that can be made inbetween. The character of Dersu is perhaps as unique as any that has ever been included in cinema. He is completely unique from any of his Hollywood 'mountain man' cohorts. The photography in Dersu Uzala is breathtaking. From all the color of autumn to the desolation and bleakness of winter, the cinematography is top notch. The ending of this film will stay with you for a long time afterwards. A very moving film."
1,Technically miserable,"Let's make it clear from start : the movie is a pure masterpiece and will top rank in anyone vidéo collection. The point here is the DVD transfer which is a catastrophy. I am not a techno nut & am very tollerant when there is some quality problems here & there. But this DVD has to be a case on what can go wrong : the sound is scratchy at best, the colors are mostly saturated or are totally faded, the picture goes constantly out of focus, ... Things where so bad I checked my hardware with another DVD ! For the price this is a rip-off."
2,"Blush, Kino","Wonderful film, one of my top ten, but this is a terrible DVD. My videotape is MUCH better. Kino must have searched for the worst possible print to transfer; every flaw is preserved and magnified. A ridiculous, cheap, cynical, hack-job on a beautiful film. How did this happen, and why won't someone with a conscience do this film DVD justice?"
1,shame shame shame,Dersu is one of my favorite films of one of my favorite directors. What a shame it did not get an adaquate treatment on DVD. The pictorial quality is inferior awful and disgusting. If You love this film don't buy this product.
2,"Great Film, Lousy DVD","Kino once again takes a great film and gives it the hatchet treatment. In fairness, I suppose that Kino puts out films that aren't likely to have the popular appeal (and price tags) of those issued by Criterion. But that's no excuse for taking non-anamorphic transfers of 'Scope films from lousy prints. At least they didn't put in hard subs this time."
5,The perfect male bonding movie,"I first went to see this film more than twenty years ago with indifference because it was a ""foriegn film "". This film changed forever that niave bias and opened up a whole new world of films to embrace. I have suggested it time and again to male friends that need an example of male bonding. For me it demonstrates, at moments, the best of men laughing at themselves, nurturing and loving in ways that need few or no words. I will never forget this film."
5,An out-of-the-way masterpiece,"Kurosawa had to go all the way to Siberia to regenerate his career in films (after his lambasting with ""Dodes-kaden,"" which prompted a suicide attempt). Yet he managed to make a film entirely congruent with his concerns. ""Dersu Uzala"" is about heroism - a subject familiar to any Kurosawa enthusiast. And the photography is particularly exquisite. This is so much more than an episode in the life of a misunderstood genius. ""Dersu"" almost exceeds most of Kurosawa's other work of the '60s. Hereafter he would be an 'international' filmmaker."
3,It warps once it gets hot in the oven,"I am looking for a good cookie sheet that does not warp up once it gets hot in the oven. Sadly, this cookie sheet does. It's fine if you use it for catching drips from a heavy casserole dish. The weight of the dish keeps the sheet from flipping up once it gets hot."
3,Coin Envelopes,The envelopes are as advertised except that they don't seal properly. I have to tape every one. The seal won't hold.
5,Tropical Quilt,"I got this quilt in a King size for our master bedroom. I've been looking for the colors that are in this for a long time. I also bought the euro shams. I wish there were curtains in the same material, but I don't think they're offered. The quilt is beautiful! The colors are very vivid and reminds me of staying at a caribbean resort, which is what I had in mind. Of course I haven't washed it yet, so I can't comment on how it launders, but it appears to be nicely made. The size is also very generous, and I have a thick mattress. Nice over-hang!"
4,a fresh new track from the beats',"This a kicken new track from the beatnuts,and its even an import!(how much better can it get?)If you want the newest of tha chain single, this is a must."
1,"Why, why, why...","When you shop in the land of VHS, some DVDs are still around from then as well.I am not going to waste a lot of time on plot or actors because it really doesn't have either in the film. This was an independant film on a budget, rating really low on the ""why would you buy"" scale. I think I might have seen a handicam shakin out part of this movie, too, because the mood in this is supposed to be one thing but it turns to something different.I saw a review from someone that knew an actor from the local area and even they could find nothing to say except ""I even knew one of the guys in it."" cold but deservedly a 1/5."
5,Fascinating black 'n white biography,"Well, for $1 what a bargin!! Large A4 black and white(photos and lots of them) book about lady who wrote ""out of africa"" that became the film of same name with Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Story of her extra orinary life ( Denmark and Africa..with a visit to the USA thrown in a few years before her death in 1963(? Became a well known writer under name of Isak Dinesen, and wrote with colourful prose,This book is 37 years old and was written by her secretary Easy to read and an excellent story and reference book.(,really both rolled into one)Lots of photos and if you loved the movie, you should read about the lady who actually lived the life..rich story, about love, marriage, relationships and being an author who Makes IT... Buy it..dont be put off by the raw quality of the paper and photos.."
5,GUNDAM.,"This is the original gundam that is worth the money I watch the whole thing and this is the real deal. Get this instead of the series with I don't know 4 or 5 episodes in it because it is better like this even though it is 2hour in each and you might get bored some of the time but good. This is one of the original mech series if you really like robotic anime get gundam or robotech/macross plus because those are great anime. This is better then some of the other gundam series like gundam wing or g gundam,THEY REALLY SUCK. Get these which I am gonna list.Gundam 08th Moible Suit teamGundam 0080 war in the pocketGundam 0083 Stardust MemoryGundam Char's CounterattackIf you like this you will like these as well."
1,Beware,"Beware, these DVD's are only in Japaese. I don't understand it and I don't read subtitles. Well I've been bitten by this I only hope others read this and avoid problems... at no stage was it indicated that it was in anything apart from Eglish."
5,"Nice, but old Anime","This is a nice Movie set, and a must have for Gundam Fans, but it is old Anime, late 70's or early 80's.The thing that I don't like about the DVD, is it does not have English dubbing, Just Japanese with English sub."
4,Classic Randy Travis,"This video is great. Randy's charm and amusing personality shines through.This video is 10 years old and filled with Randy's classic hits as well his high engery. In the late 80's, early 90's, Randy was credited with being the first to break down the traditional country barriers....this video proves it!It is true to it's title forever and ever........this is timeless."
5,great product & transaction,"Great to listen to Randy and see him perform. Good variety, some serious and some funny."
3,Doesn't work exactly as expected.,"Although the chain is of good quality, it doesn't work as well as I had hoped. The rain doesn't flow directly to the chain, but drips all around the gutter's circumference. Seems like the attachment part needs a better design."
3,"Looks good, does not function well.",Looks great but as far as functioning as a down spout substitute you might as well let the rain water pour straight from the gutter. No cascading effect here and I live in WA.
3,"Nice, but too expensive","Title says it all. It is nice, and easy to install. But why on earth something like this costs so much, it beats me? That said, it was one of the least expensive ones."
5,Beautiful!!!,Absolutely love this. I also bought the separate copper cup that hangs at the top and helps divert water onto the chainBeautiful to watch in the rain.
4,"Sublime, Atmospheric Pop","Despite being a long time in the making, or perhaps because of it, 'Wires', the debut full-length album from Melbourne melancholists Art Of Fighting is a fantastic album, having the necessary nuances to push an album from the 'good' to the 'great' category. The pace and volume of the tracks rarely rises above a murmur, which lends the album a late-evening brooding atmosphere. AOF share similar traits with many of their contemporaries, particularly the seemingly mournful lyrical content, however also show a sense of optimism and use of the pop hook which sometimes is forgotten about by other artists. The tracks which consistently shine above the rest include 'Akula' and the utterly fantastic 'Reasons Are All I Have Left', which is approximately four minutes of pure atmospheric artpop. The critically-acclaimed Wires is something that sounds great now, and most likely will have the staying power that will make it sound great in twenty or thirty years."
1,Phone will not last,"As others mentioned, we bought this phone for the price. I would disagree with one previous note, the sound quality was always very clear. But, 2 years later, we are buying a new phone because the buttons stick on this one. After about 18 months of moderate use, the buttons started responding sporadically. Sometimes they work fine, other times they would not even respond to being pressed, and then other times, they would double dial when you press them once. I would not recommend this phone to anyone who wants something that won't be in the landfill 2 years later."
5,In no way second best!,"It just adds to the picture of Early Barbra. Still, I believe the best is yet to come: for me The Third Barbra Streisand Album is the very best of pre-TV special, pre-mega star Barbra. There's still plenty on this album to be happy with - a superb Anywhere I Hang My Hat Is Home for example. Not as 'raw' and not so much the ingenue as on the first album, not as polished and sensuous as the third. But still great."
4,Not as good as her first album,"...but still a million times better than modern day sophomore albums from pop stars of today. Still it could have been so much better as Babs sings a little tamer and the selection is a little bland, but Streisand still shines because she has the voice. i definitely recommed Gotta Move-one of my favorite songs of her whole catalog."
5,My First Barbra Streisand Album,"I was 9 years old when I first heard this album. I will never forget the effect of hearing ""My Coloring Book"" that first time. I was with my parents visiting some friends who owned the album. I think I got my mother to take me to buy the album the next day. (...)Standouts to me are ""Any Place I Hang My Hat is Home,"" ""When the Sun Comes Out,"" and ""Have I Stayed Too Long at the Fair."" Sentimentally, this will always be an important album to me, but I think it's a superb introduction to anyone who wants to experience the early Barbra Streisand.At the time, her records, her looks, her personality, were unlike anything anyone had seen before. She was becoming a sensation that has now become a legend. I highly recommend ""The Second Barbra Streisand Album."""
1,Definitely not worth the money,"I've had great experiences with Bosch tools and appliances, so I thought I'd give one of their vacuums a try. At first, I liked the fact that it was lightweight and quiet, but I ran into several problems:- the handle and brush attachment are awkward to use. It's impossible to vacuum things like the top of a television.- the plastic used on the wand is cheap, and the wand broke just after the warranty ran out- a couple of times that I was vacuuming a particularly dusty floor (during home renovations), the bag popped off and large amounts of dust got sucked into the motor. Now the vacuum is considerably noisier than it should be, and it heats up considerably after a little use.Because of all of these problems, I am now looking for a new vacuum after just two years. My previous canister vacuum, a Kenmore, lasted about a decade before the motor blew. Time go look at the Mieles..."
2,Toxic,"""Though this vacuum has excellent suction. well thought out attachments, and very easy to push among many other accolades there is one glaring problem. In the user manual it states ""handling the cord on this product will expose you to lead,"". Well if you have children or your pregnant, well lead is a four letter word. Of corse I found this out after my pregnant wife finished rolling up the cord"""
2,So basic its boring,I'm a beginning CGI artist who recently purchased 3D Studio Max. I was looking for a basic beginners guide. I expected a good beginners book because I own other peachpit press books and they are wonderful. Taking one look I was disappointed because this book didn't offer very much. Half of the stuff discussed in the book I learned by just playing around in the program. There are several books that are better then this one. I even found the tutorial book that comes with the program more helpful. Your better off spending a few extra bucks and getting something with some substance.
4,Great overview,"This book provided a quick overview for someone already familiar with animation using Lightwave. It's not going to bring you to a pro level, but it's a good reference and start for the beginner. The ""visual"" icons actually do help, as advertised."
4,Very nice book,"I found this book to be very helpful and to the point. I appreciated the focus on the interface of the program. My background in 3d modeling and animation was nil until I got this book. As with any type of graphic software, you must come into it with a goal. With that in mind this book will get you from concept to ""reality"" very quickly. Buy this book"
5,A GREAT TEXT BOOK FOR SUDIO MAX AMATUERES AND PROS,Iam 14 years old and this book has been the best i read.It reads as a text so its easy to look up information.This book is advancing me to my future as a 3d drawler.I recamened this to people who dont want to take a long time to learn the basics and the more advance features.And this book covers all.
2,"Good, not great","If you like a book that makes you go from chapter to chapter to finish something you already started in one chapter, then you find that what you wanted isn't even covered as told by a previous chapter, or if you're the type of person that enjoys hints to subjects instead of detailed explanations because you would like to discover everything on your own, buy this book. If you are like me, who likes to use the product and just want a reference guide, this book is lacking greatly. I purchased it based on the reviews, I guess they aren't beginners because this book doesn't cross it's t's or dot it's i's. The picture idea however is good. I just wish they were more detailed... What can you expect for the $ I guess."
5,Absolutely loved this video!,"I bought this video before purchasing my 8 week old puppy, but didn't actually watch it until the puppy was 5 1/2 months old. Big mistake! Although this video was made many years ago, the training techniques shown by Ian Dunbar are very fresh. He is the grandfather of the ""kinder, gentler"" approach to the dog training methods that have become so popular today. I highly recommend this video to ALL new puppy owners!"
3,Not what I expected,"I'd heard many good things about Ian Dunbar, and was even considering taking one of his workshops...until I saw this video. I found his manner a bit too critical and scolding of the humans in his workshop when they did something he didn't like. I was surprised when he occasionally hit and shouted at the dogs. Okay, maybe hitting is the wrong word, it was more like a hard tap, but his manner seemed unnecessary to me. In fairness, I've been a fan of Karen Pryor and have attended one of her workshops and never saw this negativity towards humans or animals, so I'm probably biased. This video does seem a bit dated, so maybe he's softened in his approach. There are good things to learn from this, and I was open to learning new ways, but it's unlikely I'll take his workshop. I'd recommend this video with reservations."
2,"I swear that when I ordered this ""puppy"" was nowhere in the description.","I thought I was purchasing the ""Dunbar training method"" I guess in retrospect the fact that it is geared to puppies is obvious. That is when people train their dogs, when they are a few months old and beyond. Because of Dunbar's famous book ""How to teach an old dog new tricks"" I assumed this video might be geared for older dogs who needed help with some of the basics that may have proven too difficult the first round of puppy classes.I was very dissapoined given the price point for this video , it is amaturish in production quality and lacks an over arching organization. It would be a good product if say, you had not chossen your dog yet, and you wanted to see what you are in for commiment wise with training and raiseing a dog. I wish I could have returned it. I am still on the look out for a video that deals with dogs over 1 year old."
1,Sirius puppy training. Dr Ian Dunbar,"DVD was Ok, but not very realistic. The classes take place in what looks like a church hall. Not a typical place to be interacting with your puppy. But I'm hopeful I will find something useful in it."
2,Sirius Puppy training video,"AAAAh, this video is really old like from the 70s - 80s, although it has some useful things, it is a bit boring."
3,Mighty expensive,"Very Nice and stylish cart. The only thing prohibitive about it is the price. I would gladly pay $50 for it.There is also the other cart that is available in stores for around$40, but in my considered opinion, this one is better."
4,Looks Cool...but,"Looks good, easy to assemble, the Q fits in perfectly and I am totally satisfied. However, don't be surprised at how......well, let me just say - it probably cost $8 bucks to make"
4,Stand for Webber gas B B Qer,"OK machine. The pictures in the how to put it together I grade ""C-"".There should be a caution someplace that says ""Be careful which handleyou grab to move the machine, as it is exciting when you grab the wrong one."""
5,Don't buy it for the Weber 100!,"It is a good stand, but I made the mistake of buying it for the Weber 100 grill. Only after it was put together did we realize it was not for the little grill. So, we bought the 200 to go with the stand, and gave it to Grandma, who wanted a new grill. Anyway, if you are looking for a stand for the Weber 100, this in NOT the one."
2,"Okay looks, but nothing as nice as the grill","The cart looks relatively good and is quite sturdy for a plastic assembly, but the construction is nowhere comparable to that of the grill itself. I feel like I own a beautifully engineered grill stitting on a large Rubbermaid tub.Also, the design makes it a real pain to move around even a few feet -- the handle is just too far in. I guess that might be why they named it ""stationary"" even though it has wheels.What a pity."
1,"New Item #6508, the old number is 54601","New Item #6508, the old number is 54601For some reason, both model numbers are listed separately on Amazon. Trying to find out the difference between the models cost me about 20 minutes of life that I'll never get back! The answer: there is no difference. Some genius decided to add value simply by changing the model number! Now that I know, I can proceed to checkout."
4,A Must Have!,"Dacey's book is a classic and a must have for those who want to learn about estate planning. As a third year law student interested in estate planning and probate, I would recommend this book for those who want more knowledge about the area and who want to have meaningful questions to ask his or her lawyer."
1,Not appropriate for children.,"Art is beautiful but content is not appropriate for children. Possibly appropriate for a high school student but not for an elementary student. Certainly not appropriate for a preschooler. This is classified as an illustrated children's book. I would recommend reviewing the book in a library or a bookstore prior to purchasing it on amazon so as not to risk the time, effort, and a not-in-full refund or the return shipping rate."
3,"I'm OK, You're OK","This movie is just OK. Which is bad, because all the good actors involved here could have made a great movie together. But not.The story about 3 diverse couples coming together for a school ""60s pageant"" could have been relevant, meaningful, poignant and funny. It is none of the above. It could be a Lifetime made-for-TV movie.There is profound sadness in the scene where Beau Bridges' now-middle-aged hippie character is asked to talk to his son's class about Woodstock, but then is not allowed to talk about WHY - no politics allowed - just the fads, fashions, rock & roll - of My Generation. No Nixon. No Viet Nam. Reducing the 60s to tie-dyed butterflies and bellbottoms stripped of political and sociological context.No *Big Chill,* it's a lukewarm waste of time and talent. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
2,Bland Story,"The film follows three couples in different stages of their marriages--a pair of newlyweds, a couple who have walked the aisle again after their respective divorces, and a long wedded couple. The only halfway decent storyline involves the last couple, a couple of former hippies dealing with their kids and sticking to their 1960's principals. Other than a few good zingers (esp. the one Cybill Shepard says to her stepdaughter in a clothing store), this film never rises to the drama level it's reaching for."
3,A good time waster,"This is quite a good cast in service of a so-so story. These three couples have little in common beside the school where they meet at a PTA conference. The acting of Mary Stuart Masterson is first class. In fact the acting of the three female leads keeps the whole thing from descending into a treacly mess. The final scenes with the children performing a school skit to Joni Mitchell's ""Circle Game"" was amazing. I'm a sucker for happy endings and this movie left me with a a big smile on my face"
2,"Dull, unfunny and unappealing movie","Oh great, here comes another movie about people's lives intersecting. This time it's at a PTA meeting in New York where one couple is a group of hippies, another couple just got married, and a third one are who are supposedly the only ""normal"" characters in the movie...or maybe you can figure it out. The characters here were not of the least interest to me (in fact they were quite repellent!), the screenplay is paper thin and all-too-familiar, and New York City is not particularly a beautiful place to look at so I can't give the filmmakers credit on photography or location. For a much more subtle and original (not to mention a WHOLE LOT better) movie with a vaguely similar storyline, see GRAND CANYON, a great 1991 movie that is superbly acted, enlightening, and almost magical."
3,"Tiazinha, obrigado pela essa festa!","If you're buying the CD because she looks great in a black leather bra ([heck], I wish I could look that good in one!), you'll be pleasantly surprised at how danceable and enjoyable the music on the CD is. Standout tracks are ""Uh Tiazinha!"" (with droll vocals by Vinny), ""Sou Mais Eu,"" ""Tiazinha Story"" and her cute, energetic remake of the Archies' ""Sugar Sugar."" Pop music doesn't get any more disposible, nor any more infectious, than this. Muita gostosa!"
2,Three Simple Steps to Healthy Pets: The Holistic Animal Care LifeStyle,"I was under-whelmed and felt like I was reading an ""info-commercial"". I have a 12 year old dog who is having some health problems so I have been reading allot. This is at the bottom of my list."
4,genial,"este dvd sin duda es divertido aunque un poco decepcionante ya q varios de los capitolos ya habian sido utilizados antes en televison, pero aun asi cumple con el objetivo."
4,A nice quiet read,The story of a couple and a stray dog of unsual quality who eventually fall in love with each other
2,The dog who came to stay,I thought it was very boring. Too much going on and on about nothing interesting. The last half was a little better
2,boring,This man says he is a writer...I love dog stories but it was so uninteresting I could not finish it. Not a book for dog lovers.
5,Andreas THE POET Johnson,"This album is the milestone of music history ... you haven't to think only to Glorious song cos everyone is different form everyone else! Take a look to the jazz part of Please (do me right), or the ark part of Do you believe in Heaven... the ironic one People and the anti pollution Unbreakable. Very good are also his singles where you can find other b-sides. Let's go ... buy it!"
4,Swedish Delight,"The new swedish artist Andreas Johnson brings forth a great album that has my head spinning. From his unique lyrics to inventive melodies, you will not be able to quit playing this album. The song Glorious is sure to be a major hit - and it is a grave injustice if it is not. There is not one minute on this album that will bore you. Buy it!"
5,This is not Charlotte Charlotte Church,"It seems that all of the other reviewers were under the impression that this is a CD from Charlotte Church. They were, however, terribly misinformed. While Charlotte Church is an amazing artist with a wonderful voice, she is not the same as the artist Charlotte. Charlotte is dance music/vocal house artist. She sang last year's huge hit Skin, and is a favorite on dance floors everywhere. This CD is a compilation of remixes by the world's most famous DJ, Junior Vasquez. On it he remixes two songs, Charlotte's Don't Be Afraid of the Dark, and Kim English's Higher Things. The mixes cover everything from the shorter radio edits, to the extended club versions, and even hard beat mixes. Junior Vasquez remains one of the best remixers in the industry, and these mixes are among his best. If you are a fan of Charlotte Church, then this is not your type of CD, but if you are a fan of Junior's or of vocal house music, then this is a must have."
1,What a STINKER!,This album is the most uncreative stuff I have ever heard. Made by stupid stoned people. Not musical in any way. Nothing but a drum machine for the duration of all tracks. Not worth the postage... or raw materials used to produce the CD. I give it no stars.
2,Clip hid her voice!,"Charlotte has the most beautiful and angelic voice I have ever heard. On the sample clips, I cannot hear her voice. I have all the other tapes and CDs of hers, and I rate them with five stars. I wish I could hear this new one in total; perhaps it is a problem with the sample clips and not with her talent."
5,wedgwood at its most lovely,got this piece as part of my collection. was amazed at the detail and quality. saw it on a national shopping channel for more plus shipping and tax. good value and great addition for any wedgwood collector.
2,Historical Interest,There are 100 women illustrated with poorly presented still photos and about 5 or 6 short video clips in 8 or 16mm. Bunny describes all the women and gives a little history. I found it somewhat interesting but was put off by the multiple poorly copied still photos.
1,No Touch Monkey Book...Literally,"I purchased what I thought would be an interestingly humorous book for my mother-in-law who travels frequently, as do I. I also purchased one for myself, so that perhaps we might discuss it. In a word...just plain asinine. The travel adventures of the writer were absolutely void of common sense and/or intelligence. I give this book .5 of a grain of moon sand. Save your money, and travel with real class. Truthfully, the only humorous event was when Ayun had her knee realigned by a witch doctor. Hoo, hee. *sigh*"
1,Sucked in by Steven Colbert!,"As I stood in line at the bookstore I overheard several people talking about this book. ALL of them said it was hysterically funny, well-written and worth it. Since I was in the market for a funny read, I grabbed a copy for myself. When I saw that Steven Colbert had ""endorsed"" it, I bought it. I think Mr. Colbert's quote is something like, ""I laughed hysterically reading this book."" Perhaps that was just the first part of a sentence taken out of context and the rest of the quote was, "".... because she actually was paid for this dribble!"" Really, it isn't funny, nor is it especially well written. Save your money."
4,Tales of trouble from an experienced traveler...,"I'm not sure whether Ayun Halliday just traveled a lot so she's had many chances to get into so much travel (and most travelers do tend to get into trouble in foreign places), or whether she just has the knack of getting herself & her companions into trouble (whether through lack of sensitivity or just plain curiousness) - probably a little of both. Maybe it also has a lot to do with the fact that a lot of these trips were made on a very low budget, requiring her to improvise in stange places & strange situations.This book isn't for the faint hearted or the ultra conservative - Ms. Halliday speaks freely about drug use or bodily functions some people don't like hearing about in such frankness. But if you're willing to appreciate a good travel story combined with a good joke - this book is for you!!"
3,overall a good read,"At first I did not really like this book, but as i read on I warmed to it. The author is very witty, but at first her essays felt slightly formulaic. As it went on she began revealing more to us on a subtle level, within all the humor, and by the time it was over, I liked her & the book. Not a life-changer by any means, but entertaining & funny!"
1,Garbarge..,"Uninteresting personal soap opera on the road. Neurotic, easy city girl goes travelling. Yawn. The worse is her writing style. She has none. It's throw up on a page. No substance at all. You want to read some REAL travel adventures. Pick up Paul Bowles - a true writer. Save this book for the fire place."
2,Misleading,"This book is not funny. It's the ramblings of a whiny, self-absorbed, ambitionless person, who thinks the grass (legal or otherwise) is always greener on the other side. Getting smacked around by someone in a red-light district is funny?! Descriptions of how blitzed-out one can get is interesting?! Carrying illegal drugs in foreign countries is, what, something we should all experience?! Motherhood didn't even open Ms. Halliday's eyes to responsibility - she thinks she should be able to take her baby into pubs and whines that taking care of her own child takes her away from doing what she really wants to do! Most disappointing is the fact that Stephen Colbert has a blurb on the cover. Stephen, admit it, you didn't actually read the book. I want my money back!"
2,Not Much Substance,"In the world of travelogues which I love to read this book is about as lightweight as they come. Yes, there are some amusing passages, but nothing hysterical like some of the reviews would have you believe. I guess the writer has a lot fans, but I'm not one.I bought it because in my many visits to Japan one of my favorite things to do is visit the monkey parks. I thought there might be something about monkeys in Japan. No, nothing about Japan except I believe the author once changed planes in Narita. That's okay, there are some monkey hijinx in other parts of the world which are described. And a travel book doesn't have to be exclusively about monkeys for me to like it.All in all there are many better travel books out there including the Travelers' Tales books. I sort of doubt you'll see any of this author's writing in one of those."
1,Too bad the cover is so captivating,"I just finished the well written book, The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005, edited by Lucy McCauley which contained some wonderful travel writing, each written by a different well chosen author. Then I was presented No Touch Monkey. It, too, was chosen by the clever title and colorful cover, which promised that I would be laughing. This book is not funny or interesting (is being really dirty, sleeping on trains when you have no money, getting drunk at the Octoberfest, etc. funny and interesting?). Worse, it gives travel writing a bad name and might stop people from picking up a marvelous book, such as The Best Women's Travel Writing 2005. A bad book in a captivating cover is not a good thing."
2,What a horrible travel book...,"I got this book because the cover seemed kinda funny, and I like travel/adventure books. But all it reads as is one boring chapter after another of some immature girl travelling on the cheap; her travel tips seem to come solely from Rick Steves' books.She gives no insight on the places she's been. She tells us in a sentence she went to Dachau. Instead, she spins her yarn around her boyfriend's ""assault"" by an attendant in a men's room and the subsequent Happy Meal to cheer him up. If you want to hear about someone's adventure abroad, wouldn't you like to know what the place was like?Ayun makes a point of bad mouthing the foolish American tourist abroad but only shows herself as one of those she scorns."
2,Disappointing,I love travel essays but these are flat. They aren't so much travel stories - stories that make you laugh but also give you enough insight as to whether or not you'd like to put the place on your must-see list - as they are a journal about an odd woman who seems to revel in how cheap she is and how dirty she can get. If she loves the places she's been or the people she's met she doesn't show it. Stephen Colbert's endorsement was way off mark.
3,gut punch travelogue,"i haven't traveled nearly as much as the author, but a few of my journeys sent me to the same places. i couldn't stop smiling through those chapters, and the rest filled me with a burnin' to get on the next plane to those locales. this book is honest and quite funny."
4,The cover says it all....,I laughed out loud as I read this cautionary tale of world travel and could not put it down. The incidents with the monkeys and her description of a painful camel ride were among my favorites.....a very humorous read.
1,No Touch Book!,"This book is seriously annoying. The author comes across as a hyper hippie who just wants attention, is ignorant of pretty much all subjects such as geography (when she first hears of Surinam, she said the only Nam she'd ever heard of was Vietnam) and politics (she doesn't know why it might be dangerous to monitor political elections for a Southeast Asian military dictorship). The only thing she cares about is having a good time in the most ""LOOK AT ME!"" manner imaginable. She comes across as the kind of person who would keep interrupting other people to tell them her crazier/better/funnier story. She also comes across as the kind of person who can't be single for more than 15 seconds. And then it's a serious bummer for her when she's saddled with a kid and can't party like she used to. I am not too picky when it comes to train reading, but this was a waste of time."
1,Grottier than thou travel,"To be fair, Halliday's writing is quite good. She does rather well describing her misadventures and traveller's mistakes throughout Asia. For all that, though, it was more than a bit much to read her grottier than thou stories of hasty and much overdue washups in bathroom stalls, numerous exhaustively described accounts of dysentery, and constant attempts to score dope in the Third World. Her praise of Brits on the dole travelling in Asia chafed a bit, as well. Halliday comes across as the nightmare travelling companion. As for the hilarity, I'll have to take a pass."
2,Disappointing,"I saw someone reading this on the train. Great title, great cover, great idea.Poorly executed. I guess I expected something like ""Dave Barry Travels Abroad,"" but this book wasn't nearly as cuttingly clever as it thought it was. The vaginal references were embarrassing more than amusing, and a lot of the bathroom humor made me cringe more than laugh. It read more like a self-indulgent travel journal by someone's teenage kid trying to sound worldly and adult. It had some good bits, but not a book's worth."
5,"charming, smart, hellafunny","I'm tempted to cast aspersions upon the previous reviewers and their clearly crap taste in writing, but I suppose I should concentrate how awesome these essays are. And maybe that's the thing the other reviewers didn't get: these are essays, personal essays in the style of a David Sedaris or Sarah Vowell--not a humor column, not genre travel writing. After reading this book, I bought all Ayun Halliday's other books and subscribed to her zine."
4,Very funny,"I thought this book was well written and very funny. I bought it in the airport as I was leaving for Australia. And I left it behind for my boyfriend who really enjoyed it as well. Did I enjoy it more because I myself was traveling at the time? Possible. But either way, I think those who claim it to be awful are ridiculous. She does talk a lot about herself, but it's not a travel destination guide. It's a traveling journal of sorts. And if you're relaying your experiences while traveling, I think that it's inevitably going to be a lot about... you. Anyway, I love to read, and love to travel, and I thought it was definitely a light and fun read."
5,Balzac rules,This wholly engrossing masterpiece is as profound as it is entertaining. Balzac surely is not only one of the best writers of all time but among the smartest people who ever lived. The delineation of character(s) and observation of the human condition are literally staggering.
3,"Good, but ...","Overall, this was a good bathtub for us and served its purpose until our daughter was a little over 7 months old and outgrew it. HOWEVER ... I want to warn everyone interested in this tub that the ducky begins to take on that ""wet-sponge"" smell very quickly in spite of regular machine washings and hanging it to dry immediately after bathing (at least ours did). The tub without the ducky is pretty slippery, so I would recommend buying a non-slip mat to put in the tub instead of the ducky. You can always use the non-slip mat again when your baby transitions to the big tub."
4,Love it,"I love this tub. WE had a hard time bathing baby when she was a new born. She could not be submerged in a tub since her umbilical cord was still attached. She HATED being sponge bathed. She would scream during the whole bath every time. When we finally got this tub, she just loved bath time. We put a little water in there, and made sure it didn't reach the cord. She loved being in there.On the down side I wish it was a bit deeper, and that the leg section wasn't so raised. Once baby was big enough to sit up, that's all she wanted to do, and bath time was not excluded. She wanted to sit up in the little tub, and I just felt she could just come right out on her own, so we had to move on to the big tub. She is still quite wobbly, so we had to get a tub seat for that. But I just wish that the tub would grow with baby a little, so we could use it a bit longer. Anyhow, we enjoyed it while it lasted, and we still use the duck in the big bathroom to hold her toys. It works great!"
1,Not so satisfied,"I was really excited about this bath tub for my baby. As soon as I was done using it I would either wash it, or let it air dry. Once a week, I would even throw it in the washer. That didnt seem to help at all. I only used the tub for about 3 weeks before I threw it out. I couldnt seem to get the spongy smell out. It was disgusting!"
5,minders 'golden street',"4 1/2 stars... this album is a lot better than i expected it to be. i bought the minders first album 'hooray for tuesday' a while back, and while i thought it was a worthwhile pop album, it doesn't even come close to matching the intelligence and intensity displayed on 'golden street'. i've listened to this album everyday since i bought it (something that hardly happens these days) and it doesn't surprise me that a lot of people who fell in love with the earlier minders albums would downplay how great 'golden street' is. more than likely they were looking for something that they can bob their ""collective"" heads to and chew bubble gum while speaking in indie lingo with elitist ""friends"". there is more to the minders than that, 'golden street' is located in a complicated labyrinth of a strange city and whether you see the buildings and their inhabitants or a dot on a map is really dependant upon what you (the traveller) brings on this fantastic voyage."
5,THIS IS A GREAT LISTEN,"I've been listening to this disc since I ordered it in mid April 2001. The disc begs to be listened to in one sitting, preferably with headphones on and eyes closed. I wouldn't recommend it for someone who just wants some new music to listen to in the background while cleaning up the living room. It's a thinking person's kind of disc. Acoustic and mellow at times, very 60's Syd Barrett psyche-pop at times. I have yet to find a single flaw; OK, maybe the last song goes on a little too long. But generally, every note and cymbal tap is exactly where it should be. I only wish there was some way to get the lyric sheet. The sound, for me, is reminiscent of XTC. Also reminds me of the Zombies, or early Pink Floyd. So, if you like those guys, by all means, order straight-away!! I bought everything available by them in one order, and this one, for me, is the band's best work."
2,Not a good set up on this phone,"The phone and radio work well on this phone, and the big numbers are very helpful, but it has a very annoying feature in that the caller ID buttons are on the back of the handset, so if you, like me, ever cradle the handset between your head and shoulder, forget it because all the caller-id buttons will start ringing your ear off and interrupt your call. Same goes with putting the handset down on any counter etc. I wish I had not gotten this phone!"
1,Phone design leaves much to be desired,"The design of the phone is at best a disaster. If you put the phone down anywhere on its back, you can't help but press the caller ID button. If you cradle the phone with your shoulder, you can't help but press the caller ID button.There is only one alarm available to set. In most clock radios, there is always two alarms, so when I need to get up at one time, I set it at night and when my wife needs it later in the AM, I need to remember to reset the alarm.All in all, the space savings of a clock radio and phone is helpful, but these drawbacks have me searching for something better."
1,"Worthless, do not buy",This journal does not have a place for thumbprints which renders it useless for half of all notarial acts out there. What good is a notary journal that could not record all notarial acts? This fact alone means the journal is a defective product. Do not buy if you need to record thumbprints as well.
5,Classic notary journal and it's hardcover!,"You may be thinking, ""No big deal - it's a notary journal."" While true, it is hardcover and in the classic notary journal style. Simple to use and easy to get your clients to sign in the right spot. Some of the newer ones are softcover and have more detailed notes than are needed. Here, less is more!"
1,difficult to follow,"I bought this book hoping to find new ways to save money for my family. It was very difficult to follow and understand. I tried to come back and reread this book a couple times but it was to no avail, i just couldnt do it."
4,Impressive debut,"Swiss melodic rockers Shakra released their self-titled debut in 1998, but the old school melodic rock the album contained could have been released a decade earlier! The band's sound was quite similar to German band Bonfire and their Swiss countrymen Gotthard in that it was very upbeat and melodic, with dynamite guitar hooks and catchy sing-along choruses. You can also hear how American bands like Journey and Bon Jovi have influenced Shakra's style.Shakra is just a classy, melodic, ""party rock"" album, and was an impressive debut by a band that would only get better. Fans of bands like Gotthard, Bonfire, and Pink Cream 69 will definitely get a kick out of Shakra, and this album is a great place to start."
3,"Exhaustive theory, but inaccurate exercises","As an all-inclusive reference on Drafting theory and practice, this is as good a book as any. However: Having used it as a teaching text, I found an inexcusable number of mistakes in the end-of-chapter exercises. The dimensions simply don't stack up! My advice: Go over them yourself first, time permitting, before assigning them to your classes. Perhaps (hopefully) this has been/will be corrected in later editions. Also: Board drafting is a dying art. Thus, while opening chapters on theory and sketching methods should be retained, more emphasis must now be placed on CAD (not ""CADD""); specifically, 3D CAD and downstream processes."
4,80;s big hair? NOT HERE!,this is a fantastic album dawn and watch out for the bat are my favorites. dont look for heavy metalcovers of mott the hoople here just great music.
2,album,i was looking for a rare version of this. some sellers lead you to think it is another version with Judy Dench. That version is so much better!!!
4,Wish they had released the animated musical.,Good album... 5 stars?I think not. Glen Hughes screaches too much as always.He hits the soul once in a while but misses too often.The Dio closing should have been more Elf or Rainbow oriented instead of Beatlesque.Worth getting for Jimmy Helms alone on Waiting.
1,Barney never sang...,"The barney I ordered for my grandson never sang. I tried replacing the factory batteries, twice, however, it still did not work. I should have notified the company I brought it from immediately to give them a chance to replace it, but I was in such a rush considering Xmas was 2 days away. Once they did find out my barney did not work, they immediately refunded my purchase amount plus shipping. I would recommend them for future purchases; it was not their fault. We found out that most of the barney's from China had defective voice boxes."
4,Fun Toy for Barney Lovers,"My little girl loves barney and loves this toy, it was worth buying for sure. I personally don't like barney that much but she is learning the Barney Song with it and looks happy."
3,Barnet Sings,"The only problem is that the box that you push to get Barney to sing is not on the ""I Love You"" emblem on his stomach--it was difficult for my 18 month old to find where to ""press"" to get the toy to sing."
1,very poor quality,toy was in very poor quality voice box did not workhad battery leakage inside toy when toy arrived
3,Just another singing/talking toy,These are cute and fun and my daughter loves Barney and loves the Barney song. She plays with this every once in awhile but this is by no means one of those must-have toys.
4,Great Toy!,"I bought this toy for my 10 month old and she loves it. She tries to give Barney a great big hug to get him to sing, and it is hilarious! She isn't quite strong enough yet, but I continiue to help her. I think it is a very durable toy and I have not have a safety problems with it. The device to make him sing does tend to change its position, but it's no big deal!"
4,Not your typical CBA fare,What a fun ride. Chris Well's debut masterfully weaves humor and a Sopranos-like attitude through this well-crafted thriller. Recommended for any book fan primed to embrace both a Christian worldview as well as the cynical wit of Hiassen and/or Leonard.
3,about 3 stars...,"I started reading this book then I put it down for about a month or so. I couldn't really get into it because of the introduction. Later, I forced myself to go through and read it and it was quite interesting. I could relate with Paris's stubborness, but sometimes I just wished that she would take her guard down. Even though she stayed to herself I could tell that she wasnt happy with her life. I felt bad for the way she treated her ""suitors"" but in a way they should have respected her wishes and gave her some space. As the story progressed I began to really enjoy it and looked forward to seeing what was going to happen. However, the ending didn't really go into detail about what happened with Paris and her new lover. Overall, this book was very interesting and once you get pass the first few chapters your attention will be captured."
1,BOOOOOO!!!,"Don't let the title reel you in. This book was the worst ever, talk about a let down. I gave this book away immediately, I didn't even want it in my home."
3,Skip This One. Read another from this author!,"I really enjoy this author but this book was weak. The story starts with a ridiculus scenario and just gets worse. It seems as though the author changed the characters as she wrote the book. Catherine hated Jarrod from childhood, all he ever did was torment her. Then she has all these childhood memories of him coming to her rescue and being a great person. The characters, in general, were not well defined. But Shirley Hailstock is a good author otherwise!"
3,EXPECTED BETTER.......,I've read other books by Ms. Hailstock and truly enjoyed them. This one just did not hit the mark. I found the reasoning behind Catherine and Jarrod dilema weak. They could always move to another state or country for that matter. I finished the book because it did have some redeeming qualities that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1.
3,exactly that,"I sorta liked the book. I wanted to read it for awhile, and when I read it...it turned out alright."
1,A Waste of Money,"I was so disappointed with Ms. Hailstock's book. Terribly predictable and boring, 1-800 wife was not a book that I would recommend for a book club. The high of this book was that it was set in Newport Rhode Island and the description of setting and scenery was very vivid.The idea was unique in a time when most writers are covering the same topics. Ms. Hailstock should have taken another route to finish this one. Definitely a ""No Reader."""
5,Rottweiler: Centuries of service,This is an excellent resource for anyone thinking about or who currently owns a Rottweiler. There are lots of beautiful photo's and useful information.
2,Not the worse diet book I have ever read.,"The Howard Diet has a number of good points, but relies heavily on information copied from government food tables as a filler for the book. Dr. Howard has a program that might work for some patients, but is too permissive for others, including the weekend when the patient can eat what she pleases. The compulsive eater will probably undo all the good done in the first four and a half days with overeating in the last part of the week. Unlike some diets, his is not dangerous, but will probably not be effective long-term. His charts on body mass index and other information he supplies are accurate and well documented. He has an upbeat writing style and expresses himself well, but this book needs to be re-written and revised to make it one that can compete with other diet book authors. The present edition just doesn't quite have it."
3,Book not well received by students,We used this book to teach an introductory Java course for experienced programmers. Without exception the students didn't like the book. They felt they really couldn't learn from it--topics are covered too quickly. They wanted a text with a more step-by-step approach and one with more examples.
3,Nice to look at but don't play with it,"I was excited to see this figure in stores because I'd seen pictures of it before it's release on the internet. Well, it looks just as good in person, if not better, but if you try to handle it more than a little bit, it's limbs start to fall off. It's feet rotate around on ball joints, but if you move them more than a little bit, they're the first thing to go. The forearm only rotates at the elbows in a way that's hard to describe, but truly sucky (his arms always have to be in the ""L"" position). The arms detach at the elbows pretty easily, which is a big downer. Last of all, the weapon isn't very cool, though it seems to match the one from the movie, so I can't complain too much there. Overall, I was hoping for more...as a warrior, this guy sure can't handle much flexibility or abuse. Still, he's cool to look at, and looks pretty good on his base."
3,Babies are warm,work for keeping chicks warm a little limited to what it will clamp on to but can overcome issue
4,A laundry plus,I use my TossNGo balls in every load of laundry. My clothes smell fresh and even seem brighter that before I was using the TossNGo balls.
1,Discontinued,I made the investment in the original ball and now the product has been discontinued. Thanks Oxiclean.
2,Save your Money - use your old stained pans!,"Pan looked nice when I got it, coating seemed to be quality. I hoped I had found a pan that was nice enough to bake in and take to functions. On 1st use the lovely pan stained, apparently the coating itself and the biscuits I was cooking stuck to the pan....subsequent baking has resulted in additional stains. My 'pretty' pan is now ugly and you have to line or spray to ensure nothing sticks. I ordered add'l pans before using this one - I wish I'd saved my money, I had old stained pans that worked just as well."
5,towels,These towels are beautiful. I feel like a queen when I use them. For special occasions or company.
1,Tedious,"I did not finish it. A man gets lost, and is helped by strangers, who are having a party, and telling stories. The stories are morality tales. The first story is about a boy who does something wrong and claims the consequences of his actions are not his fault. He joins with others like him to change his action from being thought of as wrong to being thought of as right. What is the significance of this story? How does one apply this story? Are there examples of this going on today? I wish the author would add a chapter to explain this. I would read that chapter, and skip the rest of the book. If the story means that ""Man has a propensity to excuse his own behavior"", why not just say that?"
5,A Comedy of Morals,"I think this book does what a great classic like Gulliver's Travels does, namely, make you laugh and think about human ethics at the same time. So I call it a Comedy of Morals. This too-perfect main character, the attorney Brian, has everything a man needs, except the ability to laugh at himself. (Trust me, before I married I met LOTS of these guys.) He is totally out of his element when he is stranded at a house with five really lovable (and weird) characters. My favorite is the supremely ugly little German fellow, Jubal, a fool in the best sense. During the course of one night, Brian gets a crash course in not taking himself so seriously. It's a fun book, thoroughly entertaining, and I couldn't wait until the end when (I hoped) the story would reveal just who the characters really were, and why they were there."
4,To All Poor Righteous Teachers Folks (<--Fanz).........,"To Whom It May Concern,""I am feelin' Wise Intelligents' essence in Hip Hop! He never lost it. He has the flavor like artists: Juelz Santana, J.R. Writer, LHM (from Flipmode Squad), SunNY (from SoSo Def, ""Soul Of A Hustler""). I just wish he can settle down or out a contract with a major label, like the DIPSET crew has done. LHM has lyrical skills, also. For the Poor Righteous Teachers fans heres details of their 4th album:Declaration of Independence [EXPLICIT LYRICS] - Artist: Poor Righteous Teachers: Wise Intelligent, Culture Freedom, Father Shaheed--Released: 3/2001 - album is out printed. Peace."
2,Average,"You may also know this album of ""The Art of Seduction Belly Dance Music"". I almost purchased it again not realizing that it was recycled with a different cover. The CD is good when you need or want very traditional music with an emphasis on vocals. The recording is not the best. It really should have been digitally remastered before putting it out again.If you dance in a very traditional atmosphere or just want something in the back of your music collection just in case - then this is a good one.If not, skip this one."
4,A nice balance of faith and history,"Korn's book is a very cursory study of the history of the papacy, concentrating primarily on the twentieth century, but he gives a good flavor for how the role has developed. He writes as a Catholic who definitely admires the popes of recent history. The book is a good introduction to the history of the Bishop of Rome."
5,90210 Loves! IT!,Ok Im a huge Naomi Clark fan love Adrianna and Annie too! Silver this season not so much ! season 1 loved SIlver ! they Need to get SIlVer and Teddy back together they were growing up and then they reverted SIlver back to a child stealing Navid! I wish Naomi Clark still had a little back stabbing in her not to Annie though. Liam I thought has always` belonged to Naomi but Im likeing Annie and Liam just thought maybe there was a chance for Liam and Naomi. Ethan could return and Always try it again with Naomi! They need to keep the Drama going but try different things ! storylines! Keep it soap opera drama like. I loved` season 1 & 2 the best they let go one story and I thought that was so stupid of them to do!
1,Gross,"I trashed this after watching the first few episodes. What needless drama!The characters are all so good-looking on the surface but have such horrible, twisted lifestyles! So shocking to even comprehend that people can degenerate into such animals! Cheating, lying, deceiving one another all the time, never learning any lessons in life, repeating the same mistakes and spiraling into the same cycle again. Is this what America has become today? Not good for the impressionable audience to imitate! The outwardly good-looking actresses just became all the more uglier!....A totally gross series!Stay away from ""90210"".Read:Hell: The Dogma of Hell, Illustrated by Facts Taken from Profane and Sacred History plus How to Avoid Hell"
1,Jackie Chan must be getting old,"This movie was soo boring. I now know that comments about the film on the cover are all lies. In Sweden it said; ""Its so action packed it makes ""Rush Hour"" go in slowmotion"". This was only for Chan to prove that he can make a movie creep slower than a frozen snail. He rarely fights, and when he does, he doesnt do any cool moves and he lacks speed. He doesnt do any dangerous stunts anymore and he is even using special effects to do some athletic scenes in his other movie ""The Tuxedo"". He himself said ""I dont use special effect, I am the special effect"" what about now? Hope he gets better with ""Shanghai Knights"".This ... wasnt even worth to rent. He doesnt even give many laughs these days."
5,dvd,I love Jackie Chan movies. I bought this one thinking it was something else. I am very happy I found this movie. Thank you.
3,It's a fair action comedy startting Jackie Chan.,"It's a fair action comedy startting Jackie Chan. It has some funny momnents. All the action scenes look exactly like they were copied and pasted from other excellent movies of Jackie such as Supercop, etc.Because of that reason, I gave it 3 stars. I've watched it once but I don't buy it."
2,One of Jackie's rare disappointments,"Jackie Chan plays a salesman who specialises in gym equipment. His life is turned upside down when he discovers his father was a Korean double agent who had made a deal with drug dealers to make super addictive opium. Chan is assigned the task of tracking down his father, who has since defected.ACCIDENTAL SPY is mainly lacking the slapstick humor and elaborate stuntwork that are Chan's hallmarks. The movies climactic stunt featuring a flaming oil tanker mildly rips off SPEED and LICENSE TO KILL. You'd expect more originality from Chan. The movies' final ""twist"" will only surprise those who haven't been paying attention, or possess the I.Q of a NZ Green Party member. This isn't one of Chan's best, but the out takes at the end are always fun to watch and ACCIDENTAL SPY is no exception. This went direct to video in NZ. It's not hard to see why. Unfortunately this ranks alongside WHO AM I and THE PROTECTOR in the lower ranks of Jackie's portfolio."
3,"Good, but not great.","I like this film fine, and I can't truly find any fault with it. It's just seems to fall well short of Chan's usual work. That's kind of unfair, considering that most his other films are terrific, and this one is only good. But in the end, I have a hard time recommending it.The action sequences are well executed, but lacking Chan's usual flair. The end bit about a tanker truck on fire and Chan having to rescue the driver and his family is just silly. How long can that truck stay on fire without exploding? I never care for the big stunt endings. I'd rather have enjoyed a creative martial arts showdown.Not terrible, but not great either. Better than ""The Prisoner"" and ""My Lucky Stars"", two of Chan's very rare bad films. But still falls just a bit short."
5,Great Book,"I had a copy of this book when I was kid. I loved it and read it all the time. I still call my older sister - Icky Picky! And she still gets mad!!! I wish I still had my copy - I can't believe it's out of print. If you have it, hold onto it! It's a great book."
1,This is Rankin Bass???,"After years of silence, Rankin/Bass, the company responsible for such holiday staples as ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"", ""Frosty The Snowman"", ""Year Without A Santa Claus"", ""Santa Claus Is Comin To Town"" and many others, somehow managed to emerge with this terrible clunker. Gone is the Christmas enchantment that overflowed in the specials from their heydey - this depressing 1/2 hour is permeated with scenes from an impovershed ghetto. Instead of cute, charming stop-motion puppet animation, we get very cheap cel animation. I find it hard to believe that the team responsible for all those wonderful holiday classics had very much to do with this one, and I think maybe somehow their name was just tacked on it."
5,We really enjoyed it!!!,"I ran across this dvd searching Amazon for Christmas movies - I had never heard of it before! So I read some of the reviews and decided to try it. I'm so glad I did. Both my granddaughter (age 4) and I really enjoyed it! The music and the message were both excellent! Everytime I asked her what movie she wanted to see and she would say ""Santa Baby!"" Great movie!!!"
1,"How is an ugly, yellow singing bird entertaining?","Meh, this movie was kind of stupid. I didn't really care for the characters much either. The yellow singing bird should've been shot down! I hated the songs too. Check out Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer instead! It's always been better! Now to cook this yellow bird! Anyone hungry? MERRY CHRISTMAS YAS FILTHY ANIMAL AND A HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!"
2,Only for small child,"Beware this helmet is for small kids only. This helmet is described as being for youth 8-14 yrs. When we received the helmet the packaging states 5+ years and for head size up to 21 inches around. My son is 10 yrs old with a head size of 22.5"". It is way to small. Otherwise the helmet looks well made & has a nice design."
2,NOT SIZED AS LISTED,"The product would have been great, quality wise, but the ad stated it was a youth 8-14 size. What arrived was a child's 5+ size. Now I'll finally find out how well Amazon handles returns. I certainly wish the size had been correct, though, as it REALLY seems like a good helmet!042009 My refund was credited to my charge card, today, for the returned item. Excellent ""return service"" on the part of Amazon.com"
3,A nice read,"With all due respect, I think the raves in other reviews are a bit overstated, unless, like one reviewer, you're someone with a particular interest in faeries. That said, I enjoyed the book. It's a cute story, if it's still possible to use ""cute"" non-perjoratively about something other than a small child or animal. The characters are likeable, if not particularly deep. The story moves easily. There's nothing of great substance here, but a pleasant book to read on a lazy weekend if you're not feeling up to, say, Gaddis."
4,Delightful,"This novel harks back to the joy you felt as a child reading C.S Lewis' Narnia series. Mixed in with a bit of first world war Britain.The author has taken the Cottingdale Fairy myth and added some magic. The film is also one that any child will delight in and the ending, without giving it away is tidy.I'd strongly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in the faerie realm, or a young child who is wide-eyed and loves to her stories about magic, love, and, above all, fairies."
5,This is my new favorite book,"I definatly approve of this book. I was drawn in and each chapter pulled me into the next. I fully recomend it, allthough the ending had me a little depressed, but not because it was disapoiting. Read it!"
5,Best Civil War Minutes To Date!,This DVD box set shows what can be done when you take the time to get the history right! I found the first DVD to be chock full of interesting episodes based around the Battle of Gettysburg. The 2nd DVD rounds out the set with stories of valor from throughout the Civil War - some of the episodes feature things this Civil War buff did not know! Be sure to check out the commentary tracks for added insight!
4,Very Well Done and interesting,"I thought this was a very well done documentary..I would of given it 5 stars, perhaps, but I've just finished Ken Burns again and that is the gold standard in my opinion. This set was well done and very educational and informative, the images are outstanding as is the content. A welcome addition to any Civil War collection."
5,Great History,I am always intruiged by the depth of the Civil War. There are so many stories that you could learn for days. These two DVD's are filled with just some of those stories. After watching them I found myself rethinking some of the things I heard.
5,Great CD to own,This is one of the best trombone quartets I have ever heard. Great choice of music and all of it is performed well. If you like music this is a CD you should own. I really enjoyed listening to the CD.
2,Disappointing,"I really like Liza Minelli, but this CD is so disappointing. Her rendition of Love for Sale is almost unbearable. And I really didn't need a French version of Liza with a Z. God Bless The Child is an insult to Billie Holiday."
5,My 9 year-old reluctant reader is begging for this one...,"although she normally only enjoys fiction! She's giggling with excitement with every chapter and can't stop talking about this book! If you have have a reluctant history student and want to *spark* an interest in Ben Franklin's life and work, *experiment* with this excellent Landmark that reads more like a story than a biography!"
4,Hot stuff!,"There's some seriously hot playing on this double CD. I give it 4 stars because it claims to be a complete concert - but it's not. For a collector like me, trimmed songs and replacement (aparently they were better audiio quality) songs from other gigs does not a complete gig make. Why do they force us to chase bootlegs with the whole show?However, that aside the band is in fine form and the improvising is as sharp as ever. Very cool version of Stormbringer.Excellent live album for fans."
2,"Glenn Hughes ""attempt at singing"" ruins this one for me","Glenn Hughes' voice was obviously shot by this final leg of the tour, so instead of maybe just shutting his mouth or taking it easy, he still ""tries"" to sing. But it must hurt with the vocal chords being that worn out. So he instead howls and shouts and does a good job of mucking up most of the vocal sections he shares with Coverdale. Most notably ruined; Stormbringer & Burn.Great live set otherwise, especially when they do songs where Glenn's vocals are not necessary. It is reasonably priced for a 2CD set, but look for a used copy first if this sub-par vocal performace has you feeling wary."
4,Sink Daisy,The product is of good quality and does the job required. The red color is a delightful change and brightens up the sink. The gentle aroma (apple cinnamon) is pleasant while working around it. All in all I am pleased with the product and would get another when needed.
4,Good basic overview...,"This is more of an overview of basic dog training, but I was hoping for a bit more in-depth ""how-to."" I did like that he showed how confusing it is to our dogs when we first begin giving commands that they don't understand. Excellent demonstration. Also, that he made the training fun for both the dogs and their human counterparts."
5,A keepsake book,"I am very happy with the quality of the condition of this book. I was pleasantly surprised because I did not pay much for it. As an ABA with the Estee Lauder Minneapolis team, I have shared this book with other makeup artists."
1,A bad autobiography,Estee wasgood at cosmetics. She was not a good writer. This is as close to unreadable as it gets
1,WARNING: FULL OF LIES!!,"George Geftakys is the founder of a Christian cult called the ""Assemblies of George Geftakys"". To find out the full story, google ""Assembly Reflections"". He was excommunicated from his own group for serious sin. His teachings in this book are GRAVELY in error. This is spiritual poison, pure and simple. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!"
3,Expected more...,".... from this book. I have a two yr old and we have travelled quite a bit and I was really expecting something that I was going to go ""Wow, what a great idea"". Maybe there is nothing new out there, or maybe this book tries to cover too many age groups and too many travel circumstances. But I really didnt come away with any new ideas. Guess it may be of interest to people with new babies."
5,Breaking into the pot business the hard way,"If you liked Sabbag's previous work ""Snowblind"", you'll enjoy this one every bit as much. Tracking the career of an erstwhile smuggler, Sabbag gives us a fascinating and humorous look into the would-be criminal's misadventures. The author has a delightful way of describing the characters the smuggler meets along the way, making this book a real page-turner. Highly recommended."
2,Tried twice.....,"I owned this book for a year and tried to read it twice to no avail. Sabbag is a good writer but the book just jumps around way to much and is just BORING in spots. I have read quite a few books on the subject and the story of this is just way out there. I don't care how ""charming"" Long was. The story is just to much to believe. Personally I liked ""Weed Man"" and ""Contrabando"" much more."
5,Love this song,"Hey,I think everyone needs to buy this song because it's reminds me of Soda Pop by Britney but that is how I see it. It's has a wicked beat and I just love the wayt he song is done it great. All songs done by Shakira is good the woman is very good at what she does. She will be here for a long time and she is not going anywhere anytime soon so bring the popcorn and sit on the sofa for a ride for your life."
1,Terrible translation,"This is the worst translation into English from any language I have ever read. Totally unidiomatic, whether in 16th-century or 21st-century English. It reads like a bad machine translation. If it were free, it would be laughable; at $.95, the joke's on me."
