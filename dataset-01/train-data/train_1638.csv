4,Nursing mommy necessity,"This bra is simple, practical and comfortable enough to wear to sleep. I also found that the quality was better than the Medela sleep bra. I didn't give it 5 stars because it's quite expensive for such a simple bra."
1,Not what I was looking for,"It's ugly and I just don't like it. From the picture it looked more like a sports bra, but in person there is a seam on the front panels and it just looks bad. I will be returning this purchase."
4,Super comfortable nursing bra. May not be supportive enough for larger cup sizes,"First let me start by saying I find this nursing bra to be very comfortable, and it makes nursing a breeze. It is easy to open for nursing and snap closed with one hand ( a necessity in a nursing bra in my opinion). You do have to put in on overhead, which is a bit of a pain sometimes. The material is soft and breathable. At about a B-C cup I find it supportive, but I'm not sure larger cup sizes would."
2,"Not soft, itchy","I purchased this to use as a sleep bra. I own the Bravado Seamless Silk Nursing Bra and expected similar quality in this bra. Unfortunately, the fabric on this was scratchy, stiff, and not very soft. The band on the bottom is uncomfortable as well. I found the Seamless Silk Nursing Bra to be much more comfortable to sleep in. I'd recommend paying the extra 10 bucks or so and buying the Seamless Silk Nursing Bra."
4,supportive,"I'm happy with the purchase, i wear this bra all the time, and have ordered more. I just wish the design was more feminine, it's really an ugly bra."
4,Comfortable,"A bit hesitant to purchase based on some of the reviews. Arrived today, tried it on and found it to be very comfortable."
2,not for me,I have ordered MANY nursing bras online and had a lot of trouble finding one that fit right. I am large breasted but small around and this bra gave me a giant uniboob and was too tight around. I returned this and got Bravado Designs Body Silk Seamless Nursing Bra and LOVE the new one it is so comfortable and perfect fit I have ordered two more!
2,Sizing unclear,I bought the wrong size in this bra b/c the sizing info on this site was off. Here is what the packaging says about sizing:Small = 32-36 BSmall+ = 32-36 C-DSmall++ = 32-36 DD-FMedium = 36-40 B-CMedium+ = 36-40 D-DDMedium++ = 36-40 DD-GLarge = 38-42 C-DLarge+ = 38-42 DD-ELarge++ = 38-42 E-GXLarge = 42-46 C-DXLarge+ = 42-46 DD-EXLarge++ = 42-46 E-G
4,Maximum coverage for those of us busty girls!,"This looks huge, and it does provide MAX coverage, but it is a great bra. I use this at night as a nursing bra (It covers the whole breast so when you get engorged it doesn't cut into you like some of the demi styles do). It also give some additional support unlike a lot of the night-time nursing bras do, which also helps keep the pads in place while you sleep (although I haven't found anything that works perfect yet)."
5,For audiophiles,"One of the most fantastic discs you can own for sound/recording quality. Produced through the once infamous telarc records, it doesn't get much better than this!!!!!"
2,Wonderful quality but definite 80's vibe,"Ok, I was sucked in by the lure of a new soundtrack for spy capers. The Telarc studio story really should be read by any music appreciator. Look it up, it's a shame they are no longer active. I don't have good sound equipment, but this CD did sound great on what I had. Here's the caveat. The CD release date is 1988, and the music is very much a product of its time. Lots of electronic keyboards and I was really not expecting vocals. This is not what I consider spy music.The sound quality is truly amazing though."
3,Not my favorite,I have to read this for a young adult literature class and so far I haven't been able to get interested in it.
1,you get what you pay for,"If you expect these bino's to perform like the one they are trying to copy, don't bother buying them. In fact they're not worth half of the amount asked for. I've had a chance to look through them and the optics are mediocre at best. The rubber has a funny smell and although I did not drop them, they seem fragile and not as rugged as they look in the photo."
2,"Good replacement, not the best",Small size that I thought would be a great idea. I am always looking for it. It takes a bit to get the lights to dimm sometimes; I find my self having to get close to the transmitter so that I gets the remote reception. Not the best for a quick replacement for my broken remote
1,Don't buy - doesn't work,"The part I received does not work but but to get it replaced I have to pay to ship it back and include a check for shipping of a replacement. After paying shipping 2 more times I will have had to pay for this thing twice, and there's still no guarantee the 2nd part will function properly. I've decided to cut my losses and throw the remote away. Don't waste your money. They obviously don't have very good quality control and an even worse warranty policy."
1,Very poor range,"I already have the RKR24 2-unit remote and the range is exactly what I need. I have the receiver plugged into an outlet in the loft of our barn and with the RKR24 I can turn the outside barn lights on from inside the house (easily 50 feet away). But with this 4-unit remote (KR22A), I have to be in the barn for the receiver to get the signal. If the 2-unit remote will suit your purpose, get that one instead."
1,X10 continues as usual,This thing never worked and it is too cheap to bother returning. Other X10 remotes that I have work well but the buttons wear out quickly and now you must press very hard to activate them. X10 has had a quality problem for years. Many of their modules don't work well for very long. I'll try a different brand next time. X10 is the cheapest but maybe this is a situation where you get what you pay for.
1,Worthless,"By the time you take away the bibliographical information, this article is about a thousand words and contains little more than the dust jacket of one of her books. Don't waste your time or money with this one."
3,Very Small,"stocking stuffer for my toddler she has no idea who gumby and pokey are but I was running out of ideas, and I used to get one in my stocking as a kid. Smaller than i thought they would be, but they'll do."
3,Same as when I was a kid.,"What can you say. It's like what I had in the 70's as a kid but the plastic is slightly different and the colors a little brighter. My kids, 2 and 4, like it but not love it and it gets played with about as much as any other toy in the house. The best thing I can say is it has not real negative points to it."
3,There must be better phones out there.,"I've had this phone for over a year and have been pleased with all aspects of it except for the reception. I do not use it over a wide area range. However, the phone never fails to fade out temorarily during a conversation. This has happened both in my current and my previous apartment. I also use a Sony SPP-D900 which I've had since '97 and although it has fewer features, it remains consistently reliable and clear (and is still running on the same battery as when I first bought it)."
4,"Very good, but live is always better.","I purchased this recording after recently attending a live performance for the first time. We were actually sitting on stage in the corner in front of the chorus and behind the percussion and pianos of the orchestra. Watching and listening to all the fireworks from that perpective of course makes any recording a letdown. Robert Shaw was a master choral conductor and I have most all of his choral recordings with the Atlanta Symphony. After reading other reviews, I purchased the Leonard Slatkin/St Louis Symphony recording of Carmina Burana. You hear more of the percussion in it which is more like what I heard on stage. I'm waiting to receive the surround sound DVD version. Hope it let's me get even closer to reliving that live performance."
3,Not enough energy,"I will not repeat the correct observations of others about this recording vis a vis being less than dynamic.However, the amazon.com review that states this has rudimentary orchestration is completely wrong. This piece is totally inventive in its use of orchestral and choral forces throughout."
2,Just Awful!,"This version of the Carl Orff masterpiece cruises along acceptably until the tenor solo. I had to take the CD out of the player to see if there was something wrong with it. It's just painful to listen to. Instead of this version, I would suggest either the Leonard Slatkin/St. Louis Symphony or the more recent version with Christian Thielemann/Duetsche Oper Berlin. Both treat the piece with the wild abandon and exitement it deserves and, more importantly all the soloists give fine performances in both versions."
3,"I like them, baby did not","I bought these because I liked the idea of one piece silicone design, but our baby did not take to these. She likes the Nuk brand and the Born Free ones."
5,outstanding resource...and lots of fun!,"this book is amazing! i teach middle school (6-7-8) english, and i use these puzzles with my students. they can't get enough! for any fans of the npr sunday morning puzzle, this book is a must."
3,It Could have been better,"I don't mean to get anyone mad but this box set could have been better. In Bubble Crisis 2032 they'er already a team. A family member was not robot,and one of Saber Knights was not mental weak. I was disappoined with upgrade of this anime. But Bubble Crisis 2040 should have left after 2032 but it just my option. Other than that anime still hold it own. So if youare a fan of Bubble Crisis you should than."
5,Highly recommend this series!!,"Well....I am going to keep this short and sweet, this is a great series and if you are a fan of action adventure anime, this is for you.In a nutshell...the animation is generally very good, although it does sort of trail off in a few of the lst episodes. The main strengths are the fleshing out of the world the characters themselves live in, the music (the several different soundtracks are awesome), and mainly the characters themselves. You just gotta root for the girls.Not going to be longwinded, but I love this series, it is one of my favorites. I think you probably will too, if you are even looking at these review things at all. Enjoy!"
3,A fine series,"I had to buy the collection due to Netflix not having the DVDs. The anime is okay, but the ending is terrible. The never bother to make the sequel."
4,Decent Quality,"As always, Amazon got this to me right away, made a good first impression. I was re-doing a cramped office, and the fact that it fits just right helps, too. The fasteners were taped to the side of the cabinet, and made some pretty serious scratches, and one of the corners was busted a bit. Nothing I think about now, but enough to prevent me from giving it 5 stars."
4,Re-Inventing Life - One Man's Cause For Self-Transformation,"Written through pain and with literary reflection, Wayne Tefs has provided an excellent resource for those struggling with a life-threatening challenge.Tef's struggle is with a slow-growing cancer, which he acknowledges as ""the worst possible thing that could happen to a person."" His angst is further compounded by the realization that his cancer is, in fact, him, and a prerequisite to healing demands nothing less than a complete re-evaluation and restructuring of his life.In this emotionally taxing journey for the author as well as those close to him, Tefs recounts the pain, fear, and rage that accompany him on his quest to deal with the single most important aspect of his life - his continued existence. As a confessed optimist, however, Tefs always leaves one with the spiritual support of hope, related with indomitable courage.For those who would seek wisdom about life's trials, this volume has much to recommend."
5,There will be dragons ... but not in this book,"The dragons show up in the sequel, the 2 nd of the trilogy. I agree with the other reviewer, this is a 4.5 star book. I really, really like the premise of this book. The internet ""grows up"" into Mother who knows when a leaf falls in the forest and when a bird dies. But, the old adage, who shall guard the guardians ? When the guardians of Mother, the council, have a falling out, literally all hell breaks loose on this planet wide ""garden of eden"". For in this future possibility, not only did the people eat the apple of knowledge, they also ate the tree of everlasting life. But, just like the Garden of Eden, the people were cast out into the wilderness. Just a great story. In fact, I change my mind, I am maing this 5 stars instead of 4."
3,Interesting Start,"The book is an interesting beginning to a series that bridges the gap between Science Fiction and Fantasy. The future of the Series would seem to be predictable but the way the author attacks the situations will be the telling part.I to have enjoyed the ""Posleen"" series and the ""March To"" series and also found that they ran out of steam towards the end. I hope that this does not happen in this series.The series seems to be developing on two tracks, one track with the people displaced by the war (read the Mortals) and the other track with those causing the war (read the Gods), with people who talk with the ""Gods"" being the leaders of the ""Mortals"" possible future ""Wizards"".If the author can keep the action going without being bogged down in detail, like ""The March to the Stars"" this could be a great series, but I have been burned by the author before."
4,Extremely interesting new series,"This book begins in a confusing manner for someone expecting more 'yellow gore'. But as I continued, it didn't take long to be drawn in and captured by Mr Ringo's fast-paced plots and interesting characters.As always, his action scenes are first-rate, and plot twists well-planned.As is true of all of Mr Ringo's books, BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE! If you want a fairy-tale, look elsewhere. But if you want a gritty story of people persevering against incredible odds, then this book will satisfy. By the end of this book, I was anxiously awaiting it's sequel."
1,Pity--it could have been good.,"Some interesting ideas unfortunately combined with failure to explore them or even consistently bear them in mind during world building and plot construction. Lumps of awkward exposition, especially near the beginning, are interwoven with a Mary Sue story written for adolescent males. Plenty of 2nd amendment propaganda, but no mention of the 13th, 15th or 19th amendments, which would actually have applied to the situation. Basic facts about the real world (which serves as history for the story-world) are conveniently forgotten or overlooked.If you are a militaristic fifteen year old boy, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, there are better ways to spend your time."
4,There Will Be Dragons,"I love the premise. The survivalist method of taking a society that had it all and making them come to terms with needing to learn how to survive. The folks who did survival as a hobby ended up being the ones to lead the masses to safety, etc.I am nearing the end of this novel and find it a great work."
5,Where Are The Dragons?,"We have everything else in this book, but no dragons. A first-rate, fast paced story with characters you care about, a fantasy world totally based on science, humor, action villains(except for one) who have understandable motives, and told in a way that you can't put it down. What's not to like?There may be dragons in the following books, but they don't show up here. This is a minor nit, but I heartily recommend the book to those who like science fiction, fantasy, military science fiction, and history."
4,A Shocking Tale,"Want to lose what little remaining faith you have in the human race? Then I've got a book for you. Detailed results and narratives from the famed Milgram experments. At about 250 pages, it's extremely thorough and thoroughly soul-destroying. On a scale of from 15 to 400 volts, I give this 320."
2,It's okay,"I thought having a case that is flexible, durable, and provided protection would be nice...and this was all those. In the end, I just didn't like it."
5,Neat stand,"My decision to purchase this stand was based on the unanimous great reviews from the strobist blog. I have used it primarily for indoor shoots at home and have found it extremely reliable and sturdy. Somehow, it did not fare well outdoors (falling down a couple of times, thankfully no casualties..) with the Vivitar 285 and the 43"" westcott umbrella on top of it. You may have to buy some sandbags to weight it outdoors. The stands extends very smoothly and feel very professionally made even though it is light.I would totally recommend it for the beginner strobist. Actually, I am going to go in for my second one as I write this review."
5,"Strobist, the best.","Sturdy, Portable. Start with this and you will never look at another stand unless you got bigger lights than off camera flash."
4,Decent Portable Stand,"This lightweight stand has worked well for on location use. However, I have to carry weights with me to stablize so it doesn't blow away or get knocked over easily. I bought cheap 5lb ankle weights to wrap around the base."
1,Wouldn't recommend,"This item was posted on line as a 3373 with only 5 left in stock leading one to believe that it was a close out of the Bogen 3373. It wasn't. They substituted two Manfrotto units. In place of the 3373's.If i had to do it over again I would go to B&H; and order the Smith Victor UK2 umbrella kit SKU SMUK2.Lower price, two better stands, two umbrellas, two umbrella/camera clamps and a carrying case included for less then the Manfrotto stands alone. Umbrellas have a removable black backing,You will need a order a cold shoe and I would recommend a stroboframe clamp/shoe. They are beveled at the bottom so they will not short out the pins on the bottom of the flash. Watch out for shipping charges if you order the clamps on Amazon."
2,Horrificly out of date.,This book is interested and really one of the only of it's kind but it is so sadly out of date that it's hard to get past all of the dated material to get to the facts. It walks you through the apparel manufacturing process from designer to factory to store and everything in between. It's too bad they haven't updated this book because with some tweaking it would be really good.
2,Should be more detailed and insghtful,"I finished the book, however it is a pretty shallow book, which gives just a smell of fashion business, not the substance."
3,EZ'S BERET,"THIS BERET IS WAY TO LIGHT FOR REAL WINTER COLD. I JUST HAND WASHED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME AND FOUND SOME THREADS UNRAVELING. WONDERFUL, HUH? THIS BERET IS FOR THE SPRING NOT THE WINTER. REALLY NICE COLOR."
1,Parkhurst 10.5 Inch Cotton Knit Beret,"I have not tried this beret but I have a friend who recommened trying it.I need four (4) more black beret as soon as possible. Will you be gettingany more in soon? This isn't really a review, but a request.1 August 2008 My rating on this product should have been 5 stars not 1. I checked the wrong star."
2,Not great for a Ryan Adams fan.,"I bought this since I'm a huge Ryan Adams fan thinking I'd like his first debut as a producer. It is alot more Country/Folk than I expected. Probably amazing if you really are into Willie Nelson, but I was hoping for something that had duets with Ryan Adams and Nelson but it isn't that. It's basically a straight up Willie album, so if you love him, well this is probably for you."
1,And this sold????,"I've had this CD for a while and just got around to playing it. I've alway's like Willie, but now, not too sure. The Band was too loud and overshadowed Nelson, and Willie sounded like was either in agony, or sitting in the 5th row back enjoying a bottle of Jim Beam. His tone was bad, his pitch seemed way off and I had trouble trying to understand the words, slurred???The CD is going into the trash can."
3,Not what I expected,"As a Willie Nelson fan you will always appreciate Willie's artistry and talent no matter how it is packaged. I was disapointed in the production value of this album. In many places I find myself straining to hear Willie's vocals over the backing music. To me the arrangements were not suited to Willie's style and talent. I couldn't make it through Stella Blue - not my style of music at all and not what I expected to hear on a Willie Nelson album. The songs Willie wrote are good and he can sing just about anything if you let him do it his way but, I would not recommend purchasing this album if you are like me and just want to hear Willie, his guitar and the Family Band."
2,Willie is better than this,"Looking forward to another nice Willie Nelson album, we were so disappointed. His voice can barely be heard, but the instrumentation is right out front. We don't buy his albums for the band. It's his voice that draws us. Happily, this kind of mess doesn't happen very often. I told all my friends and relatives not to buy it."
4,ryan makes willie sound really great,"i'm not a big willie nelson fan, but ryan adams is my fave artist and his production of this album is amazing. you can definetly tell songbird has ryans touch to it and the cardnals as the backing band. to me its as good of any willie nelson album i have ever heard. the standout to me is by far blue hotel written by ryan and willie makes it sound really good. fans of ryan adams and the cardnals will definetly be pleased."
2,"I love Willie, but this is DREADFUL","It's NOT my imagination. At NO time during this album does Willie -- when you can hear him over the band -- sound as though he's having a good time (and I forced myself to listen to whole thing TWICE just to be sure). There are only two potential keepers: ""Yours Love"" and ""Sad Songs and Waltzes."" But they're not even worth the price of a second-hand album. Album credits ought to read: ""The Cardinals, with background vocals by Willie Nelson"" -- expect it the other way around, and you'll be disappointed."
3,"Poor Shipping, Great Product. Be ready to fix them","This is a great industrial fan that will move a lot of air, however, when you recieve it have a flat head screw driver and a hammer ready. Their is no protection what-so-ever in the box for the fan and it gets pretty mangled during shipping. You WILL have to remove the front guard and use a hammer to beat out the sidewalls round again. They should definatly put more quality into their shipping process. The fans still work great but you will have to work on them first."
2,"Good list of trails, poorly organized book","While this book has a lot of trails in it, I find it to be so poorly organized that it is almost unusable. Instead of organizing by region (i.e. Western NC, Piedmont, Eastern, etc.) the author chose to organize by the type/owner of the trail. For instance, trails are grouped by whether they are a National Park trail, National Forest trail, County Trail, State trail. I would never think to look up a trail that way and it makes it hard to find trails in a specific area. When picking a trail, I think of the region I am going to and then I want to see a list of all the trails in the region. Only after narrowing down that way might I care about who is responsible for the trail, so as to figure out how well maintained the trail is, perhaps."
3,My favorite Erasure song but not my favorite remixes,"I had a lot of expectations with the remixes for my personal favorite Erasure song. ""Fingers & Thumbs (Cold Summer's Day)"" is so irresistably catchy, I'm constantly playing the song over and over a few times at work when I bring the duo's self-titled album to work. I always thought the song would sound great remixed. Now that I have the second part of the two cd remixes for the song, I must say I was left a bit annoyed that the remixes left a bland taste on my mouth. Out of the three remixes of ""Fingers & Thumbs"", I liked the Tin Tin Out Remix. That's probably because the vocals remain intact and no annoying dub beats like on the Dub On the Moon mix. The unavailable track ""HI NRG"" was cheesy and mediocre for Erasure. Hopefully someday I can find the other half of the two cd set of remixes for my favorite Erasure song 'cause part two disappointed me."
3,Good but..,The book has lots of diagrams that explain the various topics.I like the classification of webservices into primary SOA (basic web services standards) and the contemporary SOA (what comes with web services extensions to support SOA).I just find that the author sometimes repeats himself.and this is why I rate it 3 stars and not 4In general it is a very good reference.
1,It is a field research book and not practical,"This is a SOA introductory book on concepts, design and technology. It is long winded and repetitive. The content of the book is based on industry research and not the author's experience in SOA. In some parts of the book the author encourages forward thinking. At the same time, the author discourages excessive forward thinking and upfront design. If the SOA project is run like an agile project, many of the problems captured in this book won't be an issue. This book will confuse for those who are new to SOA."
2,Too much theory,"I found reading this book boring after the first 6 chapters. What would have been more interesting is the author giving possible solutions (i.e. specific products) that could meet the specifications he laid out in each chapter. This book does not give specific real-world solutions that fit the descriptions and specifications that are described as constituting a Service-Oriented Architecture. After reading this book, I understand the architecture, but could not recommend any specific products that would fit the architecture."
2,"Verbose, Mostly High Level Concepts","This book might be best described as SOA for managers. Most of the book covers high level concepts. In some parts everything is presented as an abstraction, leaving the reader to wonder what the connection with the real world is.Even as a book focused on a high level overview this book doesn't work. This should have been a 300 page book. Who has time to put up with an extra 400 pages?If your interest is in actually implementing something, you'll need to go far beyond this book. I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did learn a few things from it."
1,"Like a really, really long survey of SOA standards","If you want a book that covers most of the SOA standards in one place, this might be helpful. I think you could get that from Wikipedia. Lots regurgitation of SOA platitudes, not much value add. If you're looking to make the light go on about key SOA concepts, this isn't the book. It would make a good management summary of the technology, if it was about 1/3 as long."
1,Not much practical information,"This is a high level book with lots of high level diagrams and pointers to the author's web site for more information. Redundant and not very useful. A much better technical introduction to SOA isService Oriented Architecture For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech)); for business perspective, tryService-Oriented Architecture (SOA): A Planning and Implementation Guide for Business and Technology."
2,Simple concepts are expressed in overly complicated manner.,I have read 30% of this book and I'm sure not going to by another one by Thomas Erl.Descriptions are repetitive.Simple concepts are expressed in overly complicated manner and many explanations are unnecessary.For example I do not think that concepts:- AtMostOnce- AtLeastOnce- ExactlyOncedeserve a separate picture for each scenario.If author have spent more effort on keeping explanations concise and to the point the book could be 25% (or less) of its size without sacrificing any content and readability would be improved.
3,Nice... could be better.... bad examples,"Although 70% is just spec description, this book has nice concepts if you dig enough. If you need something on SOA this is the best material available now, even if it's not that good. I'd rather read it online than buy it.Just skim the technology stuff (if you want technology read manuals or specs) and PLEASE forget the example on the car washing stuff, it's really totally nonsense..."
4,SOA by Erl,I have used this book very successfully in a 4th year level course on SOA and web services. The book provides an excellent overview of principles to be adhered to and current standards and specifications. There are very useful practical examples that can be used to explain complex scenarios.
3,Exhausting!,"The book provides an excellent description of the concepts, technology, and methodology of service-oriented computing. The case study gives a lot of useful examples and code that make the concepts concrete. The topics develop nicely from simple ideas to concrete implementations. However, the material could be covered in about half the space. I often found myself turning page after page in order to find the next useful idea or example."
2,a real snoozer,"booooring. if you are enough in this field to put down nearly $50 for this book, save your money and your time because you probably already know more than this book can teach. I was looking for some hard answers to some of the architectural forces I face. No help here.This book is completely lacking in concrete material. It's all very fluffy, and sifting through each and every page while going nowhere was painful.Also, I was irate at the promise of 125 case studies only to find out THESE COMPANIES ARE FAKE! MADE UP!!! What could possibly be demonstrated when the author gets to make up the happy ending?And yes, I have ""Service Oriented Architecture, A Field Guide..."" by the same author as well, which is pretty awesome.Sorry to rip your book Mr. Erl but I am feeling like someone just stole $50 from me."
2,Vacuous,"I gave this book some harsh reviews three weeks ago. Doubt and uncertainty about my assessment crept in as I kept reading all the other glowing reviews. So I gave it another try. And I found out I was being unfair. The book is in fact worse than I originally thought. Its littered with childish diagrams and metaphors who do nothing but add to the page count. The font and spacing are also cleverly crafted to increment book mass rather than understanding. It is painful to read as the author dilutes his meager message with summaries and overviews and summaries of overviews. I cannot even tell if the book is accurate because the information contents are so slim as to take hours to extract the smallest sliver of knowledge. Readers looking for succinct, honest or well reasoned material will be sorely disappointed. I would recommend instead they look at ""Enterprise SOA"" by Krafzig et al."
5,Great Sounding Recording,"Wow! I just downloaded this and it is an amazing recording and performance. Everybody should own a recording of the Four Seasons, and this is a really good one. Love the Bonus Track"
4,First purchase. Seems to work.,"This is the first time I've used a product such as this one. With a lot of cats, this seems to be working, because our eyes have stopped watering! I plan to order again. I'll have a more definitive review after the next order."
4,Don't stop using it!!,"I like this stuff, my bunny's enclosure is in my room so it CANNOT be smelly!!!! I began giving this to her at 6 months old. I went home to visit my parents and forgot it- she stated going crazy, peeing on everything and being aggressive. It may be because she was not used to the way she was smelling. I don't know, maybe they are not related. It works as it says it does, eliminates most odors but don't stop using once you start!"
2,Did not receive this product,"This product is absolutely wonderful.I have a large white rabbit and with this product I do not smell him or his urine/feces at all.That being said, I gave this product only two stars because when I ordered it last week Amazon sent me Marshall's GoodBye Odor instead of this Bi-Odor product which does not work nearly as well.I'm hoping they still have the Bi-Odor in stock or I'm going to be living with a very stinky rabbit!UPDATE: Returned the Goodbye odor to Amazon to try to get the Bi-Odor sent to me instead and they sent me the GoodBye Odor again!! Needless to say I am very unhappy and I do not recommend ordering this product from Amazon!"
3,Not really sure it's working too well,"I used this product faithfully for 2 months in my rats water and didn't notice a distinguished difference in smell, perhaps just a little. :("
4,The Smell of the Cage went down,"All you do with this product is put a squirt in the animals water when you refill it. It is very easy and it actually works! The smell of my hampster cage has went down. There is still a faint odor, but nothing compared to how the smell was before this product."
1,"new formula, don't waste your money","below was my old review, sadly this is a new formula and it does not work. The old formula worked great but it's strange they would change the formula. back to changing the litter constantly.I have a house rabbit who shares my bedroom so I really want to keep it odor free. This stuff is fantastic! It will pay for itself because youwon't have to buy as much litter. It lasts a really long time. It takesa few days to start working, somehow it removes the amnonia smell from the urine."
1,"Worthless, horrid product","I ordered Bi-Odor but was shipped the WORTHLESS, INEFFECTIVE GoodBye Odor instead. The products are completely dissimilar, with totally different ingredients. Needless to say, I was distressed. Still, having had excellent results with Bi-Odor, I decided to give GoodBye Odor a try. What a disaster. The best that I can say about this awful product is that it didn't harm my animals. Please note that both Bi-Odor and GoodBye Odor, despite being completely different formulations, are listed by Marshall with the same item number: FS-221 and the original formulation (Bi-Odor) seems to have disappeared from retail."
4,Excellent teaching.,"She's a good teacher! Although, the tool used is not the correct tool for professional finishes. Other than that, I think this book is worth the price. She does show you step by step techniques which makes this book valuable. I always refer back to it. Remember, although these books show you step by step techniques, yours will never come out the same way."
3,I hope they got it right this time,I agree with most of the other reviewers that season two contained several of the best episodes of Vice ever. I've been really anticipating this release. I just hope that the quality of the transfer is better this time and really does the content justice. The quality of the season 1 discs was just awful - random pixellation and sound drop outs in many many scenes. Given the time between releases you can't say that they rushed this edition to market.
5,Looking forward to it!,"Like all of you that are waiting for the release of the MIAMI VICE: SEASON TWO DVD, I'm very excited about it.P.S. To reply to Vincent's review of the DVD set, the episode where in one scene Crockett's black car gets blown to smithereens is ""When Irish Eyes are Crying"". That episode is from the THIRD season, not the second season. Just thought you'd like to know..."
4,miami still on the top,"I watched theses DVD and I have to say the show is still excellent.Even, they don't use cell phones ...Cars are still nice ... better than in my memory.I love it."
2,Picture Quality of the DVD is awful,"I agree with the previous reviewers that Season 2 of Miami Vice was one of their strongest seasons, and I am enjoying the episodes. Still, there is no denying that these releases are of very very poor quality, resembling something you would expect from bootleg copies bought from the street. There are NO special features at all. The picture quality is a miserable transfer, heightened by the high quality DVD picture of a miserable transfer. This is a cheap quality production. I guess they spent all their money getting the music rights, and ran out of cash when it came to producing a clean picture, with extras. For die hard Miami Vice fans only. Hopefully someday we'll get a quality redo of this mess."
1,The seller of this product,"I bought this product as a gift to my brother. It said it was 97% and was only missing the outter cover but it was in good shape and played. I thought cool because I had a week to return it. I was embrassed when my brother tried to watch it all the disc's skip and the second disc was so badly scratched it didn't even register on the dvd player or x box. Of course the week had already passed so I'm stuck with this very badly damaged copy. Be ware of the company that sold this to me, make sure you check your product within the required time, or it might happen to you"
4,Miami Vice Season 2,"Great! No trouble with my DVD player reading this season, unlike the first season which skipped right out the box."
1,Got the Miami Vice Blues!,"Miami Vice Season 2 is a great show, great episodes - BUT - The actual quality of the DVDs is terrible. I ordered the season from Australia only to find that many of the episodes pixilate, skip, or simply don't play at all! I have tried the DVDs on several Computer DVD drives and stand alone DVD players only to find the same problem. It is such a shame that a legendary show like Miami Vice is being authored so badly on DVD. You have been warned."
4,Shows Great - DVD Not So Great,"Probably my favorite show of all time. I have the first season and it works perfectly. The second season set is another story. There are little glitches that I can live with, but Disc 3, Side 2 is a different story. The last 10 minutes or so of ""Trust Fund Pirates"" and the entire ""Sons and Lovers"" will not play. I tried them in both my regular DVD and on my computer and its definitely a problem with the disc."
5,awesome,"The quality and content was awesome. I just love hearing Jan Hammer's dark soudntracks and seeing the spectacular renditions of my favorite episodes - without commercials.This could only be topped by having all of Jan Hammer's tunes played in succession. Many of his tunes have been released on various albums, but some of the good ones are missing."
3,Miami Vice Season 2,"If you are a Miami Vice Fan you will love it. the thing I don't like is the Two(2) sided disc. The discs seem thiner then usual but the movie quality is good. Compared to other sets that I have purchased in the past which contained heavier one sided picture discs, the Miami Vice box sets (1 & 2 anyway) seem of cheaper quality. Because of this I question the price on these items. As I said before in other box sets I have purchased of better quality materials, The price is in the same ball park. Alas I shall buy them because I do like the series."
1,Attention: DVD does not play on PC !!!,"Hi all:Please be warned: I ordered this product from the US all the way to Switzerland: only to end up sitting in front of my home theater in frustration agony!One of the the DVDs does not play on computer DVD-drives!!!Since I am using a PC based home theater (PC, Sanyo beamer, Onkyo Surround Receiver) I can not watch this DVD.There was no problem with the first season though."
4,Miami Vice season #2,"AHH! the 80's and Miami Vice good,good ,good times. This series defined the 80's generation. The music,clothing and the fast pace of life in general.Season #2 was grittier than season #1 and the good guys didn't always win but that didn't stop them from trying. Good story plots and great music."
5,The Style and The Fury - Season 2,One of the most amazing television shows in it's best season. That should be enough to explain why you need to own this now! Let others give you the episode by episode breakdown. Take it from someone who went out later on Fridays all the time this series was on - it looks way better now on the plasma!
2,Disappointment,"Appropriately, I started reading this in Mykonos last year. Now I'm on the Q train between Times Sq and 57th st. and just explode in laughter as I reached page 175 (for those of you who have read it - it is where you think you are reading a raunchy paperback from the checkout line at Duane Reade). I started to ask myself if maybe it was just me, or if this book was seriously written so poorly?I'll give it the benefit of (2) stars because of concept. It was very creative, original, whimsical (sic?), and cute. It fell short in the areas of supporting plot, writing style, and challenge.In summary, I felt like it was a first attempt of a book by an inexperienced writer. Great concept, had great potential, just fell short. It would have been a great children's book"
5,Mykonos & Greenwich Revisited!!!,"What joy to revisit these two wonderful places through agreat story and mythical fun! Having just been to Greece, I couldvisualize every nook and cranny in Mykonos! Anyone planning a trip to Mykonos (or Greenwich) should read this book! And anyone who has been there - you will love it! I've read it twice and will probably read it again! And I'll certainly tell all of our fellow travelers to purchase this book! The illustrations are fanciful and fun, too! Just read it! You won't be disappointed!"
5,Yum!,Tastes great for a low-fat snack. Robert's American Gourmet snacks are helping me develop a healthier taste for snack food. Way healthier than potato chips.
3,you get what you pay for,"If you have a tight budget, buy this book. If you are more concerned with accuracy, keep looking. The book is good but has many errors that make it hard to trust. With wrong answers listed as right in an answer key, it's difficult to have faith in the accuracy of your results. Sample test results are not numeric, also, which would allow a more meaningful practice run, in my opinion. I'm sure the actual scoring algorithms are likely difficult to replicate, but even just a rough guide like ""a score of FAIR on a section may translate into a 500-600 rough score estimate"" would be a big help for those of us with a goal score in mind. The book is well worth the price, but may be disappointing if you hoped to get it all in this package or are annoyed by errors."
2,It's cheap but too outdated,This book does not have current GMAT information. The test is now computer-based and its best advice to you in preparing is to remember to bring plenty of #2 pencils to the test site.
2,Cheap but flawed,"This books needs a good proofreading. There are lots of typographical errors and examples where the answer is an answer to a different question. Also, some of the answers in the critical reasoning and sentence correction are just plain wrong! In every set of questions i missed @2 that i believed i had the right answer; and i usually got only 80% right in this book, but when i take the sample tests in the official gmat book (straight from the gmat folks) i get 95% correct, so i think the problem is w/ the book and not me. this may not have anything to do w/ the problems in the book, but i noticed that the authors are israeli, so i'm skeptical they're to be relied on as the authoritative source on idiomatic English, just as i would be skeptical, in the absence of any other evidence, of any Americans who claimed to be the arbiter of idiomatic Hebrew.nonetheless, this book is good practice and small and portable, but don't take their answers as gospel."
4,El cuarto de Tula - Cucala - Quimbara - Sombras - La Murga,"Great Music... Performance is real good, with new arrangement and flavor. Powerfull singers and lots of dancing beats."
4,Shotgun,My just turned 6 year old is probably a bit too young for this gun but it works fine for pretend play although it is a bit heavy and hard to do the trigger. My hope is this toy will last a few years and when he's a bit older he will enjoy it's real benefits in the backyard.
1,awful big disappointment......,I donated to the public library......Reiki Hands of Light....not one of my favorites...hopefully someone else will get more from it!~.....Would not buy again!~
1,Music for,"If you like new age music, you might love this album,but if you just like music, it will bore you to tears."
2,picture is wrong,"This is not the product you get. When I spoke with the supplier they said they'd been unable to get Amazon to fix the photo. You get the current model which has 1 pen holder and a coin divot and 2 pockets. I really wanted this pictured version, but they gave me a full refund and told me to keep what I got. The pen hole is too tight for any of MY pens - it might hold a pencil. The back half of the top surface angles upwards and blocks my air vent so I took a bread knife to the cupholder and modified it. Not the prettiest solution but it works to hold my reading specs, etc. For my iPhone I use a ProClip car mount."
4,"Great unit, but lacks memo/record feature.","We love this unit! It sounds great, and it's easy to use. We love having the answering machine and Caller ID integrated with the cordless phone. And it will page me on my cell phone when somebody leaves a message. But one thing it lacks, which our old Panasonic unit had and which we miss, is the ability to hit a record button to record phone conversations. The same button on that unit would let us record memos to each other. I just wish this unit had that feature also."
2,I hate this phone,"I bought this phone for the two line capability, dss technology and built-in answering machine. I also liked the idea of having two keypads. The features are terrific but I hate the phone - the buttons don't seem to always respond - using many of the features is difficult (i'm always having to pull out the manual) and holding the phone on my shoulder often results in cutting off the caller. The keyboard on the base only works with the speakerphone-not exactly what I had in mind! So now I'm on the search for yet another phone with these feautes (minus the called ID which I don't use). Unfortunatley, I kept thinking I'd adjust to this phone and didn't return it promptly so now I think it's mine. I was recently at a client's home and noticed they had the same phone - I asked if they liked it and they said they hated it! So I guess I'm not the only one."
2,poor implementation of perfect set of features.,"Set of features is perfect, but what's most important for phone -- how it sounds. This phone distorts the sound, use of callerID is complicated (reverse side of the receiver), answering system, time setting are complicated and not user-friendly."
4,It's after shave,"It's after shave. I got it becasue it is fragrance free and does not irritate me post shave. If you have sensitive skin, it's a good product but if you have normal skin, any product will do. YMMV....NEOSOUL06"
2,Disappointed,"Not that good. For some reason and I guess this is my fault, I had the impression that George Michael was the artist, not whoever this was. My error, but I think it was deliberately vague and I didn't pay enough attention. Don't like the cover versions here, plus the jewel case was thrashed (broken)."
2,Question,PLEASE tell us if a DVD has closed caption !!!No one does this and I cannot buy a DVD without it.Please tell the AMAZON people to put CC on the ones with closedcaption. Many of us have trouble hearing and we really need it.I would be buying A LOT OF DVs and tapes if I could find CC onthe writeup.
3,My Family and Other Animals.,"The movie is not nearly as good as the book which is totally hilarious. Gerald Durrel is a famous naturalist and his book mostly contains his adventures as a child in Crete and the animals and people he discovered there. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't do that and consentrates mainly on his family's excentricities and even misses some of the funniest family incidents while concentrating on the adventures of his pretty sister in what I suppose they considered ""the love interest"","
5,Fun With Animals,What a romp. For apperantly no sane reason a British Family moves to Geece just before World War II. The rather isolated and run down home they move into is obviously an invitation to disaster. While the Older sister is bringing home strange boy friends and an older brother is going crazy with guns the young boy in the family starts collecting live animals which drive everybody to distraction. He loves the animals more I think than his sister loves her gentleman friends. Then suddenly the War breaks out and Greece is no longer safe. They have to go back to England where the boy grows up to be a World famouse Animal scientist.
3,My Famikly,"An 'innocent' but informed view of the world (as seen through a young boy's eyes). Nature lovers and budding scientists will identify with it immediately. Some mild humour and quite excellent acting from the 'young Gerald Durrell.' If you are into family relationships, the vacation atmosphere and like something that does not drag you down for the next 24 hours with its constant catharsis, then see this."
1,Poorly written and unworthy of further consideration,"If you're looking for a one-dimensional, ethno-centric, skewed rambling that attempts but fails to comment on the social dynamics of the American society, this is probably the book for you. The book is difficult to read due to the author's inability to effectively communicate his perception of reality. I started reading this book because it promised to let me peer at life through a new lens, but it was just the typical mediocre garbage, self-righteously forced on the reader through unpersuasive writing. I managed to read the entire book, which was like watching a slow-motion train wreck (VERY slow-motion), but I now regret doing so as I have lost that time forever---time that could have been spent with family, or actually expanding my horizons.In short, I do not recommend reading this book."
2,Cool Ruler Gone Cold,"I was really excited to open up this DVD, crank up the volume, and skank along with the one and only Gregory Isaacs. Unfortunately I was disappointed from the outset. The video quality is quite poor (along with camera-work and editing) and Gregory himself was a sad sight. A once handsome, confident, strapping figure, he is now reduced to a grey-haired, pot-bellied, teetering old shell of himself. What's equally disappointing is the obvious weakness of his once strong, silky voice. In fact, his songs often sound best when he turns his mike to the audience (which he does constantly throughout the show). Gregory has been such a wonderful part of the reggae world that it's heartbreaking to see what he's become. On the positive side, the song selection is excellent and the 5.1 audio really sounds great. If your a huge Isaacs fan you may want to fork over the cash to get this disc, otherwise take that same money and purchase one of his many, many classic cds."
5,Killashandra,I recommend any book written by Anne McCaffrey. She is a marvelous writer. Her books will hold your attention form start to finish.
3,An enjoyable read,This was a very enjoyable read. This is one of Anne's last good books. I recommend it.
1,Is someone checking the quality of the eebooks before selling therm ?,I bought this paper book quite a few years ago and enjoyed it. The lousy quality of the kindle edition makes it a real pain to read it in this form. Are you guys proofing the kindle editions before putting them on sale ?
3,Poweruser,"I consider myself a Poweruser and I've been using Symbian devices for a long time (ever since Psion3). Now, I currently use a P800 and I actually had the P910 for a week before I decided to return it. The phone is good but it didn't give me any compelling reasons to keep it since:a) no EDGE!b) no BlackBerry support (at least the US version doesn't have it)c) bulky design (my P800 is actually a much better design)in other words, I didn't see much of a difference to my existing P800. Having said that, I'm still waiting for a long-long overdue upgrade from SonyEricsson in this product category.I could maybe recommend the Nokia 9300 as alternative (at least I'm thinking about it - not just because it looks so much like my beloved Psion 3)"
1,Poorly formatted; look for a better copy,"This text is a miserably formatted book- the text is mashed together with no semblance of line breaks.There are several better (and less expensive!) versions from Halcyon Classics, MobileReference, etc.One of Amazon's two free versions (as of this writing) has proper line breaks albeit with annoyingly wide left margin, but is still far superior to this rendering.I'm leaving this review simply as a buyer-beware."
3,Typical universal fit quality,This product is typical of a universal fit product. It works but that is about all you can say for it. I would rather spend a little more if I could get a more custom fit product.
4,This is great,I like it alot but I am having issues with one window not going down all the way I have to put light pressure on it to make it go down but my installer is trying to address this issue and I am sure it will be resolved.The other window works well and it is so nice to gust exit the car and set the alarm and the windows all roll up.
5,Illuminating and Revealing,"I've been following Minerva Bloom's works since she first started posting her poetry at Themestream (an online gathering of poets, long while ago). Her voice has matured, and it is remarkably her own. It has been fascinating to see her transform. Not only in outer beauty but particularly in inner beauty. Specially because she writes in her second language: English. Most respectfully, a big fan."
2,There's A Reason Why It's Out-Of-Print,"The bottom line on this book is that there is very little discussion of Jesus or Judaism. On the other hand, there is much bragging about the Jewish contribution to American arts, politics and sciences. Furthermore, the book is awfully dated, Yaseen cites too many Jewish pop-cultural figures from the late 60's to the late 70's (e.g. Linda Lavin, Bonnie Franklin, Jill St. John) to prove his point."
4,"Great Boombox, Reasonably Priced!",I bought this item about a month ago. I have been very pleased with it. It has good sound and I have not experienced the noise that some other reviewers have written about. My only complaint is that the radio is difficult to remove from the slot and takes some effort. I liked this enough that we replaced our old (CD quit working) shelf stereo system with this. I actually have two - one for work and one for home.
3,"Delphi Audio system is nice to look at, very noisy.","We recently purchased the Delphi Sa 10034 Skyfi Cd audio system. All of the features are great. The problem I have, is with the cd player.When you play a cd, there is a very loud hum that is evident even with music playing. You have to turn the music up loud, to drown out the hum. This is not a defective unit, since this is a known issue with most all units. I did read the reviews of others who had the same problem. I just hoped they were exagerating this. They were not and I will just live with the annoyance. Over all, the unit is nicely designed and well built, with the exception of the cd playing noise."
3,What is that noise?!?,"This is a nice little all-inclusive stereo since it plays my XM, CD's, AM/FM, and MP3's ... BUT ... at low volumes, you can hear this low-pitched vibrating/motor sound in the background that is very annoying! So it works great if you want your music loud, but if you want to have it low (as background music when you have people over, etc), skip past this one. The motor noise will drive you and your guests nuts!"
4,XM SKYFi Radio Review,"Bought this for my Dad for Father's Day ... didn't ship to me until I had to contact the company and then they rush delivered it to my house because someone obviously messed up the order. Not too happy with the shipping procedures at Amazon.com/Etronics. Product is of good quality, though."
4,Great application of various modes of music delivery,"My only complaint, albeit a small one, would be to have the speakers disengage from the unit for a stero effect."
1,"Love it, or Hate it","Loved it, the first day. Hated it ever since. Right out of the box, it worked like a champ, sounded good, used my wife's skyfi2 in it, no problems. Used the skyfi2 receiver it came with in the car the next day, again, no problems with the XM receiver, but the boombox is dead. If you turn the volume UP ALL THE WAY, you get a little pop and crackle, thats it. sounds like the internal amps are blown. It does this with CD/FM/XM. Returned it to place of purchase, I've been waitting two weeks for a replacement to come in. During that time, I'm reading reviews and understanding why its taking so long. It does appear to be a MAJOR problem that Delphi should own up to. I'm not the only one with sound problems."
3,"I have two of these - one good, one bad","I purchased one of these, and I love it. My wife loves it too, and she stole it for the kitchen. The sound is just fine.So, I purchased another one just like it. Out of the box, the second one has a whistle on XM and the obnoxious ""motorboat"" hum described in some of these other reviews. Unbearable! I'm returning it, and I'm hoping I get one from the ""good"" batch like my first one.It appears that if you purchase one of these, you're rolling the dice."
2,Starting to go after two years..............,"I never had a problem with this radio until today. It has been exactly two years since I bought the delphi boom box. My display unit on the CD part of the boom box has gone kaput. The radio still works, but I cannot see what radio station I have on and I cannot see the song number on the CDs. I called delphi tech support and was told that since I am passed my one-year warranty, I am out of luck. They can do nothing for me. They told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about $80 an hour. I can probably live without the display unit, but I hope this doesn't mean that more things with this radio will start to go wrong. Be prepared to possibly have to upgrade after two years with this one."
4,Handy little music box,"I really like this boombox. I mainly use it to listen to XM radio but I like the fact that I can play a CD (rarely) or listen to AM/FM radio (occasionally). Not the highest fidelity in the world but it is great for around the house, backyard BBQ-ing, working in the yard, the beach..."
1,Poor quality & customer service,"We bought this Saturday, installed easily, good sound. After a couple days I tried using the portable feature by installing batteries. Never got it to work despite using several sets of batteries. Now it won't work when I connect it back to electricity, just get a loud hum. Customer service is voice mail or email, never got a response. We are returning this for a refund after only four days."
1,Awful noise problem.,"The portable CD Audio boombox works perfect with am/fm/cd/mp3 but with the SkiFi2 radio there is an awful fluttering sound at low sound volume. (Like a distant helicopter) I returned the unit twice to be replaced. The new units had the same problem. Then I borrowed the demo unit from the store, took it home and, it worked very well.So go figure this out? Apparently this technical problem is well known to Delphi. Why they have not recalled and refurbished these units is a mystery. They say the output from the SkiFi2 radio is a little too powerful for the sound board in the CD Audio Boombox. I am no audiophile, but I like the concept. Hopefully I can locate a newer unit that does not have this problem with the SkiFi2"
5,Delphi SKYFI CD Audio Boombox,There's not much to say about this item except it's the BOMB!It has exceeded my expectations. I am very happy I bought this product. It's much better then the regular SKYFI boombox without the AM-FM radio and CD player.
1,Nepotistic reviews? I think not.,"Pardon this ""meta-review,"" but I feel that the review of Oshinky by Oshinsky (of course, a ""completely unbiased"" Oshinsky) is a farce. I have not read the book, but several of my colleagues have, and all of them praise its merits. This is not the point of my ""REVIEW"" - my point is, obviously nepotistic ""reviews"" are as credible as self-referential, author-written ""reviews."" If you really think that this book should win the Nobel Prize, as well as the Pulitzer, the Tony, the Emmy, the Oscar, et al., then at least use a pseudonym, so that we can take your opinions a little more seriously"
3,Borderline Yellow Journalism,"Just to leave absolutely no mystery as to my opinion of this book, I hated reading it. The facts would be very interesting if the author hadn't turned it into sensationalist garbage. Oshinsky did some good research and gives details about many events that *should* be written and read about, however, his snarky tone throughout the entire piece absolutely made my skin crawl. I would almost rather do all of my own research about this subject than suffer through his painfully biased whining, but I was forced to read this for a history course. In short, if you must read this, do it from an aloof and detached perspective - or you'll just want to murder the author."
4,Classic Serkin,"The LP of Serkin playing this same concerto was the first classical record I bought, back in 1966 or so. I loved his playing then, and love it now. These two recordings of the Emperor are bookends of his career more or less. Serkin was a great artist, but was also a hummer, which is distracting to some people (it doesn't bother me).The recording engineering is excellent and the sound has a great presence. I've always like Telarc's engineering, and think the engineers' names should be on the labels of all CDs so we can follow them and pick out the ones we like. Failing that, we go with the label name, which, as I say, I consider good in the case of Telarc.My only gripe is that the adagio is not quite as sweet as I've heard by some other artists and even by Serkin himself in the earlier LP recording. But this recording is well worth the money, and, if the Emperor is one of your favorites, I think you should add this one to your collection."
1,This CD is kind of WHACK!!,I only like a couple of song on this album.It's probably cuz I don't like all those different types of music.But I'm gonna keep it real most of the songs it sounds like he has a machine for his voice. But I have to him some props because he can sing in different styles.
1,Tonex 02,"I was very disappointed with this cd. It was a waste of money. I have heard a few of his songs in the past and the most popular song from this cd.""God has not forgot"" It is a little too techno for me it takes away from what is being said i will be trading this cd."
5,AWESOME!,"What can I say! God has used Tonex again to be a blessing to His people!I thought the first CD was something else, but this one is fantastic! Listening to ""Beautiful Place"" makes you want to be raptured up that very moment! Tonex is definitely a keeper!"
5,Track 14 is going to be my wedding song!!!!!!!!,THis is a very good follow-up to Pronounced Toe-nay. The long wait between albums was worth the wait. More good music and good anointed substance.
2,"Unless you ARE Oliver Reed, you don't care this much about Oliver Reed","Were this book 150 pages in length, then maybe. But it's not. After about a third of the book, I decided I didn't care that much about this guy's life, and the author didn't change my mind about that."
5,"May be inexpensive, but well worth the money!!!","I have a 46 inch Akai DLP HDTV and I love it. The only time I have ever heard the fan running is when you are turning on or off the TV - by no means does it run 24/7 and if it does, I sure don't hear it! It has a very crisp and clear picture while watching DVD's and HD Television.Once you have watched one of these pure HD channels you will never want to watch the regular channels again.Several of my friends own Akai's as well and I have never heard anyone complain to be honest I ran down a got mine because of the great success they have had with theirs.My opionion is that this TV is well worth the money you won't be sorry!"
2,Cheap and for a reason!,"If you are looking for a cheap entry level HD TV then this might be for you, but there are problems.1)Like the picture is terrible if you do not have high definition input (expect that computer interpolated funny picture you get form most HD TV with analog input). NOT FOR THOSE WHO STILL USE analog (cable like)input.2) I could never get the picture to look just right with adjustments. Once one thing looked good, then other thing looked terrible.3) Exceptionally noisy TV! I've since learned some newer DLP TV's are better but this one is bad. You'll hear the fan run 24/7.4) Did not keep a 4:3 picture ratio when I turn off the TV? An adjustment you will have to make.Probably a decent TV if you have HD broadcast with the correct inputs.The cheapest you can expect to pay for a good 42-46"" DLP (Samsung, Toshiba, etc..) TV as of today is about $1500-1700. Any thing less is most likely 1st generation DLP's and using old technology."
2,Viva Chuck Vincent,Well anyone expecting the Citizen's Kane of Cheerleader films from this will be disappointed.I love a good low brow cheerleader movie you should see my collection but Cheerleader Beach Party is a bit lacking. Even by B movie standards( if there is such a thing) this is poorly shot Chuck Vincent who was behind this film was a well known porn director of the 70's and 80's.And having seen a few of his X rated films I think that the production values on them beats Cheerleader Beach party hands down.Plus the 4 female leads playing the cheerleaders are not that good looking.Heck Vincent cast his porno actress in his other T & A films and should have here as well.Trust me I won't go into the plot or acting as you can imagine them yourself and most likely be correct. Overall Beach Party is worth a look but it's really not worth going out of your way for.
1,bottom of the barrel,"you don't expect anything that would rival 'Titanic' when you watch a film like this, but there are some givens, sexy looking women, the ones in this film are all skinny, some funny lines, none exist, but the production quality is bad, I don't know iof the original was shot so darkly or it is just a cheap transfer but the entire film looks like they avoided filming in sunshine. if you are a cheerleader film completist, then waste the 80 minutes of your life on this one, otherwise get Jack Hill's Swinging Cheerleaders, it isn't mentailly stimulating, but the plot is much better and the actresses are good looking"
3,It's OK,"I bought this album for Enamorame. It's a good song, upbeat merengue with a hip-hop influence. Kind of what you could expect from a group like Fulanito.The rest of the CD is kind of lame. If you can find Enamorame on a single, I suggest buying that instead of the entire CD."
2,Smaller than expected,This thing is tiny- too small to cover my 10 inch frying pan. Guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. Into the trash it goes.
3,It's a lid alright,It serves its purpose but don't expect much in the way of sturdiness and durability. You might want to consider spending a little more on a more substantial universal lid.
2,Better than nothing,This lid is flimsy but better than nothing. It also doesn't sit adequately on the pot if you have handles on your pot.
4,Great product!,"Great for those lidless pots. It fits any pots up to 10"". Only drawback is that it doesn't fit my largest frying pan which is 12"""
2,"Super flimsy, not very good quality","When I received the package, it was already bent up, probably because it isn't made very well. The metal is thin and if you throw it around too much it'll definitely bend. I suppose it's good for your most basic needs, but other than that, don't be afraid to dish out a little extra to get a better lid."
3,Flimsy but works,"I ordered two, and both came pre-dented. LOL Anyway, the lid is aluminum, so I expected it to be on the flimsy side. Although I think $5 would be a better price than the price I paid for. In any case, it gets the job done. I have a couple of 8"" pan and a few 6"" pots, and this lid works nicely with all of them. They're surprisingly easy to clean too; different than the aluminum I'm familiar with."
2,Cheesey,"Sad that a made in USA item is so flimsy. Was delivered with minor dents and discolored when used to cover a frying pan containing sliced potatoes. Prior review that mentions not good for covering 12"" pans is misleading. It barely covers a 10 1/4 (#8) Griswold CI frying pan."
4,Very useful!,"This is a must-have for users of many skillets that lack lids (or for those who do not want to clutter up the kitchen with tons of glass lids). I agree with the reviewer who said it is flimsy (which is why I gave it four stars instead of five); mine had a teeny, tiny dent in it, but really no biggie. Not as good quality as the old one I have, but useful nonetheless, as I need one for home and one for the camper."
3,large cover?,"Was looking for a large cover for all my pots, thought this one would do it, not so. I use it for small pots still looking for a larger one...received the item very quickly....would not order this again."
2,Ok but far from ideal,"As others have mentioned, it's made of aluminum - and very big on small pots and pans. Still it meets the basic need."
3,Mamma Mamma!,"I saw the cover art of this book - leering ant men, claws raised - and knew that this was classic pulp. After reading this I'm surprised. This was a fairly dense read, with a good deal of descriptive detail. The plotline is something that was used years later by Land of The Lost - a team of explorers in the Australian Outback are beset by an earthquake and electrical storm, plummeting into a prehistoric world inhabited by human sized intelligent ants. The ending is fairly abrupt, but this was a nice slice of '50s sci-fi.My message title is in tribute to the grizzled character of Nugget, whose favorite exclamation is ""Mamma, Mamma"", a phrase repeated on almost every other page."
3,A very good video to practice t'ai chi chih.,"While there are minor technical flaws, the camera cuts out a part of a movement once or twice and the repetition is only six times (while the recommended practice is nine times), it is a nicely done video of t'ai chi chih and easy to follow. Music and scenery nice too."
4,very practical and reliable,"I've been looking for a small size weather radio am/fm with hard to find headphone jack and found this at amazon...btw amazon is a one stop shop....I've been using this in the office for my morning radio and information and its just great...sounds great too. Just notify you that battery was not included in your purchase, its the back up for clock in case of power failure. Try this mid-small radio, i cant say its too small nor too big...just right for me"
2,Nice holster-Doesn't fit Smith and Wesson 686 7-shot,It's too bad because this holster is pretty nice. The thumb strap doesn't go around the hammer of my S&W .357 7-shot. In the description it says it does but it doesn't. Seems like a good holster though.
1,Bigen causes severe allergic swelling,I got this for my mom to color her hair. Her head and arms swelled up massively after using just a little of it. I thought this would be gentle natural alternative to ammonia/peroxide based hair color products. Beware taking this!!!
3,Permanent dye?,"I tried the semi dye, color only lasted 2 weeks. So is this a permanent dye? How long does it last?"
3,Bigen Powder Hair Color - Natural Brown #58 is a misnomer,"Unfortunately, as I suspected, the description of this product- Natural Brown #58 - is a misnomer. In English, no such creature; #58 is Black- Brown which I assume to be rather dark and did not want to order. But, what the heck, eventually it washes out. Haven't used it yet but we'll see how it does. To lessen confusion, I suggest Amazon eliminate this name."
1,Bigen Has PPD!,I remember Bigen from what my parents used in the 80's. My mom found that she was hyperallergic to the substance used in Bigen & switched to other hair dyes - made her break out into rashes & had massive hair fall. Use at your own risk!
4,easy hair color with no chemical ick,"I have used Aveda color for years and wanted to try something that was gentle and easy. I like the product a lot. The value is amazing and it is very easy to use at home. There is no stinging or chemical smell and all you need is water, a coloring dish and brush. I have gray roots and this product covered them well. My hair looks healthy and shiny and the using a lighter color than I thought I needed was the right choice. I would recommend this product to anyone who regularly colors their hair and wants a good home alternative that is gentle and less toxic than other home hair color."
4,The Parts for advanced astrologers,"This is NOT a good book if you're looking for a quick reference and interpretation of the parts that you see listed everywhere. You will have to know almost all of your astrological terms to figure out the formulas, because there isn't a table listing Bonatti's parts. But if you are an advanced astrologer, this book lists and describes some very interesting parts that can still be used in natal and horary astrology. A description of how to take the formula as well as definitions for the following parts are included: The parts of the 7 planets, parts of the 12 houses (each house has more than 1 part associated with it) and also other parts such as parts pertaining to crops and other things. Again, if you're advanced, this is a good book to have it your collection of reference material."
2,VERY LITTLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION dealing with prediction,"It is obvious that the author spent a lot of time and effort in writing this book. It is about 245 pages long but the fonts are small so the book would be much thicker if it were printed in regular sized fonts. This book has two shortcomings listed below:1. No information to create the Arabic Astrology Charts! So this is not the book for the beginners2. Part III of the books from page 139 through page 224 is titled "" Practical Illustrations"". But only two out of five sample readings in it has some practical use, in my opinion. They are the interpretations for a prostitue and Watergate incident. I am skeptical when astrolgy tries to predict a country's or the world's events.In short, there is a lot of theoretical information but VERY LITTLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION dealing with prediction. You'll need another book to go with this one."
2,I was not pelased with the sound quality,"While the features in this phone really grabbed my attention, I never realized how lousy analog phones sound. I have a 900mhz Sony cordless phone and I never really thought about whether it was digital or analog. I found out the phone I already have is digital.There are no special feautres on my phone, other than memory dialing. And I would just as soon keep the phone I already have and return the Toshiba."
5,An Incredible Performance,"If any recording does justice to this remarkable work, this is it. Ormandy's performance combines great clarity with passion and feeling. This is especially true in the second movement, so stunningly beautiful in places that everything else momentarily vanishes. The last movement is also spectacular, a truly epic ending.The problems posed by balancing an organ with a symphony orchestra are handled well, and the quality of recording is very good.Even if you don't like Saint-Saens, buy this recording simply for the second movement. I guarantee it will become one of your favourite records."
4,Great recording,"Great recording of a powerful piece. The organ is clearly a wonderful pipe organ, with all the registers audible. In other recordings however, the piano is more easily heard. In this one, the piano is lost in the rest of the sound."
3,"So, so.","I'll start right off by saying that my expectations for this CD were very high as the first time I heard the piece was live in concert.Nothing compares to a live performance of this piece, however, for a studio recording this one isn't bad.There are only two tracks, which is strange since I have mostly heard this piece broken up into three movements.The sound quality is fine, but again, I am having a hard time giving this a great review since I have something much greater to compare it to.I also have a youtube recording of a live performance that I listen to that trumps this as well. Unfortunately, the orchestra that performed it do not offer a recording of that performance."
4,A good album with a great deal,"Open Road shows Cowboy Junkies at their best whether on CD or DVD. Not their absolute best concerts appearences (Long Journey Home, again a combo CD and DVD of them in concert, is I think better) but no CJ fan will be disappointed by Margo, Michael and the rest of the Junkies in performance. The performances are from their tour promoting their ""Open"" album. The DVD in addition to Cowboy Junkies in concert has lots of extras including interviews with the band members and an acoustic performance with Mike and Margo Timmin. No fan of the group will be disappointed by this 2 disc set."
1,THIS PHONE NEEDS WORK!,For this style phone I have to say that I have gone through 4 of them.. Thank god for warranities.. In under 2 years.. The major problem with them is with normal wear and tear the plastic headset gives easly and breaks... Same place on all phones and all break in under 6 months.. When asked if there was a recall Londondrugs simply said no it was to expensive.. and just replaced the phone.
4,"Great sound, cheap plastic on part of headset","Great phone....actually have had this specific model for 5years and also have same model with built in Call waiting/caller ID (which has way better features)...sound quality and reception distance from phone is EXCELLENT; however;plastic headsets on both of my phones have ""cracked"" (and are now taped together) right at the slide adjustment...they just cracked from use within first 6months of use on both...Need to currently buy another new unit with the caller ID feature and acn't seem to find them anywhere...Great phone overall/great value..."
3,Standard Gandt fare,"This novel got off to an extremely slow start. Chapters of boring nothingness. I found it to be styandard fare from Gandt, predictable outcomes if you have the patience."
3,Unfortunatly Unreal,"Personal wars are rarely if ever fought in jets. Nor do the ""Good Guys"" find their friends in the Middle East enviroment very often."
4,A nice surprise,"For his fifth novel with Brick Maxwell, Gandt moves into the Middle East, the war on terror, and Israeli-Palestinian politics. Some techno-thriller authors are starting to drag with their fifth novel. Not so with Gandt. Not overwhelmingly technical and includes some human interest, relationship twists. Plus, at the end of the book, the promise of more to come. Better than I expected!"
1,No good,"I bought a pack of 3 as it was much cheaper than buying individually. There were sites which called it one of the best leave in cream, but unfortunately it did no good for me. I have used livon and loreal serum before and they were so much better than this product. I'd not waste money on this again"
4,Good for Natural Kinky Curls,"I bought this product to help my dry hair retain moisture after my wash. So far so good(1) Product is water based so you'll get a creamy (not so thick) element(2) My 4C hair type reacted instantly, making it easier to finger detangle (my hair tends to tangle even though i dry detangle and wet detangle so this product helped).(3) No need to use large amounts ( I use a fair amount that is about the size of two quarters in my neck length hair)(4)This product was recommended to me in ""The science of Black Hair""- I also noticed a softer texture.Cons(1) My sister tried it in her relaxed hair and was not pleased.(2) Smell is not bad but nothing great eitherP.S-bottle looks like it will last me about 2 months- this product does not leave any visible residue in the hair"
1,Hate it,I heard so much about this product that i would give it a try and after usein git for a month it doesnt do anything better for my hair at all . all it does is sit on top of my hair and it doesnt even moistureize it good either. this was a waste of money for me
3,Not what i expected,"I have curly, frizzy hair and I thought this product would make my hair soft and take away the frizz. It does make my hair soft and easy to comb but does nothing for the frizz."
1,No use,I'm on my hair journey and trying to find a leave in which keeps my hair moist when blow dried with very low heat. This (in small quantities) has done nothing for me. I don't find it good.
3,Its OK,"The Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave In Cream does not make my hair silky. My hair only take to it sometimes.The days I wash my hair, the leave in cream makes my hair frizzy and dry. If I use it any other time my hair is fine, but its no better than any other leave in."
2,Would not use this stuff for the life of me.,When I bought this product I was beyond skeptical. I didn't believe it. However it does work and it works like they say. Odor is decreased in both waste and general. Yeah it works. But what's the price on health.I was leery about continued use due to the fact that I could not find enough research of alleviate my concerns about health. Then my little ferrets seemed to start having intestinal problems. They all seemed to have problems with cramping and stomach pain. I stopped use when my littlest started having problems walking with the arch to her back. Almost immediately the smell came back and the pain went away. I don't want to think about what else this stuff can to a ferret. I wouldn't use it and I don't.
4,Swinging but somewhat bland,"Not entering the discussion of Peggy Lee's singing, I must say this CD is somewhat bland.Bryson really sounds more like a good pop singer with a jazzy hinges than like a full fledged jazz singer... That would not be such a big problem generally speaking if most of the arrangements weren's quite jazzed up...Supporting cast is excellent, particularly tenor sax of Red Holloway and the clarinet guest spot for Paquito D'Rivera; without them three stars would be quite enough for this album. This way, it's quite an enoyable listening experience, but far from essential or brilliant."
3,Pass on Bryson and pick up a Lee CD,"Bryson performs some favorite Lee hits, especially her latter day SOME CATS KNOW, but her imitation of Lee's smoldering sensuality falls short and all her songs start to sound the same."
5,A spot of Good Old America,"I felt a great sense of lyrics and poetry in this CD you rarely experience today. I liked best The Main Trial, in which I felt stronger an ancient religious spirit, simple and pure. This is the first time I listen to a Blue Sky Boys album, but I couldn't help to be very involved in their music so arcaic and essential. It touches the strings of your heart and makes them vibrate deeply, bringing you to the Good Old America of the good feelings. Please forgive me for my poor English, and I hope to make understand my sensations."
1,save a tree,This 'utopian' one world socialist contract idea will find its way out the hind-end from where it was conceived. It is because of these socialist do-gooders that millions survive when they should be plant food. The only reason this irrational altruism has survived this long is because you will not allow kids to be taught to think..... to make up their own minds on what is real. People have lost the ability to use their minds..... the only way this parasite can survive is by government supported protection by gun-point ... it could never survive on its own merits....and won't
5,Great Book!,"I love this book! I have not read the new encyclopedia, but I do know that this is full of great information. If you are looking for a larger collection of data, you should probably look at the new encyclopedia (I am only guessing-I don't know how good the new one is yet.) but if you are looking for a smaller collection of information this book is for you! Because this was published near the end of the 1990's, it has no information on the prequels, but a lot about the original movies, television shows and specials, and books published before thst time. I enjoy this book."
4,"Excellent *THEN*, Not so hot now....","This was an excellent book when it came out, and just glancing at the other reviews gives you an idea of what the good qualities are- and there are many.But since then, the prequels have been added to the Star Wars world, the entire NJO series of books has come out, and how many other sources?If you're looking for a starting place to work on your SW knowledge, this is a great way to go.If you're looking for a handy reference to everything Star Wars that is as up to date as it can be, well... This book is from 1998. That's *six* years ago.If this book were to be updated, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. It was excellent when it was new and I had no complaints. Until then, I'll just stick with a borrowed copy for those rare occasions when outdated info might help."
5,avery good book,"This book was a quality piece of work. It held my interest for hours on end. I recomend it to everyone, from the Star Wars fanatic to the Star Wars illiterate."
5,A Great Book,"This is THE source for star wars. It has everything that has to do with star wars up to the most recent books(excluding I, Jedi). I ordered mine from this website and was very pleased with the service. It costs less than a bookstore and comes packaged very well. The only thing I noticed about the book was a few mistakes, such as showing Ephant Mon's picture next to Hermi Odle's entry."
4,An excellent resource book with only a few errors.,Maybe an update will be released soon. To those who didn't like this book because of the cover. That art was originally seen on the Revenge of the Jedi poster for the movie Return of the Jedi. It was a good cover anyway
3,Could've been better,"I'll keep it short: this one could've been better. The descriptions of the topics are good, but a lot of the pictures just ruin the credibility of the subjects. There are simply too many cartoonish pictures in it. The credibility in Star Wars lies in the fact that everything looks used and the technology is made believable. And a lot of pictures in this book spoil it. If you compare it to, do I dare to say it, the Star Trek encyclopedia, the latter wins hands down. I have to admit it has far more photographic reference material, but the overall feel of that book is more believable (trust me, I'm not a Star Trek fan). If you look at the ""Essential Guide"" series, it's clear that it can be done with drawings instead of pictures. It's just a pity they didn't try any harder with the encyclopedia."
4,It was really good,"It was very good! I found it to be very informative. It covered almost everything from the largest to the smallest detail. However, it left off a little information."
5,star wars encyclopedia,i found the content great especially for it being the original trilogy and comic books as well as the mini movies. it was also suprising that it was current up to the modified episodes of 4-6.
4,Good for the hardcore Star Wars fan,"First off this isnt a new edition of the Star Wars ""Guide To"" books. This is a very large scale, all-encompassing, up-to-date reference volume.If you already have the ""Guide To"" books, Id question wether its worth you rushing out to buy this book. Its the kind of book that is really handy if you are just getting into the ""rest"" of the Star Wars universe, outside of the movies, and are a bit confused with characters, places or events that have happened elsewhere and in other times in SW history.If you are a light-hearted SW movie fan and dont dabble in the SW books, comics and various other spin-offs, dont bother, get the ""Guide To""s or the ""Essential Guide To""s instead."
1,What a shame I paid $50 for this,"Normally Steve Sansweet's work is pretty damn good. This is not the norm. This book is a mass of contradictions. Nobody seems to have checked some of the info in here. He has people credited as living after they've been killed off, ships that have been destroyed listed as intact, and some just plain wrong facts. Great pictures, but it wasn't worth the money. If he wanted to do it right, wait, pick the books you want to put in there, then finish the book. He didn't. There's a whole lot of Black Fleet Crisis material missing when it's listed in the biblio. Also there's a lot of times when he cuts corners on entries. I hope if they do another, it's alot better."
2,Star Wars Encyclopedia,"I was very disappointed with the condition of my purchase. I felt that the seller misled the buyer (myself). They rated the book in great condition, almost new. Excellent I believe may be the description they used. Well, far from excellent, not even good condition. The jacket of the book has water damaged to the point it stained the back cover of the book under the jacket. The binding is loose, cover almost torn from the inerds of the book. I'm giving this as a gift and didn't want to hassle returning it, but I will never buy from that particular seller again if I am aware of the exact seller being the same one. Like I said, the back jacket is misshapened and wrinked from water damage and should not have been rated the way it was. I'm truly disappointed. First time not satisfied by the way, usually always satisfied with my Amazon purchases, only this one. Tricia W."
5,Great little device - Love it!,"Thanks to this little device, I am now able to print wirelessly using my new print server. The setup was as easy as 1-2-3. Following the instructions that came with the print server, I had everything up and running in a very short period of time. Now I don't have to ""pug"" and ""unpug"" the printer usb cable into my laptop in order to print. Also, I've saved the money that I would have spent in buying a wireless printer. Thank you."
3,Works with some printers,"This version works with my Canon PIXMA iP6000D printer, but will not wake it up if it is in powersave mode. The setup went much better than my old NetGear print server, so I bought another one (the TE100-P1U - newer model) for my HP LaserJet 1020. Alas, these print servers do not support the HP LJ 1020. And you cannot find that out on TrendNet's website; you have to call their Tech Support to see if your printer is supported. The server itself is 4 stars; the support is 2 stars."
2,BE CAREFUL!,"Be very careful with this server. There are many printers that will not work with it; I happen to have two. It is very difficult to set up and to trouble shoot. I've spent 2 hours on the phone with Tech support only to have them tell me that my new HP Laser P1006 will not work with this device. I also tried to install it with a Lexmark Z645; it will not support that printer either! Trendnet does not seem to have an ""approved printers"" list either, so who knows!"
2,Does not work with all USB printers.,"After reading the description which said it worked with most UBS printers, I bought this. The problem is there was no list of what its not compatible with. I was able to install this server on my network in minutes. The problem was my printer was one of the ones which was not compatible. My Lexmark 5400 is a multi-function printer/fax/scanner/copier. After trying to get the printer working for hours I called TRENDnet customer service. The tech was friendly and ran through the setup again in minutes. When that did not work she checked and found out my printer was not compatible. She gave me a phone number to call to check compatibility for their products. I think that list should be given in the item description (web link maybe) before I wasted my time ordering this."
1,Read the title of the review first!,"Amazon screwed up - the reviews here are mostly for other types of print servers; not the TE100-P1U. This print server worked great for two pcs running WinXP, but it does NOT work on Win 7 because the server Amazon sent me is the older hardware version A1. None of the downloadable files at the Trendnet website are new enough to include Win 7. If you read more reviews here, be sure the reviews are for the correct model!"
2,Didn't work with my printer,I had to return this item because when I called Tech Support they told me the printer wasn't compatible with this unit. It would have been nice to know that BEFORE I bought it.
1,"piece of junk, barely adequate macintosh support","I wasted a lot of time on this piece of junk and returned it the day after I bought it. Maybe the windows support is ok but the Macintosh support is _barely_ adequate. The manual is vapor so expect to do a lot of searches on their terrible homepage. I had to infer configuration information from other models to get it to work. It never detected the printer right, half of the options on the damn internal web config I could not find documentation for, the Bonjour/Rendezvous printing never worked, IPP didn't work, and although the product description says it supports these, the FAQ answer I found on the website says to use lpr/lpd. After a couple of hours and a very bad taste in my mouth, I returned it and got an Airport Express for $99. Worked within 5 minutes of plugging it in. Detected the right printer and driver and just works. Oh, and the Airport Express is a wireless router as well."
1,Extremely poor choice,"Connecting the server was easy. Installation of the utility software no sweat, too. Although, when it came to setup, the server control panel repeatedly asked for a password. Since I didn't set one, it must have been set by factory. Calling the Tech Support did not resolve the matter. Returning to the seller."
5,Excellent Print Server,"This is an excellent item. Setup was extremely simple and quick. I have a HP Designjet 500 and a HP 1500 all in one connected to it and everything works perfectly. I would reccommend this to anyone.There is a wired and wireless version, I already had my wireless home network setup so I just bought the wired version and connected it, works great."
1,Not Compatible with Macintosh,I spent several hours messing with this print server - what a waste. I never successfully set it up to work with my iMac even though the user manual described it as compatible with the Mac.... what a waste of time and energy. It's going back.
1,What a Piece of Junk!!!!,"I configured the DNS, IP and even tried to let it do it's own thing AUTOMATICALLY and still nothing. I read reviews about how hard this thing was to configure and how some were in the same boat as me and had absolutely NO LUCK and gave up. I even re-loaded the software about a dozen times and still nothing. Directions?? IF thats what you call them? They are pathetic and wouldn't help a rat find his way out of a hole. I bought this thing because our Linksys Print Server freaked out and would no longer work ""Wirelessly"". After dealing with this Trendnet JUNK I gave the Linksys another try and found out that the IP address had changed and thats why it and laptops ""Were NOT Communicating"". all is well now, Linksys saved me and my wifes marriage as for the Trendnet JUNK... we're having a garage sale and I hope someone buys it before I throw it in the driveway and run over it with the car!!!! JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!"
3,TRENDnet 3-Port Print Server TE100-P21 (Blue),Works well for newer printers. I could not find supporting software for for my HP 1100 laser jet printer. .. .. ... .... ...
3,Could be a lot better,"Pros:* I can successfully print to all 3 printers hooked up to this device.Cons:* Included software could not find the device to configure it* Manual configuration took significantly longer than it should have* Web interface is lacking... Some images/backgrounds always fail to load on all pages, making it difficult to read menu items* Can't view printer ink supply levels from a connected computerBottom line: It works if you have technical knowledge (to configure) and patience. But it could be a lot better."
4,Easy,"Print server replaces an older netgear print server. The TEW-P1UG was easy to setup and is functioning well. I'm using the wired input but may use the wireless capability in the future. Have a number of TrendNet products - router, switches and print server - all work well."
3,Amazon trend net server to multifunction printer,"I was able to get up and running with this server fairly quickly when connecting to my HP laser Jet but I have yet to connect to my HP ink jet multifunction printer. I have been in contact with Trendnets tech department to no avail. The tech department was very professional. I don't think they are allowed to tell you the server just won't work with a multifunction printer. But rather than further frustrate myself and spend another 20 hours trying to unsucessfully figure it out, I am just going to buy a new wireless inkjet printer. I think I can get one for $ 60.00 on sale."
3,Works With Too Many Regrets,"Product is pretty good, but a good product alone could never gain 5 stars without good documentations and fool-proof quick start guide. Fact is the document that comes with the product is worst than none.Anyway, I set it up after quite some hack work. My old HP deskjet 970Cxi works great via the LPT port, but I could never get my HP LaserJet 1000 printing on the USB port of the print server. So if you have an HP laser USB type, beware!Is there anybody who knows how to make HP LaserJet USB printer work with this print server? Please kindly give us some advise here!"
3,repeating last page at times,"The install took me a while to figure out. Two things:1) configure your network to allow 192.168.0.1 for the initial setup. Mine router starts with a different IP, and that got me side tracked a bit.2) ensure personal firewall is turned off before running the install utility. I could not see the printer server because of that.After resolved the two issues, the rest of the install was rather straightforward. The TEST page came out fine on a USB printer. However, in the past week, I had two occasions where the printer kept spewing the last page of a document, it would not stop until I unplug the printer server. It could be the particular file or somthing more. Overall, it's not an easy setup as expected."
4,"Good product, but beware of dynamic IP address","This is a solid product and network enables two older HP printers--one parallel and one USB. Beware of configuring this product to get a dynamic IP address using DHCP. If DHCP changes the server's IP address, the printer description on the PC is not updated accordingly. After recreating the printers on each PC a couple of times, I identified the problem with DHCP and reconfigured the server with a fixed IP address. Problem solved."
3,fine- once set-up,Had some difficulties setting this unit up. Had to call tech support (which was fine). They had me do some things not in the manual to get it up and running. Once this was done it works as advertised.
2,It works for my HP Photosmart C4280,I have a HP Photosmart C4280 that I wanted to work over my network with a wireless HP laptop with Vista and with a desktop tied directly to the Hub through a Cat 5 cable. I got it all working in about two hours. Both the setup for the laptop and desktop did not follow the procedures from Trendnet. You must use a local printer TCP/IP connection for the laptop and you must tell the connection to see a generic 1 port print server (from the Microsoft pull down list). The desktop was set up as port U1 on the network using the setup wizard from Trendnet. The Trendnet support does not exist hence the 2 stars.
4,Works Well,I initially had a problem setting it up. I used the quick install leaflet instead of the manual and could not print any documents. Once I followed the detailed instructions in the manual I was able to print. Have not had any problems since.
1,Useless Tech Support,"I contacted tech support with an issue involving transferring a 4.37gb file.The file crashes at 2.40gb. The person handlng the call couldn't help me. He indicated it would be two days before a high level tech support could get back to me. This nic card is used on a Mac using Leopard operating system and is listed as a compatible card.It was suggested I email tech support with my problem if I wanted an expidited answer to my problem.So I did just that, wrote an email explaining exactly what I was experiencing.I got an expidited answer indicating their product doesn't support Mac.Their tech support didn't even attempt to solve my problem.I will be returning both TrendNet PCITXR Cards.Their support is amongst the worst I have experienced.MB"
1,slecht,Het is geen piano concert maar klavercimbel. Als ik dit had geweten had ik het niet besteld. De levering duurde erg lang maar dat kan ook aan de post gelegen hebben.Ik vul dus een enkel sterretje in en beoordeel deze levering als slecht.
1,Impact drill NOT!!!,Well you get what you pay for! If you want to buy something that looks like an impact drill for filling up the shelf then this is a good buy for you. This drill is made in China and comes with pieces and springs that I still don't know what to do with. There is absolutely NO instructions or documentation with this tool. The buttons that are supposed to switch between drill and hammer do not work. This tool is not a bargain it is a complete waste of money. Now I have to buy a real drill Pass on this one.
1,"Great initially, broke quickly with little use, terrible customer service","I loved this stroller after I bought it...it was lightweight, fit through standard doorways and folded easily, with little effort and was comfortable for the kids. Within 2 years, the plastic connector between frame and handlebars broke, causing the left side to collapse (no injuries).After mailing for repair, I was told it couldn't be repaired and Maclaren would either destroy it for me or mail it back as is. They offered a 'discount' price on a new one, which incidentally was higher than web retailers. By the way, they even gave me the name of web retailers where I could purchase the item for less than they would offer. Terrible customer service.I have found other reviews of wheels falling off another model while strolling (multiple reports) and a similar review of the twin rally model with the handle connector breaking within 18 months of use."
2,outdated information,"This edition date from 1995!! It is becoming seriously outdated, for instance page 28 ""federal state treatment of one-member LLCs remains uncertain"", this is not true anymore, a quick search on the IRS website will give you the answer (you can elect to be treated as sole proprietorship or as corporation). And since this book was published, Vermont and Massachussets have enected LLC laws. Don't buy outdated information, especially in the legal field."
1,A Rip Off,"You can get more more accurate information from your secretary of state for free. The author has taken generalized information from each state, compiled it into a book, and given it a title. The author is a lawyer. Think about it. What do you think you will get from a lawyer for 15 bucks? Not much! I returned the book for a refund."
5,not enough of these books,"Reading this book I felt like the author slapped me in the face and then dunked my head in cold water all the while saying ""look, this is what it's really like!"". I thought I understood everything I needed to about Web services, but this book hit me with a dose of reality that really opened my eyes. It's a big book, and when it first arrived, I looked at it and thought ""no way am I reading all of that"", but once I got into it I didn't want to put it down. Still haven't finished it all, as some of the stuff doesn't pertain to my work, but I got thru a good 75% of it (which is a lot for someone with my attention span). The author of this book has no qualms about stating things the way they really are, as opposed to the way they should be or the way they are advertised to be. I wish there were more books like this."
4,Good,"This is a good overview. It is slowly becoming slightly dated since its examples often refer to specific technologies and would benefit from better copy editing, so only 4 stars."
2,there must be a better speakers,"it sounds better than the integrated psp speakers, but i would recommend another type of speakers. the batteries doesn't long too much, so, if you buy it, think about a good pair of rechargable batteries."
1,CRAP SOUND,"this product SUCKS. yes, it does make the sound alot louder, but the quality of said loud sound is crappy. playing music, games, or even just in general, the sound is crappy. it sounds like an old radio that cant connect to a radio station quite right. the design is alright but the flip from front to back confuses me, mabey its for none playing time bamey its for when you set the psp face-down, whatever the reason, i dont like it. i do not reccomend this product for psp users, or to people who need speakers in general. just stick to computer speakers."
1,Sound Wave speakers,I found four main problems with this product. 1- The sound qulity is good for small speakers. But the overall qulity of the product is bad. 2- The speakers do not fit the psp like they should.They feel like you will break saomething snaping them on. 3- The speaker wire get in the way. 4- You have to take them off every time you want to change a game and that's not that easy to do.PSP Attachable Sound Wave Speakers
2,Works great but...,If you have an external grip that extends your battery life already attached to your PSP this will not work with it. So its either this and without your external battery and grip or your external battery and grip with internal speakers/head phones. Other then that nice sound but because it does not work with my external battery grip I never use it. I'd rather have the extra battery power.
5,PSP Sound Wave Speakers,This is so kool and I listen to my music when I am taking a loooonnnngggg HOT bath. I love that I just ordered it on Monday and it was here on Tuesday that is fast and I will be back for more items from you. Thanks for a great product. I will be telling ALL my face book friends and family about this.
1,Horrible!,The make up sponge was falling apart and sticky like it was very old. I'm afraid to use the make up wondering how old it is! I was very disappointed!!!!
3,Christmas gift,"I purchased this product for my father for Christmas. I haven't listened to the tapes or anything, but my father was pleased so that's all that matters."
1,Flip Flop,"Normally, I really like Johnstone Westerns. The later ones seem to involve so may venues, that one can loose the train of thought of the previous set of ""adventures"", thus the overall book is less enjoyable."
2,Unbelievable,"Can't believe the adventure. Why not just call him superman and have him made of steel, it would be more believable! Kills everyone and walks away with only scratches - all the time and sometimes even without scratches. Friends, indians and all rush to assist him and blood and guts everywhere. Johnstone can't help but repeat himself also. Let me see how many pools of blood, how many jaws blown away? I won't waste my money buying another of his adventures. Prefer real drama and plausible situations and outcomes."
4,excellent movie,"all real ballett lovers should not miss is it, the only document which describes the dancer and choreograf really good"
2,"Lousy transfer, not letterboxed!","I have just receivedNijinskythe dvd transfer. It is not beautifully restored, there is no letterbox, no extras which would have been so interesting. No nothing! INFURIATING!Except for Leslie Browne's pathetic performance, the acting is very fine. Especially interesting is the wonderful Carla Fracci who was not only a great ballerina but a great actress. Even George was good. Beautifully filmed, wonderful, accurate costumes and sets make this a film worth seeing. Sadly, the dance sequences and short and cut. I would have been willing to sit another hour for more, especially the intriguing reconstruction of Jeux. Lets have a dvd with the movie restored to it's original beauty and LOTS OF EXTRAS!!!! The VHS copy is horrible."
4,Excellent Intermediate Classical Repetoire,"This is the second time I've bought this book; I completely wore out my first copy. It has an excellent selection of music from Baroque to Modern, including several pieces that are familiar to most music lovers. Finger suggestions are provided, to the extent of being helpful, but not distracting. In fact, most of the editing has been judicious. This volume will be used and enjoyed for years as the performer will come back to it after having advance to higher levels."
3,Decent song selection but shoddy print quality,"There is a brilliantly wide selection of songs from so many composers with varying styles that you will eventually find something you enjoy. However the binding does not allow the book to stay open, and even holding it in place with weights doesn't keep the book flat. It's a pain to read the notes near the center of the book because it is curving in towards the spine. As well, the print is not as sharp as books from the Schirmer or Alfred's series, so it is more difficult to read chords or distinguish which note has the sharp or flat.I use the book to sample the work of different composers until I find one I like, then I search for another book that has more of their songs."
3,Hard to follow up,"we used this book as main book for my graduate class, it is hard to follow, programming examples are not explained well, information scattered all over, it jumps between chapters for information."
1,Riddled with errors and inaccuarate information,"While the content of the book is fine, the problems are absolutely horrible. Mannino frequently leaves out important information needed to solve the problems, makes typographical errors, references the wrong dates, jumps between different chapters and many other things.On the Chapter 3 assignment for example there are TWO number 7's. One is hidden inside of 6.I would highly not recommend this book."
5,"Great music and recording, but don't get this version.","Yes, the performances of these great Bach organ works are splendid, and the recording is crystal clear. However, as other reviewers have mentioned, this particular CD is too short. Fortunately, it has been reissued in a newer edition which also contains two Franck works recorded in San Francisco.Bach: Fantasia and Fugue in G minor ""The Great"", Franck: Fantaisie in AIf you want more, I'd go for that one instead."
2,CD Review,"I must say that I like Z-Ro and I had this particular album screwed and chopped. This is a good CD by Z-Ro but it sounds a lot better to me screwed and chopped up. For those people from Texas and Houston, TX, y'all know what I'm talking about. I gave this product only 2 stars because I thought the album was chopped and screwed and it wasn't. if it was chopped and screwed i would have gave it a 5 out of 5"
5,It does not scrach cds.,"I work for KSOP AM-FM in Salt Lake City, all of our music is played from cds which are in a computer controled Sony CD Juke box. When it's time to clean these 360 cds a pair of Hydrobaths can zip right through them, totaly clean and no scraches, plus it's fast. *****"
1,Not Appropriate for Home User,"Not mentioned in the description, or on the box, for that matter, is that the 1120 is designed for 'batch' cleanings. So if you have a 100 or so CDs to clean at one time, you might want to give it a look. However, for the typical home user with one or two CDs to clean at a time, look elsewhere..."
2,good and bad,"this is a good unit, im lazy, so i dont want to spend my time wiping cds, and making sure i dont scratch them. This little unit takes care of it all with the push of a button. Just hit start and it spins away and washes the little cd, then it starts spinning the other direction and drys it.it can be used either with an A/C adapter or with 4 AA batteries.Heres the problem, and why it lost 3 stars. These dont last long at all, i dont know if its a design flaw or what, but they seem to last about 6 months, and i dont use mine very much either. So far i have purchased 3 of them, and they all seem to break with in 6 months to a year.I tried contacting the company tht makes them, but they dont respond, so, if you have another option, id go with it, and try to shy away from this one."
3,Discwasher1120 cd cleaner review,"I like this product alot. It is easy to use, I do not have to worry about drying the CD and scratching it. That is all done by the washer. My only complaint is that the cleaning solution is hard to find. I can find the unit easily enough, but finding the refill for the cleaning solution is like finding Hens teeth!!!@I am going to order direct form the company as a last resort! If you sell the product why don't you sell the refills for the solution!!! Thank you"
5,Superior Touchless CD/DVD Cleaning,"I understand that the manufacturer of this product, Recoton, went out of business. I'm surprised another manufacturer hasn't come out with a similar cleaning system. Clearly, it's a superior method of cleaning due to the no touch cleaning process.I used to work in the now defunct California department store chain Fedco which carried this product. I remember testing it out many times by trying to smudge up the discs as much as I could. The machine could not be defeated as it clean them spotless each time just from the hi-speed spinning of the discs in the fluid! No rubbing and scratching involved."
3,Topaz,I finished Topaz about a month ago and can barely remember anything about it. Was an interesting read but had no staying power.
1,kanamaham.,the condition of the book is not the same as the seller had indicated.the seller should have been honest.
5,Geri Is The Best,Okay.. Mi Chico Latino... I love the song and I love Geri. Geri is such a great person and has a great attitude in her music and just in general. I know Geri is such a sweetie and I love her and and her music. I see a bright future ahead for her. I think if you like anything pop and latin you will love Geri Halliwell. Geri is not only a singer she is a UN Goodwill Ambassador and works for Marie Stopes... maybe even a upcomming actress hopefully. Geri is just the best. I love Geri!
5,"Geri's first number 1, need I say more? Of course!","As most of Geri's fans know, ""Look at Me"" (her debut single) failed to reach number 1 (only number 2, what a shame). But now a song much more worthy of the number one slot has reached the top of the charts (""Mi Chico Latino""). Not only do the Spanish beats get you going, but Geri's voice shines through and makes it easy to remember the lyrics. Not only do you get ""Mi Chico Latino"", but 2 bonus tracks (""G.A.Y."" and ""Summertime"") and an enhanced element which contains the mediocre video to the title track. Though ""G.A.Y."" is perfect for clubs and gay people, I'm personally not much of a fan of it, but ""Summertime"", on the other hand, is actually wonderful. It shows Geri's surprising high range and is the perfect sultry summer song. (It shoulda been on the album instead of the awful ""Goodnight Kiss"".) I recommend this single even to non-Geri fans because it's good music, and that's the bottom line cuz JAMES said so."
5,G.A.Y.,"Why was this not included on her debut? Oh my god, this song is FABU! As much as i like ""mi chico latino"", ""G.A.Y."" is by far the highlight of this single. It's such a great dance song, I hope the gay clubs take to it because it could be huge! ""Come on everybody let's get G.A.Y."" It could be the next gay anthem..."
5,Geri's Best Single,"This single (the 1st one) really really deserves 5 stars. Track 1 (original version) is a amazing latin pop song, arragements are good and vocal is sexy. Although Geri commits some spanish mistakes, it's my fav track from Schizophonic. Track 2 (G.A.Y.), if you like Bag It Up (I love it), you'll love this dance song that honors disco years. The beat is fast, her vocal is good. Track 3 (Summertime) is different from everything she's done. The lyrics are silly but the vocal is so much sexy! Plus, there's her best video (Mi Chico Latino) in .mov format."
5,Better Than You'd Expect,"The only reason to get this CD is for the song G.A.Y -- which I'm guessing is inspired by the Astoria Theater in London which hosts G.A.Y. This song should have been on her album and should have been the first single. It's irresistable and surpasses anything this Spice Girls ever could have dreamed up. BTW, G.A.Y -- both the club and song -- mean Good As You!"
2,"Are you all ""loco""??","I really wonder why you all give five stars for that song. When I first heard it, I really had to laugh. The English housewife Geri sings Latino, of course not only because Latin music is the hype at the moment... Hmm.. the song is somewhat entertaining, but absolutely tasteless - and in my opinion Geri cannot really sing. It is so bad that it is kind of funny to listen to. (Thats the reason why I give TWO stars (not five!!?)."
5,Awesome for butt and for head.,"I bought a pair of these for a river canoing trip. I sat on them in the canoe and slept on them in the tent. They performed marvelously and my trip was comfortable as possible thanks to these beauties. Tough as nails, too."
4,Great soft blues,"Sounds nothing like ""Midnight at the Oasis,"" but there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it sounds like she's been taking voice lessons from Bonnie Raitt. Bonnie does guest vocals on one song, Huey Lewis plays *great* blues harmonica on another. Great blues guitar from Cranston Clements all the way through. Best songs are Home of the Blues, Somebody Was Watching Over Me, Can't Pin Yo' Spin On Me. Well, Well, Well and Strange and Foreign Land (both with Mavis Staples) are also standouts. If you like slow and mid-tempo swamp blues, this one won't disappoint."
2,Compact but...,"I'm currently taking a Intro to CAGD course with the author of this book. Taken with the class, it's might be a good reference book, but it is definitely not for the faint of heart. Unless you are very comfortable with vector math and linear algebra, I'd say that you will have a very hard time trying to learn CAGD from the book alone. This being the first edition, there are also a lot of errors (the reflection light algorithm for surface is incomplete, for example).If you are somewhat of a computer graphics expert, you may find this book a good reference on the ""math"" of surface, curves, etc. However, in that case, you would still probably be better off getting one of the author's other books.Also, this is not a computer graphics book. You will not find anything about 3D viewing, graphics pipelining, rendering, or anything like that. It's strictly computer-aided geometric design."
4,Seems to work fine,"I have used other brands in my dishwasher and this product seems to work just as well as the others.I have always wondered if rinse aids do anything, but the maker of the dishwasher suggests it, so I buy it. Besides, when the dishwasher runs out, on mine, there is a red light to indicate the rinse aid needs refilling and it bugs me to see that light :-)The angle on the spout does make it easy to pour and the push down lid seems to lock the spout just fine.I does come in a case of 8 bottles, in my case (no pun intended), that will last me at least 2 years. Thank goodness it doesn't expire. It arrived shipped in a double box, so there appears to be no issue with the shipping (I am always worried when I order liquids they will show up leaking - not in this case).I rated it 4 stars as the shipping is free as stated - but 8 bottles?! I traded off having the extra bottles for free shipping."
5,Good period drama,"Carrie's War surprised me in presenting the main character as a confident and brave young teen. It is hard enough to imagine evacuation to the countryside with forced separation from parents, but to have no certain place to go? How would any youngster handle it? Timid and frightened. Even after they were relectantly chosen at last, they ended up in the home of a serious disciplinarian.Carrie and even her little brother take it all in stride and even manage to enjoy their situation. Carrie is certainly not a Pollyanna, but she does manage to win over most around her. She also begins to discover boys. But it isn't until the end of her stay that she cracks through the thick skin of her disciplinarian host in the countryside.Carrie's War is a good family movie and a great movie for young girls who need strong role models."
3,Ending Leaves Damper on Film,"Excellent movie, theme, actors, scenery until the incredibly disappointing ending. The author gave up and created a cheesy ending that didn't seem to have anything to do with the first 99% of the movie. We felt like we were watching two completely different movies. If it had been written differently, this would have been one we would have watched over and over. Instead we turned it off and said, ""What was that?"" It has gone into the Good Will basket."
1,need for better information,"this dvd cannot be viewed on our machine, ridiculous for a dvd made with the cooperation of european t v companies. better information is required!"
2,boring,"I was bored to death and almost fell asleep. You might have to be british to enjoy this. I already gave my copy to a friend who might maybe like it better than I did. The DVD-Cover looks nice, though."
4,Anglers Guide to hatches/flies,Of the books we were handed to perused at a fly fishing class I liked this one the best. It compared the different flies to the different stages of what the Trout thrive on.I needed to learn this if I continue to dabble in fly fishing.
1,Beware,"This movie definitely needs a warning for explicit sexual content. It seems as if every other scene tries to outdo the one before it in terms of grossness and perverse activity. In addition, one does not learn much about Rasputin and his interaction with the royal family. If I would have had an inkling as to the way this period of time was presented, I would NEVER have purchased this movie."
1,COSTUME - not a real coat,Mine had a string tie at the back of the neck like children's costumes. Thin material. WAY overpriced pos. Nice shades 8)
4,somewhere between good and great,it's interesting to watch these Series progress over the years Jack McCoy in every compacity keeps to show completely compelling the 1 thing I don't like about this season is that they keep changing detectives.
5,law and order all the same,"If you love the law and order shows than you will love these too, season 20 and I still watch them"
4,Big fan of the show,"If you are a fan of the show like I am, this worth downloading. I like watching the earlier shows with Chris Noth."
4,Law and Order Season 20,"Fantastic season, glad I was finally able to see. They should not have canceled this show. The writing and acting will be greatly missed by the fans of the show."
4,Jeremy Sisto Given Wonderful Opportunity To Make Fool Of Himself,"I really like Jeremy Sisto as one of the detectives on this show. He formerly played Billy on 6 FEET UNDER and had a fans from there he's carried to this show. This episode gives him the star turn this time of making a prime jackass out of himself over the female star witness in a case he is working. Even worse, as the case goes forward, it begins to seem that she is less a witness and more a suspect. The expression ""sweating bullets"" could have been coined for him for this episode. I really enjoyed seeing Sisto get a meatier role this time out. I hope the show does it again."
5,Cell Phone Kidnapping Scam Leads To Terrorists,"This episode opens with a scam I would have never imagined in my wildest dreams. Kids often lose their cell phones. Criminals recover these cells, phone the parents from them, claim they've kidnapped the child and demand a ransom for the kid's return. They don't even have the kid, just the phone. The relationship this scam has to the episode is that criminals may use this scam, among others, to finance terrorist activities. The team tries to bring down a terrorist cell in New York City when they prevent one of these scams from completion."
2,HD quality very disappointing,"I was very disappointed at the picture quality of the supposedly HD streaming of the Law and Order season preview 2009-10. I used my HP HDX16-1200, on which I am now watching beautiful 720p HD but this transmission (of L&O) was strictly standard resolution. What gives?"
3,Not On Par or even close to His Best but it has it's moments,I've followed Ray Charles's Music since I was a Little Boy&have been Impressed by the many styles the Man Plays&Sings.the Man understands Concepts.you name a Style or a Chart&chances are Ray Charles has been there&done it with ease.this Album is alright at best.His Vocals&a few songs are alright but overall it feels like the Best Elements of His Genius are being Sucked right out.He can't escape the Latest Sound that is sprinkled all through here&that is a Bad thing.for if Ray Charles strips the Music down here you have a Cool Record.seek out his Box Sets&His Work with His Running Buddy Quincy Jones on a Album they did back in the 50's.there is alot to pick from with Brother Ray but this isn't the best place to start.
1,Very poor.,"I have a large collection of Rays albums stretching from the late fifties up until the present time. Although Ray hasnt produced anything ground breaking since the mid to late 1960's, on the whole, his later lp's always contain a couple of gems. Even Rays run in with the hard funk/disco sound in the late 70's early 80's had interesting and entertaining moments. At their core they were new ways or presenting Ray's inherent soul and grit.This particular cd is awfull im afraid. Weak songs, terrible production, nasty mixing, etc. Its an all round mess and in my opinion its a miracle Ray released it. No soul, no atmosphere, no tunes."
3,"""I Just Can't Get Enough of You"" alone is worth the CD price","Perhaps this CD doesn't reflect the old Ray Charles, but the track ""I Just Can't Get Enough of You"" has struck a chord with east coast beach music fans. This tune hit the Top 40 Beach Music Chart a short while back rising to #12 and staying on the Top 40 for over 20 weeks. Due to this popularity, reviewers within this specialized genre were saying that Ray with this CD and James Brown with his ""Next Step"" album together produced the most refreshing and ""baddest"" sounds within the soul genre today. Surprisingly, they were among the oldest of recording artists at the time of these releases. Ray will be greatly missed."
4,I a good deal,"I got one and i starting thinkin' that maybe it was too small. so i put in my GBA and it was a great fit ...duh, so i put in one of my games and then another i was able to fit four games in. the only problem is the lack of room for acessories (thats why it only has four).other than that it is a good deal affordable and protective."
1,To small for anything! Avoid!,"I bought this case as my first case for my brand new GBA SP the first day they came out last year (I work in video games, I have to have the newest coolest things! : ) I have a substancial number of GBA games, and I thought I could buy this to keep my GBA in my backpack with a game or two. WRONG! The case is so tight, even putting 1 game in the case is an exercise in masochism. You can't get the game out. Yes it's a spiffy color blue, and yes it's small, but if it only holds one game, it's not really worth it. What I did was bought a slightly bigger GBA case for the same amount, and that works just as well. The older GBA case if I had an older one would only hold one game with the case, but because it's the smaller SP, it holds several."
5,Best Diaper Rash Cream,A little know secret this cream works great for kids diaper rash and for adults sore behinds. I tried all other diaper rash ointments and this one does the best job. My son giggles every time he sees it after pooping because it gives instant relief.
5,Great product!,I was told by a friend who is a nurse to use this for diaper rash and it will work wonders. I was a little skeptical but tried it and was amazed how great this product is. Now I am on our second child and swear by this stuff and wont use anything else .
1,"Warhammer 40K: Fire Warrior is Snoozehammer 40K, ZZZzzzz...","Don't buy this, you will only encourage people to write crummy games - even cheap, it's a waste of money.There are no saves, the player has to complete missions or objectives or start over. The graphics are uninteresting as is the game design.Even the plot is lame. Be the good 'Tau' and kill the evil humans. This may appeal to Columbine types, I suppose.Save your money and buy Max Payne 2, a bit lame but much more fun to play as a shooter. It has some atmosphere too."
1,Old; and it shows.,"Although it's cool to see the various foes of Warhammer 40k up close, this game is dated, with crude graphics and sloppy mechanics. The UI in particular is very poorly designed - with large, maze-like areas and no objective markers or reminders, getting lost is nearly inevitable. On top of that, the weapons work unpredictably and poorly - even rifles have extreme inaccuracy and do miniscule damage, requiring almost a clip of ammunition to kill a single opponent.If you're looking for a fun first-person shooter, this game is not for you. If you just want to run around in the Warhammer 40k universe....well, there might be better ways to do it, but this game will do it. Don't expect good graphics, though."
1,"Obsolete port, unplayable on modern PC.","The PC port of this game I foolishly didn't investigate is made by a company that apparently makes slap dash ports of console games. It had been so long since this came out I thought this was direct from publisher pc version. Suffice to say, unless you still have a dinasaur computer running xp still, this game will not run on Windows 7. (Game itself is pretty much crap, but does do a good job in a few places of just giving a feel for warhammer 40k artistically. Mainly the levels on assorted space craft, seeing the Marine gothic chapel shaped ships etc.) I knew that the game itself wasn't great going in, but was purchasing again as I'd played through on PS2 ages ago and wanted to replay some of the few scenic levels as well as introduce it to someone as an example of 40k aesthetics."
3,"Warhammer 40,000: Fire Warrior","This is a decent FPS, though some times your left clueless ass to where to go next. It's definitely for the die hard 40k gamers."
5,Rumiko does it again!,"Ranma 1/2 is one of the many great mangas by Rumiko Takahashi. Can you imagine a boy who can turn into a girl with a splash of cold water and back again with hot water? Well even if you can't, Takahashi has. Filled with drama, suspense, endearing love, and great slap-stick comedy Ranma 1/2 is one of the best mangas out there! But warning to some: there is some nudity of character, nothing is really shown except the upper female anatomy but it's all in good humor, no sexual situations."
3,Radio install kit,"Item came before estimated ship date. Came as said, in new condition. The problem even looking at the manufactures web site, the product description did not give me enough information on the application vehicles that it went to. Although this product did fit my vehicle will not ship back do to the low cost."
3,Insight to the Scriptures,There are stories that I have heard and/or read from the Bible but never before did I had as much understanding of them as I have since gaining insight of them from this book. I'm almost done with it and so far… so good.
2,cheap phone case,"Although the chargers work well, I was disappointed in the phone case. It's flimsy and too deep for my phone-it flops back and forth in the case with any vigorous walking or movement. I would suggest buying the chargers separately and then looking into a better quality case. Actually, I'm looking for a better case now."
1,Boring,"I bought this DVD based on a childhood memory of the movie ECCO. What may have been cutting edge weirdness in 1966 is absolute boring nonsense in 2011. Even the narration borders on monotone. Neither movie has anything of interest and nothing that could remotely be considered shocking today, not even the somewhat famous reindeer castration scene. Almost as boring as the so called ""thriller"" Gods Of Ruin. Do not waste your time or money on this garbage."
2,history and revealing,"Both films are of historical value and farely accuarat as far as the swedish oddities goes of which I can be a judge, since I have lived in Stockholm in those times. This goes for the film ""ecco"".The beauty of these documentaries pointed out as fraud, is that we, if we are intelligent enough, realize that everything we see and hear about history is fraud, unless it corresponds with our own view of life, which, by and large, means that the more moral amongst us always have the more accurate history to convey unless they are brainwashed into believing the ""official"" history.For further enlightenment see ""Wag the Dog"".O yeah, I almost forgot, it's nice to hear the voice of George Sanders, one of my favorite actors!"
5,JVC Digital Video Camcorder Battery,"The CL-607 JVC Digital Video Camcorder battery looked a little different from the original battery. The new battery worked and fit perfectly in the camera, just like the original."
4,Great for Dora lovers!!,We got this for my daughter for Christmas and she just loves it. The music is a little loud but she highly enjoys it.
5,Entertaining,"This trike was brought for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday. She was totally entertained with all the buttons, lights and Dora talking. Highly recommend, you can't go wrong with Fisher Price for durable toys. Brought Fisher Price toys for my own children over 30 years ago and still have some that my grandchildren now play with too."
3,poor traction,"I purchased this trike at Meijers for my 3yr old daughter. She loves the sounds that it make, its gets annoying afterwhile when the trike is in doors and it is very loud. My daughter was getting frustrated that the wheel kept slipping on the concrete. Her feet can reach the petals but she has to scoot herself around because of the horrible traction."
2,Dont buy for outside use...,"I got this for my 3 year old for her birthday. It rides just great in the basement but as soon as we took it outside, it didnt ride so well. It isnt made for any type of outside riding. I spent the majority of the time pushing my daughter while she attempted to pedal. Its very cute and the sounds are adorable but as far as riding...its a big NO."
3,better for an older child,"My mother bought this tricycle for my daughter's 2nd birthday, and we were so excited putting it together because she's crazy about Dora. Two of the stickers ripped in half when I tried to peel them off the paper, even though I was careful, so I wasn't too happy about that. The buttons are also very loud, which is probably okay if you're outside, but I would like to have a switch to turn the volume down for indoor use.Everything else aside, however, my biggest problem came when my daughter tried to ride her new bike. She is 35 inches tall (75th percentile), yet only one foot reached a pedal...it will be several more months before she can even begin to use this tricycle. The seat was on the closest setting, too. We'll be returning this product if possible and getting a bike designed for 18 months to 3 years."
3,Nice,"I bought this trike from Toys R Us this past weekend for my just turned 4 year old daughter.Assembly was easy and the sounds it offers on the dashboard area were very cute and loud enough to hear as your little one pedals about.Only draw back is that the adjustable seat is awfully close to the frame. My daughter kept hitting her knees on the handlebars. And when I adjust thye seat to a lower position, she has a hard time pedaling, and she is pretty tall. Another drawback is that the wheels are make of plastic, and when she begins to pedal, the wheel ""slips"" on the cemenet and doesnt get well traction and which can be a bit upseting for kids.So I actually returned the trike and got one with ribber wheels. Now my faughter is very pleased with the new exchange!!"
1,Disappointed in Trike,"We purchased the Trike for our 3 year old daughter. The assembly was fairly easy. However, the plastic wheels have zero traction which makes it extremely difficult for her to ride. She's ended up pushing with her legs the majority of the time. Although she loved the sounds/lights/buttons, it's not practical for riding. We were very disappointed in the quality and would not buy again."
3,assembly sucks!,"my daughter got it for her second birthday and loves it.The problem is assembling it. If you dont have power tools dont buy it. It says on the box that you just need a hammer and screwdriver but you need an electric screwdriver for assembly because in one of the parts you have to screw through the plastic and make a hole that should be there to begin with.It is a nice toy though, she loves the music."
5,Elvira,"Great! I loved it.Alexandre Pires sings with other Brazilian famous singers as Caetano, Gilberto Gil,... his most popular songs in a great way. higly recommended for all those with ""saudade"" of Brazil and for those who enjoys Brazilian music and spirit."
5,Imprudence is better,"I love this film, i think Fitzpatrick is one of the greatest up and coming directors right now, but ive gotta say i think imprudence is better. It has a better plot and more interesting characters. The Changers is awesome, and it has some amazing action sequences and scenes, and the characters are fun, and i had a great time viewing, but when it comes down to comparing the two, Imprudence is better, hands down. Imprudence may be cheasy, but i like it alot more."
5,Love Enchanted,"Excellent for anyone who loved this Disney film. Even us 30 something year old ""girls""!!!! ;) For the princess in all of us!"
4,The Art of Teaching Art to Children,The book is very informative and provides many suggestions that have been useful to me. Including more photos and breaking it down into shorter paragraphs would make it more of a quick reference book.
1,way too bright!,"i was looking for a shimmering gold color and got this instead. It's a really bright orange/salmon color and its really unattractive. I only used a tiny bit and it made me look like i had pink eye. My advice, go into sephora and try these on before buying on line. I went in and exchanged this for a metallic shadow that was far better."
1,Disappointed,"Let me begin by saying how excited I was when I picked up this DVD. However, as the first track passed, it was very apparent that the quality of Bob Dylan's performance was definitely lacking. I'm sitting here guzzling a couple beers to contain my frustration. I would strongly discourage anyone from getting this awful DVD."
5,Feels like Bob Dylan,"I have watched music performed, I have listened to music performed, but never have I felt music performed until Bob Dylan. I have loved him for 30 years and if this video doesn't make you fall in love with Bob Dylan you never will. I can watch this video over and over and still not understand how one man can have so much talent inside. This video is a must for anyone who appreciates the man and his lyrics and his unyielding ability to make you feel his music."
5,"Bob was so much younger then, tho he's rockin' better now.","This DVD is made by MTV, and it's got weird lighting, that's of course, really cool. The songs are good, & Bob was young-ish, so buy it for sure, or you'll never own a Bob Dylan DVD. (He signed each disc himself (not really.)). It's all acoustic, even the upright bass player. He uses no elctric guitars, but it's still really good."
3,Average,"I usually watch these videos many times - this one I had to cut short. Nice to have for collecting reasons,,,but a waste of money. The PBS film on Dylan is wonderful."
5,The Next Generation of R&B,"""Child Support"" is undoubtedly one of the best albums of the year. As you listen to the album you will notice that each song seems to be crafted through a true-life story or occurrence. Joaquin's amazing vocals bring each and everyone of these tracks to life. This is a great example of skillful contemporary urban/soul songwriting, with memorable melodies, and effective hooks which keeps all of the songs on the album commercially viable. While many artists these days seem to think using prefabricated hip hop beats counts as solid R&B, ""Child Support"" has an almost acoustic feel to half of the songs on the album, something that it's listeners will quickly get hooked on. ""She's Gone"" (my favorite track on the album) is one of the most emotionally compelling recordings that I have ever heard. For those of you that have lost a loved one - I am positive that you will be able to relate to this song. The bottom line is.. THIS ALBUM IS HOT!"
5,Funk Radio,"If you are looking for a fresh new sound and you are not afraid to check out new music look for Joaquin(Wah-Keen)- Child Support. I have enjoyed this entire CD. I heard the single ""Michelle"" and I wanted to hear more. I have a weekly radio program and Michelle is requested weekly. Joaquin if you read the reviews on this page we can't wait to hear what you do next. Great Job love the CD."
4,Computer fun for your toddler,"My 22 month old has had this system since she was 12 months old, and she loves it, so I added more software. She loves to laugh at the characters and push the buttons on her favorite action scenes. This is a great way to learn reasoning skills and cause and effect with computer and keyboard."
1,Masterful and needs to be reissued with useful formatting,"This is, as other reviewers have said, a definitive and outstanding recording. But whose idea was it to put everything on two tracks? It is impossible to select sections to enjoy or to compare with other recordings. And overpriced at 40 minutes 40 seconds of music."
5,Gift,For my mother and exactly what she wanted. Received quickly and efficiently. 8 more words required and i'm out of things to say.
3,This book is for charcoal cooking not oven cooking,This is a great book for cooking with a fire/Briquettes. it is very good for its intended use. The description could be better or it would helpful to be able to see pages in side the book.
4,Fits as advertised,This product fit my dash perfectly and my new radio was mounted with ease. The only complaint is that the pocket and stud on the back are too shallow and do not mate with the stabilizing mount in the dash. Only time will tell if that is a problem.
5,Great Bluegrass,This album brings back many pleasant memories. We live around 10 miles from the radio station WHOW where this album was made back in the 60s. I remember listening to The Bray Brothers and many other artists on this station. The fidelity on this album is very good even compared to today's recordings. I have heard that the Bray Brothers only used one mike and whoever was taking a lead would step up to the mike. I would reccomend this album to any bluegrass fan.
4,good early book on gay parents,"I read this book while doing an internship at the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco. The editor, F. Bozett, was an expert on gay fathers just as Cynthia Patterson is an expert on lesbian mothers. The book covers many relevant subjects such as gay foster parents, gay parents in heterosexual marriages, etc. ... This book is designed more for researchers and college students. Still, I think Mr. Gay John Doe and Ms. Lesbian Jane Doe would find it accessible and interesting."
3,"It's ""Electric"".","This album may not sound like what you'd expect a ""Monster Magnet-Soundgarden"" fusion to sound like (which I have fantasized about), but it's still pretty sweet. It's more a psychedelic garage-rock kind of thing, than the grunge/stoner rock of their former bands. I haven't completely absorbed this album yet, but ""Compellor"" sounds like the strongest song, and ""Red Light Green Light"" and ""Good Pushin'"" are good too. The guitar work of ""John McBain"" is decent, and I also like hearing ""Matt Cameron"" sing as he beats the skins. ""Josh Homme"" from ""QOTSA"" also guests on a few tracks. Overall it's pretty good, just ""Outshined"" by their old bands."
4,Great starting point,"This book is clear and readable -- not your average text book. I'm making a mid-life career change from architect to patent writer for the semiconductor industry. This book has been invaluable. It's not full of a lot of formulas or theory, but it will definitely help you understand what is involved in manufacturing semiconductor devices. The only things I might ask for are 1)Better Prufreeding, and B) more pictures of the process machinery; there are a few, but the author relies mainly on diagrammatic drawings to illustrate equipment. But, that said, there are a lot of drawings and they are very well drawn (unlike some of the fuzzy drawing representations in Wolf's Vol. 1 of Semiconductor Devices for the VLSI Era. The VanZant book is way cheaper, too)."
2,Decent but not great,"This book is decent for the layperson trying to grasp the semiconductor process, but not great. Some of the examples and explanation make the topic easy to understand, but the chapters don't really flow and you are likely to get confused when the book delves into technical depth. The typos and errors are distracting and it's blatant that the book was rushed to publishing."
1,I was not impressed,"I was not at all impressed with this book. I have found more information, with more clear illustrations and samples in books that are a fraction of the cost. The author makes several mistakes throughout this book regarding the fabrication of microchips. I did not find the book to be up to date as far as current standards and practices. I highly reccomend that anyone interested in this subject find a more current book. If a person is interested in fabrication techniques from 5 years ago, then this book will fit that need. If a person wants to be knowledgeable about current methods then avoid this book like the plague. I would get my money back if I could."
3,"Poorly written, poorly edited, but you still have to read it","English is not my first language, I still find this book painful to read. It took me a weekend to munch down the top one third of this book, a biography of Seymour Cray, and six Japanese comic books. I find this book among them, the worst prepared one.With so many errors in it, I kept grabbing my hair. Many mistakes are so easy to spot, I can usually randomly filp over ten pages, and spot an error. Many of them are really serious, they really can mislead a student, if he/she lacked proper training in science. Say on one page, ozone was mistakenly printed as O2 rather than O3. There are some other unbalanced chemical formula as well. Some math formula are also poorly written or presented.Read it, but be careful. It can be a mine field."
5,Perfect for travel and cleaning up the counter in your master bath,This is a great product. It has a nice clean look and the lid is great for travel
5,"Handsome, Sturdy, Metal Travel Soap Bowl","I really like this shaving soap bowl. It is stainless steel or nickel-plated brass (can't tell which). The top and bottom do not screw together, but rather fit together snugly. Although it is a bit large, it is still very handsome. I use it with my travel badger brush. A super combo. Well worth the money."
3,No screw lid,"This is a pretty nice chrome shave dish for the price but not that wonderful for travel as the lid is only held on by friction. In most cases, I believe you could probably travel with it and get away with it not opening but I was expecting a screw lid that would make it more durable and reliable for travel. Fast delivery and reliable customer service."
4,prom queen meets gothenburg,"This CD still has the old prom queen flavour,but was produced in gothenberg like most good metal,and has a heavier sound and better production,although it has lost a little of what made their earlier album special,this does at times sound a bit like dark tranquillity,etc,which is both good and also makes the band sound a bit less unique.The tracks tend to all sound similar at first,but it certainly grows on you if you like metal as well as metalcore.If you liked their first album this is likely to appeal,as well as being a good metal album in a time sadly lacking in decent metal.Unfortunately the band are now also recently deceased."
2,I Killed the Prom Queen ~Music for the Recently Deceased~,"As the first notes of """"Shakes in Your Mouth"""" and """"Say Goodbye"""" wrong through my speakers, there's one band that comes to mind immediately: As I Lay Dying. These guys are performing a style of Gothenburg hardcore made famous over here in the States by As I Lay Dying. In fact, it would be tough to say that there is much of anything separating the two bands save the few thousand miles between Australia and America.Slow beatdown sections, fast paced Gothenburg riffs that sound eerily like In Flames/At The Gates b-sides and clean vocals that tie back to the aforementioned As I Lay Dying sum up what this band is about. It gets so bad that """"The Deepest Sleep"""" sounds like it could be a cover of an As I Lay Dying song.Skip it.For Fans of: As I Lay Dying, In Flames, Killswitch Engage"
2,Too Predictable,"I seriously think it's about time we gave this metalcore craze a rest. Well, there are bands of that style who make themselves unique and get more respect, but for each one of those, we have about 20 generic Caliban/As I Lay Dying/KsE clones that do nothing new. This CD has what your average metalcore CD has: rehashed melodeath-inspired riffs, average screaming/clean singing vocals, and don't forget the breakdowns. Overall, this CD, while it's not unlistenable, is rather mediocre at best and represents well that the metalcore sponge cannot absorb any more. If you don't care about originality and like the styles of the bands I mentioned earlier, then you might like this. However, if you're looking for metalcore that's, well, not boring, go for Parkway Drive, Misery Signals, Heaven Shall Burn, All That Remains, and Unearth."
1,"Ordered twice, and twice AMAZON sent me the wrong item... I gave up.","I ordered this item, then AMAZON sent me another model (BALET TYPE) shoes... I returned it, tried to explain the reason (but I think nobody even reads what we write)... I ordered AGAIN the same shoes, and guess what? AMAZON sent me AGAIN the same Naturino Balet Model.Too time consuming... Keeping ordering and returning products. I understand there is something wrong with the CODE of this product with the whatever catalog they use to send the item... But I gave up ordering this product."
3,Condition,Ordered this book in good- very good condition. I think they may be confused on what that means. This book is rough condition. Will not order from them again.
2,Not for toddlers,"My 2 year old son likes a story before bed. We have some of the other Disney story books and we got this one because it had alot of the more ""boyish"" characters like Tarzan, Buzz, and Peter Pan.Well, I started reading him the first story where Tarzan is apparently atttacked by a cheetah, then another gorilla tries to help and he also ends up getting hurt. Then Tarzan pulls out his spear and it goes on from there. Rather violent activities for a 2 year old to hear.Okay, maybe the story about Pooh was better? In that story, Tigger bounces onto a log across 2 cliffs, the others try to help him off and they all fall into the ravine. They are all okay, but this is in NO WAY the kind of story that I want to read to my son.Maybe these kinds of stories are better suited to older boys, but DO NOT get this book for any child under 3!!!"
3,subtitles,"I rented this movie online from Amazon. They forgot to put anyplace in the description that it was subtitled. Had I known I would not have rented it. But I guess Amazon doesn't really care about that, they already got their money. A misleading advert."
4,Foreign films,"Foreign films give me an opportunity to focus on the quality of acting, because I must truly THINK about whether the subtitles and the actors' performances synch. In this movie, the performances are universally strong. Likewise, the production values are quite high for an independent film of the 1990s (unless independents in Germany at that were waaaaay better than in the US). The storyline of this film was engaging and entertaining, and the dramatic tension between our gay and straight protagonists kept my attention until the final credits rolled. If you like foreign films and good acting, with a storyline that features sympathetic characters, hit your Amazon one-click purchase button to rent this movie."
4,a fine comedy,"This was a very nice comedy involving some unlikely situations, that nevertheless avoided stereotypes and predictable story lines. The actors were all outstanding."
3,It's ok,It's ok. Too bad there are not more good gay romance movies. I just thought this was so so. Thanks
3,"Worth a hire, not a buy!","Firstly, I did not realize at the time of purchase that it was a German(?) language film and was subtitled. Whilst that did not bother me, the person with whom I viewed the film did mind. Acting was good, story line was interesting and not too predictable, and without having to rely on sex scenes for interest. Worth a casual watch but probably not a most memorable film."
4,"Entertaining, good story line. Just fun with a message.","Boy meets man, man likes girl, boy has to come to terms with it. But in the end everyone gets something. Funny, but not too much. Just the right amount to keep it real. I have already watched it twice."
4,Good Movie,"After reading the other reviews for this movie I gave it a shot. I felt that it was a worthwile movie which was good. There are so many gay theme movies out there that aren't worth the time watching, but this one was, as I enjoyed it. I guess it's all what you are looking for in a movie."
3,Predictable but funny in spots.,"The movies and its premise were good although very predictable. Honestly, the plot has been done before in many other movies. While I enjoyed the movie it tended to drag a little bit too much for me. It is good see once movie."
4,Great buy but a bit too big,"I was expecting this to be a bit smaller but this size is just as equivalent as a fanny pack would be. The construction is very durable as is with any Maxpedition product. The wallet does contain all of my wallet contents and phone well. Because it is too big to be placed on my belt, I generally carry it around which poses a problem with theft and loss."
2,Kinda small,I love Maxpedition products. I wanted this wallet to be used with my iPhone 4 with an Otterbox Commuter and the Otterbox Defender case. Neither Otterbox case fits in the assigned phone pocket. A little upset since I want to use the wallet and want to keep a case on my expensive iPhone. I guess I have to find another way! I'm sure that I will find another use of the RAT Wallet!
1,So disappointed - sounds like a grade eight mix tape,"I have been a fan of the Fabriclive releases since the first one. I can't even believe that this album is associated with the same series that brought us epic mixes by the likes of Freeland and Lavelle. The tracks aren't even mixed (or remixed). It's like I went and downloaded a bunch of songs that I liked, burned them onto a CD, played them on random while pretending to ""DJ"" at a club. Shameful, I wish I could get my money back for this one. I wish I could give it a ""zero"" rating."
1,Terrible makeover!,"I bought this as a followup to the original Buns of Steel--- and what a let down! The beginning aerobic part is tough to follow, and the three women were just too cheery. I'll take the original guy with the corny hair and music any time. HIS workout really WORKS!"
4,Fabulous!,"I love this album. It's Fast-paced audio and noise rock is just an experience in itself. The all the tracks show a good diversity of tempos, beats and sounds. However, It's similar to K.K Null's Atomik Disorder in that it hints towards chaos. Over all it's a great CD, if you're bored by mainstream garbage, I'm not even sure what Genre this Cd would belong."
3,"Jazz, glitch and click don't mix","It appears as though End wanted to fill some sort of gap in the electronic music spectrum. Although the tracks are crisp and clean, it was almost embarrassing to play it out loud. I can only describe it as immature, throwing a jazz riff here and a Sitar riff there. It sounds like Autechre regressed back to grade school, only End has less purpose and direction in thier tracks. I apologize for the negative criticism, but I just don't see this as a keeper. Even buying it used didn't soften the blow of an album which shouldn't have been. Three stars for putting in the effort to produce the album, but no more. You'd be well advised to spend your cash elsewhere."
3,havent heard the album yet...its in the mail.,"I saw Fantomas play in Austin, Tx a few weeks ago. This guy walked out onto the stage before the show and started messing with a laptop that was sitting on a table. At first it seemed like he was prepping some stuff for the first act to go on. Then he cranked it up, the beats kicked in and we heard the end.It was great stuff. All done by one guy and his laptop mostly.Worth checking out, this stuff sounds good."
2,Ad Is Misleading Or There Is Serious Incompetence,"I ordered these Exhaust pipes and was lead to believe that they would work with a Stock Kicker? My Bike Is A 1980 FXS Which I Recently Checked Again And It Says That They Should Fit However, Since I have Both Electric Start and Kick I seldom use the Kicker. Until recently I believe the pipes worked find until I had to use my Kicker because the Bike Had Loaded Up Thus, Causing me to clear the chamber which is where the Kicker comes in. Imagine my surprise that the Kicker did not clear lower exhaust pipe and now I have a Serious Scratch in my exhaust pipe due to their incompetence by sending me the wrong Exhaust Pipes or due their Misleading Ad. I would be Very Wary Of This Provider As The Saying Goes If It's Too good To Be True It Probably Is."
3,Poor recording mix,"Love Saint-Saens Symphony #3. This was poorly recorded in terms of the mixdown. When the piano enters it is hardly audible. It sounds like they put it backstage and opened one of the stage doors. I am reviewing the DVD-Audio version of this recording. This is the lesast satisfying recording I have of this symphony and the least enjoyable DVD-A of the few I own. I was looking forward to being immersed in the recording, but the rear speakers add no depth or dimension to the sound. It's hard to understand what the mixdown engineer had in mind. Honestly, it sounds like there was nothing in mind. Maybe the recording was poor right from the start. Too bad. This rates three stars only because it is a fine work of art and not poorly performed. The recording gets one star."
2,whats this song called,"hey all, jus wondering if any of yaz know the title of the song they play in the background when white jus gets off the phone at the train station and the Phalanx Arrive (in the episode Freak Nation)"
5,WOW,"I bought this CD hoping I wouldn't have to skip through a lot of tracks, but this is one CD I probably wouldn't been able to live without.I like every song on this CD except ""Candy"", which I find it to be somewhat too explicit for my tastes. Other than that, this is a must-buy for your CD collection."
2,Not a true soundtrack,"This is just another collection of pop music, labeled as a soundtrack with the pretense of cramming the music into the show. The background music and ambient soundscapes of the show, totally lacking from this album, would surely be more pleasant listening, and if you're looking for the real music of the show, this ""soundtrack"" is sure to leave you cold."
2,At least it came out.,"There was supposed to be an album for ""Popular,"" but the show got cancelled before it could be put out. I can't bring myself to buy it (though it does have the vocal version of Chuck D and Gary G-Wiz's theme, which was only heard in the penultimate episode); had this included some of Joel McNeely's scores for the show, it would have been a different matter. (There is in fact a release of McNeely music, but only a bootleg.)"
5,One of my favorite trumpet recordings,"An all around incredible album. The Hanson Sonata shuld be in every trumpeter's library, and there are few recordings of it available.The other reviewer's confusion about vocals on the Ligeti piece is cleared up in the CD booklet. Trumpeter and pianist both contribute vocal sounds to this fiendishly difficult piece.By the way, many trumpeters have recorded Hindemith and Enesco, but these are among the best available versions of both.Hardenberger is a great musician and is very brave to tackle such usunual pieces as the Schmitt and Ligeti. His live performances are also dazzling, by the way."
4,evil knight on a h orse,The knight can be outfitted in different weapons and sits on an included horse. My grandson enjoyed staging battles between a good knight and this knight. There are small parts that need to be kept away from very young children.
4,Fun toy - cheap holster.,"I purchased this for my 9 year-old daughter who is going to be Padme for Halloween. The gun works great and looks great. The belt fits well, even though she's very slim. The only downside is that the holster came off the belt almost immediately. We tried gluing it back on, but that only lasted about 3 minutes. We finally just tucked the gun into the belt and that works fine."
4,Amazon ROCKS!,"I came across this a couple weeks before Halloween and decided to order it along with several other items to take advantage of the free super-saver shipping and hoped it would make it in time for my daughter to use with her Padme costume. Then I got an email that said, ""We thought you'd like to know that we shipped this portion of your order separately to give you quicker service. You won't be charged any extra shipping fees, and the remainder of your order will follow as soon as those items become available."" We got it in plenty of time for her to play with it AND use it for her costume. She loves it, it works and it looks good. Thanks Amazon for such great service!"
2,"Wrong color, cheap plastic","The color is completely misleading in the photo. The gun is a cheap white plastic with bright orange accents, not the silver and wooden-looking handle that is pictured. I was so disappointed. And as other reviewers have noted, both the belt and gun are not made made and look pretty bad. I would not pay more than $8 for this item and I would recommend looking elsewhere for a better product."
3,As expected,"The product arrived within the time and in the condition i expected. The gun did not work at first, but i open the battery case and adjust it to make it a little tighter which seemed to fix the problem. My daughter will be using this for her padme costume. It runs a little small and there but i will adjust."
1,Blaster didn't work,"Right out of the package, with brand new batteries, the blaster made no response at all. My daughter was very upset at first (part of her Halloween costume). She got over it, but the whole point is to have a blaster that makes the same sounds as in the movies. Which it doesn't."
2,Rubber rubber everywhere,"I bought this for my daughter's Endor Leia Star Wars costume. Let me just say, I was not impressed. The pockets aren't pockets at all, the description was vague about this, but it turns out they are just molded rubber that kind of look like the canvas pockets Amadala had. They are just glued to the belt and have no backing. From a distance they look ok, but up close they have the appearance of a rubber blob. This also ruled out any attempt to change the color to anything but cream. I don't think any die or paint would stick to these. The holster is similar. My daughter is allergic to latex and so we didn't even want to try this belt. The gun looked decent, but you can buy that separate. We returned it to amazon (free luckily, as a prime member.)"
1,Will Not Fit An Adult,"This was the only Padme belt/holster I could find on Amazon and the item is described as fitting ""most adults and big kids"". Yeah, I don't think so buddy. I couldn't even get it around the most slim part of my waist and I am by no means heavy. Padme's belt is meant to be slung around the hips, so there is absolutely *no* chance it would fit an adult properly.It does, however, fit my 5 year old perfectly. Even then, it is incredibly poorly made. The holster is *barely* glued on and the materials are pretty cheap. The velcro is very weak and the belt comes undone easily. Judging from the packaging the item arrived in it is at least several years old.I would return it if I didn't need the blaster for my costume."
5,Made the Costume,"My 2 year old was Padme. We just put her in a white shirt, white leggings, and made her a white cape. We then bought this and it made the costume. It was too big, but I just added some velcro to the bad and it fit perfectly.The blaster takes batteries and makes noise. I have purchased several costumes made by this company and they seem to make good quality items."
4,"Lewd, rude & crude - but FUNNY","This video is a spoof of deer hunting videos featuring naked women as prey. You will not want to watch this with anyone who does not have a ""broad"" sense of humor. The funniest thing is when this was released in the summer of '03, the national news media bought into this obvious hoax with major news organizations interviewing women's right groups in an orgy of righteous indignation. After watching this you will have to admit you'd have to be a few crayons short of a box to believe it was real. It's obvious all of our ""reliable"" news organizations never took the time to actually view the video, instead choosing to spread this comedy as fact in a typical media frenzy. Watch this video at a bachelor party or at a hunting camp and roll on the floor laughing, but remember that the news media took this as fact. You'll never trust the news again!"
4,Does a good job but hard to setup,"If you want razor sharp knife, this jig is a must.2 notes of cautions though1/ It really only works for big knifes.2/ It is hard to setup and the instruction on the DVD are just not enough (at least they were not for me). You can download some instruction from the competition that make an identical Jig. They will show you how to position the knife properly which is not obvious.Once you get use to setup your knifes correctly you can get some really good results in no time."
3,Own the trademarks to two famous horror villians.,"I would recomend this one only to hardcore fans of the film Freddy VS Jason. Both the glove and the mask are attached into this box, but you can get them of by using a screwdriver as long as you're careful. Unlike the hockeymask, Freddy's glove is not wearable wich disapointed me a bit. Also, Jason's mask is missing it's famous axe-mark, but since they forgot it in the movie they problably saw no point in adding it here either."
1,Dissapointed,After receiving the replica all i could think about was how upset i was to have wasted 200 dollars. If i can turn back time i would not order this item. I shelfed it on my entertainment center and so far my friends seem to think its really cool. Maybe one of them wil make me an offer.
3,Good Read,"The book was an exhaustive research on his works, I would have preferred a bit more about what made him as a person and a little more on his hidden life."
2,Not much there,"I'm a yoga teacher, about to teach a prenatal class. I bought this book because Judith Lasater is an excellent teacher and I hoped to get some ideas for my class. The 23 pages of this book devoted to prenatal yoga were quite helpful. I just expected more. This is billed as a Rodmell Press ""Yoga Shorts"" and it is. The book would probably be most helpful for a pregnant woman who is new to yoga. She would learn 6 poses, 3 of them supported. For everyone else, I'd recommend going with Lasater's RELAX AND RENEW."
5,A Great Book!,"If you want insight into the parables of Jesus and how they relate to the events in the last three years of His ministry, this is a MUST read. The impact on your own life will be evident as well. Ellison gets to the heart of Christ's offer of mercy and grace to a lost and searching world.I have used Ellison's outlines of the OT (Knowing God's Word) in my Bible Study for years and have also read ""Who Owns The Land?"" -- one of his monumental books -- more than once. But this book is the best I have ever found by him --Buy several and give them to your friends --"
3,Good winter holster,"I purchased this holster for my Ruger P89 and it is a tight fit. The velcro for the adjustable retention strap adds to the over width of the holster by a noticeable amount. At least with my combination, my Ruger always seems to print unless I'm wearing a jacket. While well made, this holster is not great for year-round carry, at least with a P89 or similar pistol."
3,"Great for cabinets, not for drawers","My daughter loves to play in the bathroom drawers, so we installed these latches. Turns out that the latches are too long. She can still open the drawers wide enough to get her little hands inside. They work great on cabinets, however."
1,There are better choices,"These work, but they are more difficult to use than competitor's. They are wider, so they're sturdier, but it makes it more difficult to push down to get the cabinet/drawer to open. Also, if you have used older versions, the holes to screw these in don't match, either on the latches or the catch. Also, they are so long, little hands can pry the cabinet open far enough to get inside unless you put the catch so far back inside that then it's in the way of whatever you have inside the cabinet. We think the child safety cabinet latch by Prime-Line are a much easier and equally effective solution."
3,"so far, so good",We purchased these--fairly easy to install as long as you have a drill. Keeping baby out so far. Used when tot locks were to hard to locate with magnet-better than them by far.
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT!!!,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but this product is so bad I had to. I just don't want other parents to buy and waste time installing. For the most part, they don't latch at all...and even when they do, they warp in 5-10 openings/closings of a drawer. SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. IT IS JUST A GIANT PIECE OF ____. PLEASE DON'T BUY'EM."
1,Breaks Easily,"We bought this and the first time we tried the opening the drawer these broke. We then replaced them, but just to watch my 16 month toddler to open and break the latch on his first try. Very disappointing. We had to replace all the drawer latches with another brand. Don't waste your time."
1,Terrible,"These are a waste of money. We bought them thinking the adhesives would be good enough for installation and it doesn't even adhere for more than 5 minutes. The latch is long and awkward, so not even sure how it works given the angle when opening the door."
3,"more of a ""college"" book","Enjoyed reading this, but I had been expecting a more ""fun"" read than a college/school type read"
3,Treat us right,"I've been waiting for this to come out for a long time. The music is great, every song...but...even the liner notes confirm that most of the songs that Roy made popular are not on this CD.And the sticker on the front says ""The best of the best"" a bit misleading."
5,Self-contained power supply,"I'm using this to provide the PoE power for my Panasonic BB-HCM735 network camera. So far it's been reliable. The power supply is fully built in to the main unit - it is nice that this does not have a separate bulky power transformer, just a plug-in cord. The green power LED lights up. Straight and simple and it works."
5,Good Little PoE Injector,Works as advertised. No issues.Would be a better product if it had tabs or slots for mounting.
5,A Perfectly Fine POE Injector,"There isn't really much I can say about this little guy. I have it wired into a Mitel IP phone and it has preformed admirably over the past few months since I've purchased it. I haven't done any bandwidth testing, but I've never experienced any issues with my voip connection. Plug and play, although customers who don't have spare ethernet cords on hand (if they exist) may be caught off guard, as none are supplied with the device."
3,Not the best out there...,"Although Robert Shaw may be a big draw to some, unfortunately this Requiem is severely lacking. As a choral singer who has performed the Requiem, I found many of the movements either too fast or slow, and absolutely did not like his Kyrie--WAY too slow!! For the best version I have found, I would direct the discriminating listener to Academy and Chorus of St. Martin in the Fields, with Sir Neville Marriner conducting. But, if you're a Shaw fan, then this is a good CD. But if you're a Requiem fan, go with Marriner absolutely!"
4,Great insight,You can tell a lot about a person by the letters they write. Great insight into a strong leader of the United States.
3,This is my first review,I`m hoobist in 3D Studio max end I wont any lirning. The ols the first time.
4,Don't be fooled - Hervé is NOT the star!,"I will not dispute that Hervé did a great job, his villainous Spider is unbelievably cold, but this movie belongs to its star, Jonathan Frid. He finally gets to step out of the (dark) shadow of Barnabas Collins in this film, and shows his acting chops in a ""mainstream"" role. Christina Pickles plays his wife, a harried woman who turns out to be rather strong in the end, even as Frid's character weakens. I'll warn you, though, the editing in particular is rough unless some of it was recut for this DVD release. I'm thrilled that it's finally going to be available."
2,before they were famous,"this was oliver stone's first film and it isn't too bad. It suffers from a cast whose acting skills are limited. the idea is a pretty good one but the story doesn't effectivly set up the mania the ensues. everyone tries pretty hard and it is always nice to see mary woronov on screen. stone does a good job making it all moody and meancing to the guests who visit jonathon frid and wind up being tormented by creatures from his imagination, But Frid isn't a strong enough lead to make it work. you could do worse"
5,Fantastic Tuner,"This tuner is absolutely fantastic. It does exactly what its supposed to do when you need it to. I have it hooked up to a 30"" CRT HDTV and the TERK HDTVa Indoor Antenna. They are a perfect pair and work great. As for me, unlike the previous reviewer, mine did in fact play burnt DVD's and burnt VCD's. A great product for a great price."
2,Okay,"Pros: Excellent picture quality, easy to use, features and connection optionsCons: Unit freezes up a lot which requires unit to be turned-off to reset, remote needs to be pointed in certain angle for unit to respond, black screen delay of 2-5 seconds when changing channels via over-the-air broadcasts.Since the cons are major issues the unit suffers from, I cannot recommend this unit especially for its hefty price."
2,DVD Disaster,I have had my unit for about 1 1/2 years and the dvd playback is a joke. I am able to clean the heads and get maybe two dvd's to play without hanging. Since I bought this primarily for the dvd upconversion I am sad that the performance is no better than it is. I can not in good conscience recommend this item to anyone. This is my first LG product and looks like it might be my last.
4,Great product - A lot to be desired for the users guide.,"This is a great product and it is very easy to use...however the users guide is not very easy to understand for the not so technical user. I gave this to my son along with the hdtv for his birthday and he was able to understand the guide with no problem. I like simple instructions, though I was able to get the basics which, for me was enough to set it up using an additional antenna."
4,bdashnaw,"My kids love these goggles even though they are blurry to look through. They are only ""focused"" through the very center of the circular areas in the green plastic lens. There is NO clear peripheral vision with these goggles. I was very disappointed by this and would have returned them if my children hadn't objected. I will limit the time they spend wearing them."
1,really a headlamp,My 10 year old thought this was really dumb - how can you really be a spy with lights shinning from the lenses? It's really just a headlamp with green tinted goggles.
1,THE TOY ISN'T REALLY NIGHT VISION GOGGLES!!!...,"The toy may look cool..but it's really not. All it is is a green visor with a light. Your better off buying a flash light then this. Heck even a lamp is better then this. So if your really young and have a ""BIG"" imagination then u would like this toy. But if your not that young and want REAL NIGHT VISION GOGGLES then don't get this. BELIVE ME ITS NOT WORTH IT!!..."
3,Okay for younger kids,I got this for my 6 year old nephew and he thought it was pretty cheesy. My 2 year old thought it was really cool though.
3,Great Idea-Bad Product,"I purchased these for my 6 year old nephew who loved them for the 10 minutes they worked. The new set his parents exchanged them for NEVER worked. It's a shame because he really liked them. I had planned on purchasing these for 3 other nephews for Christmas but with two duds, I'll have to find other alternatives."
3,Fun for a while.,"These are great for little kids and older kids alike but they really are just a green visor with penlights on the sides with a bulky mabob to turn it on and off. If it is on pull up the visor and it turns off or use the switch. I got it as a gift and use it when my little cousins want to play spy or when I want to read after the lights are off. Overall good toy, I reccomend this for ages 3-9."
1,Misleading advertising -- A very poor toy,"This is just awful. The toy does not work -- you can barely even see out of the glasses. You'd be better off using them as a flashlight and taking them off your head.The manufacturer says, 'With a little imagination, these battery-powered goggles--with mini-flashlights flanking the lenses--become real ""see in the dark"" glasses'.Make that ""a lot of imagination"", and they don't ever become ""real"" anything, expect a waste of money."
1,Bad Goggles!!!,"My friend got a pair and I tried them in the Bathroom and I was suprised at how bad they were!You can't really see in the dark it's just two lights!And it's really uncomfortable in the back,I would NOT recommend these to anyone."
1,uncomfortable and worthless,These glasses not only don't light up very much but they are bulky and not comfortable to wear. Neither of my kids like them. I would not recommend them at all.
3,Durable,"I bought my three nephews one each. The 9 year old was the only one who was really into it. The others seemed to be disappointed it was just flashlights on some goggles. When i bought this i expected as much as i expected from a pair of x-ray vision glasses. So if anyone bought this product and was expecting to get night vision goggles they obviously had never ordered x-ray glasses, which are just as falsely advertised. But these are much more durable. My nephew dropped them half a dozen times crawling in the basement and they still work fine."
3,Not as fun as it looks,The battery pack on the back of the glasses is very uncomfortable. My 5 year old will keep it on for about 3 seconds. I am very disappointed with this item.
4,Cool!,"I purchased this toy for my 8 year old son who is really into spying and magic tricks, etc. He thought this was a really cool toy. Although it is not real spy goggles, his imagination went wild. Thanks for helping out a parent who needed a great gift suggestion!"
1,Sorry excuse for a plaything,"This product is a complete waste of money as it serves absolutely no purpose. Sure, it looks as if it will come in handy for reading in the dark or something, but it is truly unenjoyable. Do yourself a favor and stay away."
2,two light bulbs,(...)I got this for my birthday. But it was as boring as a sack of toenail clipings. (...)It is two lightbulbs with two green lenses. You could see in the dark with a flashlight.
1,Don't bother,"We bought 2 of these wonders a few months ago only to return them a few days later. To sum it up - it was the worst purchase we've ever made at Amazon.com, and we buy a lot.First of all, the title and the item description tend to give the impression that you are about to buy some kind of infra-red vision gadget - you're not. All you get is a red plastic visor with 2 little lightbulbs. In fact, you see better at night without the goggles than with that green plastic covering your face. Our older child's vision was in fact impaired to the degree that he actually hit a tree while having this on - he's okay but we did have a little scare at the time.Oh, and one other thing - it's quite difficult for children to keep the visor on their face. Ours kept falling.I gave it 1 star for durability not because it broke while in use but because I would have personally destroyed it if Amazon wasn't so gracious to take it back."
2,Night Vision Goggles,"Yes,after the initial,it's not really night vision and justflashlights. You say ok that is probably why they are so inexpensive. Fun for the kids but they don't stay on the head and my child complains that the battery pack is painful. Also,we have gone through so many batteries that I have banned the toy. It has an on/off switch but when you flip the shades up the light go out so... and they slip back down therefore turning the lights back on and DEAD batteries AGAIN. Good fun but in the long run end up costing more than the original price, with all the batteries,you know."
4,Fun hands free light for night time explorations,"This toy was purchased for our 7 year old triplets (one per child) for their birthday. It's basically a pair of flashlights on a snazzy set of green goggles, and the kids are absolutely wild about them! The goggles fit securely, and comfortably, and the beams of light are easy to direct with the motion of the head. This toy keys into the imagination, and young adventurers are free to investigate the night unhampered by hand held flashlights."
1,Bad Goggles!!,"My friend got a pair and I tried them in the bathroom and I was suprised at how bad they were! You can't really see in the dark it's just two lights! And it's really uncomfortable in the back,I would NOT recommend these to anyone."
4,My daughter loved them,"For [the price] i hope no one expects to get real nightvision goggles.These are a toy and keeping that in mind they are a great purchase.They are a green shaded pair of goggles with a small flashlight on each side.Nothing secret about them,if your wearing them & they are on, you will be seen.But to the child & their imagination,they think they're invisible.So if you have a child who likes to play hide-n-seek,or sneek up on you,or play spy,cave digger,explorer,etc they will like these whether they are boy or girl."
4,Great toy for imaginitive children,"My son got these for his 6th birthday and I'm impressed. Asyou read these reviews, you'll notice quite a bit of polarity in theopinions - either the children love it, or they think it's thestupidest toy they've ever seen....If your child likes to imagine,this is a great toy (my son thinks they're like ""SpacemanSpiff"" goggles - not a bad analogy, for someone with aCalvinesque imagination), otherwise, your child will be bored stiff..."
5,Wonderful well built toy.,"What a wonderful way for young explorers to see what is out and about in the dark, something they would not be able to see normally."
1,This phone sucks,"This phone will not charge well. I used it for 3 days, and I had to keep resetting on the charger all day. Then after 3 days t would not change at all. DON'T BUY IT!"
2,5.8 GHz phone with tin sound and wireless interference,"The headset jack is a great feature when you're on hold, typing or just need your hands free, but the phone itself sounds like a tin can, has useless buttons that are different then any other phone I've owned, and you cannot go more than six yards without feedback from WIFI/another cordless phone. I have had great success with 2.4GHz and the latest 6.0 DECT phones without any interference."
1,Complete and utter Garbage!,"This phone is complete and utter garbage. I bought it at Duane Reade for an overpriced thirty something dollars, because I really needed a phone and couldn't make it to Best Buy. This phone sucks. It sounds like your speaking through a piece of tin. The digital numbers do not show up properly on the screen of the phone, so I have to guess who's calling me. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
2,Not worth the high price.,"Most of this thin book consists of quotations from various letters written by Grubb and his associates. While interesting in that respect, I feel the author failed to bring them all together into a story of the lives and work of these men. I sometimes had the distinct impression that the author does not understand the industry he is writing about. In any case I believe this book is certainly not worth the high price."
2,Disappointing...,"This book had a great start... 1)a city civilization fallen from technology on a distant planet, 2)an unusual social structure derived from Nazi socialism, 3)a threatening alien culture, and 4) religious/political intrigue.With all those ideas to build on, I expected an interesting read. However, the shallow characters and hollow dialogue robbed the plot of its depth. With the dark themes and cold brutality of many of the characters, it was probably a good thing that they weren't developed further. At least when (almost) all the characters die, I didn't really know them enough to care. The ending was a bloodbath that didn't resolve many of the open ends of the plot. I assume that in the next book, more of the ends will be tied up, but I don't care enough about the story or the characters to read it. As a work of literature, the book is consistent with its title - Hope's End. As a story, it falls apart."
1,Gruesome and unrewarding,"...The book has a number of problems in my view. The characters are 2-dimensional and the dialogue is stiff. Vel is NOT a sympathetic character. I admit that I could not find a sympathetic character in the entire book. The vision of the book is very dark. The level of bloodshed is stunning and could only appear reasonable if you spend most of your time playing action computer games. Others have praised the book for its ideas. I was not impressed with the author's creativity--William Blake as dictator for life is all well and good, but I did not find it convincing and Pol Pot's ideas are not uplifting. There are mysterious aliens in the book, but a well-executed plot would have been better. Wading through the text was a gruesome ordeal, and my effort was rewarded by the discovery that this book is the first in a series..."
4,I miss Dr. Phibes...,"Imagine if there was a 3rd movie? Oh well... there isn't. I remember never being able to find this book as a kid, so I got my Dr Phibes fix for $.99.The wonders of the digital age. Interesting writing style, and it was nice to visit with the Dr. again."
5,A must-have for any beginning or intermediate drummer!,"This is a great DVD!This DVD provides a wealth of information on the grooves behind all sorts of popular music and world music too. Igoe is an amazingly talented drummer with a gift for instruction, and this DVD is just the ticket for anyone wanting to learn to play. This video will give you what you need to develop your skills a lot!"
4,Really nice but order 1 size larger,These made a great Christmas gift! The only thing was that they shrunk in the dryer... they still fit my husband but I would have ordered a size larger if I would have known.
2,Just fine.,"No much to say, the product was just fine. I'm not really impressed with the looks or the quality. I can get far better quality from any big chain store."
2,boring,"I picked up this book on a whim because I thought the story looked promising. Boy, was I wrong..! This book was simply boring with cookie cutter characters and plot, I had to skip many pages to get through to the end. Susan Sizemore has written many books which became my all time favorites (Autumn Lord, After the Storm, Wings of the Storm) but this one just didn't do it for me."
4,Enjoyed,"I love vampires and this series stands alone by itself. Sometimes you read the same ole, same ole and it's not the case here. Sizemore does a great job."
1,Disaster of Darkness,"I should've known the large typeface was a bad sign. In this case- a weak storyline and cardboard characters. This novel reads like really bad Buffy the vampire fan fic. I was so disappointed.This novel just didn't have enough description, and relied on pages and pages of cheesy dialog to convey major plot points. I never got a sense that either of the main characters were real people and the vampires seem hokey an ineffecutal. Nothing like some of her other works.1 Star."
4,"Master of Darkness (Primes Series, Book 4)",If you have read the others to the seires you will enjoy this book. I love the fact that these have plenty of detail and leve you trying to solve whats going to happen next. Love it
4,"Not GREAT, But a very good read.","After reading, I BURN FOR YOU, I HUNGAR FOR YOU, AND I THIRST FOR YOU, I couldn't wait to read Master of Darkness. I expected it to be more like the previous three(WHICH I ABSOLUTELY LOVED) and it wasn't. I wanted them to ""BOND"" and it was only hinted at in the last paragraph. Therefore, I was a bit disappointed. However, I still enjoyed the book regardless."
2,What Darkness???,"I fully agree with one other reviewer: cardboard characters all the way around. Not much substance to any of the guys in the book either (well, maybe Joe the werewolf had the most characterization). Too bad. I love good vampire novels but this is the last book for me from this author."
2,50 ways to make mashed potatoes,"This was not the book worth for the money. Some of the recipes were pretty good, but I was expecting different types of potatoes and more unique types of recipes."
5,wonderful for children,"It took my daughter and I a couple weeks to understand what my 2 year old granddaughter continually requested. She implored us to get or turn on the roast beef show ... turns out she meant Ferocious Beast ... We have tried to collect all of them. Now the 7 year old and 2 year are arguing over which one to watch first. They love them. The beast is gentle, Maggie is cute, the stories have lessons; a good, fun time with a lovely story each time. I highly recommend especially if you have child or grandchild afraid of monsters or unseen scary things. Lilli has been terrified about monsters. Now she says they're not really scary. She knows they're like Maggie and the ""roast beef"" and she's not frightened anymore. : )"
3,Okay Drive,If you want a DVD burner that works this one is a good bargain. The light scribe is pretty cool on it. I use mine almost all the time. My sister got the same one as well but her Light scribe stopped working for some reason. She can print letters but no pictures. If you are looking for something that is quiet don't get this drive it sounds like it's going to take off with your computer attached to it. It's very loud and noisy. Other than that it's works fine for recording and backing up.
1,Loudest Drive Ever!!!,Bought three of these drives bc I and my two sisters needed new DVD Burners. It seemed like a good bargain.It is THE LOUDEST DRIVE I have ever heard! It's ridiculous. I don't even understand how a drive could be this loud. Seriously. And it's that way for all three of them. Do NOT buy this drive.Ugh.
1,did not receive item I purchased,"I purchased two Liteon Dvd double layer 20x lite scribe recorders, but was shipped two phillips ones instead. Both work the same and I am satisfied with the phillips so I won't send them back. Next time, send what is listed."
4,Comfort ye my people who own expensive stereo equipment.,"A light, chamber performance of the perennial Handel classic.Shaw and Co. are in fine form here, with outstanding soloists and Shaw's trademark choral precision.The sound may be an issue for some listeners though:Telarc's unique recordings were produced without compression or equalization, sometimes resulting in a very bass-heavy and cavernous sound quality on lower-end sound equipment (including IPods).For listeners with very high-end sound systems, this is probably the preferred recording. The full dynamic range will come through nicely, and the volume can be elevated for a true concert hall experience.For listeners with Ipods or less expensive stereo systems, I would recommend the Trevor Pinnock version, or the fine Colin Davis vintage recording."
5,Great cd!,The cd came in great condition. This one of the best Handel Messiah I have heard. I very much recommend it!
4,Shaw's echoing 1984 Messiah,"Handel's MessiahRobert ShawAtlanta Symphony Orchestra & Chamber ChorusI agree with a previous reviewer who said that this sounds as if it were recorded in a cave, but it is nevertheless a good version of the piece. Four Stars"
3,Broken case,"The case was cracked when received. I don't want to take the time to return it, so it'll be fine. Hopefully recording will be good quality."
2,Doesn't do anything for me.,"I have great respect for Robert Shaw, and this isn't a bad recording. I just find nothing in it that I'd want to come back to. Too large, diffuse, uninspired.His 1966 Messiah is another matter. Some of those choruses are staggering! I wish he had built on that here, but he seems to have gone off the track.For those who like this one, I recommend either of the Colin Davis recordings, either of the Marriner recordings, and above all, Westenberg."
4,Perfectly adequate recording,"This was one of the very first CD's I ever purchased of anything - bought back in the early '90's. I have listened to it hundreds of times and have not become tired of it. There may be better recordings out there but I have never felt the need to replace it - it is still my only Messiah CD.My only criticism is that the timing seems a little rushed, especially the track, ""Since By Man Came Death"". Other than that nothing is left out (this is not a ""highlights"" CD) and the music is as powerful and uplifting as you would expect the Messiah to be.Also a good booklet with the CD with extensive historical notes (English only), all the lyrics and short bio's of the five soloists.Overall I don't think you will be disappointed with this CD unless you are a music expert who can detect the minor flaws that exist in most everything recorded."
4,If you want a Choral piece done right have Shaw do it,"An excellent recording of the Messiah. The choruses are flawless with perfect rhythm, probably the best renderings of the Messiah choruses I've ever heard including live performances by Boston's Handel and Hayden Society. Soloists are also very good though balance between them and orchestra could be better at points. In particular, the orchestra tends to cover the pianissamo passages of soprano airs (e.g. opening of I Know that My Redeemer Liveth although this may be a limitation of my relatively old equipment). One performance oddity is thae some aria that are often sung by Tenor are sung by Soprano here which I found slightly odd when I first listened to this CD. Over time I have warmed to aspect of this recording."
2,Too boring,Each time when I listened to this recording I almost felt asleep. The voices of the soloists went deeper and deeper most of the time and it's likely that they were not singing Handel's Messiah but Bach's St. Matthew Passion. Better performances from Davis/London Symphony (Philips) and Solti/Chicago Symphony (DECCA) can be found at this site. The orchestration is kind of too powerful in Beecham/Royal Philharmonic's (BMG/RCA) and Ormandy/Philadelphia's (Columbia/Sony) versions. The best Messiah I've ever heard was recorded by Davis/Bavarian Radio Symphony (Philips).
3,Iron Tek Essential Liquid Amino complex,"This product is ok. It tastes very bitter, but I put in into a tart cranberry juice. I have taking it for a month. I expected a rush of energy, so far that has not happened. Perhaps it will take a bit longer. I like the auto- order program. It is very easy to edit and change delivery times."
5,A Page Out Of History,"I served as Chief of Security for Air America in Thailand and Vietnam from 1967-1975. I enjoyed ""Mule's"" book very much. For those who shared Jim Parker's experiences you will relive old memories. For those who could not be there you will find the details fascinating. I would encourage you to read this one."
5,Great Book,"This is a very well written account of CIA ops. Not only about the fighting, but also the human side of the ""secret"" war in Laos."
4,Covert Ops: The Cia's Secret War in Laos,"An exceptional account of our secret war in Loas, pulling no punches in detailing both the bravery of many men as well as the stupidity of others. All of this woven in with a warm picture of the author's family life. In reading the book one concludes that it is an honest and straight forward account of the way our war in Loas was fought, without trying to make heros of the men who were truely the heros, nor overly critizing those who were more of a hinderance than help. In short, a clear, concise and well written account. Highly Recommeded by this reader."
1,Covert Ops,"This book was full of non essential waffle, puff to probably pump up the pagenumbers to get a book out of some overview of the authors time in country.Compared to books like the Ravens or Chicken hawk. I would use this one fora door stop.Regards"
4,Could'nt put it down,It was an exxelent book i mean it starts to get boring when he has an indoor job but about half way into the book it was really good. i recommend this book to anybody
2,Good but out of date,"Well-written, clear, a helpful overview. However, it does not take into account the 2005 public offering reforms, so its treatment of permissible communications during the offering process (about 30% of the material in my Sec Reg I course) is totally unhelpful and misleading. As of this writing, I'm not aware of any more up-to-date study guide/outline on this subject."
4,Another Well Written Book,"Securities Regulations: Examples And Explanations, seems to be a good choice for law students taking a course on securities law. The book's presentation is logical and well thought out.Another book worth considering is:Securities Regulations in a Nutshell,"
1,Horrible,This book is about rape not romance. I feel compelled to review it because I have never been so disgusted by a romance novel in my life.
3,"Puts the ""chrome"" in chromatic","This is a very skilled and technically accurate recording of the 6th symphony. Imagine setting the score in front of an orchestra made up entirely of robots, and getting the kind of tight, polished performance you would expect. But this is the last thing we want with Tchaikovsky. Let's face it, one of the things we love most about him is that he was something of a drama queen. Usually the Pathetique runs the emotional gamut with all its rapture, rage and despair, but this time--not really. One of my favorite recordings is James Levine's, which was also done in the 80's, but unfortunately it isn't as readily available."
3,The same information could be given in much less space.,"The first few chapters are marred by religious intolerance. Mr Dalrymple portrays christians as an impediment to the advancement of science while ignoring the contributions of such noted christian scientists as Kepler, Mendel and Newton. He appears to see all christians as young earthers and promotes the myth that the bible teaches that the earth is six thousand years old, a view which is bad theology as well as bad science. Chapter three and chapter eight are well worth the read. The rest of the book could easily have been condensed into half its length. Chapter four was particularly agonizing. I gave the book a three because it does contain some interesting and useful information."
1,Rosy Mis-Portrayal of Isotopic Dating,"Dalrymple does an excellent job of presenting isotopic dating as factual. In particular, he would have us believe that dating results converge on 4.5 billion years. In doing so, he conveniently ignores large numbers of contradictory dates, and numerous other serious problems with isotopic dating. Dalrymple's work will prove convincing only to those who have not read the relevant geologic literature for themselves and/or who are already predisposed to believing that the earth is very old."
2,ABBA in the Beginning,"If you love ABBA for ballads like ""Name of the Game"" or ""Knowing Me Knowing You"" or Pop gems like ""Take a Chance On Me"" DONT buy this CD - you will be shocked at how dull ABBA was in the beginning before they hit Eurovision gold with ""Waterloo"".Sometimes they sound like a bad Hootenanny act. Many of thier early recordings are folk-based. The melodies are great, but the lyrics are just terrible and amaturish. I reccomend searching for a used copy of the original 1976 ""Greatest Hits"" LP or the CD that was issued in the late 80's by Atlantic. It featured the best tracks from this album."
2,"Abba, Before the Rise","""Ring Ring"" is the first album that Abba ever recorded, and it shows an band that was just beginning to figure out how to write great pop songs. There are a couple of hits and a whole lot of misses included. The title track was their first hit single, and it started them on their meteoric rise to becoming one of the biggest bands in the world during the 1970s. The second song is ""Another Town, Another Train,"" which is nearly as good as ""Ring Ring,"" though not nearly as popular. From there, things are pretty mediocre. The typical Abba formula of great hooks and simple melodies is largely absent. Moreover, Benny and Bjorn (the male members) are the featured lead vocalists on about half of the tracks. As the band hit its stride later on, B&B (wisely) retreated to the vocal background and let Angelica and Anna strut their stuff.Overall, this is easily the worst of Abba's original albums. The band recorded plecnty of exellent music, but little of it is featured here."
3,the first...not necessarily their best...,"at the time of its (original) release, this album provided no clues to the 300 million records they would eventually tuck under their belts (and bank accounts) 29 years after.""ring ring"" however shows their still-being-nurtured grasp of the english pop idiom. the same cannot be said of their production techniques - phil spector's legendary ""wall of sound"" and the beach boy-esque vocal harmonies make for a very interesting mix.the title track is the first and last song to be co-written by persons outside the group (phil cody and neil sedaka). judging by the staggering success they'd achieve in the following 8 years, it seems they didn't have to get outside help in the first place."
4,Neat game... but there is room for improvement.,"This game is something my 5-year-old son REALLY wanted for Christmas; lo and behold--Santa brought it! It was surprisingly easy to set up, and the game itself is simple enough for a kindergartner to understand. It is overall a really cool game to look at and to play...However...The magnet mechanism seems to be somewhat flawed because when you swing Spiderman, instead of ""pointing"" to a villain as he's supposed to, 9 times out of 10 swings he lands in the middle. The directions tell you that when that happens the player should simply swing him again...We are spending a heck of a lot of time swinging again! Also, the buildings on the board make for a really fun and interesting scene for Spiderman, but it's a little difficult to maneuver around them. Also, the ""buildings"" don't stay in place very well. I think we can overcome the flaws (reinvent the playing directions), and I would still reccommend the game--just don't expect perfection."
2,Product description Addendum,"When I play paintball, I am one of the unfortunate individuals that radiates humidity. I've upgraded my Proto mask with a thermal lens only to find it is not 100% effective. With some sprinting and heavy panting, the lens fogs over. I wanted to try my luck at adding this turbine fan. The Product description states ""With 2-speed operation, you'll never have to lose your focus again"". This turbine does NOT come with 2 speeds, unless you consider off as a speed. And lose focus? Have you heard the thing? Probably not if you are looking here to buy. It needs some vibration dampening, since there is no variable speed, the motor runs at a high RPM and runs loud. Maybe I was unlucky and got a fan where the motor doesn't seat properly in the plastic housing, I don't know. I haven't yet had the pleasure of using this fan yet, I intend to this weekend. I just hope I am caught in a swarm of hornets to disguise the loud buzzing."
4,Great Storytelling,"""Almost a Mensch"" is a fascinating book about the challenges of a young Jewish boy growing up in the United States at a time where the world, as we know it today, was taking shape. Dr. Gotlieb is a great storyteller. He captures your attention all the way to the end of his book. He paints a good picture of the social environment in this country during WWII and methodically describes the infrastructure created by the Jewish people during that time to build their homeland. I found this illuminating.I was emotionally stirred when Dr. Gotlieb was describing the perils he faced during his voyage to Haifa and the tragedies the European Jews encountered during and after World War II. I cannot help but reflect on today's events in the Middle East, recognizing that we still have not accomplished what those people were looking for ""a safe and secure homeland""."
1,Don't blindly believe what you read,"Mr. Gagnon is no stranger to the liberal theologian community in that he works hard in researching every point he can squeeze out of the bible to establish a premise that homosexuality (and homosexual people)are evil and deserving of punishment. What he fails to consider is that times have evolved and more scientific research is out there proving the naturality of homosexuality inherent in the Creator's natural work. As a rationalist and a believer I do not blindly follow what is written in the bible without actually looking and expereiencing what is truly out there- that Homosexual people are not aberrations or deviations from the natural order but are merely natural variatons of God's diverse created order. Those who want to believe deeply in their hearts the concept of ""evil homosexual people"" are those who fail to comprehend the most basic message of Christ's Gospel- unconditional love, acceptance and inclusion."
5,Italian words for Italian food,"Italy has a lot of variety in its regional cuisines and language dialects. And that affects the design of this guide.There's an 85-page menu primer of food terms used in Italian restaurants, pretty much all over Italy. There's also a short section on comfort foods and another on beverages. And there's a special 96-page section of words describing regional and seasonal food specialties.Take this guide with you and eat well!"
3,Its a great product would not work for few older people,"I am using this for the last 3 years. Its a great product and works well for employees with normal skin. It would not work for some employees with thick, wrinkled or chapped fingers."
1,junk,"We are currently using this product. I would not reccomend this product at all. It was great when it was working well, but 85% of the time it is down and we have to resort back to using paper again. The support that you receive with this is limited and when your support time is over it is $50.00/hr. to get more help on their product. Our ongoing issues with this have led us to purchase something else and throw that thing away. I would steer clear of this trap."
1,Not worth the box it is shipped in.,"This is a generic ""how to feed your puppy"" book with a couple of pictures of GSP's and one extra chapter devoted to the breed. If you don't already know the information contained in the book, you have never owned a dog in your life. Spend the extra cash on ""New Complete GSP's"" or ""GSP's Today"""
5,Great Toy,"I LOVE THIS TOY!!!! This toy is supposed to be a Christmas gift for my four-year old niece. The problem is my four-year old son and I like it so much, we want to keep it. The house is not difficult to put together and you cannot beat Playmobil quality. This toy has made me a Playmobil Fan."
2,Too Complicated!,"I was so excited to get this video, only to be completely let down. Instructors went through moved very quickly and advanced on before I could figure out the initial moves. It became impossible to follow, and I eventually turned it off. One would have to watch the video multiple times beforehand or know all moves from a more advanced level to be able to participate."
2,Toning section is great,"i agree with the others. the toning section of this video is awesome but the aerobic part is to ""fancy"". the instructors are moving and changing so quickly i found it hard to keep up with. i found myself going back to the basic step continually. i think the instructors could have been more serious. i don't recommend this video to anyone who isn't professional jazz dancer. lol"
1,on and on,More about the author than Hitler. Was hoping to learn more about what Hitler was really like and what it was like living in Germany during Hitler's regime.
3,Carlos Anyone?,"I won't insult the other folks who think Mr. Dorsey invented electronic interpretations of Bach music, but I feel compelled to insert here that Wendy Carlos pretty well covered this 40 years ago, and very,very well. The technology back then was much more cumbersome to achieve results too, but Carlos brought all the glory and genius of Bach to the least and most expensive sound systems. Carlos's use of the stereo field was also much more imaginative (if not a little over the top). Dorsey isn't bad, but his versions seem to lack the personality we get from the Carlos body of work when it comes to Bach. There seems to be a lack of expression, or maybe it just sounds too ""robotic"". I've used a lot of the ""modern"" technology in sythesizer / sequencer workstations available for the last two decades, and let me tell you, it IS very difficult to NOT sound robotic. But, to each his own. Kudos to Dorsey for his attempts."
3,so so,its about the lucchese mob in new jersey; about that court case when DiNorscio represented himself. i picked it up in a drug store so i knew it wasn't gonna be a great mafia classic but if you're into mafia books
3,"More Holy, Less Hilarity",You can read my review of the first book in the series and apply it here. More of the same oft-told stories without trying anything new. I will stick to the Church Chuckles series instead.
2,Great Technician Not Great Music,Love a good slide guitar. This is a good player. After 5 minutes it just sounds like variations of the same lick over and over and over again. I would like to hear him play with others. Not enough on his own.
5,Simply THE BEST,"Roy is definitely the best guitarist the ""mainstream"" public has never heard of. I first was turned on to him when he played slide on Sammy Hagar's ""Little White Lies"" song. I then went searching for cd's by him and now have the Roy collection. If you are in the mood for a GREAT collection of songs and some blistering guitar playing then this is the cd for you."
2,"Artificial, Disappointing","Like others here, I ordered this CD after hearing the artist on NPR. He has chops but to paraphrase Albert King's complaint about other players, he ""just plays fast, ain't got no soul."" I don't hear it, anyway. The tracks are mildly entertaining but there's nothing moving or particularly rewarding, much less memorable. ""Uninspiring"" and ""two-dimensional"" are references that come to mind. I deleted it from my iPod after just a listening or two."
5,Yum.,"I can't stop munching on this cornbread. While the jalapeno could be more pronounced, it is present. The texture is crisp, moist and soft all at the same time. I love it! Bakes up perfectly if you follow the package directions."
2,Disappointing,"I love Hodgson's bread mixes for the bread machine and keep almost every flavor on Subscribe and Save so I'm never without. When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it. The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent, the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy. Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread, even those made gluten free or wheat based. This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil. The second try I used butter, but achieved the same results. Because I figured it was Hodgson's and it would be great, I ordered a case of 6 boxes. Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen. I just did not like the flavor, texture, appearance or indescribable after-taste. I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it."
1,Sounds good -- tastes yucky,"Don't even try this one. It's the only Hodgson Mill mix I've tried, I didn't like. The others are delicious!"
1,Terrible,"Just bought a 6-pack of this cornbread and it is absolutely terrible. We're throwing away the remaining five boxes and the entire pan we cooked up. Beyond the immediate taste of bitterness -- it has no zing of jalapeno, no salt, no flavor whatsoever. It leaves an awful sour taste in your mouth!It doesn't hang together when cut but collapses into a pile of crumbs.What a waste of $12, eggs, milk & vegetable oil."
4,Not Bad,"Having lived in the deep South for eight years, I know cornbread. This stuff isn't sweet, has a slight bite due to the jalapeno, and is pretty tasty. You do need milk and an egg, and I was searching for box breads that only needed water ( single guy ), but it is worth the price."
5,The ending leaves you angry. Will there be another book?,"Good book. However, the ending makes you angry because you want the story to continue so we can learn which baby she had and how the other women dealt with their own child."
2,The Clinic is not like any other book I have read.,"This book was about an average book. It was kind of hard to get into. The complications in the book were very unusual. It was also kind of jumpy. If you choose to read this book, you better have a very open mind and be able to understand what it is like to have a child. It tells a lot about the troubles and frustrations of not being able to have a kid. If I had a choice, I probably would not have finished this book. I like to read books that move faster than this one did. It gets slow in the middle, and the complications seem to be similar. This is not a book for everyone."
2,Thriller with Hidden Agenda,"While The Clinic follows the pattern of many medical thrillers, patient seeking extraordinary help becomes trapped in villain's unethical experiment/treatment, Langello's focus seems to push a hidden agenda. I found the main character to be somewhat one dimensional and was deeply disturbed by what I perceived to be a strongly ""pro-life"" bias. The heroine seems to be being portrayed as deserving her current state of infertility as punishment for an abortion that she underwent years earlier. I felt that one reason she never came to life was due to the dislike that Langello had for her because of her earlier decision. The action was well done, but the characters were generally unsympathetic."
4,Great Book!,"I found this book refreshing and a very good read. Unlike one reviewer who was ""disturbed"" by the ""pro-life"" bias, I found that a courageous and refreshing change from the usual PC standard, knee jerk, pro-abortion characters in most medical thrillers-and novels in general. I will read this author again!"
4,Rachmaninoff 2nd symphony,"Music was wonderful, but jewel case was smashed when it arrived. I was disappointed with this."
1,A bloody cross between Commando and Air Force One,"A beauty contest runs amuck with terrorists who want diamonds from a rich (corrupt) senator. Aside from the high body count, the shootings and so forth are quite graphic. The good guys do win but their numbers are seriously depleted. Strangely, despite the R rating the language and sex are quite restrained."
3,Shannons best movie,"I've seen many of shannon tweeds movies and this one in my opionion is the best. It has a good cast as well as action. Robert Davi and Andrew Dice Clay play their roles well. Clay as a disgruntled ex-mercenary betrayed, by a crooked drug running senator, decides to take hostage a miss galaxy pageant in which the senator's daughter is a contestant. Shannon tweed plays Sharon Bell a former winner and now action star who use's her beauty and karate talents to dispatch the bad guy's. While most of her action scenes are clearly done by a stunt double, the acting is for the most good, and the movie doesn't come off as exploitive which is unusual for a B movie. Overall a good production that keeps the action going at a steady pace. If you are a Shannon Tweeds fan this movie is a must!!"
1,what happened?,"...lets recap this movie: beauty contest, terrorist, barbie turns in to rambo, some people die, bad dialog, and the one thing that could have saved this movie, didnt happen...this is a Shannon Tweed movie, about a bueaty contest, and there is never any sence at all with anyone wearing less than a bathing suitat least that would have made this ok to watch ""late-night"""
4,pretty good,"I think this movie was pretty good. It kind of reminded me of Boys don't cry. Its about a girl who flees Iran, for her love of another woman, and if she returns she is executed. She goes to Germany disguised as a man, and falls in love with a girl. The girl finds out shes a girl and still loves her but the girls ex- husband is upset. I wont tell you more, but the ending kind of leaves you hanging. There is an okay love-making scence. I would reconmend it!"
5,"The Best Performance,Best Recording to date","This is one of the Best Performances of the Requiem I've heard to date.I wish I could have heard Miss Auger perform in person before she died,she simply had an angelic voice.The diction of the chorus wasn't captured very well,especially for German ,I hope Telarc has improved since the 80's on this one,but I have never heard better Orchestral balance than this,and the Organ underpinning on the first,and second movements is AWESOME,and the Fugue in the Third and Sixth movements is unserpassed by any recording I know of,you better have good SUBS for this one!!"
3,"Excellent performance, abysmal recording","Telarc should have known better. A magnificent performance by Robert Shaw's choir is badly marred by the muddy acoustics of the performance chamber. This is one of the most frustrating recordings I own -- I love the singing and interpretation, but I can hardly stand to listen to it. It sounds like it was recorded by wrapping the mics in quilts and sticking them into the air vents at the back of the hall. Very few directors achieve the fine blend of voice and instruments that Shaw demonstrates so well here... but the achievement is largely wasted, rendered irrelevant by the unsuitable performance hall. [Other Telarc/Shaw/Atlanta recordings, not staged in the Atlanta hall, are sparkling and vital; none of the Atlanta recordings share that spark.]"
5,A good memorial of a great choral master,"In March, 1997, I happened to see an ad in Atlanta for a concert by Atlanta Sym. Orch. with Robert Shaw. The main program was German Requiem by Brahms. I immediately visited Arts Center in Atlanta, and I enjoyed the concert. The peformance was so great, and it was much better than my expectation. In the souvenir shop of the hall, I bought the CD. The CD was made many years ago, and I think the CD does not attain the performance level that I listened to in Atlanta in 1997. Nonetheless, we can find high quality of chorus and good beauty of the masterwork by Brahms. I am waitiing for the live recording of the work in 1997!!"
1,BAD EXPERIENCE!! :(,"So unhappy with these people.. The originally send me the WRONG item, tried calling and emailing them and didn't hear back until like a week later or so. (via email) After receiving the wrong item, I immediately send it back and asked to get my return shipping refunded for $4.90.. /sigh I've still not received it yet. When they finally did contact me, they of course apologized for the mix-up and told me to keep the wrong item that was sent to me. This is after I had already sent it back mind you. I told them I no longer had it and wasnt looking into getting anything for free. ALL I wanted was my correct item and to be refunded for the return shipping.Still waiting... and waiting(one month ago)"
2,Lacking in rules explanation,"I bought this game for lonely evenings with my GF. We are both 26 and we play lots of card games and more.The rules are very, very poorly explained and after playing the game twice, we are not even sure we got everything right. The rules definitely lack in examples and visual details.Definitely do not recommend the game, mine will end up in a yard sale this coming spring. Could be good for family-oriented customers, but does not provide any excitement for ""young adults""Alain"
4,Good brain-stimulating game,"If you read the game's instructions carefully and follow them exactly, you'll have a great strategic and mind-stimulating fun time. This game really makes you think and use your brain. I also love the cool ambigram on the box!"
2,Junk,"I bought three of these on September 25th and proceeded to install them on October 5th into one ceiling fixture. One of them just died today, January 7th. I'll report back here on the status of the other two but, based on my experience with other GE Reveal bulbs, the prognosis is not good. Incidentally, I had some generic and much-cheaper halogen bulbs in this fixture for a solid 1.5 years before replacing with the Reveal bulbs. And they were still going strong -- I replaced them because I wanted the natural spectrum lighting, not because they'd gone out."
2,Problematic Bulb and Fixture,Our home has several fixtures which use these bulbs. One bulb is really loud and buzzy. The recessed fixture in which it is installed made it very difficult to change. GE should go back to the drawing board and come up with something that is more user-friendly (how about a standard screw-in type bulb?). I can't recommend this proprietary approach.
4,excellent,It was perfect for a gift. my granddaughter love it.look better in a gift box. especially in christmas and birthdays
4,Count on conair,Great value and expected quality for this product for this basic brush set. If you are familiar with the conair name you can feel confident buying this product.
3,Defective out of the package,Noisy at first plug-in (I did double check to make sure it was not my amp or pickups and the problem was in fact the cable.) I still rate this three stars because Monster does offer a warranty to replace it and this is the only time one of their products has failed on me.
2,"Entertaining effects, there are better learning resources","Kind of fun, wacky ideas, but they are mainly recipes for doing the same thing as the author did. I prefer more emphasis on techniques such as in Scott Kelby's Photoshop CS books or Huggins and Probert's ""Surreal Digital Photography"". That allows me to use my own imagination better."
4,"Clearly written, but didn't reveal all.","This book is a very fascinating read for an ameture photoshop user. The techniques explained in this book are more for a person who wants to make ""modern"" art. The tutorials are clearly written and understandable.The only disappointing thing was that the author didn't show how to do all of the pictures presented in the book."
3,What You Can Do With Photos,"I only checked out this book because the official Weird Al website told me about it and the funny altered photographs of Weird Al it contained but there's more to this great book than just a laugh for Weird Al fans. There's altered road signs, wildlife, famous historic paintings, food and a heap of other stuff. There is also an explanation in the form of a step by step do it yourself guide along with original images showing how every altered photo in this book was done. If you've got Photoshop this is an excellent helpful instruction book. If you don't this book is still enjoyable. It's like funny e-mail photographs people send as attachments all in the one hard copy book. Very impressive!"
1,FLAT AS A PANCAKE,"IF YOU THINK THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU A BETTER PHOTOSHOP ARTIST YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN. THE AUTHOR IS IN DANGER OF BREAKING HIS OWN ARM TRYING TO PAT HIMSELF ON THE BACK. THE BOOK TELLS HOW HE CREATED THE PICTURES SHOWN INSIDE AND VERY LITTLE ELSE. IF YOU LIKE THE PICTURES YOU'LL GET YOUR FUNNY BONE TICKLED BUT IF YOU DON'T CARE FOR WHAT YOU SEE, YOU WON'T CARE HOW HE DID IT. EITHER WAY YOU WILL LEARN VERY LITTLE FROM THIS BOOK."
4,Very nice art work.,"Some of the best art work that I've seen has come from this book. AD&D has has some of the most spellbinding pictures imaginable, and to see it all in one book is a very pleasing thing..."
4,"Inventive, Original and Inspiring","I have enjoyed Rod's writing in the Corner on the National Review website, and have been eagerly awaiting this book. It does not disappoint. Rod is an insightful, careful analyst of modern American life, and he has written an engaging and thoughtful approach to reconciling some of the excess of modernity with the true ""conservativism"" of his intellectual forebears.Compared to what passes for popular right-wing non-fiction, the Malkins, Coulters, Savage, and Hannity quick-hit books that are designed to pummel the other side and make the reader feel good and reinforce their world-view, this is about as different a book as you can get -- an earnest, honest approach to orienting one's life in a way that is faithful to one's values and traditions. Rod is hosting a lively discussion of his book on the Corner, and I urge those who have read this to get over there and join the discussion."
2,Very disappointed,"When I first heard of Rod Dreher through a blog I was astounded that someone had the same thoughts that I did; his Manifesto, sounded like something directly from my journal. Needless to say I waited by the door until the mailman delivered ""Crunchy Cons"". Once I received it I started my devour of it. To my discord Rod Dreher's call back to the Christian faith was not what I expected. I expected to find Biblical reference and a strong faith not quotes from Karl Marx or ideologies from the sixties, peace love a joy movement.Now, please do not think I'm bashing the man because I'm not. Dreher's philosophy is well thought out (logical), well researched (conservations with several other like minded individuals) and he did make some good points (home schooling). His ""Philosophy"" is not for me! Please, don't let me discourage you from reading it!"
1,discusted customer,"If you are a parent reading this review i would think twice before purchasing this for your child. Fist of all, look at it the dolls are referring to gangster related things; There is even graffiti printed on the back of the box.It is not educational one bit. Sure this toy is durable and will last a long time, but think do you want your child playing with a gang dressed doll and be incouraged to copy their gangster reffrences. -signed discusted!!!"
1,Nobody edited this book,"There are so many mistakes in this book, average 1 per page in the math formulas, in the answer pages. Things don't match up. Did anyone bother editing this book? I can't believe thenumber of mistakes."
2,Not all that great. Too broad.,"First of all, I can't believe how stupid my fellow peers are. This is NOT the place to comment about your seller. Can't you read? Some of you are going to be future pharmacists? Hope you aren't practicing in my state.That being said, I was disappointed in the book. I felt that my professor covered subjects more adequately than this book did. It was simplified and, like another reviewer mentioned, all over the place. My professor did admit that it wasn't the best book out there for biopharmaceutics, but it was decent. It's simplified, so it will probably help you get started with your studies. You do want supplemental reading though if your professor isn't that great. (Thankfully mine was.)"
5,educational book,i had to buy this book for a class. it's a difficult class to understand but the book offered plenty of examples to practice from
1,AWFUL,This book took over 3 weeks to get to me. I did not have it for school and missed assignments because of it. I was VERY disappointed in AMAZON.
5,"""for what its worth"".............a vintage perspective...and a fine movie","paranoia strikes deep...and it was real......along the way i read about abbie and his cohorts in the papers and watched on t.v. and later read the books....including the surprisingly wonderful ""letters from the underground,"" and now i've seen this special movie of a time and a man mostly misunderstood by the artful dissemination of misinformation.....i can't imagine this story being better portrayed as a tinsel town product...great casting and production...great feel for the times and the dynamics of abbie and anita....excellent use of actual footage and recreations....for some i might suggest watching the interviews with the cast and actual subjects in the movie...especially tom hayden and anita hoffman....before watching the movie..maybe not though...i watched the interviews last and they made a very good movie a very special event.......watch this movie and it will steal your attention and rally your emotions"
4,Very Good Film,"Steal This Movie invites a new generation to appreciate the contribution of Abbie Hoffman to recent history. All of the performances are memorable, but Vincent D'Onofrio in particular nails his portrayal of the multi-faceted Hoffman. This is a very good film."
3,I'm saving 5 stars for DESIRE!!,"Vinny was great as Abby...the movie itself was o.k....like I said before....VD saves many of these.... if you want bigger reviews, read the others....mine are quick....worth seeing of course."
3,Its ok.,"You know I own every single ABBA album, and I look back and think of all the money I spent and was it worth it? I used to be a huge fan, but ........ I started liking Green Day and....Well now I have eveyone of their albums. If you like ABBA I geuss its a good record.Review by Michal Peters. Please let me know if this review was helpful so I can write better in the future. Thanks for reading."
4,The arrival.,"With their fourth LP ""Arrival"", ABBA finally conquered the U.S. market. ""Dancing Queen"" was their one and only U.S. #1 single, and the album was one of their better sellers on this side of the Atlantic. ""Arrival"" is a first-rate pop music album, and was the group's best-produced album up to that time. The sound quality, although a bit darker than previous albums, showcases the group's sophistication and Euro-glamour while still being radio-friendly. The new remastered edition also includes ""Fernando"" and ""Happy Hawaii""."
5,Return policy,Unfortunately my computer was not equipped from a Video Card standpoint to handle the loading of the game. The seller was extremely responsive with ideas of how to get the product load but I was ultimately unsuccessful. The seller very promptly refunded the purchase with no questions asked and even offered a little buyer incentive because of my trouble. A good company to work with.
1,Pure Hippy Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie is a piece of crap from beginning to about 20 - 25min away from the end. The scenes, characterization and script/dialogue are just complete nonsense. I can't follow the movie. I just don't get it. Thank god these creeps don't run world because... man we would be in a pile s___ right now.. hey.. maybe they do. ???And then there's Jimi. Jimi, unfortunately, was caught on tape saying something..who knows what.. but his guitar was the message. There are snippets of electric guitar phrasing and technique here that are unrivalled anywhere by anyone in the last 50 years. Apart from classic guitar interpretation of the classics, Jimi translates magic through the stratocaster, which tingles the spine, and is virtually unreplicable. Somehow he pierces through discordant chord combinations and crafts sounds and melody, are frankly haunting..............."
3,Full Live footage,I have a VHS of jimi's Rainbow Bridge but the stage footage is only 18 minutes if this DVD contains a full live same it is in woodstock then pls. reply me so I can order it.
3,Out of Control but Honest Period Piece,"This is not a Jimi Hendrix movie - it's a documentary/documentary-style feature about the glory days (?) of the drop-out counter-culture centered here on a Hawaiian retreat/Meditation place/something which is visited by a hippie-establishment liasion Pat Hartley (lookin' groovy in tight jeans) and later by Mr. Jimi Hendrix.It's a long, long wait for the Hendrix performance, which is definitely worth waiting for. It's a well-presented segment which captures the feeling of the times.This movie remains one of my favorite ""Oddballs"". I do not agree that it is a typical mindless pitch to a new demographic. It is a genuinely mysterious and engrossing enterprise for me in that I still cannot determine if that place is real and if the supporting cast is comprised of real actors.Several books on Hendrix have very sketchy details on this film."
4,Great time on DVD,"I was very interesting to look inside 60th with drugs, sex and music. It was the time when was born geniuses of rock-music. Amazing time. And Jimi Hendrix was the main core of this time I mean."
3,Great Music-Terrible Movie,"Buy this only for the sound track and the onstage performance by Jimi, Mitch and Billy. Luckily there is a menu to go right to the songs and miss all the hippy nonsense."
1,WORST DVD EVER!!!!!!,"do not buy this dvd, it has little or nothing to do with jimi hendrix. it says he plays on a volcano in hawaii, but its more like a feild. unless you a hippy, out of your mind on drugs, this movie wont appeal to you. it makes no sense, has no story line, and hardly any jimi hendrix footage. do your self a favor and buy a different hendrix dvd like live at berkely or experience hendrix. it conclusion it sucks"
4,A unique document,"The reviews of this release, the last quite recent, make for interesting reading. One sequence on the DVD, which appeared in the original theatrical release but was deleted from an earlier Rhino VHS version, has been mentioned not at all. It is a hauntingly beautiful song sung by a charming then-young couple with the line ""Where are you going in your rocket ships? What do you expect to find? Another land for you to conquer? You're out of your mind!""This song, nicely captured on the terrace of the Hollywood apartment of the creators of the film, is almost worth the price of the DVD to me, although the Hendrix footage and some of the scenery are not bad either.Other than that, I cannot disagree with most other comments on it - it can be painful to watch - but must note that the word ""amateur"" derives from a root meaning ""to love"" and that the mind sets glimpsed here are not purely relics of the ""psychedelic sixties."" I give it four stars for uniqueness!"
3,Hendrix alone in a brief moment carries this film,Looking down deep into volcanoes mind he finds peace in a wind that can't resist a touch strangely familar a fragrance forgotten then remembered a play no saw coming I look at these hands i look towards the sky and wonder who holds you now jimi
2,"Great Hendrix Performance, very little else to see",I finally went out and brought this DVD having seen the concert performance on a collectors DVD I was curious to see what the rest of the movie was like.I can say I am not impressed with Pat Hartley in this film and the total lack of direction and story to this so called movie.The only thing I enjoyed id Jimi's brief chat with some of the cast and his brilliant concert (all 17 minutes) that Jimi Hendrix contributed to this film.It is a somewhat historic film as some reviewers have pointed out but for me it really is just a poorly made film made by some space cadets.
5,Hendrix+Maui+Gibson Flying V=Priceless,"I saw this movie in the theater and as a Hendrix fan way back then it was great. Compare how Hendrix looked and played at Woodstock to him on the slopes of Haleakala and its an epiphany! He looked healthy and his music was ushering in the new decade. Ignore the rest of the movie and listen carefully to Hey Baby and Ezy Rider. Remember also, that this was before anybody knew what a ""Maui"" was."
3,Wait and wait .......,"Only for hardcore Jimi fans. This is a documentary about a pop fest in hawaii. Not nearly as good as ""Woodstock"" the movie, sometimes kinda cheesy with lotsa footage of Jimi, stoned to the bone, mumbling a bunch of nonsense. You will have to fast forward A LOT to get to Jimi playing. Is it worth it ? I don't know. Very little Jimi, too much everything else......"
1,worst film of all the taped Hendrix performances,"Hendrix had many performances taped during his short musical career. And none of these performances have been released in their entire. So don't be fooled by the line 125-minute, uncut performance. The sad truth is that only 30 minutes of the film features Hendrix performing. The other 95 minutes are boring hippie rubish wich no one wants to see. Worst thing is how, the way to short, Hendrix performance is compiled (people who own the live CD of the performance will know what I mean)Hear my train are coming, Vodoo Child and Purpel Haze are cut into a medly! . My advice don't buy this, buy the new released DVD-Hendrix Live at the Filmore East (available at Amazon) or see if you can get Jimi Plays Berkeley (unfortunately not available at the time)"
2,"Great LOUD music, softly narrated","Although the dynamics are impressive on this CD, I am constantly adjusting the volume to accommodate my toddler. The volume range of the instruments varies from soft to VERY VERY LOUD. The narrator tells a very amusing version of Peter and the Wolf, in that the Wolf gets taken to the Zoo. However, he has a very soft voice, so I constantly have to turn the volume up to hear his voice and then down so that the music is not overwhelming. An older child might love this feature, but I would not advise it for young children."
4,No Liquorville skit,"I love to see JT on SNL and Lady Gaga addition this round was great. There are a lot of funny skits but its missing the one that made me buy ... liquorville where JT is dressed as a liquor bottle playing off of omeletteville, homelessville, and plasticville."
2,"Smaller than advertised, not as flexible",Well I guess you get what you pay for. Product was smaller than advertised and not as easy to install. I wouldn't purchase another one. I would also recommend sticking to the stretchable string type version you put over trees to protect from the birds.Not recommended.
3,Sent it Back,"Product description describes 1/4 inch mesh. When product arrived, the holes were much larger so I sent it back. Other than that, everything was OK."
2,So so,Good for one time use unless you permanently mount it. Putting it up and taking down can be done with a lot of effort. I threw it away. Way too hard to handle. Buy a larger mesh net.
5,perfect protection for pond vs fall leaves,netting that we used to cover fish pond to keep the falling leaves from littering and causing decay. can throw fish food thru net without any trouble as well as allows air and light in.
2,Not the best but does the job,"If you are needing netting to cover your pond to keep animals, leaves, etc out for a season then this will do the job. When I went to remove it in the Spring after putting it down in late fall, it pretty much fell apart. I'll be looking for a more robust product this year."
5,Multiple uses,"I strung this about 6' above my flower bed (between a porch and a fence) to keep the balls, frisbees and other 'accidentally' tossed items out of the flowers. It works great. Thanks."
1,Eiger Solo,This would of been a great video if it actually worked. There is good history and awesome camera work but DVD did not play through instead it would stop at every scene and leave the viewer in the scene menu requiring the viewer to physically click on next scene in order to continue watching the video.I returned the DVD in exchange for another. The return and exchange transaction went smoothly and I got the new DVD in 2 days! Unfortunately the replacement DVD had the same issues. Maybe it was a bad batch but I didn't bother trying to get a third one.
1,a great film dissed on disc,"Eiger Solo is one of the great mountaineering films, beautifully written, filmed and finished.This DVD, however, is a travesty: a washed-out picture, poor sound -- even the navigation controls don't work right.Does Leo Dickinson know about this bum package?"
4,Eiger Solo,"I first saw part of this documentary in the mid 80's and have been looking for it ever since. The production is not great nor the picture, but still very viewable. Well done, and does a good job of keeping on subject with details and statistics. It is shorter than I remember. The shot of the climber falling thousands of feet, landing and rolling down the mountainside will be with me forever. He was even wearing a red coat. A must for any fan of mountain climbing, and not necessarily a climber, as I am not that brave or stupid."
1,Useless Program,The first indication that this is a BAD product is that it will not completely install on my computer. It gets to 84% and stops the instillation. This has happened with 5 tries. The second indication is that Tech Support does not offer any support. They send back questions that have no relation to the problem.I have tried the instillation on 2 different computers with the same results. DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS PROGRAM.
3,Good Ware for What It Is,"Good Ware For What It Is And It Has Plenty Of Possibilities With A Really Easy (Simple) UI.Scripts or Code If You Dare,Is Relatively Easy Regardsless But This Vessal Helps In Its Own Fashion and Form.I Would Go As Far As To Say Its Worth The Small Amount Of Money.But As Always, Do A In Depth Search Into What Your Buying First."
1,Easy for.... WHO?,I happened on this product today while looking for other things. I immediately had an urge to be a good citizen and warn others about this product. I suppose it would be EASY for someone who already knows how to program in Visual Basic. I don't. That's why I bought the program. I need EASY. I was very dissapointed and frustrated because there is a skill in communicating to others where you don't go over their head and that you don't talk down to them. This program assumes too much about users and we know what happens when we (ass)ume things :)
3,An average product...,"This is an average product in my opinion with not much really shining in it. Personally, I would just get Visual BASIC. Visual BASIC is about as ""basic"" as it comes when it comes to programing. If you think learning VB is hard then try making a program using C++. I'm not talking about VisualC++, im talking about actually opening up a compiler and typing the program out from scratch!"
3,Products that shouldn't exist,"I never baught the product, but I have delt with many non-programer software kits. After getting nowhere with all of them, I decided that I was better off just learning how to program. And I found that by putting my mind to it, I taught myself Microsoft Visual Basic, Visual C#, and even though I am only 16 I even managed to teach myself Visual C++. All I am going to say about this product is, lets face it, there is no effective way to write software then in a programing language like the ones listed above. If you don't like microsoft, there are many other companies also that develop similar products. Either way do your self a favor, rather than trying a dummy tool that probably won't get the job done, just learn how to program. It really aint that hard."
3,Good graphics .. no plot.,"Heavy Gear is a CGI animated show, derived from a videogame of the same name, about the adventures of young mechanic who gets to realize his dream of becoming a robot warrior.While the graphics and animation are extremely well done, the show is clearly targeted at a fairly young audience (8-13). Older viewers expecting a show with the sophistication of Starship Troopers will be disappointed. Each episode is more or less a 1/2 hour CGI movie that feels like a video game session (put a bunch of robots in an arena and fight it out with a bare semblance of a plot)."
3,An indifferent performance?,"A surprisingly chilly, indifferent performance of a beautiful work. There is precision - for the most part - but lacking a sense of urgency or affection. The engineering favors the strings and highlights the warmth and virtuosity of the Cleveland strings, but leaves their fabled brass distant and down right tiny (and tinny) sounding. It never ceases to amaze how so much can be rendered into so little. A shame, really."
3,What happened?,"There is something seriously amiss with the opening of Finlandia. There is a huge edit after the first statement in the low brass. The decay is chopped off, and this wreaks havoc with the pacing here. Not a good way to start. But the fundamental question is: why would there be an edit here anyway? The Cleveland Orchestra should not need an edit after the first two notes of anything. An embarrassing mistake on the part of Telarc's production team.I'm so put off by this that I haven't tried the rest of the disc. The three stars are for a reserved judgment on it."
4,Classic Horror Story,"Not much blood and gore and special effects as in later movies such as Poltergeist, but this is a real classic in the black-and-white genre. Based on a wonderful story by the master M.R.James. The plot itself is absoutely perfect, although the movie itself shows a low production budget (such as the hero fighting an obvious stuffed panther). In spite of that, the direction is fantastic. Whether or not the Demon should have been shown is a controversy, but I think it's better that it was even if it looks hokey."
5,At Last; the Original Version,"Jacques Tourneur, who cut his teeth in the 40s with Val Lewton's ""B"" horror unit at RKO, making such out of print classics as I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE and THE CAT PEOPLE (and when will someone release the complete RKO Val Lewton series on DVD, I'd like to know??) created a superb film that was then recut by producer Hal Chester, undermining the atmospheric sense of dread in the original. But now you can see the American and the UK version, and judge for yourself. Dana Andrews is colorless as the obligatory US star in a low budget UK production, but Niall McGinnis as his adversary delivers a performance of boldness and daring. Tourneur's production is immaculate throughout; this is one of the classic horror films of all time. Buy immediately; this is an excellent disc."
4,On Disk at Last!,"Curse of the Demon is one of my all-time favorites. While the special effects are often far from special (the string is clearly visible when the parchment is escaping it's victim), the rest of the film more than makes up for it. The monster is seen too often and too soon, but I suppose that's why I liked the movie as a kid. This is without a doubt one of the best horror films of all time. Since not that many people are familiar with the movie I was pleasantly suprised to see it released on DVD."
5,Horror 101 for Filmmakers,"The film is truly believable. I loved the seance (an avenue of good or evil) where various personalities speak. If you've ever witnessed the real thing, or know someone who has, you'll know this is frighteningly similar. It is here that you get a glimpse of the realities of Satanism. One of the 3 main characters, Professor Karswell, invited evil into his life by assembling cults and administering evil from his resplendent estate. Jacques Tourneur brilliantly directed Curse of the Demon. I've since sought out other Tourneur works."
5,A classic in the genre,"Like Tourneur's ""Cat People,"" this is an object lesson in light, shadow, and the idea that less is more. Based on an excellent story by M. R. James, this is an unusually literate horror film. The demon effects (added later) detract only slightly from the film's effectiveness. Trivia note: in Kate Bush's song ""Hounds of Love,"" the opening lines (""It's in the trees! It's coming!"") are from this film. Kate must like it, too."
4,Good adaptation of M.R. James story.,"Jacques Tourneur was a master of subtle horror, achieving his effects with shadows and implication. The studio supposedly forced him to include the explicit demon in this movie--otherwise this might have been a 5 star. The evil magician is supposed to have been based on Alastair Crowley."
4,If they'd only gotten rid of the big rubber demon!,"This is one heck of a stylish, well-paced thriller. The story centers on a character loosely based on Aliester Crowley, a well-known thaumaturgist and devil-cult guru. To rebuff investigations into his legitimacy, he unleashes an ancient demonic curse as proof of his arcane powers.One is immediately struck by the startlingly effective cinematography--the pristine black and white textures, the gloom-filled night scenes, the sumptuous tones. The acting is remarkably natural for a piece from the 1950's, and the story is taught, well-crafted, and thoroughly engaging.I'm told that the studio insisted on having a ""real"" demon for the audience to see. What a shame. Without the rubbery, stiff-fingered demon, this film would have easily earned five stars."
3,"A splendid supernatural shocker, one of the best","I actually give 3 1/2 stars. There is very little I can add here because for this film your other customer comments are right on the money. Curse of the Demon is a splendid example of what can be achieved on a low budget with skill, intelligence and imagination. It puts most of today's super- gore shockers to shame. This is arguably Jacques Tourneur's best film."
3,Curse of the Demond / Night of the Demond,"Warning both movies in this disc are one and the same twice under two different titles.I enjoy watching these old classics and this is one of them. I just wish it had bothmovies, but than again maybe the original came out with two different titles.Both movies start up with the two different titles but there one and the same."
4,Yellow smears on the picture.,"Why are the English subtitles colored yellow??It draws too much attention, and ruins the viewing pleasure.The Japanese text is white, and it looks much better!"
5,MAYBE IT'S BEST NOT TO KNOW,"It even frightens the cynical. Dr. Holden doesn't believe until he almost crosses the line. Maybe it's best not to know, which, thankfully, doesn't invite a sequel. The demon invisible was more horrifying than the demon visible. Maybe it's best not to know."
3,Good for the Era,"I enjoyed this movie not because it was such a good horror film but because it was representative of the era, the time it was made. Predictable and not horrifying. It is a good addition to my film library. I'm glad these oldies are making it to DVD."
3,Simple old fashioned B grade movie,"To be honest, I only rented this film out of curiosity about what the line in the title song of Rocky Horror Picture Show means: ""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes"". Although runes are an integral part of the film, prunes aren't even mentioned. It wasn't until later I figured out that the line is just a play on words: ""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the run(e)s""."
4,Night of the Demon,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
1,Laughable,"The creature is laughable, even by the special effects standards of 1957. And what would possess--no pun intended--a class-A actor like Dana Andrews to appear in this abysmal film is beyond justification, other than, perhaps, for money."
1,A Really Bad Joke,"I made the mistake of buying this DVD based on its overwhelmingly positive reviews, which often link it in style and content to one of the best horror films ever made, ""Burn, Witch, Burn."" What could be going on in people's minds??? ""Night of the Demon"" is idiotic, a repetitive sledgehammer of one cheesy cliche after another. Unwatchable."
2,I'm disappointed,"I'm almost 7yrs old and I bought myself this toy with money I received for Christmas 2003. I was very disappointed especially with a barbie toy .The pieces, kids across America can lose these pieces and parents will feel sorry because they pay alot of money for it."
5,Boatload of fun!,"My five-year-old daughter received this from Santa this Christmas, and she's had a ball with it so far. Another reviewer mentioned that the front doesn't stay on well, and that's the only problem I've noticed. I especially like the way all the pieces store inside the ship when it's closed, there's even a place to put small pieces. I got mine free, but I would have paid $60 for it, I think it was a good value."
2,Not what my daughter expected!!!,"My daughter had received this for a gift, luckily I hadn't purchased it. The top front part of the ship does not hold on tight enough. And there really isn't too much to do with it. My daughter was expecting more from it. I also thought that there were some kind of beverages and cups and things that you were supposed to get, did not see them in the box. For a Barbie product, I really am not impressed."
1,don't waste your money,"I hate this toy. It is very big and takes up the entire room. My daughter played with it a few days after Xmas and hasn't shown any interest since that time. There a tons of pieces to gather all over the floor. There were so many stickers I still not know where to put them. I am not sure it can go in the water and that's where my daughter wants to take the ship. It comes with a camera that does something, but we have not figured it out. I am glad I did not spend the $...for this toy."
5,Barbie Cruise Ship A+++,"A Christmas present that my two daughters, 9 and 6 played with all day. They love it. It is sturdy, roomy and a lot of fun. I reccommend this toy."
2,Disappointed,Color faded dramatically and stained the inside or my dryer blue. It finally came off after about 3 weeks. Pillowcases are stiff too...low quality
4,A Little Too Stately,"A good performance, affectionate and precise, sound is very good, Previn plays beautifully, but somehow the joy has been lost. Almost certainly because the performance is rather slow, the Mozart takes 12% longer than Haebler and the Bamberg Wind Quintet on Philips Duo. Disappointing, I expected a great interpretation, but I expect this Mozart to sparkle."
5,Marriage Counseling: A Christian Approach to Counseling Couples,The author of Marriage Counseling is a gem. He is on the mark in this book.
4,Monterey Place Names,Great book for those living in or around Monterey. There needs to be an updated book as some of the things inside have changed. Great reference book.
1,Bad...,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of the Deviant videos, which is why I am so surprised with how bad this particular title is. I bought it to introduce my students to fantasy literature, but found this title lacking substance, and very poor in the details of what this genre of literature is. This one is not entertaining, or instructive unlike their other titles...Pass on this one, not worth the money."
1,Errata Without End...,"Another book rushed to the market before adequate technical editing was done...I picked this book up from my instructor's desk during a break - he happens to be a MCNE and MCNI and is (only now, after it has been published) technically editing this book.Well, the errors are volumous; he mentioned that his editing comments amounted to about seven pages, if I remember correctly. I saw LOTS of red ink. Coreolis will eventually make the errata file available to you on their website, of course. But do you want to download all of this and correct the book before using? That should be Coreolis's job BEFORE you buy it. The odd error, sure - but this is ridiculous.I can't comment on whether this will get you through the test or not, but Coreolis shouldn't be rewarded for such poorly published work with your hard earned dollars. Technical editing should be done BEFORE publishing - not after you've bought it..."
1,Very poorly edited and does not cover all exam objectives,"I am an experienced 4.11 CNA, but was not able to make an acceptable score on any of the practice tests after reading this book until I bought CNE Clarke Notes book. With the Clarke Notes book I passed the exam with a 93. Don't waste your time or money with the Exam Cram for CNA 5 book. However, I did find the Exam Cram for NDS Design & Implementation book very, very helpful in passing that test."
1,Very poor actually - Not to be trusted for exam success,"I thought the Exam Cram for NT Server 4 was the key to my success in getting my MCP, so I thought the same would apply to an Exam Cram for Novell... Wrong!... This book has some good information in it, but it has HUGE holes in the presented information which is hopeless for the exam... The sample tests are nothing like the actual, and the book has many mistakes in it... Initially I read this book along with David James Clarke's CNA Study Guide (which is excellent)... This book only confused me because it seems to follow it's own study path which didn't flow with the Clarke book... The Clarke book was written specifically for the Novell exam and is authorised by Novell... That should say it all...When I threw this book away and concentrated on the Clarke book my study began to flow again..."
1,A Disapointment to the Exam Cram Series,This sould not be a tool you use to pass the exam!I usually use the Exam Crams on the last week before the exam. After using this book I was lucky I passed. It has example questions that are wrong and many mistakes. One questions about Country being a required objects is answered 2 different ways.(it is not a required object!)The technical editors shoud be embarased. If this book was proofread at all.
5,Clever and challenging puzzles,"I love these puzzles by Nova Design! I also bought the butterfly one. My 5 year old niece loves puzzles and is very good at putting them together. These 48 piece puzzles are much more challenging than the 24 piece ones she also has. They are big pieces though and not too difficult for her to handle. The most fun part of these puzzles is they include hidden pictures within the big pictures of the fish/butterflies. The puzzle includes a poster that contains riddles giving you clues to find the hidden pictures within the puzzle. We did the butterfly one together and it was challenging, but fun, and the kids found a lot of the hidden pictures on their own, with some adult help. It definitely holds their attention longer than a regular puzzle because of the hidden pictures."
1,don't buy it,I purchased this truck at Toys r Us with the service plan. It broke after 3 months (electrical). When I contacted the service plan co. to fix it they gave me the run a round for a month and my son is still out of a $299.00 toy.
3,what about vegetarians?,"This book has very little in it for vegetarians. How does one avoid carbs if one is a vegetarian? Sure, it's possible! But where are the recipes for us vegetarians? So far, every low carb book I've looked at has very little without chicken broth, meat, and shrimp and so on in nearly every recipe!"
3,Fabulous Low Carb Cuisine,"While some of the recipes in this book aren't bad, I found them to be way too high in carbs. The carb counts don't look too high until you read the serving size. Most of the dip recipes have a serving size of 2 teaspoons. That means 2 level measuring teaspoons. For most of us that is not even a bite!"
3,Inaccurate serving sizes,"This is a great book- the recepies are tasty and easy to make.However, there are too many recepies where the serving sizes are listed as ""makes 2 or 3 servings"", and then goes on to list the carb count for ""per serve"".How are you supposed to get an accurate carb count per serving if each recepie is divided by ""2 or 3"". As low-carbers already know, every gram counts, so accuracy is vital."
5,Great desserts!,"I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners, so the dessert recipes in this book took me by surprise. All the ones I've tried are wonderful!"
2,Horribly edited,This book has more errors -- demonstrating a complete failure to proofread and copyedit -- than any other book I've ever bought in the Kindle Store.
2,Often inaccurate,"It's a decent workbook in some respects and helps learning the difference between a statement (with a period) and question (with a question mark), common nouns, plural nouns and irregular verbs. It's only about 60 pages long, so don't expect anything comprehensive. But my biggest complaint is that the directions are incorrect. So it will say, for instance, ""look at the underlined word(s)"" to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect.And then will include in the answer sheet, words that are not underlined. For instance ""will [u]you[/u] see the vet again? is marked as inaccurate by them b/c ""will"" is not capitalized, but it's not underlined, so how would a child know they are supposed to include that, given they have been told to only look at the underlined words?I think it's poorly executed and would look for a different workbook."
3,Nice book!!!,It's a nice workbook. I bought it for my 7 year old daughter. She can read & understand her own without much supervision.It has 64 pages and new book costs only 4.99$.
2,Needs an editor,"Reads like a first draft. Although there might be a good story worth telling within its pages, A Face in the Moon is overloaded with long drawn-out dialogue that slows the forward motion and details that don't contribute to the story. Waldman has a gift for describing visual nuances and characters gestures and body language, but this book could be half as long and be better for it."
4,red riding hood,was a very nice costume that arrived very promptly. Only complaint I had was the hood was an annoying length.
1,"THIS IS OFF THE HOOK, BUT NEEDS WORK","Yo, I'm serious; these dolls are off the hook! But it needs a little work. For example; the female dolls are slammin' but they need cell phones hanging off their belts! They need to be holding their little babies too! Even the singles mamas have to get out there! And the male dolls look too...how can I say it delicately...gay? They look prettier then the girls! The male dolls also need to be holding a cell phone in one hand, and a 40-once in the other (to look mo' real). You feel me? And they need cigarettes! Preferably Newports, menthol cigs (or Kools)- you know how we do!"
5,Stormin' Norman!,"For many of us, Norman Blake is the consummate old-time musician. Sure, Doc Watson gets more publicity, and Tony Rice is smooth and powerful, but no artist comes closer to the tone and character of old-time music than Norman. This recording has been on my 'frequent play' list for over four years, and I'm not shelving it any time soon. For you intermediate to advanced flatpickers, this is like the Jane Fonda Workout - I've never met a flatpicker who hadn't tried to keep up with Norman while listening to this record. Fingerpickers can also delight - tasteful versions of ""The Ash Grove"" and ""The Minstrel Boy to War Has Gone"" are here as well. 5 stars really doesn't do this one justice."
5,The Skies Opened,"Hearing this album was a revelation. ""Frank! Put down that infernal electric guitfiddle and listen to Whiskey Before Breakfast."" The skies opened and the Slow Train Through Georgia rolled into my station.Never been the same since; thanks Norman, for 20 years of pickin pleasure."
5,the master,"I've owned this CD since high school and listen to it constantly. It was the first Blake recording I bought and I did so without having ever heard him before; I had heard my older guitarist friends say good things about him and chose this one because I was familiar with more of the tunes on it than on the other albums in the rack. This is terrific playing--clean, no-gimmick flatpicking. Absolutely a great album."
1,YUCK!,"I find these disgusting. Who came up with this?Even if I found the dolls acceptable (which I don't), they certainly shouldn't be pushed on young children. They'll be force fed enough pop culture as they get older.As a side note, does anyone else notice that the 5 star reviews for these dolls are barely readable?"
2,FLAVAS are Hip!,"I think that Flavas are new and exciting not like all those other fashionaby dolls there COOL & HIP not like all those other classic dolls,"
3,Totally Spank,dese toys r da bomb dey r so cool so much betta dan Babies or Bratz or Hary Poter i wish dey made em like days ago.DEY R PHAT YOWORD TO HOME GRLZ FROM DA STREETS DA POPOS AINT EVA GET USPEESE OUT
2,Not Cheeze-its!,"I am always looking for healthy, organic snacks for my girls. This is one that no one liked. They do not taste like your traditional cheese crackers like GoldFish or Cheeze-its. We do Love Late July's peanut butter and cheese filled crackers, those are much better. Bottom line-- try before you buy in bulk!"
3,A goat/hog could like these!,Most of the bags were not sealed! Stingy with the untastey cheese. Rather stale & yuckey! Wish I had not bought them!
3,Kids loved them,"Our kids loved these crakers. The individual serving bags are convienent for lunchs. I thought they had very little flavor, but the kids kept asking for them. Maybe its just the difference between adult and kids taste buds."
3,"Informative, but generic","I found this book to be informative, however, if you've read any potty training advice before, it's basically the same information you've already read. If you are just beginning potty training and haven't been reading on it, it would be a big help!"
3,"Great ideas, you'll still find your own way",Loved this book but it was a little too advanced for my 2 year old. She's not really into charts and stickers and the like. I did try but it went over her head. I think this is a good book to take ideas from and then make them your own.
1,Give me a break.,If you want useful advice look elsewhere. This book is loaded with outdated advice. I decided not to follow her advice since I was afraid it would screw up my kids!
5,Rendell's Masterpiece,"The novelette included in this collection, ""The Strawberry Tree,"" may well be Rendell's masterpiece, the single work that stands above all her other many fine novels and stories. It's a work of exquisite craftsmanship and deep psychological depth. I gasped at one point, laughed at another, and ended in tears. A British television adaptation (with the same title; you can find details at imbd.com) is also excellent."
1,waste of time,"I got this product and to my surprise it only has WIN 98/WIN2000/WINDOWS XP drivers.Wasted lots of time trying to install XP drivers "" in compatibility "" mode of Windows 7/ Windows Vista and MAC ( Mac OS X Lion ).IT DOES NOT WORK.If you need just a scanner : this is definitely the thing you DO NOT WANTSee the product support page at this address[...]"
2,"sounds okay, breaks easily, great idea","I have purchased this item twice, and each time, within 3-4 months daily use, the cord or the ear piece broke. I think from the constant retraction the wire starts to fray on the inside, or the ear piece sometimes just pops apart after the tension becomes too great.Definitely not purchasing them a third time around..."
3,Not recommended for long uses,"The best use for this retractable headset is to pop it into your handbag or glove compartment in the car. It won't get tangled, it'll be there for the odd times where you need to have a headset, and maybe don't have your main ones handy."
1,Totally disappointed,"I ordered these earbuds even though I read the review that said the item received wasn't the one that was pictured. I figured that after a review like that and the passage of several months, the problem would have been resolved. Boy, was I wrong! That reviewer was right. The earbuds received were NOT in-ear earbuds, they don't fit well enough to use, and the sound is tinny. I've been a happy Amazon customer for a while now and I'm definitely not happy that the item received was not the one pictured. I've lost faith in Amazon and don't know that I can trust them like I used to."
1,It is unusable. Do never buy.,cable becomes disorganized immidiately after a few usage. Takes a lot of time to reorganize. I do not suggest.
3,Retractable..Nice. Sound...Sucky!!!,"I am obsessed with the retractable earbuds for working out. I bought a $20 pair of Sony's, after my Emerge went out, and they were terrible. The sound was great, but they were not retractable and they would fall out of my ears, get caught on the machinery, etc. So, I bought these thinking my old Emerge had pretty good sound, so should these. The sound is terrible, but the concept is genius.Does anybody know of a retractable set of earbuds that does not sound terrible? Please Help!!!!March 14th Cont........I found them. Get the iblasters. Just got them in today and they are so much better."
1,Straight wire v 90 degree,"Bought 2 of the RETRAK's thinking it is a novel idea. The straight attachment at the 3.5mm end on both are now broken. I guess from the ""wringing"" action.Notice the newer ones have a 90 degree attachment. Have not tried, didn't want to invest again."
1,Worst earbuds I ever bought,"I had a pair of Philips earbuds in my hand at the store, but I put them back because I found these earbuds for a few bucks cheaper. I have never had earbuds that sounded this bad. There is ZERO bass. It almost sounds like a transistor radio in my ears, like listening to music on an AM radio station. I should have known that the product had no clue about bass when I saw ""clear sound with deep base"" on the product package. If they don't know how to spell it, they sure don't know how to engineer it. Spend the extra few bucks on a better pair. Any other pair has to be better than this one."
1,Worst headphones I've ever owned,"I bought these as an experiment, I hear some background hiss when listening to music via my laptop and I'd read that 32ohm-or-greater headphones reduce the hiss. I was able to buy these ReTrak headphones 1/2 price at a store that was going out of business. Even at 1/2 price they aren't worth the money. All I got out of it was some indication that higher-impedence headphones probably would help me, but these particular headphones are so bad that I'm better off tolerating the hiss with my original earbuds.The sound with ReTraks is horrible, it feels like you are sitting in a metal oil drum. Also, there are no markings on the buds to tell you which channel is which. Finally the retraction mechanism is badly designed, snarls easily (it can take you an hour or two to figure out how to unsnarl if the cord jumps the internal track), and doesn't have many convenient ratchet points for holding a comfortable listening position."
3,"Decent grip, useless battery","I agree with both the other reviewers here, the grip is very useful for aleving cramping and holding the psp while walking. The battery is pretty awful though. I took mine apart, there are 2 rechargeable AAA batteries with some pretty cheap soldering in there. I would advise buying the ""other"" cta grip without the batteries which sells for about half the price of this one."
1,Rechargeable Battery?,I couldn't find a lower star than 1 so I had to give it a one.Tried charging it up a few times but couldn't get more than 1/2 hour playback time. (music playback-no game playback)It's just a nice attachment for gripping....Don't waste your money here.
3,Good Item,"The plus side of this item is that it is comfortable and my hands don't cramp up. OK, maybe they cramp up after hours of gameplay anyway, but not like they used to with the little control system on the PSP.The down side is that the rechargeable battery doesn't exist. The company says it is there and that it works, but I have found that I get no additional game time by plugging it in. I have charged it individually and seperately from my PSP, but the result is the same...no result.So the battery thing is disappointing but the comfort of the control is great. I therefore give this a recommendation, with the caveat that you should not be duped into thinking there will be longer battery life."
4,"Excellent grip, crappy battery.","I'd owned one of these before purchasing another here on Amazon. The tines on my last one broke off because I didn't realize that this grip was made to fit the PSP Slim models, and not the thicker 1st generation PSP 1000. My bad.Anyway, I own a PSP 3000 now, and this grip works perfectly. It eliminates all the cramping and discomfort I suffered through trying to play games like Monster Hunter and Dissidia: Final Fantasy, which require high levels of dexterity. In my opinion, this grip is the best, lowest priced, lowest maintenance PSP grip on the market.The advertised ""6-hour rechargeable battery"" function is pretty much non-existent though. I don't notice that it extends my PSP's battery life at all. But I bought this knowing the battery was next to useless anyhow. For the price, the comfort this baby offers alone is most definitely worth it.An absolute must-buy, especially for PSP owners with big hands/long fingers. Your hands will thank you."
2,Sony PSP CTA Digital PS-BGR Rechargeable Battery,worked great for Mom .but was destroyed by my 12 year old in about 30 min. She broke the pins off that hold it in place when she was trying to change the games. The extended battery option was GREAT.
1,Not even 6 hours. And not comfortable using it.,It looks great but it feels horrible. When im playing my psp for more than 5mins. My hands and my fingers starts to hurt. Its seems more comfortable to play with the psp without the cradle.
1,Not Satisfied,"I bought this to ease the pain of holding onto the oddball shape of the PSP game console for long hours. Bad PacMan addict like cramps of the hands. Anyway, the first thing that I noticed was that the cheap plastic prongs that hold the console to the charge base don't take much of a beating before they break. One of the prongs broke taking it out of the package. A little epoxy and it was fixed. Next bad mojo was I couldn't get the thing to charge. Don't know what's wrong with it, just use it now for the intended purpose which is to relieve the PacMan hands and prevent carpal tunnel syndrome."
1,Grip is good....but the charge,the charge wouldn't work....wires not soldered good on batteries....still good for extra hand grip to lock on to the PSP!!
1,PSP grip with built-in charger,I do not know but it seems that this product does not really hold a charge to give me more time to play the psp even when I charged it for more than 8 hours.
1,Junk,"This grip is junk...cheap plastic does not slide open easily, flops around, and 6 hour battery never has worked"
1,"Hand grip sucks, battery sucks!","Don't waste your money, the hand grip is straight down, not angled out like it should be. That makes it hard to hold and gives your hand cramps. As for the battery, it might give you an extra half and hour, if your are lucky. Don't waste your money like it did."
4,useful but not pretty,"We had one of these for a couple of years before it was dropped by one of our neighbors. We are going to get another one. It is the only one on the market, that we could find, that has the raised rim on the side that is used as a server for veggies or chips. The opposite side from the cake plate, that is. Worked great except the pedestel/bowel is attatched to the plate with glue and it came off in the dishwasher. We simply reattched it using epoxy and never had another problem. Asthetically it is not the most beautiful serving ware but it can't be beat for its utility."
1,Grand Finale,"I have read two other of Janet Evanovich's romance novels and all of the Stephanie Plum that are out (17, I think...and am anxiously waiting for the Finger Lickin Fifteen due in June). Grand Finale is a romance novel and I am finding it silly and boring. It is almost like someone other than Janet Evanovich wrote it. I am on page 80 but I am not even sure I am going to bother finishing it."
2,Disappointingly Predictable,This was a book that would have been quite adequate and much more satisfying as a short story. The reasons for all the extra pages completely escape me. Ho hum.
3,"Good book, if you like short romance stuff","Not as good as her Plum series, but good I guess if you like romance stuff. I tend to like more action and comedy in my books, hence the reason why I've read all the Plum books (THEY'RE GOOD). But hey.. they're not bad... just a little too sappy for me."
5,"Fast read, charming, priceless",Janet Evanovich has got to be the worlds most entertaining author. Look foreword to each book she has written that comes out. Wish they came faster but she probably does have other things to do. I recommend anything she writes.
1,Not a good book at all--reminds me of a starter author,"Bought this book in audio book--the voice of the person reading it was annoying.But the story line was angora bunny fur fluffy. But no substance.It was not ""side-splitting funny"" like one of the reviews said from the media. It was side-splitting stupid. No one could have such constant bad luck and ridiculousness, except the early early days of Ellen D the commediene before she came out. No show I would watch more than once, it was so utterly stupid, and this book follows the same line. Don't buy it."
4,Another Stellar event,"As always, Evanovich enchants me. She has a delightful touch with humor--and with the way she approaches the world. She presents characters with a zany touch of reality as well as a blessing for each reader. I hope she keeps going--and going--and going..."
4,Great book!!!!!,"Another great book. Thank you janet evanovich. You have such a way with words, and the rapport you build between your characters is enticing and wonderful."
3,NO STEPHANIE PLUM BOOK,I LOVE JANET EVANOVICH BUT NEED TO STICK WITH HER PLUM BOOKS. HER OLD BOOKS ARE SORT OF THROWN TOGETHER.
4,A Lighthearted Romance Novel With Some Humor Added,This is another of Evanovich's lighthearted romance novels. It is a quick fun read.
4,What I've come to expect..,"This book lives up to the expectations I have for Janet Evanovich. Fun to read, an excape from the day-to-day."
4,pretty good,This book took a little longer than most of my orders through amazon do but overall the book was in great condition and the price was wonderful!
5,awsome,awsome i love it so much. I wish she would more even quicker. she is the best auther/. please add alot more
1,THE GRAND FINALE,"The Grand Finale was a grand disappointment. I loved all of the Stephanie Plum novels but, I found it hard to believe this was written by the same author. The character was similar but much less interesting. This book was a waste of my time! Boring"
2,quick read,"story line was kind of cute.Quick read. Liked authors other books better. If you need to relax from a hectic day, this book is for you."
1,What a waste of time,"I am a big fan of Janet Evanoich, but I find it hard to believe that anyone could enjoy reading this book. It was obviously written before Evanovich became famous and I'm surprised that she would even let it be published, as it was that bad. An 8th grader could have written a better book - no offense to 8th graders! The first 2 pages were about the only good pages in the book. It was all downhill from there. There is barely any plot and what plot there is, is boring and unbelievable. The characters and not very well developed either. This book was just a bunch of boring drivel. I could not even finish it. I don't recommend wasting your money on this book, if you feel you must read this, get it from the library or borrow from a friend. It's not worth the money. This obviously is a case of the author cashing in on her name and digging up everything she's ever written to make some money. Perhaps she did write in while in 8th grade?"
2,snore,"Picked the wrong book from the wrong series. Thought I was getting something else, but I now know what not to read."
4,"Quick, Easy, Fun",This is a terrific and easy cookbook with healthy recipes you can feel good about. Easy to follow even for those of us who don't really know our way around the kitchen. I've been using it for years.
3,Not for the beginner,"I'm researching wiccan and witch rituals and I thought I would take a look at this book and try some of the rituals. A beginner in spellcraft should start with another book. The spells are cool and most seem really easy to do, but it's a great pain to find them. If you wanted to use a spell for another occasion, you would have to look through most of the book to find them. An index, or color-coded pages would have been extremely helpful. Finally, there was hardly any explanation as to what the colors and objects are supposed to signify so you kind of have to guess for yourself. I expected something more thorough. But I definately recommend this for people with more advanced knowledge of the craft."
4,Could be even better!,"More illustrations and above all more plentiful and better maps would have made Porter's superlative history of London an unqualified masterpiece. As such, it is still a bloody good book. The late Roy Porter was not only a brilliant historian, above all of the 18th century for which his enthusiasm is nearly overwhelming, but a writer of verve and wit far removed from much desiccated academism. It would be a fitting tribute for Harvard to bring out an expanded edition awash with bells and whistles. Let's hope."
3,Some stories OK,"I am a third grade teacher and purchased this book as a read aloud for my class. The first story, The Day It Snowed Tortillas, is engaging for the kids. Other stories contained some content that I was uncomfortable reading to the students. Some stories included drunk characters, or ""stupid"" charachters that were taken advantage of. It is probably more appropriate for a bit older students."
2,Short Story collection,"I did not realize this was a chapter book, each being a different tale. Some come from Mexico, some from Southwest United States. They are told differently and the moral is not always what you would expect."
5,Best bilingual book ever!,"This book is outstanding both as a learning tool for Spanish and simply the joy of a good story. The problem with many bilingual books is they are based on classic Spanish literature, which much like Shakespeare, is not written in how people speak Spanish today, especially in Mexico and the south-west U.S.. Instead, the author wrote these stories recently and in, as far as I can tell, modern Mexican Spanish. I think he uses a little poetic license here and there, but the intermediate Spanish student like me should have no trouble understanding it. I'm trying hard to teach myself Spanish, and this book has been an enormous help and pleasure to read. I hope that Joe Hayes publishes more bilingual books in the future."
3,Light entertainment...,"This is a very light book with some very nice and ""cute"" photographs. Good for the coffeetable or bathroom."
5,Do Not Miss!,"One of the most enjoyable books about self -promotion in the business world. Easy reading..lots of resources. If you are self-publishing or just need to get hints about self promoting your business, spend the few dollars and purchase the book."
3,Still seeing sharply,"3 1/2Always refreshingly reassuring to see so called ""old-timers"" asserting a startling diversity, crisp interplay, and informed songwriting even if it all doesn't fly."
3,NO É EXCEPCIONAL !,"Com certeza no é o melhor do FOCUS. Comprei pela curiosidade, por ser o último lanamento, e por ter todos os discos oficiais do grupo. Segue a linha normal da banda, mas este no é excepcional."
4,Greattttt!!!!,"I really liked the WENDIGO part of the book, it was amazing!!!The part about the BLACK SPIRAL DANCERS was not so great, though, because it was a confusing read with things shifting in the Spiral, and people coming and going, because Arkady, the main character of this book, keeps floating between this world and the Umbra, being inside the Spiral and out of it in other places interacting with other characters, and in the end I guess I get a little lost...But when you found yourself in it the book is great!"
3,Basic Surveying,"Please note: ""Basic Surveying"" is not for use in America. This is a British book. It contains extensive information about the National Grid and the Ordnance Survey of 1791. All measurements are in meters. Obviously, some of the basic tenants of surveying will apply. I was expecting more information about geodetic mapping in the United States."
1,Oh Please!,"Flavas are dolls that are supposed to be ""like regular kids."" I find that very hard to believe. Maybe it's because these kids look like they belong in jail! And not just Tre...all of the Flavas dolls! I am suprised that they don't also have knives or guns with them!I don't understand...if you want your little girl to play with appropriate dolls, why buy this? To teach little gils that this is the kind of man she should be looking for? A gang member wannabe? This doll is not appropriate for any girl to play with. If you are looking for any doll to set at least a decent example of how guys should behave, go get a Ken doll!I know, girls everywhere are probably playing with this doll as I speak, but why encourage them? Mattel, you must know the damage you are inflicting on the young minds of society, don't you? Are you that desperate for money?"
4,Tre is Looking well.... you know,"Tre looks a little bit feminine to put it lightly and I don't think he would last a day on the streets. He comes in light blue shorts/jacket with a black t-shirt. I find his beard kind of creepy and I think most other people would too. I don't think this men are nearly as cool as Happy D, Kiony Brown, Tika or P B.O. I think you should forget about these ""girls"" (liam/tre) and use the men doll you all ready have. Personally, I think any man doll you put with the Flavas Girls would cramp their style, A.K.A. ""flava""."
3,Ordered for 3 small puppies,"I had 3 puppies that I needed to keep contained. This cage worked for a while, but once they got bigger they could easily push it and move it around. It ended up being better for closing off the stairs, rather than as a pen for them."
2,Flimsy.,"Flimsy construction, easy for small dogs to open up the side and let themself out. Not recommended for small dogs, works o.k. for my baby rabbits to play in the yard in or as a temporary gate over a large door opening."
4,Good for the price,"I bought this playpen to take care of some stray kittens I found in the highway. It was perfect for the little cats and gave them a nice area for a bed, their toys, bowls and a little room to play. I don't think it would work for an animal over maybe 15 pounds or with any real strength, and certainly not an adult cat. Good for little puppies or kittens, maybe a rabbit or chinchilla."
5,Perfect,I bought this for my bunny to run around in while I was gone. Its a perfect amount of space so that he doesn't get bored while I'm gone and the sides swing out easily to let him out to hop around when I get home.
5,just what we needed!!,"this is perfect for our ferret. he hasn't figured out how to get out, he loves being able to run around and see everything going on around him but still a safe distance from our dogs and cat and kids! we got the bottom for it to keep cleanup easy and keep the carpet from getting messed up. I also use this for our little puppy. it's great for keeping her contained but still giving her freedom while she is being house broken. if you have more than 2 ferrets, I would recommend getting the larger pen. this one is good for one or two but anymore and it would be crowded. overall, it's a great product and shipped fast!"
2,Rats and hamsters will get out.,"I've only used it a few times. My huge hamster and my smaller rats can squeeze through the bars really fast. My larger rat can climb up to the top and then climb down to get out. No matter how many toys and treats I put in there, all the pets want to do is get out. They're so occupied with escaping they don't even play! Maybe with the cover it would be fine for large enough animals, but I don't think it's worth the money."
1,Garbage,"If you're looking for a small and compact case for your PSP, keep looking. The fit on this case is so tight that when you try to place the PSP inside, the aluminum edges will cut into the sides of the PSP and either severely scratch it or chip some of the plastic off. And if you somehow manage to fit the PSP inside, the piss-poor design means that you'll most likely pierce the front of the PSP with the closing latch if you're not careful when you shut the cover.This case is now sitting in my garbage bin."
2,Crap!,"I guess you pay for what you get because this was a generic piece of crap. I thought it was made by Sony for the PSP but instead it's a generic piece of aluminium ""compatible for PSP."" I would definitely NOT recommend it! It also took forever to get to me and when I emailed the seller he did not respond to my email. I was afraid it wasn't coming at all but it finally did forever later, probably because the shipping cost the seller paid was about $0.50!"
1,TRASH,"This case is a piece of trash because it doesn't protect the whole psp,just some of it and when you close it,you have to be very careful or you're gonna chip some of your psp off.IF YOU WANT TO GET THIS,DO NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!GET THE LOGITECH PLAYGEAR POCKET HARD CASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS IS A BAD DESIGN,"DON'T GET THIS CASE. IT WILL SCRATCH YOUR PSP. THE CASE IS ALUMINUM. ALL CUTTING EDGES ARE VERY SHARP. THERE ARE VERY THIN LAYER OF SOFT CLOTH COVER SOME EDGES (BUT NOT ALL). EVEN IF THEY PUT THESE THIN CLOTH AROUND ALL EDGES, THEY WON'T HELP NEITHER. THOSE CUTTING EDGES HAVE SHARP POINTS. DON'T GET THIS CASE, IT WILL SCRATH YOUR PSP."
5,kick a$$,"this case is so cool partly because you can't find it in stores so almost nobody has it. i wanted the silver one but black on black is tight! it has some soft fabric lining the inside like felt or something but it is definitely worth the price and the wait: +/-$13.00 and it was delivered over the weekend. if your even considering a case for your psp, look no further."
2,Not a worthy sequel for Hyperion,"The two first books were, in my opinion, masterpieces. This third book of the serie is, at best, an entertaining adventure. Gone are the well depicted, complex, credible characters, the historical fresque, the surprising inventions and descriptions that serve as the background for the plot.Three somewhat tame characters will undertake a journey through wich they meet different friends and foes. The action is somewhat entertaining but linear, the plot is unoriginal,the vilains unconvincing, the stereotypes abundant, the surprises nonexistent. The worst part of Endymion, however, is that you are led to read the fourth and last opus of the serie: The rise of Endymion wich is one of the worst piece of litterature I have read since I learned to.So read the Hyperion suite and stop there. The Endymion suite is NOT even remotely as good."
2,A disappointing follow up the Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion,"Perhaps this book would have been much better if it didn't suffer so much by comparison to Hyperion/The Fall of Hyperion. Like the two previous books this actually tells one story when combined with its sequal, The Rise of Endymion. Rather than expand on the ideas in that book Simmons goes off in a new direction contradicting the previous books and giving us a story far less compelling. Don't expect the questions remaining at the end of The Fall of Hyperion to be answered. Simmons wisely leaves the mysteries of the first book intact, but this new adventure is one long and frequently boring chase scene. The Catholic church's use of the crucifixes from Hyperion is an interesting development, and Simmons' writing style is still good. But ultimately there just isn't much here."
1,Huge Disappointment,"Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are both truly excellent books...indisputably classics of the genre. That being said, I cannot overstress my disappointment in the Endymion books. Simmons' weak, formulaic plotting and 2-dimensional characters showed me that he was just going through the motions on Endymion and Rise of Endymion. The tense, gothic quality which made the first 2 books so fresh and unique is completely absent. It is a mystery to me that the average review for this book is so high. There are some interesting concepts and Mr Simmons shows the occasional flash of his talent here and there, but I honestly wish I had stopped reading this series after the second book."
3,"Dan Simmons is great, but Endymion is just adequate","Hyperion and fall Of Hyperion are SF classics. When you raise the stakes that high it's hard to come back strong. I read through this novel hoping I'd get magic in the sequel, but I haven't gotten halfway through that book after a year. Need a good read? Check out the Engines of God by Jack McDevitt."
3,If you can't get enough Hyperion...,"In honosty, i found this book to be a bit of a drop-off quality wise from the Hyperion Books. Simmons almost always brings beautifully imaginitive books to the table, but in this particular book the writing seems to suffer a bit. I wouldn't give this a 3 star review if i didnt think Simmons was one of the best writers in imaginitive literature today, but compared to the two Hyperion books or the recent Illium and Olympos, this didnt stack up."
2,Not nearly as good as Hyperion,"Man. I read this and Rise of Endymion, assuming that the pair made a complete work, like the Hyperion pair... but I was wrong. These two books were not very good. These two felt forced, whereas the Hyperion books felt inspired. --You will probably not enjoy these two books as much as you did enjoy the Hyperion books. Sorry. I wanted to like them, too."
2,Not up to Hyperion Standards,"I believe the first two books in this series to be among the best works of scifi ever written. In Hyperion, not only does the author createpaint a facinating vision of a new world, but also gives us characters whom we feel for deeply, all in a story filled with intrigue and excitiment. Lastly, the first two books are written in beautiful prose.Saddly, this work is not up to snuff. While it ties up many of the loose ends left at the end of the first books, it never grabs the reader in the same way. Nor does it create the same type of compeling world. If you loved Hyperion and had questions at the end that you wanted answered, than I suggest you read this. Just don't expect to spend weeks thinking about it like you did after reading Hyperion."
2,Poor follow-up to great Science Fiction book,"Perhaps this book would have been much better if it didn't suffer so much by comparison to _Hyperion_/_The Fall of Hyperion_. Like the two previous books this actually tells one story when combined with its sequal, _The Rise of Endymion_. Rather than expand on the ideas in that book, Simmons goes off in a new direction contradicting the previous books and giving us a story far less compelling.Don't expect the questions remaining at the end of The Fall of Hyperion to be answered. Simmons wisely leaves the mysteries of the first book intact, but this new adventure is one long and frequently boring chase scene. The Catholic church's use of the crucifixes from _Hyperion_ is an interesting development, and Simmons' writing style is still good. But ultimately there just isn't much here."
4,A satisfying return to the Hyperion universe,"Though not as sweeping or intricately woven as the previous two Hyperion stories, Endymion is nonetheless an interesting and satisfying read for fans of the series. While we're left guessing for the most part about the fate of the Pilgrims, we do get a fascinating sense of the depth of the Fall and it's impact on humanity. At least two very intriguing and thought-provoking twists on the ""original"" material kept me turning pages well into the night."
4,"Finally, Simmons starts moving...","Along with the interesting theological implications of his work, it seems that Simmons actually got the ball rolling in this cat and mouse chase across worlds with the Shrike making appearances from time to time as well. Very good read."
5,Endymion fails to satisfy the high expectations,"I was dissapointed by Endymion probably because of the high expectations set by the previous 2 books. Although compared with novels by other authors this is still a very good novel, I did not like the lack of imagination, simplicity of the plot and extreme resemblance of the story to well-known movies like ""Terminator 2"". There are also some weak points in the story such as it is not convincing what motivates Endymion to go into all this trouble and the insides of the Pax are too extensively described. There are no new worlds to be described and Aenea's personality reminds me more of a typical American teenager."
5,Endymion is worth every penny,"I have come to the conclusion that we readers of great writing often develop our own individual expectations for what an author's subsequent works should be like and what time line should be followed for finishing them.I think we form these expectations based in large part on how our own needs were fulfilled by the previous work(s). When these desires are not met in subsequent novels we often react a little bit beyond what might be ""objective,"" (if objectivity can legitimately be considered an attainable goal in a review).Compared to so much other stuff out there, I think Endymion ranks with the best.Perhaps Dan's story-telling speed or characters weren't the same as they were in his previous works, but does it have to be the same to make it as great a story? Personally, I think not.I like to accept the diamonds no matter how they're cut. Mr. Simmons stills takes me places I've never been, and does so masterfully. I hope he does so for a long time."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a disappointment after Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion. It started off okay, but then turned into a never-ending series of scenes where bad guys chase good guys from one planet to the next. Not much else ever happened. I felt like the author just wanted to show off the different worlds that he created. There were none of the complications to the plot that I had seen in the Hyperion books. The prophecy aspect of the story also didn't work for me. Aenea knows of some things that will happen, is fuzzy on others, but then, inconveniently enough, doesn't know what will happen on the planet of God's Grove. The logic of her foreknowledge was inconsistent and annoyed me. The characters were okay, but I also thought it odd that the real antagonist didn't appear until very close to the end. I listened to this as an audiobook and I had an interruption in my listening due to device difficulties, but even trying to take that into account, this book really didn't work for me."
2,The low point of a brilliant series,"What a mess. The first two books told a great, and complete, story. To begin this one, however, is to open a new can of worms, and invest yourself in a new set of characters -- with only a few attachments to the ones you already grew to know.That's fine -- lord knows the Dune series batted me around for a few thousand years before letting it end. But this book is little more than a chase. Two ships, chasing each other. Two VERY SLOW SHIPS chasing each other. It's like watching glaciers play tag. And, in the end, all its done is set you up for book number four.This all comes with a caveat.... the fourth book is fabulous. So -- if you want to read the fourth book, which I encourage, you'll want to swallow this one beforehand, just for the plot details, or you'll be well lost. It's quite a penalty, really... but, I swear, the last book will make it worthwhile. Really."
2,Ack!,"Simmons really dropped the ball on this one, and its follow up as well. Do yourself a huge favor and consider this series to be 2 books long and forget about Endymion and Rise of Endymion. More apt titles would have been The Dying Earth, parts 3 and 4...ha!"
5,Better than the original books,"I enjoyed Endymion even more than the first 2 Hyperion books.Written as narrative (near-omniscience of the narrative is explained in the 4th book!), the book takes a great look at life several decades after the prior characters 'ride off into the sunset'. What type of future did the Hyperion pilgrims help bring into effect? Pretty damned creepy, I'll say!If anyone enjoyed the first 2 books, the next 2 are a must."
3,A Long and Winding Road,"Simmons' Hyperion series owes a lot to both 19th century poets and authors. The length, word mastery, and character development remind me of Dickens. Unfortunately, Simmons' novels are serialized the modern way by cutting one long and superb book in two. The result is that the reader is left at the end of ENDYMION with a real feeling of incompleteness. Standing alone, the book comes across as the SF equivalent of a car chase film, and about as satisfying. However if one reads this and RISE of ENDYMION as a single novel, this ""novel"" adds immeasurably to the sequel. Read together ENDYMION and RISE OF ENDYMION, are spectacular singular achievements that propel the whole series to the highest levels of SF. Read alone, this novel leaves much to be desired."
3,Pretty good for one of a series.,"The original novel in this series, 'Hyperion', is the only 5 star book in the series (heck, even 5 1/2 stars), but this one is the second best of the series. Oh, did I mention that this book it part of a series, by the way? I can't say that this one stands out in a particular way but the entire series (there's that word again) is worth your while. But if you only read one of the series, make sure that you read the first one. It's a GREAT book.OK, not very helpful."
3,Downhill since Hyperion...,"Hyperion was one of the best books I have ever read. It was a wonderful combination of many genres of science fiction in a mixture inspired by John Keats and Geoffrey Chaucer. It turned out to be a masterpiece of science fiction. The Fall of Hyperion was disappointing, but did create a resolution. Endymion is an adventure/action tale set in the same universe. It does have it's high points (the cyborg assassin was chilling, and the journey of the main characters was interesting), but don't expect anything even as remotely fascinating as Hyperion was. Only read the first book and skip the rest."
2,Empty and useless...,"Ok, Dan Simmons is a good writer. Ok, he's got good ideas. But while reading this book, I couldn't help thinking that he's been stretching the strory he started in his first 2 excellent books far too much. The flow and pace are still mastered by Simmons, but this time there is no scenario whatsoever supporting his writing skills. We're driven from action scene to action scene in a boring stream of kitsch exotic postcards and boring dialogs. Even the Dreadful Inquisitors sound stupid and fake in Simmons's hand. Not to mention the shallowness of his main caracters... Even Rambo has more layers to his personality than poor Raul Endymion!A big deception is garanteed for those who loved Hyperion. So don't forget to put this volume in your ""Index of Prohibited Books""!"
3,I thought I wanted to go back to Hyperion...,"Taken on its own, it's a decent book. Unfortunately for this book and its sequel, it will always be compared to the original masterpieces of ""Hyperion"" and ""Fall of Hyperion"". As such it disappoints you when you're expecting the lush scene building and rich language of the originals and it provides merely adequate sci-fi. It's almost as if it were a piece of fan fiction created by someone with a deep knowlege of the Hyperion mythology.My advice, read ""Hyperion"" and ""Fall of Hyperion"" and then try some of Simmons horror works, just don't muddy your impression of his masterwork with this book."
5,biology and SF,"Cette oeuvre est excellente, je ne suis pas un critique littéraire je me contente donc de dire que j'ai adoré. J'aimerais toutefois poser une question : Dan Simmons a-t'il lu ""Le Gene Egoste"" de Richard Dawkins (""The Selfish Gene"" by R. Dawkins) pour élaborer sa théorie sur l'évolution des intelligences artificielles ?"
5,Riveting from the very first page,"This book gripped me from the very first page, and it's no disappointment right up to the end. Plenty of action. It's not as bizarre as the earlier Hyperion books, but is more of an adventure/chase story."
2,a pro written book without tru energy or vision,"I quite much liked the Hyperion story, but this book was a dissapointment. The main characters do not have much to offer, and as the plot starts to jump between plantes the novel turns into a clever adventure story. It is kind of all there, but it is not really interesting. You have heard it all before. I find the imagination easy going and in a way boring, and do not find the book comming true as a sf-vision in any way as the Hyperion story did."
4,Still not sure what I think.,So many things about this series are good and so many things bug me. I still can't decide if I really like this series.UPDATE: I reread the entire series and I've decided that I do like the series. It's reasonably well written and was pretty visionary considering when it was written. It would be awesome if he wrote more about the distant future's conflict but I also guess that it would take away some of the vague mystique of what was really happening.
1,Diminishing returns from a great series,I waited a long time to read this sequel and was hugely disappointed by it. After the brillance of Hyperion and Fall.. I expected a lot and unfortunately this just didn't live up to my expectations.
1,Not worth it,"After the first two books in the series the author should have stopped. This book does not add anything worth reading to the story. It's a sad copy of Terminator I and II mixed with Alien. It's so sad, stay with the first two books, don't even read this one."
4,"Good, but not as good as prior two.","This was a good book, but not nearly as entertaining as his prior two Hyperion adventures. It moves a little slow, but still worth reading."
3,A never-ending chase scene,"First, let me say that Hyperion / Fall of Hyperion are my favorite works of fiction. So when Endymion came out, I couldn't wait for the paperback and shelled out the dough for the hardback instead. I was very dissapointed. Although some of it was rather clever (I was particularly fond of the evolution of the church), the plot never went anywhere. It was a never-ending chase scene that wouldn't be effectively changed if several hundred pages were left out. That said, I'll probably read the next one too, just in case he decides to get on with the story..."
3,Good intermediate book in a seemingly unending anthology,"Endymion keeps with the tradition of Simmons earlier work; telling agood story without really reaching a conclusion. I've travelledwith this plot line through three books now with few signs ofresolving its major themes. Endymion is not as good as the earlierworks or maybe I am getting tired of reading without resolution.I am beginning to feel that Simmons doesn't have anend in mind and we are all just wandering through his world with eachbook.I await his next work to see how he reconciles Keats, Frank LoydWright, and the omnipresent Shrike."
4,An adventure story. . . not a work of art.,"This book lacks the complexity and literary power that I lovedin HYPERION and FALL OF HYPERION. ENDYMION appears more asa simple adventure story, although a well written one.The repercussions of the cruciform have been fleshed out sothat it forms the basis for a galactic religion and thepolitical setting for the novel. The ending was so powerfulthat it is worth the price of the book alone."
2,A waste of my time,"Unlike ""Hyperion"", my pick as the best novel ever written, and ""The Fall of Hyperion"", the best sequel ever written, ""Endymion"" fails utterly. In my view it is pop trash. I think Simmons publisher must have forced this from him, because the plot is trite and formulaic...the characters flat and boring. If you've read the series, ""Endymion"" is equivalent to ""Dying Earth 2"". Don't bother (somehow, I think the author probably feels the same way)."
2,The saga goes downhill,"Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are two of my favorite books. I really loved them. But the series goes downhill fast with Endymion and Rise of Endymion. I would recommend reading the first two, and stopping there. If you're hungry for more, read the first two again. They're that good. But Endymion and Rise of Endymion are really not on the same level."
4,My 100-word book review,"Third novel in the Hyperion Cantos, Endymion marks a change in style, providing fewer ideas but more action, as the naive eponymous hero attempts to fulfil his mission across the ruined worlds of the Hegemony. There is a new heroine (future saviour Aenea), some new enemies and a few good friends (including faithful android A. Bettik and the Consul's resourceful spaceship.) What Endymion lacks in sophistication, it compensates for with some beautifully imagined planets and its sections that deal with the Pax, a tyrannical new star empire. Even though it is weaker than the other novels, this is still quality."
5,Melito has it together,"Fr. Melito did a great job of elucidating St. Vincent's approach to life. Although somewhat unevenly, he covers some important ground."
4,Crazy Fun,"I thought this film was a real blast to watch. Mitchum is great as always. I saw this on cable a few years back, but until now haven't been able to track it down on dvd, so I'm excited to see it's finally available. The other review posted on here has more info on this strange and fun film."
3,Okay,"I got this book to get some extra practice on the problems on the test -- particularly Math section. For a book that differentiates itself with the ""800"" moniker, I felt the problems were WAY too easy for this level. I'd hate to see what the regular book is like. It didn't even deal with what are considered the hardest problems on the test -- probability and permutations & combinations. So I'd recommend this book ONLY to people who want some basic extra problems, and forgoe the regular Kaplan books altogether (although I haven't read them, and this book does NOT give any overview of math topics). You're way better off getting the official guides."
3,Just to Practice,"I used this book to practice some more to the GMAT test. My especific problems for the GMAT test lies on the reading, vocabulary and structure of it, on spot that english is not my first language. The book improve my skills on it, and seems to satisfy the objectives above. I agree that the title is too optimist for the book (GMAT 800), but think of it as a complementary self-study course. To use the official guide is a must."
3,Good,"Delivered as expected.Most of my GMAT taking friends recommended this book, so I hope it helps."
2,Mediocre attempt at hard questions,"While a good bank of hard questions, the explanations of the book do little to help you develop the skills needed to actually get an 800."
3,Hard problems not always helpful,"This book gives hard sets of questions. It does a good job explaining the answers. However, hard problems are not always what you need to study. This book does not give any practice tests so you won't know how you do on the real exam. This means that you may never even get to the hard questions on the real GMAT if you can't do the simple ones--therefore, this book would be a waste of your time. The verbal section is excellent though. The math is lacking."
2,PRODUCT WASN'T MEANT FOR MY COROLLA TRIM CE MODEL,"this product was returned because it didn't fit my corolla trim CE model.LeBra Front End Cover Toyota Corolla - Vinyl, Black"
3,Surpringsly OK,"I was a little skeptical upon purchasing this but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works. On the minus side, the battery does pop out of the holder sometimes but once it is secured firmly in the battery holder, it does charge.On the plus side, it comes with a car charger adapter that works great for those times when you've forgotten to charge the battery and can do so from the car on the way to a venue."
2,Digital Mini charger fo CRV3 batteries,I did not get the electrical plug with my charger all I got was the car charger :-( Otherwise it works wonderful
2,Warning: Don't Recharge,"Be aware that many of the CR-V3 batteries have a small printed warning that says"" DO NOT RECHARGE"". This is the case for my Olympus Camedia CR-V3 battery."
1,Worst ever,This doll is the worse doll i have ever played with in my whole intire life and i have played with alot of crappy dolls. this one is the worse of all. these dolls are not anything like barbie. i think matell is desprate for money becuase they are making dolls like street hookers. my freind loves these dolls and she says she wants to grow up to be just like one. i would not want to grow up living like one. I would not recomend these dolls to anyone who wants to live a normal life
1,God theyre scary!,"They look like sluts!They are so ugly!Kids are bad enough these days....what does mattel want to do,encourage them?When I was little,I had cute barbies who looked like girls wanting to have fun.Now they are like ""Dress like a slut and youll be cool.""Come on!I do recommend Bratz though and if your younger than six,a baby doll is great fun.Or my little ponys!Not flavas though!"
2,WHATEVER!,BARBIES ARE SUPERFICIAL AND BRATZ AERE SOOOO MUCH BETTER. THEY R SOO CUTE WHILE BARBIE IS JUS A WANNABE NOW. WITH ALL HER FAKE SMILES AND HER SILLY-LITTLE MAGICAL PEGASUS!! BARBIES STINK AN I THINK THE LIL POOR PEGASUS MIGHT JUS FAINT FROM HER ODOR!! BRATZ ROX MY SOXX!! BARBIES ARE SOO TOTALLY EWW!
2,BRATZ RULE BARBIES DRULE(AT LEAST THIS FLAVAS COMES UNDER BARBIE SO ITS COUNTED),BARBIES ARE RASCISTS!! I AGREE WITH ONE LADY WHO SAID SUMTHING ABOUT THE DOLL'S HAIR AND BEYONCE THINGY. BRATZ ARE BETTER!! THEY ARE NOT RASCIST. EVERYONE SHOULD BE TREATED EQUALLY AND FAIRLY NO MATTER WHAT RACE YOU R FROM.
1,Stunningly horrendous,"I have never seen a line of dolls as horrible as Mattel's Flava collection, but this doll is the worst. This doll is beyond insulting to African American women and girls -- it's racist, ""black-face"". Clearly Mattel thinks Black women are all hookers!"
4,Great transitional learning bike,"My 4yo already had a tricycle that he loved, but this one has helped him learn to transition from the trike to the bike. Learning to balance isnt quite so difficult, plus the fact that its light in weight makes it a little easier too (not even remotely as heavy as the metal bikes with training wheels). It took a few times to get used to it, but now he loves it. And if he's happy, I'm happy!"
1,Bad Design,We put this on our wish list and Grandparents bought it for our son for Christmas. Our 3-year-old didn't like it at all. It is poorly designed. The rear wheels when in the trike position wobble around and make it very hard to peddle. We believe this is because the rear axle does not extend through the entire wheel shaft when in the trike position. Our 4 year old who peddles very well on other bikes and trikes could not ride it either. It was very frustrating as this was an item we were hoping would allow our 3 year old to ride around with his older brothers. We will be returning this item in order to get another ride on toy!
1,Don't buy this cheaply made trike,"The wheels are made of a hard plastic that does not grip any surface, the body is made of a thin plastic that will surely break in no time, and the pedals have such a small turning circumference that spinning the pedals a bunch of times still isn't enough to get you anywhere.This was very frustrating for our 3-year old, and us, and will be returned ASAP. Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS!!"
3,Not Great,"I bought this bike for my 2 1/2 year old to use as a trike. It was very easy to put together, light weight, and has an adjustable seat. He loves the bike; however he is not strong enough to pedal -He's 38 inches and 33lbs. The bike is designed only to have one back wheel move, and since it is so light weight he can not get it to move. I think I should have bought him a small two-wheel bike w/ training wheels instead."
1,Pass on this one.,"I was very excited when we received this trike for my child. After 6 months, my 3 year old was still unable to ride it well. After reading the reviews, we realized the issue was the trike. We ended up throwing this one away and getting her a bike. Don't waste your money."
3,exasperating experience,We purchased this bike last year for our 3 year old. The pedals were hard for him to push on his own and he would get extremely upset. The bike is durable and the right size it just is too hard for a little kid to push the pedals. We ended up leaving it at grandmas when we moved. He doesn't even miss it.
2,Unhappy NYC Mom,"I bought this bike thinking it would be a good starter for my toddler daughter to learn how to ride. It is simply to put up, but it is difficult for her to push the pedals. I was not happy with this merchandise. I think for my daughter to learn I will get the bike that I push with the handle and when she gets the hang off it take the handle off so she can do it on her own. I say to look around before you purchase this bike."
2,Easily tips over,My 2 year old is rather short. Right away I knew this bike was way too big for her. It took a long time to put together but is not stable. The rears wheels do not fit properly and wobble. In the trike position she was constantly tipping it. There are way too many options on the market to waste on this bike. I'm now left searching for something she can use!
4,Great intro to 3D graphics!,"This is a really good intro to the fundamentals of 3D graphics. The best thing about this book is that it is API-neutral, and so covers the material wihtout making specific references to API's. The material is explained very clearly and is easy to read. I would have liked some more guidance on actual implementation in code (e.g. using C to make it accessible to most readers, or using pseudo-code). Perhaps some canned demo programs would have been nice, to supplement the narrative.I also bought Hill's book on 3D graphics with OpenGL(2nd Edition), and find the two books work quite well together.I recommend Shirley's book as a first introduction to graphics theory >before< you start playing with an API!"
5,Idea's are presented very clearly. Extremely east to read for a textbook,This was the required textbook for my graphics class at PSU and I have to say it is one of the better texts I've read over the years. Most chapters aren't too long and all of the ideas are very well presented.I'd highly recommend this book to those interested in studying computer graphics and would like a short review of the background mathematics behind it.
4,"Good book, but beware the reflection algorithm","All and all I've been very pleased with this book, however, do not trust the reflection algorithm in the ray tracer chapter. It should be a minus, not a plus."
2,hard to follow the author,"I did my undergrad in UC Berkeley and work at Google. I teach myself lots of stuffs by reading books.This book is hard to follow. The author doesn't state the context clearly and his assumptions. As as result, you spend most of your time figuring out them rather than the materials. For this reason I give it two stars.I think this book assumes you have a strong math background. It presents you the formulas but doesn't try to explain why the formulas are so."
5,great graphics book,"This book covers many different areas of computer graphics , and it's great starting point for it's exploring."
1,"Very boring, written unclearly","I vehemently dislike this textbook. The math is unclear or not well explained, and it makes Graphics seem like a stale, formulaic, and unattractive subject. Note, however, that I have only read the first several chapters. I don't plan on reading any more."
4,Excellent musicianship throughout,"I enjoyed this CD very much, but I was somewhat puzzled by some of the music choices in relation to the title. With a title like 'Stars & Stripes' I would expect to hear American marches and other patriotic music. Instead, there is a mix of American and European marches and fanfares, along with well-loved selections by Grainger and Vaughn Williams. I adore 'Lincolnshire Posy', having played it in college, and this rendition is done very well. I'm just not sure how it fits in with the rest of the album."
1,Beware This Is In PAL format,"While the Amazon product desription states that this is in NTSC format & all regions, this DVD is actually in PAL format and will NOT play in the United States."
5,Great book went over exactly what I needed,"This is an easy to understand book that went over everything that I needed to know. I'm pretty hard on book reviews as if I have to know the language before I learn about it then the book was a waste of time. I've just given up on one more book that has that same failing. I started a job where I quickly needed to learn PHP and MySQL. Because of this book (and that PHP and MySQL aren't that difficult to understand), I was able to learn these technologies quickly enough to finish my project on time. Can't beat that."
4,PHP and MySQL Web Dev is better than average,"Not a bad book. It covers a little more that the basics but doesn't get real deep, and for my needs that was good. I wanted to find several books I could give to my entry-level programmers that would provide them with an extra reference. All in all it was a good addition to our class library."
3,not that great,"I was catched by the hype ""best book"" and so on, so now I'm reading it, though i'm only on page 200, but still the book isn't so great. Sometimes I think I'd better read PHP online manual, but not the book (now I'm reading both), because authors sometimes misleadingly present information. For example with __set() and __get() methods in the class, authors claim that these methods are always implicitly invoked when setting the value, but PHP manual clearly states ""These methods will only be triggered when your object or inherited object doesn't contain the member or method you're trying to access"".Chapter about objects is very weak, I wonder if I hadn't previous experience with Java, I guess I wouldn't understand at all what objects and classes are, what they do, how they do it and so on.Overall I can't judge if the book is better or worse than other PHP books, this is my first on the subject, so I give it a 3 stars.I wish Bruce Eckel would write a book on PHP :)"
2,Hihgly Over-Rated !,"I bought this book primarily because of the impressive reviews. After struggling with the book for months, I now feel that others' reviews of the book were too generous. First of all, the book needs to be better organized.And the codes need to be thoroughly tested.The content is lean, compared to the volume of the book. I tried several other PHP tutorial books, but I have not yet found one which met my expectations. This is just my two cents."
5,Book Order,"This book was ordered for an evening class at a local college. I was able to easily locate the book using the ISBN and placed the order, which included free shipping. The book arrived on schedule and in excellent condition. I definitely would order through Amazon.com again. Thanks"
3,"Have it, don't use it much","I don't have a real reason for not using it other than everything I've wanted to do I could find decent examples on the web. So to be fair, I don't know if it's a good book or not. Thus the middle of the road 3 star rating."
2,Not that great,"I had hoped this book would help me with my site, but much of the code DOES NOT WORK. At least with my setup of PHP 4.4, MySQL 4 and MS IIS. You can get all this information and more just by searching the internet. What a waste of money."
2,Review of _Attack of the Super Monsters_,"Read about this on the Bad Movie Website and just had to see it for myself. I don't know how much was lost in translation from the Japanese, but am well aware that most anime - like most of anything else - is mediocre. This is just south of mediocre.The DVD is a good copy, both visually and aurally. However, what it's copying may not have been worth the effort.It's worth viewing to see how multiple techniques - cell animation, stop-motion animation and live action with guys in rubber monster suits - were integrated, but otherwise give it a miss."
2,Attack of the bad movie,"I'm a big fan of giant monster movies and shows ""Godzilla, Ultraman"" and was very disappointed with this movie. Dinosaurs have survived for millions of years below the Earth's surface. They have become more intelligent than humans and have decided to take back the surface annihilating all humans in the process. The only thing that can stop them is a group of four super-powered teenagers ""two of them look like old men in their 60's"". The younger male and female can somehow combine themselves to become one cyborg being/vehicle called Gemini to fight the ""terrifying"" monsters. The movie is a mixture of live action, suitmation & animation. The animation is very crude, the rubber-suited monster are worse than what you see in Ultraman, and the live action is something out of the Thunderbirds. I believe the film was originally a tv show that a few of the episodes were combined to make this 83 minute movie, so there really isn't any satisfying conclusion to the story."
1,So absolutely terrible that you just MUST see it!,"I knew when I picked this title up that it was going to be BAD, i just wanted to see just how bad it could get. I never expected, however, the despairingly comic disaster that this movie is. What in the name of heck were these people thinking when they made this!? Anyhow, due to being just SO BAD that it defies belief, this video will always have a very special place in my movie collection."
2,Season 2 Sadly SUCKS!,"I'm not crazy about how they are selling these Seasons in multiple volumes, but when they delete the segways it's enough for me to want a refund. Maybe they will fix this in a future release. Would not buy."
5,reliable seller,"I purchased a set from another seller(tv dvd)and they were a rip-off.They were it turns out a chinese knock-off that either froze,skipped or didn't work at all.I then paid more to Amazon but received what I wanted-quality and complete satisfaction.This is a very reliable place to purchase."
5,Just sit back and enjoy...,"With all due respect, I would not worry about the reviewer who was not pleased with Season 2, Volume 1 of ""The Untouchables""...Just sit back and enjoy the well written shows. I think the quality in the second season actually surpasses the first! Watch for a cameo by a very young Ryan O'Neil. These are fun to watch...lots of good acting...so, as I suggest, just sit back and enjoy."
5,A hit with my kid...,"We arranged for my 4-year-old daughter to get this from Santa at a Christmas party recently. It's not quite what I expected for the money... we can't get the dog's slippers to stay on her feet and the bubbles come out in tiny spurts. Having said that, however, I must tell you that those things don't seem to matter at all to my daughter. She absolutely loves it. She plays with it more than any other toy she owns. She loves to take the dog with her when she takes her bath and even insists on making a bed for shampoochie next to her own bed every night(the dog is perpetually wet from all the bathing so she can't sleep in my daughter's bed). So, I guess my opinion has to be tempered by the joy shampoochie has brought to her owner. I can't imagine a little girl not loving this."
3,Not bad for the price,"I purchased the hoslter for a .357 mag . held it really good , not bad on the draw , but it was hard on the shoulders and it kept dragging down on me . i would say its a good Hoslter for the price but not for a heavy gun ."
3,Techno shneeelalala,"techno music is good. all these people put a bunch of crap in their review. well i like techno music, so buy it"
2,Buyer Beware: Only Half the Songs,"I've wanted this collection for a long time, but was put off by the prospect of paying full price. When I saw it on sale at Target, I gladly plunked down $14, only to find out later that this version has only one CD and therefore only half the songs advertised on TV. More specifically, most of the songs I wanted were on the second CD which isn't available separately yet. I don't know if Music Space intends to release the second CD soon."
1,Spikenvixen,"I'll have to agree with ""Disappointed"" and ""Buyer Beware"" - this is NOT the ""Fired Up"" advertised on TV. Nor have I seen this compilation in ANY store as one disk! I don't believe it should be marketed as ""Fired Up"". It's false advertising! The music is good, but I am extremely disappointed...I could have paid the same amount in a store and received BOTH CDs!"
4,Old songs alert!,"That was what I was thinking when mum bought me this album when she and dad was in the US a week ago. It's a nice collection of dance hits from the end of the 90's and the beginning of 2000's. One thing I noticed though, was that the Hex Hector Radio Mix of Melanie C's ""I Turn To You"" had a much harder sound than the radio mix that is on the european single and I also noticed the piano parts and strings from the original is featured in the radio mix on this compilation. The bassline also stays more true to the original version. Apparently Hex did two radio mixes, one for the US and one for Europe. The other songs are a fun ""blast from the past""-experience, and this album is a great party warm-up."
5,Excellent!!,"I am a product of the disco era, these are the greatest songsall put on a cd. Obviously there are alot more, and I welcome the idea that those would be put on a CD also.Crank it up high and dance, dance, dance."
4,Good Dancing,"Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I was a baby when these songs first came out so this has nothing to do with nostalgia. I just like the songs. Some are very catchy and I like to dance to them. There are a few clunkers (like Insomnia) but the good outweighs the bad."
5,Fires me UP!,"If you were dancing at disco techs in the 90s, this album will bring back tons of memories. I really can't think of a better name for the compilation...'cause this album sure fires me up!"
4,Mostly Good,"This CD has many good songs, however, there are also a few songs that seem like filler. Overall the CD was good. Just get rid of the fluff"
4,I like it!,"I had no idea there was a 2 disc version until I was looking for a song title for a friend tonight. I purchased the single disc version at a store earlier this year and it has been a constant in my gym bag ever since. It's got consistant enough beats to make a workout go by quickly and when set on random play it varies the workout enough to keep me from getting bored.For those who are complaining about the disc length, check the song list before purchasing. That's a dead giveaway that it's a single disc."
2,Disappointed :(,This is not the 2 cd set I though I was getting. Is is 1 cd. The CD case says AS SEEN ON TV but the one on musicspace.com has 2 cd's. Im angry!! Now I have to sell this CD to get the right one! 1st expierance on Amazon and my last. I'll go back to Ebay.
3,Get Stricly Commercial instead,"This is Zappa, so it is all good. This is a compilation where the producers have basically taken the older (and better) 'best of' compilation 'Strictly Commercial' and deleted 1/3 of the tracks to make it a sweet 16 compilation.This is all PG-13 Zappa, a good introduction, but there is no need for it since you can still find ""Strictly Commercial""."
3,A GOOD BOOK FOR,"the uninitiated. However, if you're older and/or learned the hard way to develop social skills I'd skip this book. I did give a copy to my daughter who needs all the hlep she can get, but doubt she will read it."
3,"""What Does Everybody Else Know That I Don't?""","The title is too long, especially for anyone with AD/HD. The book is helpful but focus is difficult to maintain....which may not be the author's fault as much as the target demographic's inherent problem set. Still it is a worthwhile addition for anyone with AD/HD seeking to understand why simple social events are so often filled with anxiety and disappointment."
2,Not very helpful,"The author reviews the types of behaviors that many of those with ADHD do that gets them in trouble. Also listed are many of those things that they do not but should. With the former, most of the advice provided by this author seems to consist of saying such and such behavior will land you in hot water. So don't do it. But there is little advice on how to go about modifying your behavior. Perhaps this book might be useful for kids but most adults have figured out for example that blurting things out in an undiplomatic manner will get them in trouble. But to just stay stop it is silly and useless advice."
5,Author provides spectacular insight in easy to read format,"I recently finished reading Michele Novotni's groundbreaking book, ""What does everybody else know that I don't?"" The book provides very useful and practical insights that can be applied to the everyday life of a person with ADD. Although the ideas and concepts are brilliant, Novotni manages to tailor the messages so that an average reader can understand them. I reccomend that anyone who wants to improve their relationships with others read this book."
2,Some good info,"Good informational book, however it's written by someone who does not have ADHD. I found the majority of the information overwhelming and hard to implement by someone who actually does have ADHD."
5,This book is a vital addition to the ADD 'library'.,This reader friendly guide to developing social skills has been a blessing to my family. Michelle Novotni has provided many long awaited answers to chronic problem areas at home and in the workplace. It has brought structure and hope into our lives. I bought several more copies to share with friends and family.
3,Might be useful,"This unique book attempts to explain how ADD symptoms affect other peoples' feelings and view of the person with ADD, and how to adjust behavior to improve relationships. There's probably some valuable information in this book for anyone whose ADD has created friction, but it's not always easy to pick out what applies. It's occasionally condescending and a bit wordy. Other than that, the intro contains some really important basics, and the rest of the book is divided into specific problem areas."
5,"Good album, WAY OVERPRICED!",This is a good album - I have it located with my favorites shelf of CDs.This CD though can be found for more than half the price at other music sources.
2,Hero Worship from a Distance,"Interesting story about one man's rise from the porch of poverty to the mansions of Beverly Hills. The story is well researched and well reported, but it seems that Geffen is a hero to the author, and there is a positive slant placed on almost all his actions. The actions of his rivals are seen almost always in a negative light.The choice for references was kind of strange to me, too, including long quotes from ""Queer in America.""This shows the work of a hero-worshipping author writing from afar. One who sat down with David Geffen and spent time and effort to interview and understand the man might come up with a much different, and much better, work."
4,Fun read,"One of the things I liked about this book was that the author occasionally made attempts to understand the man that David Geffen has become by describing the path that took him there starting with his childhood experiences. What I was interested in was how a Brooklyn kid coming from an apparently modest background could rise to the top. I wanted to know what kept him going. This book was a good start. Unlike several other books on entertainment moguls, it provided more than an overview of historical facts, by quoting interviews with people who personally knew Geffen."
1,Singular fails again.,"I bought the book without knowing that its author, S. Singular, is also responsible for a work on M. Ovitz- which received almost uniformly bad critics. It probably won`t be different with this title. Once again, no personal contact to Geffen was established; Singular simply presents a potpourri of well- known facts, mixed with sentences like ""when he (Geffen) wanted Sex, he found it"". The interview Geffen gave Playboy magazine in `94 is more informative than this scrappy Singular product. I strongly advise against buying this book."
1,Big Mess,"I have a couple different retractable items for my Media Player, however these headphones do not work the same way. They were horrible. They are not secure feeling in their mechanics, and the wire stripped when I tried to pull them out the 2nd time. Basically they broke immediately. My boyfriend thought I was kidding, but he said he agrees... major design flaws. Most retractable earbuds I find get the same review. If they pull from a wheel in the middle, they are no good. They tangle up when you pull them out, and there is no going back."
3,Strange way to lay out a CD,"This CD is only 4 different Beethoven pieces, but each is performed three different ways.. it's weird. I end up having to skip around or change out the CD all the time."
1,yuck!,"I am a huge fan of Adagio teas and of their Rooibos tea and this was DISGUSTING. I was so disappointed. I was expecting a smooth, sweet, creamy treat and - well, yuck!It literally tastes like something your doctor gives you to drink before a colonoscopy or some sort of medical procedure involving a radioactive scan. I couldn't drink more than two sips of it and it turned me off from tea for a few days.Unless you are a hardcore fan of chocolate tea and Rooibos tea, skip it. I love tea and I love chocolate (I love both in an obsessive way- can't get enough of either) but they just don't go well. It sounds like they would, but unless you *know* you enjoy chocolate teas, skip this one.Blech!"
5,Wonderful,"This tea was amazing, and I don't really like tea. It has a chocolate mint flavor that was wonderfully refreshing."
2,TOO LOUD!,"We were giving this monitor as a gift since we have a two story house, with the thought that we can have one parent unit in our room and one downstairs for when the baby is sleeping. Well, it is great for downstairs, because I can hear him all the way in the kitchen at the lowest volume setting (the unit is in the livingroom), but the one that is in our bedroom is SOOOO loud that even on the lowest setting, we still have to wrap it in several towels to keep it from not rattling us from a dead sleep everytime the baby rolled over! Even after we put several towels on top of the child's unit, it is still excessively loud. I contacted the company and they said there is nothing that can be done to adjust the sound levels."
3,Junk after 3-6 mos!!,"I got one of these as a baby shower gift, I loved it for about 3 mos., then it started to get all kinds of static AND one of the remote units stopped working totally. So I figured it was just THIS one and went and bought another set. Well this one after around 5 mos. is starting to do the same thing. I think I'll try a different brand name this time."
3,GREAT until it's TERRIBLE,We loved this monitor for 18 months. It was perfectly crystal clear and had great range in our 3 story house. Then all of a sudden it got horribly staticky in both receivers at the same time. We had to stop using it because the static is so loud. We are mourning it's loss because it was great while it lasted.
3,Great monitor but did not last long,"I loved this Graco monitor. The sound is very clear, no static or any other noises, but unfortunately it did not last even 2 years! I thought that being a Graco I could have it forever and use it for my next baby, but I was wrong. I talked to customer service at Graco, and they were very nice and polite but since the warranty was over there was not much to do anymore."
3,Liked It but found better.,I have used this monitor for three years with my daughter I currently have another baby on the way. The monitor is great when plugged in we live by the lake so whenever my daughter would take a nap I would go to the beach and the monitor would always die it does not have a long battery life. This monitor is great if you are going to leave it plugged in all the time.I recently broke down and spent the money on a summer hand held video monitor this goes up to 1200 feet! we have been testing it out and well worth the money.
2,sure it's clear.... when it works,I am so upset with this monitor. Last night I woke up to my son crying bloody murder because he had been waiting for who know how long for me to go feed him. It took so long because my monitor died on me once again. I have the monitor on at night only for a total of maybe 6 hours. I put a new battery in it on Sunday night. Last night it wasn't working anymore. This is unacceptable to me. I count on the monitor to hear my son and this failed.
1,junk!!!,"This is the worst item possible for parents of an infant! Waking up to the loud horrible static noise this thing makes was extremely unsettling. I tried everything possible to eliminate the static, but to no avail. I recommend everyone really research monitors, they are one of the most important baby items you get."
5,Graco Ultraclear monitor is great.,"I have a newborn as well as a two year old and wanted a monitor that wouldn't interfere with the other I already had. I tried a couple only to return them. Then, I purchased the Angelcare monitor by Bebe that costs $100. While that one worked, I was going nuts trying to remember to turn off the motion sensor on it every time I got the baby out of bed. So, I went to the store and bought the Graco Ultraclear and have been extrememly pleased. It does not interfere with my older son's monitor or the other electronics in the house, including the phone. It has very clear reception and I absolutely love the fact that there are dual receivers. I definitely recommend this monitor."
2,not as good as other brands,"too sweet. Tastes artificial. Will go back to the brand from France, L'autre tea. Also the tea is chopped almost to dust making it fall through my tea ball and mesh basket"
5,2409 Magnetic Towel Bar,Very good product - I tried using it the very first day and was not disappointed. The magnet is very strong and there is no problem installing and removing towel. I would highly recommend this product!
3,Magnetic double towel bar,I am disppointed that there is not enough room for two towels. Magnet works just fine. Have it placed on my refrigerator. I would still recommend it.
1,I don't like this towel bar,"I have had this towel bar for 6 months or so. It worked fine on my dishwasher, but I got a new dishwasher and was afraid the magnets would leave marks on it, so I moved it to the side of my refrigerator. My refrigerator has a more ""textured"" surface. Anyway, it won't stay in place. It continuously slides down. I will throw it away as soon as I find something to replace it with. It isn't worth a dime!!"
3,an alternative,"Levolor Kirsch W7004213100 Magnetic Rod Set, 16 to 28-Inch Width, WhiteEnough people didn't like this towel rack, that I was afraid to buy it. I decided to look for a magnetic curtain rod instead, and recently bought 2 at my local Target. Although they carried the Target brand name(I think: Room Essentials)?...the rods I bought look just like the ones above ... and are working fine as towel rods on the side of the stove and dishwasher."
2,meh,"Wanted to love this towel bar. Really needed it to work. Alas, one of the magnets was super weak and the bar ended up on the floor daily. Tried to fortify it with another magnet underneath it but no luck. Threw it away."
3,Slowly slides down fridge.,"I love the idea of this product, because I too have no room for a towel rack. The magnets on the product seem very strong, however it very slowly slides down the fridge, even without being touched. I never see it moving but I wake up every morning and have to slide it back up a few inches. If I put 2 towels on it like they show in the picture, then it slides even faster. I did give it 3 stars because even with the annoying sliding I will keep this product. I need a towel rack, and like I said it seems really strong when I pull on it, so I am not sure what causes the sliding. I would not put this product on the front of my stainless steel fridge, just in case the sliding causes marks (it hasn't yet.)"
3,Does not stay on a textured surface,"When I first got this towel bar and put it on my refrigerator door, it worked well. But, when I moved it to the side of the refrigerator, it kept sliding down to the floor when I put the towel on. I then realized that the finish on the door is smooth while the side is textured and the magnets are not strong enough to make it stay put. Too bad, I really wanted it to work."
5,"Great product, works like a charm!","The bar arrived yesterday, and I put it on my fridge to try it out. It works great! I like having a towel bar that I can position on the fridge out of reach of my cat, who likes to pull towels down if I drape them over the oven handle.I don't understand the nonsense reviews about the magnets not sticking; it must be an issue with the surfaces that the magnets are adhering to, because these are really strong magnets!The only improvement I would suggest is to make the bar a little wider. The bar isn't wide enough to place a dish towel on it without folding it in half. I use the front bar for a folded towel, and the back one (which is a little narrower) for a small dish cloth.I'm a happy customer!"
5,Clings hard to my fridge,"It's perfect for my needs. It does not slip & slide around, as I've read in some other reviews. It stays put and holds my towels. I like the way it holds the towel out away from the fridge for a quicker drying. End of my story."
1,Will scratch your fridge!!!,The sharp plastic edges on this magnetic towel bar scratched my brand new fridge. The magnets are not strong enough to keep it from moving and scratching the surface it is mounted on.
3,Good product,The towel bar doesn't slip and it is a great overall product. The reason for 3 stars is because it is constructed for one towel despite its description. The bars are too close to each other and would not allow for two normal-sized kitchen towels to dry.
3,Losing Strength?,"When I first received this product, I *loved* it. It stuck to my fridge next to the sink, and held the dishtowels right where I needed them. Yes it's not wide, but I didn't want it any wider. I haven't had any issues with it scratching the fridge as others have...but suddenly it keeps sliding. I will follow up if it somehow is a fluke!I really want to love this, if I can just get the magnets back up to their original strength..."
4,Thank You,Great way to get a towel rod by my kitchen sink. I've lived for years with no towel. This great little gadget (with heavy duty magnets) really works.
3,OK for the Money,"Pros: Very strong magnets keep the towel bar in place. No assembly required; just stick on any metal appliance.Cons: Although this item is called a ""double towel bar,"" it is really small and projects only about 2.5"" from whatever it is attached to. Although it is technically possible to hang a folded dish cloth on the little bar behind the main bar, it will always touch the towel in front of it, so not practical for hanging wet and dry items at the same time.I would have paid more for a nicer one if I could have found one. Meantime, this one will suffice for a while."
4,Great but description needs an update,"I have used this journal in the past, and really like the way it is set up. Th problem is, the current description states that it is spiral bound, but it is not. I contacted the author and he said that on the last printing the binding was changed. I much prefer the spiral binding, easier to use, can add notes, clippings, and articles and the binding doesn't break. Hopefully the next printing it will be back to the spiral binding."
3,ok journal,this is a nice journal but not enough space to write what is needed to write the lines needed to be less .
5,Great Giggler Book!,My 3 kids laughed through this whole book! They say it is just like me when I talk to my sister.
2,Review,I was upset to see that it was written out to another and signed by the author. I bought it because the author was coming to school and it could not be used since it was already signed to another person.
3,Wasn't as what I expected,"I was really excited to receive this coat, since it looked really nice in the picture and previous customers had said it was warm and good. When I got this, part of the coat's inside fur started falling out, and it produced lots of lint that stuck onto my shirt. Also, the sleeves were really big. It is also ""boxy"", and since I have a really small waist, it makes me look like I have a huge stomach. The thing about sizing is that you should buy your size. I guess I wasn't sure, so I went with buying a Large (thinking I'll be wearing a sweater or something big underneath), when I'm normally a small-medium. It's not bad if the coat fits you perfectly, but the quality isn't all that fantastic.I guess, for the price, its worth it for a normal faux shearling jacket"
4,"Very cute, concise basics in 57 min","The main menu consists of a min or two on faking confidence in communication apprehension, using supporting materials, organizing your presentation (comparisons, persuading the audience including Monroe's), delivering the speech, style of speech (clarity, rhythm, parallel wording) & the delivery, the moment of truth closing (body apearance, language, eye contact, vocal varation.)I did learn a few things since I did not take public speaking in high school nor in college. It was very easy to follow with included exadurated almost silly presentation examples to every point they taught, but never allowing it to be too moronic.I rented this at my library, be sure to check yours."
4,Very nice for your little Princess,"By 2 year old received this as a christmas present. It is really cute. She loves pushing it around with or without the barbie doll(does not include the doll). The music can get a little annoying especially if your trying to have a converstion, but it's well worth it. She loves it. I've seen a lot of other toys around that are much more annoying that this. The only complaint I have is the packaging. They actually stitched the mane onto a piece of plastic. It was a total pain to get that off. It's bad enough that the toys these days come with 100's of twisty ties to undo, let alone sewing hair to a piece of plastic(who thinks of these things!) espeically when a 2 year old is anxiously waiting for you to put it together! She was very happy with the toy once we finally got it out of the box. Over all I would definatley recommend it."
5,My Daughter LOVES It!!!,"I got my daughter this Disney Princess Enchanted Tales Musical Carousel Coach toy for her third birthday and she absolutely loves it!!! Her two favorite gifts were this and the PowerWheels Mustang for the backyard. She puts her princesses and Barbies in this coach and drives them around the house! The music does get annoying, but she LOVES it. Whenever I turn it off, she turns it back on. The coach does a nice job staying attached to the horse. But, she can remove it if she wants one of her dolls to just ride the horse. The horse has wheels (which I wish other horses had) which make it move around nicely. Overall, this is a completely worthwhile toy and I have found the Amazon price to be the fairest!"
3,Fairly durable,My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and played with it a couple of days but the problem is the princesses do no fit inside the coach becuase their knees do not bend. Didn't take long for myn 3 yr old to lose interest and just play with the castle.
5,A Most Terrific Disc!!!,"This recording is, as far as I am concerned, by far the most outstanding rendition of the two selections available. Sir Charles Mackerras and The Prague Chamber Orchestra present these pieces exactly as Mozart would have preferred, if he had a chance. When the composer calls for ""Allegro con spirito,"" they floor the gas pedal. When ""Andante"" is called for, they gently apply the brakes.Ein Kleine Nachtmusik was originally written with five movements, but one was somehow misplaced, and only four have made it through the generations. This old chestnut is one of Mozart's most beloved works.The ""Posthorn"" Serenade is seven glorious movements, and is named for the Posthorn Solo, a feature of the sixth movement expertly crafted by the soloist, Zdenek Tylsar.This CD will bring over an hour of beautiful music professionally delivered to your ears. Don't hesitate! Get it now!"
4,Wait until the dust settles,"Of course neo-conservatives and the pro-war left will chant at me that the world has changed since the US/UK entente acted bilaterally and did not approach the UN for a second resolution on Iraq. Save your breath! I've heard it all before...When the dust settles and there is a world realignment, the realist tendencies of states will again rise to dominate IR. You can even quote me on it.I'm sure the framers of NAFTA and the FTAA had just these ideas in mind. Students of IPE: take notes!"
2,"Rhythm Band Claves, Deluxe Rosewood","This was, a very disappointing, experience. Instead of the Rhythm Band Claves,Deluxe Rosewood, I received Danmar Rosewood Claves, and, was told, they werethe same. The Photo,deceives You, showing two pair, of Claves. I thinking, theywere, two small pair, was disappointed, wrongly receiving, one eight inch, pair.Not, to go through, the hassle, of returning them, I reluntantly, accepted them."
2,Does not fit all bikes,"As far as the kickstand itself goes, it's solid and does the job.I just wanted to make a warning to those considering getting it: you might want to check it out in a bike shop first and see if it works with your bike.I got one, and it doesn't fit properly on my Cannondale Quick.When I try to use the bracket, the screw provided is not long enough to fully screw into the bottom stand.Also the kickstand will cut into the gear cables that run along the frame of the bike in that area, which is something I think you would want to avoid. If you use the bracket, it cuts into the cable for the front derailer. The main portion of the kickstand cuts into the cable for the rear derailer."
1,Cheap Kickstand,"Here is the problem with this product. You need to really tighten down the nut to keep the kickstand from loosening and swiveling around when you try to extend it to support the bike. When you tighten it enough to stop it from moving when you try to use it, the bracket breaks. That is what happend when I tried to install the product. When that happened it decided to remove the identical kickstand from my wife's bike and install it on my son's bike. When I turned over her bike to remove it, I saw that the kickstand on her bike (same product) was broken in the exact same place, but still somehow connected to the bike. This product is under-engineered. Now I have to go through the trouble of boxing it, taking it to the post office, mailing it back. Not worth it. Don't buy it."
4,Does the Job,"Does the intended job with no problem. Did need to be cut to work properly, but a $$ hacksaw did the trick."
4,"Basic, Does the Trick","This worked well on my wife's mountain bike, she'd been wanting a kickstand for a long time. Good construction, easy to install."
4,worked great,The kick stand worked well and fit my bike. It could have been better if it were 1/2 shorter so my bike don't stand as straight as it's now. I had to sand it down a little. They could also add a rubber coating to the clamp so it would not damage the paint.
2,Doesn't fit,When i looked this up online a thought this was a decent kickstand. Well it is but it just won't fit on my diamondback response sport. I recommend all you buyers to double check your bike size before buying this product.
4,"Item Works as Expected, Good Quality and Inexpensive","The phone does as described. Its nothing special, but is good to have just in case something happens to the cell phone. The caller id works fine and the volume is okay on the phone."
4,"pretty good, but can be aggravating","I use this with my Manfrotto mono-pod, it works pretty good, but at times it won't slide in easily,I have to jiggle it a little and work it around before it will go in.I would suggest buying the Giottos Quick Release Adapter and saving your $$$!"
5,A must have,"We use a lot of different types of video gear and we use a bunch of these pieces for our sliders, crane and Glidecam. We abuse the crap out of them and they hold up for a years... We have had two break but for the abuse giving it is expected."
3,Not made for DSLR Video,"I use my Canon 7Ds for video. With all the moving around, it's important the camera is tight on the tripod head, steadicam, etc. If you look on the right side of the base plate you'll see a nob that you turn to tighten the grip on the plate. Imagine a DSLR on this contraption, with a steadicam merlin plate below. As you turn that nob on the right to tighten the camera down, the nob will hit the steadicam plate below, stopping it from tightening; or, that nob will hit the base of the DSLR up above, stopping it from tightening. It's really annoying, but you can usually get it to tighten somewhat but not great."
1,Terrible Experience.,"I bought this quick release plate for my shoulder rig, that way I would no longer have to switch plates when changing from my tripod to my shoulder rig. When I mounted this on my 7d I realized that not only is it incredibly unstable but you cannot tighten the knob when its mounted to the 7d (it hits the bottom of the camera as it would any wide camera). After I realized this I quickly took it off expecting to put it back in it's box and send it back to Amazon. However, of course it decided to break into five pieces leaving little metal scraps and bolts scattered along the floor. Just an overall terrible experience, and I highly advise against purchasing this product. For $50, this is nothing more than an overpriced piece of junk. I expected more of Manfrotto, but alas their like any other cooperation, cutting corners, and raising prices. Don't waste your time on this product, just leave the page and don't look back."
3,"Primarily for video cameras, large for DSLR","I think this probably would be great for a videographer. It is very large, however, for a DSLR. The top plate only loads one way on the bottom clamp, which is why I stopped using it and went with another clamp system. Very sturdy and good value."
1,Not for instructional purposes,"This video did not offer the detail I was looking for in a Training tape. Given the price tag, I would have expected a lot more detail on how to develop and implement the use of FMEA's. Not much substance covered in the 14 minute video."
4,Nice Invitations,Very nice. Matched the picture exactly. You might want to say that there's 8 invitations in each package.
5,"Wonderful, funny mystery","I really like reading funny books, and this one has some funny stuff in it. I've been looking for an author besides Janet Evanovich that I found to be funny, and Dumas is it. There's a character in the book named Flank--well, I won't ruin it for you, but there are some funny scenes with him. But it's not just funny, there's a good mystery going on too. I hope I will read more soon from this author."
3,promising,"There are a lot of things to like about this book. The plot, for one, is much more carefully put together than in a lot of today's ""themed"" mysteries. I also think the book improved as it went along, so give it a fair chance! My major problem with the story is the initial set-up; I find it hard to believe that a relatively young adult rich woman (i.e. not a teenager and not a desperate old lady) would meet and marry a total stranger in five weeks, without ever checking his background. I also find it hard to connect with a character who is surprised when her husband says that of course he will have a job. (What did she think was going to happen?)The reason that this didn't spoil my enjoyment of the book is that the action that composes the rest of the story pushes such things into the background so that I could basically pretend that chapter wasn't there.On the whole, I will read other books by this author."
3,Hungry for Who Done It?,"Curl up on in your favorite chair or hop into bed for reading this charming mystery that takes place in San Francisco, California. Better yet - mix your favorite cocktail and prepare a plate of food because author, Margaret Dumas will take you for a long meal plus cocktails and wine as she leads you through the zany meetings of the group who form the ""who done it?"" gang. More characters pop up to keep you putting the puzzle pieces together. At times reminds me of the ""Thin Man"" characters - series with the humor, glib quips and colorful characters. I did get a bit impatient, wanting to get on with the murder investigations and out of the culinary delights, but being a San Franciscan I eased back onto my pillow and enjoyed the trip around the City and areas close by. A rainy day afternoon book, or a foggy one, to keep you amused and guessing. Easy read."
5,Fantastic DVD,"This has been among my favorite chamber music pieces for something like 40 years. I used to have a record of the music, and I thought that maybe the DVD would show the performers, but this one shows various scenes from the very area that inspired Schubert to write this lovely music. It is superbly done! I play it over and over again."
5,Home Improvement Season 5,"Once again my favorite series. I am a avid home improvement fan, and love every episode. I enjoy how so many episode deal witha real life situation and the way the seies depicts is utter genius. Too bad we don't have series like this now instead of all the useless reality shows. I miss friends, home improvement etc."
5,Home Improvement Laughter Continues,"During this 5th season the show along with its normal pranks and laughter has some very touching episodes, such as the one where they have a health scare with one of thier sons...It is dealt with seriousness and some laugher periods at the same time which makes the episode meaningful to the audience in many wasys. I would highly recommend this season again if you have fallen in love with it from the begining."
5,Wonderful Gripping Story,WOW! When I first started reading this book I was not sure I like the writing style. But it caught me after just a few pages and I could not put this book down until the very end. Cannot wait for his next book.
5,Exceptional Emotional Rollercoaster!!,"This novel is by far the best I have bought. I usually don't buy hardback books but I saw this and just picked it up....I know, I know, don't judge a book by its cover....but this time I was right! It is amazing how Mr. Jaskunas can write in a woman's voice, and it's even more amazing that I felt every emotion that Maggie was going through. This book really made me feel what she was feeling and that is a great read! I felt as if I were there and the sadness was mine. Thumbs up to Mr. Jaskunas and an amazing first novel!!!"
1,Awful,"""Hidden"" was pretty disappointing. The characters were all unlikeable, most especially the main character. It was a real chore getting through this work, mostly because the characters were so stereotypical and bland.By page 14, we figure out that Maggie, the main character, has no idea who attacked her, even though she positively identified her husband in court. And then, on for the rest of the novel, this is never again explored. I was expecting some self-inspection here, but instead the characters are flat and boring.I picked this book up hoping for something that would really get us into the mind of this woman, whose story could have been an interesting one. Instead, we get this uninspired story that fails to actually tell any kind of story. The only thing remotely interesting about this book is that the male author tells a woman's story from the first person (and that's been done before, by much more talented writers). Save your money and buy a book worth reading."
2,Hidden by Paul Jaskunas,"This book called Hidden by Paul Jaskunas is about a woman named Maggie Wilson; she believes so much it was her husband that assaulted her that one summer night. She confessed against him and sent him to jail. Six years later she's informed that an inmate has confessed to her assault. This confession cause Maggie to go through a great confusion by not knowing what or who to believe. Throughout the book, Maggie does everything she can to remember what really happened to her and why out of all people, her husband is the one she believed assaulted her."
2,Should have listened,As other reviewers said it is not easy to open and is poorly designed. I can't believe that they have not put a product on the market that does this function.
4,"Functional, but not durable","Does what it is supposed to do. Nothing else I've seen appears to be as functional. However, the design lacks durability and WILL BREAK after 4-6 months of use. The low price makes it easy to purchase another one. By the time my second one fails, my child will not need the lock on that cabinet any more."
3,Works Well,"They do work well, but last about 6 months. This time I ordered two, and when I put the last one on I'll order a couple more. At this price, I will take the 6 months they last.That being said, they are worth every penny! They keep my little man out of the cupboard he loves to get in the most. :-)"
2,Works for a little while.,"This lock works good for a little while, then the push mechanism breaks. It may or may not break completely off, so it could still work even when it breaks. I've gone through two of these already, and they only lasted a few months before they broke."
3,Works but has cheap screws,I found this product fairly easy to install but the screws that came with the product were so cheap that one of the heads broke off after I installed it. I had to later reinstall it with sturdier screws so it would be held close to the edge of the cabinet. I couldn't find any other options to child proof a lazy susan so I was limited to this product.
3,Grandpa,Door thickness is important and mine was too thick to work as designed.I am trying to remove some material to see if I can make it work.Otherwise it would work fine.
5,Works Great!,"I bought this for our kitchen cabinent. It works great! It's very easy to install, and keep my 15-month-old boy away from this cabinent. Good buy! Highly recommended!"
2,Functional but fragile,"The lazy susan cabinet lock installs easily and provides an external lock to keep your rotary cabinet from turning. Note that to be able to lock the cabinet the lazy susan door is held between a plastic ""backstop"" and a front lever. The backstop allows the lazy susan to open in only one direction, and (depending upon how it is installed), the backstop can block about two inches all the way around the circumference on the outside edge of the shelf. I had to remove anything along the outer edge of the top shelf for the door to be able to open. I installed this product on a lazy susan that is opened 5-10 times daily, and it lasted three months of careful usage before the lever snapped.Despite the drawbacks, rotary cabinets are a quick way to break a finger, and I was not able to find another product that fit the need. The safety first lock does the job, and I am buying another replacement until my 1 year old loses his obsession with the cabinet."
4,Works great for us!,"This lock works great for our lazy susan. It was easy for my husband to install, and we don't find it hard to turn the latch. Well, I should say that it doesn't cause me any strife; it is tough enough to keep the toddlers out! The only thing that is a pain is only being able to turn the cabinet one way. In my opinion it doesn't bother me NEARLY as much as having my kids tearing apart the cabinet all day long. Pleased with it overall!"
4,Great Product,"I was happy when I came across this because we had to stop using the LS because my son turned it into his toy. I cant say if it was easy or not to install because my husband did it and i wasn't home when he did. But its on and it works and I have my LS back! The only downfall to this is once its on, you can only turn the LS one direction. Oh and getting use to unlocking it does take a little bit but once you've done it a couple times it's pretty easy. In the end I am happy with the product."
2,It didn't last long under regular use,"This was one of the only lazy suzan cabinet locks I could find. Installation was relatively easy, but the way the product installs it only allows the lazy suzan to open in one direction. Not a huge issue, but something to note.The lever is difficult to disengage with one hand and it broke after 121 days of use (30 day warranty).In any event, I could never find an alternate product anywhere else - so I guess there's not much option."
2,"Works, but difficult to use.","Installation was pretty easy, be sure to place it well above the shelf otherwise it will bump into everything near the edge.Any holes in the cabinet are hidden when closed. A plus with a rental home.Unlocking it can be a problem as many other reviewers have mentioned. My son can't unlock it, which is great, but my wife can't either. I always know what the problem is when I hear cursing coming from the kitchen including the phrase ""I hate this #&*@ing thing.""The other downside is the tab on the inside that won't allow but one direction of travel. My kitchen has two lazy-susan cabinets and one is blocked from full rotation buy part of the structure. I had to choose between using only half the storage space and leaving it accessible to my toddler.If I can find some other style of lock for this I will but that instead. I would suggest that to everyone else as well."
3,"Agree with ""works for a while""","We have just broken another one of these. The push tab broke off, and it is useless - my son is almost two and knows to move it easily, and loves to play with the lazy susan, and I expect pinched fingers as soon as he's alone in the kitchen. We aren't pleased with the quality, and it's not always the easiest to use, but it is effective, and the only one on the market. I hate to do it, but I'm looking to buy another one, but I've had a hard time finding one. Something is better than nothing, even for a short time."
1,Did not work,Did not fit for corner kitchen cabinets at all. Disappointing that it did not work for what it was designed for.
2,Works well before it BREAKS!,"Our 2 year old and 1 year old love to play with the lazy susan. This lock was great until it broke. The push tab broke off and now the lock is useless. This is the 3rd time we have purchased this lock, unfortunately there isn't much else out there on the market to protect our babies fingers from being pinched in the lazy susan. We will not be purchasing another one, I guess we will have to come up with another device..stay tuned, we may be millionaires some day!"
1,Bad Design & Cheeply Made,"Pretty easy to install - took less than 15 minutes. The build quality is very poor. The whole assembly is made from very cheap and flimsy plastic, and considering that you'll be constantly putting pressure and twisting the mechanism to unlock, there is no doubt in my mind that it won't last long. Personally, I found the lock very hard to open. I often times found myself having to use two hands and fiddle with it just to unlock it. After about 5 tries I was frustrated and used enough force to pull the screws out of the cabinet. I just installed the Safety 1st Tot-Lok and it works great - I know they are a bit more expensive but I'd recommend it over this product any day."
4,Fast reader,"This reader is among the faster ones that I've tried. I was able to get about 6 MB/sec when reading from a 1GB Sandisk Ultra II CompactFlash card. The fact that the cord tucks into the side of the reader is a nice touch that makes it easy to travel with. I don't have to carry lots of cables with me.Beware that the Amazon picture is slightly misleading as the device has been updated and no longer matches the picture. The new version is slightly bigger: It's actual dimensions are 4.4"" x 3"" x 0.6""."
5,Handy item,"I use this all the time to ""read"" or transfer information. It is compact and easy to use."
3,Problems Reading 4 GB SD Cards,"TRENDnet USB 6-in-1 Memory Card Reader/WriterMy TRENDnet USB 6-in-1 Memory Card Reader/Writer works well overall. It works well with my Macs. I've had it for 2-3 years now, and I just ran into my first problem with it. It doesn't work with my new 4 Gigabyte SD Ultra II card. It isn't a bad card because it works in both my camera and my Palm Treo PDA/Cell Phone. According to the fact sheet published by TRENDnet, it should support SD Cards that are ""16MB and up."" I have other SD Ultra cards in 1 and 2 GB sizes, and it works just fine with those. So in my opinion, users who want a memory card reader that works with large SD cards may want to look for another product."
2,kentucky colonels,Sound quality was very bad one instrument is very loud another you can barely here and this is on every song on the album.
1,Charger not compatible with Iphone G3,"WARNING: THE CAR CHARGER IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE IPHONE G3. The audio still works, but the iphone does not charge."
2,Doesn't work with new ipods,This model will not charge your newer ipods or iphone.Get the newer model.
3,Great charger. Poor sound output.,I bought this to replace a product with similar functionality by belkin. at first it worked great but now there are issues with the line level audio output which is disappointing since that was the reason I chose this specific unit. If you are looking for just a charger for your ipod then look no further.
5,Works great,"No problems, works great. The cord is a coil type, so you can wrap it around the audio cable to make it more manageable. Pauses the iPod when it loses power, causing it to eventually shut down, great feature."
2,A few problems...,"This looked like the perfect solution for using my iPod Video in my car for extended periods, however, this was not to be the case. The first problem I had was that (as a few other people have mentioned) the plug was too large to fit firmly into the iPod when it was in the case that I have for it. I could manage to get it in but only with some jiggling. The second problem I had was that the sound quality from this thing is awful. There is a substantial amount of buzzing and hissing caused by interference from the vehicle. I ended up returning this item for a refund and purchasing the DLO Autopod car charger which works just fine. The DLO is just a charger and doesn't have the audio-out plug."
4,"If you have a buzz or a hiss when you use this, read my review","Certain cars (like my 2006 Toyota Prius) give a buzz or hiss sound when using the charger and line out at the same time. This problem goes away if you unplug the charger part and use the line out only. There is nothing wrong with this product, but you need a noise filter like the PAC SNI-1/3.5 Noise Filter. This will fix the problem and allow you to have distortion free sound while charging your ipod.A lot of cars don't have this problem, but if yours does, it's not the Monster cable's fault.Despite this, a fine product. The only trouble I occasionally have is the buttons that release the dock connector feel a little cheap and the connector doesn't easily come off. Otherwise, I'm glad I got this, primarily for the great sound quality over line out."
1,SF planet = scam,"doesnt work with the new ipod nano, gives an incompatible message and wont charge. dont buy from SF planet, beware of false advertising and leaving out information from the product description. weak move the way I see it, they are prolly a bunch of low lifes from some wack third world country."
1,Beware! This does not work with iPod Touches.,"Those who are saying that this item works with the iPod touch must be shills for the seller. It most certainly does NOT work with the iPod touch. I just received one, and when I plugged it into my car and then my iPod, an error pops up on the iPod saying ""Cannot charge, device incompatible with this iPod.""Argh. Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back and eating the horribly high shipping costs."
4,monster cable ipod car charger/connector,"The Monster Cable ipod car charger is one of the few that, in addition to the charger cable, also allow to insert an additional cable between the charger itself and the car auxiliary port. Thus by connecting the ipod to the charger you are also connected to your car radio (If the cable to the aux. inlet is already inserted, that is). Surprisingly to me, the cable to connect to the aux. port is not included in the box though!"
4,Works as advertised,"I finally got around to buying an iPod car charger. And guess what? It charges my iPod. :) Seriously, I found this to work great. No electrical noise leaked into the audio signal, and it's wonderful to be able to use the line-level output. That's the main reason I chose this one.The other reason I chose this one is because supposedly it automatically turns on and off with the ignition. In my car, that doesn't happen ( a ~20 year old BMW), but I suspect this is a function of the car, not the charger. That is, whether the 12v outlet is switched or unswitched. It's a little inconvenient for me to have to unplug it each time I turn off the car (to avoid drawing down the battery), but the problem rests more with the car than this product.So, I happily recommend this product. And hey -- it's the rare Monster product that's reasonably priced!"
4,"Living a Dog's Life, Jazzy, Juicy, and Me","I'm a Doggy-mom and have recently added a Yorkie to my Fur-baby Pack. I've been excited to read all the books I can that have a Yorkie as the subject matter or one of the main characters. Cindy Adams books are a fun read for many reasons. They're a light, easy read and are chocked full of tidbits of New York Society that I can only experience vicariously. She's lead an exciting life and she's a good writer. You only have to read a few pages to realize how very much she loves her dogs. The section dedicated to the traumatic death of Jazzy was one of the most touching passages I've read. Her narrative of the events was so descriptive that I felt the pain of loss along with her. Though her books may not appeal to everyone, in my opinion they are a must-read for anyone who has surrendered their hearts to a Yorkie."
1,fur on dogs?,"Please help me understand why people are reading a book about dogs when the woman who wrote the book and owns the dogs dresses them in fur. Am I the only one to see the hypocracy? She doesn't love animals, only her's. Please don't buy this book."
1,Will someone please kill this woman and all her dogs!,"Besides being guilty of beastiality, Cindy Adams is guilty of animal abuse. Dogs do not want to be dressed up in little outfits and hats. Dogs do not want to be fork fed chicken from Le Cirque. Cindy Adams needs to learn that dogs do not think they are people. Dogs know that they are dogs. Cindy's dogs think that she's a dog too.Having said that. Dogs that wear clothes do not deserve to live. And neither do their owners."
2,"Yes, born that way.","There's no doubt that the author has had many strugles in her life and I applaud her courage. However, books like this give the impression that homosexuality is somehow a disseas that can be cured. If one is to read this book closely they will soon discover that nowhere in the book does the auther state that her homosexual feelings have been changed into heterosexual ones. She mearly states how she has been able to supress her feelings and leave the gay lifestyle. In fact, their is not a single case on record were a homosexual person has been completely cured. Books like these do more harm then good."
1,A rock and a hard place,"If it were not so tragic, it might almost be amusing to notice the parallel between books that tell you how to overcome SSA with the aid of Mormonism, and books that tell you how to overcome Mormonism with the aid of Baptist anti-cult ""healers."" I wonder if there are any gay/lesbian Mormons out there who learned how to escape from SSA, and then learned how to escape from Mormonism? If you can leave one thing, you can leave the other thing! If you unleash the dog, there's no telling where it might wander."
1,Whats wrong with u people ??,"OK, i know this doll is not great looking like my scenes but they do have a meaning and a care i have two flavas that my cat takes away from me but remimber save them and couple more years like in 2009 or 2008 u problely get big $$$$$$$$ ya know wat i mean ???"
1,Get this piece of euro trash out of my sight,"Firstly i would like to know how this product can have any ""educational"" what is there to learn, to dress like a ho-bo person? what is the point of this barbie? I hate it i hate it i hate it!!!!!!! why is this filth even being sold. Have you seen the ads in australia? They are so annoying with the dolls trying to look hip, like hello these are so stupid. The product is only promoting the filth on the streets with children acting older than they actually are, becoming like britney spears posing half nude. My tip dont but his product and you will be sure that your child wont be disturbed by this euro trash."
1,I just threw up on my new Wintertime Wonderland Bratz doll.,"THESE DOLLS ARE BAD INFLUENCES ON YOUNG CHILDREN. TAKE THEM AWAY NOW! THEY ARE SAYING IT'S COOL TO SHOW OFF YOUR BODY, BUT IT'S NOT! I'd recommend a Bratz doll, because not only are they prettier, but they're also more modest, and influence children to just have fun! I would know; I'm their numba' one fan! Who would wanna dress up as some street bum hooker? Not me! Mattel, throw this useless hunk o' trash away NOW! Unless you want all girls influenced by this molested 'cause of their tiny skirts and exposed belly buttons! HUNK OF TRASH! I'd rather buy a MyScene doll, and that's saying alot; My Scenes are ugly!"
1,Bratz are just as bad,"Yes i know that these ""flavas"" are a total flop for mattel, but bratz are just as `ugly and pathetic. I vomited in my louis vuitton bag when i got mine and i puked on my precious barbie collectible (society girl). Does anyone have a remedy to remove fermented rice and seaweed from doll hair?"
5,Good decision!,"This ruby Tupperware container is one of my two favorite food storage items. It is pretty to set out simply with bars in it, or to use for burritos, or leftover lasagna, etc. When I need to repackage food of this quantity, my ruby Tupperware is always the container I choose."
1,Filled with factually incorrect statements,"Wow. What a disappointment. ""Mistakes"" were made in descriptions of several breeds, not just the Bengal. I found little to no objectivity in this book's breed descriptions. One questions where the author got her information. Poorly researched, no wonder the breeders and other cat lovers are upset about this. The only nice thing about it was it had lots of great pictures. If you must buy this book, definitely wait for the revised edition. Hopefully that one will be based on fact rather than politically-charged legends. There are dozens of better choices right now."
2,Lacks accurate information on all breeds,"I found the section on the Bengal cat to be totally inaccurate. The author obviously didn't do her homework here! These are not ""wild"" cats. They are loving and extremely intelligent! I have to wonder if there is misinformation on other breeds as well. The pictures are beautiful, but this does not make a book of this sort a good book. This book was meant to ""inform"" not ""misinform"". The author was irresponsible to not check out all the information before publisihing it."
1,beware of manufacturer!!!!!,"This toy was on the top of my son's Christmas list. Upon arrival, we found the case to be cracked (not the fault of the carrier), a part missing, and basically cheap workmanship. The phone number listed for NSI was disconnected, the website gone, and the address bogus. Basically, you get what you get and the company won't honor the warranty...because you can't reach them!"
1,smashed,"this product arrived broken and all the pieces are smashed. The saddest part is it was a birthday gift for a child who really wanted to play. Now, learning I purchased this from toys r us via amazon have found i cannot return it to amazon it has to go thru the manufacturer. To rate this product is very hard because it is in pieces."
2,Not for use in weather,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas and her grandparents came through. We put it outside and the next day it was in pieces on the other side of the yard. Granted, we are not having the mildest winter but it is a weather kit, for Pete's sake."
5,Excellent album!,Very peaceful and masterful music. I have listened to this album scores of times and still love it! I easily and gladly recommend this album! Enjoy!
5,Special music,This music is very special. A unique gift to the west. Vibrations are very real and powerful. Blessings.
5,Divine Resonance,"This is my favorite cd.I listen to it in morning before work, after work, before bed and never get tired of it! If only it were longer. It is deeply moving, I would even say life changing. I find myself more relaxed and peacefull. I'm looking forward to Invoke The Masters."
5,A cd to take me to another world...,"This is a amazing cd that I like to listen to and fits me in whatever mood I am in. I could be angry after a basketball game or even happy because I did well on a test. Being a student, this cd is very helpful to me during stressful times. It is very soothing and almost puts me in a different world. I highly recommend this cd to anyone interested!"
2,Add a couple bucks to the cost for....,".... duct tape! ;-}>.... allows you to position the light anywhere....Uh Huh.....The base will support the lamp if the gooseneck is straight up, or straight over the switch, but since the gooseneck and lamp weigh more than the base, even that is unsteady, and any other position will need something to tape it down to your desk to stay up. Maybe if they had saved some of the lead from their paint and put it in the base it would have helped. There is a battery compartment, so you can put in your own, or some old dead batteries to stabalize it.Other than that it does (so far) what it advertises as far as light. Don't know about the mosquito repellent feature the packaging boasts about though! LOL!Almost worth buying to read the packingWarning! Spoiler:* Super Bright* Gentle* Benefit from Preventing Eyesight.ROFL!!!!"
4,Very informative...a worthwhile read,"If you're interested in gaining knowledge of secret societies and their power and political influence throughout the ages then this book is for you. Michael Howard appears to possess a vast knowledge of these occult groups, from early paganism and Rosicrucians to todays Masons. His writings on the Vatican and also of the Third Reich will astonish. Everyone of power is involved in one way or another! Men of distinction beware of Lilith and Isis! Read on!"
3,Great Research Material--for Beginner/refers to good books,"This is a great book to add to your collection, if you are interested in, or research, Secret Societies. It has been a long time, since I read this one, but this book gave me good reference material to research & many other books of this genre refer to Howard's book. Add it to your collection, so it will be on-hand when you see quotes in other works.The information provided by another reader is true--the information about George Washington is completely in Error in ""The Occult Conspiracy."" I have posted the same information in clubs, but I forgot to return to this review and Update my findings.""A New Encyclopaedia of Freemasonry,"" by A.E. Waite & other sources discount much of the material in ""The Occult Conspiracy.""However, this books is useful as a reference book/bibliography."
4,My Review,"I thought the book, ""Occult Conspiracy"" was fascinating and very educational. It got a little slow at times but so does any book, however I loved learning about the different secret societies throughout history and I especially felt that Michael Howard had a vast amount of knowledge."
3,"Not error-free, but these errors do not effect conclusions","A previous commentator suggested that the book was riddled with errors and somehow suggests the book's conclusions are inaccurate because of that.Yes, Howard screws up on the year of death (1799) of George Washington, but is, in fact, correct on his birth (1732). And if no one noticed, Howard claims that the King David started the building of the first temple. This is also incorrect. It was King Solomon that built the first temple because King David had been forbidden by God to build it because of his sin of adultery.However, though there are errors like these, it does not change the fact that there was a temple built in Jersualem about the time of King David & Solomon or that George Washington was a mason.Though one cannot use the book as scholarly work (a reference) because of the errors, the conclusions are still pretty interesting and revealing."
2,Too much knob-twisting in the booth,"This emotionally bland requiem (compare to the old Phila/Ormandy recording with Cesare Valletti to see what I mean) is ruined for me by the Sanctus -- beautifully sung by John Aler, but wrecked by the addition of a truly offensive amount of echo. Let there be a special fate for engineers who ruin recordings. I propose a special room full of knobs, meters, and slide controls, with soft background music playing. The room is locked. Everytime any control is moved in any way, the music gets louder. But I digress."
4,Excellent Rendition of Berlioz's Masterpiece,"If you want to hear a real gloomy sad piece of music, this is the CD for you. Berlioz's Requiem is one of the most somber pieces of music you will ever hear. The other tracks are throwaways, but the Requiem shows both Shaw and Berlioz at their best."
2,Great Chorus but prosaic performance. Pass on this one,"Having sung this piece, i fully appreciate Robert Shaw's accomplishments with his magnificent chorus. He is not a particularly great conductor however, and this piece needs one. Nor is telarc's sound anything to crow about. The acoustic is too dead to do these tremendous forces justice. Remember it was composed for performance in the massive Les Invalides, not a dry concert hall. With all the fine recordings of this piece i would discourage you from wasting money on this one. If you want a modern recording in the SACD format, and are a fan of the Atlanta Sym. and Chorus, then buy Robert Spano's Telarc recording. His soloist, Frank Lopardo is as good as John Aler, the chorus is still in great hands under chorus master Mackenzie, and Spano is a much more talented conductor. I also love the Munch recording, now sounding beautiful on SACD with tenor Leopold Simoneau. No one since has ever sung the Sanctus solo as beautifully."
4,A good collection by a historic artist,"This book is a collection of pencil drawings by Thomas Moran, the man who first brought images of John Wesley Powell's famous 1869 trip down the Colorado River to the American public.Each group of photos is accompanied by an article written by a contemporary of Moran's, and all are historically valuable, and often interesting.The book contains sections on the Mountain West, Yellowstone, the Rocky Mountains, the Colorado River, the Sierras, and Yosemite.The drawing of the now-lost Glen Canyon is my very favorite image of that place, and is completely unlike any other extant drawing or photograph: it's dark and gloomy, frightening even, nothing like the colorful place depicted in so many other accounts. For that drawing alone, and for the drawings of the Grand Canyon, this book is well worth the price.It's weird though, this book is a paperback, and yet it comes with a dust jacket...."
2,Reality Fiction,"We are becomming all to familiar with ""ripped from the headlines"" quazi fiction. Presented in a non-standard newsprint/dialogue format, Inder Dan Ratnu's novella, FIRST LADY PRESIDENT, follows the Clinton scandal and presumed repercussions with would be bitterly opposed by most ""good old boys"". It is a quick read, spotlighting how foreign authors view American politics."
3,It's ok,This album is way too short. Only 10 tracks are on this cd. So I don't know maybe I am just cynical. I hope that their next album is harder and longer.
2,nice production team...,"congratulations are due to tony mcanany for creating one of the worst rock productions in a long time. i give this album a 2 simply because most of the songs themselves are decent, they just sound like total crap. 38th's live act is full of energy from the very beginning of every set, and the beginning of ""hear my cry"" is the wussiest excuse for rock production i've heard in a long time. album high point: songwriting. album low, low, low, low point: drums (come on!) 38th's new demo has some cool stuff on it though. oh, and it was recorded in one evening for a few hundred bucks and it sounds a million freaking times better than ""turn the tides,"" which cost, i don't know, a few hundred thousand bucks. i think it's getting released on their website sometime soon."
4,they're back!,"i have the turn the tides cd and it's pretty good the songs are uplifting and straight forward it's production quality could be a lot better but hopefully the album that they're working on now will have better production, they just started touring again last fall and I'm not exactly sure when the CD release date is since they havn't put up the info but i'm guessing it'll be some time summer or fall 06 if you wan't to listen to a couple of songs they have a demo or two up at myspace.com/38thparallel"
4,Regina: Surely the modern Queen of Jazz Violin!,"Regina is one of my favorite modern artists- in this album with Kenny, you hear how well they play off of one another. A lot of her rhythms are hypnotic and make you want to dance, or else try to steal her talent! My favorites on this album would have to be Softly, As In A Morning Sunrise, Phantoms, and Flower. Of course, all the songs are good, except that Misterioso got on my nerves. Otherwise, it's a jewel of a CD."
2,Rather Earthbound,"Pianist Kenny Barron is, as always, a delight, but what keeps this recording from being truly delightful is the rather earthbound violin playing of Regina Carter. Her previous release, Motor City Moments, was quite a bore, but I thought that might have been because of the fusion genre. Having heard her playing on this CD, however, I am less impressed than ever. There just seems to be no playfulness in her playing. Stephane Grapelli in his later years sounded much younger at heart than does the young Ms. Carter. Her tone also sounds heavy and thick.The sound quality is excellent. Others have praised this release; perhaps you will like it better than I do."
1,"Great Lab, Lousy Support","As with most software, support is more important than the product. Todd Lammle put together a good product (as usual), but Sybex's poor support is enough reason to avoid this Trainer. The on-line license installation didn't work. The Sybex web site was no help at all. My e-mail was answered by a uselessly lengthy and cryptic response. Phone calls for the off-line license installation do not use a toll-free number. My wait time was over 70 minutes, and then I was cut off. There is no phone support in the evening, when most people would be home to make their installation. I'd suggest looking around for another product before buying any software from a company with such disregard for the customer's time and money."
3,Poor man's Cisco router,"If you don't have an access to a Cisco router, this tool is the way to go. Although it only offers a limited number of commands. Also, there are books that cover the Cisco IOS extensively: ""Cisco IOS for IP Routing"" by Andrew Colton and ""Cisco IOS in a Nutshell"" by James Boney. These two should take a long way to a very good understanding of Cisco routing."
2,Unlock code is flawed,"I bought the CCNA version and it worked pretty well for me. I've waited over a month for the CCNP version to be released only to find that the unlock code was flawed from the start. I respect Sybex's protection of their product, but feel faulted after paying good money for a product that won't even let the customer use it. Why do we put up with this kind of nonsense. Sybex's support also offers a manual unlock by calling them direct, however their customer service is only open from 9:00 to 5:00 PST. I came home from work yesterday only to find that I must wait until morning to call their support personnel. My suggestion for all...don't waste your money ordering via overnight delivery, because you'll have to wait until they open anyway. I'd love to rate the product higher, but have no idea of its quality given the fact that it's currently ""locked."""
3,I loved this item,"I am a CCNP with the help of this virtual lab. I also have the virtual etrainer, which I barely used. Anyway, the lab is exactly what it says. Simulator, it will not work exactly like the real thing, but if you are new to this field this is what you need. The ""Support section kind of sucks but the other three are so good it makes up for it.I also have the CCNA, and I'm working on my CCSP.Todd, get to working on the CCSP Virtual lab!!!!"
2,If you have no experience at all,"with Cisco products then by all means purchase the software to assist you with your preparation for the exams. So far, I have only taken (and passed) the switching exam, and I am quite disappointed with the lab. There was a lot missing - ATM,FDDI,Troubleshooting MLS, and the worst was the lack of commands for the router when configuring Inter-VLAN routing. But, like I said before, if you have no ""real"" experience with switches and the like, this is the product to get you there."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed. All the bad coments below are true, although I think Todd Lammle tried to do a good work. You only have 33 very basic ""chopped"" commands in routing, no ""show ip protocol"", no ""show ip ospf"", etc. Someone knows if this is the most ""advanced simulator"" in the market?If this is it, better to buy second-hand equipments.I don't know how difficult it is to simulate a real environment . It is necessary to pay more, OK no problem, but overcoming the limitations (minimun 100 full-enabled IOS commands by device in any lab!!)"
3,This book explains the basics of internatinonalization,This well structured book is a bit shallow at times. The basics of the process of internationalization are clearly defined. But the authors should have considered more aspects of the process.
4,"The best CD I've gotten in a long, long time!","When I heard the clips of Sue's songs played on my local radio station I knew I had to get this CD for my daughter - a full-time stay-at-home Mom. My daughter LOVES it!! She listens to it regularly (in the car, cooking dinner, etc) and told me that it was the best CD she's gotten in a long, long time. Her favorites are ""The Kids Are Finally Asleep"" and ""Mommy. Mommy, Mommy"". (Mine is ""Wal-Mart Woman"".) She said ""Thank goodness someone out there knows what it's like!""If you are a Mom, or if you KNOW a Mom, you need to buy this CD. Trust me - any Work-A-Home Mom needs the humor, understanding and fun this CD brings!"
4,sadly and sweetly written,"Joyce Johnson's ""Missing Men"" is a wrenchingly sad account of her life, coming of age in 1950s Bohemia. An only child, she details her mother's unhappy journey as an orphan who made a late and unfulfilling marriage and who became a ""stage mother,"" lavishing her daughter with love.Joyce Johnson broke away from the homelife that stifled her, and gave her heart, several times, to abstract artists: This book is about blankness and absence. Although she writes without excessive self-pity, nevertheless bleakness, sorrow, and longing permeate its pages. There is little here about her successful career, her life in publishing, which might mitigate the wistful tone of her memoir."
1,The Standard Deviants World Geography,"This DVD is so mind-numbingly stupid that it makes me angry every time I remember that I actually paid money for it. It gets one star only because Zero was not an option. I bought it for my then 11 year old son. It seems public schools no longer teach geography, and I believe it's a national disgrace that Americans are so ignorant about most of the planet. This DVD does nothing to overcome that ignorance. Yes it has lots of quick, MTV style, scene changes and effects. Yes it has upbeat(if moronic) teenage hosts. But its content is so general as to actually teach nothing. And its content is also factually incorrect - it seems unconscionable to me that the editors missed the fact that Mexico is part of North America. The DVD tells us that North America consists of the U.S. and Canada. I'll grant you that as a forty-something I'm biased against the style over substance tv format, but even my son found its lack of content a borderline fraud."
3,Ok,This video is ok. At times it is rather confusing. The writers were more worried about being funny instead of presenting the material. And their research into these topics seems very limited.
3,Poor Mexico!,I can't believe so- called geographers really place Mexico outside the Northern Hemisphere! Where did they go to school? This should be called Substandard Deviants! It really needs to be corrected or taken off the market. I want my money back!
4,Good bargain range hood,"Product as advertised. The large home improvement stores in my area seam to carry the ultra-cheap ductless hoods and then skip strait to the uber-expensive ducted models, bypassing this intermediate option for those of us who want a budget ducted fan. Fit perfectly as a replacement for a 20+ year old 30"" GE range hood. No frills. The low-speed fan setting is not very useful but high-speed does the trick. Easy installation and would get a 5-star rating if the low-speed fan setting was better."
4,need for speed,"this product ok for the price,but it be better with a mediun speed.The shipping was on time and merchandice in exelent shape.There is nothing better than amazon.com ,I recomended."
1,Amazon is a drag,"Amazon used a service where Fedex delivers to my local post office, not to my shipping address. Then I have to go there and pick it up - during the holidays - when lines are long - and time is short. Ugh. Had I known, I would've ordered from somewhere else. Hope the backpack is good because Amazon is lousy with returns. Never again."
5,Contemporary understanding of Jesus's healing works,"Steven Galipeau's thoughtful, insightful exploration of the healing ministry of Jesus of Nazareth, in the light of contemporary Jungian understandings, is one of the very best books on the subject of spiritual healing that I have ever read. For liberal-minded Christians frustrated by the tangles of church-centered Christology and theology, it's refreshing to find an author who emphasizes Jesus's main interest -- helping hurting people get well. Highly recommended. I hope to hear of more works from this author's pen."
4,Exceptional but a little outdated...,"The book contains many examples, more then other SQL books that I have read. The book covers a lot of nested queries, sub-quries and co-related queries using EXISTS, ALL operators. It is a little out-dated but still serve my purpose which is to become proficient in SQL. I would buy a second edition if one exists for Oracle 7 or 8."
4,When will this book be updated for Oracle 7 and 8?,"I have found this book the only useful book on using SQLPlus. In fact, it was the ONLY book on SQLPlus that I have found anywhere. It has exactly what I need. However, the book only covers Oracle 6.x, which is a bit outdated. Are there any plans for new editions of the title?"
3,Covers the basics but poor index makes it frustrating to use,"This book does in fact cover the basics of SQL. However,the guide to Oracle part of the title is inaccurate. Only asmall fraction of this book has anything particular todo with Oracle. For example, the entire section on PL/SQLis under thirty pages and the data dictionary rates onlya couple of paragraphs.The index is woeful. Many subjects are covered in the bookand not mentioned in the index which makes this a difficultvolume to use as a reference.The best audience for this book would be students taking ahigh-school or undergraduate course in beginning SQL."
2,"May be good for you, but doesn't taste good.","This may very well be good for you, but it taste like I imagine gruel would. I wanted to like it since I had 6 boxes of it, but I can't make myself like it."
5,all time favourite hot breakfast choice,"As a person who tries to make good food choices AND likes things with great taste and texture, THIS product is such a winner! It is smooth, nutty, and amazingly versatile. I add nuts, fruit, and sometimes extra flax seeds and I am full for many hours. LOVE the soy protein in it, too! I may never eat oatmeal again! Very hard to find in stores here so I am happy Amazon carried it! Lisa in NY"
5,Amazing Cereal,"Wonderful taste and texture. I loved steel oats but this stuff is delicious, filling and satisfying. Having it come in bulk of 6 boxes keeps a steady supply on hand and no need to run out. I sometimes add blackberrier, or maplle syrup or a spoonfull of peanut butter or almonds fora great way to nutritionally start the day"
5,Christopher's Best,I'm directing BEYOND THERAPY this summer and as delightful as the movie isnothing can take the place of the creative imagination.The movie is great. What an 80's kicker!!!!
3,"Good actors, great director, average movie.","All the ingredients were there to make this movie great, but somehow when they all mixed together the taste was bland."
1,Robert Altman destroys a Christopher Durang Masterpiece,"Beyond Therapy by Christopher Durang is an excellent intellegent comedy. Unfortunately Beyond Therapy by Robert Altman is not. He tries to place realism in an existential play, for example destroying one of the important themes of Durang's play by placing real waiters in the restaurant. There are too many distractions, with strange background noises and many characters who are never developed. It drops in and out of the play script, and the audience can immediately tell those moments as the style of the lines change."
3,Return of the Vampire,"I have loved this movie for years. With the exception of Dracula, this is one of Bella's best. It has a vampire, a werewolf, and a war. A British lady scientist really gives it to Bella."
3,Surprisingly well made with Lugosi in fine form.,"This came out the same year as Siodmak's Son of Dracula and is equally as good. Lugosi does well as Armand Tesla, vampire, who is unloosed during the London blitz and seeks revenge on those who previously ""did him in"" by attacking their grown up son and daughter. Lugosi projects malevolence in a good performance. Solid work, too from old pros Frieda Inescort and Miles Mander."
4,Lugosi's Best Vampire Film,"""Return of the Vampire"" (1943) is an underrated, atmospheric chiller that surpasses the missed opportunities of ""Dracula"" and ""Mark of the Vampire."" Unlike Tod Browning, director Lew Landers gives Bela Lugosi a terrific showcase as vampire Armand Tesla. The World War II setting works quite well and the script is surprisingly intelligent. There are moments in ""Return of the Vampire"" that evoke a Val Lewton quality in terms of mood and character development. Lugosi, in particular, effectively underplays his role - complemented by a fine cast. Columbia Pictures made relatively few horror films during the 1930s and '40s, yet ""Return of the Vampire"" remains the studio's finest contribution to the genre."
4,Atmospheric and creepy!!!,"This film is very interesting.....atmospheric....creepy....a talking werewolf (which comes off as kinda disturbing,in a good way)....good film pacing,solid acting and of course the great Bela.A little gem."
2,Return this vampire,"THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE is an interesting WWII-era 'B' grade Bela Lugosi movie made by not UNIVERSAL but COLUMBIA studios. There's plenty of gothic atmosphere, fog and a caped Lugosi oozing his lines at Nina Foch to enchant and delight fans.His assistant, a talking werewolf who stays hirsute even in the day and when the moon isn't full, is to some this picture's weakest element. Suggest you ignore the beast and concentrate on Bela's beautiful performance instead.Note that GOODTIMES videotapes are recorded in LP mode, have a somewhat degraded video quality and lack HiFi sound (thus the two-star rating). VHS collectors should seek out SONY/COLUMBIA's 1996 edition ofTHE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE.It's also available onDVD."
5,Great toys for girls or boys,"My granddaughter, almost age 5, loves Playmobil toys, and her mom, my older daughter, loves their product line because most (perhaps 90% by serendipitous observation) are made in Europe, and not in China. Playmobil's attention to detail in their products is magnificent, and kids get a chance to use their imagination in all kinds of creative ways, as the products are totally adaptable to variation. This kitchen set was the last room left to fill in her Playmobil Grande Mansion, which was originally the property of my middle daughter, now 22. Now, if only I can get her to ask for the Playmobil airport set, or construction set, so I can get a chance to revert to my inner child. I should note that as many of the pieces of Playmobil sets are very small, these should not be given to children under three, or to any child with a tendency to put things in their mouth."
4,Very Heavy Set,I am happy with these items but I am only give it 4 Stars because I wish the set came with more then 4 mini trifle bowls.I don't know about you but... I always have way more then 4 guests.I guess it's OK for a family of 4 though.I recommend this product for quality.
1,main item was broken,"This was ordered as a present from my mother to myself. When unwrapped I discovered that the main bowl was broken. My mother had lost the invoice, so we could not return the item. So I now have a broken trifle bowl."
1,Sucks,Too rough needs to be softer I wouldn't waste any money on this buy a softer leather instead. It will eat up the finish
1,Waste Of Money,"As Shannon said,>> I believe I could operate my 20D without the manual and just>> this book.As the manual is free and the book $35, why not""I believe I could operate my 20D with the manual and without this book (and save $35)""."
3,Ordinary,I expected a little more specificity on the Canon. Lots of the book was boilerplate that applied to photography generally. Many people would like that I suppose. It could easily be recycled with other camera details substituted; probably was. I think the product is a little pricey considering that it's a spiral bound pamphlet.
3,Moderately useful but overpriced,"I bought this shortly after getting a new 20D. I was looking for a supplement to the camera's manual that would do two things: (1) provide additional detail about settings, capabilities, etc.; and (2) give me some idea about when/why to use various settings to achieve desired effects. As a complete novice to photography, my ideal book would have been mixture of basic photography techniques with camera-specific information about how to accomplish them. The book accomplishes #1 well but is incomplete when it comes to #2. As a matter of fact, I still have to use the manual for certain features that are not sufficiently well explained here.For what you get, this is way overpriced. I would have happily paid $15, but it is not worth more. The manual is a cheap spiral bound booklet that feels like it was produced using inexpensive copy paper and a black-and-white laser. The CD contains nothing but a .pdf version of the manual."
1,Short Course - Very Dissapointed,Very poor production (Black & White) for such an expensive photography book. Looks like they went to Kinkos and had them spiral bound it and sent it out. I sent mine back. Would not recommend.
2,Fooled by CD - Very overpriced,"While the information is good - it further enlarges on the really excellent Canon EOS20D manual, it should not show a CD. The only reaon there is a CD is that this was self-pubished with black and white copes of a color acrobat file and this is what you are getting on CD - another copy of the book that you get in Black and white - only in color on the CD. There is a print copy and a screen copy. This book would be fine if its cost were about $10 or $12, but a complete rip-off for almost $30."
1,EOS 20D Photography (Book & CD),"If you already have the 20D user guide from Canon, and if you have any experience with photography or if you have read any other basic photography book, then this book is a total waste of your time and money."
2,Spend this money elsewhere,"There are other sources (such as the Magic Lantern guide to the 20D) that in my opinion are more helpful. Especially at this price!The book is spiral bound in black-and-white; not well edited (""let's"" is used too often to mean ""allows""). The CD is nothing but a PDF version of the book, attached with double-sided cello tape to the inside back cover. At least the CD is in color and may appeal to those who enjoy reading books from their computer monitors. Neither the book (due to its size) nor the CD are practical to take with you to the field with the camera"
3,Nice but not perfect,"Works great for small dust, but you'd better use it in a very clean environment otherwise you'll add more dust than you'll remove.Construction is not super strong - looks very cheap & not very solid for the price you pay - but it works..."
4,"Very nice paddle, but one big (fixable) flaw.","We use these paddles in the salt water of the San Juan Islands of Washington State. The paddles work very well, but we've had one serious problem. The spring steel snap buttons that secure the pole pieces together rust in salt water. They have corroded to the point of disintegration. If Stearns had only used stainless steel spring strips I'd be 100% happy.Later, I discovered that the spring steel snap buttons in my paddles are Valco #B-180 Snap Buttons. They are made of zinc-plated steel. [...] Valco also makes #B-180X Snap Buttons out of stainless steel. I ordered 6 of those and now my paddles work perfecty."
3,30 minute timeout,"The amount of information on the output format is minimal.The manual is very cryptic and poorly written. But the thing works. By trial and error I found a way to defeat the 30 minute timeout. Turn the meter OFF. Press and hold BOTH the ""select"" and ""Hz/Duty"" keys. Now turn the meter ON. Release the Hz/Duty key after 2 seconds. Then release the ""select"" key after another 2 seconds. This will allow the meter to connect to the PC and also by-pass the 30 minute automatic timeout."
3,Ann-Margret's performance makes it worthwile,"Actress turned director Lee Grant takes the reins in this musty cliche ridden ""follow your dreams"" film about a dominated, unhappy wife (Ann-Margret) trapped in a loveless marriage who dreams of going to Nashville and getting into the music business. When her sour faced spouse (William Morgan Sheppard) kicks the bucket, she tentatively begins her journey. Every possible overused hackneyed plot device comes into play as regularly as clockwork. Fortunately, Ann-Margret generates a lot of goodwill in the part and it's hard to resist her. George Segal, Brenda Vaccaro, Travis Tritt and Scott Marlowe co-star.The Echo Bridge DVD is an adequate full screen transfer."
4,An intricate true crime account,"This wasn't the first book by Mr. Olsen that I've read, and it certainly won't be the last. He skillfully weaves together the many intricate details of Stella Nickell's murders and her victims' lives into a fascinating, cohesive tale. The book is extremely well-researched and detailed. It's worth the effort to read through this complicated case. Another fine work, Mr. Olsen!"
4,"Well researched, well written","An engrossing account of the Seattle cyanide murders, Olsen's research is meticulous, his prose is well phrased, and his description of the events and characters flows unhaltingly from start to finish. All in all, an excellent read."
2,bitter almonds,i had to skip half of this book in the middle because it was so repetitive and boring. the author could have said as much in 250 pages.
4,Mother and daughter--LOVE ?,"Cyanide case--tainted capsules--product tampering--2 deaths. (Bruce & Sue)Stella Maudine Stephenson Nickell 8-7-43. She will be upfor parole Feb. 6, 2017. She is in a federal pen in California.This is another fine true crime book by Gregg Olsen.Stella is the daughter, wife, lover, mother and friend from HELL.You have NEVER met anyone like her. What a character. Noone could make her up.Her daughter put her in prison.This is a story about love, hate and death.You will not be bored.A good read."
5,Better than Dj paul and Juicy j's solo albums.,"Your crazy if you think this ain't good because he dont roll wit Three six mafia no more.The man is still doin it better than crunchy,paul,juice,chat,fraiser,lil wack and project pat.The Production is Memphis style the lyrics are still so fast you gotta rewind it.Basically if you like fast rappin on crunk beats you should buy it.P.S Stop Haytin H.C.P Wanna Be's"
5,im posting this for all the true playuerrs out daer,this one for my boys.......we been cranking this album ever SINCE it got out and we all been cranking it.......i saw this as a 2 star revieur one time i guess yall just cant see the greatness with yalls average humurn eyes...oh well.....yall just dont know fools
1,"Letdown with a capital ""L""","After hearing K-Rock's performance in his Prophet Posse (the real Prophet Posse) years, I was expecting more. His style has degraded lower than Indo G's, and that's pretty bad. The guest appearances on here didn't help to save it any. His gum-flapping ""brbrbrbrbr"" or whatever he does gets real annoying. My expectations were WAY too high (I bought this and ""K-Rock The World"" simultaneously). I was expecting performances similar to what he did on the Three 6 Mafia album ""The End,"" and what I got was the biggest waste of money ever. If you're contemplating buying this, I suggest you think twice."
4,Good Holster,This is a cheap alternative on a leather holster with a snap retention strap. The belt clip is plastic and a little on the cheap side. If the belt clip was metal this would be a very good holster.
1,bad fit,took the holster out of the package and tried my piece inside it for the fit. it ends up being too tight of a fit and the button snap wouldn't even get close enough to snap shut! the leather was way too tight and sewn about 2mm out of place.
3,Okay,"Sturdy and somewhat comfortable, and broke in easily. You must choose attire appropriately to assist with your concealed carry, as this holster is not entirely concealable."
5,You'll be singing along!,"I first saw Dan Crow when I was 4. Twenty years later, I still enjoy his songs, and I'm singing them to my niece. These are classics that will keep you laughing and singing along throughout car trips and bathtime and even dinnertime. Apples and banooonooos to you!"
4,Lightweight and Enjoyable,"My eight year old son and I watched this together when the rest of the family was out. I work as a software developer and also have a limited knowledge of electronics, so technical issues are generally pretty accessible to me. This movie was enjoyable and accessible for both of us. My son -- who can be easily bored -- had never turned away. At the end of the video he was cheering on his favorite team and was interested in getting involved in robotics projects. Viewers will definitely appreciate the scale of the work necessary to accomplish this feat, but may not see how technologies like adaptive computer vision and lidar might apply. Other than the fact that the Stanford team was software-focused, even the highest level detail about the software used was omitted. Viewers will need to seek other sources for technical detail. People who enjoyed this movie may also enjoy the Spring 2008 issue of Robot magazine, where the Darpa Urban Challenge is covered."
4,healthy mac and cheese,"If you are looking for the taste of Kraft in a healthy mac and cheese, you won't find it. If you're looking for a good tasting mac and cheese that is much better for you, you've found it. Our family likes this mac and cheese - though we like Annie's a little better. But Annie's is also quite a bit more expensive.Annie's Homegrown Organic Whole Wheat Shells & Cheddar, 6-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 12)"
5,Best Whole Wheat Mac & Cheese!,"This is the best tasting whole wheat mac and cheese out there!. All the ingredients are naturally wholesome making this a healthy and tasty dinner. Each box makes sooo much, the nutrition content is based on 1/3 of the box but I would say that there are actually about 4-5 servings once prepared.The calorie and nutrition content listed on Amazon is only for the ingredients in the box. The preparation directions call for a quarter cup milk and a quarter cup butter or margarine. If you're looking for a healthier option... I make mine with only a tablespoon of ""Olivio"" spread and about a third of a cup of ""Almond Breeze Unsweetened Original"" almond milk. This will reduce the amount of fat and calories and it comes out tasting fabulous! If the sauce is a little runny put it back on the stove for a few minutes, stiring constantly, until the sauce thickens."
1,"Way,way too salty! Yuck!","Based on what other people wrote I thought sure I'd like this. I was wrong! The pasta itself is good, but the cheese powder was so incredibly salty I threw most of the finished mac and cheese away. Now, faced with the other eleven boxes my only option seems to be use the pasta and part of the cheese powder, add my own cheese to the mix and hope it turns out ok. Which will make the whole thing much less convenient and one whale of a lot more costly!Hodgson Mill usually makes good stuff and this is a real disappointment."
3,just ok,Our kids didn't care for these and I had to give most of the case away. Won't be buying them again.
2,Healthier but not tastier,"I really wanted to like this mac 'n cheese since it has the healthier wheat pasta and is all natural, but the taste is too bland for my family. I appreciate the higher nutritional value and white cheese that is less messy for my toddler to eat, but I have had tastier whole wheat macaroni and cheese."
2,Didn't care for this,"Purchased this on July 27th. Made a box of it when it arrived for dinner. It wasn't anything like any mac and cheese I've ever eaten. Bland, texture not quite right, wasn't a smooth sauce; it just wasn't really all that appetizing for us. I've been hesitant to try another box, and since and it's been months, I doubt we really would want to eat this again. I guess it's time to find a food bank to donate it to. (I hope they like it)"
1,Mom says it is yucky,"My family eats and likes 100% whole wheat pasta, crackers and bread, so I thought we'd like this mac n cheese, too. This product tastes awful. What a bummer to own 12 boxes of yucky mac n cheese! I tried mixing it with other mac n cheese to make it tastier, but nothing can overcome the bad taste of this pasta. I finally threw the remaining Hodgson Whole Wheat Macaroni in the trash and kept the cheese packets to sprinkle on popcorn."
1,oh my God.. what a waste of film,that was the stupidest movie i have ever seen.. complete waste of time and film!!! i am a big fan of the true crime genre and i have a lot of books on dahmer and good Lord.. that was the weakest movie ever released.. whoever made it should be ashamed of releasing such [stuff]. it gave you no clue as to what went on with him and then.. it was over. bad bad bad the only reason this got one star from me is 'cus i couldn't submit it w/ NO stars
2,Not a good movie,"I did not like this movie at all! It was kinda scary at times....but I believe the people making this movie did not want to make it a horror film....Was'nt all the crimes this man commited ""Horrific""? Bad acting from the supporting cast."
1,Poor Film,"The disc paused for some inexplicable reason every 15 minutes. For events that took place in the early to mid 90's, the setting and visual quality was very poor. Lastly, if you're a homophobe, this movie is not for you."
3,The Softer Side,"I have not seen the movie yet but I know that I will enjoy it because I was reading what the director, David Jacobson, had in mind. He wanted to portray Jeffrey as a human being. A person with a serious problem. He explained that he based the story mostly on Lionel Dahmers biography of Jeffrey Dahmer, ""A Father's Story"". I know what I'm expecting to see. I don't think it's going to be as gory as some people thought."
1,GOD AWFUL PIECE OF TRASH,THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE WORST MOVIE EVER TO DISGRACE CINEMA. ITS 2 HOURS OF NO GORE AND A GUY SEDUCING AND RAPING MEN!!!!!!! I THREW THE DVD AS SOON AS I GOT DONE VIEWING IT I WA SO DISGUSTED.
1,misleading,"I honestly don't remember what the description on the back said, but I know that what I got out of it was very misleading. I expected it to be more of a doctumentary, and more about his victims, and his eventual caputure.And I agree with another customer that said that it dragged on.. I thought it was a little boring at times, and a bit confusing. They jumped from story to story with really no segway, and it seemed sometimes just randomly changed storys.As other people have said, if you're looking for gory details and blood, or just information in general on the case, this movie is not for you."
4,More of a dramatized biography,"If you're looking for a slash and gash horror movie, you're not going to get this here. It recollects on Dahmer's killing history. I would definitely recommend this movie if you have some sort of fascination with Jeffrey. I think they casted very well, the acting was good assuming it was low budget, and they did a really good job with the settings. All and all it was a great movie for any serial killer fan, but isn't really something for someone who wants a horror movie."
1,Disappointing,"after reading the synopsis of the movie and thinking it was suppose to be rather brutal, I found it to be a good movie to fall asleep on. The most graphic scene was when he was younger, in his flash backs. I expected it to be alot more than it was....Don't waste your money...."
3,Deep,"This film is not a horror dipiction of this famous serial killer. This is a serious dipiction which delves deep into what we all want to know: Why? The movie may not be the best in translation, but it certainly hints it pretty well and I found many people felt bad for him at the end which definately showed that the viewers were watching it for the psychological intent rather than scare value. Whether you hate it or love it you will definatly know much more about him when you watch this film. However I do not excuse any of the terrible actions committed by Dahmer in real life."
2,"not as good as ""bundy""","This was way too slow, and focused way too much on Jeffrey&#65533;s sexual life style. If you read about him, he was not like this at all, yes he was gay, BUT, did not try to hard to establish a long term relationship with anyone, the movie gives you the sense that he actually may have cared for someone. so if you want a 2 hr gay love story, maybe you will like this. If you are looking for the gory aspects of his life (not that they will ever show that in a movie, or could for that matter) then this is far from what you want. They did not show any of the disgusting things he did to his victims, or the true horror he was capable of. Not even the media told the full story, try to find a biography on him. You then will truly be horrified."
4,Underrated Film Which Should Be Seen,"Rather than telling the sensationalist story we all know from the newspapers amd tabloid shows, this film takes us into the mind of Dahmer by focusing on the relationships he had with a few of his victims and father. We see full afternoonns and evenings play out with those Dahmer was attracted to. We can never understand who Dahmer really was, but this is an interesting portrayal that probably comes as close as we're going to get. The characters are very well drawn and like the best films, you're left thinking about it afterwards. The lead actor is also great, adding a lot to the film, as is the actor who plays the ""one who got away"", Rodney."
2,A Fascinating Study.........,"........Into Just How Dull & Poorly Thought Out A Movie Can Be. The main character is just too damn simple-minded and idiotic to be believable. How suspicions weren't aroused before he actually got caught kinda astounds me. It may be rather accurate to the facts of the era, and even mildly disturbing to some in a few spots, but overall it's just a drawn-out tedious affair. Painful to watch. The mother is annoying beyond description with her religious harping. While she may have been that way, that doesn't mean it makes for interesting viewing. Dumber than stupid, and just a tad better than moronic."
1,Not really the actual Dahmer story!,What a boring of movie. I sat on my couch for two hours watching this piece of crap about a lonely man who works at a chocolate factory and he picks up aisans and hispanics to his apartment to secude and rape them. This guy is very sick and I'm glad they killed him. Some if it is true but the rest of it is made up. I would rather watch a real documentary of Dahmer than this stupid movie. Don't waste your time.
1,Dont Get this,I am a big fan of many murder cases. this movie plays him quite innacurately. If you want the true facts read the books about him. this just doesnt do him any justice.
2,DAHMER,IT JUST WASN'T WHAT I WANTED TO SEE. IT BOUNCED BACK AND FORTH FROM HIS AGE WHEN HE GOT CAUGHT AND WHEN HE DID THE FIRST KILLING. IF YOU DIDN'T READ THE BOOK ABOUT HIM AND YOU KNEW THIS YOU WOULD BE TOTALLY LOST. IT ALSO REFLECTS MORE ON HIS GAY LIFE STYLE THEN THE KILLINGS HE ACTUALLY COMMITTED.
1,One Star...Only for getting the credits correct & showing up,Frightening video editing...Horrifying screenplay...Eerie continuity...Ghoulish sound editing...Blood Curdling acting...Ghastly cinematography...Creepy directing. This (home) movie rates ALL the Horror Film adjectives. A total waste of celluloid. DON'T EVEN BOTHER!
1,"Lacks punch, and overall composition...","The only thing that keeps you watching it, is the overall morbid facination with real events. The editing and script was terrible and in some places hard to follow what was going on. Your expecting the whole story, but all you get is a small mix of non-linear events somewhere in between. You dont even see the events leading up to his arrest...poor acting throughout as well. I dont know what this guy's childhood was really like, but from what I seen from this flick, apparently the writer and director would make you believe any young person that's gay and has parents that are christians could end up being serial killers...pretty silly."
3,insightful,I found the movie to be very insightfulI live in milwaukee went to school just a few blocks from where everything happened the movie was good the only problem the black guy that Dahmer tis talking to throughout the movie does get away with the handcuffs on but when he returns to get the handcuffs off he is alone and what really happened is that is the guy that brings the cops to Dahmers apartment. but otherwise the movie was a good movie
1,What about the gory details?,"If I had two adjectives to describe this movie, it would be pointless and dumb. They didn't accurately portray Jeffrey Dahmer's crimes. It was about a man as you know, going to bars picking up gay men, drugging them and having sex with them. All they did was have flashbacks and him hanging out with another gay man. Nothing gory, nothing exciting, biggest waste of my time. What about the saving of body parts in the freezer? What about the eating of his victims? WHERE are these DETAILS? If the writer of this movie would like the true story of Jeffrey Dahmer, please go to A&E.com and purchase the serial killer box set. Now that is something worth your time. When the re-write comes out with all the ""true and factual"" details, let me know."
1,A complete waste of time.,"This was without a doubt one of the worst movies I've seen. I expected something that gave insight into Dahmer's life and what drove him to his acts.Instead we got snippets in flashback form that give little information.I found the format a bit confusing as it was hard to delineate when each flash back was, so it was hard to get a handle on how things progressed.There was virtually no information about Dahmer's childhood, and what could have created such a pyscho. And very little about what he actually did other than two short scenes depicting him cutting up what I think was his first victim, and using a powerdrill on the head of another victim.Overall I thought this was a terrible movie, and I would never recommend it to anyone."
5,to all the people saying this movie was horrible...,"if you buy this movie and expect an actor portraying jeffrey doing every murder hes done, chopping up bodies and eating them, than this is not the movie for you. this movie is more like an psychological insight of dahmer. what he was and why he did what he did(what sparked him to kill). you're gonna see 4 major psychological event in his life. his first murder, detailed insight of the only guy who happened to escape, a flashback why he was the way he was, and one of his plotted attempted murders. thats it. its not going to be a gruesome detailed description of every murder he's done. if you're looking for that than i rather you buy a documentary of jeffrey dahmer rather this dramaticized movie of his life. knowing the director insight of the synapsis of this movie, i think this movie is superb."
3,Bloodless,"Equal parts indie film bummer and stagey chamber drama, ""Dahmer"" admirably avoids thriller conventions and focuses instead on humanness of one of America's most notorious serial killers. That's the up side. Unfortunately, by avoiding the splatter, director David Jacobson packages Jeffrey Dahmer's life story into the trendy 70's chic and MTV alienation of a car commercial.That's not to say the film is ineffective, however. It will certainly get under your skin. Jeremy Renner's portrayal of Dahmer is especially notable for it's simultaneous blankness and inner chaos. And Artel Kayaru shines as a potential victim-the living yin to Dahmer's passive, predatory yang. But because we all know so much about these crimes, Jacobson's version often seems far too tidy and detached. I always got the distinct feeling that Jeffrey Dahmer's actual life had a little more ""Taxi Driver"" in it, and a little less Fiona Apple music video."
1,"If a movie could ever have stunted growth, this is it...","Dahmer was an OK movie, but was rather slow. I mean, it's so damned obvious that the guys/boys he brings home/meets end up hacked up for BBQ (metal fans, anyone?!) so why not work in some action, suspense, news, talk of the missing, etc.? All the movie does is show how he lured, tortured, and killed his victims, basically. Doesn't even touch on him being a cannibal. The movie has an abrupt ending, which really is it's biggest flaw. Given when the movie was made, I expected it'd touch on his hunt, capture, trial, imprisonment, and, ultimately, his demise. Very disappointing, that movie. Extremely lacking. Imagine getting dressed up in formals and your blind date picks you up for dinner in his Yugo, and you find out he's Mr. Rogers and you're going to Wendy's for dinner, when you expected opera tickets, a limo, and dinner at the Mansion. Try beating that with a greaseburger and a frosty."
1,Dumb and Dahmer,"I don't know what video company put these out but it seems last year or so, there were suddenly tons of these serial killer movies in the video stores.I don't follow serial killers at all. This movie was extremely disappointing because despite not knowing much at all about Dahmer, I think I knew 10 times as much about him as this movie presented.It's terrible acting and we don't see any motivations for his actions and there aren't much details of his crimes except that he met gay guys and killed them in his apartment.The details of the time one escaped, was questioned by police, and was returned by the police to Dahmer due to his drugged up nature are widely known and the movie didn't even demonstrate the things that are pretty common knowledge let alone show anything about him that isn't already known.See the ones about John Gacy and Ted Bundy instead. I can't speak about their accuracy but they are more entertaining than this one."
3,"A Dark, Brooding Film, Well Done","Even though it only follows one or two of the murders, I recommend this film. It is a dark and brooding piece. It can be depressing to watch as it depicts the seedier side of the gay nightlife. If you want details of the murders this is not going to satisfy you. But I did like the mood of the film, and the actor portraying Jeffrey did an excellent job. Almost making Jeffrey likable."
2,Not that good,I thought the movie was better than the other two I purchased-Green River & Henry Lee Lucas but it was still not that good
4,pretty good,i actually think this movie was done quite well.the blood is low on this movie but enough to satisfy someone who isn't looking for much.the acting is done well too.
4,Speakers,These speakers sound like it is surround sound it looks good so when people come over you wont have to hide them i think these are great speakers.Hope you like them if u have the chance to get them!

4,Great Space Maker during dry weather :),"This Thule Rooftop Cargo Bag worked very well. We read that it was ""weather resistant"" and took a gamble on leaving it out doors overnight. A real heavy rain came through and soaked all the clothes. We should have known better :) I would recommend this product. It is easy enough to install and was very secure! In the event of wet weather I recommend removing the bag from your car and placing it indoors or in the car. It would have been easy enough for two people to pull down and re-strap the next day."
3,Ripped on first use,The cargo bag is an inexpensive alternative to the hard shell cargo containers. Unfortunately mine ripped at the zipper with the first use. The instruction warn against over packing. I packed duffle bags and loose packed sleeping bags on top. I do not believe I over packed the bag but there you go. You need to be careful to really just loose pack the cargo bag which is unfortunate as you lose capacity which is what you are trying to achieve in the first place.
2,YIKES!,"Wow I thought THULE was THE company for this type of stuff. Boy was I mad after a trip from NJ to SC. The bag was mounted to my roofrack and was a little noisy (top be expected). But when I got to SC and opened the bag....the horror! The inside lining shredded and flaked off on everything! There were also 2 holes along the to seam! What a mess...and I couldn't use the bag on the way home....had to ship my stuff home! I just wrote THULE....we'll see if they come thru for the customerSept. 12, 2005 THULE sent me a replacement, an Escape 2. Great customer service....but does this mean the Escape is better? Is the Quest inferior? There was no coorespondence with the repalcement...I'll try it out this summer."
4,quality product,"We used this for the first time this summer. The bag held up well during 600+ miles of interstate driving. It did let some water through during the rain, but not real bad. Be sure to pack your items in plastic bags if they're predicting rain or go for the more expensive waterproof Thule bags.This is much more convenient than the big plastic cargo boxes since it folds up so small, goes in it's own carry bag, and fits on the closet shelf. It also goes on the vehicle quickly with four straps. Very easy to use."
5,Thule 846 Quest Rooftop Carrier - Great to Have,"Purchased this as a last minute item when we realized we did not have enough room in the van for all our stuff and kids for a road trip. We were very pleased with the Thule 846 Rooftop Cargo bag. It is soft, so its easy to get ""Stuff"" in there. We were pleasanlty surprised by the amount of items it actually held.Drove through wind and rain.. remarkbly, nothing inside was wet.Easy to hook up. Everything is built in, attaches directly to roof with straps. We found it easier to fill the bag on the ground then lift it to the roof; This option requires strong, tall men though!"
4,Excellent Choice,"Purchased this cargo bag last minute before our trip. Traveled from Detroit Mi to Phoenix Ar (5000 miles, yes some of it was via scenic route and 90mph) we had no major issues with the product.Luckily I read some other reviews prior. Correct they are not water-proof, only weather proof (water gets in). So take the time and put your stuff in a large garabage bag (55 gal works well). One other item; make sure you stuff it full; use blankets, pillows or anything soft to ensure it is full to prevent flapping.I highly recommend this product."
3,Cheap price and does the job,"I was looking for a cargo bag for a trip to Colorado at a reasonable price. I read some reviews and took a chance. There was plenty of room for storage of clothing. Like a previous review, I placed all the soft luggage into garbage bags. It was a good thing because this bag is not waterproof. The inside of the bag did get wet.I was very disappointed that the bag did not include at least 6 straps. It only had 4 straps. I used two up front and two in the rear on my stock 4Runner roof rack. It slid around laterally which I didn't like. Aside from some lateral movement, the bag stayed in place.I'd recommend this bag and will continue to use it. You just need to use a couple extra anchor straps and waterproof your items before taking off on a trip that might rain on you."
1,Not Weather Proof,"I would not buy this product again - it is not weather proof, so unless you are guaranteed it is not going to rain or snow don't get it."
1,Don't waste your money on this item!!!,"I bought this item mainly for the excellent brand name it has. The package came in, I strapped it to my roof, and filled my cargo for the Cape (I did not over fill the cargo carrier). When I went to zip the carrier, it ripped along the entire seam! This carrier is very flimsy - a few years ago I bought a generic one from Wal Mart and it was much better than this - I just couldn't find that one in my basement! If you're looking to buy one of these, make sure the zip line is very sturdy - good luck."
4,Meets Your Needs,Have nothing negative to state. Well designed. Didn't rain so I had no issue when going to the Poconos 4 hour drive at 75 MPH. Didn't need any extra fastners worked well with the four included.
