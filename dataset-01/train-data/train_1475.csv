1,This DLP TV is a Lemon,"Samsung DLP HL-R4667W TV is a lemon. I bought this model about two years ago. It got problems less one years. Service man gave me a list of parts to replace to fix the problems.1. Lamp. 2. Ballast. 3. Fans. 4. Color wheel. 5....If you like looking for trouble, go buy Samsung projection TV. Otherwise, get away from these lemons."
4,Creepy witch movie,"This film is what I was hoping ""An American Haunting"" would be more like, which I found to be disappointing after the hype. ""Conjurer"" is a lot creepier due to it's slow pace build-up in telling a quality witch story, and not so much reliance on special effects like ""American Haunting"". This is definitely worth at least a rental and a good little fright film to watch on Halloween. Not the last word in scary films but not bad, either."
2,No headphone jack,I was sadly surprised to discover when I opened the box that this radio cassette recorder has no headphone jack. I didn't know any company still made radios that way! It went back to the store.
4,Nice Radio For The Money,I own an older version of this radio and use it in my office. It has good reception and is a nice unit for the money. I have owned it for about 6 years with no complaints.
1,Pretty bad,Low quality sound and it does not work in all kind of cars. It works in my Audi A4 but it does not in my Nissan Pathfinder
2,Disappointed,I have heard of other kits like this having problems so I went and got the slightly more expensive Sony brand. I thought it might also work better with my Sony brand Discman. Really the only complaint is the power cord. It doesn't plug well into the cd player. I had to end up using a rubber band to keep it the power going to the unit. Even then if you move the cd player much you still have to adjust the power cord to get it to play again. I just thought since both were Sony brand that they should work a lot better together than they did.
1,Didn't work.,"Immediately after purchasing it, I realized it is not compatible with the tape player in my 2005 Ford Expedition. Beware Ford drivers. It will spit this tape right back atcha....."
3,car connecting pack,"I gave as a gift ,so I do not know how it performed sorry I will have to ask and see how they are doing with it,Thank you Doug Owen."
4,great alternative,... to a really expensive set. This was economical and fit the needs of the younger kids. I am still hoping to find replacement pieces though. It could use a little more instuctions as well. Some of the features are more complicated than the guide gives instructions for.
4,Lots of fun for our ten year old son,This is a fun way for our son to play chess. The only problem has been keeping up with the pieces. We usually keep up with pieces of things like this but for some reason this one has been an issue. And my son really loves the game so I need to order some replacement parts. The fact that we have lost the pieces is not the fault of the maker.....it is a fun way to play chess especially for a ten year old boy who LOVES medieval things AND chess! Definitely a GREAT gift!
3,A Marvel fan must-see!,"An excellent look at the vintage approach to comic book heroes. The Mighty Thor, Sub-Mariner, and Spider-Man. The animation is, at times, odd. But the voices and stories are definitely timeless."
5,A Wonderful Example,"He showed me a wonderful example of the Christian life. His humble heard and his daily life with God was so challenging. While I was reading this book, I could also humble myself before Him and also before people. Whenever I feel so exhausted, I recall this book and gain new strength."
3,Standard puff piece for FBI lab,"This 1995 book is a standard puff piece for the FBI lab, spending 380 pages without one negative word about anything at the lab -- all testing is rigorously and honestly done, and the defense is always informed of exculpatory evidence. Fisher's starry-eyed view of the FBI lab has been disproven by recent revelations in the press and in books such as John Kelly's _Tainting Evidence_.This book does provide an interesting and readable account of the different techniques used by the FBI to analyze evidence, including many accounts of how those techniques solved real cases. On the plus side, the book is very well-organized, with each chapter covering a separate area of the lab -- chemistry, explosives, fingerprint, document, etc. The book includes a helpful index.On the negative side, there is not one drawing or picture in the whole book. These would have been very helpful in visualizing the instruments, techniques and results Fisher describes."
5,"Great for Quincy, Law & Order, NYPD Blues fans, only better","This book is well written and thoroughly engrossing. Not normally a non-fiction reader, I found I could not put Hard Evidence down. It is easy to understand, easy to read and filled with thorough explanations on cases I have heard of from the newspapers. Each chapter deals with a specific area of the lab so you can pick and choose your interests or read cover-to-cover as I did. Read about the lastest technologies and the people who put them to use to solve a variety of crimes. Highly recommended."
5,"GREAT FRAGANCE, BETTER PRICE","I really recomended this fragance, I buyed as a girf for my mother in low and her love it"
1,Must Have If You Like Let Downs!!!!,Big Tad fan. Can't get enough until I heard this crap. Break up Hog molly and reunite Tad. This album is lame!!
5,Superb!,"I bought this CD several weeks ago and thought it was absolutely superb! I was not only impressed by Paul and Artie'sharmonic interweaving, but Simon's folksy and innovative guitar playing was what hooked me to the folk guitar many years ago, and in this performance I was thrilled by his talents.I didn't think 'The Borders of our Lives' would adapt toa live recording, but they performed it with angelic presence.I thoroughly recommend this CD. It exemplifies perhaps a dying breed of true artists who couldreally perform music on stage (S&G; used to busk in Leicester Square, London, in the early 1960's) and not the instant coffee variety of artists who are created and groomed by the PR wizadry of music companies."
4,"Great, but nothing special","This CD comes 15 years late: Throughout these years over a dozen concert CDs of the duo have been released through labels different to CBS, Geffen and Warner.This CD has a great sound, a magnificent ""Hazy shade of winter"" acoustic version but that's it. The most valuable things in a CD of this kind would be new songs never recorded buy the duo, and them talking about aneccdotes. But you won't find much of it here, except for ""You don't know where your interest lies"".If you buy other live CDs from the duo (Far East, Live in Ohio, Live in Haarlem -Holland, Live in Monterrey....) you'll find great songs that they never recorded together (Red Rubber Ball, That silver haired daddy of mine, Cuba si Nixon No) and wonderful speeches (like the one where Garfunkel introduces ""a new song we just finished called bridge o.t.water which I hope you like it"".).In short: This is a nice CD for everyone, but nothing special for Simon and Garfunkel collectors."
5,My favorite!,"I am an avid Simon and Garfunkel LP collector - which I unfortunatly don't get to listen to as often as I'd like, but this is the CD I listen to when I need my S&G fix! I love love love live and acoustic versions of music because to me, an artist is not a true artist unless he or she can perform live and still rock it! This is the CD to buy if you want to hear the true art of Simon and Garfunkel. Another suggestion is the Greatest Hits album which I have to admit, at the age of 22, I made fun of my mom for owning this CD up until I turned 17 and discovered their brilliance!"
4,Very similar to the Central Park concert,This is the usual folksy type live concert with Simon or Garfunkel discussing the background of the song before it is performed. I had to do a double check when listening to this CD. It is so similar to the Central Park concert recording that I thought someone had mistakenly put the Central Park concert CD in the jewel case by mistake. This should not deter you from buying this live recording since there are the usual variations in playing style that make alternate versions entertaining to listen to.
1,NOT THE COMPLETE PERFORMANCE,"Great show. Beautiful sound quality. However, I've given this disc a 1 star rating because Sony did not present the entire concert here.I believe the producers of this release excised at least one of the performances from the concert. Red Rubber Ball has been cut-out, and perhaps others. Ball is available on the Old Friends box set.The track deletion makes one wonder whether Sony did this intentionally, so ""completists"" would have to purchase the Old Friends box to get the ""whole"" show. If this was a commercial decision, it wouldn't be surprised..."
1,Wrong mascot,"My biggest problem with these sheets is that I go to that school, and our mascot is most definitely NOT a hog."
2,"Uninspired performances, mediocre recordings","Unless I miss my guess, this material is at least two decades old, and probably in the public domain by now. There are 20 tracks performed by eight different obscure polka artists. Recording quality is far from superb. On some of the Deutchmeisters tracks, all the microphones seem to have been placed near the drums, making it difficult to hear anything else. Some instruments on the Polka Padre tracks seem to have been full of water, judging from the gurgling. Watch out for the repackaging. The CD says Polka Dance Party Volume 1, but the cover says Polka's Greatest Hits Volume 1... Don't be trapped into buying Polka's Greatest Hits if you already have Polka Dance Party, or vice versa. A small example of the manufacturer's carelessness is that, on my copy, the back cover (the one that's harder to fix) was upside down. For the best polkas, stick with Joey Miskulin, Frank Yankovic, Jimmy Sturr, and Eddie Blaconczyk."
4,a few great tracks,"you may want to get the download the best tracks. A few of th tracks are epic, the rest are soso."
3,Just average.,"Aleve helps me for my back pain but doesn't seem to help with most common everyday things like headaches.I alternate between Tyenol and Aleve. When one stops working, I switch back to the other. This is just about the same as Tyenol. Aleve may be a little bit better but it is more expensive.I would recommend this if you take Tyenol and it has stopped helping because your body has become adjusted to it. Aleve seems to be harder on the stomach so be sure to take with food.Another reviewer said it helped with her menstrual pains but it doesn't help me with mine. This does help me better than Tyenol with lower back pain."
5,The most effective product I've found for treating headaches,"Everyone on my mother's side of the family (including me) seems to have a very high resistance to pain medication, so most things don't work unless taken in two or three times the recommended dosage. For years I took double doses of Tylenol for my headaches, but one day I felt a headache coming on while I was away from home without any pain meds with me. A friend gave me an Aleve, and that one tablet worked wonders! Within a very short time, my headache was gone. I've used Aleve ever since, and usually just one tablet does it - I only need to double the dose for very severe, persistent headaches. I'd definitely recommend this product as an excellent pain reliever. I've also found that it relaxes me and helps me sleep if taken before bed."
1,Horribly made!,"I have already returned one of these in exchange for another because the product did not latch properly. The product I received is worse than the one I exchanged it for! It still does not latch properly AND the inside is coming apart from the box. It looks cool on the outside if you don't mind that it does not latch or that the inside is falling apart. It was the only box I could find that had the look I wanted for a gift. I knew it was inexpensive, but I hoped it would at least work properly. This is just expensive kindling. Horrible horrible HORRIBLE product!"
4,Nice Presentation,Extremely nice gift wrap box. The box can make an average bottle look good! I found it to be surprisingly as it appeared.
4,Nice item.,"I bought two of these to hold the 2 bottles of Mead that I am giving for Christmas gifts this year. I wanted something to hold them that had a medieval flare. These boxes fit the bill. They came in and are lightweight but feel like they are solidly constructed. They are not made of thick wood. The wood staining is nice and even throughout each box. They both latch easily. The strap on the top is firmly attached and is a pretty thick piece of leather. I gave them 4 stars because one of the boxes' decorative hardware on the front is crooked. The other box is fine. I bought these boxes for effect and they succeeded in that and are functional. For the price, I would buy these again."
4,Butterflies (Science Natures Guide),"A wonderful collection of pictures of various butterflies, this book is a watchers dream. It lists the environment that you may find each of the butterflies in as well as gives instructutions that may help one to view the butterflies in nature. I have used this book in my classroom to introduce butterflies to my students and they loved it!"
3,Leaves some of the story out!,"My two year old checked this book out at our local library and he loved it (also loved One Rainy Day). So I bought it for him, and decided to get the boardbook instead of the hardcover. But, the stories are not the same, since the boardbook leaves some details out of the story. The hardcover story is much better."
5,Tajine Bowl,I ordered four of these bowls for Christmas presents. The first two bowls arrived broken so I had to return them. The other two bowls arrived in perfect condition. They are absolutely beautiful and quite large. My son and daughter will love them.
4,Excellent Survey of Mathematical Tools,"This text acts as a well-rounded introduction and overview of much of the mathematics underlying modern physics. While far from rigorous, the physics student will come away with a good understanding of how to use a wide variety of mathematical tools. This book is a necessity for every theoretical physicist. When used in a course (probably advanced undergrad or beginning grad), it should definitely be supplemented with more thorough texts, such as Geometry of Physics by Frankel. After such a course, one should be fully prepared for texts such as Spin Geometry by Michelson & Lawson, and String Theory by Polchinski. As for the mathematics presented in the book, go to one of the many excellent intro books to algebraic topology (Fulton, Munkres, Massey, Bott & Tu) and fibre bundles (Steenrod, Husemoller) for proper treatments of the subjects."
1,Too many errors to be useful for study,"Reading all the glowing reviews of this book, I wonder whether the reviewers actually tried to use the book to understand the material, or just checked the table of contents. There are so many misprints, throughout, that one wonders if the book was proofread at all. Some of the mistakes will be obvious to every physicist - for example, one of the Maxwell equations on page 56 is wrong - others are subtle, and will confuse the reader. The careful reader, who wants to really understand the material and tries to fill in the details of some of the derivations, will waste a lot of time trying to derive results that have misprints from intermediate steps which have different misprints! Some chapters are worse than others, but the average density of misprints seems to be more than one per page.The book might be useful as a list of topics and a ""road map"" to the literature prior to 2003, but that hardly justifies the cost (or the paper) of a whole book."
1,Needs an online list of errata. Unacceptable.,"I am surprised that amidst all the glowing reviews, there is only one reviewer who points out the unacceptable number of errata in this book. A couple of misprints here and there throughout the whole book (or even per chapter) would be acceptable, but I agree with the other reviewer that at times, the misprints are as much as one per page. In addition to the error on page 56 (equation 1.241d should have curl B), here are just a few that I found (I'm just going to list the page numbers): 8, 9, 21, 28, 66, 84, 179, 186, 192, 193, 196, 203, 245, 247, 255.... Look, I could go on and on. But this is not my job. I certainly didn't pay 60+ bucks for this. Physicists deserve better than this. What this book really needs (attention: author or publisher) is an online database of errata. That's the least they could do."
5,Acoustic Donnie aka Donnie Unplugged,"Donnie's ""Unplugged"" album. When I first listened to this, I liked it but was not on fire for it. Over time, however, I have warmed up more to this disc. Ah Leah is probably one of the low points (but still OK), but some of the other remakes are very good. The new stuff is the treasure of this album. My favorites are Holdin My Heart in Your Hands, I'd Rather Go Blind, and the long version of Amazing Grace (yes, Amazing Grace). This is a somewhat melancholy album, thankfully Amazing Grace finishes it off in a somewhat upbeat fashion. The collaboration with other artists on this album works well too. If you are a true Donnie fan, you will love this album. I'm glad he didn't try slow versions of Love Will Rock You or Minnie the Moocher!"
2,Exploiting elements,"2 1/2A brisk pleasantness is about all that can pervade these tired themes-no matter what format Glass reworks his redundant musical motifs around, the composer's limitations sound prevalent."
1,the descent into self-parody is complete...,"The outer movements of Glass's ""Lewis and Clark"" Piano Concerto are merely bland and barely distinguishable from those of his ""Tirol"" Concerto, but it's the central ""Sacagawea"" movement that would almost be hilarious if it weren't meant to be taken seriously. R. Carlos Nakai has the unenviable job of noodling around on a Native American flute made to sound like an out-of-tune recorder playing Glass's unidiomatic and inane little ditties in a shameless attempt at P.C. multiculturalism that falls flat on its face. The descent into self-parody is complete with the Harpsichord Concerto, a ridiculous trifle of a piece possibly indicating that Philip Glass will crank out a concerto for anyone willing to pay for one. Coming soon: the Bongo Concerto?"
2,Yawn . . .,"As is the case with Scrawl, which this band reminds me of, I can't understand why anyone would want to listen to this murky snoozefest. Guitars chug along with nary a melody or catchy riff, vocals are flat, and the mix is all wrong. Generally unimaginative guitar rock that I am loathe to label ""indie."" Are the lyrics good? Who knows -- I didn't listen long enough to find out. Why not listen to something interesting instead?"
3,The American WildTurkey,"The book is well done and deals with important issues surrouding turkey hunting by an obviously passionate turkey hunter, but he spends very little time with actual hunts. It is not a how-to book in any sense of the word."
4,Works as advertised,Completely fixed the rattling when driving with no trailer. Have to use real wrench with a long handle to get it tight enough to really work.
5,"gay american ""wuthering heights""","a beautifully written story of love and hate going to the extremes which resembles ""wuthering heights"" in more than one respect; semi-articulate passion in a deserted land bordering on madness and advancing slowly into a near intolerable showdown. it's amazing with which composure Purdy manages to tell this pitch black ""romantic tale""; never corny, never embarassing, a perfectly clear, simple plot and language. Highly recommended (for everybody by the way, gay or not gay)"
3,"Grim, loopy, interesting","While it is both beautifully and repetitively descriptive of desire and power, I found Narrow Rooms to have a stony quality (in several senses of the word stony). Even though I'm only a generation removed from Purdy and not two or three, I had to keep in mind that the book was first published 30 years ago and that this is a writer, like Vidal, of a certain age, with a period perspective. While the depiction of desire is real, it is shadowed and joyless. Purdy is always interesting, but I'm reminded of how lucky I am to have come of age post-Stonewall (if barely)."
5,The Boys: Purchased at Amazon.com,"This book is absolutely overwhelming! I can't imagine trying to research a book of this size. The author did a fantastic job. In many ways it was so difficult to get through this book, much of it seemed like a litany of horror. I'm glad that I kept reading though, because the story of the post-war experiences of the boys (and girls) was so meaningful. A book well worth reading."
5,a book of tragedy and yet hope.,"I felt guilty when I needed to stop reading this powerful book, for one MUST continue reading to the last page just as the BOYS continued their stuggle to survive."
5,Awesome tribute band,Really awesome CD from these ladies. I look forward to upcoming releases. DVD included was really good too. Hopefully they tour really soon in the U.S.
3,A good disc for those who want to meet a female guise of Iron. Nothing exceptional addition to bassist.,Simply because it is a product worth buying.found nothing to discredit the purchase. It was exactly what I expected.Yes I recommend to anyone who likes rock and want to meet other derivations or another immersion in the world of cover bands.It is noteworthy that the bassist plays very well as a beautiful woman kkk
5,It's the Lion King,"Having the full collection of view options is key. I can bring this to friends/family/parties and it can be played. Plus, for my friends, this is reliving childhood. You can't put a price on that (although this price is spectacular)"
5,This is one of excellent books of categorical data models,"I have enjoyed the ""Introductory Statistics A Modelling Approach"" by J. K. Lindsey very much, then it has been inducing me going to search more statistical books of J. K. Lindsey. Of course, I could not miss out this ""Modelling Frequency and Count Data"", as an actuarial student, I am so beneficial from reading and studying this text. It presents the standard models and many newly developed ones in a language that can be immediately apllied in many modern statistical computing package.I recommend J. K. Lindsey's books to everyone who needs statistical knowledge and technique. ""Modelling Frequency and Count Data"" is an excellent book that you can't miss out!"
5,Great Flavor with a lot of heat,"This hot sauce is quite spicy, with a nice rich flavor. It isn't just full of vinegar like Tabasco sauces are. It is hot but not so hot that you can't taste the full flavor of the peppers. It has a nice smoky chipotle taste to it. It is really spicy so it isn't for the faint of heart when it comes to eating hot sauces, but if you like it spicy it is certainly worth the money."
2,Awful stick,"I bought this to play Xbox fighting games, and it would not read any of my fast inputs. I ended up building my own fighting stick, and using the PCB board inside to convert my stick's signals to XBox. I would advise avoiding at all costs, unless you want the PCB board which is actually very nice."
2,"Great Pictures, Burdensome Text","The presentation and layout of this book are striking and visually stimulating, but the text is just the opposite. From the first paragraphs, Leffingwell seems to assume that the reader knows the entire history of International Harvester, so he seems to just fill in obscure details. The text wanders forward and backwards through history and is almost impossible to follow. It is very difficult to trod through. I do not recommend this book."
4,Works great,This works just as well as the original Nikon version but at a fraction on the cost of the official Nikon one...plus it also has the car charger as well as the house charger.
5,East meets West musically with fantastic results,"This is more than two hours of acclaimed sitar master Ravi Shankar grooving with a variety of Western orchestral instruments in both classical Western and classical Indian musical settings.The former includes two concertos for sitar and orchestra; the latter includes two ragas and other traditional works.Shankar is joined by plenty of heavy hitters. The conductors for the two concertos are Andre Previn and Zubin Mehta; Yehudi Menuhin and Jean-Pierre Rampal are the top classical music soloists to join Shankar on other pieces.And the creativity to write the two concertos? Incredible.And, the recording quality on these two CDs, including the degree of stereo separation on the smaller instrumented pieces, is great. For example, the Morning Love had fantastic sound, and separation, between the sitar and tabla. Made me feel like I was on a rug about six feet away from two real performers, just as my speakers are."
5,Goodlooking Watch,This watch is great to look at. It is very easy to read the dial because of the blue face and also very comfortable to wear. I love it and wear it every day to work. I also got a lot of compliments on it.
3,Solid value for the money...but,"I had been looking for years for the ""everyday"" watch--something beyond the plastic/Nike of youth; something a bit more upscale and still at a reasonable price. This one looked like the winner...but I forgot to determine if the dark face with no numbers was a deal breaker. It was. Nice watch, but lesson learned and another Seiko, with traditional face, came shortly after Christmas and was the winner."
3,Disappointed,Disappointed in the product. The amount of light and overall size is perfect. However it comes with three sections that screw together that house all the wiring. Two of the three pieces had stripped threads so they do not stay together. I did not want to send it all back so I had to super glue the middle section. The section that screws into the base does not tighten so the lamp leans a bit.
2,Not as pictured,"I bought this to replace one of a pair that I had. The picture is not what I recevied. The lamp I got was taller and not as well designed. By the time I unpacked it and realized it was not the same,I just kept it because I really really needed a lamp for task lighting. But I wouldnt buy from this seller again. The lamp you get is not whats pictured. And with online shopping, if I cannot rely on the photos, its a waste of my time and money."
1,Bulb lasted 60 days,"Junk, should have paid for the better brand. Bulb dead after 60 days.The other reviews were correct in warning of impending dissapointment."
1,don't buy,"don't buy. nice stand, very bright, worked 2 days!!!!, bought replacement bulb, still does not work. Not worth a penny."
2,Cheesy base!!!!,The light is fine but the rod does not screw on the base instead it just sits on it with a little bit of pressure. A slight touch and the rod almost falls off of the base. The base should be redesigned to have the rod screw into it for stability otherwise it just falls. I give it 2 stars for the light it puts out but DO NOT have it around kids AT ALL. Just a word of caution from a mom!
2,Short Cord,"I would normally rate this product with five stars except for the skimpy, chincy short (five foot) cord. It was necessary to buy an extention cord to use this lamp where I wanted it. As best I can tell the type of cord that comes with this lamp sells for $0.39 per foot retail. I would guess the wholesale price to be much less. Come on manufacturer of the Grandrich ES-101, raise your price by $0.50 and put at least a six foot cord on this and make it a quality product. Sorry, can't recommend this product."
1,It worked for two minutes then died,"Because of the way it is packaged, the lamp comes with a lot of excess wires that you must stuff inside of the lamp's body and this might cause the wires to break. The metal clip to hold the lamp came in wrong size and the bulb was shoved in when packaging so I could not install the blub properly. I think the light came on for few seconds while I use my hand to push the blub in the correct position but it couldn't hold the blub byself and two minutes later it died and I have no ideas how to revive it.It's a knock off of much better made Bell Howell lamp that looks identical to this one."
1,won't last even a year...,"Similar to many others here, who I should have listened to in the first place, I found this to be very cheaply made in terms of the threading on the pipes and the need to cram a ridiculously long wire inside of one of them. Since it was used as a grow lamp for an indoor fern, it operated for about 4 or 5 months on a timer that was set only for normal daylight hours. Then the bulb went mostly dark. I did find replacement bulbs online, but that didn't turn out to be the problem. I am assuming it is the ballast, as others have found. It is now in the trash."
5,GREAT LAMP,"I've been using this lamp for over 3 years now (purchased thru Amazon), with no problems whatsoever. It works great. Original bulb as well. I did purchase a replacement bulb thru Amazon at the time of purchase, and so far have had no need of it. Works great. Couldn't ask for better in a floor lamp for reading. Sturdy as well. Good purchase."
4,A magic lamp!,"This is not a lamp you buy for fashion but for usefulness, especially for those of us who need EXCELLENT light on a book, or needlework, etc. It is exactly what I needed."
3,Its bright! but falls short in a couple of ways,"This lamp is very bright, so much so that I have to angle it backward or my family complains about nuclear annihilation in the family room and the glare in the tv. I was surprised at the amount of assembly that was required. Also, it isn't anything special to look at. The flexible plastic neck of the lamp looks especially cheap. That said, it is a low priced lamp, and it is providing energy efficient illumination, so my husband says that for the price, it is good value."
2,Think Twice,"This lamp fell apart before I got it turned on. The pole does not fit together properly. Even when you think it's screwed together it will simply come apart..for instance..should you decide to move the lamp. BTW, at that point the heavy base will fall on your toe. For the cheap price, you get a cheap lamp.PS: Super Glue helps. Don't buy this lamp without it."
2,Find a different lamp,"Total junk, does not screw together properly, threads get all crossed up, horrible design, I gave it away as soon as I got it put together, cheap looking, no dimmer which is annoying because it is too bright and gives off a weird color light ... do not buy"
4,I like it,"After putting together three of these lamps from other dealers, I FIND THIS THE BETTER OF THEM.. Easy to assemble and works on the first try.."
1,Waste of money,This lamp lasted all of one day and hasn't worked since. It sits in one of my rooms waiting for a miracle.I suggest Amazon delete product from its offerings.Roy Wagner
4,Sale price,"I bought the ES-101 in gray at Big Lots on sale for $19.99. Big Lots regular price is $29.99, way cheaper than amazon or other websies. I've only had it 2 days so I can't really say too much about it."
2,"Good product, poor Amazon service","I am very pleased with this product. I would give 5 stars to it. But I am not pleased with Amazon service. There was a promotion with this purchase, a free magazine subscription through Amazon. Amazon never honor this promotion. After several contacts with Amazon coustomer support I finally give up! Every time they would promise me to resolve the issue within 10 to 15 days and many 10 to 15 days have been passed and I still not yet get any feed back."
1,Returned: did not work!,"Returned for refund: The housing for the bulb was faulty. The bulb was delivered installed in the lamp. If I wiggled the bulb and applied pressure then I had light, but only worked for about 30 seconds. Then no amount of wiggling or replacing with a new bulb would get the light to work. Amazon return was very easy."
1,Poor Quality Control,The lamp looked great in the description but I had to return it and the replacement due to defective workmanship/quality control. I do not recommend buying this lamp.
1,Just 1 second worked and gone...,"After I received this itme, I assembled this and nothing's happened.While I tried to make it tuned on, It just turned on about 1 second andthen gone...Also I want to mention that this built quality is very cheap, low...and the one I received was looked like "" floor sample"" ( under bottom,lots of dust and scratches...)I repacked it and sent it back for a refund."
5,Review,"My dissertation research includes interviewing children and I found this book to be extremely insightful and helpful! I would recommend this book to anyone that is thinking about (or in the process of) working on research with children, especially in the sciences."
2,The originals were better,"This CD, also titled 60th Anniversary Greatest Hits, should not be confused with a Sony/Columbia release, Frankie Yankovic and His Yanks' Greatest Hits. The current CD was not recorded on the 60th anniversary of anything. It is simply snitches and snatches of material originally released on vinyl in the 50s, 60s, and 70s. At least eight LPs from Columbia, and two from RCA, are represented. The six oldest tracks (3,4,5,7,15,19) are monophonic, except for some recently added reverb. A couple of others, including the mislabeled Ohio Polka (it's really Cherry Polka) are also mono, even though they came from an LP originally available in stereo. The quality of most of the tracks is poor. Compared to the originals, or to most any other CD, you'll have to crank up both the volume and the bass to get a decent sound. There are much better CDs by this artist, notably Songs of the Polka King Volumes 1 and 2."
4,If You Lived in Colonial Times,"I enjoyed this book. I have a first grader and a second grader. We have been studying colonial America and I thought this might be a good book to bring the times to life. It was much longer than I had anticipated but that's just fine. We read out of it during the whole time we studied the colonies. I think they learned quite a few things (as did I). It's not the ""fun,"" simplistic story that I had thought it would be but it contained a lot of interesting information. I would definitely recommend it."
5,An excellent Cheesecake cookbook,"The Book of Cheesecakes is a totally dependable guide to making a very good cheesecake. It has many kinds of cheeses from cream cheese to ricotta, feta, cottage cheese, Neufchatel and maybe mascarpone. The cakes are savory or sweet, or specific to holidays and ethnicities. All come out perfectly. I have never had a cheesecake that didn't work from this cookbook. I recommend it highly."
5,CANNIBALIZED,"IT'S WELL SPENT MONEY. I'M GETTING TO OLD TO HANDLE THE MOSH PITS, SO THESE 3 DVD'S GIVES ME A CHANCE TO SEE CANNIBAL IN CONCERT WITHOUT GETTING ALL BRUISED TO HELL. I DID GET TO SEE GEORGE WHEN HE WAS LEAD VOCALS FOR MONSTROSITY IN MIAMI FLORIDA. HE'S A REAL COOL DUDE. NOT AS INTIMADATING AS HE LOOKS AND SOUNDS ON STAGE. HAVE FUN WATCHING THESE 3 DVD'S THERE EXCELLENT. GET CANNIBALIZED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Awesome DVD,"My boyfriend is a huge Cannibal Corpse fan and I heard that this DVD was very highly rated and just an overall good buy with tons of concert footage, etc. So I bought it for him for Christmas and he loves it. It was a good buy, a quick and smooth purchase. Recommend it for fellow metalheads. \m/"
5,Everything a Cannibal Corpse fan would want,This DVD set has everthing a fan of this band would want. First Disc 1 has one of the best history segment I have seen since Iron Maiden's Early Years. It talks in great detail the beginnings of the band and each describing each album almost fully.(KIss should do a histry like this) Disc 2 has great live and videos through the years.Disc 3 is also entertaining and quite amusing at times. Don't pass this one by!!!!
3,Good quality.,"This ring is a good quality toe ring. It is the strongest I've purchased.I like the nice detail in the writing. It is small and beautifulThe con on this is the ring's manageability. Since the metal is strong and sturdy, it's hard to adjust the size to put on and take off."
1,Can't rate any lower...,"This is a piece of junk shredder. Had only a little while before it broke. Found out that the main drive gear is plastic and when it breaks, you are out of luck as no parts for these units are available. I suggest you look more before you buy this one."
5,Vitally Important Book,"Given the remarkable growth in apocalyptic speculation, especially since September 11, this book is extremely important. It is important because it reminds us that the speculation surrounding the end of the world has been with us for centuries. Not only that, but it has been a weapon to denigrate other movements and groups. For all those millions of Americans who are buying evangelical books on how September 11 fulfils Biblical prophecy, this book is an absolute must."
1,A Jaded Viewpoint Of An Unenlightened Historian,"Mr. Newport appears to approach his study of other people's opinions on the book of Revelation purely from a materialistic point of view. Why would anyone want to buy a book about a world-weary viewpoint concerning substance that is of a spiritual nature? All one has to do is read four verses from Revelation (1:3; 22:7,18-19) to realize that it is a supernatural book, which Newport smugly disavows. Newport's book is disguised as an ""intellectual"" examination, but it is truly one of the worst pieces of overpriced nonsense on the market. Save your money for other things, unless you need an extravagant doorstop."
5,Very accurate description of items,The book was exactly how they described it. They also got the item shipped very quickly. I would use their service again.
4,Universal Abbott & Costello Collection,This is a great collection of Abbott & Costello movies from Universal. I had bought one of the sets from the Franchise Collection and it was junk. It keep freezing on me while in play mode. Some of the discs on this set looked like they were a little scratched in spots but they still played flawlessly. Now if I could only find the other Abbott & Costello movies on DVD from the other studios I could complete my collection. Anyone know when MGM will release Rio Rita on DVD? When whatever studio will release Abbott & Costello Meet Captain Kidd on DVD? There are so many DVD releases of Africa Screams and Jack And The Beanstock I don't know which ones are the good ones to get? And finally is there a collection of all the Abbott & Costello show episodes in one DVD collection?
2,"Great Packaging, really grainy picture","While it's great to have these movies all in one spot, I am saddened by the fact that the picture looks super grainy. You would think they would have spent a few bucks to give you a better transfer. If you look at the re-released Three Stooges collection (done by year), that really looks clean, crisp and wonderful with no ""gainy artifacts"" in the picture. These A & C movies are so full of grain in the faces that they are almost unwatchable. If the grain issue can be cleared up then this would be a 5 star set."
5,classic comedy,"This set is classic comedy at it's finest. I would but abbot and costello up against any comedian today and they would come out on top. No raunchiness here, as there comedy was always top notch! Many of today's comedians could learn a thing or two from this classic duo. I know some of today's youth might not get the jokes and such but it is just simply genius and hillarious.I orginally watched abbott and costello when I was a teenager in the 80's on WPIX TV out of NYC every Sunday morning/early afternoon.This set is a complete set of the universal years. Now I just need to find the non universal stuff and have even more laughs."
5,Great,Absolutely love the collection I purchased. Still watching them. Recommend to anyone! The product was better than I thought it would be. Well worth the money.
4,Still missing a few...............,"Great collection. But still does not include at least 6 titles. Rio Rita, Abbott & Costello Meet Captain Kidd, Jack & the Beanstalk, Africa Screams, Abbott & Costello in Hollywood, and Dance with me Henry. Maybe one day they will release the ENTIRE A&C movie collection."
2,VIDEO,The videos were intened to be a Christmas gift.They were supposively shipped Dec 4th.I received them Jan 7th.Lokking back to comments i now Know this was a common problem from this vendor.
2,not whos on first but whom,"Greetings fellow amazonians on my vacation this year I went to see my grandfather in durham nc. I bought this as a gift for him because he is a hugh a & c fan. To bad he was also a english professor at duke and also a drunk because we would watch these movies together at night while he drank himself silly and he would scream at the tv everytime one of these idiots would use incorrect grammar. Finally one night when we were watching ""who's on first"" my grandfather became so irate that he flung his bottle of wild turkey through his tv screen because they wouldn't use the word whom. Now his says I need to by him a new tv and some more wild turkey. Thanks amazon for making me owe my grandfather"
5,Tom's Mom,"I loved watching Abbott and Costello movies as a kid. Now I have a six year old son and thought he might get a kick out of some of their antics too. He loves them!! It's nice to be able to share something with my son that I enjoyed so much when I was a kid. Abbott and Costello's humor is timeless; just good, clean, silly fun!"
5,Abbot & Costello,This is a great collection. I would highly recommend it to any classic film buff. Attractive packaging and highly entertaining extras
5,Abbott and Costello,I have really enjoyed watching Abbott and Costello again. They are as funny now as when I was a kid.
1,Abbott and Costello span generations,I had purchased this a couple of years ago and my daughter and grandaughter just love to watch Abbott and Costello - so I purchased it for them to have for their very own.
1,Double-dipping is an insult to fans!,"I agree with several others here who chastised Universal for double-dipping with ""It Ain't Hay"" on this release. It's a slap in the face for all the fans who bought all the previous releases, as I have. I'm not spending over $80 for one film. All this does is make Universal (and all the other studios that do this, Paramount and Warner included) look very bad, and confirms my decision to stop giving these arrogant companies my money by not ""upgrading"" my entire DVD collection to Blu-Ray and buy a good upconverting 1080p DVD player instead."
2,Extortion,"Having just completed my Universal four-volume A&C Collection earlier this year, and trying to complete my collection of the work they did at other studios, I feel particularly cheated in light of how crammed with filler Volume 4 was. Could they have slipped ""It Ain't Hay""in place of a lame documentary? Sure, but then what do they sell for Christmas this year? Shame on them."
1,It's a Rip!,"It is really a rip off when Universal ""re-packages"" the same discs and slip one extra movie and a nice collectors box to get you to spend another 80 bucks. That is about the same amount I spent on the first 4 volumes of the ""Franchise Collection"". Now don't get me wrong if you haven't yet purchased the ""Franchise Collection"", go for it. I would but not after being ask to re-buy the same movies."
1,Don't be fooled!,"These are the same movies previously released (sans one), except worse in quality! A&C MEETS FRANKENSTEIN has the wrong title cards which lose some of the opening animation and some of the ending footage from when they jump in the water. This is an inferior product!"
3,false advertising!!!,this is Not the complete Abbott and Costello movies missing eight movies two are not on DVD at all good collection but i wanted all or the complete Abbott and Costello collection
4,Anyone noticed the change in titles???,"Took a look at the old set for comparing. ""A& C Meet Frankenstein"" had ""UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL PRESENTS"" while the new set had ""REALART PICTURES PRESENTS""Anyone have any idea why they changed the titles for this one film?Even the single release of this had ""UNIVERSAL-INTERNATIONAL PRESENTS"".Just wondering how many oters in the set were changed to""REALART PICTURES PRESENTS""Thanks in advance"
5,"Abbott and Costello Collection, great to have these on DVD",We are really enjoying the older movies and I would rate this at the top even for young people
3,six fat dutchmen greatest hits,"Great songs, lousy sound quality. How come when music is moved from an lp or tape or some other source to a cd, they have such a hard time getting good quality sound?"
2,"My fave polka band, badly recorded.","I grew up hearing the Six Fat Dutchman live and on local radio. They are the best.That said, it is a travesty to hear a recording as bad as these. It is possibly the worse job of miking I have ever heard on a commercial product. Even high school band concert recordings are not this poorly done. Sometimes, the vocalist sounds like he is in an echo chamber, far, far away. Other times, he is just far, far away. And, the tuba is about halfway between the singer and the mike. I have always admired their tuba player, but there is too much tuba in a lot of these cuts.Volume 2 is just as bad."
5,The Title Says it ALL,This has to be one of the best salsa albums around. Ruben and Willie are two of a kind. Their work together has not been matched by anyone. You will not find another album with great recorded hits from the past as this one. You'll love it as much as I do.
4,Walden as a Texas Farce,"I bought a copy of Balaam Gimble's at Book People in Austin on the strength of a review of the book in Texas Observer's summer books round up and was generally happy with the result. Author Mike Nichols sets his story in the fictional Texas town of Willoughby which he locates at the intersection of Highways 21 and 36. The actual town at the intersection of Highways 21 and 36 is Caldwell, seat of Burleson County and larger Willoughby which strikes me as being more like Dimebox, but what of that? Fiction is all about making things up and Nichols spins a fun and funny yarn of the unintended consequences of an accidental discovery and the yearning for a nowhere town to become a somewhere town. The characters are drawn broadly, but the characterizations are not condescending. And I'm certain that if anyone read this book out loud on the steps of the Burleson County courthouse, it would sound as if it were a performance in the native tongue."
5,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed reading this book and am sure will re-read it later on as I grow older. I admire his resolve to overcome adversaries. The book followed his distinguished professional career well, but I do long more for the personal side of his life. I want to know whethter his sexuality influenced his research and career, what the life was like growing up in a 'male' German culture, etc. I do hope there will be a more complete biography of him in he future that covers all aspects of his life."
5,Great Pre-school Storytime Book,"""Is your Mama a llama? I asked my friend Rhonda."" ""I think not, is how Rhonda responded."" Little llama wants to know if his friend's mothers are llamas too. Superb, rich illustrations of the baby animals and mamas, including such exotics as bats and swans make this a Storytime favorite. My group has this one memorized and love to read along with the illustrations. Remember they are only three! New members to the group feel comfortable giving the correct responses with the rest of the tried and true. Treat your group to the bigger than life version. Fun to turn the huge pages and the illustrations translate well."
3,"Cute and fun, better for the under 2 1/2s","It bores my son after a couple of weeks and he's not yet three. At first though, he did really like it. Cute rhymes that are easy to remember, and he loved screaming the responses at first."
2,Not as good as I thought?,"My children did not enjoy this book as much as I thought they might. The illustrations are darker, mute tones... not a lot of curb appeal. I was not too impressed with the story itself."
2,Is Your Mama a Llama?,I did not read the description thoroughly enough to note that this was not the version of this terrific book that I wanted to order. Maybe a more prominent description would benefit others.
5,Mommy-baby Rhyme,"In this children's whimsical favorite, wide-eyed baby Llama tours from daylight to sunset, asking his animal-friends the repeated question, IS YOUR MAMA A LLAMA and gets a different rhymed riddle each time for him (and the young readers) to guess the answers. The visits to the bats, swans, cows, seals, kangaroos and his own kind constitute a whole heartwarming poem where different creatures with similar twinkling smiles gather together to celebrate the mother-baby bond. Children learn the characteristics of each natural residents mentioned, hear the rhythm of crisp verses and enjoy the visually enchanting illustrations that end with little llama finally returns and cuddles up with his llama mama."
5,Best ever...,"My husband and I love this book even more then the kids, and my kids really dig it. It's not just for babies. We have all been caught many times wandering around mumbling, -""Is your mama a llama?"" I asked my friend Dave.- in a singsongy rhythm. I just wish the author and illustrator would get together again and write more books, because their work together is a beautiful marriage of art in both the visual and written mediums."
4,Llamalicious,"I read this to my youngest son, Mizak, and he loved it. The illustrations compliment the verse extremely well and Miz fell in love with the character: Lloyd the Llama - he actually told me he wanted to be a llama someday. I'm now intruiged to get a copy of this on tape, after reading the previous review, to listen to it being read with a mambo beat. I thank you and Mizak thanks you. We'd definitely recommend this to every ""llama"" we know."
5,Scotch Tape,Scotch tape is a quality tape. I use it for packaging items I sell in my store. The dispenser is quick and easy to use. I only use Scotch brand tape.
2,"Smells wonderful, but not a great cleanser",There is nothing luxurious about this shower gel. What a waste of a brand name and fragrance. Stick with the eau de parfum.
2,"Smells great, but not a great shower gel","I bought this for my fiance for the holidays. It smells great on him, but he says that it makes him feel ""slimy"" for the rest of the day. I wouldn't mind the price if the product was great, but it's a small bottle of sub-par shower gel. Next time I'll buy him the cologne instead."
4,Nice radio but WAY OVERPRICED !,"This is a very compact well made radio with an excellent tuner . It has Sync. detection tuning which is an excellent feature . I have gotten nice results with this radio , HOWEVER , there are two problems . One , it is about $100 overpriced , maybe more and two the sound quality is fair at best . OK , its compact and sleak so you can excuse the built in speaker being lousey but the phone output is also weak . This inhibits the DXing capability because you simply can't amplify the sound enough to hear the far off stations....you can tune them in (sync tuning) but you can't hear them .For this amount of money I would recommend the Sangean ATS 909 over this radio . The 909 is about $130 cheaper and has far superior qualities .To summarize,nice radio , compact , good features ...BUT!"
1,DOA,Two in a row will not work in my new Gateway 500ES desktop.Package says it is for AMD Athlon Desktop Servers with 200/266 or PC 1600/PC2100 Technology. Saleman says it doesn't matter. Maybe it does? The 500ES is 266MHz PC2100 Technology.One more trip to the store to buy a different brand DDR Memory.
3,"Loved it, but no longer supported","I've been using Smartype for nearly 8 years. I was one of the very first to purchase this product! In hindsight, I wish I would have purchased another product. However, it has saved me many, many keystrokes over the years, and I truly have become addicted to this product. I cannot see myself ever changing to another expander program, although it is inevitable at this point. Those who are considering purchase of this product should know: It is not compatible with Vista, per Stedman's web site, nor compatible with anything beyond Word 2003. As well, I had been in contact with them multiple times asking them to support Vista and future applications. Instead of resolving the issue, they have decided to no longer carry/sell the product. Not enough users. Go with Instant Text."
5,Excellent medical transcription helper,This is a great help for the medical transcriptionist person. One thing to know is that it won't mix very well with 64 bit systems which are available now. I had to buy Windows 7 upgrade to get this to work - not very easy to use now. Program is still great - the process to use it on a newer computer is not!
5,An absolute classic...,"I also am the proud owner of an original 1976 copy, and I cannot believe that it is still in one piece. This was my favorite book as a child and cannot wait to get a new copy for my two daughters!"
5,Awesome rhyming and counting book,My mom would read this book to us all the time when we were little. As the years went by we could still say the rhyming words. I am a prek teacher and decided to look it up. My class loves it just like we did day way back when! I bought several copies and gave them to my nieces and nephews hoping they will enjoy it with their families! I still love reading this book it brings back warm loving memories of my mom reading it to us. It is one of the books that has made me love to read.
4,Great book,"Great book. Very informative and gives practical ideas for addressing issues. Haven't finished it yet, but very happy so far!"
2,Not too good,"I bought this book and the Oracle Press book ""Oracle9i JDBC Programming"" which covers similar material. The ""Oracle9i JDBC Programming"" book is much better."
1,Lacking in the main area of Oracle and Java programming,"After reading this book, I felt that JDBC and SQLJ really should have been covered in depth. The problem with this book is that the core topics of EJB programming are covered in better books like the O'Reilly EJB programming book.You'd be better off buying a book that focusses in on JDBC and SQLJ programming with Oracle - that's where the real guts of Java programming with Oracle is."
1,Rebellion in the church,"Those of us who know and except the TRUTH about biblical gender roles need to speak us and let poeple know were we stand.As the prior reveiwer professes they are trying change the church.We need to stand up against this rebellion,because GOD IS ON OUR SIDE,and the bible stands behind us not them."
1,bad hollywood wannabee jpn film,"we saw this movie in tokyo. bad story, bad camera-lighting, flat composition, weak special effects, acting is so wooden as typical of japanese films, twists are bad copy of past good hollywood films, no originality etc. save your money in these hard times and catch it on tv at midnight some years down the road...it is bad idea for hollywood to remake this bad film"
4,This is *the* calendar book.,"Over the last six years or so, I have written and maintained a Hebrew Calendar program. In writing it, The ideas and published source code of Dershowitz and Reingold have always been the best references in the field of multi-calendar date manipulation. I'm glad to see that they've put their ideas into book form.The commentary is clear and often humorous, and there are good scholarly bibliographic references.A must-have for anyone interested in this area of history or programming.It is unfortunate, though, that the authors choose to restrict the use of the code and algorithms in this book. Best to use their GNU-copylefted code in Emacs if that bugs you:..."
5,Delicious,This malted milk powder made my pancakes taste awesome! Highly recommended! Here is the link to a great recipe: [...]
3,It's O.K.,"This just doesn't have that old fashion malt flavor I remember as a kid. It does have some I have tried it in smoothies,milkshakes and some baked goods."
1,Ensures you'll never enjoy a crossword puzzle,"This is perhaps the most ill-advised, poorly designed, cumbersome and irritating gadget I've ever used. Navigating the crossword grid is torture. Making out the characters on the screen gave me a headache. Discerning which squares on the grid were blank and which were filled in was stupefying. On top of that, the puzzles are uninteresting. My first attempt, at what this machine considered a ""difficult"" puzzle, took me 42 minutes to complete a puzzle that I would do in 7 or 8 minutes by hand simply because the interface is so difficult. For someone with aging vision or arthritic fingers, it would be impossible to use.I had this useless, infuriating piece of junk in the return mail less than three hours after I opened it."
1,Waste of money,This game was origianlly $99 when it came out -- they obviously lowered the price because it's awful. You cannot see the puzzle. Even in good light there is too much glare on the screen. I love the NYT crosswords but this was a shameful rendition of the classic puzzle. Forget about it.
3,"Good idea, but poorly designed","The idea of putting together an electronic version of the NY Times's best puzzles is excellent. Unfortunately, this game was not well designed. To view the clues, you have to first move the cursor to the word you want, then switch to a separate clue screen. When you are done, you have to switch back to the grid. When you go to enter answers, you have to be careful to press the right letter with the stylus.The puzzles included with this game are excellent, but they should have spent a little more time making a more user-friendly interface."
5,Very educational and fun,I got this as a get well gift about two weeks ago.I normally do not like crossword puzzels that much but this crossword puzzle machine is fun and strengthens your vocabulary immensely.I would reccomend this to a 14 or above age area or a very intelligent 13 year old (like me).If you are a parent and your kid likes crossword puzzels get them this.It can be very challenging though.Sometimes I need help from my parents to figure some out.I like how it has over 500 crossword puzzels right in the palm of your hands.
1,First try it didn't seem to do anything,I followed the instructions exactly. The product didn't seem to do anything in terms of dissolving or removing (partially or completely) my foot calluses. I would be interested to know of anyone else's experience with this product.
4,Hippocratic Writings (Penguin Classics),This book was delivered in a timely manner. The book was in excellent condition as well.
1,No,"I heard good things about this band, and that they're for the likes of nightwish n stuff. So i thought 'Oo, something for me'. Boy was i wrong. This album is soooo freakin' horrible. I couldn't even listen to the whole thing it's that bad. The only good thing i could say about this band is that the singer has a beautiful voice. It's too bad she's in such a horrible band. I can't believe i wasted my money on this edenbridge crap. I am soooooooo disapointed. Overall, an atrocious album. Pass on this"
4,very melodic,"I first bought Arcana which i liked so i decided to try this one out, and I liked it first listen. I think its the great female vocals that get me then again it could be the well writen songs or perhaps the brilliant musicianship, yes this CD has the works and would make an good buy for those into progressive music through to perhaps even doom metal. Its very melodic and yet can turn bombastic almost like Blind Guardian, it has many moods and is a melting pot of ideas. I recomend you buy this one and Arcana also they are both great. 4 and a half stars."
4,Good Magazine though Scant,Received the magazine in good condition. My piano playing son is very excited about it. It has a good variety of content. Only deficit is that it is only a few pages.
1,DID NOT WORK,"DESCRIPTION WAS A BIT MISLEADING - ASSUMED NO PROBLEM WITH USING A TOSHIBA HUB WITH MY A TOSHIBA LAPTOP.MY LAPTOP HAS 3 USB 2.0 PORTS BUT 2 CONNECTIONS ARE HARD TO USE-IN THE REAR. I WANTED TO USE THIS ITEM ON THE SIDE WHERE MY 3RD USB CONNECTION IS LOCATED.TRIED USING THIS ITEM BUT IT DID NOT WORK. TRIED TROUBLESHOOTING - NO LUCK. IT DID NOT EVEN WORK FOR USE FOR ONLY 1 USB DEVICE.I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED.I HAD AN OLDER EXPENSIVE HUB/DOCKING BAY THAT HAS SERIAL AND OTHER CONNECTIONS BUT ONLY 2 USB 2.0 CONNECTIONS. WENT BACK TO THE OLDER ONE AND IT WAS NOT EVEN A TOSHIBA BRAND LIKE MY LAPTOP.SINCE IT WAS NOT AN VERY EXPENSIVE ITEM,HELD ON TO IT AND WILL GIVE IT TO A FRIEND THAT CAN USE IT. MAYBE IT WORKS BETTER ON NON TOSIBA LAPTOPS."
4,Disturbing but necessary,"This book is disturbing, only in the sense that it reveals how humanity is a pawn in a game that must be played. History truly did not evolve spiritually, but has been fought out in the heavenlies over decades of deception. I think this book is brilliantly written, carefully divulging only what can be comprehended for the time. Let us not forget what cost there is to such a work as this. Conversion is a painful process, contribution in the process of conversion is a dying to self."
1,How Movies Confused Higgins Soul,"Mr. Higgins must wiht nine fingers, because most of the time he has his pointer aimed at American cutlutre, and its values. On the other hand, Higgins preaches about Christian living, and while he chastises people of his faith, he defends and justifies eroticism and sensuality, solely for their purpose. Attacking a culture and a way of life for sipte sake is not insightful. Hard to read."
4,"""fun"" at the movies","I've enjoyed this book, especially Gareth's writing style - sarcasm and stream of consciousness work for me. And while I haven't seen and probably won't see *all* of the movies listed, of the ones we have in common Higgins has been pretty reflective and has built upon my own take. There is so much truth in art in general and in movies in particular. We love good stories, and we're more and more open to imagery - movies are our parablee; directors are our storytellers."
2,Not what I hoped,"I am leading a Christian study group using popular films. I was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some Scriptural truth. Unfortunately, the author was much less interested in a Christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the ""church."" I know that churches have problems and hurt people, but it is not as common as this author seems to assert.He seems very angry at the church (and for some reason, all of western culture - especially America.) Living in N. Ireland could make one suspicious of religion I assume, but despite his claims to be a Chrisitan so concerned about commmunity, he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up.It is a good study of film (not movies - he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person) but not very useful in the context of the church.That's my take anyway. God bless."
3,bright at my window.,"I bought several different ones for Christmas. Pretty cheaply made,but shows well in the window. I would buy more if needed."
4,no title,"Egrossing novel, especially in the last pages, but I cannot help feeling that it is somewhat of a cheap shot to use a famous classic upon which to build your story. So much of the suspense was already written by Robert Louis Stevenson, that Martin has less to imagine than most authors. Really should have read Jekyll and Hyde first. Martin was obviously a fan of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"". Probably where she got the idea. Slow moving, but because the reader always knows much more than the novel states, because of the earlier classic, it works. Lots of tidbits about Victorian life and housekeeping. Did Mary's father abuse her sexually? Of course, we think of that in these days, even though Martin really give us no reason to. Well written and plotted."
3,An Interesting Book if You Have Nothing Else,"This book is not horrible, but it is very slow moving. I loved the rich description of Mary's everyday activities; they brought an historical reality to the work which is often missing in period pieces. But her accented speaking and (purposely) poorly written entries (to give Mary's writing historical authenticity) become tiresome. The plot is heavily based around events from the original Jeckyll and Hyde tale; it is very much a piece of fan fiction, so to speak, and in some respects Mary is - literally - a ""Mary Sue"", or a character inserted into a created world as a placeholder for the author. Also, I was annoyed that Mary's story ended with that of her master, and that no clues were left as to how her future proceeded. Read it if you have time."
2,Oy vey!,I had to read this book for school and boy what a drag it was! This book is so focused on symbolism that it made me want to puke! If your like good literature stick to the classics.
1,"Mary Hartman! Mary Hart...uh, oh - Mary Reilly! Mary Reilly!","I have been trying to learn about the system of using servants in 19th & 20th c. England, and somewhere I read that this book gave a good picture of what it was like. Alas, I should have just gotten it from the library.The idea behind this story is a good one, but unfortunately what we got amounts to a dressed-up soap opera, sloppily written, pointless and uninvolving. I found myself counting the pages to the end, and I learned absolutely nothing new or useful about how servants worked. It's rare that I buy a book I decide not to keep, but this is one."
2,what the?,"What did I just read? Is DB for real? I'm sure this photo book parading as a small gideon bible from an alternate universe would make for a good coffee table conversation piece, but beyond that?As a software engineer, Byrne places me in the seventh circle of hell."
1,Do not buy it !!!!!!!,"Bought it five months ago,used it maybe 20 times. This is my second DVD player. Tray will not open. Sony is ofering free parts, but they want me to pay for a labor, more than I've paid for new player. This is junk ! DO NOT BUY this dvd player. Sony products are not the same, good quality as thay used to be !!"
4,pretty good (purchased 3 weeks ago),"Works fine. I was pleased to find out that it will play in random order MP3 music files. One catch is that the remote has no number buttons. Therefore you cannot program it to control non-Sony TV's. Thus the volume button on the remote is useless since it will only control Sony TV's. The Picture Modes are also not a big deal - the picture settings on any TV will play a greater role in the appearance of color, contrast, etc. But DVD's play just fine, and the menus can be navigated with the arrow keys on the remote. Also, this player is very light and smallish, making it effortless to unplug and transfer to a TV in another room."
1,REceived the wrong Item and Sent it back for a credit.,"I recieved this wrong item and sent it back for a credit and you charged me for it. I would like an immediate responce. I have been trying to locate an area to send an e-mail and with no success I got this. I ordered 2 of these and I recieved one porperly. I also have a letter stating that you could not send this to be and I would receive a credit. Please credit my Mastercard for this. I am very frustrated. Thank you, Barbara Goglia"
1,What a joke!,"Yes God gives us the gift to be saved but we can lose our salvation! It's like someone gives you a gift and you accept it, but its up to you how to take care of the gift. Some ruin it, some take good care of it, and some lose it only to recover it later on in their lives. People who believe in ""once saved always saved"" doctrine are living in delusion. That doctrine basically says that you are entitled to go to heaven, no matter what you do on earth! What a spoiled attitude! People who actually read their bibles (KJV) find the truth! Apostle Paul said ""work at your salvation with fear and trembling""."

1,Not Applical to CFS,"Unfortunately Chalder has repeatedly blurred the lines between chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic fatigue. In the process, she has essentially reduced her perception of CFS to mere chronic fatigue, and tries to apply the same treatment to both, completely ignoring the many physical, not cognitive or behaviour, dysfunctions that underly CFS."
1,Dangerous,"Dangerously conflates the devastating neuro-immune disease ME (""CFS"") with Idiopathic Chronic Fatigue (the symptom of fatigue with no known medical cause). The resulting prescription of graded exercise is extremely dangerous for people with ME. Buy this book if you want your disease to become worse."
5,One of the Best I have ever read,"One of the ""BEST"" books I have ever read. Barrett knew his subject well and made it work so believably. You felt this man's pain as the book went along. It is one you won't put down."
1,Wrong desription,"Be aware this shower rod is BONE not BROWN, which it states a couple of times throughout the description!!! And yes, the photo is not brown but I figured it may have been a generic product photo. I was only looking for an inner shower curtain rod but didn't realize the end caps for this rod are cheap plastic! I will continue looking for a decent, inexpensive mounted shower rod, because this wasn't it!"
1,Never recieved my item,"I ordered a book from this seller a month before Christmas for a present. I never received it. This was especially upsetting because it left me with one present short of what I had planned on giving. I tried to contact them several times, but they never responded."
3,"Great Tool, Can't Grow the Set","This is an awesome tool. I use it all the time for a huge variety of drilling and driving tasks. It's my go-to tool for the honey-do list, electrical work, general woodworking screw driving, whatever. For that, I give it a five....But - what was Bosch thinking when they abandoned the 10.8 volt batteries for 12 volts? I'm sold on these small Li-Ion battery tools because they have decent power with reasonable battery life and they're easy to carry around. I want more. But I won't buy more Bosch because they've gone out of their way to obsolete my 10.8 volt batteries. I just bought a 12 volt Milwaukee Hackzall and it's awesome. One-handed sawzall! I did all the conduit for my basement on one charge. When the time comes to get the impact driver, it'll be Milwaukee, not Bosch, because all of Milwaukee's small Li-Ion tools are 12 volt!"
5,Little package with big power.,It actually will twist your wrist! I was shocked this tiny drill had so much torque and power. Good drill for the price however don't expect power like a hammer drill.
4,Great tool but --- can't use regular drill bits....,"This tool is everything it promises to be, BUT SILLY ME, I didn't realize that it didn't have a chuck that would allow the use of normal drill bits for drilling holes. You have to buy special drill bits that will fit the driver head you see in the picture, and they're not cheap. When you already have lots of drill bits of many sizes hanging around, it's absurd buying more just for this tool.That makes this tool much less useful than it should be. However, it was just so nice that I couldn't return it! I wanted to own it. Nevertheless, I am disappointed they don't provide an adapter chuck, like my old Black & Decker cordless has..."
2,"""Professional"" Description is an Overstatement","I purchased this compact 10.8 Lithium-Ion drill/driver with the expectations that it would match the power of the 7.2V NiCad DeWalt screwdriver with equally rated torque specs. My expectations were deflated when I couldn't even drive a 1/2"" wood screw into a piloted hole in maple. The Bosch pocket driver has so many excellent qualities: perfect size, fit, weight, build quality, balance, and a convenient quick change chuck. I was willing to pay the extra $30 over the DeWalt screwdriver despite the soft case, but I couldn't justify keeping it just to hang curtain rods or other light duty tasks. It's professionally built but I'm hard pressed to think of any professional applications that a serious DIY'er might attempt with its power limitations."
3,Tool case?,"Why can't I get a real case with a tool anymore?? I'd give it 5 stars if it came with a worth while case, 4 stars if I were able to actually buy on optional worthwhile case. What are they going to downgrade to next, a paper bag?"
1,not a real driver,"i've had this drill for about 8 months. i tried to use it as much as i could but the driver can't drive 2""screws in to pine with out stopping even with a freshly charged battery. the description says it can drive 100 3"" screws but it cant even do one. this isn't for anyone who works for a living, it might be good for a house wife to hang curtains."
4,Incompatable with Recommended Accessory,"The Bosch PS20-2 driver is a great tool for use around the shop. It performs as expected but beware of Amazon's promotions for Bosch Clic-Change driver bit sets. Amazon advertises these as accessories to the PS20-2 driver. The Clic-Change, by itself, is better than any other quick-change chuck that I have tried, but beware: some of the Clic-Change models have a 1/2-in diameter shank which is not compatable with the PS20-2's 1/4-inch chuck."
4,Packs a punch,"This thing has good power in a small package. It's nice and light, and it fits into small spaces. My only negative, which is a small gripe, is that the bit removal seems to be counter-intuitive compared with similar tools I've used. Instead of pulling the release towards the trigger, you pull away from it. Maybe I'm just used to my old DeWalt. Still an excellent product though. I'd buy it again."
5,Don't think to much about it..,"A lot of reviews here, all good. Just buy one you will not be disappointed. The biggest asset of this product is, the ability to get into tight spaces and do so with one hand as a result of the balance of the driver and for this little guy...the power is awesome.....you will NOT be disappointed..."
4,IT NEEDS MORE RPM,"IT'S A GOOD SCREWDRIVER, BUT 600 RPM INSTEAD OF 400 IS NECCESARY FOR DRILLING.....ALL OTHER IS OK.....GOOD BATTERY LASTING.....POWERFULL...LIGHT.....QUICK CHANGE BITS....IT'S A WONDERFULL TOOL"
4,handy tool for simple jobs aroubd the house,"nice little tool around the house to use and won't take up much room in your tool closet or what have you. the only gripe is you have to buy some sort of an extension to get to some screws not so easily accessible . basically if the screw is wide open you got the perfect little tool but if the screw is a about 3 or so inches deep next to something this tool won't be able to reach that screw,the rotating head gets in the way. hope you guys get my point. need that extension i mentioned earlier, hence 4 stars"
5,Bosch PS20 Pocket Driver,"Great light-weight driver with plenty of torque for its size. I purchased a Hitachi 3/8"" Key-Chuck with 1/4"" square drive to make it really versitile. Attached a 2"" dia dirt auger in the chuck to make 10"" deep holes in clay soil for fertilizing my trees. This was more torque than the tool would deliver if it was fed to quickly into the ground but, even though I stalled it several times, it completed more than 30 holes on one charge. Slipped in the second battery and completed the job."
5,Absolutely professional grade,"I purchased this driver when it first hit the market. I loved it from the start. It had long run-time and plenty of power. I use it all day, every day on all types of screws and to drill the occasional hole. I am an appliance servicer and at the end of the day this tool is a hand-saver. I will say that I had to replace my first one because I got it wet too many times and it gave out on me. Its not a big deal because when you use tools professionaly you do have to replace them because of wear and tear and sometimes just plain misuse. The upside is that I now have 4 batteries total, I can go weeks at a time without having to charge. I recommend this tool to everyone."
5,Perfect Screwdriver,"Received the Pocket Driver as a Christmas gift this year. I was looking for a compact unit with enough power to do real work, and this tool fits my needs perfectly. Fits in the hand well, very comfortable to use for a long time, plenty of power for driving screws and light-duty drilling. I just finished hanging some pegboard in my basement. I had to use my 20V cordless drill to drill the holes, but the Pocket Driver drove the 2"" screws just fine. The size and weight offer great control and balance. The quick recharge is great. Impossible to run out of power. I will definitely purchase more Bosch tools in the future!"
2,Ok Drill HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"The driver is great when it works, however when it needs repairs (about 2 months) Bosch is NO help what so ever, save your money and get something good i.e. the Milwaukee or Ridgid driver."
4,Excellent built quality.,"This unit has excellent bult quality. Feels real solid. The torque clutch works great and the lithium battery is awsome and it lasts quite a bit. Since the packs get charged in half a hour, it really doesn't matter how long the charge lasts because you get two packs. So unless you use the drill so much that you ran out of charge in less than half an hour, you pretty much can have unlimited juice... real nifty.Only drawback is that it should include a keyless chuck, so you can use it with regular drills. Aside from that is should get five stars."
3,Problems with trigger,"I have several of these drills in my cabinet shop. At first I thought they were great, but after a few months the triggers on all of them started giving me problems. I would not recommend buying these. I am thinking of trying the Milwaukee."
5,Awesome product,This driver is everything it says and then some. the battery last a very long time. I use it every day and the charge lasts 3-4 days. I would definitely buy another.
5,"LB, WI",I bought this for the size and power. Works great. Shipped on time. Thank you for great service.
2,Under-performer,"I like most Bosch tool. I own a construction & remodeling company. We use a variety of cordless tools and have several Bosch tools. I am usually impressed with Bosch quality and performance.In the case of this Pocket Driver, I am not as impressed. I find the batteries don't last as long as I had read they do. The worst part of the design (although admttedly I like the size and feel in my hand), is the poor design of the light. The LED light is a great idea, but when using it to install cabinets or use in tight-quarters where it is often dark, the light doesn't shine where the bit end is. I have tried it with 3 different sized (length) bits and none of them are well lit. If anything the light ""blinds"" you since it shines just off to the side of where the bit is.Too, bad. It was a good concept. I think I will be pruchasing a new Lithium 12 volt Milwuakee (about the same size). Hope my experience with it is better that this one."
5,does what they say it does,"just the thing for an old geezer like me. light weight, easy to handle due to the size and has plenty of power.buy one, if only to show off to your friends."
3,lite weight drill,"Like the drill however advertising states drill 300 3 "" screws with one charge......I have 2 batteries and I have never come close to the advertised statement..Drill is light weight and easy to use but not as powerful nor does the batteries last as long as my ridgid 9.6 drill driver."
5,Bosch PS20-2,I have tons of DeWalt and other professional tools. This is one to add. It is very light weight but has a lot of torque and gets the job done. The fact that you do not have to keep it on charge is a big plus to me. The carrying case is great. I wish they had left enough room for drill bits and scredriver bits in the case... I highly recommend this handy tool.
4,Bosch 10.8 Volt Pocket Driver,"I love this drill/driver. Even my wife was impressed. It has great power, and the batteries last well. Also, I found the built-in light helpful when working inside a cabinet. My only gripe is when using it in its drill mode. Using the larger size bits works okay, but the first time I used one of the small bits, it broke off in the wood. You can't put a new bit into the hex bit holder which is solidly attached to the bit."
2,Works 'ok' at normal temperture,"I've owned this driver for 2 months now and am very disappointed with it's overall performance. It works 'ok' at best. I'm a locksmith and have used several drivers over the years. At only 80lbs of torque it replaces a manual screwdriver at best. In the cold weather, (forget about it), the lithium-ion battery completely shuts down until you warm it up in your pocket. Overall it looks and feels great but should you buy a tool because it looks cool or because it can perform the jobs you ask (and i'm not asking much of it either)."
4,Better than average,"This book was obviously written by instructors. It takes you by the hand and leads you step-by-step through the design and construction of dozens and dozens of bargello pieces. It discusses repeats, compensation, resizing patterns, designing problems, etc. I understand that it's hard to find and may be expensive through the second-hand dealers. But you must have a birthday, anniversary, or something coming up soon. Don't you?"
5,Great study course for those who want to learn Russian!,I study Russian and my teacher found this book to help us learn the language. This book has great dialogues and exercises for studying Russian. This book also can come with a tape that has the dialogues. The tape is very helpful because it lets me hear how Russians speak.
2,Not as advertised,The clamps are good quality for the most part.They tend to losen up after a few hours of clamping pressure.The main clamping screw backs out on its own.
4,Excellent Source of Information Regarding what works for ELLS,"This is an excellent review of relevant research on the impact of English language reading acquisition in English language learners. This population is growing in America's public schools. If they are to become successful in the American educational system, teaching them to read and write in English is essential. This book is an important tool for teachers and other educators."
5,A must read for all business units!,"Rich's book has simplified the complex, all too often overwhelming topic of the IT infrastructure and broken it down into a non-technical, common sense format. For those immersed in their highly technical, specialized computer focus, he has brought together the IT Big Picture - A must read for all business units and IT departments. Mark A. Morales, Manager of Telecommunications, Option One Mortgage Corporation"
2,BS,"You've got to wonder if these people have ever worked in the IT industry before. Some of it makes a lot of sense, the rest seems to be made up. Maybe it all was, but they got some of it right."
1,Shabby print work,"This book has faded text through a 1/4 of the first pages, and the rest of the book looks xeroxed copied! I think the printer and publishers should reimburse thse who bought this book!"
2,THIS BOOK IS NOT PRACTICAL BOOK,"I start to read this book, but I'm sorry to say this book is notgood for your real life of work, it contains deffinitions ,theories , but when you think how is thatcould be done in real life , you may get lostit just one of the books that good for the unversity study notpractical life."
2,THIS BOOK IS NOT PRACTICAL BOOK,"I start to read this book , and I'm sorry to say that this bookis not that much for your real life,it is just explaining deffinitions, thoeries ,but when you tryto practice that in your real life working , you 'll stop and sayhow is that will be done , it just like some books that westudy during our university life not for the practical work,I..."
1,Very poor quality,Entire book looks as if it's been photo-copied. Some pages have text cut off where the photocopy hasn't been done properly. Do not recommend buying this book.
5,Travel With a Twist!,"I bought this guidebook on a whim and was not disappointed! ""Secret Chicago"" goes where few travel guides go. . . it's informative while highly entertaining. It's also really funny! As a new transplant to the Windy City, this book has been a great help. Weller's recommendations for restaurants are superb. I have visited several spots named in the book and they were all great. And since moving here (from Kansas City), I have seen Weller's name in the Chicago Tribune and New City often. Most guides are written by some unknowm. . . not this one! I'd love to meet this writer! He's really funny and knows Chicago like nobody's business.I highly recommend this book."
3,secret chicago,a bit of a disapointment- nothing really too secret here. relatively good descriptions but don't expect a book of any great beauty or insight. i'd save my money for another.
4,Eucharist,A very informative and helpful book. It helped me to gain a fuller understanding of church liturgy and worship procedures.
5,Achieving 130 Mbps now on my Vostro 1500,"This card was an easy upgrade in my Vostro 1500 (I found a third unused antenna wire when I removed the access pannel on the bottom)Using a Belkin DIR-655, I've gone from 54Mbps to 130MbpsSpeed tests wired vs wireless are now the same 5.8 to 6.o MegI've been reading on some forum postings that the Belkin DIR-655 can achieve 300Mbps, but not with this Intel card....something about the dual vs single channel.....anyway, I'm happy with the speed"
3,Wouldn't Work in my HP,Stupid HP would not allow me to use this card in my Laptop (DV2000T CTO). I would get a boot error. I hate HP. I am sure the card works great. I still have it hanging around if anyone wants to buy it off me. Had it for like the past 5 years!
4,I think the NIC is better than my router. Seems to work well.,Easy to install - documentation for the dell laptop online made it easy. Windows is reporting is running at 58 mbps and I am not close to the router.
2,Well it works,"I rec'd the product OK and eventually got it work, BUT...The packing was terrible; The circuit board was just in a plastic bag (not anti-static) and the circuit board was in the bottom of a box with a bunch of crumpled paper on top. Obviously the company has little reguard for proper circuit board handling procedures.Next, the product does NOT come with a driver CD, so it is useless until you locate the driver. Fortunately, I found the driver on the Dell Web site."
4,Reply to lilith@dorsai.org,"I found Laura, the protagonist, not at all a stock character. Certainly she was an ordinary everywoman, as intended, but this is exactly the type of character you almost never see in science fiction. She's not a technical uber-guru or a speed-freak street-warrior, but those stock types are hardly a benchmark for realism in characterization. As for the settings, I've lived most of my life in Texas, and could sense how comfortable Sterling was with Texan characters in the first few pages. While I've never been to the other settings, I found the story evocative, and especially felt like he was working from a substantial map of Singapore in his head from having spent a fair amount of time there."
4,"Intricacies abound in ""Islands""","The most cogent and well-realized examination of power--in all its forms--that I've read. Sterling presents a dense future. Readers can squabble about minor technical mispredictions, but the overall effect is timeless; this is a very unsettling and very prescient novel."
1,Not the worst I've read. But close.,"I finished this book mostly out of sheer bloodymindedness... It was way too long, and it DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE. It's an ongoing sermon about how technology and nonviolence will overcome the more basic aspects of humanity that have dominated civilization since the beginning of time. But the story doesn't support this assertion, which makes me wonder what the point of writing this book in the first place was."
3,I'm really surprised at this book.,"I have read most of Sterlings other works of fiction and loved all them (The Difference Engine, Heavy Weather, Global Head, Holy Fire, Good old fashioned future, Zeitgeist).This book surprised me. The title has nothing to do with the book. I had to force myself to read the whole thing and I only did that because it was hard to get (I know now why was out of print).The main character, Laura, and those that surround her are probably the most annoyingly self-righteous cast of characters I've seen. They live in the future, think they know everything, have genetic engineering, yet they still do natural child birth. The criminal element in this book is way more interesting and believable.I re-read my favorite science fiction when I either see it on my self and forget what it was about or every couple of years. Islands in the net is a laborous read that I wouldn't repeat."
3,Not Sterling's Best,"Having read and liked The Difference Engine, I wanted to try something else by Sterling (writing solo). While I didn't find the book to be as bad as some earlier reviewers, I do have to say sheer stubbornness is what got me to the end. This book, by the way, is not cyberpunk or even science fiction, it is more political thriller ficton or whatever. In spite of the title, the few oblique references to the ""Net"" in the book seem to refer generally to modern communication technology including television and the phone. I was pretty bored until the main character got out of Texas, and even though you want to care about her, there is nothing about her that really grabs you. Some of the minor characters are a lot more interesting. Some intriguing socio-political ideas are hazily touched on, but this was NOT one of those books that are hard to put down, which may help explain why it is out of print as of this writing."
3,A Scientific Approach,"While I often enjoy drinking green tea because of its taste, this book presents some its healthful benefits that are said to be scientifically based. At least I think they're scientifically based. Apparently subsequent information has been published that contradicts Dr. Mitscher's findings. The impact of the existence of polyphenols and antioxidents has not clearly been substantiated. I am not a scientist, so I am still confused on the issue, and this book only adds to my confusion. However, it does provide hope. Thus, I will continue to drink green tea because I like it. If it proves to be as healthful as this book claims, I have only gained."
1,terrordactyl review,"I bought this as a Christmas gift. The excited looks of the recipients quickly turned to disappointment, as one of the parts integral to propelling the Hot Wheels cars around the track broke after an hour of use. Also, the assembly instructions could have been better written and illustrated."
3,nice toy,My sun loved it but he was not able to make the car go all around the track.He could assemble everything because he is 7 years old I do not think that younger kids could make it.
2,Useless,"If you enjoy your kids screaming at you in complete frustration because their new toy is a dimestore POS, then by all means order this or any other hot wheel toy track. I'm baffled at the complexity of these things, particularly because they rarely work. The plastic is cheap, the instructions are confusing and you get the added joy of your kids losing their marbles because what you thought would take 15 minutes takes and hour. Don't waste your money."
1,Poor quality and frustrating,"I agree with most of the reviews here. Broken track pieces and duct tape were what resulted after just a few days of play. Operation is challenging for the adults so tears usually follow for the 3-5 year olds who can't get it to work properly with the crank system. We thought that we would save money on batteries, but the timing and clunky feel of the crank system makes having fun challenging."
2,stay away from the terrordactyl!,"Mattel started making toys in the 1940s, but they sure haven't learned much. It seems like they hire summer interns each year to invent new toys, and the result is junk, instead of new toys that get better year-by-year and build on over 60 years of experience.This set will entertain your family for perhaps 60 minutes, after you spend 90 minutes trying to get the pieces together. Judging by my kids, it doesn't inspire imaginative play or present an on-going play challenge, and thus they aren't interested in going back to it.You might want to put tape on the tracks to try to smooth out the bumps and get the cars to work.Once you assemble it, don't assume that you can take it apart and save it for a rainy day. If you try to pull the pieces apart, there's a good chance that you'll break the plastic locks that hold things together."
2,"Overpriced, does not do what it ""advertises""","I was really disappointed in this toy. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I have a 5 year old who has a hard time ""launching"" the cars so that they keep going around the track. Honestly, I have a hard time keeping the car moving around the track. The pterodactyl is suppose to move from side to side so that either car going around the track can hit it and send it soaring, but the wind up mechanism wears down very quickly. Batteries would have been better than the wind up mechanism.Save your money, there are better car sets out there. My son has hardly played with it since he got it three weeks ago."
1,Cheap and poorly designed,"My 5 yr. old son got this from his grandparents for Christmas and although he thought it was very exciting, it has not been a good toy. Some of the track pieces broke the very first time that we were putting it together. You cannot buy replacement parts and they broke in such a way that repairing them is impossible. One side still works okay, but my son only wants to watch his father make the cars go because he cannot hit the lever quickly and precisely enough to keep the car going around the track. Do not buy this toy!"
2,Unhappy wit [...],"I am very disatified with [...].. I purchased this for my grandson for XMAS in October. When he opened it on Christmas and they went to put it together, parts within the box were broken thus rendering the toy useless. When contacting Amazon about an exchange they said no way, it was purchased over 30 days ago... You just lost a customer amazon.com, and if you check my account history over the years I've purchased quite a bit of merchandise through you.."
5,Best Rower Available,"If you're considering a rowing machine - you owe it to yourself to check out the R100. I have used the Concept 2 at the gym and it was excellent, but I like this rower even better. It is VERY smooth, has numerous rower settings, and an excellent seat. Can even watch / listen to the TV when I'm using it.GET OFF THE COUCH and get this machine. Use it and live a much healthier life."
4,Love the kisses!,"This is my daughter's very favorite book. We read it every single day. She loves pointing to things she knows on the pages, loves pretending to smell the flowers, and loves it when I blow wind in her face. I love that at the end she kisses Mommy just like in the book. That alone makes it worth reading as often as she wants."
1,Welcome to the 21st Century,"Although this book is somewhat light hearted, I wasn't happy with the last two pages of the book. The author implies that Daddies are good for one last piggy back ride - and mommas are good for one last kiss - and putting to bed. My wife and I both put our children to bed. Sharing the same responsibilities. She should rewrite the last two pages. I was some what upset."
4,Looking forward to the third installment,"haven't played the game all that much. i'm hooked on COD4 so it was hard to switch over to play this one. the game play is much different. i would say the weapons are very realistic as far as breathing and trying to shoot steady, but the graphics and game play are lacking compared to COD. however i hear the third one that is coming out soon will be very competitive with todays top 1st person shooters."
5,Deriving Hope from History,"This is one of the best books of its type I have read. It does what so few non-fiction books do: places a current social dilemma in its historical context. Reading it, one realizes that making one nation out of people from all over the world is an unprecedented task at which America has been remarkably successful. These essays encourage the hope that the marvel of assimilation is not merely something that America used to do. Rather, it is a process that continues and seems likely to go on for the foreseeable future."
2,only one track on this cd not 20 tracks,I went to play this cd and only 1 track would show up and the other 19 = missing from the cd. I have used about 10 different cd players and dvd players and it only says track 1. I think this cd is messed up.
4,For Anti-Colonial History Buffs,"What's worth remembering? Especially if you want to ""postcard"" them? Some of these photos became postcards for the amusement of the colonists...aka Americans. As a collection, they provide insight into what Americans saw and valued in the Philippines and, dialectically, in the U.S. as well. Given our current experiences in our newer ""colonies"" we may not have progressed much as a humanist nation."
4,A UNIQUE VISUAL DELIGHT,"I've now watched this movie twice & it's starting to grow on me. By Guy Maddin's own standards this is definately a departure from his usual unusual expressionist style. The storyline is a bit incoherent, but the look is truly a treat for the eyes! Any fan of Guy Maddin should appreciate what he was trying to accomplish here, a remarkable vision on par with any of his other feature films."
3,Good Price for its Quality,"The CDs themselves came in fine- no scratches. It was the jewel case that looked pretty beat up; I am not sure if the seller had mentioned any damage to the case when I made the purchase...Personally, I appreciate much more Maestro Bernstein's interpretation of Adagio for Strings than Sr. Slatkin's. However, this two-CD set includes quite a bit of Barber's other compositional output that is totally worth collecting."
3,Great Title and a Great Cover hide a fairly mediocre release.,"After two very good albums,Exciter begins to fall into repetition and general boredom.The title is a classic that makes you want to raise your fist to the metal gods,and with that cover art,it's hard to resist this classic.It was for these reasons that I purchased this before the far superior,""Violence and Force"".Long Live the Loud features a few pretty good cuts,including a decent title track, a mean number called ""I am the Beast"" and the decent,""Victims of Sacrifice"".The band even goes into epic territory with the almost ten minute,""Wake Up Screaming"".Unfortunately,the sound hasn't progressed and the record feels rushed and rocks without much purpose.Hardly worth relistening to,this is only for die hards and completists,so you may want to add a star if your a fan."
4,Great Scholarship Book,This great book really helped me find the scholarships that are right for me! So many to choose from...
1,No 180 degree option,"Despite what the product description as well as online user manual from Kaz (who makes this Honeywell product) states, there is no 180 degree option for heat. Might not matter to some purchasers, but this was the main reason I had opted for this model."
2,Melted Itself Open,"I bought this heater last year and used it all winter very happily. It worked very well and kept my computer room comfy and warm.This year i brought it out to use, plugged it in for day use and on the second day it started turning off on me after about 3 min of use. I unplugged it and let it cool off since it got amazingly hot after that 3 min and i discovered the black, round casing with the holes in it that goes around the top, had melted itself open in the back.I loved this heater last year but can only give it 2 stars due to longevity."
4,Works in Leopard,"It works fine under 10.5 Leopard, but there is a trick to installing it:The main TurboCad installer works fine, but to to install the Symbols Library you have to bypass their installer app because it doesn't work in 10.5. What I ended up doing was mounting the installer from the disc and then right-clicked to reveal ""view package contents"". From there just navigate to: Contents/Installer Items/Symbols and just drag the folder over to replace to one already in the application folder.If you have any trouble be sure and check the permission settings for the TurboCad folder. It's a bit of trouble, but for ten bucks, who cares!"
1,Not worth the disc it is printed on,The disc is unreadable and would not eject from my iMAC. The customer service is no help either. Also they would not refund my money. Save your money.
1,I am unable to install the software because the disk is not readable.,I can't install the software because my computer will not read the disk. Efforts to get a replacement disk have been unsuccessful.
2,Disappointing,"This book is filled with information and statistics about domestic violence. However, the information presented is a bit overwhelming and needs some organization. I was confused just looking at the table of contents.I might pull this book off the shelf if I need to cite a court case, but I can't imagine assigning this to students. Readers interested in this topic would be better served by ""Domestic Violence: The Criminal Justice Response"" by Eve & Carl Buzawa."
5,Insert witty title here.,"I took this book out from the library because I was in the mood to read non-fiction about fantastic fiction. I hadn't actually read any Barker, except for two false starts on Sacrament. I now intend to rectify that situation, as I've gone out and fetched myself a copy of Weaveworld and intend to get to it forthwith, followed by his other books. This is the best biography I've read (although that's a limited number) and certainly a fascinating look into an author I knew very little about beforehand. I wish Mr. Winter's look at King was as recent, because then it would be high on my list of priorities as well."
4,Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Radio,A good portable and very good value. I am a tent camper and have a sailboat and use the radio outside. The talk sound quality is very good and FM music is OK. Using the radio for storing stations and frequency scanning is not intuitive but read the manual and you may become very proficient using the radios features. The only drawback is finding a AC/DC converter. I use rechargeable batteries and keep charged spares on hand.
5,Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave Radio with SSB,"This radio has additional controls on both sides of the radio to aid in tuning in frequencies. This radio is able to pick up stations that some of my other portable radios can not. It is more than just AM (MW), FM, and SW (my count is 14 bands)- it can also tune LW. This radio has a quality feel to it. There are cheaper radios out there but I chose this one based on having owned a 7600 series radio previously (used it extensively for about 15 years until the on/off switch failed, I regret not getting it repaired). On the rear of the radio is a world map with time zones. The radio also included the Sony AN-71 compact Antenna and a short wave radio station book along with the owners manual. The manual is available online and anyone interested in this radio should take a look at it."
3,Sony radio,"Nice design, reception is decent in the rooms with the window, but if you take it inside the bathroom or office then reception deteriorates.Setup is not very intuitive, so you will have to read the thick manual.Lacks AC adapter"
4,No adapter included,The unit has good reception. Drawback: No AC adapter is included as in my previous older version ICF-SW7600. The Sony adapter 6V 700mA that they recommend and which is listed in their manual can't seem to be found and only is sold in Japan which is ridiculous.
4,Sony SW7600GR Shortwave - great compact SW radio,"Just a quick review. This product is great for its size and cost. The options for fine tuning really help finding and keeping the stations. My only complaint so far is that the product did not come with the AC adapter so I had to purchase separately. Seems a bit strange to not include the AC plug.The unit feels solid and well built. The instructions/buttons are a bit complex but maybe that is the norm with SW. There was a modestly steep initial learning curve to get it to work well but I am new to SW. Otherwise, great purchase and fun to work with."
4,"Great radio, but with one shortcoming...","This is an excellent shortwave with quality reception on all bands. However, after using this radio for over a year, I found its only shortcoming to be a mechanical one...it doesn't have a carrying handle! Unless you're careful, you'll press one or more buttons every time you move it (annoying, to say the least). Yes, it does come with a pitiful case that has a thin `strap' on the top for carrying, but you'll have to remove the case completely to operate the radio. Otherwise, it's a solid and reliable shortwave for under $200."
2,no ac adapter available,"quality radio sound but no ac adapter available from Sony. Cannot find anywhere, should have been included with product purchase."
5,"Very good, nice price","I believe this radio is no longer in production but it is still possible to buy one.Reception has great sensitivity including the MW bands. Listening ham radio stations in SSB and CW is a pleasure. It is easy to fine tune the SSB signals and I like the audio.Noise has not been an issue; it seems that the integrated filters are OK, so no need to use the ATT control in the past 2 weeks.User manual is not complicated and the included external antenna does a great job."
5,Best portable SW radio with superior 'Made in Japan' quality,"First introduced to the market April 2001. 10 years on and still one of, if not the best portable SW radio available in the world today.The best feature is the overall quality, bar none. These radios are still made in Japan today unlike other inferior made in China SW radios on the market. SW performance (using the whip) I find to be very good. SSB works well and the sync' detector is an excellent feature. Design and layout is excellent though the side switches for tone and sync/SSB might be too fiddly for some. The page memory system is convienient and easy to use.Pros:Build quality, durable, good sound quality, great reception, analog volume control, lightweight, long battery lifeCons:LCD display might not be to everyones tastesI would strongly advise anyone who is considering a portable to check out the SW7600GR. For the price and size, I have not found better."
2,poor reception,"I was disappointed in the reception of this radio, I have a regular boombox type radio with a shorter antenna that picks up FM stations better. For the price it should come with an AC adapter."
3,not as good as I expected,"I bought it as a gift for my dad in China. I researched several days on internet before the purchase, and bought the best one I could find as a shortwave radio.I tried it as I traveled to China. The product is as good as I expected. (1) It is not so easy to learn how to use it. It come only with English manual without multi language user instruction. It took me several days to find oversea broadcast in China. (2) The voice quality seems to be okay and the frequencies are locked. But, afterall it is shortwave radio quality. I haven't listened shortwave radio for years, and cannot make too much judgement on that. (3) It doesn't come with power adaptor.But, if one want to buy a GOOD shorterwave radio, there are not too many options."
2,Disappointing,"I just received my Sony radio today. I am very disappointed with the product. I own two similar radios, the Sangean 909 ATS and a Grundig YB 400 PE. When I bought these radios, it included an AC adaptor. Sony appears to be too cheap to include it. Set up is not easy. It does appear to be built well. Sony had better make it easier to use when you turn it on for the first time. Setting the clock is very complicated, not easy like the Sangean or Grundig radios."
1,Reception Problem,I was unable to receive any short wave broadcasts at any time from any place inside my house or in the back yard.
2,BAD LUCK,I really wish this radio worked as I did hours of research but unfortunately I could not recieve any shortwave no matter what I tried.I even tried an outside antenna with absolutely no reception.I returned it but was really sorry to do so.I may buy another hope it's better.
2,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this radio with high hopes, and was disappointed with the performance. the pluses, solid and well built, feels substantial in your hands. The cons, difficult to tune and reception was Zilch, zero, and almost none. My RS DX-375 runs circles around it. Maybe I just got a dud. I'm gonna try another brand. Any suggestions?"
5,I like the radio very much,"I bought this radio to be used as an alarm clock, to listen at night in my bed and take it with me to other locations in house.It has a great sound, it wakes me in the morning to the morning news and I can go to sleep while listning. It has also sterio earphone plug.I don't need and don't use all the waves besides FM so I can't tell how it works. All those waves caused this radio to cost $150. But there is no ""simple"" Sony with all the features I need, So, I had to spend a little more to buy some features I don't need.After all I am satisfied."
2,FM portion died after only 3 years,"Bought this radio to use on board my boat for general FM radio reception and picking up shortwave weather broadcasts from the National Weather Service and Coast Guard. The radio had seen light use, mostly at home and more recently on the boat, but now the entire FM portion of the unit no longer works. In fact, since I've owned it I've never been able to pick up any shortwave signals at all. To be fair, I'm no shortwave guru so I maybe I'm not setting it up right. After going to Sony's repair website, they only offer repair on an exchange basis for $150... a brand new radio is about $130!Otherwise the unit was OK, not great. FM reception was good while it lasted. Bummer, I expected more from Sony."
4,"Nice, but....","Treating myself to this radio, a few years ago, it has served me pretty well. However, the critter eats batteries. If you can find one, purchase an AC adapter."
5,Great value,"I have owned this radio for about 6 months and I am very pleased, particularly considering the low price. It outperforms my old Radio Shack DX-400 and is as sensitive as my TenTec RX320D. I use a long outdoor antenna which can be switched between the Sony and the TenTec receiver. Often the SONY provides greater signal holding ability and higer signal to noise that the TenTec. The controls are somewhat confusing and it is quite easy to push the wrong button. However I generally use direct programming once I have located a station on the other radio using an Internet database. I also get great reception with the built in telescoping antenna and also with a Degen brand powered tuned antenna. Both of the latter work best when placed using the Sony in a room far removed from my computers and other equipment."
2,Sony's Weak Point,"My radio quickly developed problems in the volume control - one of the few non-digital parts - but too late to qualify for warranty repair.At this price level, Sony should increase its warranty and improve quality control.I would think twice before purchasing another."
5,Top Notch Portable Shortwave Radio,"This one replaced an older version that I had. It is everything that I want for travel and around the house: a carrying case, antenna adapter for better reception(when needed)and it's built very solidly. In Houston, when we were out of power for two weeks due to Hurricane Ike, this little gem fit the bill with great reception and sound, bringing me joy in the dark nights. I just wish that we still got the BBC World Service in North America!!"
4,AC Adaptor,I purchased an AC adaptor 6 volt 1300ma to use on a new ICF-SW7600GR and it produces noise. Does anyone use an AC adaptor which does not produce noise? Manufacturer etc... I'd appreciate the info.Thanks
4,Not a Bad Shortwave Radio!,"After setting up and getting started I was very pleased with the use and quality of reception of this radio! The only setback, is it is obvious that I will need an AM loop for AM reception, but what a minor deal!"
2,It's okay,"The radio gets GREAT reception. The reason I rated it so low is because of the scanning feature.When you try to scan to listen to ANY shortwave band, it will only scan the band and not all availible channels. Trying to guess the band number to start with is a real pain. For this reason alone, I would not buy this radio again (actualy I trying to sell it on Ebay)."
1,Very disappointing,Very disappointing after reading the reviews here. I got zero SW reception on any band even with the extended antenna. MW and FM were very poor. Either I got a defective unit or the item isn't worth the price of purchase. The item was returned.
5,Very nice radio,"Very nice radio. No complaints at all. Fantastic AM/FM reception.Gripes not worth loosing a star over are:1. Small speaker - pack these electronics in a box with a nice speaker.2. No AC adapter - It came with a nice manual and book, carry case even a shortwave antennae. I mean come on whats an AC adapter cost Sony?"
5,Excellent Radio,I have owned this radio for 6 months. I use it at work and it lasts 3-4 days on batteries. It is easy to control and has no trouble picking up anything with the built in antenna. AM reception is excellent and it picks up the shortwave stations very well.
2,Not as good as reviewed,"I bought this expecting exellent reception. When I bought this I also bought a Kato shortwave at 25% of the cost. The Kato has a rechargeable battery using a crank and also came with a power supply. The Sony had neither. The topper though is the Kato has better reception. Needless to say Kato stays, Sony goes!"
2,Horrible Reception - Obtuse Controls,"The size is right, its about the size of a paperback. I mainly listen to AM & FM band radio, and the reception on this little radio is awful. Its astounding it costs so much, is from a company with a good reputation, and yet performs so poorly. If you're addicted to all those non-AM & non-FM frequencies, okay, this radio is probably mediocre: bad reception, but inexpensive for what you get. When one considers the actual performance of the device, it really disappoints.If I were stranded on a desert island, Gilligan-style, I'd want one of these, but here in the big city there are cheaper, and better alternatives."
1,OverKill,"I purchased this radio primarily for AM and FM listening. I guess I should have just stuck with a basic radio without all of the bells-&-whistles. This was definitely OVERKILL for my needs.I have been very disappointed with the reception of this radio for simple AM & FM stations in my area. The radio fades in-and-out on all but very, very local FM stations. I cannot reach any FM stations further than about 10 miles while my other very small transistor has been much more successful in reaching those same stations at about 1/4 of the price of this unit.I have always been happy with all of my Sony products until now."
1,"no reception from Honolulu, Hawaii","This SW radio is brand new. I totally get how it works. What doesn't work is getting any reception from the middle of the Pacific pond (Honolulu) to anywhere in the continental U.S. All I wanted when I bought this radio was Seattle, San Francisco or New York stations broadcasting in AM or FM. At this point I will take any U.S. station, anywhere. After spending two hours with Sony tech support, they couldn't get it to work by connecting anywhere else in the U.S. The 7600GR will only connect to other Hawaii AM/FM stations which a mere $10 radio can do anyhow. Internationally I only get Australia and New Zealand so this radio has disappointed greatly. Sony tech support doesn't know so I am asking all of you, am I having this problem because I am in the middle of an ocean?"
3,Location?,The radio is pretty nice as far as options and other peoples reviews but I seem to be having issues. I must be in a bad area for reception because I can't get any far off (over 50 miles) AM/short wave stations and even the local AM chanels aren't very clear. The performance is comparable to my $35 clock radio. The only thing I can figure is that I'm too close to an airport and there is too much interference. I'm going to try using it in a few other locations before I give it a plus or minus on the rating.
5,Jim Dandy little radio,"I haven't used it enough yet, to speak to all it's features. Suffice it to say that it will do all the things that larger and more expensive radios of similar features will do and then some. Very handy size-wise. Good buy."
4,as advertised....,"Nice radio for size.Good battery life, and set feels ""solid"" . Shortwave reception, as opposed to what some others have said, does not seem too insensitive to weak signals. The synchronous detection circuit works well to decrease fading of signals. The frequency response of the speaker is not too bad at all, and is not ""tiring"" to listen to for long periods, as what some other reviews have noted. I am using a Radio Shack 6 VDC AC adapter, and works well with little if any hum audible, even on weaker signals. Sure, many of the controls are on the side, but in keeping the radio small enough for travel and such, to place more of these controls on the front panel would negate the portability of this radio, so even this design of the radio would not be a glaring negative. Overall, satisfied with the radio, and good customre service from Amazon, as I returned a previous Eton E-5, and still awaiting final disposition of that return."
4,Nice radio with shortcomings,"I agree with most of the other reviews that this is a nice little radio. The build quality is excellent and the performance is pretty much as advertised. I did return mine as I felt the audio quality on the shortwave bands had a ""thin"" quality which made (for me) listening unpleasant. The sync detector does help, but only marginally, and I found the ""hash"" noise while scanning irritating. The Sony is selective and sensitive, but on the shortwave bands my very inexpensive 30 year old tabletop proved more listenable for me. Curiously, I thought the audio performance on the FM band was nice considering the size of the little Sony."
3,Sony ICF-SW7600GR,"It's OK but.....I'm disappointed in the SW performance which was my reason for selecting this model. The search feature is subpar in my view. If I had it all to do over I would select a model that used the old method of sliding dial selection. The digital scan method used here is veg and does not lock on very well so the result is not many stations are picked up. The FM performance meets all requirements, it locks in and the sound using phones is surperb. Ditto the local AM selection. No problem here. It's only the SW operation that in my view is lacking,"
3,Complexed,"I had a AM/FM/Shortwave when i was a kid in the seventies. You just turned it on and ran through the stations that came in. This new Sony I'm sure would be the same way as soon as i figure out how to turn it on. I have been reading the guide that came with it and it looks to be written by radio engineer's. I'm excited to see what this thing does once i can get that far, so only 3 stars for now."
4,good radio,Good radio-bit complicated-reception is fair would recommned external antenna for better reception. Tried the one that came with it and it didn;t help much
5,I really like this radio,"I found the radio easy to use, beautiful and good. I am very happy with my purchase, the price is compatible with the quality of the radio. The reception is excellent on all bands. I recommend!"
4,Nice..However,"There are only two choices for frequency FM and AM. Shortwave is selected under the AM band button. There are numerous pre-set button: perhaps too many and the novice user is at a loss when first using them.Reception signal is OK and Speaker is OK but the technology of both is no better that what was offered ten years ago by grundig for the same money.It's a fine shortwave for the money, if you pay no more than $100-$120."
4,Great Radio!,"I've had mine now for about 18 months. It performs as a radio quite well so I won't delve into that. Other reviewers have already done a fine job of that.Mine has survived a few considerable drops and still works great. The case shows some damage. So this is a sturdy radio.My biggest pet peeve is with the darn Timer Standby feature. Something I will never need. The problem with it is that it is far too easy to turn it on by accident. And the default power-on time is 1:00 a.m. I have been woken up many times at 1:00 a.m. because of this. One can change the power-on time, but every time the batteries needs changing it reverts to 1:00 a.m."
5,Top Notch SW and Ham Band Radio,"After much research and reading of reviews, I decided to order this Sony. Not disappointed. I have been in ham / amateur radio for over 30 years. Got my license back when you had to know Morse (CW) code and something about electronics to pass the test. Had a lot of ham band receivers and radios over the years and this little Sony does a good job. I bought so I could listen to the ham bands, CW and SSB and distant AM stations. Works fine for what I purchased for, and the FM is not bad either! This is one of the last things you will find on the market, in Electronics anyway that is still Made in Japan."
2,Not for me,"This is my first negative review on Amazon. The Sony ICF-SW7600GR I purchased from Amazon is a huge disappointment. I could not believe how bad the FM reception is. Only a few stations come in clear, others have interference from nearby stations, or can only be heard if the radio and antenna are held in a specific direction. My Radio Shack clock radio, Tivoli Audio, and any car radio have better reception! Using the SW capabilities are hindered by a user interface that is clumsy and non-intuitive, as others have pointed out. The time is not displayed while the radio is on, unless ""enter"" is pressed, alarms are called ""standby"", the display is too simple and only readable from certain angles, and the many buttons on the side panel are flimsy and poorly labeled."
3,Very Good Radio - Challenging to Use,"As a Ham radio operator I am very satisfied with the quality of this radio and its capabilities. Very good reception. It only received 3 stars because it generally requires two hands to operate, operation is not intuitive, I find myself constantly going back to instruction manual, and it drains batteries quickly."
2,not so good,"I hated the way it tunes, keyboard only, It would be ok if you know all the frequencies you want to listen to but I like to ""cruise"" the airwaves . The scan function was so slow and just didn't seem to work very well.It worked fine when I knew the freq. and keyed it in but that's not what I like to to do."
5,good,"I have one set ot SONY ICF-SW7600GR receiver from last two months. The performence is very good. Both selectivity and sensitivity are good. On morning time I used to listen Vivid Bhatrati from Mumbai, India to my current location Rhode Island, USA. I am very satisfied with this product.My only disatisfaction with this product is its size and weight (191x120x32 mm 624 g).I want to advise SONY that why not to built receiver having same functions in the size of SONY ICF-SW11 so that it will be easy to carry."
4,Great quality but a little complicated to use.,This radio replaced a Grundig that I left in Africa with a friend. The Sony is of far superior quality and has much better reception. The Grundig was almost a toy in comparison to the Sony. Sound quality is fantastic. Tuning granularity is great and it really holds a signal. Signal fade was a huge and frustrating issue with the Grundig. My only knock on the Sony is that it is complicated to use. Maybe it is just me but it does not seem very intutive. I recently used it on a backcountry adventure and two of us in camp spent a lot of time figuring out how to get it to work and both of us came away frustrated even though we did eventually get it to do most of what we wanted. So if you are looking for a real shortwave radio at an entry level price this is probably your best bet. But be prepared to invest some time learning how it works or it will just collect dust.
2,what happened Sony?,Despite high ratings in Passport I received two duds in a row which had to be returned. I've been buying Sony products for many years and it's pretty disappointing. Seems like Japanese manufactured goods are going the way of U.S. manufactured good. I hear Sony has decided to get out of the short wave radio business. Can't imagine why. Guess I'll buy a Kaito from China.
2,What a disapointment,"I purchased this to replace an Eton radio that I loved but is no longer made. The Eton could recharge batteries, the Sony does not. The Eton's clock showed in the display window while the radio played, Sony's does not. Eton had the decency to include an AC adpapter, Sony did not. All I can say for the Sony is that it seems to have reception equal to Eton. But for a company with a long standing reputation to uphold, Sony dropped the ball on this one."
2,Totally inadequit,"I could receive no a.m stations. Only a few ham operators on short wave even after I bought an antenna. No police, fire, air , marine or foreign countries.jimohI could not recomend this radio to anyone.James I OHearn"
5,Sony ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM Shortwave World Band Receiver,"It just doesn't get any beter than this, this is it, the radio that has it all.side bandsclarifierbig displarBunch of memerieseasy on the power comsuptionThe istrucion book is thick and complicated, but I think the hole thing has numerous fitures, I mayself can tell, it's thick because it's fun.ATTJose G Clariond"
2,Don't let 'em fool you,"Purchased this battery as a replacement. I spent some time looking at the available options and found this one to be the best option - I thought. I was looking for an actual Sony replacement versus a knock-off. I was also of course looking for the best price on a Sony battery. As this is listed, it appears to be an actual Sony OEM battery but when I received it, I found the truth to be that it is just another knock-off.It works, but it is not what was adverstised by the picture and the description."
1,sony battery,"Does not hold a charge. Comparing the weight of this battery to my real Sony battery, this battery is a fraction of the weight."
3,Doubling Strategy for Advanced Players,"How to Play Tournament Backgammon is a short monograph which promises to teach backgammon players ""how to determine the proper doubling strategy ... depending on the match score.""Intermediate players will find practical guidelines on Crawford game strategies, post-Crawford free drops, mandatory doubling and ""two-away versus two-away"" games. But only advanced players with a fetish for numbers will want to moil through the book's introduction to match equity. These murky sections, which take up most of the book, are heavy on probability theory and light on useful tips.Players who learn by example will appreciate the illustrative game between the author and backgammon master Bill Robertie that is included at the end of the book."
1,"Another flawed ""Collection""","Once again, a flawed collection. Way to go guys! Whatever the ""legal"" reasons, releasing something called a ""Collection"" that doesn't include the ""Collection"" should be illegal! Boycott!"
1,again & Again!,"How many times does Mgm think where going to buy the pinkpanther collection? The just recently came out with their ultimate editionwhich did not include return of the pink panther.the other flims nobody wants or cares aboutPink Panther 2006 the big stink bomb.Now the reissue of the 2004 pink panther collection?Hmmmm.... is this, just plain double no, triple dvd dipping,it's shameful!. The pink flim collection 2009 is waste of moneythe packaging look like card board.It's sad that MGM can't release some films that are not available on dvd.If want to get into the pink panther genre.Buy the Pink Panther film collection 2004 it comes with nice packagingthat is durable.Because you cannot remaster over remaster."
3,A Fair Book,"Well, from reading a friend's copy of the book, I personally thought that this is a good book about how a few students went through Columbine and what they have done and thought since. However, for those who want to learn more about what happened andwho are researching it(like myself), I do not think that this is a suitible book since it doesn't go into the ""what"" and especially not the ""why"".All in all, despite the defecienties(which are somewhat considerable), it is a good book(especially for those who want to know about these people)."
3,Hasn't dated all that well,"Following the success of THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT!, the producers thought a feature devoted solely to great film dancing would be a smash. Unfortunately, THAT'S DANCING mixes classic scenes with some embarrasing moments--Gene Kelly praising breakdancing in a lengthy sequence, for example. On the plus side, it's wonderful to see not only Astaire and Kelly, but also Vera Zorina, Bill Robinson soloing, Eleanor Parker, etc. But where oh where are longer sequences with Bobby Van, Ray McDonald, or even co-host Liza Minelli (of course, these are primarily MGM musicals, which disqualifies a number of entries)? Every time I watch this collection, I want to put another, better one together myself!"
5,Very Enjoyable,This DVD brings a smile to your face and sets your feet to tapping. Fans of musicals & dance will love this movie. It makes a nice gift.
2,A Great Disappointment,"This is an all too typical production promising much more than it delivers. Listing Sammy Davis, Jr, Gene Kelly and Lisa Minelli on the title description is technically correct BUT they are there to praise this disappointing DVD not to perform except very briefly. What is really annoying is a several minute shot of Ray Bolger sitting in an empry theater telling us just how wonderful it was to watch Astair and Kelly perform their wonderous dual routine AND then NOT show it to us but instead cut to something completely irrelevant. Lisa Minelle is only there to tell us how great Broadway Musicals were not to actually do anything!It gets two stars insead of one only because there are some scenes that are entertaining but it is mostly a self congratulatory collection of the same superlatives repeated over and over for every scene."
2,What a pity...,"When MGM celebrated their 60th anniverasry they released this film... Unfortunately the studio included lots of footage from the output of other studios(RKO, Fox, Rank, WB - Swing Time, On Your Toes, The Red Shoes, Down Argentine Way, Flashdance etc)and the timing and editing is as clumsy as a 3 year-old loose in an editing room.There are pleasurable momements from Vera Zorina, Michael Jackson, Cyd Charisse, Ginger & Fred, Dick Powell and Busby Berkeley... Liza Minnelli MUST BE ON SOMETHING??????? The guest stars` commentary are sentimental, uninformative and down right embaressing... The footage deserved MUCH BETTER THAN THIS!!!!"
3,Last of the MGM Musical Clip Movies,"That's Dancing is the last of the entertainment series of movies that shows clips from MGM movies from the golden age of Hollywood. As such, it contains the clips that were left out of the first three movies, which means this movie is a stepdowm from the That's Entertainment series. Yet I purchased this movie and am very glad that I did."
4,Very difficult,"This book had beautiful pictures on Amazon of the feathered stars you could make. What I couldn't read was the print at the bottom of the book that indicated these were very hard blocks that took a long time to make. However, they are beautiful and the book is very nice."
3,Funny Dog Pictures with Captions,"This book, a Christmas 2008 present from my daughter Jenn, is the perfect gift from one dog owner to another. It contains 36 cute dog pictures, each with a funny caption. There is one picture / caption pair per two-page spread.It's a nice gift to open in a family setting because the pictures prompt memories of favorite dog stories. ""Remember the time Jasper stole the roast chicken off of the kitchen counter?"" Or ""That looks like Chestnut right after he bit Katie!"" Yeah, well... Better have a therapist standing by for some of those memories. All the stuff in the book is cute and nonthreatening, though.I'll report some Amazon search serendipity for this book, too. The similarly-titledIf Dogs Could Talk: Exploring the Canine Mindlooks like good reading for serious-minded dog owners. Maybe a good return gift for the person who gave me this one?"
3,Good production...But...,"The concert, the quality of the images, the sound and the extras were what all i was expected, however, i have to make a complain about the DVD, it has a bump in one of the songs ( can't remember wich was ). Thought it was a problem of my DVD player , but i tried on my PC and some other equipments and it has the same bump...so, it's a disc fail...I can't ask for a replacement because i live on South America!!"

1,DO NOT BUY,Save yourself some headaches and DO NOT PURCHASE the Creative Zen Nano Plus. It was trouble right out of the box.I consider myself to be pretty tech savy (I work in IT). And I've owned 4 other mp3 players. I also made the mistake of disregarding the other negative reviews of this product.This device would randomly turn itself off and lock up. I tried everything available on the Creative support site. Nothing fixed the problem.Do yourself a favor and save another 50 bucks and buy yourself an iPod Nano.
2,Not any better than the wireless g,I have a Belkin pre-N router and pre-N wireless cards in our desktop PCs. We have one laptop with a wireless g USB adaptor. Replaced the g with the N1 - no difference in performance. Bummer.
1,Useless for me under Windows XP,"The provided software doesn't function at all (UI elements are not manipulatable, no networks show up). Which incidentally means you can't tell it to release control so WZC can configure it; and even if you do sneaky things like kill the Belkin software and make WZC try, I get no love -- no matter what, Windows doesn't acknlowedge that there's a potential connection."
1,A real garbage,"Before a decided to buy this device i made some research amd i knew all the problems it had but, anyway, i bought it considering the good revews isntead of the bad..Now im totally dissapointed..it does interefere with your sound system no matter what drivers you install..But when sound itñs good in some moments this starts to reboot the pc and disconnect itself a lot....i wont recommend this to nobody"
2,Disappointed with N1,I upgraded to N1 for our house because it is adobe (earth brick) and have had trouble with attenuation on my previous router. N1 works no better - about 20 feet thru 2 walls knocks it out. I bought a Buffalo AirStation (WLI-TX4-G54HP) and it works much better - even though it's not N1!
3,Its an Average Book,"The book is average, but not great. While the explanations are pretty clear, the provided examples are inadequate for getting a good understanding of the topic.I would recommend this book as a refresher for those people who already know differential equations and need a refresher. However, this book moves a bit too rapidly for the beginning student."
3,A book for a writing class,I purchased this book becasue I had to. I would be very upset if I had purchased it for pleasure. Just not my type of reading.
3,Warning -- No voice function,"I can't really review this item cause I don't own it. I just wanted shoppers to know that this dictionary does NOT have a voice function even thought its name includes the word, ""speaking"". I almost purchased this item, but while I was searching for other user's reviews on different websites, I noticed on the spec that it has no voice function. (on the Amazon product details, it's not really clear) I confirmed that on their website ([...]). So, if you are looking for a real ""speaking"" dictionary, this is not your choice. This is a ""non-speaking"" dictionary."
1,"Really Strong, Disgusting Smell","I didn't pay attention to the previous reviews on this and really regret not. The lotion was nice - light and creamy with some gold glitter. A little of it went a long way. What really made me hate the product was the overbearing smell. After putting it on, I was constantly reminded of my old grandmother. It's not a very good smell and borders on being disgusting. After I put it on, I had to immediately remove it because I was getting sick/nauseous from the smell. I wouldn't recommend you buy this unless you want the old-fashioned scents to bring you close to home. It also cost a fortune for what little I did get..."
1,Pwewee,This Stank! This was not what I expected at all! It went right back. I don't think I will ever buy perfume via internet again. Not only did I not like it but the seller didn't evan pay for return shipping. That sucked too!
1,Pheromone is wonderful,The product was received quickly. I have used this product before and had trouble finding it in stores. The smell is awesome and lasts all day.I love the sparkle it leaves on my skin. Great for vacations in warm climates. Try it. Kathi
4,Nice place to learn about Kierkegaard,"This book helped me see Kierkegaard's views in a new and much more favorable light. He is often seen as a fideist, that is, someone who believes faith is irrational or nonrational. Mooney makes a strong case that this interpretation if based on misunderstandings of not only Kierkegaard's authorship, but also of what he means by ""the absurd"" and ""subjective"". I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to try and understand Fear and Trembling, and Kierkegaard, in a deeper and more accurate way."
5,The lyrics was inspirational,This music touched my heart. It awakened my desire to have God in my life.
5,"funky, chewy with just the right amount of nougat...","What feast this album is...so much more than ear candy!! This is another signature project from Bryan! The lyrics to ""Last Time"" are rich and chewy and quite filling. And of course, easily washed down with the funky, smooth as ""buttah"" arrangements. But above all, it's that Voice that is like no other!! LTIWH is poppin' fresh and a must have for all Dunk lovers!"
2,No HDMI audio decoding?! WTF?,"I dont see how a company could be going over a product and be ok releasing it with that kind of a flaw in it.. Dont get me wrong, if you have a seperate digital output, it sounds good, but i still am amazed that HK would allow their product to be released without HDMI audio decoding.. So that makes it so i cant hear some of my stuff like my pc..."
4,Perfect!,"My boots just came in the mail today and they're great! They're really well made, however, they're narrow. I wear a size 10 1/2, so if you wear a half size, go up to the next size. If your feet aren't narrow, ""normal"" width, or wide, i suggest going up ANOTHER size. I bought a size 12, so they fit perfectly, and they've got room for my toes to wiggle, they don't hurt at all. I'm 5'11"" and it's hard to find heels that don't hurt, but these are nice. They don't stand straight up on their own either, so they're real easy to get on and they crunch around your ankles and thighs which makes them look really nice. If you're not used to wearing heels, the heel on them is real thin and it may take some getting used to to walk in them. But otherwise, no complaints, they're comfortable and beautiful!!"
4,Pirate boots,"These boots are awesome looking! My daughter needed them to complete her pirate outfit for a modeling show. She's petite and has narrow feet, so shoes being too tight isn't usually something I hear; but these boots are very narrow. She got many compliments on them. They are very well made, the ribbons complete the look, and if the heel wasn't so high she'd wear them for Halloween Trick-or-Treating. Great boot, but narrow, so size up if you think you'll need to."
5,Excellent..!,"If you enjoy the Bill Gaither's songs and music, you will really enjoy this great gospel CD...! Most of them you may have already heard before from years ago...Order it today..! As they often say ""Old Is Better""."
1,Rain-X blade comments,"Despite the supplier's assertation that this blade was suitable for my vehicle, it was not. The connection method was for a typical vehicle, not a Land Rover which requires a specific system of connection to wiper arm.I was forced to fabricate a working connection and only time will tell if this will be adequate.I would not reccomend this product or manufacturer due to inaccurate claim of suitability."
1,WRONG INFORMATION,"This 14"" Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blade does not fit the rear of a 2008 VW GTI as stated in the description.The wiper arm is not a shepard's crook.This is an OEM item only!"
3,Fitment error,"These wipers are suggested to fit a 1995 Wrangler, but did not have appropriate retention method."
1,Does not fit Audi A4 as recommended by Amazon,"These wipers are offered at many local retial stores. They do not fit the Audi A4 base and quattro models. Reason being is, that while the wiper blade control arm is a 'hook' form, the way the outer part of the arm is designed, the hook space is actually much more narrow than your standard wiper blade. Basically, you need a wiper blade which has a smaller clip on space. Like much of the other blades offered at retial stores, the wider clip on space fits great on other vehicals, just not on Audi. I was thinking of purchasing the Bosch ones for mine, but now I am a little skeptical, considering I am being recommended a wiper I know for a fact does not fit my car."
1,Not good for installation,"The wipers are a pain to install espically for large minivans and large ""j"" hooks. Could not get them to work properly. things are expensive and a piece of crap."
5,EZ Install,"The equipment fit to a ""T"". Very easy to remove old one and replace with the new one. Did both under 15 minutes."
2,"Sorry Amazon, I have to disagree","Sorry Amazon, the Weatherbeater wipers are not premium anything.I gave them two stars cause I wanted to be nice.Three months after purchasing these blades and they are candidatesfor the dump already. Streaking badly.I don't have a horse in this race, but my suggestion is to spenda few more bucks and buy a better product.These blades are poor quality. Will never buy them again."
4,good product,"This wiper fits my car and clean very good but it's not exactly the standard and exceeds a little, almost reaching the break light ."
2,Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blade,"According to the selection process, it showed that this product fits my car. I have had trouble making this fit for my car. Again, with all my reviews, I research more than the average person and thus far I had to put the old wiper blades back on my car - sorry.... I hate giving bad reviews, but this is what I feel."
5,Works Great,These intstall very easily and have lasted a long time. I would buy these again. . . . . .
1,Doesn't wipe full area of blade,"My Nissan Murano uses a 26"" blade on the driver's side and an 18"" on the passenger side. The 18"" works great. But the 26"" blade sticks up at the last 4"" or 5"" of the blade due to the curve of the windshield. It hugs the windshield tight when in the fully down position, but as the blade moves it loses contact and at the far position the last 5"" of the blade is completely lifted off the windshield doing no good at all. This blade is worthless if you have a Murano. I'm trying to find another one that will press down on the glass for the entire sweep of the blade."
4,Best cheap blades out there.,"I actually bought these to replace some expensive Bosch Icons that werent worth a darn.The Rain-X Weather beaters clean the windshield perfectly with no streaks in any rainy conditions.The only problems i came across with on these blades are,they squeak a bit when they are new but the sound will go away after a while,also these blades seems to only last about 4-8 months and even after cleaning the rubber off,the blades streaked the windshield even worse,however i do recommend these to anyone.They are cheap and they work well,just dont last very long.I am gonna buy another set."
1,Doesn't Fit Grand Caravan,Bought these for a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan in the correct size but we could not get them on. We messed around in the freezing Minnesota cold for 1/2 hour or so and ended up returning them. Bought Michelin brand and had both wipers on in less than 5 mins.
1,Broke in 6 months,"Not much to say - after 6 months of use, the thin rubber strip that comes in contact with the windshield cracked off the base of the wiper and peeled off about half way up the blade.Pretty useless product if it is not going to even last one year."
5,Bought wipers online so I didn't have to crash on the way to the store from not seeing out the window.,"Using the ""My Garage"" function on Amazon, I was easily able to identify what size wipers I needed and ordered these quickly, had them delivered to my house quickly, and was able to replace them without having to leave and wreck my car on the way to the store because I couldn't see out the window. They work great, no streaking - just crisp clean."
4,Nice Wipers,Installed after my previous pair became useless.. these wipers work well and hug the windshield nicely. Clean non streak wipes.. 8 out or 10 stars..
5,LIKE,"These work great so far, only had them a couple of weeks but so much better than the last ones the dealership put on my car. Either in lots of rain or a little they keep my wind shield clear with no noise or scraping."
2,Right size but bad fit,"The blade is the correct length, but the spindle that snaps into the blade holder is a bit too small.I had to wedge a piece of thick paper to get it to snap in snugly. The next time I'll look for theSaturn replacement Part #96624648 for my '08 Vue."
5,"Great wipers, effective and quiet!","I've been using these wipers for about 2 weeks now and I'm very happy with them. They are much quieter than my old wipers and clear the rain very well. They don't contain any Rain-X (teflon) chemicals, but they pair well together. I'm a big fan of all Rain-X products I've used, including the washer fluid. Hopefully they have a good lifespan."
1,Doesn't fit Honda Element 2009,"After messing with it, even using a pair of pliers to widen the hole so the wiper arm would fit, the post didn't fit my Honda Element 2009 even though Amazon's Part Finder said it would. I ended up removing just the wiper blade (after prying it out with needle nose pliers) and sliding the new blade onto the old OEM Honda fittings. NOT HAPPY that Amazon's Part Finder is dead wrong!"
1,WRONG ADAPTER,The website said it fits my car but the Nissan Juke takes a large J-hook adapter and the blade comes with a small J-hook adapter.
2,Streaks on day 1,"I've had these blades for a few months now and the day I installed them they left streaks when I used them. Today they are just as bad. I've tried cleaning the blade, making sure there isn't a leaf or some dirt under, but they struggle. Try another brand, these aren't great."
4,Good wipers,"These wipers (21"" and 22"") work great and last as long as any others. They fit nicely on my 1997 Nissan maxima"
1,Do not work!,"I got these wiper blades for my 2007 Honda CRV. The problem is, the blades are so stiff they do not conform to the windshield, so they only touch about half of the length they are supposed to. So, I have 2 clean arcs on my windshield, and dirty area in between. Do not buy these!!!"
1,These are terrible for 2006 Acura TSX,"These are terrible for my 2006 Acura TSX. The wiper fits, but there is a large section in the middle of the windshield that this wiper misses completely. The blade assembly is not flexible enough to fit the contour of the windshield in this section. Not recommended at all for this application."
5,ty! great price!,"These are they kind of wiper blades I prefer to use on my truck and they can be hard to find near by so I like to buy them on here. Now, if your vehicle is outside 24/7 them you will need new blades every 6-9 months, depending on where you live. I'm in the middle of Florida and have to park under a huge oak tree so I have to clean off my windshield a lot. I purchased this with one for the other side of my windshield together so that when my other side needs replaced, I already have it on hand. These are worth the money and I love the price. Amazon keeps me from driving all over my county to get the best deals because the majority of the best deals are right here. I WILL BUY AGAIN!!"

Amazon keeps me from driving all over my county to get the best deals because the majority of the best deals are right here. I WILL BUY AGAIN!!"
3,Poor Packaging,"I ordered this product because they were sold out in all the local stores and I desperately needed a wiper blade. However, when I recieved the blade, the package beat up and ultimately the wiper blade was bend and not useable. I know I could have contacted Amazon and they would have taken care of it. (They are good about that stuff.) But I didn't want to wait for another one in the mail. I ended up buying one at the local WalMart. The wiper blade's performance is good. I live in the south and we don't get much rain, so I don't see the point in buying really expensive wiper blades. This one gets the job done at a reasonable price."
1,Rip off!!,"Okay, so I had previously written a positive review after having the wipers for a few days. Now after having them for a few weeks, my opinion has drastically changed! The wipers started leaving streaks, then the wipers started falling off completely. Everytime I tried to use the wipers they would come off, they're the right size. I had a mechanic friend check them out. He basically just told me that I got ripped off and when my boyfriend first looked at the wipers for me, he took the blade off and my wiper fell and cracked my windshield. haha, awesome! So, now i'm stuck with crappy wipers and a cracked windshield. I should have listened to the negative reviews!"
3,1 year?!,Worked great at first. But almost exactly one year to the day I bought them they're now almost useless. Is that a normal lifespan for wipers? I don't recall ever having to replace them that often. I'm trying a different brand next.
4,Works well so far.,"Easy install, I've been through a few car washes since getting a set of these for my '08 Suzuki SX-4 and live in a high wind area but they haven't had any wear show up yet after a month. No complaints about this product, it clearly gets the job done, especially when my windshield is treated with other Rain-X products."
5,Perfect So Far,"They installed easily (getting the old pair off was more effort) and have had no trouble so far. There haven't been any issues with warping or missing spots on the windshield. They have gone through perhaps a dozen freezings and haven't shown any problems, though it has only been a few months. Recommend."
2,Sort of worked for a while,"I'm in the Seattle area and I installed these on my 10 year old Toyota Avalon about seven weeks ago and while they worked adequately for the first few weeks I will end up replacing them this week as they now chatter horribly if you have anything less than a stead downpour, in other words; the type of drizzle Seattle has five months out of the year.I can't speak to the Rain-X properties because I treated my windows with the Rain-X product (which I quite like) a few weeks before purchasing these blades so there was no way to tell how long, or even if, the blades helped. They get two stars for actually removing water from the windshield but I won't be purchasing them again. Do yourself a favor and just use the product on your car and forget their wipers."
3,Works but a bit noisy,"When the windshield is dry, the wipers are louder than expected. The only one I've used before were made by Bosch, which were always quiet. I thought these would be similar but they're not. I will not buy these again."
3,"Great for warmer climates, not so great for snow.","Really liked these wipers at first.. until it turned cold and snowy. In the snow, these wipers tend to quickly build up lots of ice on the blades and become useless until you stop and break off all of the ice build-up. Doesn't quite live up to winter expectations."
2,"Amazon, please",I'm sure the product would be fine if it fit. Amazon states they fit with the CLk 320 and they aren't even close. I'm assuming this is the case for many German cars as they rarely use the standard J-hook.Nothing's wrong with the product to my knowledge. Just be wary if you don't have a standard J-hook wiper system.
4,Good Buy,They worked very well. They were easy to install and kept my windshield clear so i could drive. Would recommend
4,Good buy,They worked very well. They were easy to install and kept my windshield clear so i could drive. Would recommend
1,Does not fit 2010 Honda CRV,This blade does not fit a 2010 Honda CRV as advertised. The front half of the blade doesn't touch the windshield.
2,Not sure if I received a faulty one...,"I purchased this a week ago and when I installed it onto my car, there was a section that it didnt cover. So when I wet my windshield and turn on the wipers, there is a spot [approx. size of a fist] that it doesn't cover even though it goes over the spot. It just bugs the heck out of me."
4,LEGIT.,"Living in Los Angeles, the use of wiper blades is almost non-existant but about every year/ year and a half, it is necessary to change them. I can't believe that I didn't know about Rain-X before!I own a 2005 TSX and I'm really happy!Great value."
4,"Blade is great, just make sure size it right","No problems with these Rain-X blades. They do a nice job with rain and still hold up well with mud and slush. Only thing to watch out for is the sizing according to the ""My Garage"" feature. The specs on my car call for 12"" blades, but My Garage led me to 14"". The 14"" blades still work, so it isn't a big deal, but 12"" do fit a little better."
4,Not bad,"The car I purchased these for required a very small size wiper blade which I had a hard time finding in stores near me, so I decided to order from Amazon instead. The wipers worked fine, though after a few months they did start to leave the typical streaks across my windshield."
5,Rare fit for my C4 Corvette,"I bought the Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades for my 1990 Corvette. They weren't the cheapest replacements out there, but they still cost under $10 so I gave them a shot. It's hard to find aftermarket wiper blades for my Corvette because the clearance under the hood where they rest is very shallow. I had them installed in under 5 minutes. They fit and work perfectly. They clear my windows without streaks, and they are silent too. I give them 5 stars for my 1990 Corvette because they work well, fit well, and are inexpensive."
4,"Nothing special, nothing wrong. Good quality.","I've had a number of these over the years: they're pretty much what you'd normally expect of a wiper blade replacement in the 'good old days.' Good quality, seem to last more or less indefinitely, nothing fancy about em. :)"
1,I should be paid for wasting my time on these,"These were pretty awful. I bought them from Target and put them on my Camry 2009 and it was streak city. I'm going to be honest, I know nothing about cars which is why I haven't changed my windshield wipers in nearly 4 years but the 4 year wipers performed better than these. It was an absolute disappointment. Never again. Shameful product."
1,Terrible Product,"I think these are a terrible product.Within a week they were already streaking.The last straw for me was that one of the retaining clips has come loose, so every few days the wiper blade will come off of the arm and flop over. I have to wait until I stop and fix the arm.Also, the bottom half of the blade moves a lot in the wind even at low speeds. Just a cheap product. I suspect they are capitalizing on the name brand.My friend recommended the washer fluid, as that works well for him.I'll be replacing these blades with a more normal product this weekend."
1,over priced junk,"the 14"" wiper blade came apart in one winter. the 18"" 19"" blades skip & chatter. false advertising of product by rain-x"
4,Got this for my back windshield,Got this for my husband Equinox (back windshield). Does the trick perfectly. Snapped on easily. No problems at all. Will probably purchase this one again in 6 months or so when it's time to replace.
1,does not fit my 2004 Jeep,"The clip does not fit my 2004 Jeep. The wiper may be the right size but unless you want to duct tape it to your vehicle it won't do you much good. The return will cost more than the product. Just picked one up locally and it came with a different clip. FYI the shipped wiper came in a huge box with nothing, just like someone plucked it out of the sky to fill the order not paying attention to size and fit."
4,Great,"These wipers (21"" and 22"") work great and last as long as any others. They fit nicely on my 1997 Nissan maxima."
1,Ehhh..,We normally have great luck with these wipers but the last 2 sets we have purchased melted to the windshield on sunny 60 degree day. No good for warm climates
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these wiper blades because they were affordable, and I believe I bought them from a retail store in the past. Honestly, you get what you pay for. Within the week of putting them on, we had a snow storm, and these could barely keep my windshield clean. They squeaked, creaked, and made other loud noises as they steeped across my window, leaving large streaks uncleared.If you live on a sunny island with rare rain showers and no snow, I recommend these wiper blades! For the rest of us, don't be cheap like I was! Buy a better blade!"
1,Not as shown.,"Ordered for 2005 Ford Freestyle. Wiper sent does NOT include fitment pieces required to mount on that vehicle. Only ""replacement"" is shown on return screen. Why would I replace this with same item that does not fit?"
2,Don't bother,I bought these because my old ones were getting old and leaving a lot of streaks.I saw a commercial saying the Rainex blades never streak But the ended up streaking more than the old ones.In my opinion these are the WORST wiper blades I've had.Save your money...pass them by.
1,Worst wiper I've ever had,The three year old Bosch wiper was squeaking because it'd turned stiff and wouldn't flip over on the opposite stroke. I replaced it with Rain-X. The wiper streaked along its entire length after installation when I used my windshield washer. I'd hoped that in a heavy rain it would clean up and work well. WRONG! It got worse and my visibility was so poor that I felt that driving was dangerous. Luckily I didn't have far to go before I could change it. I've always liked the Rain-X liquid so felt that I could trust the brand. Maybe I got a bad one but I've never had this happen with other brands. I won't chance buying these again.
1,Dont Buy,"This blade does not fit a 2011 CR-V, the shape of the windshield and the location of the wiper it will not allow the blade to bend correctly and be able to swipe across using the top half of the blade and it blocks the water from spraying the window."
1,Bad geometry,"On my Honda CRV, this blade does not have enough curve or swivel capacity to wipe the full area across the glass. A large area in the low center region of the windshield, probably about one square foot, is not touched at all by the wiper blade.I examined the wiper and I can see that there is no chance for that portion of the blade to conform to the slightly curved shape of the glass. If the blade assembly had more of an arch, or if it could swivel a bit more at the pivot point on the wiper arm, it would probably work much better.I am going to try bending the end of the blade assembly a little to see it that helps, but I will not be buying any more Rain-X blades for this car."
5,Worth the Money,"These wiper blades are worth the money. They last a long time, and wipe the windshield clean every time. I have had no streaking issues at all in any sort of weather. If you don't want any issues with worrying about improper installation, etc then just have the employee install them. That's what I did, and it wasn't an issue at all."
1,Worst Wipers,These ar the worst wipers I have ever had - I actually miss my worn out ones. They streak and do a horrible job - I will be replaceing this weekend - total wast of $
5,Fits perfectly on my car.,"Installation was a snap, the blade works perfectly. Makes full contact along the entire window, no streaks. Looks similar to my OEM blade but works a lot better than the OEM blade. This was on my 2003 Ford Focus ZX5 hatchback."
2,didn't fit my 08 Vue,"When I ordered it, the ad said it was an exact fit for my 2008 Saturn Vue. It was not! Mounting pin was too small of a diameter. I ended up taking the blade only out of it and put it in my old frame, just to salvage it. It needs and alternate pin included for other applications.T W"
4,Amazon gave wrong fitment information,"Not the product's fault, but definitely Amazon's fault. I ordered two of these for my Jeep Wrangler and procrastinating on installing them. Of course 18"" is way too big. This vehicle takes 13"" wipers. And since my return window has expired, I'm stuck with them.So double check your fitment information because Amazon lied to me and now I'm stuck with them.Otherwise, they're great wipers, I'll continue to buy Rain-x brand. Just the right size next time."
2,wrong blade,ordered what the rain x site told me I needed for my car. It was the wrong blade and would notfit. Wasted a week waiting on it. Package I received from Amazon had been previously opened. Return took about 2 weeks to get my money back. All and all a 3 week waste of my time.
2,inconsistent quality,I bought two pair in different sizes and one pair was great but the other pair had deteriorated edges that left water in lines from the first use and one lock didn't secure the blade to the arm well. I had to buy a replacement immediately.
1,Piece of crap!,"I purchased these blades because of the reviews and books in Wal-Mart that said they were 'premium' quality. HA! What a joke.The dealer installed the flat-blade design on my Acura RDX and got chattering only after about 2 months of use. I thought it was because of the design.I then put the weatherbeater design on my Solara because of the high reviews. With Aquapel applied to the windshield, I still get chattering, and that was after 10 minutes into the first use.Streaking is unreal! I could barely see out of the windshield because of all the streaking haze. I just left the wipers off and relied on the Aquapel. Yeah, it was that bad.Do the manufactures even test their products? Looks like they would put some of the money that they spend on their fancy packaging and put towards testing and improving the quality.VERY DISAPPOINTED! SAVE YOUR MONEY, BUT SOMETHING ELSE!"
1,Defective rubber,I will not buy this brand again. Bought two sets and both fell apart after about a month of use.
1,does not fit Honda Civic 2007,"I bought weatherbeater wiper blades 22"" and 26"" for my Honda Civic Hybrid 2007 from amazon.com since amazon assured me that they fit my car. The web site indicated: ""REMOVE END COVER ON BLADE TO INSTALL, CANNOT RE-USE COVER - 9 X 3 HOOK - 4 DR"". I removed the end covers leaving only the wiper blades. It tried to install them using the Honda guidelines: I removed the old wiper blade by sliding them out from one side and tried to glide in the new wiper blades (along with their metal reinforcement blades). They simply don't fit. The base of the wheatherbeater wiper blade is far wider than the Honda's one. I could reinstalled the old original Honda wipers without any problem; they glide in easily. I could not do the same with the weatherbeater blades. I tried to glide them in using the original metal reinforcement strips first, then using the new ones, and using many different ways. They simply don't fit new Honda Civics."
1,No way these could be worse,"These blades are absolute JUNK. Wiper blades are pretty basic in their design and purpose. Rain falls onto your window, the blades take it off. Not so with these blades.Install was easy, but that isn't specific to these blades as almost every blade is an easy install.From day 1 these blades ""stutter"" as they wipe creating a trail of water and a loud screeching sound with every swipe. They basically can not do the one task they are made to do.This is not specific to one blade either. Both the driver and passenger blade does the exact same thing. So I basically keep my wipers on either intermittent or I keep them off and only turn them on once there is so much water on my windshield that I HAVE to turn them on.Real Safe.I have even tried uninstalling them and reinstalling them and they work no better.I would have given 0 stars if I could have. I am using these on a 2005 Acura TL."
1,wiper blade 22 inch Rain-x-weatherbeater,The blade was worse then the one I thru away.Reva BochnerUnsatisfiedI will never buy this product from you again
4,good wiper,"i bought rain-x weatherbeater wiper blade 22' and 19'.it works pretty well, been use now for about 1 month. i recommend this product"
2,I'll buy just the blade insert next time.,Not the right length and didn't even fit my rear wiper frame assembly like it was advertised for my vehicle. I have a 2004 Toyota 4Runner. Ended up taking only the insert and cutting it to right length. Blade cleans well but I expected plug-&-play.
1,Didn't even last a year....,"Waste of money. Bought these in April 09, by Oct/Nov 09' they started coming apart. I live in So Calif so it's not like they've gotten used a lot either."
1,"Adapter cheap, broke-not recommended","the adapter needed to fit my car's j-arm was cheaply made, broke while inserting. I do not recommend this product."
1,Did not fit a Suzuki SX4,Even though this came up as a match for my Suzuki SX4 it wasn't even a close fit. Quite disappointing!
4,Nothing special.,Regular rear wiper that hopefully it will last more than a year......also I am curious to see how it works during the winter.
5,Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades.,I'm a big fan of Rain-X products. It started with the spray for windows. When I saw that they had made wiper blades it just made sense. They go on very easy and work terrific. It just makes sense.
1,Does not fit 2009 CR-V,"Despite what they say, this blade does not fit a 2009 CR-V. Between the shape of the windshield and the hinge location on the wiper, it will not allow the blade to bend correctly and be able to swipe across using the top half of the blade. Do not waste your money if you are buying this for a 2009 CR-V"
3,Made it work,The blade would not fit my truck.. I used the filler itself and inserted it in the origional arm and to date it works fine..
1,Terrible,"Bought this product for my ford fusion 2008 .. the blades fit but ended up with streaking visibility in the rain. Awful, don't buy!"
1,"Great wiper,Crap connector","I bought these for a 95 Jeep Wrangler. They are good wipers, but the connector didn't fit my factory bayonet mounts and there are no adapters"
3,amazon fail,"not sure if it was the store selling these or Amazon that said these would fit my vehicle but they don't; not directly or easily. I knew that finding blades for my 04 Land Rover Discovery was going to be difficult but I figured I'd turn to the internet since the selection is vast. I found some here that said they fit, wrong... Being the engineer that I am I modified them extensively to make them fit. They DO NOT fit a 2004 Discovery, do not buy these unless you are willing to do the same."
1,Not so great,"Purchased these and they worked great for the first month, after that I started to notice the wipers were skipping on my windshield. When I looked closer I noticed that the rubber strip that sits on the windshield was bent and warped in places, almost like the wipers were bent backwards in places and just stayed that way. Wasted $60 on 3 wipers when they first came out."
1,1993 Jeep Wrangler YJ,"Currently rolling a 93 Jeep Wrangler. Purchased the RainX Weatherbeater, size 12, at the local PepBoys. This model year of jeep has a pin arm wiper assembly and the adapter that comes with this particular wiper blade does not fit. The fit will have to be fabricated and for something that should just snap right on, why bother. This item is easy to find and looks to be a quality product, but, until RainX provides a universal adapter, go with another brand."
5,No more streaks.,Installed these on my 2002 Impala. Very suprised at how well they are performing. I thought that the streaking and smears with the old blades were due to the windshield being old. These blades eliminated the streaks and smears.
4,Decent Wipers,Rain-X RX30218 18-Inch Weatherbeater Wiper BladeThey work very well. Passenger side don't match the window at the very bottom so only 4 stars.
1,Doesn't fit newer model Silverado.,"I was pointed towards the Rain-x weatherbeaters by my mother. She had good luck with them on her pickup so I figured i would give them a try. I check to see if they fit on my truck. Amazon checks out and says they fit. I order them for under 9 bucks. I go to put on the wipers, and the blade doesn't come with the newest model of wiper attachment for my silverado. So I wait 2 weeks for my wiper when I could have spent double and find out it doesn't fit. It's so frustrating, I'm not going to be buying anything small like this online anymore. VERY FRUSTRATING....."
1,Warning: Wiper blade can come off,"I have installed these in both sides of my Mazda 3. The passenger side (18 inches long) came off on it's own. Fortunately it was on a local street and not highway speed. I found that the clip wasn't enough to hold the wiper in place, as a result the wiper can be uninstalled even without lifting the arm!! I boughtBosch 40918 Excel Micro Edge Wiper Blade - 18""as a replacement on both of my wipers and they are impossible to come lose once the wiper arms are set, they are also priced quite competitively for a name brand.Stay away from these at all cost!!"
1,"Great blade, but not for BMW X5","Having been lulled into complacency by Amazon's assurances--which worked perfectly for both windshield wipers--the RainX wiper is not compatible with the rear window of my BMW 2000X5 (for which the blade and arm are a single riveted mechanism), which is the only reason I gave the wiper a single star. Amazon's return policies are stellar, however, so all is forgiven."
1,No better than my original wipers,"My original wipers started to wear down, causing streaks that are at best annoying and at worst a dangerous hazard. I bought these new wiper blades to fix the problem, but streaks are still there. I do not recommend this product. I will try looking at the Bosch Ion wipers instead."
1,worked only the first 2 days,first got it from kragens it was really good. wiped all the water off.but the problem was it only wiped all the water off for only 2 days after that it skips and failed to wipe all the water off. spots of water everywhere on my windshield.so dont ever get this because its just not worth it. should have just gotten basch...
1,do NOT buy from amazon. do NOT buy from seller U.S.S. Autoparts.,"do NOT buy from amazon. do NOT buy from seller U.S.S. Autoparts.this wiper did not fit my car as the page stated it would. i contacted both amazon and the seller for a refund process. both stated to contact the other and gave me the run around and then ultimately offered a ludicrous refund ""promo"" return price.do NOT buy from amazon. do NOT buy from seller U.S.S. Autoparts."
2,parts cracked (broken),parts broken but I managed to use it. Too much trouble to send it back.I'll never purchase from internet again.
3,Likely would have been fine - if it fit!,"...this product likely would have been fine, if it had fit. The Amazon.com website stated that it would fit the make & model of my car, but it didn't. My dealer informed me that it wouldn't fit (after wrestling with it for a while). Amazon.com handled the return very well, and for that I am thankful. The lesson here? Perhaps it is wise to call your dealer to double-check to see if the wiper will actually fit your car!"
1,Junk,"This windshield wiper scrapes against the glass and leaves streaks, as soon as my first use after installing it. Maybe I got unlucky, but I'd find a better brand than Rain-X"
1,Dangerous flaw!,"The blades were still good and wiping clean but there was a flaw in the pin. In the middle of a rainstorm driving to work, the passenger blade popped off and made this terrible noise. It got caught up with the driver blade and bent it. I had to buy a new passenger blade but was able to straighten out the driver blade. After this I am finished with rainx blades. It was very loud and startling and appeared to happen for no reason."
1,Worst blades I ever purchased,"I purchased these blades and they turned out only to be marginally better than the old, worn out ones I was replacing. There are streaks and entire areas they miss. The basic function of a wiper blade should be to remove all water from the area it passes over. These blades cannot do even that most basic of tasks, so I have to say they are failures (and I did verify they were the correct size and installed correctly)."
1,Dangerous product - Avoid it!,"Like another reviewer, I put these blades on my daughter's '07 Mazda 3. Like the other reviewer, the passenger side blade slipped off its mount, fouled with the drivers side blade, bent that and freaked my daughter out. Thankfully she was not driving on an interstate and could pull off to try to fix them then drive the remaining distance without using her wipers. The product has a design flaw - on inspection I could see that the pin that is supposed to latch the blade to the arm is way too small. A gentle tug is all it takes to pull the blade off the arm, and both blades were just as easy to unlatch.I am lucky my daughter is still alive. Rainex, you should be ashamed! Pull this from the market before you have a huge lawsuit on your hands!"
2,Streaking after Two Months,Worked well at first and were very easy to install. After two months of very light use (we had very little rain) the wipers are streaking very badly. I will likely replace these very soon as they are streaking worse than the wipers they replaced.
2,doesn't FIT firmly on my Nissan Juke passenger side wiper arm,"Doesn't fit firmly - it would' just hold on the wiper arm when installing.I keep using it, it doesn't fall off when adjacent to Jukes windshield.Rubber itself is better than Juke's OEM blades. So, thus gets +1 star to its 1 star review."
5,As expected,"Arrived on time, installed without any issues and worked immediately. Replaced OEM wipers on '10 Carolla. These appear slightly less substantial than the originals but perform well so far."
1,Does It Fit Your Vehicle?,This did not fit and I cannot simply remove the blade and exchange with the older blade as they are entirely different styles....
3,Great music,"Her songs are forever, you can hear her heart in them. Most of her work is used by various artist. She is a wonderful wrtter."
5,its one of the most female master piece,"Laura Nyro is one of the most biggest all time musician, songwriter and singer. She did a master piece with a particular feeling about the lonely woman with a peculiar passion about 20 years in his soul. ""Eli and... "" is a trip for the anonymous New York of the last of the sixities"
3,"Works well, but has design flaws","On the one hand: it's small, it works well.On the other hand it abuses the USB spec: 1. it requires a special ""USB data cable"" (part number GR230-A2) to work in ""wired"" mode. 2. it abuses the USB current spec: the manual says it says 1 amp, whereas the USB 1 spec is 0.1 amps until it's ""configured"" by the host.Regarding the cable, if you look on page 12 of the manual, you'll see that they put RS232 signals on the USB connector (not D+ and D- as the USB spec calls for)."
2,Where are you using it?,"I'm living in downtown chicago, and I thought it would be cool to have navigation when I walk around downtown. First of all the switch on this thing is defective... I have to turn it on then jiggle it back to get it to start. It connects fine with my blackberry pearl. But that's it. It doesn't work around tall buildings, under cloudy skies, or in some cars (especially taxies it seems). So this has been useless for me."
1,beware of battery!!,"It worked quite well for about 10 months with my Nokia E62. Then, the battery just went dead. It is a propietary battery. I tried to get a new battery from any source anywhere in the world: THERE IS NO REPLACEMENT BATTERY FOR THIS UNIT. I was told by the HOLUX support team that I had to buy a new complete unit, because batteries are not guaranteed and they do not sell spare batteries. Not the kind of service I expect!"
1,beware of battery!!,"I had been using the GPSlim 240 for almost a year and suddenly, the battery went dead. THERE IS NO WAY OF GETTING A REPLACEMENT BATTERY FOR THIS MODEL. I wrote the manufacturer and they advised me ""to buy a new one""."
5,Excellent Space Opera,This here's a classic in the making. If you're looking for an exciting space opera/military scifi adventure with a great cast and superb pacing you can't do much better than this book. Highly recommended.
5,"from cover to cover, an exciting adventure","I've read all Dietz's books from ""legion"" to ""for more than glory"" and i must say that each novel has been a non-stop page turner. The writing style isn't bogged down with too much techical explanations, just enough to give the reader a basic idea of how things works. Fast paced action scenarios are easy flowing and don't give a forced or rushed feeling. Dietz is able to encompass both sides of action so the reader can easily understand what's going on without losing the intesity of the situation. i've highly recommended reading his books to everyone i know and do so to whomever i meet."
4,A roller coaster ride of sex gun's and cyborgs,"The human empire spans the galaxy and is fueled bygreed and the lust for power. Until a force of beings decides that it is time to attack the over extended and undermaned human empire. Now trust head long into this galatic stuggel a force of funded by worried business men led by bold leaders, and manned by seemingly unstoppable cyborgs goins the frey.This force is fighting a two front war. The empire fearing colapse attacks these brave rebels and the aliens bent on total domination trust what seems to be an unstoppable blow. But through it all the love of a man and a woman(of diffrent races) survives"
4,"Intriguing at first, but falling a little short later","This was the first book I had ever read by Dietz and found it worth the trouble. I was captivated by the concept of a cyborg army with brains, something you don't see too much of on the silver screen. The intimate scenes in the book, especially the one with Mosby and the emperor/emperor were interesting to say the least. The character development in the book was well done and there were a few suprise deaths in the book, which I like. However, for some reason late in the book I became a little bored. To me it became a little too predictable but was still a good read. I am currently reading the next book in the series."
3,"A good read, but no Hammer's Slammers...","Plenty of action, but it lacks the detailed account of armed combat. It also gets a little weird towards the end, what with alien-love and all... I'll take 200 ton iridium hover tanks punching holes in enemy armor any day..."
2,An fine introduction to Covenant in the Bible,"""This is a very readable book treating the theme of covenant/covenant faithfulness in the Old and New Testaments. Hahn's presentation of the topic is clearly written and engaging. A strength of this book however, might also be its greatest weakness as Hahn's reading of the text is overpowered by marital imagery. Hahn's strong convictions regarding the marriage covenant at times seems to truncate his perspective on covenant as if marital imagery is the only adequate imagery to use when dealing with the versatile theme of covenant.""The above review was originally offered by me 10 years ago. Since then, I have grown to appreciate this book more and more. It is a valuable resource for introducing (especially) young people to the idea of covenant. And, although the criticism I offered ten years ago still has some merit, the work over-all is to be highly recommended.Five stars!"
5,Brilliant,This book reveals the history of salvation in the Bible. Without a doubt the most interesting Bible study book I have ever read. All Christians should read this book.
4,Interesting overview,"Hahn provides an interesting and entertaining overview of the Bible in this book with the general theme of a father keeping his promises (the covenants of the old and new testaments). It's a great book club book as it brings up many important ideas that are sometimes controversial. At times, the stories seem like a soap opera, but Hahn brings it back to the theme and gives some good perspective throughout. The one beef is that he doesn't answer some really big questions he asks. For instance, when God asks Abraham to kill his only son, Hahn asks, how is he supposed to know that it's GOd and not his immagination? Hahn doesn't answer that question though. I think that answer would be more important than the all of the summary of the rest of the old testament."
5,A must read for all people,"The Holy Spirit truely speaks through His servant. Scott offers us a look at the love of God through history that never before in modern times has been printed,. I would suggest you to read this book and buy a copy to give to a friend. Our Catholic faith is brought to life and set apart from current attacks against it."
4,Great book!,"I found this book to provide profound insight into several key passges in the Bible. I chose the audio version and was able to follow easily along while driving, though a more studious reader may want to instead have a Bible handy and reference where Dr Hahn quotes."
5,A covenantal stroll through (salvation) history,"Dr. Hahn has always been my favorite theologian. He writes in a way that I can ""get"" the first time though. This particular volume is an arrow-straight shot through the first six covenants of salvation history. Despite the fact that I have been reading loads of books on this topic, this easy-to-read book STILL has new insights to give me! My favorite is the correlation between the animals that the Egyptians (and many Israelites) worshipped during the Israelites' 400-year stay there and the animals both destroyed by plagues and subsequently ritually sacrificed on Israelite altars. God tries hard to sever the worhsip link between those gods (represented by the animals) and His people. Now all those years of animal sacrifices make sense AND why it was no longer necessary in the new Covenant in Jesus' time. It was a particular discipline for a particular time. Neat!I recommend this book highly!"
2,disappointing,Received the item w/o a box. How can you give a gift w/o the original box? This is inappropriate and the item looks like it could be a used one w/o the box. Not acceptable. When you purchase in a store all china comes in a box.
5,good Christian music,This group is always enjoyable-the product arrived quickly and in pristine shape. I am very happy with this purchase.
1,Steer clear of this one,"This is a far cry from Steady On and their first 2 albums, which were great pop releases. This is the worst POG album since Life, Love & Other Mysteries! Here, ""Begin With Me"" (and 1 other song I cant remember) are the only tracks on this album that are anywhere near good. This album is filled with boring, lame-o, weak-melody junk. And what's to be expected with Nathan Nockles (from Watermark) producing 3 tracks. What are the girls thinking?! They used to be very choosy in picking the songs they record. I don't know what all these reviewers giving this record a 5-star rating are thinking either. Do yourself a favor, and pick up Steady On and their first 2 albums, and steer clear of this sleeper."
2,Point of Grace: Free to Fly,"How long will self-respecting ""experts"" on Christian music continue to roll over and play dead for this sugarplum, matronly quartet? There's only so much more that can be done with this formula--these ladies ostensibly did all their stretching during childbirth, and don't recognize the blatant need for more of it artistically. Granted, you can't beat their harmonies with a stick, but there's so much left to say about the Novocaine factor contributed by the aforementioned harmonies, and the fact that each song on the new record comes off like a cheap planter in a marble lobby, looking--or in this case sounding--good with the rest of the functional decor, but really contributing nothing in terms of taste or intelligence. Ladies, you look and sound nice and you'll probably sell a million records--but it's no excuse for success to become a crutch. No matter how many suburban moms are blasting ""La La La"" in the Dodge Durango on the way to the soccer field."
5,"Awesome,Inspirational",I loved it!this was the first christian music cd I have ever bought and I love POG they have wonderful harmony! I love the way they incorporated christ into their music!
4,"Fun, but light","Misled by the marketing, I was hoping to find this a volume of accessible critical analysis of Jane Austen's influence on modern fiction. Boy, was I wrong.Only two of the essays were really thought-provoking: Lauren Baratz-Logsted's essay on Austen's heirs in chick-lit and Karen Joy Fowler's discussion of Austen's modern audience. However, I also enjoyed Jo Beverly's interesting exploration of women's economic prospects in Austen's period, which brought Elizabeth Bennet's budget into modern terms.Lawrence Watt-Evans' essay on war in Austen (or the absence of war in Austen) was very thorough if somewhat out-of-place.Aside from these stand-outs, the other essays are, for the most part, musings on Austen's relevance to the authors' personal lives -- light, amusing fare. Some of them are rewritings or sequels of part of Austen's own work, and I can't evaluate these: I found them tiresome, but perhaps that's just because they weren't what I wanted from the book."
4,Chatting over coffee with the girls,"Reading this book of essays is much like sitting down to discuss Pride and Prejudice with a group of friends over coffee. Not every essay is a winner. Some cause laughing out loud (what if the characters in the book had been equipped with cell phones, indeed). A few sound like English class assignments written the night before a deadline. There is something worthwhile in all of them, though. This is a good book to take traveling since the reader can pick it up, read a brief essay or two, and come back to it later. One reason P & P remains a top seller is that each generation sees the book with a fresh perspective--as displayed nicely in Flirting with Pride and Prejudice."
3,Not a good individual portion peanut dispenser,"I purchased this dispenser to dispense free peanuts to my customers at my hardware store. Like the larger Zervo units, it dispenses way too many peanuts to be a small hand full. The peanuts end up all over the floor. I am going to try to find a replacement paddle wheel with twice the number of paddles so the portion is cut in half."
1,too small,"It says 13 ounces, but its not dry weight. only half the box of cereal fits in the container. so only half the box gets stale."
4,It was a very good book for fans of the canadian episodes!,The book was very good...but I would have wished they could have had more on the MTV shows. I found the partes on his childhood very interestcing though. Also it didn't mention his testicluar cancer which was one of the most inportant events in his life...guess they didn't get it dont in time. But a great book for any Tom Green fan!
5,Superb Romantic Comedy in a beautiful Greek Island,"I saw this movie at the Wash DC International Film Festival in 2005/6. Since then, I have been yearning to see the movie again on DVD. For the first time, I took a proactive approach: I contacted the Toronto Film Festival where it was first released, the production studio in the U.K., and even the video stores in Athens (they had never heard of this movie). Needless to say that the movie touched me, and I was delighted that one day it showed up on Amazon Video on Demand, and to be released soon on DVD.The movie is a romantic comedy in the beautiful island of Patmos in Greece. The script is simple, but succeeds in depicting the conflict of interest between personal emotions and career ambition. It also raises the philosophical question of whether industrialization can adversely affect the quality of life. Enjoy with your significant other on big screen if you can!"
4,"Sweet love story,","Ive been to Greece, in the past and LOVED IT! This movie just brough back wonderful times! It was fun! I think ,If you want a love story with a Great view of the islands, and the Greek spirt get it!"
3,This is different.,"I have watched this twice and enjoy it. I first saw the male lead in another film, WIND. That is why I bought this one. He has a better roll in WIND. If you speak Greek, you will find this even better than three stars."
3,1996 material,"i was a bit desapointed when i received this dvd because i thought it was a brand new thing coming out but it so old .I already bought the praise and worship songs of richard smallwood and everything present in this dvd you can find it there plus some others .Still if you love praise and worship, its a must have"
5,Very Highly Recommended - Biggest Visual Impact,"I appreciate Joel Peter Witkin's photos for a few years, before I can actually own this book finally. This book makes my experience complete.A comprehensive collection of Joel-Peter Witkin's work, which belongs to the dark side of human. The careful composition of human body, objects and background, sometimes with cross-reference to classical paintings, invites a surreal, poetic, and miserable feeling.If you only think that his photos are terrible, you need more time and more patience to read his images, through understanding. Extract from what Witkin said - 'When people see my work, there is no 'grey area' of response. What they experience is either love or hate.'For all photography books I have ever read, this one is the most visual impacting ! Joel Peter Witkin's work is inspiring, original, and creative.Very highly recommended, if you want to look into our human side."
4,Good,Talk a lot about instrument. I think it's very helpful for those who want to know how telescope work. But little about data processing.
1,Not one of the better Textbooks I've read,"I'm afraid I can't give this book a very good review. The title should be ""Mathematical Analyst of Telescope Aberrations."" Even then, unless you are in the process of designing either a Cassegrain Telescope or a Schmidt Camera, the book does little except tell you what papers to consult. For my current project of building a lens based camera for my university's telescope, I found maybe 30 pages out of the entire book which were relevent. And John David Jackson's ""Classical Electrodynamics did a better job of explaining most of those topics."
2,Decent but not great,"The velcro straps don't hold for very long, other than that they're great.People who bought this product also bought:Duct Tape"
2,Velcro tears off,"The diapers themselves are great. But we have to staple the tabs otherwise they will tear off. But even with stapling, sometimes the tabs still tear off."
1,Too Small!!!,"I purchased this product for my toy yorkie. The diaper was too small and since I opened it, I can't return them. Waste of money!"
1,New design leaks terribly,"This is yet another example of a very good product cheapening itself to make a few more dollars. The old version was perfect. When the new design came and I saw the changes, I had my worries. Unfortunately they were soon borne out. Previously the diapers never leaked when worn overnight. Now I wake up every morning to urine on the floor and the diaper still on my dog. I got so tired of it that I switched brands and threw out the rest of the package."
2,The tabs break frequently,"The diapers work on the rare times they actually stay on. Usually though, the tabs break and can't be resecured. The velcro part stays on, its the other end of the tab that is supposed to be permanently attached that rips off. If you put them on loosely enough so that the tabs dont pull off, then they just slip off when the dog walks around. This is the medium size on a 20 pound dog that is 17 years old, so she is not running around in them. They work (sort of) if you add a roll of duct tape to your purchase."
1,POS Product,Don't waste your money on these things. They don't stay on even when fastened with duct tape. Total junk. Not even worth a try.
1,tape is weak and doesn't stick,I bought these for my dog in heat and the tape is weak and it fell off on about 70% of the diapers. Definitely would not recommend this product.
4,Works really well when it stays on,"These doggie diapers work well when they stay on. I have a lot of troble keeping them on my 17 year old Min Pin, they slide off even with the velcro strips pulled tight. Overall they do save some of the accidents from happening on the floor."
1,Waste of Money,The velcro straps break off every single time. We have to use safety pins to get them to stay on. Would never buy these again.
3,Doggy diapers,I didn't care too much for these diapers. They are very absorbent but the fasteners do not stay put. I would not buy them again.
2,Horrible,I bought these for my dog in heat and every one of them ended up ripping at the velcro attachment. I even got the right size. They are not flexible at all; when she sits or lays down they just rip. I've just started buying baby pull ups and cutting holes in them for her tail.
3,propositions for poopy puppies,"we have had this dog for over a year. we have tried frequent walks, pads (usually he misses by a few inches), other diapers (he can take them off) and these. these are the only ones that stay on and it is handy and more hygienic to have a diaper in which to wrap the am...er...poopy puppy products...i would not reuse, Velcro would be better than gummy ties but this is exactly the right size for a 17 month old silky terrier, who now lays back as a toddler would assuming the diaper position. all we need is a video.we have now had the dog for over two years. NONE of the diapers stay on, this one did the longest. we finally do have a backyard now not that he uses it, but since he's in a house he has more space and gets taken out more often...my suggestion is if you want your dog to wear it, start when you first get the puppy, or else dog will take it off."
3,WORKS IN A PINCH; EXPENSIVE,I purchased these diapers for my incontinent maltese. They are nice but I did notice sometimes they leak. They also tend to slip down her tail and come off. After she has urinated in them the weight of them pulls them off her back no matter how tightly I put them on. They are also expensive as my dog is on a diuretic and goes often. I would only use these in a pinch or if you are going out and need to use a disposable diaper but not for regular use. I would purchase the washable dog diapers instead.
4,improved tabs,"Sometime in the second half of 08, they improved the tabs. Before that, they'd break off all the time and I'd have to use masking tape in place of the tabs. After the improvement, I haven't had any tabs break, and my dogs have been through a lot of diapers! As for the fit, they stay on fine on one of the dogs (curly fur), but the other dog (smooth fur) I have to keep a doggy t-shirt on her and tape the diaper to the shirt, so it depends on the dog."
2,Not as specified,"We purchased the product that was for 15-35 pound dogs. Our dog weighs 19 pounds but the diaper was way too small, it did not cover his penis ans was therfore useless."
4,Cat Diapers,"We bought these for our sick cat who was down to 6 pounds. They worked just fine and helped keep her clean, since she couldn't any more."
3,Doggie Diaper Review,"These diapers are OK, but not great. Simple Solutions also carries a diaper at the Pet Store that has a print.For some reason (maybe it's the extra print ink) they tend to hold more. They are definitely worth the extra dollar or two.The diaper featured above...We go through they really quickly. They don't hold nearly as much.I have pugs. Our female is elderly and we have had to put her in diapers within the last few months."
2,not great,"They keep the dog dry when they stay on. There is a problem with the design of the tabs. They don't always come off correctly then you have to throw the diaper away. They are expensive enough without having to waste them for no good reason. I switched brands. Also, if your dog is incontinent, please bring him or her to a vet. There are great medications that correct the problem. I was resistant to giving her drugs but they really work and we are both happier."
3,Dog Diaper Review,"I have bought these dog diapers at Petsmart for much more money so I thought I would try Amazon to see if the quality was the same. It is not. The diapers I got from Amazon seem to be second rate because the tabs don't hold as well as the ones from Petsmart. So I come home thinking I am protecting my carpet from my older dog having an accident, and I find the diaper waiting for me at the door where it has fallen off of him because the tabs don't stick. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Dog diapers...not as described,I ordered these for a 1 year old maltese who weighs 4 pounds...the Diapers swallowed her! I ended up getting newborn diapers from walmart and cutting a hole for he tail! These are NOT worth the money and you cannot return them once they are opened! They also do not send a sample diaper so you dont have to open the package!
2,This tripod has problems,"After five months of intensive use in New Zealand, I'm pretty unimpressed with this item. On paper, it seems to be a great comprimise - light enough for backpacking, but sturdy enough for a decent shot.Unfortunately, this doesn't stand up to much real use. The tripod clamps seem to have an intrinsic fault that causes the plastic around the clamp arm to snap off under any real use. This has already happened on 2 of my 3 legs, and I haven't used it nearly as much as many would.Not recommended for any serious use."
4,Great budget tripod for travel purposes,"I have used this tripod on many vacations, including extensive hiking in Yosemite park. This is a light and durable tripod for travel usage. I have found it to be fantastic, with a few limitations.1. The tripod is light for travel, but too light for serious photography in windy conditions. Don't put a SLR w/ a large lens on this tripod. The longest focal length I'd go is 200mm.2. The head will limit your ability to take great shots. It's the typical consumer head that will sometimes move a little between shots. Don't expect miracles.3. If you're not careful, you can break the plastic things that hold the legs.Having said that, you'd have to spend way more $ to overcome these limitations. It's a great budget tripod."
3,weak,"All plastic no metal, weak but usable. The ones sold at Home Depot or Grainger are much stronger. don't know why there is a min. number of words required in a review."
4,pretty good beer,"...this was my first batch and it turned out to be a good tasting beer. Watery if you only let it ferment for 2 weeks, but at 4 or 5 weeks it turns out to be a good beer. The beers I buy from the store are good quality and kind of expensive ($9-12) for a six pack, but I still thought this high canadian draft was pretty good. Especially considering I made it myself with little effort. I'll make it again, but I'll add the Pale Export to it instead of the booster."
3,Mr. Beer High Country Canadian Draft Refill Brew Pack,"This is the third time I have made the Mr. Beer High Country Canadian Draft Refill Brew Pack. I guess that says something. This beer needs to age some, at least 5 weeks from brew day. It seems to get better with age. I have added honey to two different batches. If You are going to add honey, back off a little on the booster, otherwise you can end up with cider tasting beer. will probably try again this time with a hop addition (Cascade Pellet Hops)."
2,Packaging all but destroyed the book.,"You may want to switch the packaging over to something more protective, like bubble-lined envelopes or something, because the thin envelope that I received my book in had been damaged and the book was completely bent diagonally in half."
3,Charlie St. Cloud,"Book was a bit hokey and science fiction, but did raise some eternal questions about relationships and what happens after death."
5,Touching,"This is a touching book that will pull at your heart strings and lead you to look at your own life. With eerie twists, this bok will keep the reader turning pages. ""What have you done with the gift you have been given""?"
5,Is there life after death?,"A page-turner. I ordered it because our whole community is reading this book and the author was supposed to come and discuss it. (Turns out he was stuck in an airport and never made it.) But once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Fascinating ideas which are very well drawn. We are sharing it with our neighbors"
4,"great, quick read","This was a great, quick read. I read it in one sitting on an airplane. It could comparable to a cheesy romantic movie, but I enjoyed it more. It may be because I enjoyed the setting (New England) and the hobbies (sailing). But the characters were decently developed, and the plot moved along quickly. I recommend it for everyone, especially since it isn't too long."
3,Sixth Sense?,"This book was brought to my attention by one of my book club members who nominated it. She loved it and thought it would make for an enlightening discussion. After having read it, I am happy that it was not selected. I thought the book was a pleasant, touching read, but far from profound. It seemed to be a combination of the intriguing Sixth Sense and the awful Lovely Bones (Alice Seabold). The combination made for a book that I wouldn't recommend to a friend, but that I'm not upset I read. If you have nothing else to read and want a quick, light, read, pick it up--but if you're looking for something deep or thought provoking, look elsewhere."
2,"Love the movie, disappointed by the book","I absolutely loved the movie! I saw the movie first, then decided to pick up the book. The book, though, reminded me of a Nicholas Sparks book, and again, I'm a fan of the movies, but not the books themselves. If you like Nicholas Sparks, you'll probably like this; if you don't, then steer clear!"
5,Perfect!,"Never, until I opened Charlie St. Cloud, has a book interrupted my life. I stayed up late reading page after page and once I gave in to sleep, I awoke early and snuck some pages in before MommyHood called me to duty. I ignored the laundry and forgot about the dishes because I needed to know what happen to Charlie, Sam and Tess. I was sucked into the world Ben Sherwood created and I loved every minute of it.Okay, Zac Efron's face on the cover made me pick up the book, but the story inside more than satisfied. The unexpected twists fulfilled the need for depth and the bond between characters warmed my heart and softened my soul.The underlining story is one to learn from: holding on to the past disrupts the person within you...Brilliant!One can only hope the movie is as gripping (*everybody laughs*)."
3,Predictable,"Warning...spoilers!!I guess maybe I am one of the few that did not think this book was all too amazing? I thought it was very predictable. There really were not any ""surprises"" as I had thought there would be. I knew right away that Tess was a ghost. I had a feeling she wasn't really dead either.I can definitely see that this book will be a great movie though! I think that it will be better played and that the twists won't be so obvious.It was an ok book...just not a great one."
5,Moving Story- Great Read,I had been meaning to read this book for quite some time now. I had purchased the movie but refused to watch it until I had read the book. With that said the book was a quick read with a moving story line about overcoming different obstacles and finding true love. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend it .
3,So sweet!,This book is so sweet there are also sad parts of the movie.This book Will make you cry it's so sad
4,So much more than the movie,"Saw the movie first, which lead me to read the book. I must say, I enjoyed the book so much more. I felt the book was so much more detailed, the characters more fleshed out, the plot so much deeper. I would recommend this book to any all."
5,A simply beautiful story to explain death and transition.,"I was given this book to read by the Chaplain in our Hospice organization. Since I lead a bereavement group, I found this book to be very helpful to me especially for the living, but also to help grieving survivors. In such a beautiful way the story helps survivors experience death from both sides. And it is an easy read...in fact, it is a book that can't be put down. I will add this to our recommended booklist."
5,5 Star Perfection,The Book I ordered was in excellent condition just as the seller assured. First purchase I have ever made on Amazon.com and I am now hooked. ! Thank you!
4,Good and Entertaining,"This book a nice summer read. It is a very good story. Somewhat unrealistic, but still entertaining. There were some confusing points but they tended to straighten themselves out as the book went on."
4,Weird,"This book was a little weird for me. I have to say, it's a page turner and it's written extremely well. I have yet to see the movie, but I definitely want to after reading the book."
2,Mediocre at best (May contain spoilers),"I had high hopes for this book, I really did. After seeing the trailer for the movie, I immediately ran to the bookstore to purchase this. What a disappointment! The story had the potential to make a great work of fiction. Instead, it was overly sentimental, tacky, and quite frankly, vain. Love at first sight, sex with a woman you've known for a 24 hours, thoughts of suicide: these are ingredients for a half decent Lifetime movie, not literature. It's an easy read well suited for a summer afternoon, but you may loose a few brain cells along the way."
2,Ick,"Deeply derivative, with vomit-inducing sentimentallity. There's nothing wrong with being sentimental, but this is cliched and mawkish. I am disturbed by the rave reviews from other readers."
5,Triumphant and Transcendent,"Laura Nyro's New York Tendaberry was released in 1969 and climbed to #32 on the Billboard Charts. It was to be her highest appearance and one that befitted a work of such honesty and urgency.The subject matter of the record is very much in tune with the social and political climate of when is was released in today's world. The need to Save the Country is great.The album revolves around Nyro's piano. Hammering out bluesy, repetitious block chords she summons the spirit of the city in each and every movement. In songs such as Tom Cat Goodby and Sweet Lovin' Baby there are whispers of strings which appear and dissapear in almost the same instance. In other songs, Captain for Dark Mornings, Save the Country, and Gibson Street, horns punch out the darkness and drive the track along a dark, dramatic course."
4,New York Tendaberry - 4.5 stars,"I've been listening to this album off and on for the past 3 years - the first few times I hated it because although I hear Laura's passionate delivery along with clever lyrics, I simply could not get into the songs because the arrangements are so different from the type of music I typically enjoy.I don't know why I decided to listen to it over the Thanksgiving holiday but it was as if whatever veil had blocked me from enjoying it before was lifted and I was hearing it for the first time. It was interesting reading reviews from other listeners who grew to love this collection over time - I would agree in encouraging those who are just discovering Laura Nyro to give this album time to ""marinate"" on your brain, give it a few listens over time because when you do GET IT, you will love it!My favorite tracks are: YOU DON'T LOVE ME WHEN I CRY; THE MAN WHO SENDS ME HOME; SAVE THE COUNTRY; NEW YORK TENDABERRY; SWEET LOVIN' BABY; GIBSOM STREET & CAPTAIN FOR DARK MORNINGS."
4,NY Tendaberry by Laura Nyro,"The 1969 classic tome from La Nyro not only holds up well, but acts like a clarion beacon to wake up and small the Hailburton in a way that still cajoles, entices and alarms us.Clear as a bell as far as I am concerned.We miss you Miss Laura."
5,Simply Superb,"Laura Nyro's New York Tendaberry is undeniably the greatest album production of the pop musical era, and it ought to be recognized as a classic achievement in all of American music. ""Mercy on Broadway"" is a legitimate art song in any genre. No one has ever captured the soul of New York City like Laura Nyro on this concept album. From hearing her in concert, I can avow that her voice rang true. No other vocalist was ever so sensually alive with stunning shades of emotion. You can even sense her lipstick on ""Tom Cat Blues."""
2,not enough information,.. to be much use in reality. Scant information interspersed with tiresome and even occassionally glib remarks. A very disappointing book for two reasons; the amount of information provided and the style in which author eeks it out.
1,Possibly good product - bad condition,"The book was listed as ""new"", but arrived as anything but new. The cover was dogeared, the pages were ruffled, and there was markings on the edges of the pages in black marker. It looked like a reject from a lending library. When I contacted the seller, they advised that the book had been only read once. How is this new? Anyway, I returned the book."
4,I have the whole series...,"I love THE LAURA INGALLS YEARS and the ROSE YEARS. In the later ROSE books, Rose is a little more fiesty and romantical...it builds up as the series goes along, so this is more for pre-teens and teens later on. Otherwise it is very wholesome and fun; Rose is interesting, and has many ideas about the world! I have all the LAURA YEARS books except THE FIRST FOUR YEARS and all the ROSE books except ON THE BANKS OF THE BAYOU (my fave) and BACHELOR GIRL (haven't read that yet)...."
5,book order review,"book was in good shape, was mailed out in a timely manner. price was excellent, no problems at all. thank you Kathy"
4,drums,Great product but was only disappointed because sent one drum instead of combination which was ordered but very satified with the one recived- good quality!
1,Good drum but misleading ad,"Ordered 2 sizes of the Remo drum for my grandson. They each came with 2 mallets. Thats OK except due to the misleading ad we ordered another mallet in a ""Amazon Special"" Ended up with 2 drums and 5 mallets. To add insult to injury, we had to pay frieght on the single mallet. Grandson loves drums but this is the first time I felt ripped off by a Amazon ad. Also, ad did not give ages for kids. On the large drum it is for children 5 and older. For the smaller drum it is designed for ages 3 and older. My little guy is only 1 but loves the drums. Just needs to be watched."
3,Good drum but costly,Its a nice drum but the picture was misleading. Thought it was a 3-piece set thus the higher price but that was not the case. My son is a year old and beats it frist thing every morning. He loves it
3,Good Product Deceptive Picture,This drum is the same quality that my daughter uses at music class. If you want a gathering drum of high quality this is a perfect product for you. However is you want 3 drums don't buy this the photo is deceptive. Like others I purchased this because I thought I was getting 3 drums and you are only getting 1 gathering drum. I would have rather have gotten the bongos and the Tom Tom drum for the price because I wanted multiple drums at my house for playgroups. I also really wanted the standing drum since my daughter is a new walker and sitting is not of great interest these days. I gave this 3 stars because it was decptively advertised. I would give the 1 drum 5 stars if the picture was changed and though expensive I have seen this drum other places for around $75 so the price on Amazon is reasonable for this product.
3,Average Cost/Value Ratio,"The rowing machine was easy to assemble, stores nicely, works smoothly and I can get an excellent workout WHEN I can set the exercise paramaters correctly in the programable box."
4,display is fine when seat is back...,"It's very quiet and a nice machine. Mine was also dropped(probably UPS) but only had a small dent in one of the metal end pieces so with a little tweaking, went together ok.The display does look like all 8's when your knees are bent, and you are looking down at the display, but you can see the numbers just fine when you are in the extended, seat back position. Don't know what the bid deal is, you can't really expect to look straight down and see clearly with that type of display, so don't let it discourage you from this item."
3,"It's an okay game, but....","The thing that realy struck me is that lego doesn't make the alien racers! I went on the lego website and they don't have them there!! Oh, now let's get on topic....It's an okay game. But the graphics are very horrible. When you get struck by a missle, you just spin around. What the heck? Anyway, it's a kinda sucessful racing game. But when you make U turns you go haywire. So that's my review."
5,Excellent but cautious spectulation on Jesus' upbringing,"Fr. Deiss is, I'll admit, an author to whom I am very partial; this book is another example of why. Fr. Deiss is a cautious scholar, careful to distinguish between reasonable assumptions and facts. He wears his scholarship lightly - the book is very readable. The strength of the book, however, is that one can read a reasonable ""childhood biography"" of Jesus without constantly sorting out the author's bias. Especially useful are his depictions of Joseph and Mary - a depiction less ""poverty bound"" than some of the scholars who build a more ""politizing"" background for Jesus."
3,Creative design for young lades,"The design is creative and suitable for young ladies.If the color of the string can be brighter, it will be perfect!"
5,User Guide for Getting an iLife!,"You'd think that iPhoto, as easy as it is to use, wouldn't require a manual at all. In one sense, that's true: the program is really intuitive to work with, and a much more enjoyable application than, say, Clock or Calculator. That's why the manual is missing.But this book does more than show you how to use iPhoto: it provides ideas on expanding what you do with it, so this useful photo organizer/manipulator can become a more important part of your iLife."
5,The Missing Manual Does It Again!!!,"I have showered so much praise on these 'Missing Manual' books it may seem like I am getting paid by David Pogue himself to write these reviews, but I guarantee you that is not the case!!Full of crisp, clear, color photos that jump off the page, a writing style that is fun and easy to follow, and a layout that is second to none, there simply is no line of books for learning applications on the market that is better than the 'Missing Manual' series.If you use an application (whatever it is) and you want to learn to use the tool in question, forget going online or taking a class. Either it will be a waste of time, money or both!!! Just look at the name of the app you are interested in, see if there is a Missing Manual book for it and BUY IT.These books are that good, that impressive, that well written, and that well published. I put the highest stamp of approval on this line by O'Reilly.***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION"
5,Good through college and beyond!,"I got this cookbook in college and it is still one of my most used cookbooks, 20 years later, second only to Joy of Cooking. The recipe for fish dilled and cooked in foil is one of our household favorites. It's a great book to help new cooks set up a kitchen for the first time. Highly recommended."
2,Tinny sound,Cd Radio is styled nicely but quality is poor. Installation template that came with radio was not correct for this product. Radio reception was poor. Remote buttons tended to get stuck. I don't think I am going to keep it. It is hard to find a reasonably priced alternative. The Bose product is [much more] . Not much in between.
1,Garbage,"Bought this unit on clearance at Target. The radio reception was always poor. CDs played OK, but sound quality was low. After 8 months of use the system died while playing a CD. Now it cannot be turned on and the CD is stuck inside. Neither Target nor the manufacturer are willing to offer anything beyond the original 90 day warrantee. DON'T BUY IT!"
3,Great if on clearance,"I, too, bought this item for 75% off. With that in mind, I love this product. It was tough to install, but with patience, I got it installed. The design is sleek and works well in my kitchen which is quickly becoming a shrine to Michael Graves. There are a few things that I wish this would have:The clock does not glow in the dark, so walking into a dark kitchen you will not know what time it is unless you turn on the light.The stations on the radio do not come in as clearly as one would like, but that is typical with under the counter CD playersI wish it had an auxillary plug-in on it so that you can plug things into it and work with the timer to turn things automatically (my last under the unit did this).Other than that, I do not suggest buying this product at full price."
2,this stinks,"I bought this on clearance for half price. Thought it was a good deal. Wrong!!! The cd player worked for one day only. The sound quality is poor and can't get a lot of stations in clearly. Poor, poor, poor....."
3,"If you're looking for a mentoring structure, a good start.","This book begins with a discussion of mentoring and when and why it might be appropriate. General issues regarding mentoring are discussed, such as finding mentors, developing relationships, involving school personnel, parents and the community. The book then goes into the specific mentoring project entitled ""The Mentor Program."" Several questionnaires and forms are included for reference (although the forms are copyrighted). This book explains that successful mentorships don't just happen and aren't always easy to set up. Several ""how to"" suggestions appear throughout the book. Of special interest is the preparation for participation in the first aspect of the program called the ""Mentor Seminar."" That is a prerequisite for participating in the ""Mentor Field Experience,"" the actual mentor relationship. Some good ideas can be gleaned from examining how this program was set up and where it succeeded."
2,cute LITTLE book but.....,"This is a children's book, I presume for someone pre-K, but the objects are printed in black and white and they are small. A little dated (1967) with a Victorian theme, some of the words do not go with the pictures. What appears to be a spool of thread is called a reel and so on.Also, because the pictures are so small, some of them are not clear. It is hard to make out the picture of a brush. Some of the fruit look like balls. If I didn't see the word below I wouldn't know what it is so how could I assume my grandson would learn the word.Words like endive (a lettuce), rookery and pomegranite seem out-of-place. I'll keep it because it is cute and maybe some child will appreciate it when they are older but for right now it is going on to the back shelf of a closet."
1,Vista and Windows 7 users beware.,"The CD that comes with the unit does not have drivers for Vista or Windows 7. You have to go to the Engenius website to find them. Downloading and installing has been a huge hassle. I still don't have it working. And the Users Manual, both on the CD and on the website, has not been updated to include Vista or Windows 7. The installation/operating instructions are totally unapplicable for Vista/7 users. Also, the cable connector to the Engenius port is very delicate and makes only intermittent contact. If you're running Vista or Windows 7, do not buy this product."
1,"EnGenius EUB-362 EXT - Network adapter - Hi-Speed USB - 802.11b, 802.11g",i will give this one star . i had this about month and 1/2 and it want out on me . i would not buy nother one at all .
1,Worthless,Do not buy this is you use windows 7. There is no driver and I was not able to find one on the web.
4,So much better than those usb flash drive adapters!,"i bought this product praying that it would boost mt connection for online gaming, i had the basic wireless g cisco netbook adapter that was a total bust i would lag like crazy and it was even more expenisve than this adapter! i bought this hoping it would reduce my lag and it completely removeed it im getting 3 bars of 100mbs internet and am lag free 100% highly recomend it and it works easily on windows 7 ultimate just download the driver from their website"
3,Data-connectivity problems,"The unit was easy and simple to install. The signal strength indicator appeared to be as good as one could possibly expect.However, I found that I could NOT get any data to pass through the unit! (Well, RATZ.)I resolved this by UNPLUGGING the USB cable to the unit, then e-attaching it to my Windows XP computer. (I would ""loose"" the data through-put if I shut the computer off, then restarted it again; I would also ""loose"" the data connectivity if I did a restart.)Once the unit was disconnected, then re-connected, the unit played just fine. (Many hours of perfect use, with no troubles! -As long as I did not restart, etc.)The unit came with version 1.7 of the driver software on a CD; I was able to locate version 2.0 or 2.1, which I applied; No change or help was noted."
1,Could Have Done Better,"The removable antenna has an atypical RF connector. If you want to use an external antenna other than the one provided you must take the unit apart, remove the antenna cable and connect your own with a standard RF connector. What a pain. If you are not an electronic technician, stay away from this. If you don't need a external antenna other than the one provided, this will work fine."
2,not what your looking for.,"I recently purchased this item, for range extension on wifi networks.Was easy to setup etc, however the item itself does not perform as advertised.The internal card on my laptop picks up signals better than this adapter.I switched back and forth a few times in device manager, and each time i switchedto this card i lost networks that my internal card was reading with 1 bar.I just purchased a different card from a seller on amazon, and it works great, showing 5 bars nowin the same exact location.So imho you should steer clear of this one."
4,A view from the inside,"This book takes you back and gives you a private look at the planning and development of the car that started the whole Muscle Car Craze. From figuring out how to get this car built around GM's policies on horsepower to weight ratio, to fighting off the compitition in 1969 with the introduction of ""The Judge""! How they developed the Royal Pontiac cars, and how they had to fight every step of the way with the EPA, and other government agencies! Lots of photos, and history here!"
2,Some good info but many misleading and false statements,"MOTORTOWN IS WANGERS COMPANY - HAHAJim Wangers had some talents, he also liked to exaggerate his involvement and down-play or COMPLETELY DISREGARD the actual players.I would love substantiated information from him on HIS company Motortown, when I have first hand information that he was 10% owner of the company and that didn't officially happen until Motortown was in production with its first project and he bought in.When Motortown was founded there were two employees - David Landrith President and founder, and Warren Wells, Personnel Director and Dave's cousin.There are many other discrepancies throughout the book but its a decent read."
2,Original but....,"This was a very different book. It deserves a praise for its orinality but it lacks in romance. I wish author would go more into their relatioship, their feelings and thoughts."
3,Worth your time.....,"I found this book to be well worth my time. The author does a good job bringing the reader into the character's world. I would have preferred that the author bring Nora and Liz together earlier in the book, shortening the time spent describing their pasts. The ending came too soon, it would have been enjoyable to see where their lives together took them...."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am an avid Naiad/Bella reader, but I was very disappointed with Nora and Liz. I kept reading more and more thinking that it would get better, but it really didn't. If you're looking for a Karin Kallmaker-type romance, this is NOT the book for you."
3,Doing a bit of research,"PRE-REVIEW 2/25""Original Sin: Origins, Developments, Contemporary Meanings"" is one book I'm turning to to investigate various points of view of the concept of Original Sin. I'm hoping to look beyond my own (former) RCC understanding of Original Sin to see whether this concept can be well-matched to the Scriptures, since (surprise!) you'll not see this phrase in the Bible.Not that I believe in any ""goodness of man"" perspective. I am a Spirit-regenerated believer in Jesus and a grateful son of my most perfect Father. But I need not look beyond my own heart, mind, and actions, and compare this my life to the highest standards (e.g., Jesus, anger=murder), to know of the evil in man.Original Sin is being discussed and redefined by current theologians who appeal to many. With opportunity to respond to these messages, I realize that at least I have to do additional research.More to come later. Lord willing.P.Vitkus"
2,Ramblings of a Gonzo Journalist Trying to Make Rent,"I just finished (last night) ""Kingdom of Fear"" by Hunter S. Thompson. He has always been a personal fave, but his later books have lacked the energy of the earlier works.But, he can still turn a phrase. ""Its better to be shot out of a cannon, than squeezed out of a tube.""This book has the ""jumbled"" story lines that have appeared in his later work. It makes it harder to read than it ought to be.I shouldn't be reading HST while living in my current vortex of anger and frustration. Know where I can get a Kevlar vest?"
2,A Shadow of Hunter,"Somehow, I expected this book by Hunter to be edgier than it is. The cover certainly gives the impression (with HST, drink in hand, giving the finger, smoking a cigarette in an elevator with a No Smoking sign above him) that we are really gonna be in for a hell of a ride. The book disappoints.However, I did find his reflections on the day after 9/11 to be quite interesting. Even prophetic. And his trip to Cuba sort of fizzles; we never get to read how the trip ends. Or what his impressions were. Or who he got to meet. This could have really been illuminating---but Hunter just drops the trip. Stops writing about it. Provides no clarity into what his impressions of Cuba were forty years after the revolution.It seems that his lifestyle had taken a toll on his ability to write a coherent book. Compare this to Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail---and you find this book to just be a shadow of the man who so aptly described the McGovern campaign."
4,Gonzo Time Capsule,"Sure HST has done this before, but just like any good musician you still return to what you do best. It is a very interesting book, insightful and funny as hell. I recommend this book to everyone, Thompson is still a very important and genuine writer in the U.S. and this book proves that he's still on top of our culture."
3,Would not reccomend unless familar with Thompson's works.,"After reading favorable reviews I was very excited and eagerly awaiting the arrival of this book. Upon reading it I must ask the question, ""What is the purpose of this book ?"" It is for the most part a gathering of ramblings and stories of sporatic occurances. At best about half of these flashback like stories are interesting. I was actually pleased to see so many (random and out of context) photos in the book, to aid me in the laborous process of finishing the book. I must say that this is the first of Thompson's books that I have read and hope that the others aren't the same. It just seemed that the book may have been put out to fulfill a contract obligation or to make a quick buck of Thompson's name."
5,The Doctor just keeps truckin,"This book may have been billed as a memoir, but it just seemed like another collection of a combination of the Gonzo papers and the Gonzo letters volumes.It is a good read as usual, with the doctor writing about everyone and everything from his court battle over our 4th amendment rights, working as night manager at the O'Farrel, as well as dealing with an uppity out of towner that wanted to change everything about Woody Creek. That hit close to home because there are a few here in Montrose, that want to make the town everything all of us that live here don't want it to be.He also touches on our new war on ""Terrorism"" and the events leading up to this war, which still is a touchy subject. He analyzes it only like he can.So go buy or borrow a copy and enjoy. Find out why he is not fond of Judges or sheephearders near Elko. You owe it to yourself if you are a fan of Hunter S Thompson."
2,Earth To Doctor: What Happened?,"I have spent more than two decades eagerly awaiting the latest offering from the Godfather of Gonzo, the one and only Dr. Hunter S. Thompson. After finishing ""Kingdom of Fear,"" I'm afraid that anticipation will turn to dread, as the good doctor seems destined for a long, ugly slide into self-parody. We're promised a revealing memoir here; instead, we get a mishmash of tales told many times before. There are still flashes of the old Thompson wit and narrative power, but the energy and focus he brought to his classic works of the seventies has long since vanished."
5,Wonderful book,"For me this book sums up all i have lived through plus what my parents lived through. no one has explained things to me as HST did in this book. touching on everything from drugs to sports to politics to pranks HST has broadened my horizons and views on life and created something for me to explain my life better.... thank you Hunter S, Thompson I am in your debt."
4,Usual Good (twisted) Humor,"Best thing about this book is being able to read a collection of HST's comtemporary criticism while it is actually ""contemporary."""
5,The Essence of the Teaching,"Red Pine is a translator, historian, scholar and Zen practitioner. His clear writing demonstrates that he knows his own mind....the essence of the sutra's teaching. Besides, he has a great sense of humor."
5,Just including my full recommendation,"The detail and focus of this work is considerable. The Heart Sutra is only 2 pages, but this book goes on for 208 pages. Red Pine goes through the Sutra, word for word at times, helping to explain the nuances, the rich connotations of the words. Without all of this detail, it is difficult to understand completely the approach used. Because of this work, I went out and got Red Pine'sThe Diamond Sutra: The Perfection of Wisdom."
1,purchaser,It stops working almost very time it is being used. We have another one that is a Guitar hero I and it works great so I think there is a short or something in this one. Would like to return it for one that works good.
1,Beat up Guitar,I only bought the cordless guitar because i already had the game. But when i got the guitar in the mail it was in a beat up oversized box which looked like someone took out their fustration on it. Regardless to say that the guitar did not work at all. The buttons where broken and it was not working with my game. I have returned this item and waiting to get my money back. In my opinion it is better to go to the store and get a guitar there.
3,Wireless guitar for Guitar Hero PS2,"Be advised that this guitar does not work with Guitar Hero 2. There is an updated version that does work with Hero 2 and the guitar is physically identical. Some reviewers were lucky enough to receive the updated version which states on the box ""compatible with guitar hero 2."" My friend got this version from the order but I got the one that didn't work, twice. Other than that, this guitar is nice and buttons feel solid when pressed. If it works with Guitar Hero 2, i would definitely buy it and $50 from Amazon is a great price."
1,wireless guitar,I WOULDNT RECCOMMEND THE WIRELESS GUITAR..I PURCHASED ONE RETURNED BECAUSE IT WOULD CUT OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SONG...THEY SENT ME ANOTHER ONE IT DID THE SAME THING....SO I RETURNED THAT ONE ALSO....
4,Works with GH2 as of 1/5/07,"Just ordered this as of 1/5/07 and it works out-of-the-box with Guitar Hero II. No adapters necessary.Works terrific and frets have a more solid feel, except the neck of the guitar seems a little loose from the body.The only other negative is the strap is a little intrusive, otherwise very happy with it."
1,wireless guitar,The product is being returned because it does not work. Even with brand new batteries.
1,DID NOT WORK,We were not able to use this particular guitar with the Guitar Hero 2 game. I ordered two of these items and neither one worked with the game. Perhaps it's only compatible with the regular guitar hero game.
2,Bad Adapter,"Dont buy anything from this company. I bought this guitar version 1 it wont work with GH2. So they said we have an adapter so I gave them more money stupid. I got the adapter and the guitar still wont work I call for help and they tell me the same thing everytime.1. Turn off PS2 and Guitar Controller (If Wireless)2. Insert Wireless receiver/Wired Guitar Controller into the Compatibility Adapter3. Turn on PS2 with GHII inside4. Wait until the Animation begins with the Guitar players Fist in the Air, then insert the Compatibility Adapter and Wireless receiver. (it can be inserted any time after the animation begins)5. Turn on Wireless Controller6. Ensure the LED lights on Adapter (Blue), Receiver (Red), and Controller (Blue) are all solid.7. Controller is now compatible with GHIII'm going to send it back in pieces with a nice letter @#$&*#%$"
1,What a piece of junk!,"Please, for the love of all you hold dear, DO NOT BUY THIS GUITAR!!Just don't.Don't do it.Don't be tempted because it's cheaper than the RedOctane version. It's only cheaper because it doesn't work at all.The one I bought worked for less than 5 seconds brand new out of the box. Please just buy another brand... ANY brand. Buying this just wastes packing materials and your precious time because you'll only end up returning it immediately.Just hit the ""Back"" button on your browser and select another Guitar Hero guitar controller from the list.Go on, it's really for the best.Go now.*Whew!*"
2,a bit busted...,"Well, unlike the others, mine didn't come with batteries... Not that it mattered too much,but the whammy bar is busted... nothing registers. I'll have to agree that the strap is obnoxious with this model too.Oh the good side however, the strum bar is much quieter than my other guitar controller... if the whole thing worked it might be better, but there is a low control of quality on these things...."
1,don't use this guitar with GuitarHero 2,I returned this guitar originally thinking maybe I got a bad one... second one was exactly the same. It does not work well.Hold out for the one from Activision...
1,Does NOT work with Guitar Hero II,"We tried two of these controllers and NEITHER worked at all. TAC has no customer service or support phone numbers to contact. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. We purchased a replacement ""RedOctane"" wireless controller - worked perfect - first time out of the box. Amazon should not bundle or recommend the Guitar Hero II game with this controller."
1,Not As Cool As It Looks,"My fiance enjoys playing Guitar Hero (1 and 2), so I bought this wireless guitar for Christmas. However, the batteries run down quickly and it does not stay connected to the game system well. Basically, I returned it because it is simply not functional."
3,older version,older version needs a adapter to work on all of the different games GH GH II GHII R/B but very cool looking and comfertable TAC make great products check out ther line on antcommandos
1,"PS2 Guitar Mania wireless ""V"" guitar",Worked not even one day. The wireles connection kept going out. Tried to contact the shipped FOUR times on return instructions and authorization number...they never replied. I have a $50 paperweight now. Not worth the money.
5,flying VVVVVVVVVVVVVVVeeeeee,the guitar for this game is awesome and at a wonderful price... thank you amazon... you the greatest!
1,TAC Wireless Guitar,"What a piece of junk. This third-party wireless guitar costs as much as the RedOctane/Activision product it imitates, and has far less value.I was fist disappointed by the fact that there was an ""adapter"" to make it compatible with Guitar Hero 2, and that it took FOUR (4) AA's, compared to RO's three (3) AAA batteries. This was only compounded by the fact that the adapter had a very specific and un-forgiving ""procedure"" to get it to work when playing Guitar Hero 2.The guitar only worked about 30% of the time; most of my effort was spent on trying to get the adapter to work. When I was playing, the guitar did work well and felt comfortable. However, the design of the strap hooks caused the strap to fall off every couple minutes: very frustrating when you're in the middle of a tricky song!In short: spend a few extra dollars and get the quality and reliability of a first-party product. Don't cheap out on imitations like this cheap hunk of plastic."
1,wireless guitar for guitar hero,don't buy it if you want to use it for guitar hero II It does not work!there is an adapter for around 15 dollars but have not had luck with it.works for hero I though
1,Wireless V Guitar,Guitar Hero is a blast; however we were unable to get a Wireless V that would work. We were sent 2 and both of them had the same problem; the bottom 2 buttons on the frets would not work. Amazon was great to work with and took care of us!
5,Guitar only!!!,"The only brand to buy if buying the guitar only, for guitar hero, others just do not compare... Beware of guitar not made by anyone other than red octane...... Read the reviews>>>>>"
1,Doesn't work with Guitar Hero 2,"I bought this controller at a Gamecrazy and took it home with me. Busted it out and couldn't play Guitar Hero 2 with it. The fret buttons (The buttons on the neck) don't work. Even with the adapter. Oh, and the strap doesn't stay on for me. Every time I try and use the star power, the strap breaks off. (I don't thrash it around too like others when they try and use it.)Tried Guitar Hero 1 with it and it works fine."
2,"Better quality than ""The Hammer""...","While this 3rd party controller is better quality than the Psyclone Essentials ""The Hammer,"" it still is not nearly the quality of the controller that comes with the game. The buttons have far too much tension, giving you serious hand cramps, and the buttons will at times stick because of how hard you have to press them down. It seems fine for Medium difficulty songs, but for more advanced songs you will encounter serious problems with being able to hit the notes, such as a orange/green transition. I'll stick with my regular controller until I find something better than this junk."
1,Not compatible with Guitar Hero II,"This wireless guitar isn't compatible with Guitar Hero II game. An inexpensive adapter is available though. I'm really disappointed that this controller and Guitar Hero II game were listed as ""Buy these 2 together"" considering they're not compatible."
4,"Overall, very good","Where to start...I really love the feel of the fret buttons on this guitar. They're raised up a little higher than on the standard SG controller, and take a little getting used to, but overall, I felt that it was a welcome change. Also, the strum bar is tighter and not nearly as loud as the standard SG. The whammy bar is nice, easy to use and very responsive. The strap however, will not stay attached to the guitar to save its life (assuming it had one?) anyways, I just use a regular guitar strap with leather ends and it works great. (I've been playing guitar for about 6 and a half years now.) One word of caution though, for those of you who haven't already found this out, it will NOT work with Guitar Hero II out of the box, it requires a separate adapter that won't be released until around the 15th of November."
2,Incompatible,"I echo other reviews ... Amazon lists this guitar along with Guitar Hero II, but the buttons do not match GHII. It worked great for GH, though I do not think it is worth it if not compatible with GHII. Perhaps the wireless guitar Best Buy sells is by another vendor/maker."
2,Trouble with hooking up,"I've had too much trouble hooking the guitar up to play. The guitar itself is one of the nicest I've seen, it has a nice chrome strummer, but I use another guitar controller I have instead of this one. It's too much of a hassle to hook up the reciever and at the right time."
4,Pop with a difference,"I first heard this album five years ago and was immediately impressed with its pop awareness, yet again demonstrating the Stranglers' ability to adapt and change. There is a characteristic Stranglers darkness that pervades this album, though not as pronounced as on their earlier albums. As usual, the drumming is beautiful in its simplicity. They could have released a couple more good singles off this album, such as 'Non stop', but this is a fine album. By the way, it's got 'Golden Brown' as well."
2,I don't hate the Stranglers.,"I don't hate the stranglers, but I come pretty close to hating this album. This is not the stranglers at their best. They usually have a distinct punk sound, but La Folie doesn't have this at all. There are only two decent songs on this album - Let Me Introduce you to the Family, and (I'm almost ashamed to admit I like such a comercially successful song, especially one which is telling us how great heroin is) Golden Brown. The record as a whole, though, is lacking any kind of edge or rawness to it. It just seems watered down, and as if the band didn't want to do it and couldn't be bothered. There is simply no energy to it. Alot of people buy La Folie just for the track Golden Brown. If you are about to join that group of people, DON'T! Golden Brown is also on The Best of the Stranglers, which is a far far better record, so buy that instead."
5,The Stranglers at their Best,"In response to the reviews below; I'm afraid you are both aesthetically AND intellectually challenged if you can't enjoy this record because of the subject matter.It's your loss.But then again, The Stranglers aren't for everyone..."
4,Not Bad,"I bought this mainly for the barometer and anemomter features to have along for fishing and hunting trips. Both of these features work very well, as well as the hygrometer. The unit shows these in real time, tracks changes and records minimum and maximum events.The only feature that doesn't work well is the altimeter. I don't know what theory or system is used but it isn't accurate, at least not on my unit. I can be sitting in the same place and watch the altitude go up and down without moving it. It's very seldom that it remains stable. I can understand some fluctuation +/- a couple of feet but it goes beyond that. Since the altimeter wasn't an important feature for me it's not a bother.The unit seems to be made well and hopefully proves to be reasonably durable, which I think it will. It's a bit pricey but I got a better deal on Amazon than I found anywhere else. All in all it's not a bad little unit."
4,"Pretty good, but a couple of annoyances","The product does mainly what it claims, and it does it well. However, there are a few niggles. Firstly, it emits a beep every time it logs a data point, and there is no way to turn this off. Secondly, it NEEDS a Brunton IR-dongle to download logs - the IrDA standard is not supported. And there are no drivers for the IR-dongle on 64-bit Vista. Thirdly, the log file format isn't documented anywhere, so there is no good way to import the information into your own application for further processing. These nits aside, the product is good. I use mine a lot, and I'm very happy with it."
5,weather Instrument,"I am very pleased with my purchase, I would recommend to anyone needing weather information. I use in my volunteer job as a weather spotter.Vernon Sneed"
4,Solid!,This product is strong and solidly built. The satin nickel finish makes it look very stylish and contemporary. I'm satisfied except that the one pictured on Amazon website shows white tubing on the end/handles but did not come with the product! i was disappointed with that aspect as the tubing helps to prevent scratches.
1,Sad,"What passes for literature these days? Is this what people are reading and learning from? If so, this world is in worst shape than I imagined. This book is just more of the same stereotype filled garbage that's out there. It hurts to know that a young Black female wrote this book for other young Black females to read. If we do not respect ourselves, no one else ever will. The author mentions a number of different books that she has been exposed to. This book does not even come close. What is there to be gained by reading this book? I pray that as this young lady matures, she will write books designed to educate and inspire, not merely string together nasty words and scenarios designed to arouse the reader and make a quick buck on the backs of our youngsters."
3,The Game Chose Who?,"From start to finish this book was a good read, and I can honestly say I have never read a setup scene like the one that went down in this book. Just when you think you have everything (...)Great first book for Ebony. Outside of the obvious spelling and grammatical errors the story was very interesting."
4,Resilent & Blessed,"Young Mahogany was suddenly thrown into a life of betrayal, pain and heartbreak at the sudden murder of her mother, the only relative who truly loved her. Her aunts and cousins hoard hate, jealousy and malice towards Mahogany unjustly; and now they have free reign to let her know ALL about it.Despite all the hurt (mental & physical)she endures from her family and so-called friends, she has a boyfriend that tries to get her steady and look out for her best interest - but then his male hormones prevail, and once again Mahogany is left to fend for herself. With the innate spirit to survive and press on, the young lady prevails regardless of her abortion, racist psychiatrist, denied college education and family abandonment, but only after becoming victim to the jail system.The message is clear and a roadmap for those who seek guidance in the harsh game of life. This is a book not to be ignored."
3,Very good book,Very good book. I would recommend to a friend. I will read more from this publishing company. True to life events.
4,Good but unbelievable,"While this book was entertaining, it wasn't believable to me! I couldn't believe that so many bad things could happen to one person in such a short amount of time. I enjoyed reading this and I think you will too."
4,A return to great literature,"Robert Ashcom is a master of sewing magic and emotion into the English language.His newest novel, WINTER RUN, invites readers to walk through rural Virginia in the 1940s. The story is set around Charlie, a curious, adventuresome boy (think Huck Finn) and his family, friends, animals and farm. It is with these aspects of life - family, friends and duty - that the proud young boy becomes a strong but sensitive man.Now, most critics may associate 'rural' with boring, but not so in WINTER RUN. What audiences must pay attention to, in my opinion, is Ashcom's verbal sorcery.He snaps photographs with words and tells fireside stories with narrative; his work commands the attention of anyone with serious interest in American literature."
5,A classic in the literature,"Simply powerful, beautifully written. If you are interested in Indian boarding school history you must read this book by a Hopi scholar."
2,quite repetitive,"The book was informative, however the way it was structured was very repetitive. Many sentences in different chapters were almost identical. This format might be useful for a reference book such as an encyclopedia, however this book lacks enough information to be an encyclopedia."
2,they Called it Prairie Light,"It would have been better if it had not been a duplicate of many other Native Stories I have read- just with a different tribe. I don't wish to make light of their situation in that boarding school, I just wish it would have had more about the families and their traditions-things that are unique to that tribe"
4,Nicro 2 speed vent,"I purchased this vent to keep the"" stale air ""smell out of our 42' boat. I keep the switch on low. It does a good job, however the motor has had a vibration noise since day one. It draws very low amperage, and is still working after several years. I only gave it 4 stars because of the noise."
1,Don't buy!!!,I bought these disks for use with the NEC ND-1100A drive. So far I tried 6 disks: 3 worked fine and 3 failed to read after the burn. That is 50% of failures!!! They also fail to be re-recorded as well. Neither of the 2 PC DVD drives (NEC and SAMSUNG SD-616T) nor the Sony DVP-NS415 player recognize those that failed. I had no problem with the Fujifilm DVD+RW using the same software and hardware. I believe that this issue is caused by the poor quality of the media.
2,I really expected more..,"First of all - i'm sorry for spelling mistakes that i ,might have...I'm not from the U.S ...Well, when i ordered the book, and looked at the other reviews, i was sure that i am buying the best book about Wire chrochet.Finally, when it arrived to my Mail Box, I was a little disapointed.The projects looked as if someone very young and inexperienced made them, Finishes are not high Quality, Projects are not so good looking , and i really need to buy another book of Wire crochet."
5,Crochet With Wire,I've read most of the book but because this is such a busy time of year I have not had a chance to work any of the projects. I am looking forward to trying many of them when I get a chance. The jewelry looks like fun to make and pretty to wear.
2,Not for me,I rated this book as I did because I found that the best design I would be interested in making is on the front cover. I expected the quality of the designs inside to be just as elegant. This is just my opinion based upon what I was looking for. For someone else this book may be just the right mix of variety of designs for them.
4,Fun Book,This book is fun. Lots of fun ideas. When you tell people you crocheted with wire they look at you like you are from Pluto. Lots of fun and beautiful jewelry.
3,Sorry a bit difficult,I did like the book but found it very hard to understand being a visual person for me it was hard to understand some of the project without the pictures. But fill with beautiful projects
5,wolverine reimagined,"the wolverine animated series , a slightly different perspective of our favorite adamantium clawed hero . very cool great animation for lovers of both genres anime / comic book heroes . 5 STARS & 2 THUMBS UP....."
5,awesome,"The marvel Wolverine animated series is very original and spot on with details about logan,even though somethings differ the plot story and action are what you come to expect from anime and marvel. It would be nice to see a second series behind this because this one was amazing!! I highly recommend it!!"
4,If at first you don't succeed....,First I am wondering where my first review disappeared to? It coudn't have been that it was unfavourable.Anyway when I first ordered the watch I received a defective unit. A quick call to Amazon and a new watch was delivered two days later in perfect working order. The defective unit was sent back at Amazon's expense. Very seamless and easy.Now to the watch: I travel overseas and across multiple time zones and this watch was exactly what I was looking for combining function and form. This watch does that well. It looks great (just a tad thick but not too bad) and the way you can swap out time zones is great. It does come with a steep learning curve and it will take some concerted effort to master it's functions but it is well worth it. And the price was outstanding.
2,Not what I expected,The watch feels light and not consistant with the quality I expected. The use of the different time zones is a little difficult and the chronograph when used for a longer period of time does not respond to a push on the crown to stop the timing on my watch. The touch face is a novelty and fun. I find the digital display needs careful reading to make out.
3,Looks good but is quite heavy,"I bought this watch for my husband and I regretted it as soon as it came. Don't take it wrong, it's a great watch, it works perfectly, people love the touch function, and it looks very stylish, but it's quite bulky and heavy. Probably if you like heavy/bulky watches is ok, but I recommend you try it on in some shop before buying it online."
5,Perfect faucet,"I got this faucet at a very good price on the Friday sale and it is beautiful. My plumber loved it -- he said it was quality. Before I had a problem with the spout being too short and water getting on the sink surrounding the basin when washing. This solves the problem and is lovely also. Five stars. Well, eight months later and a piece broke. Danze is willing to replace the piece (if I knew what is was) but as I'm in Mexico, it's a hardship. I still have to pay the plumber to install it again if I get the piece."
3,Looks good and but doesn't last,"I bought this faucet a couple years ago when re-doing my bathroom. The black finish is now coming off all over to expose the metal underneath. Considering the cost, this should not have happened. Don't buy if you're hoping for longevity with this product."
2,Finish Didn't Hold Up,"I bought an oil bronzed Danze bathroom faucet about three years ago and the finish started wearing off after about a year. Given the price I paid, I was very disappointed. I noticed the Danze products have received high customer ratings here on Amazon to leave me wondering if they have someone stuffing the ballot box, or if the reviewers have simply not had these long enough to be aware of the finish problem."
5,excellent,"This book is one of a series for a child with advance attitude for nature and the science of animals, in this case: Australia. These books, as a series, are a collector item for the complete set of six (6) books. The average child will leave this book on the shelf as it is beyond his level, thus this book is excellent for the child whose needs goes far beyond what the environment can offer. The photographs are of the highest quality, and any one picture would rate an award at just about any show of photograph prints."
2,There are better programs,"4.0 Student is a good concept, but the site is marginal at best. They don't support the new Palm conduit for such items as the Treo 650. If you have a palm device and you switch to another format, such as Pocket PC, you are forced to purchase another license.I'd suggest ""The Dog Ate It"" or ""GoBinder"" as you don't pay a yearly fee and the information is retained on your computer."
2,mediocre kung fu adventure at best.,"The selling point to this is that it has like 7 of the biggest names in the biz. John Liu, angela Mao, Lo Lieh, Beardy, a swordsman who I should know the name of, and the baddie from jet li's iron rooster vs. centipede(this is only the second movie I have ever seen him in). So the story is ok, and other than the final fight and seeing john liu's leg go up high, this really sucked. It is like they didn't even try to make it look like any contact was made. The facial expressions sell what is going on, but I need SOME sort of realism in a serious movie like this."
5,Finally! I can feel and see results.,"I was spending 2+ hours a day at the gym, 5 days a week. In the beginning I saw results, but then I would taper off. I watched this DVD, now I'm at the gym 45 mins, 4 days a week and I am getting double to triple the results. I can actually feel and see my body getting stronger.This DVD enlightened me that I was doing many exercises, but that I wasn't actually hitting each muscle completely. I love how this DVD shows you that you don't have to do a ton of exercises and a ton of sets to achieve results. I love POF! I love going to the gym now."
4,Body Building,Excellent video demonstrating proper form for the best exercises to use for following weight training/body building using the POF method.
1,Don't buy this stroller,"I bought and sold this stroller without even taking it around the block. If you're used to pushing a Maclaren, this Kidco does not have near the manuverability I'm used to. It was 19 lbs (too heavy) and the backrest was made of metal stays that seemed uncomfortable. The price is just right however, for $85 if you really need a stroller with an umbrella fold that takes an infant car seat - this is it. Until Mac makes the perfect stroller (sorry the Techno XLR missed the boat with a rigid car seat bar), I'll stick with my Zooper Hula (though a new one runs $269)."
3,Does it job well but,Sound quality so so. I has the in ear series b4 and was great. One thing is it is good for sports cos they dont fall off your ear and the cord length is just right.
2,really flimsy,"The sound is fine, the fit is good, but the headpiece broke right at the thinnest point with very little force. Both sides. Within about 60 days."
2,"Base, Base and more Base",If you like base the phones will give it to you. It has so much that you have a hard time hearing anything else. You can hardly hear the trebal which is flat and tinny. I don't like them at all.
4,Surprisingly good,"Can't go wrong for the price. When positioned properly in the ears, the sound is very acceptable, loud, and clear. A little flimsy but for the cost, I'd just buy another pair if they broke."
4,inexpensive and functional,"I have been shopping around for ""workout"" headphones for a while, and finally settled on these. The in-the-ear headphones that are so popular these days don't stay in my ears. I've tried various brands and sizes. Since I mostly use these headphones for listening to audio books, I have no complaints about the sound quality, and ambient sounds are still heard which is good when running in the city. The only downside is that they don't come with a case."
5,Great set of headphones,"I've owned these headphones for about 6 years and they work great. I bought a second set as a gift for a friend, and she is very happy with them as well. The wires seem to be securely fastened so you don't get that annoying effect where the sound cuts in and out after a few years of use. The only problem I ever had was when I rolled over mine with my chair, but I fixed that with a soldering iron. I would definitely recommend these to others."
3,Sound quality mediocre,"I guess the sound is OK for the price. However, the sound is not nearly as good as the Sony MDR-A30 that this replaced, an older model that cost about the same and are a similar style. An A/B comparison shows these to sound muddy, the midrange and treble sound buried."
1,Not worth it,It is too difficult/impossible to align and very very fragile anda typical flight is very short as it does not hold a charge well
2,Flawed toy,"I've used some of the other copters notably by Air Hogs and nothing steers ""great"" in the $20 range but this toy unfortunately does not steer nearly as well (not that the Air Hogs line is all that great). You would be better off with some of the other copters.This toy uses an infrared controller not RC (like all the others at this price)."
3,Helos for little girls,"Very good flyers and the little girls (4 and 6) were impressed. Unfortunately, the motor on one died, after only a couple of flights. Happily, I bought three, so can replace that one. I know that the toy is not really intended for children that young, but the motor failure was not due to their mishandling, because there was lots of adult supervision."
2,Just for whimsy,"Do not expect a flying machine here. Expect a half controllable toy.I bought mine because it was so cheap. I got cheap. It flies, but very hard to control. It is durable from what I have seen. My dog snatched it out of the air once and it flew just fine afterwards. If you you want a real RC copter look to pay more. If you want dabble in fun and frustration buy this simply because of the price. Then remember you get what you pay for."
2,Essentially Uncontrollable & Erratic,"My first heli suffered irreparable damage on its third flight, after a relatively minor ""crash"" landing. A critical plastic piece that drives the main rotor broke when the rotor hit a solid object while in flight. The heli was essentially impossible to control from the beginning, as it seems to have a mind of its own and frequently changes direction suddenly without any input from the controller! Thinking I may have a defective unit, I actually purchased another one, since it was so cheap. Alas, this heli flies exactly the same, with terrible control! I consider myself fairly adept at R/C toys, and feel that this particular brand/model is the cheapest for good reason -- it's very low quality! I've flown my nephew's AirHogs Havoc, which is MUCH more stable and predictable, and actually FUN.I can not recommend this heli, but would suggest paying a little extra for the AirHogs Havoc, to save yourself a lot of frustration."
1,Don't waste your money,Won't fly.. spins around in circles on the ground. Trying to adjust the trim is a waste of time
1,Got Broken after 2 minutes of playing... :(,"This is really disappointing , I bought this thing, 2 minutes after first trying it out, it stopped working, the parts are not flexible enough to take the falls i guess... its a shame...not recommended for newbies, only if you can make sure 100% you wont crush it even once :(I think you'll be able to find better helicopters that cost the same, problem with material itself too gentle."
1,reliability?,after about 5-8 launches it started too crash a lot it would go up about 100 fett then u would loose control of it and it would cras no regaining control after u lost it u decide..
1,Helicopter,"This was a cute gift that broke the first time it was used. It is very fragile and is not for children. I bought it for my husband. The recharge plug that goes to the plane broke the first time it was plugged in. After that, you couldn't charge the plane."
1,Don't waste your money,"The copter I received did not vary it's rotor speed. So, it was either full on until it hit the ceiling, or off and it would crash to the floor.Junk. Junk. Junk."
3,tiny helicopter,Its pretty cool to play with but it doesn't offer much control over. It also requires a lot of batteries that don't last very long. Its still fun though
4,Elaine,"I thought this was a really cool c.d. his lyric's speak for itself, But he could use some different beats cause some of the words could have gone with different music, I had the pleasure of seeing papa wiz t. in concert and he gave a wonderful show with a lot of energy, and his clarity with words was real cool he sounds just like his record but one thing i noticed that he only performed about 2-3 songs off this c.d. and the other material i never heard is he coming out with something new, also did he ever release anything before this one, also he needs to promote more etc."
4,Great characters - a fun read!,"The perfect romance for the summer. I loved getting to know Darby and Shane as well as the fairy godmothers. It was a blast. I disagree with a previous writer, concerned with minor details and would like to point out, it's fiction! This was definately worth reading and I can't wait for the ""Prince CHarming""."
2,Didn't Click with Me,"I'd give this book 2.5 stars if I could, but then I'd need to subtract one for the continual use of the words ""murmured"" and ""muttered"" -- it was all Darby seemed to be doing--- aside from Shane that is.I thought this book was a real silly story, but since I started on a plane, it helped me to sleep. An over-blown ""romance"" would be an apt description. I guess I'm just fed up with shallow, self-absorbed characters like Darby and Shane who do nothing but each other, and moan (mutter!) about how they just want to be HAPPY and FULFILLED with their LIFE CHOICES, despite the piles of cash the family has. Boo hoo.I agree with the other reviewer- when Interpol was thrown into the mix, I returned the book to the library. It was just, well, boring, and I found nothing compelling about the main charcters, the ""godmothers"" (I kept thinking Golden Girls) or the whole silly premise of the ""rules"" (darlings.)"
3,Snooze-ville with a dash of funny,"This book started of somewhat interesting, but then went into ""snooze-ville"". One third of the way through reading this book I almost gave up the task. It was slow and boring. Some characters are interesting; Shane, Darby, and the ladies of Glass Slipper, Inc. Other characters are very predictable and rather tiresome; Pepper and Bjornsen. The storyline FINALLY picked up in pace toward the last 2 chapters. I truly hope her other books are better."
4,loved it!,"This was the first Donna Kauffman novel I read and I loved it. Darby and Shane had very good chemistry along with amazingly witty lines. The Godmothers do play secondary parts and you really only explore their characters in ""Dear Prince Charming""Personally, I loved it. But I just recently read ""The Big Bad Woolf Tells All"" which was SO much better. But I absolutely adore the ending of ""Cinderella Rules""It does have quite a few adult scenes, so reader should not be under the age of 14 or 15."
2,Dissapointment,"After reading ""The Big Bad Wolf Tells All"" (which was amazing) I was expecting some great things from this book. Instead, I found novel with too much talking and sentimental feeling and some pretty sketchy reasons for various occurences.The characters spent a huge amount of time discussing with each other, repeating the same ideas and getting nowhere. The plot had dozens of holes in it and although the romance was good, there was just too much happening and it got swallowed up a little bit by the rest of the story.Read this if you want a lot of chatting and a bit of romance. Could be good if you were really bored."
1,"The story was flat, one-dimonsional--hardly ""novel"" worthy.","What more to say? Ok. The end was particularly disappointing, seeming to simply fall into the very ""void"" Amelie so often feels. ""The doorbell"" (obviously) rang"" for the La Baume as well as she beats a hasty retreat from providing her readers with any sense of real-life closure to the notion of an ""affair."" It was, in her words, ""a fright."""
5,Not Soft,"I really liked this book. It wasn't one of those soft, I-really-don't-know-what-you-mean erotic books. This one was lusty and full of it. Just what I was looking for. I recommend it highly."
3,Disappointing,I was reminded of Laura Nyro's work when she was inducted into the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. However her actual recordings are not as I remembered them. Again my error.
3,Rehashing Laura,"The release of this CD was completely unnecessary. Those aware of Laura Nyro already have her catalog or at least the ""Best Of"" collection. What we're missing is her ""Nested"" album, which is unavailable on CD. Thanks"
2,"Nice Try, But...","The CD arrived today and I must say I am disappointed. Though the sonics might be somewhat better than previous versions, it still has a flat, harsh, tinny, compressed sound. It's like am radio- OK for the car, but difficult to listen to on a decent audio system.This is all the more disappointing because Nyro was such a huge and original talent.I spend a lot of time listening to music. I have no problem paying a higher price if there is a commensurate increase in sound quality. Unfortunately, I don't think you are getting your money's worth with this disc."
4,if you are a Too $hort fan then you will love this,This video is intense. Its classic Too $hort when he is chilling at his own home. The videos that are shown are dope and if you are a true fan you will love it.
5,"Foster Brooks ""The Lovable Lush"" comedy video",Foster Brooks was a great stand-up comedian. My husband asked me to order this video for him and we both enjoyed it.
3,Completely Out of Date,Hooking into the latest banking systems isn't easy. It's still an awesome application and intuitive to use. Printing checks is so easy and tracking your personal finances is easy too.
5,Awesome game!,"This game seriously freaked me out. Controlling James takes a little getting used to, but Konami certainly makes up for it with the environment and storyline. If you like survival-horror games, this should definately be on your list!"
5,A dreadfully delightful experience!,"This was the first survival horror game that I actually really loved and I still feel affection to it. Maybe because of the somewhat likable/human characters, the wonderful fitting musical score, the iconic creatures such as the bubble head nurses or Mr.Pyramid Head, the intricate plot and that desolate foggy town.. that level of atention to detail plus that quality in chilling aesthetic is outstanding! I loved the fact that the creatures reflected a part of James's unconscious mind. Everything has a meaning and each one of your actions will determine wich of the 5(+1 included in greatest hits) endings you will experiment! I found out very nice the ""play as Maria"" option since that way you can sympathize a bit more with her, it is indeed a pity the short length of it.The ""silent fear"" factor is the catalyst that undoubtely makes the experience in Silent Hill dreadfully delightful!A must have!"
1,Bad game,I thought this was a bad game and i'm glad that they don't stock it anymore!that graphics were ok but bad gameplay and everything else.
4,Word of caution,"I'm giving this game four stars, only because it just seems so darned good. The only problem I've had with it is a big one - the fact that it refuses to run on my system despite downloading all the recommended patches. Small print reveals that it doesn't like certain Dell systems, although my particular Dell wasn't listed. I tried contacting the techs at the Konami help center via email giving enough system info and technical data to choke a horse. They replied quickly (1 week later) requesting more information (??), which I provided. I haven't heard back. In fact, I've emailed them again and have been completely ignored.This seems like such a wonderful gaming experience, it's just too bad it won't play on my system. I would strongly caution against ordering this game if you happen to own a Dell system."
2,Lots of walking around in dense atmosphere,"I realize mine is not a popular opinion, but I think the Silent Hill series is the weakest of the more popular survival horror games. I love all the Fatal Frame games, and most of the Clocktower and Resident Evil games, but something about Silent Hill, to me, was a promise unkept. It was rich in atmosphere and very little else. Quite a bit of pounding these mutant creatures to a pulp with a plank too. Sure, there are clues and inventory and you need to work out a story, but it all seemed so secondary to the ""chilly atmosphere"" generated, which eventually wore off. In my opinion it lacks substance."
2,Rough Edges,"This book could have been a real ""keeper"" if not for the editing problems. It leaves me wondering about the accuracy of the content. There are four diagrams within the first few chapters that have exactly the same caption. Only one is correct, the other three are clearly out of context.The use of a single highlight color (blue) is annoying. For a subject that is so dependent on color codes, full color illustrations are a must. This is one corner that should not have been cut."
2,Disappointing,"When I read that the songs had been remastered for this album, I was encouraged. SSFFTV was a poorly produced album, but the raw energy of the band and the catchy punk tunes more than made up for the deficiencies in the production booth.This release has tweaked the songs, but I actually like them less than on the original album.The original is worth getting though- Succulent Space Food for Teething Vampires."
1,"not worth the money, imo","My 10 year old received the Massively Mini Media Player for Christmas and she and I both are very disappointed in it. There is simply not enough memory and this product does not seem to be compatible with our Napster files (at least not readily. perhaps I could burn them to cd then rip them back to my computer and THEN transfer them to the mini media player but I have not tried that yet.) Folks, 128MB is a joke even for a young child. There are much better players out there in the same price range. I own the Sansa e250 which is a solid little mp3 player and I am seriously considering buying the same model for her as well."
2,Does not live up to expectations,"I wish there had been more reviews about this product before I bought it as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old son. Instructions are not helpful at all. Downloads are few to choose from and are not easy to complete. I would have saved my money and purchased an iPod Shuffle. Having a 1"" screen does not make this player worth buying."
2,Not enough memory,"I purchased this for my 8 year old for Christmas and thought I would be able to store more than just a few songs, but the memory capacity is actually only 109M and will actually only hold about 8-10 songs, no where near the 2 hours promised. I would not recommend this purhcase to any child."
4,Better than the reviews I've seen but very small memory. Got a few for 12 bucks each.,"Whoever is writing the comments about memory size are wrong about how nuch it holds. It WILL hold about 2 hours of music AT 128kbits and the sound isn't too bad using your own cutom eq setting. If yours isn't, you're converting improperly!. It works fine and has an fm tuner in it besides for holding pretty low quality video.I have 4 different types/brands of mp3 players and there is NO comparison between this and my 80gig ipod but that was 350. I got mine on ebay for 12 bucks new in box which can't be beat. Paying 60 at Walmart or anywhere else is way too much (as there are certainly many other units for that price that don't do video but have at least 512mb if not a gig).Look on Ebay folks! Pete"
4,Great gift for younger kids,"I thought this product was very unique. It's not as advanced as Ipods which, is great for younger kids. Although, the only thing I didn't like was that it was a bit too small."
1,big disappointment!,This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself. How they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me. Fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it.
4,Massively Mini,I bought this product for my 12 yr. old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it. For being so small the picture screen is very clear. For a child its nice but for me the screen is too little. Nice product at a reasonable price!
2,Questionable,"While I did not finish the entire book, I was very dissapointed with the author's narrow minded view of the artist as one who is completely dedicated to uncontrollable creative impulses. Not everyone is so resolute. Beginners and art dabblers would be discouraged. There is some extraneous common-sense advice, but not necessarily related to the creative process."
3,Not much there.,"The beautiful cinematography and qualify production doesn't really make up for a lack of action. When the credits rolled up, I was caught by suprise--the action hadn't really started yet."
3,aussie dreams,"ok, just not enough drama or connection between actors.even these type of films need chemistry between leading actors"
1,The Incomplete-Muddled Beatles lyrics,"I was pretty much born listening to the Beatles, I find I can sing along with almost every song the Beatles ever produced, I even own this book, why wouldn't I? I've had it for quite a while and every so often I decided to pull it out to double check the words to a song. I end up spending the next few minutes drawing arrows from one part to another, now they may have fixed this, but from the edition I have practically every song is out of order, and some are flat out missing lines. It'd be as if I just went and decided to write all the lyrics I could remember and not deciding to double check and not bothering to even listen to the songs.I just wonder what on earth happened and I hope they find the body of the editor someday, poor guy, died right before he could get to this... too bad he put it in the ""out"" pile.Oh, well, don't even think of buying it unless you like to draw arrows in books!"
2,maybe I got a lemon,"This desk seems to get great reviews, but when I got mine (after waiting a little over a month) it didn't have all of the holes drilled into it to correctly put it together. It was missing hardware, and once the desk was put together as best I could, it wobbled. It is spraypainted which was also disappointing. Maybe I got a lemon!"
1,Damaged or Refabed!,"Obvious this product was at one time returned by another buyer because the three main support arms underneath the desktop had stripped screw holes, someone apparently tried to glue the arms back on (evident in how the particle board ripped off the main surface onto the arms, where there should not be particle board) and lightly reinserted the screws to make it appear stable. However the glue must not have held well in transit as the support arms were off when I opened the package... and when I tried to screw them in (it's supposed to be screwed in to start with according to the instructions) it was evident the holes were stripped and the quick fix was glue... not sure if it was the work of a prior owner or the manufacturer."
2,Disappointed,Disappointed in the quality was not what I thought. A piece was off when I got this and the holes for the screws are missing on one of the legs. Legs are not in the right place.
3,smells great,"love this cologne by ck, it's one of my favorites of all the various fragrances he sells. great price too"
5,Justo lo que esperaba,"Un excelente perfume, el tiempo de entrega excelente, todo super bien, lo recominedo a cualquier persona que le gusten los CK"
5,Yoy really ESCAPE when you use this eau de toilette.,"I was looking for a fresh and daily parfume, but when I bought this I was followed beacuse the whole good feedbacks. It is really nice, for all occasions but certainly is better when you're dating, she's never know what is your scent. So I'm up to give this product a 5 stars.Also great Seller!"
4,Thought it had a sprayer,I've been a fan of Escape for a long time. This is just informative as to the fact that the .5 oz unit does NOT come with a sprayer at all. If the top gets left loose it will just run out if it gets tipped over or comes loose in a travel bag.
5,one of my husband's favorites,It was a good price for an old favorite - it's a pleasant fragrance that both my husband and I like.
5,Very satisfy with the product.,"I just purchase this item and I liked it... fast shipping, very good condition, good price and describes the item perfectly."
4,DONT LET RATINGS FOOL YOU,"I was in the store at EB games, just lookin for a decent war game for a good price. I saw Combat Task Force 121 on the shelf for 17$ and i read the back and it looked pretty good. I was told by a friend that it was terrible and was rated bad by xbox magazine, but i played multiplayer and training and everything, and this game is GREAT! DONT LET RATINGS FOOL YOU, THIS GAME IS AWESOME! OFFLINE TRAINING WITH BOTS, 4 PLAYERS ON ONE XBOX, XBOX LIVE, its a great game for a great price, dont hesitate to buy it. Good graphics, good blood, good weapon variety, good maps, overall AWESOME GAME!-Jeff Thiessen"
1,Don't buy this piece of junk,"It's clumsy, cumbersome, not great quality, and a bad idea. In addition to that, mine will no longer work after very limited use. Wish I could get my money back."
4,Good stereo sound -- built-in mike would help,"I exchange audio letters with friends, and this stereo recorder was purchased after my Sony 100 DVS died and no replacement parts were available. The sound quality is perfectly fine, though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high-end machine. It comes with a stereo microphone, but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit -- as it is, there is a long clip-on cord. This makes it tough to do ""off-the-cuff"" recording. Overall, a good value for the money. The other machine cost nearly $300."
5,What amazing interviews!,"How did they do it? Have you ever tried to get a one on one with a governor? What determination and excellent interviewing techniques! Fun ""government"" reading."
5,High Octane Trading,I just received my copy of High Octane Trading by Steve Wirrick. I just can't seem to put it down. I am already halfway into the book. I love Steve's clarity in explaining something complicated and making it easy to understand. His knowledge and experience in trading are helping me to understand how and what I must do to be successful in the Market. I can't wait to finish reading it and to start implementig his ideas and methology. Thank you Steve.
5,Great Advice,I read Steve's book and am looking forward to using his advice in my future trading. The way he explains investing in options makes it easy to understand. I recommend reading this book.
3,High Octane Trading,As usual Steve makes the art of chart reading and option trading 'simple is better' along with good money management an easy read. At the same time it provides a great insite into the markets mind. Worth it's weight in gold
5,High Octane Trading,"This is a ""must read"" book for serious traders. Steve Wirrick writes in a manner that is clear and concise. The novice trader as well as the seasoned trader will gain knowledge and insight from Steve's informative book! I recommend High Octane Trading to anyone who is remotley interested in trading stocks and options!"
5,Easy to read and understand.,Wirrick has taken a very complicated subject (options trading) and made it easy to understand. I have been trading options for over 10 years and read many books on the subject and this one is right at the top. I particularly like his discussions on taking emotions out of the trade and money management. These two areas have inflicted much pain and suffering to me and my trading account over the years. This book is worth every penny of its cost.
4,Good Intro,This is a very good introduction to trading. However for my experience and well-read people the book tends to be elementary.
4,Simple and easy to follow,This book is well written and easy to follow. There is no hi-tech jargon or exaggerated claims; just simple instructions with accompanying charts to explain the concepts. I have read the e-book twice and have a lot more confidence in reading charts. I have developed a trading plan as he suggested with clear cut entry and exit points. It is a great teaching tool and I am excited as I begin to see early success in my paper trading. This book was a great investment.
5,High Profits,I really enjoyed your book...You did a first rate job of taking a complex subject and making it understandabel and profitable
1,Fun with numbers!,"Since this book is all about statistics, here are some fun ones... The book has been out 4 months and was reviewed 27 times... Fascinatingly, 15 of those reviews came on October 30th & 31st and 13 or the 14 were 5 star reviews. (the other was a four star)... You dont think the ratings deck is stacked here do you? Hmm... Maybe, maybe not. If this guy could make as much money trading options CONSISTENTLY on a day in day out basis as he says, he would be a billionaire in short order. Why would he tell you? Think about it."
4,HIGH OCTANE TRADING,"received steve wirrick's book today. The information on using volume and moving averages has taken my trading to the next level. I now use volume to enter trades and moving averages to exit. Great book , i will read this book over and over."
1,SEE THE DATES OF THE REVIEWS,"If you look at the dates of the reviews you see clearly that they were made with the intention of giving this book the best rating. See for instance the reviews between Feb 07 and Feb 11 of 2004. It's amazing how many reviews appear in sequence - sometimes five a day - giving this book 5 stars. Short sentences that appear were written by the same person. Check yourself...That's why I always look at the ""most helpful reviews"", before buying a book. I certainly won't buy this one."
1,A vague lead-in to his other materials,"From the authors' website you can pay up to $595 or more for his course, or $129 a month for other materials. So what can you expect from a $29 book? I went through the first 100 pages in about a half-hour. The book takes the angle that you know absolutely nothing about trading. The trading strategies are worthwhile but elementary and nothing you can't find in most beginners books. Intermediate or experienced traders will be disappointed. The book deals very little with the mechanics of trading and is mostly a ""hopes and dreams"" lead-in to other courses or materials. The author may have more precise strategies, but you won't find them here."
2,High Octane Options a better name is Lame Options,"I have bought dozens of books on trading and options this is one of the most watered down, lame books I have read yet. If you want a good book on option strategies this one is the best I have read yet The Bible of Options Strategies: The Definitive Guide for Practical Trading Strategies by Guy Cohen"
5,Excellent!,Steve Wirrick expertly takes the difficulty out of trading options. He breaks it down so that trading options is based on a small amount of information instead of an overwhelming amount of indicators that can leave you paralyzed. I also like his advice about risk management and the importance of taking the emotions out of trading. That advice has been the most beneficial to me. Steve's teaching in this book (as well as seminars and chat sessions) is straight forward and very informative.
5,Great Information!,"Steve is a fantastic teacher! He has taken a very complex subject and made it clear and understandable. High Octane Trading and has improved my ability to read charts, recognize trends, and confirm the direction of a stock before trading. This book is a MUST READ for both novice and experienced traders."
5,soooooooooooooo good!,"All of her is one of my favorite cd's! Not only is it good music, but the artist is a genius...some like to call him the zen master! He does most of the instruments himself, and has a hypnotizing voice. I watched some of this cd being recorded..and it's well worth buying. I'm so happy to see you've made it this far Andy...keep making great music!"
4,Good Reading!!,"whenever you think you have figured out what is going to happen in this story...surprise...it doesn't work out that way. It is filled with action, lovestories, and suspense. Luke McCan is an everyday cowpoke whose life gets turn every which way as he tries to figure out his lot in life. As one meets McCan, his friends, and the love in his life, one can easily relate to the things that are happening to him. Once you have read Timbercreek, you MUST also read Fiddler and McCan. It is the second part of Luke McCan's story. I really enjoyed these two books and highly recommend them."
4,Great first book,"This was an exciting story and had good character development. The main character is Lydia (whose mother was killed when she was 15). She is now 30 and an crime author and crime consultant, having become famous on writing about the serial killer that killed her mother. Reviewing articles from the paper and TV, she sees another serial killer at work. The story line gets a little muddled in whether she is good or has some minor paranormal powers. She calls her long time freind Jeffrey (former FBI agent - now a private crime consulant) for help. Again the story is muddled with issues with him and her issues with the 15th annivery of her mothers death. All in all a great first book of a new author and well worth reading. I look forward to another story not so muddled."
2,Read a different book,"I eagerly anticipated reading this book as Lee Childs had recommended it and I really like his Jack Reacher novels. Unfortunately, the novel did not live up to its promise. The writing was stilted, the plot line old and stale and the protagonist was not only not sympathetic but she was also not believable.I'll stick with Lee Childs books as well as my Jean M. Dams cozy mysteries."
2,review of Angel Fire by Lisa Unger,"I have read Lisa Unger's last 3 books and enjoyed them all. I'd rate them 4 stars. But Angel Fire, which I believe is her first book, was only ""ok"". I found myself skipping pages in the early part of the book, then it improved considerably. To the point I found it extremely graphic and scary!! As the book reached the climax I could not read it and skipped to the end to see if it all worked out. This book has put me off thrillers for awhile, I need my sleep!!"
2,Poor Quality,"My wife and I were not impressed with the Caterpillar Tunnel. The material was flimsy and light weight. The tunnel is small and our children (even our 1-year-old) couldn't crawl through it without making the toy twist and roll over. Since it was not what we expected, we decided to return it and get our money back."
2,poor quality,"received this cute tunnel as a gift for my 9 month old son. he loves to crawl back and forth in it. he likes the one little section with see- through netting. but after a couple of weeks of gentle play and not folding/unfolding the tunnel, many of the seams are coming apart. very disappointing."
5,Indepth,"So much info in one place, and you can hold it in your hand. I just wish it was NKJV, but still outstanding"
3,"Good info, but no info about camping","This seems to be a pretty good book on all aspects of Yosemite, except that it doesn't give any information about camping."
2,Not for Beginners.,"The instructor is clearly a master of his work, however, until you're very familiar with the dance terminology and correct performance of key moves, you're not ready for this DVD."
3,Again...Not for Beginners!,"Like other previous reviews have said...definitely not for beginners. The dvd has 3 dance routines that are fun and energetic. I danced when I was younger for about a year and 15 years later I want to join an adult class. I thought this dvd would be good to teach me some basics and fun routines before I make a fool of myself at a dance studio. The breakdown of the dance is fast with little instruction and it is only repeated once before moving to the next 16 counts and if you aren't familiar with dance terminology then forget about it. For a beginner the instructor does not break it down enough to learn the steps correctly and on the right count. Also this is nearly impossible to do on carpet and make sure you have lots of space. I'm not totally writing these dances of yet, i'll revisit this dvd later once i have some technique under my belt."
5,The Cleanest Your Hair Will Ever Get,"This shampoo is amazing. I am African-American with relaxed hair and use a lot moisturizer, olive oil, and hair spray to keep my curls nice and in place. This shampoo removes all of the product build up and still leaves my hair really soft. I use it in conjunciton with Joico KPak cuticle sealer and reconstructor to make my hair strong, yet manageable. I also use another brand's deep conditioner and I would recommend everyone use a deep conditoner after using an intensive protein shampoo and reconstructor like the KPak line.Also, as was stated in the review below, you should probably only use the Chelating shampoo about once, maybe twice, a month. It really does strip everything from your hair."
5,I found it!!! I hope they never stop making this stuff!!,"We just recently moved from our house into a rental where we went from hard water to REALLY hard water. I didn't notice the difference in the water quality until after a few weeks of bathing in the new shower when my hair got inexplicably stiff, lifeless and dry. I went online to research explanations for the condition of my hair and found that hard water really builds up in your hair and the way to solve it is to use a chelating shampoo. I researched hair products that are chelating shampoos and chose the Joico because I trusted their brand (I've used their products before) and I was extremely pleased with the results. After only ONE shampoo the condition of my hair was vastly improved. It was unbelievably soft, smooth and shine. It was absolutely worth it to spend the extra money to buy this shampoo. My hair feels new again and looks gorgeous in spite of the very hard water."
1,FAKE PRODUCT! NO BARCODE ON BOTTLE!,"This was a bogus joico knock-off. Joico provides info on their website about companies who sell unauthorized bogus knock-off and what to look for: sticker barcodes instead of imprinted barcodes on the bottle (which this product had, splotchy labels, X thru barcodes or labels. I called customer service immediately for a return. It's better just to pay through an authorized Joico dealer to get the real stuff."
5,Excellent Product,"I've been using this product since I changed my relaxer (I used to use lye relaxers and now I use non-lye relaxers) as the new one leaves calcium deposits in your hair, after I relax my hair or when I want to add protein to it, I use this product and my hair feels so clean, so silkier and better, this product really helps your hair, my recommendation is to use a protein treatment afterwards like the Avlon Affirm Reconstructor, your hair will thank you...! :D"
2,Substandard quality wheel,"The company that provides these wheels are actually pretty decient, but the wheels themselves certainly don't do the job. These are replacement wheels for hand trucks, and they last MAYBE one week before they are no longer usable. The saying you get what you pay for definately pertains to these wheels."
5,Great Product,"Good product, exactly what the description stated. Will continue to buy this product for our future programs. Priced right for the product that you need."
1,Seems to be completely made up,"A classmate of mine at the University of Arizona is Apache, raised on the reservation. She has never heard of the Quero Apache, Tlish Diyan, Snake Clan, or anything else that this woman claims is true. She says that the snake is taboo, and the healing arts of the Apache are very sacred and secret, and they would never be shared with outsiders.I can't find any reference to the Quero Apache on the Internet that does not originate from this book. I think many people would believe anything if it seems to stem from ""Native American wisdom"" without actually doing any research. Shame on this author for making money by lying about Native American culture."
5,Insightful tales and personal connection,Maria recounts traditional tales passed down from her grandfather Ten Bears and helps us understand how the old stories relate to our experience of the world today. I have studied with Maria and know from personal experience that she is a powerful ceremonialist who brings together people from all spiritual paths into a deeper understanding of themselves and their connection to the Earth.
5,Maria's words are like arrows,"An elder of our people, the Apache, once said that Maria's words were like ""arrows that were shot into our hearts to awaken our souls."" Truely the memory and spirit of the Sierra Madre (Quero) Apache lives on in this book!"
5,good stuff and hard to find,"This is great for people on low-sodium diets. Cheaper to buy online and lots of times, you can't even find it on the supermarket shelf. I buy it for a friend who restricts her sodium intake. If you don't care about the sodium, it still tastes good with a wonderful cheese or slice of salami (which are not low in sodium!)."
1,Not worth your time & money,I have tried using this twice on my granite counter top and it simply will not penetrate the granite at all. And yes I have followed the instructions. Water marks are the same after as before use of the product.
3,Granite Sealer,I think the product is just okay. It was easy to use. When my counter tops were sealed before a few years ago it seem like they had a little more shine and I found that this product seem to leave the granite dull looking. Maybe its the cleaner that I am using but I am going to look for something else to see if it seals and shines.
1,Waste of money,"This product was a complete waste of money. I followed the directions and the granite was neither shiny nor did it feel smooth. My daily cleaner does a better job than this ""sealer"". The granite was dull and spotty after treatment."
5,Did the Job,"I followed the instructions and my counter top looks nice and bright, water beads up and dosen't sink in I know for an hour because I did a spot test for that long. Glad I got it, much better price than the stuff they sell at the DYI stores."
4,I like it,"This product was recommended to me by someone else and it appears to be a good product. I just applied it two weeks ago, so I'm continuing to watch the results...so far so good."
4,Jennifer Kries New Bodt Pilates III,I really like this workout but Jennifer moves too quickly from one pose to another and it's hard to follow her.
5,Lori A.,"This series/ instructor is wonderful. She is calm, statuesque, and patient - at the end of her workouts, you feel like you've worked oput with your best friend rather than having been pummelled by some hyperperky blond thing that makes you feel inferior no matter what you do. This series is perfect for all ability types because she is so good at explaining everything she does, and you can go at your own speed. I lost 12 lbs. the first 2 weeks and was amazed to find that one could sweat like a dog on the space of a mat..."
4,Advanced pilates,Good workout but you need to be an advanced level to enjoy it. I wish Jennifer Kries would explain less and do all the movement one after the other.
4,Good but wanted more...,"I bought this double pack because it was cheaper than buying either one title locally in Australia. Having watched both DVDs twice and utilising what I have learnt I have definitely improved in my playing - in fact using Chris Moneymaker's World Championship Poker computer simulation I have won just about every tournament!It is good to buy the double pack because he refers to certain chapters/themes in their respective companion dvds.However I was disappointed to find out ALL the extras on one DVD are duplicated on the other.Really there is probably enough room for probably all 4 DVDs in the series on 1 DVD - but he is obviously maximising his profit.Having said that, for a novice/amateur who wants to improve their game or become a professional this is a great start."
2,Too basic,"I love Phil Helmuth, but in typical vague poker instruction fashion, there was nothing new to learn from this product. Everything was basic and is contained in every other poker video and book out there."
2,really made for a poker dumby,This video was a big disappointment. I'm going to give it to my 8 year old niece.
3,I like Phil!,Pretty decent dvds. Was looking for the dvd but I seem to have lost it. Great for a beginner and held my interest more than the awful van patten dvds that I purchased. Phils personality really comes out in these.
5,Great,Exactly the book I needed. And for a very cheap price as well. Excellent condition. Just like new.I am very happy with my purchase
4,Better than I expected!,"I bought this as an after though when purchasing other Lincoln Center Jazz Orch. CDS. This arrived and I quickly put it in to listen to songs from the Jazz Masters. I couldn't stop listening to these amazing performances. They are all live from concerts dated on CD case. I teach Jazz in High School, and I can't wait to share this CD with my students."
5,A Masterpiece Of Electric Engineering,"If you have a philosophy about how life-inspiring musical sound should be and are looking for a device to convey it, do not look any further and get the Harman Kardon AVR 235 7.1-Channel Audio/Video Surround Receiver. This receiver is truly an aesthetic and harmonious achivement that with its increbible sound will indeed make you wax poetic. Combine it with the JBL Northridge E30 2-Way 6"" bookshelf speakers and on the road you are to decipher the mysterious and delicious spirit of your musical preference."
5,Awesome,"A Must buy.Solution to locking the volume control to AVR - from the manual is on the section called ""Volume Punch-Through"" Page 36."
4,hot hammond man,"Lonnie Smith just seems to be able to ignite the Hammond B3 organ like nobody else. Larry Goldings comes close as does Joey DeFrancisco, but Dr. Lonnie is THE MAN! I really loved his older Blue Note recordings as well as his last release: TOO DAMN HOT, and this new one comes in a close second. Great grooves and quite a few jazz based tracks as well. A bit more low key than Too Damn Hot but STILL HOT!!!"
2,Poor Effort,"This is not a good product for someone as talented as Dr. Smith. Poor arrangements and uninspired playing.Saving the CD somewhat are the tunes Trouble Man,Willow Weep For Me and Freedom Jazz Dance."
2,A Triumph - One of his Finest !,"High water mark in Braxtonia one of his classics, showcases some of Braxton's major big band compositions complex, ambitious and swinging like craaaazyy. Man can write ! Also a straight orchestral march and some more abstract pieces, Line up reads like a who's who of 70's contemporary jazz all great names. If there 's only one AB you have room for this is a good one as any. Agree with reviewer below all the 4tet stuff on Arista plus this one needs REISSUE ! listening rec company ?"
5,great alternate for Harry Potter addicts,"I have just finished the Journey of the Last Prohet. Although the title is a little misleading it was a very good read. I found it to be a young persons' view of the fight in all of us of good and evil and how love can blind you, family bind you, and fantasy release you from every day life. A must for anyone over ten years old."
4,Good stuff,"This is a consistently interesting and enjoyable disc for fans of freeish jazz. ""Escape from Beigeland"" is especially good, and ""Shenandoah"" makes a welcome appearance to balance the abstraction. Recommended."
4,Brewer at her best,"I've had the album for years and finally picked up the cd of this live performance. For those of you not in the know, Brewer segued from the pop to the jazz world many years ago and worked with some of the top names, including Basie and Fatha Hines. This cd gives the listener an excellent opportunity to hear Brewer uninhibited by the studio--and it sounds like she had a blast!"
1,a widely-used but poorly-written textbook,"This textbook covers a lot of material, but in an unsystematic way: the definitions are not worded in a predictable and consistent manner, the more important issues are not given priority over the less important ones, but everything is simply thrown together into an indigestible and boring glob."
1,"No structure, hard to understand, not a good textbook.","This must have been one of the worst textbooks i have read so far.The biggest weakness is that there is little structure within the chapters.The authors jump from one topic to the next and introduce new concepts where they are totally unnecessary and out of context. This makes the book hard to read and understand.Example: The authors talk shortly about the definition of the ""biopsychosocial"" approach and then introduce studies and their findings relating to new concepts such as ""fatalism"", ""self-efficacy"" or ""social-support"".Likewise they proceed throughout the book they start at point A and arrive at point XYZ.Another point I dont like are the really artificial and forced transitions from one topic to another."
5,This is my first top end speaker,I play very clean Blues and Jazz with a Silverface Twin Reverb and I get a consistently beautiful sound at low and high volumes.This is a great speaker.
5,goo's a beat doctor,"i, love this one,up tempo beats,raw hip hop -jazz-funk fusion. all the expressions of today rythms and grooves at it's best . highly recommended."
4,Sony 1 GB Memory Card,Easy to use. Had no problems with it. Inserted it into the camera and worked right away
5,Sony 1gig Stick Pro Duo for PSP,"this is a gift for my younger brother. I will say it works great and its quick considering the size it can hold up (a gig). Great product, Great Pricing, Great seller (go Amazon)Rey"
1,Bad product and sellor incommunicado,My Dell PC would not recognize the Sony memory stick with the adaptor I bought. My PC recognizes all other cards. I contacted the sellor by e-mail twice and I never received a reply. Bad product and sellor ignores my e-mails
5,I love it!,I'm glad that I found this because it kept me from having to buy a brand new digital camera. I works just like another memory stick and you can switch different memory sizes in and out. I would highly recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to convert.
1,card slides out of adapter.,I have a SanDisk memory stick duo and adapter that work great but the sony version I was not satisfied with at all. The card slides out of the adapter easily and both the card and adapter overall seem flimsy.
4,Satisfied,"so far no problems of anykind. i bought it a month ago. I havent lost any data. transfer rate is alright, I think its a bout the same as transfering from HD to HD."
4,normal,Don't need to write a review for a memory stick card.Good for waht I need it for at a good price.
5,Pro Duo Media Stick,The price was great! The Duo Stick works fine. The only thing that I would suggest is adding a protective case to store the stick in when you are not using it.
5,The reviews say it all.,"Just bought this tiny beauty for my PSP and it's awesome. If you just bought a PSP and wondering what memory card to get to replace that 32 MB joke they give you, this is the card for you.Might as well go with this 1GB card because it's just more cost efficiant. The others are just as pricy. I have tons of songs on my PSP now. Only problem with the PSP is that it doesn't play MPEG 3 movie clips only MPEG 4 but look around the internet and there are programs to convert your MPEG clips. Plus tons of room for pictures to customize your background.I love watching video clips and listening to MP3's and don't forget the great games on the PSP. Great memory card with lots of room. Don't hesitate, buy it now. (unless you want to fork out the cash for a 2GB stick ;-)"
4,Tons of room,The Sony 1 GB Memory Stick has tons of room for all my photos. It makes it great when you're on a vacation and you don't have to worry if you have enough room for anything more. You do pay a little more though for the Sony brand than you would a chip with another manuf.
3,"Good memory stick, bad adapter","The memory stick works fine, as advertised, but the adapter did not work. After speaking with their customer service I was told they would pass the issue on to warranty, but I never heard back. So, basically, watch out if you have any issues with the product. You may be stuck with it if it's bad."
2,Didnt Need it,I didnt need this for the camera that i bought but i read a review about it that highly recommended getting it. Waste of my money.
2,Review of Sony 1 GB Memory Stick PRO Duo Media (MSXM1GST),"Product took forever to arrive and the adapter did not come in retail packaging. have not tried it out, but I""m assuming it will work without any issues. if it does, back it goes!"
5,Sony memory stick - great tech,The delivery is prompt and the product is new and in good quality. It is really easy to install and use. No fuss and no pain. I love it.
5,Good Memory,"Again I got this memory for my dad's Sony Cybershot. And didn't had any problems with false Stick Duo or anything, some of my friends had this kind of problems before. It geives enough space for my dad to take a lot of pics with his new camera."
4,Expensive for what you get!,I will not purchase another Sony camera. The memory stick is twice the price of a SD or DX card.
1,BE CAREFUL,I have just bought this item whitch in supposed it includes the Memory Stick adapter in witch Amazon places its picture and the sellers does not inlcudes it.
2,Acadian translation,"The book that I received was in English. I wanted the French edition. I did not like the book becauseI wanted to review the Acadian language and the book was a translation in English, so it lost theculture of these French people."
4,A great history of Crown Point Press,"If you are familiar with Crown Point Press, this book offers some of the printmaking highlights over the past 35 years. My favorite section is on the 1980's where CPP used skilled japanese printmakers to create some of the most challenging woodblock prints I have ever seen. The lucky artists that were invited to publish works during this time period include: Chuck Close, Wayne Thiebaud, and William t. Wiley."
3,aromatherapy belt,works pretty well & stays warm for almost an hour - it's a pain to heat in the microwave since the belt attachments are sewn onto it. make sure you flip it halfway through (i heat it :55 one side & :55 the other side)
3,Where are you dixie chicks,Fans of dixie chicks may like it but it is a pity that there is no music and songs by dixie chicks.
2,Not from England,I bought a set recently and unfortunatley it is made in china. We have some older ones and they are much different
2,Questionable Quality,"I was going to buy this Old Country Roses Tea Set (for my niece) in Sydney, but decided to save some money and buy via Amazon. In Sydney retailers stock a made in Indonesia version of the product. The product received via Amazon was a made in Bangladesh version, which is considerably inferior. Biggest imperfection I noticed was with the gold leaf. Quality control and consistency is obviously now a big problem for Royal Doulton. Returning the item from Sydney is too hard. I'm less inclined to order from an overseas retailer in future."
5,Royal Albert Old Country Roses,"I've always wanted something - anything - in this pattern and the very affordable price for this 3-piece set enabled me to finally get my wish. My only regret is that it is no longer made in England. The set is made in Indonesia, is very beautiful, and it has the nice look and feel of fine porcelain. The packaging within its original box was excellent, even including a mesh protector over the spout of the teapot. However, for shipping, the original box was placed inside another larger box with only crumpled paper as a buffer. I think styrofoam in some form would have been superior, especially for a product of this caliber. I could feel the original box sliding in the larger box. All in all, the teapot, creamer and sugar is fantastic and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend ordering this set to anyone who wants one."
4,pond plants,"Very complete source, but extensive use of latin names made it somewhat difficult to use."
5,"Detailed, documented and well written. The Best RV Book.","Schnabel takes a complex and hidden history and lays it out in a very readable fashion. Great journalism is about the detail under the surface as well as the stories behind the leading characters. I found this book gave me a good balance of detail and drama. I come away ""knowing"" the characters and a bit of their motivations.I've read many, many books on RV and OBEs(Swann, Moorehouse, Brown, Monroe, Atwater, Sinclair, etc.). This was by far the most detailed, well-researched and well-documented. If you're interested in RV, this is definitely the book to start with.I disagree with some of the previous reviews about Schnabel's agenda. I perceive no agenda here. It seems quite well balanced.Summary: a fascinating subject treated with diligence and delivered well by a very good writer. If there were a sequel, I'd buy it."
2,"More CIA trash, highly endorsed by the author's father.","A real piece of work! Schnabel doesn't try to discredit remote viewing, in fact, he probably provides what you'd belive is one of the most comprehensive accountings of the work. In keeping with true CIA MO's he attacks, misquotes, and even ""fabricates"" & ""creates"" interviews with various authorities and officers in the book. Half of those he quotes, except for those who promote his book, were never interviewed--they were simply spied upon. This is a real piece of junk work by a lieing worm--spend your money on a hamburger and fries."
2,Boring!,"This book reads like a 60 minutes news story stretched to 10 days. It's reads like this..""John x astounded the skeptics by going into a trance and sketching a diagram, when Mike B heard about it, he took it one further by claiming to read the mind of the target, John x was not please and took it further by...""And it goes on like that. Whether the writer wanted to state the facts or provide an interesting read is unclear. This is more like a dull military brief. Read Moorehouses book instead. At least its more interesting. I lost interest in the subject after reading this book.Try again please."
1,More CIA misinformation by a former CIA employee,"Jim Schnabel is a member of the CIA's strategic writing staff. He has no books published in the US except for this one. His others never made it out of the UK (as they should not have).... It is indeed factual, however, most of the interviews never occured--they were simply constructed from slivers of information and bits of phone conversations. He makes ""tongue-in-cheek"" references to former members of the remote viewing unit, portraying them in anything but a flattering light. Be cautious about this book--those who recommend it come from and are still part of the intelligence community. Be careful"
3,Informative and A Good Read,"This is a good book for the reader interested in an introduction to the U. S. Army's Remote Viewing program. It is information, comprehensive and balanced, offering no judgements but documenting the often controversial history of the government's foray into psychic spying."
2,Not so definitive after all!,"I agree with the reviewer below about Mr. Adam and his sleezy book, and the even sleezier way in which he promotes it... whom does he think he is kidding? But, Schnabel is nothing more than a government writer who adjusts the facts to meet his expected outcome, or should I say to meet the outcome he is directed to meet. There is truth here, but it isn't the entire truth, and he fabricated interviews, statements, dates and times to carve himself a book. There is no science writer here, just another government employee who accomplished his mission, with your tax dollars."
4,hybrid device is pretty good,REally mellow and musical. Tracks blur together simply because they are so hypnotic. I suggest this purchase for calming your chi!
2,It Didn't Work Out,Sometimes an album just disappoints. This reviewer likes the Boxcar and his unique sound but this album fails to make the cut. Perhaps the problem is that these (mostly) traditional tracks have been done better elsewhere. This listener would like to give the hardworking Boxcar a higher rating but a faithful reviewer has to call them as he sees them.
4,vey satified,got my order right on time and it was in the condition that the sellar said it was very pleased.
2,"Super cheap, not as dressy as I'd hoped","This is a fun casual necklace...not quite what I was looking for.I thought the beads were stranded on silver (or at least metal), not cotton twine. Tough to tell from the picture, and I can't recall that it was stated in the product description."
1,Way too tight. More of a choker.,This necklace looks like is hangs on the model in the picture. When I got it it was so tight I felt like I was being strangled. I am severely allergic to metals so I can't make an extender out of wire so I don't know how to let it out a few inches so I don't feel like I am being choked. It is very pretty and I got it b/c I can't wear tradtional necklaces beause of a nickel and metal alloy neckalce.
2,"Pretty pictures, but...","Take the text with a huge grain of salt. It says nothing original about the Japanese aesthetic (terms like ""elegant"", ""minimal"" and ""harmony with nature"" abound); it contradicts itself on a few key points (is the half-height tea-house door for guests, or the host?); and in one caption it identifies a Go board as a ""game of mah-jong"". Oops."
5,Great Inspiration,Book has many different design themes all with first rate photography to inspire anyone considering a remodel or who just has an appreciation of Japanese architecture.
3,Quite good,It is a good book but I would have liked to see more samples of houses to have a more complete overview of how the Japanese architecture has evolved over the years.
2,Expected so much more,"First of the seller was fantastic, it was a smooth experience. The only problem is the product.When you hear Just My Size, you think great plus size fashion at a responsible price in this case it falls completely short.The bra looks nice but the design is lacking. There is the awkward Madonna cone bra syndrome that just won't go away. The main issue however is the mission impossible of the bra-I've tried and tried but it rolls up constantly. It doesn't matter how I arrange the straps or anything else it just won't stay down. I really expected more especially from Just My Size. In the future I will just spend a little more and get a bra that isn't a daily battle."
4,Comfortable,For me it is difficult to find a comfortable bra and I found this one to be just right for me. Gives me support without wires and comfort. It shipped as promised and came in perfect condition
3,Narrow Straps,"I bought this for my wife she complained that the straps could be wider in order to fit more comfortably. If you prefer narrow straps then this is for you. If not, think before buying."
2,Get the facts,"Having successfully used a similar product on a sports car int the 60's, I ordered a superskin in spite of reading several of the negative reviews it has received. The big problem with Superskins is that the manufacturer produces them in different sizes, but Amazon either doesn't understand this or is just confused by it. Although I thought I had ordered a large cover for my new pick-up, I received one that was too small to use. Only order this product for vehicles with steering wheels 15"" or less in diameter and with a small grip diameter. Also, the leather is not ""fine leather"" as advertised, but fair for the price."
5,A must for the young reader in your life.,"Kids (and adults!) will love this book. Schafer knows her stuff--it's a great journey through a historical landscape, with plenty of romance and adventure. A great gift. A gem."
5,excellent retelling of a beautiful story,A potentially dreary three-and-a-half hour train ride whizzed by thanks to The King's Sister -- an excellent retelling of one of my all-time favorite stories -- King Arthur and the Roundtable. Seeing the story thru the eyes of King Arthur's sister afforded a different and excellent perspective to view the events unfold. The book moves so smoothly -- thanks to graceful writing and pacing. Bravo. I look forward to the sequel.
5,Great Little Helper,From the Experienced Cooks to the Novice ones this is a great handy chopper for everyone---highly recommed this item
2,Ennobling Ambiguity,"Obtuse, ill-concieved, and at times poorly organized, this book was the bane of my undergraduate Medieval EuropeClass... I found it to have little value in understanding the cult of ennobled love in Medieval Europe. Few times did I actually garner new insight about the subject, and to make matters worse, I not only had to write a paper on it, I also was not fortunate enough to purhase it on Amazon.com I bought at my campus bookstore and I ended up paying more for it."
4,Fits the Bill,"I had some trouble fitting the batteries in the compartment, but I won't now that I learned the trick. Otherwise, it's easy to operate, lightweight, and has good sound quality for the price."
5,Beautiful,This is the quality that you would expect from any other Oneida flatware. I have had this for about a year and it is still in great condition. The kids feel like such grown ups eating at the formal table with their very on silverware. Great product
5,"Real, Beautiful Flatware","This flatware will set a beautiful table for your child. The silver is not shiny and polished, but flat and muted in color. My family preferred this design to the Chateau set. This set of real flatware will last a life-time, and be something a child will grow up to hand down to their children."
2,"Overpriced, Please go to Ikea if there is one around.","Way overpriced, and bends very easily. I found Ikea silverware to be of a better quality for ultra low price. (Yes, It really fares worse than Ikea)"
3,Very Nice but Small,"I purchased these for my four year old daughter, and while they were very nice and well made I found them to be too small for her. She is pretty good using adult size silverware, but I thought she would like her own special set because she just recently got some Dora silverware. These were even smaller than the Dora ones. I found some that were similar quality but bigger at IKEA and returned these. I'd recommend them for a younger child."
1,Price is too high,"I purchased an Oneida youth set from the Oneida website (fork, spoon & knife) for approximately $13.00 and am very pleased with it."
2,not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with this kids' spoon/knife/fork set. The quality is not good -- the weight of each utensil is light and they tarnished after one wash in the dishwasher. I do, however, like the style and size. All in all, I would not pay so much for a set like this one again. I bought the Trebimbi set and that one is a lot better in terms of quality for the price."
4,Nicely Made But Wish They Were Bigger,Many years ago (in the early to middle 70's) when saving Betty Crocker coupons you could get good silverware cheaply. I ordered a child's set of cutlery that was sized for 6-9 year olds that included a knife that could really cut. I have been looking for that size in the recent years and can not find anything. This set will work well up to perhaps 6 years. My granddaughter will be turning 5 shortly and loves the size of them and they aren't babyish. However she does struggle using the knife to cut. I did buy two sets for the grandkids but wish they were just an inch longer.
3,"If you watched Project Greenlight, this is great","Under normal circumstances, one would not think much of this movie. It's a nice coming-of-age story about a 17-year-old boy (wonderfully played by Shia LaBeouf), but there's nothing spectacular about it. His relationships with his parents and his potential love interests are not fully developed, and the viewer doesn't necessarily buy into what they try to tell us. It's been done before, and it's been done better.But, if you watched the Project Greenlight series on HBO, it's a must-see. It's fun to see how all the scenes turned out. The much-debated group hug no longer exists--if it did, you'd walk out of the theater or turn of the TV. A big thank you to producer Chris Moore for getting rid of that.All in all, it's a ""Sunday Afternoon Movie"". It's the kind of movie you watch on a Sunday afternoon when it's raining outside and all you want to do is sit on the recliner and eat popcorn while someone tells you a story for an hour or so."
4,"Funny, Entertaining...and Short","This is a well written, entertaining film from the Project Greenlight series. Kelly is beautifully acted by young Shia LaBleuf (his performance is worth watching the movie alone). Shaker Heights follows 17-year old Kelly has he progresses from rebellious smart alleck to a caring adolescent. Kelly's off the cuff remarks are humorous throughout as he often ""says whatever enters his mind"". Kelly befriends Bart through their mutual interest in war reenactments. Bart's sister Taddy quickly becomes Kelly's object of affection. Kelly's attempts at courting Taddy are also often humorous.Shaker Heights clocks in at under 80 minutes. I recommend that this is time well spent."
3,Nice movie,"BoSH is a nice movie. It's a growing up movie, with great acting. As far as the dvd is concerned, I was hoping for a making of featurette."
3,Real,"This movie is pretty real comparatively to other movie involving teens, despite the war reenacting. It's no wonder Shia LaBeouf is going to be a Super-Star A-lister."
2,How could people like this movie?,"I was reading reviews for this movie and noticed that people thought this had potential to be a great film and some complimented it. I loved the series (PGL2) that went with this movie but like the first season of the show I couldn't figure out why they chose the script and directors they chose. This seemed like a bad choice for a script and how could anyone choose Kyle and Efrem(sic?) after seeing that amazing crucifix film by contestant Joe Otting? Throughout the first two seasons I couldn't understand the final decisions made by Chris, Matt, Ben and the others. I loved project greenlight but I can't see how anyone would actually think this movie is any good at all."
3,second Project Greenlight winner,"This is the second film distributed by the fine folks at Project Greenlight, and it is a coming-of-age film about Kelly Ernswiler, an angsty, intelligent, picked-on high school senior played very well by Shia LaBeouf, Other actors are fine though Erica Beeney's script seems to have suffered in the process of making the film, and the direction is unimaginative though competent. There are some terrific moments and characters, but ultimately has nothing new to contribute to this well-worn genre."
4,A Perry Mason Classic,"The Case of the Spurious Spinster is yet another marvolous Perry Mason novel by Erle Stanley Gardner. When Susan Fisher finds herself in the middle of a office scandle, and all the fingers are pointing at her, Perry Mason is called. This is a fast pace thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you reading. If you like the television show,the book is even better."
5,Prismatic pieces of superb melodic sounds!,"Michael Garrison's second album (1981) is just as catchy as his first (In the Regions of Sunreturn - 1979). For anyone not familiar with his music, MG is kind of like Tangerine Dream when Peter Baumann was part of the group, and Jean Michel Jarre, only with more upbeat melodies. Lots of strings and soaring sequences with ample melodic beats. Highlights of the album include the first track, Eruption, which builds up to a toe-tapping melodic piece that melds into your mind and uplifts then warps into track two, Interphase. Discovery (track three) and Sequencing Blue (track five) are quite cheerful and reminiscent of JMJ circa Oxygene and Equinox. Tracks five through seven (Sequencing Blue, Melt Down and Pre Dawn Flight) are all interconnected with no significant breaks much like how JMJ techniques his stuff. The rest of this album are quite similar to pieces on the first LP, nice but not differnt enough to be memorable."
4,Midway through and really psyched!,"I recently discovered this author and his line of books. I read The Automatic Millionaire book and started making changes right away. And this was only a week or so ago. Then I saw this new one was coming out and so I picked it up on Tuesday. I'm midway through and am really excited about the prospect of becoming a homeowner. It's so ""adult like"" but it doesn't seem as hard as I imagined. Bach made me feel really comfortable with what I need to do to make it happen.Looking forward to finishing it and hopefully owning a home soon! Great book so far."
2,ok for renters,but that's it. I was really disappointed. I think he's just trying to keep his name out there with this one. NOTHING at all new.
1,Want to lose your home and your savings? Buy this book.,"Shame on David Bach for releasing this book at the very peak of the housing bubble. (Actually, he released it about 9 months past the peak.) With this book David Bach is giving people advice that would normally be good advice, but because of his poor timing it may actually get people into financial trouble. Get the original ""Automatic Millionaire"" instead."
2,May be Good Information for a First Time HomeBuyer,"I read David Bach's other book called Smart Couple's Finish Rich and Loved it. I was pretty disappointed with this one. It had very repetitive information in it compared to his past books. It was very simplistic and I think it would be good for someone who has never purchased a home before. My husband and I are on house number 3 between the 2 of us and are experienced with investment property, so this book was too elementary for us. Might be a good read for a first time home buyer with little experience in real estate."
2,"rush job, devoid of discriminating content","I've read some of the author's other books. This is, by far, his worst.Among the many flaws of this book:- lack of anecdotes: perhaps because the author lacks much experience in real estate- superficiality: there are few checklists and thorough descriptions of pros and cons- redundant material from the author's other books- mediocre writing: book reads like a rush job- simplicity: he makes real estate investing sound like something you can just snap your fingers and do quickly- dangerous advice: he encourages risky interest only and other loans without any mention of large risks and foreclosure.I recommend that you save your money and skip this title.Instead, I recommend the following real estate books which I have read and grown from:- Real Estate Investing for Dummies by Tyson and Griswold- Home Buying for Dummies by Tyson and Brown- John Reed's real estate books (those of general interest)- Buy and Hold Real Estate Strategy by Schumacher and Bucy"
3,"good for a first-time homebuyer, but not for a wanna-be landlord","Three things concerned me. First, as most other reviewers pointed out, much of the info could be gleaned from the other books. Like grade school math, half the year (book) was spent reviewing what was done the previous year (book). Second, the author tried to say that markets vary across the nation, yet all his examples were San Francisco or New York with multi-hundred-thousand-dollar apprecations in a couple years or less. That doesn't happen in the rural Midwest. Third, I was hoping for more info on being a landlord, specifically, passing on the day-to-day management to a management company. Also, cash-out refinancing means new closing costs, which we know is not typically cheap. I don't think the author emphasized that."
5,Outdoor parties in 113 degree weather are now enjoyable,"This things works good, sometimes to good. The cool mist air that is blown from this high quality fan is very nice. Covers an area about 15-20 away and about a good half circle area. Having adjustable speed for fan is a must and easy to change with it's big control knob. Don't hesitate, better than all the other, heavy, sturdy and worth the money. I've owned mine for a couple years now and need to replace one of the hoses, my fault. My Honda lawnmower ate part of it in the tall spring grass a couple weeks ago. Parts are easily replaced from the Big box home stores."
1,RainX Weatherbeater wiper blades WORST EVER!!!,"Bought a pair of the RainX Weatherbeater 28"" and am stuck now 3 1/2 weeks later buying different ones due to the WORST performance ever in slight snow or freezing rain they are like magnets to ice build up. The defroster can not keep up with the amount of ice these smear across the windshield and what they do clear on one pass they smear right back over on the return stroke. I have had many wiper blades and never have I had such a poor performing blade. Even in straight rain they chatter and streak. Buy something better since these are sure to disappoint you."
5,Old School,"Wow...I have tried for the longest time to get a Hector Lavoe CD. It's the best. It's the music I grew up with being from Bronx, NY. I Love IT!"
4,Good book for CCNP Routing Exam,"Just passed the 640-503 exam using this book as my last reference/prep. Also helpful were Doyle's Routing TCP/IP Vol I and Huitema's Routing in the Internet. Also of interest is the Hutnik CCIE Lab Study guide, which has useful configs for testing in a lab environment.Coverage of routing protocols, VLSM, Redistribution was excellent. Very good use of diagrams and examples to illustrate. Probably the best Exam Prep style book I've read to date, in terms of matching exam requirements.Gave it 4 stars due to existence of editorial errors - you should pick them up easily if you know yer stuff. I didn't see a www link for errata. Overall, and after the fact, I'd recommend this book as a single point of reference for studying for and passing 640-503 to anyone experienced with Cisco routing protocols."
1,"and besides being full of mistakes, the CD didn't work","Useless, So many mistakes it isn't even funny."
1,"littered with mistakes, awkward and clumsy writing",215 pages through this text I finally abandoned it. I have a half dozen different books on the new CCNP routing and this was the third one I've read. I have enough background in cisco to recognize some of the flagrant errors in this book. I decided that it would be better to stop reading it lest there were mistakes I wasn't catching. OSPF and BGP are complicated enough with out getting bad information and disjoint writing. It also spent an inordinate amount of time in the early chapters going over basic CCNA level material.
2,Too many errors,"Although I did pass the exam on the first try, I would not recommend this book. I used the old ACRC book from Cisco press along with experience. There are just too many errors in this book and it does not cover the exam material enough."
5,Increible!!!,"El album completo es para no dejar de bailar y morir de cansancio. Este viene dividido en dos partes. La primera es el 1er. album de Mike Theodore Orchestra: ""Cosmic Wind"", incluye las versiones originales y completas de este clasico de 1977. La 2da. parte se trata de ""High On A Mad Mountain"" de 1979. Estoy totalmente convencido que ""High..."" es un disco mucho mas solido que el antecesor y su sonido mas poderoso en todos los aspectos, la instrumentacion y las vocales son mis aspectos favoritos.No puedo creer que haya existido tanta perfeccion en el album de 1979, es un verdadero clasico de la disco y la remasterizacion es estremecedora.COSMIC WIND (1977)1. Belly Boggie (6.27)2. The Bull (6.35)3. Cosmic Wind (7.00)4. Moon Trek (5.04)5. Ain't Nothing To It (6.04)6. Brazilian Lullaby (6.04)7. I Love The Way You Move (4.17)HIGH ON MAD MOUNTAIN (1979)8. High On Mad Mountain (8.11)9. Wonder Man (7.50)10. Disco People (7.30)11. Dragons Of Midnight (8.19)"
4,Much better than we think,"Both of these records are classics, but I have a real soft spot for the ""Cosmic Wind"" album. While ""Mad Mountain"" has tracks that are harder, ""The Bull"" and ""I Love The Way You Move"" are totally cool and absolutely essential. Former Motown player Dennis Coffey and Theodore himself but together a duo of great albums here, and we're lucky that the notoriously out of touch Westbound label actually allowed them to get reissued. The Tom Moulton mix on Cosmic doubles the price of admission, and are an absolute must for anyone who loves the Salsoul sound with a different twist.."
3,Better than Hawthorne Heights,"It's hard to believe that ""a day in the life"" actually used to be HH. ""Nine Reasons To Say Goodbye"" actually sounds alot more like an early New Found Glory recording (circa nothing gold can stay). It's really different from HH, but thats a good thing, cuz' HH is nothing to write home about anyway."
2,not so good,the book was falling apart. The binding wasn't strong.The book itself wasn't what it advertised to be. I was looking for something that didn't require a lot of reading ( for a student with low reading skills)
5,Tlking With Your Hands,"As a former dancer, I now do Liturgical Signing with choirs. The words are often hard to find that are used with the movements and singing and this book was perfect.Sharlene Kessler"
5,Very helpful!,"This is my only sign language book and I have never had any sign language classes. So this book is very helpful, both in terms of excellent photos that show signs from two different angles plus a nice text description that includes helpful ways to remember the sign. I would recommend this book. The seller was prompt and sold the book as described."
4,Great Book,"This book is great for anyone wanting to learn ASL, and it is very clear and the descriptions are very helpful as far as aiding memorization."
4,Favorite part: the memory bridges to help visualize & remember signs,"I like the way that the signs are grouped in chapters. They are signs that belong together... the organization makes good sense. However, it is more of Sign language dictionary than a text book, with the exception of the first 10 pages of introduction. I'd love to see a book with the signs grouped like this one, that also included the kind of lessons found in the book ""A Basic Course in American Sign Language"" by Humphries, Padden and O'Rourke. My favorite feature of this book are the tips to help you visualize & remember each sign. Each sign has not only pictures, but text that include: Handshape, Position, Movement, & Visualize."
1,Horribly Illustrated. Many Wrong Signs.,"Read: 1/13Rate: 1/51/13: A little bit of my background before I review the book: I am deaf, and I have many years of experience using ASL; hence, I know what I am talking about. My hearing friend showed me a book entitled Talking With Your Hands, Listening With Your Eyes. Upon a cursory glance through the book, I find numerous of errors. A lot of times, the pictures of the signs aren't what they are perceived to be. There are several intermediary steps missing. And for some of the others, they are dead wrong. Like people will say, ""a picture says a thousand of words."" No amount of description for every sign in the book will fully explain it; only watching a person signing a word says it all. Beginner signers ought to take a look at Elaine Costello'sSigning: How To Speak With YOur Handsand then find an experienced deaf signer for further reinforcement. And everybody else, they can just laugh at Talking With Your Hands, Listening With Your Eyes and discard it."
4,"Excellent sequel to ""The Probability Broach""","Detective Win Bear returns in this much-more-SFish sequel to _The_Probability_Broach_ by the same author. More than anything else, this novel gives you an opportunity to see, at the human level, what the author thinks might have led to the anarchistic North American Confederacy of the earlier novel."
5,Sounds Great,"Installed this system on a 2005 F150 with 40,000 miles on it. Had the dealer do the install, they had no problems, and it wasn't very expensive. The system fit perfectly, sounds fantastic, aggressive under acceleration but is very nice on the highway, doesnt' drone or intrude when you are just driving along. Really nice sound when you first start it up in the morning, it really announces that the truck is ready to roll."
4,Decent unit,"I purchased this for use in the streets of London. Normally, I have a pretty good sense of direction, but I don't think there is a single street in London that goes straight for more than 2 blocks. This unit was able to get and hold a signal in most locations, but not all. Apparently buildings can completely block the signal. On the plus side, the unit is different that pictured and very sleek with built in rubber on the bottom so it stay where put. Battery life was no issue. It fit in my pocket with no problem and I had no difficulty pairing it to my iPac. The software was generally helpful with lots of useful points of interest, but I had trouble getting it to show the street names rather than the UK route numbers. When you are walking it is more helpful to know where Oxford St is that the A-14. Overall I would recommend this for people wanting a versatile unit with general Europe countries maps. It does work in the US too, you just need to purchase separate software maps."
5,very pleased,I knew what I needed and I found it on Amazon at a fair price it was sent to me as promised and it arrived as promised I was satisfied with the transaction.
4,Review,"It's a perfect travel keyboard.Overall it's a sub-par cheap keyboard. The sounds are low quality the action on the keys makes it difficult to play. It's not accurate enough to use as a control keyboard for sequencing on a laptop. If not for the portability I would give this a 2 out of 5 stars.The saving point is it rolls up to the size of a shoe and easily fits in a suitcase. I recommend this product for a travel keyboard to play on the road and hotel rooms. If you can, wait a few generations for the technology to mature."
2,"Convenient and portable, but I question its durability and quality","The roll up keyboard certainly is convenient because it is portable. Great for the apartment dweller or anyone who is tight on space.The sound quality of the piano is below average as it has a tin like sound. Also the keys on rare occasions produce a different pitch or sound than it should. And sometimes, while playing the keyboard it will stop completely, however simply turning it off and back on will resolve the issue. All of the above makes me question its durability in the long-term.Finally, this is OK as a beginner piano to see if your kid has interest or if you are like me, a singer and just need to pluck out notes to learn songs. If you are already a proficient keyboardist, this product may not be for you."
4,Costume got some good laughs,"My son saw someone dressed up as a whoopie cushion last Halloween and said he wanted to be one this year. I was hoping he'd forget, but he brought it up this fall. I couldn't find one locally, but I located the costume on-line. Like most costumes, it is cheaply made but served its purpose. The costume was a hit at the school party and during trick-or-treating. Several people got a good laugh from it."
5,A pretty good story.,"I am an American Indian woman, too. This is a story that made me laugh and cry alot. I knew Myra. She was my sister, my cousin, my aunt. She had some problems, but she was a strong person, and sometimes I felt like she was right there telling me why she did some of the stuff she did. But I already knew why she did. You might get mad at her, then you just want her to be okay. And I really cried alot for the ghost in the rainbow."
2,"Too much Country, Not enough Rock 'n Roll (2 1/2 stars)","I bought this album after I read a stellar review in the Boston Globe. I was dissappointed. Although a sincere musician, Todd Thibaud is essentially a country music artist. The review made it sound like it was a rock/pop album...And I'm not crazy about country music."
3,Don't Let the Funny Stuff Get Away by Jeanne Robertson,I was disappointed that I overpaid for a book that had been discounted to $7.50 (the discount sticker was on the book that I paid full price for). Never again!
5,BETTER THAN BOSE WAVE RADIO,"I CANT BELIEVE HOW WELL AND REAL THIS SMALL BOX SOUNDS. EVEN IN OPEN SPACES LIKE PORCHES AND TERRACES. THE FM RECEPTION IS OUTSTANDING. THIS IS THE BEST RADIO I HAVE EVER HEARD BY FAR (YES, INCLUDING THE BOSE WAVE RADIO)."
5,Trivoli Portable AM/FM Radio,It is perfect...it was for an elderly gentleman who can just listen to it right by his chair. Simple functions and good sound make it the ideal radio for him. The recharging is simple and there are no batteries to replace all the time. I looked a long time for a radio like this.
3,What If?,"I would like to admit that it is a good book as far as the real story goes. However, at times reader gets confuse, as there is little explanation about the things. Domestic violence is going on every where, therefore it is nice to read that how vicitims really feel. This book could be a lesson for other women in the same situation. I like the book because it teaches me several aspect of Muslim culture which I was not fimiliar with. This book opens a wider, rather cruel side of her society and religion.over all a book worth getting it."
4,what if? by A.P. Moore,"""What if?"" is an autobiography of a Muslim woman. I love the book as this was the first time I read a story by some one who was an insider to this society we don't know much about. I like the book as it is a very compelling true story of a young girl and her courage, I would recomend this book to any woman who needs to be free from her violent partner."
5,A Religious experience.,"Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard make up the most powerful, and moving musical ensemble I have ever seen. This movie catches a moment at the pinnacle of their time together. Lisa Gerrard's vocal presence has an almost angelic quality and Brendan Perry's artistry with lyrics is unsurpassed. I particularly enjoyed the parts when one of them did a song of their own and the other watch completely enraptured. This kind of reverance for each other's music is why Dead Can Dance made the kind of music that has no boundaries or limits. The interviews between songs were enlightening and a pleasure to observe. Lisa Gerrard has an endearing quality and a unique outlook on their music, and I remain impressed with Brendan Perry's aura of wisdom as he practically glows with musical energy. I highly recommend this movie to any and all DCD fans as well as beginners because I think it gives a good cross-section of the many, many styles that DCD has mastered over the years."
4,Unique,"Excellent for DCD fans, this DVD illustrates how unique this band is. If you've heard the CD it's quite an eye-opener how to see how the amazing labyrinth of sound is produced. Quality not the ultimate but camera work pretty good. A must-see."
5,I think this group has incredible talent. Pick your mood.,"This group has incredible talent, I find myself listening to Dead Can Dance more in the fall. Pick your mood and this music fits it!!! I was fortunate to see them in concert and I would give anything to see them again. One word discribes them and that is ""Beautiful"""
3,"Excellent live footage, but continuity...","I found the concert footage excellent, but between almost every other song is interview footage which reduces the intimate feel and impact of the live show. It may have been better had the interview footage been placed at the end of the concert footage."
3,DCD on DVD....eventually!,"Finally the Towards The Within concert video is available on DVD without having to buy the 3x CD, 1x DVD set.This DVD contains 14 live tracks plus 5 promotional videos.Sadly, the picture quality is WORSE than the VHS copy I got years ago. Its very grainy, with lots of digital artifacts and noise. The promotional videos included as extras also suffer from low quality transfers. No digital restoration or new mastering from original negative here folks.The disc comes in one of those ultra-slim transparent DVD cases like the ones used for the Love & Rockets and Nephilim DVD releases.But wait!!! ...the one I recieved says PAL REGION 0 on the back. PAL???? Dont we use NTSC around here?I checked the DCD web site, and confirmed this is a PAL only release. Weeee. Seems to work on my JVC player though. Aspect looks ok. Hrmmm. I dunno. Go figure."
4,Fast Forward over the interviews and enjoy the music.,"Unlike most concert films, this movie does not open with footage of the band. It opens with a montage of groups of Non-Western people dancing while DCD plays in the background. For most groups, this would come off as the height of pretentiousness, but here it works. The big pay off is the concert footage. Lisa Gerrard's voice was in great shape on the nights that they filmed this. The entire concert turns on two songs - ""The wind that shakes the barley"" & ""I am stretched at your grave and will lie here forever."" The only minus would be the interviews with Lisa & Brendan Perry that are dropped in between every three or for songs. But, hey, that why the remote has a button with FF on it. By the way, this film looks GREAT on a wide screen TV, so if you've got a friend with one, drop by with this tape & a six pack."
4,Finally we get to SEE them!,"It's true the sound quality is dissapointing, hence only 4 stars. Why on Earth produce a DVD of the most profound musical act ever without making the sound as good as a cd? So we must forgive that and listen beyond the poor quality barrier. We are nevertheless thrilled to have bought it, and it is them, and they are as wonderfull to watch as they are to hear. There are interviews with Brendan and Lisa between songs that give insight into the songs and themselves. Brendan's brother is in there, and a really wild drummer! It's powerfull and poinient stuff. It would also make a great introduction to the band. Maybe one day they'll redo the sound. Don't worry about the PAL rating, it's an all regions DVD, which is clever. The Protagonist video is also very nice."
5,Good,"A few years ago I bought the first volume in the manga series. Basically, when I bought this I expected it to be an anime form of the manga but was slightly disappointed. The manga and anime are a lot diffrent, with diffrences in storyline, and characters mostly, but both are great. The anime series is funny, but still has a good plot, and some good action scenes, even if it wasn't much like the manga series, however diffrent they are in story."
3,Kind of silly.,"This show is kind of silly so far. I may give it a chance, but it was a little boring. If I can find the next volumes for cheap, I may spring. Too many other shows I would rather see though right now."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Gatekeepers is a title I have been waiting for a while to see, and I have mixed feelings on the first DVD. While visually it's very pleasing, with a massive budget having been put into this show, the first disc has not taken any steps in creating likable characters. In fact, the whole cast seems to be just rehashed stereotypes I've seen before. While the plot is more original, and I appreciate that, it's also, to frank, quite cheesy. After seeing the first three episodes only, it would be wrong to write the whole series off as tripe, but I can see where it could be going...In the end, this is essentially an anime for young children, and even with that in mind, it's still disappointing. I won't take of the third star after seeing only 1 disc, but if it doesn't improve, 2 stars is what I feel this series deserves. Anime fans, I would save your money for something a little more sophisticated."
5,Nice addition....,"I've had this for a while & never really listened to it. I don't know why cause Chaka does not disappoint. However, if you're not a fan of the classics & can't appreciate them, this CD isn't for you. But if you are, then it's an extra plus to have the classics sung by a classic. Ms. Kahn blows the lid off these songs as only she can. And the orchestra is an extra boost. I'm glad to own it. It's nice to have on in the background while working."
4,the greatest,Chaka is awesome! You can truly see why she is so wonderful a singer. She belts out these classics like a person from that era. A little bit of money for a lot of entertainment.
4,Truly a Treasure,"Chaka Khan has really arrived. It's sometimes easy to sing popular music. The true test of a singer is if they are able to handle ""classic"" music. Chaka proved herself over and over again in this collection."
5,MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have been waiting a long time for this to happen. I have been a big fan of CKs from the start. Her voice then and now has always moved me. When I first heard her sing I knew that she had something special. Back in the 90s she sang Afie on a talk show that Dionne Warwick was on and she blew me away. I was hoping that Afie was on this disk. Anyway this CD is a fine testament to the vocal talents of Chaka Khan. From beginning to end I love ClassiKhan. To Sir With Love and the 2 007 tracks are the best. I believe that 'I Believe' has Grammy written all over it. So if you are a fan of hers this is a must have.
4,Love the CD,"There was a little mix up with the shipping, but the seller was very helpful once he learned of the problem. I just love the CD, and would buy from the seller again. Thanks"
5,amazing all around,"I was leary at first, strings and Chaka? But wow, her voice is stellar. Her phrasing and interpretations of these songs are fresh and inspiring. The arrangements are fantastic, classy yet fresh. The recording sound is out of this world. Beautiful album!"
2,The Thrill Is Gone!,"This is just my subjective opinion... I think this collectionof tunes by one of my favorite artists is just ok. It's notnot something that I want to hear more than once in a blue moon.It would have been better had she just done an album only halffull of standards- and then added some fresh new material toround it out. Her voice is raspier than i've heard it, but shedoes add a unique interpretive twist to these old standards. Ifyou like jazz sung by r & b ladies, be sure and check out ReginaBelle's ""Lazy Afternoon"" cd."
5,Talent as big as all outdoors!,"A brave, be true to yourself album from one of the most interesting singers working today. After a brilliant funk workout on Prince's label, this CD finds Khan reworking some jazz standards, some film themes and one original composition and taking full possession of each one. Bold enough to record signature songs by the likes of Patsy Cline (""Crazy""), Lulu (""To Sir With Love"") and Shirley Bassey (""Diamonds Are Forever"" and ""Goldfinger""), Khan excells at each one. ""Hazel's Hips"" alone is worth the price of this disc. If you want wonderful interpretations of standards by a bold and striking singer, ""ClassiKhan"" is for you! Don't ever stop, Chaka. You're the greatest!"
4,timeless voice!!,"i've been listening to chaka since the 70's and i always knew that she could and would be the voice to bring back vocal jazz greatness...her voice has the style, the scat, reminding me of the days of dinah washington, ella, and sarah. This is a refreshing cd..music that we just don't hear these days...does chaka seem as if she's going through the motions as some reviewers have mentioned? No, not at all, this cd is a different genre, that chaka illuminiates...she sings standards, which she has the versatility and voice power to carry. However,i wish she could have incorporated more jazz standards into her reportoire, which would be a five star rating. Buy this cd (if you want something unique and timeless) and you will not be disappointed!"
2,Hit&Miss,"back in the day I always Chaka Khan but I never really dug Her Solo Albums all the way through. dug Her Singles which have showcased Her Versatility over the years. this Album doesn't really best suit Her. the thing with Chaka is that maybe 2-3 standards on a album is cool,but anything past 5 songs is asking a bit too much. the material here doesn't fit her for a whole Project. Her voice is cool,but the Song choices don't highlight Her fully."
4,"Mr Alexander, Full of Bull - Pucky","In Response to the ignorant speech put out by Jason Alexander, it would help to get your facts straight and learn a bit about music.First, Chaka was with Rufus probably before you were born and was a star then, is a star now. Second, Ashanti is a CHAKA wanna be, not the other way around. (Chaka would have to lower her talent significantly) Three: While Chaka has hit after hit, over an extended period of time, (three decades) , Ashanti is at best a one hit wonder who needs a hit without Ja Rule.Mr. Alexander should put down his bong to see that the only reason why the Ashanti Album blew it out of the water was to avoid the stench of your review.Its a shame since these are two excellent artists of differing eras and ""reviewers"" must profile everything just to be cool.\Check out ""Diamonds Are Forever"". This is a great mellow CD down in fine style by a significant song stylist. If You liked the Rod Stewarts and Robert Palmer CDS, you will like this one."
3,Bad debut,"Collection of two separate novels, being what it is, Coetzee's first published book, shouldn't stand high in your exceptations. Author himself hasn't yet built his narrative style which often lead to confusing storytelling, often misleading reader and leving him on not-so-firm-ground of bad litterature. When I say bad i mean that it is involuntarilly bad (and what, you can say, was written bad in ones own will?), though I must confess, Vietnamese project is intelectually provoking, but lacks well developd charater with justified action. You shouldn't start with Coetzee on this book"
1,"get the hook, scrape this guy off...","Some of the absolute worst, most pretentious, emptiest, and most ultimately worthless drivel I have ever read. Jorge Luis Borges, regardless of all the idolatry that's been heaped upon him, had a surprising number of misses, and maybe nothing much to say. But I'll grant that he had a few high spots. Not this guy. Very derivative and disappointing stuff...I'll go elsewhere for literary thrills."
3,Bollywood Noir,"Film noir has been attempted before in Indian films. MOst of the films from Ram Gopal Verma and Sriram Raghavan are noirish. Ek Chaalis Ki Last Local, Sankat City are examples of well made noir films. Utt Patang tries hard to be as good as these films but fails because the characters are not believable and the director misses the point. Utt Patang works only because tis film is sustained by a fine performance by Viany Shukla but writing fails to provide props for this fine act.Vinay Shukla is in the midst of a emotional crisis, his girelfriend is about to break up with him, he meets a stranger on a blind date and somehow gets embrioled in a dangerous cat and mouse game with a french- obsessed gangster also played by Vinay Shukla.Passable, three stars."
5,The poems that touched my heart,"T.S. Clarke had three poems that really touched me.""Lost at Birth""...lets young girls know that some actions will create a re-action. Sometimes bad things can be fixed by a Higher Power.""Belated Thank You""....made me take time to remember my father. I realized that he was the first man in my life. We shared many good times and loving moments. I still miss him.""Face Value""...Reminds all the ladies that there are still some good men out there."
1,"Consistently Bad, Short Burn","These candles burn very quickly and in an uneven, lopsided pattern. When I contacted the company a year ago, they blamed it on the container I was using, which was wider than the usual votive containers. They did not offer to replace the costly votives that lasted less than 2 hours. I recently tried burning the remaining votives in a more traditional container that conformed to their shape and, again, they burned quickly and in an uneven pattern, sometimes with a large flame, to the point that I had to remove them from the table after about an hour because watching them carefully was getting in the way of entertaining. The flames on these candles are scary to observe. Also, there is not even a hint of a honey scent when they burn. Will never buy from this company again, especially considering the poor customer service. I've had excellent experience with General Wax beeswax candles and will buy from them in the future."
4,IT WAS EXCELLENT,THIS CD WAS EXCELLENT IT HAD GREAT ARTIST ON ITA AND IT HAD SOME GOOD RIDDIMS. MY MONEY WAS WELL SPENT. I AM HAPPY
1,Good but incomplete,"Probably a decent real-mode reference, but VERY tied to MASM (pretty much ignored the existence of other assemblers) to the point that it implies that MASM directives are actually 386 directives.Oh, and it DOES NOT COVER PROTECTED MODE AT ALL!"
2,It's pretty much ok,"The book is not terrible. However, it is not very organized. The author is evidently very knowledgeable in the field. The problem with this book is that it does not clearly explain the concepts that it introduces. This book is meant to be an introduction to assembly language, but it is not really so. I don't think the author clearly explains the theory. I have worked with much better written books than this one. This book should be used as reference, if anything, rathen than as a guide or text book for an introductory course in assembly. Also, another important point to make is that there are several mistakes throughtout the book. I don't really recommend this book but I still chose to give it 2 stars because it does contain useful information."
2,"Can be used only as reference, not for learning.","It is obvious that the book is very poorly organized, I haven't seen worse. And looks that it is done deliberately, to confuse the reader from the beginning to the end. The book is not for beginners, and can be used mostly as reference. I wonder why colleges continue to use it as learning material - don't they have any choice? I'm very much afraid to fail the class with that text."
1,a poorly explained book,"I use this book in fall 2000. I find out the many examples in the textbook are very simple and are not very useful. Secondly, the explanation for the basic concept is pretty hard to understand. It does't use the simple diagram to show the mapping of memory, which will make life much easier. I have suggested my teacher using other assembly books instead of this book."
2,windows only,"this parochial book only covers assembly programming under microsoft windows.if you use linux and the gnu tools, the book will not be very useful."
1,Horrible book,This book should be used as an example of how not to write text books. The index is very poor to the point of not being usable. In order to find anything in the book you have to skim every page in the chapter you think something should be in. The examples and text have little to do with the problems presented at the end of each chapter.
3,Good intro material but not in depth,This is good intro to assembly language. It's good that there is an emphasis in 32bit protected. You won't be coding 16bit unless you're writing BIOS code or working on embedded systems.The 32bit protected mode was not in enough depth. There was little talk of GDT/LDT/IDT and call gates and no discussion of ringzero code.If you've never coded any assembly then its a good book. Something else to look at would be Art of Assembly Language. It is now has its own version for 32bit. Search google.
4,Pretty Good!,"This is the first time that I am learning Assembly language programming and this book proved to be a very helpful tutorial. Concepts are taught in an easy manner, and if you have good experience with high-level languages such as C++,JAVA cracking assembly should be almost a piece of cake(just kidding!). The book has a nice ASCII table on the back and the apendix also features DOS interrupts and Intel instructions. I think it is a pretty good book overall."
1,Not a very organized book,"I am in the process of taking assembly language programming now. We are using this book and I find it very confusing and very hard to follow. The author jumps from one thing to the next often referring to things taught in future chapters. It is hard to write programs because you are not sure where to look for help. I hope that if you are looking for a book to learn assembly language, that you will please choose another one."
3,No deep emphasis on 32bit protected mode programming,"Kip Irvines', third edition was a masterclass. The way he presented the book was excellent. But much to my disappointment, the fourth edition is much the same as the third one. There are only tid bits of info added on 32bit programming (which we already find in most of the assembly language books), rest are much the same as the old edition. I'd have been happy if he had included detailed explanations on GDT's,LDT's,Call gates,writing stand alone protected mode programs,etc with examples, atleast in this fourth edition. Anyway even if the author wishes to bring out a new edition emphasizing on these topics would be a waste of time, as the era of 32bit computing is coming to an end and the itanium architecture will take over soon. I suggest that the author bring out his next edition with a deep emphasis on IA64 system programming topics."
1,Does NOT Make The Grade,"I have recently completed a university course in Assembly Language programming. The instructor opted to use this book as the text for the course. First, the book is riddled with typos that are serious errors which can confuse a student into a state of mindless frustration. I would like to write a lengthy review, but for the sake of brevity, I can tell all in the few words that follow. In short, I shelved the book during the duration of the course and read ""Peter Norton's Assembly Language Guide."" I received a 4.0 (A) in the course which others who continued using the Irvine book struggled to make a passing mark. If all the errors are corrected in the text, this might be a worthwhile reference, but as it stands, it's more damaging than helpful. No offense intended for the author, just a bit of constructive criticism."
3,Get the book for the Assembler,"I have to agree with James L. Johnson in that this book has many mistakes, and would recommend ""Peter Norton's Guide to Assembly Language for the PC"". Although the price is a bit steep for an assembler, it might be worth getting as this is the only book that comes with a so-called free assembler.One more reason why this book is not worth getting, is that you have to use the Author's own library files to get some examples working which is not a way to learn Assembly. I must say if you do not want to spend any money on learning assembly language. check out the author's webpage, he has some great links to Assembly Language Tutorials and Resources."
1,RepairMaster Warranty,"I purchased 3 DeLonghi air conditioners from J&R Music, along with Repair Master Warranties. When on of the a/c's broke down I called RepairMaster - an arduous, frustrating process - and they said they had no service providers in my area. I live in Manhattan, NYC, and if they have no affiliated service providers here then they do not have them anywhere. They wanted me to call around and find someone to repair the Delonghi ac and have that person join their network of service providers so that I could get my ac repaired under their warranty. This is a worthless warranty. They will take your money and then do nothing. Which brings us to J&R Music, the sellers of this worthless product. When I called them to complain about RepairMaster I was informed by a customer service rep that all they did was sell the RepairMaster warranty they took no further responsibility for it. J&R is complicit in this fraud."
1,HORRIBLE- worthless!,Was on Hold for literally over 2 hours over several days before even got to talk to anyone about a repair! THEN they told me I'd have to send it away someplace. THEN probably NOT covered anyway AND would charge me $95 if it was not covered! They took my $$ easily BUT made it HARD to get ANY benefit!
1,SCAM DON'T BUY,"They make the repair so difficult that you won't use the warranty. ie They want me to remove the 45"" tv from the wall, pack it up, and send it to them to repair, whereupon if they decide it is a warranty issue they will fix and send it back to you, whenever, for you to re-mount on your wall. They say if they find it is not a warranty issue you will then be billed whenever they decide to charge you. I've read other reviews and I'm finding they don't take responsibility for very many repairs. I am a 60 year old lady who is not a weight lifter! DON'T BUY THIS WARRANTY"
4,MEDIEVAL ESPIONAGE,"This is another installment in the Chaucer pilgrim tales. This is the tale told by the Lawyer. The Lawyer tells a tale of Nicholas Chirke who is hired by the Sheriff to find out who killed a man named Berisford and save the man named Fromlich who is being framed for the killing.This tale was at first confusing with the amount of names being thrown about, but that subsided and it became a wonderful story full of greed, espionage, mystery, wanton women and of course murder. Not only is it a good tale, but you get to go back in time and dwell for a while in 14th century England. Enjoy your stay."
4,well designed plot,i like medievil mysteries and i read this in one day so obviously i liked it.The story is told by a pilgrim-which is awkward- but the plot is intricate and believable.You will be puzzled until the last chapter when it all makes sense.Good detail on the lives of medievil lawyers and how they had to grub for clients.Not one of the best historical novels i have read but i very much enjoyed it.
3,"Good Unit, but False Advertising","I have been happy with this unit, although I do not use it for much else than playing DVDs. One thing that really disappointed me is that the online literature promotes two features that this unit does not have. The first feature is ""Paralle Video Output"". This feature allows the DVD player to drive the Component Video and S-Video at the same time. My unit has a tiny switch in the back that I have to toggle all of the time. The other feature is ""Bookmark"". This feature is promoted as useful for demonstrating to friends. Well, the player does not have a 'Bookmark' feature, but it does have 'Marker Search'. Marker Search is useless for demonstration because the markers are cleared when the unit powers down and the unit powers down automatically after some time. I called Toshiba on this and their response was ""All design specifications and dimensions are tentative and subject to change."""
1,Buyer Beware,"I bought this product when Amazon was offering a special back in Nov. About 45 days later, it began skipping tracks on DVD playback. At first, it wasn't so bad, maybe one track on a two hour DVD. A week later, it wouldn't play at all. So much for being able to watch some fun DVD's over the holidays! Took it to the shop at the end of December (since beyond the 30 day window for return at Amazon). Upshot, it's still there and is expected to be there another ""couple of weeks"" since the part to be replaced (the laser) is on ""backorder"". I'm guessing it's because so many of the ones that were DOA from Amazon are now being refurbished!If you do buy this unit, make sure you play the heck out of it during your ""30 day"" Amazon window!"
1,"Good price, but died quickly","I bought this DVD player because of the super-low price. But, alas, better to have expensive and functional than [inexpensive] and dead. This player lasted--lemme check--25 minutes. It froze in the middle of a movie then simply refused to read any DVD after that..."
1,What a waste!!!,"Player lasted from December '02 until October '03. Worked great for awhile, but now it makes grinding sounds and ""Disk Error"" appears on the display. No discs are lodged in the player and after reading some of these other reviews I'm throwing in the towel. While Toshiba in my eyes is a good name, spend a little extra and get a better quality product."
1,Was good while it lasted,"As many other reviews have noted, mine too had defective parts. When I first got the player it worked fine. Now, the tray won't close and the disc's will not get picked up and placed in the actual player. I'm now in the process of buying a new one. I don't even want to think about how much it would cost to repair it."
1,died during playback,"Unfortunately, I have to reiterate what another reviewer's experience was. I placed a disk in, it played it for an hour or so and it seemed to be working well. Suddenly, the picture froze and that was it. It would neither play that disk again nor any other. I will call Toshiba and ask for an explanation and, armed with that information, I will decide whether I will seek a refund and shop for a different player or whether I will request a replacement to give this dvd player another try."
1,Don't Do It!!!,"I bought this garabagio last month as a present for my Mom & dad. I read the other reviews saying that there were problems with it, but figured the law of averages would work in my favor, with me getting a good unit.......NOT!!!The player played once and never again. The disc got ""lost"" inside the player, over and over again.....no matter what disc we tried.This type of stuff NEVER happens to me...I always have success with an otherwise bad product...but not this one. Leave it right where you see it....just don't but it.Now I have to go through sending it back and choosing another!"
4,Beautiful Picture,"Really beautiful picture and pretty easy to set up. Lots of nice features. I bought a Monster Cable S-Video cable to go with it, and it makes a great difference. However, I can't get the volume control on my TV to respond, either using the controls on the TV or with the TV remote, during dvd playback. Any suggestions would be appreciated."
4,Not Perfect,"I have used one since December. I am generally happy with its performance. There is however one defect with the player. It does not handle subtitles correctly for some disks. I would have subtitles off during playback, and suddenly the subtitles get turned on. The two disks that caused this problem to occur are one of ""Blue Seed"" disks and ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)"". Since I got this player cheap, I can live with this defect. Also, since this is probably a firmware issue, this may be fixed by now. Good luck."
1,Player Dies 6 Days out of Warranty,"I was enticed by the excellant price Amazon was offering on this unit, but quickly determined that it's operations were awkward and more than slow - it's not just slow because it's trying to change between discs, it will not make the logical step of skipping a disc without first loading and reading every disc between where you started and where you want to go. It also failed to notice discs that you would add when the drawer was open unless you first shut the unit on and off.The unfortunate part of this, is that the unit ""logically"" died last night - the motor turns, but there's nobody home - it doesn't recognize any discs and it opens it's drawer at power on or power off and tries to read the discs while the door is open. ..."
5,Another winner from Toshiba,"Great unit for the money. The changer area offers loading of multiple discs even while the unit is playing. It also allows for random play when loaded with 5 CDs..This is nice. The unit has component video outputs so you can totally utilize your televisions picture quality. If you are into Audio/Video, the unit has the following features and all have been flawless thus far for me. DVD-Video, CD/VideoCD/MP3/DVD-R/CD-R and CD-RW."
2,DVD/Audio CD ok but MP3 playback is bad,"Hi,I just bought this DVD player last week and I was too excited to recieve my package. It didn't take me much time to hook the device to my TV and it was fully functional within 10 minutes. I started testing it with DVD and it ran fine (obviously). Then I switched to Audio CD, but unfortunately, it gave me 'disc error'. I insterted another Audio CD and it ran fine. Then I tested it with MP3 CD and it performed horribly. It stops at every MP3 song. Rarely played 2-3 songs from the list. So then I went through the manual for MP3 guidelines. It has so many limitations that I am totally disappointed by this player. Seriously advise buyers to first check its performance at best buy or circuit city and then decide.."
4,"A good DVD, a good MP3 player","I installed the SD2805 last night and dashed back to my computer to burn a 147-song CD to test the MP3 player part of the equipment. The results were very good. Not only is this piece of equipment able to deliver excellent DVD playing and functionality, but it does very well when playing well recorded MP3. If the MP3 quality is avergare you will be satisfied. If the original quality (bit rate) is high, you very well may be astonished. Highly remmended for the price and value."
3,Great value but lacks,"Great DVD player but falls short with mp3 and cd playback and features. Slow to read cd audio and not much options with mp3 menu. If one of your main reasons for buying this player is mp3 go with a panasonic, much better. Pnasonic has no skips when skipping or searching audio."
4,Great Budget DVD - Carousel Player with poor MP3 functionali,"I can't complain about a five disc carousel player ..., but I do hope that future models manage to improve on transition time between discs and that they improve MP3 title selection - the unit only displays the first 10 or 11 characters of the MP3 title, and if you should have labeled your tracks by artist first, you're not going to have a clue which song is which if the artist is the same. You might think that a logical track order would help in this capacity, but sadly it doesn't appear to be the case - I couldn't tell you how it determines track order from within a given music folder."
4,great value ...,"A GREAT VALUE...! ONLY DRAWBACKS ARE LACK OF DIRECT DISC SELECTION (IE. YOU CAN'T JUST ENTER ""DISC 3""; YOU MUST USE THE DISC SKIP BUTTON REPEATEDLY UNTIL YOU GET TO THE DESIRED DISC); ALSO THE REMOTE CONTROL IS NOT ARRANGED CONVENIENTLY...THE BUTTONS ARE TOO SMALL AND CROWDED. STILL, NO REGRETS HERE! BUY 2 !"
1,A skunk of a machine,We bought this particular machine because of Toshiba's good reputation and the great price for the features. Picture is fine but the discs do not want to stay in their appropriate trays! When you start the machine the tray automatically rotates to scan how many discs are present. Very frequently a disc will become dislodged and at least once every 3-4 weeks it get dislodged enough to be flung to the back of the machine! We then have to take the cover off to retrieve it and hope it isn't scratched (which has happened!) We've taken it in for service and they could find nothing wrong. Wrote to Toshiba - no reply. I'm going to be wary of buying Toshiba in the future and will NEVER buy a multi-disc DVD from them again.
2,How could they design this without random play for MP3?,"THe biggest drawback of this product for me is the lack of random play for mp3. You may think it's not a big deal initially, but if you ever try to play any mp3 audio on this, you will immediately realize this thing is totally useless."
1,Great Player that just doesn't last,"Bought the Player in November to have for Christmas. It lasted until about March (Just out of service warranty). Then the carousel door would only open halfway - the electronics are messed up, because the door is mechanically OK. Great price, and it worked great while it lasted. If you buy this, get the extended warranty for sure!"
3,No Luck with Playing MP3's,"Not a bad machine overall for the low price. Unfortunately, my Toshiba SD 2805 player does not want to play MP3's. I have tried lots of different MP3's and have had very little luck with the machine reading them. Most of them cannot be recognized. The DVD features are good if a bit clumsy. The remote is small with lots of buttons and a bit complicated (this is common). The price is great for a 5 disc player. Hope you have better luck playing your MP3's."
3,basic primer on Papa in Key West just as advertised,"Having visited Hemingways home a couple of months ago I was drawn to this small volume on the writer's time in Key West.The tiny book is as advertised; however, there are many books available to give much more complete accounts of the 30's in Key West and how they connected to Hemingway. The book is as advertised and simply covers some of the history and background with nice drawings and photos."
5,Expected quality and perfect mix of tools,"Needed a knife for my cub scout and after looking at the cub scout version of the swiss army knife decided on this one instead. Much better value, probably because it doesn't have to have the scout logo upcharge on it. Wanted a knife without a corkscrew on it (why bother for an 8 year old!) and this one fit the bill. He is delighted and I liked it so much I bought a second for my girl scout. Versatile and excellent quality. Not as heavy-duty as my leatherman but a great choice for a pocketnife."
4,A good knife,"I buy this knife as a gift for my mom, she loves it. It is solid, handy and looks like good quality and will last long."
4,Fitting honor for Dr. Macrae,"Allan Macrae was a highly interesting figure. Well trained -- MDiv at Princeton Seminary, MA at Princeton Univ., doctoral work under Harnack in Berlin, PhD under Speiser at Univ. of Penn. He was Reformed (Bible Presbyterian, eventually PCA), but premil with dispensational tendencies and pietistic (holiness codes, abstinence from alcohol). He was a founding faculty at Westminister in 1929, left to be founding president of McIntire's more fundamnetalist Faith Seminary in 1936, and left Faith to be founding president of the more moderate Biblical Seminary in Hatfield, PA. He saw it all!I visited him several times in his 90s at a nursing home and was amazed by his kindness, piety, intelligence and knowledge. He was a real master of the OT.These essays are uneven. All express love and respect for Dr. Macrae, but some could use much better editting. One essay, for example, repeatedly misspells Abraham Kuyper as ""Kuiper!""Overall, a very nice and helpful tribute to a great man."
2,Dimensions,"The description gave 2 different dimensions - I looked at the first one and thought that it would work for what I needed it for... when I got the case, it was clearly smaller than the first set of dimenions said.... had to send it back. This case is only good for the portable DVD players, not a laptop computer.....not even a small one."
1,"Breaks very easy, find a better quality product",Agree with the above reviews. Dropped mine this morning and it broke right at the base.Nice looking product but just ordered the OXO squeegee with the black handle. Looks like a more stable product and the reviews are great.
1,Don't Drop It!,This squeegee had a sleek and understated design and it worked perfectly for 3 months but oops! one drop in the shower and the handle broke right off! I'll give it 1 star just becuse it looked good while it lasted.
3,"weak handle, but it is clear","We've had 2 of these, they each lasted a year before the handles broke, not by dropping, but just from the pressure of squeegeeing (and we don't press extra hard or anything). So yes, the handles are weaker than they should be. But on the other hand, they're the only totally clear ones we've come across, which works well with our wraparound glass shower enclosure. So I'll probably buy another one. If you don't care about your squeegee being clear you might want to look for a sturdier one."
2,InterDesign Squeegee,"I would avoid this squeegee at all costs. As other reviewers state, this thing is prone to breaking at the slightest of things. I put a slight pressure on it and the handle just snapped in half. This combined with the other reviews has led me to believe this is just a poorly constructed product that should be avoided"
5,Excellent,"This is exactly what I am looking for - looked all over town - couldn't find it, then here it was on Amazon. Wonderful !"
4,"John R, Ernie's record mart","This brings back memories of yesterday when about all you could get on the am radio at night was WLAC. I rated this a 4 instead of 5 because I would like to hear more clips from John R. I used to have some cassettes put out by the man himself (John Richbourg), but lost them long ago. These had great music, but also were shows including the commercials with a lot of dialogue from John R. Remember the baby chicks, Royal Crown and all the great ""blue plate specials"" of 45's."
1,Recycled Punk Rock and a Stolen Band Name,"I have heard 4 of the songs on this cd and while they do not sound awful, they are purely recycled blend of a bunch of Epitaph Bands that did this a generation ago. F.Face is probably their best song, which is why they put it first on the album. The overall performance is lackluster and un-inspiring. Not to mention that they stole the band name from someone else and then trademarked it before sending threatening communications to them. The original Cab Assassin formed in the D.C. area and began using the name in 2002. They are not poppy punk rock but more of a post-punk/post-rock sounding project and goes under the name of Lou Albino most of the time. Hopefully these guys are done with so our ears don't have to suffer anymore."
3,oakeydoakey,"A bit sparse on close-up shots of genitalia, which is sort of the point in the first place. No full erections. Pretty tame for Playgirl."
3,Super Reader,"Kothar the Cumberian. With a name like that you might suspect that this character is a Conan knockoff. Well, in this case, if you thought that, you would pretty much suspect-o correct-o.He leads a defensive force against an invading wizard and narrowly loses.One difference is that he has a magic sword. A lich offers it to him to use to save the queen whose army has just been destroyed. He'd rather keep the sword than have the princedom she offers him for rescuing her wizard.He also gets paid to go treasure hunting, and finds a minotaur, and deals with a witch woman in a wood, and actually gets to go sword to sword with a sorcerous baron."
3,Ruby Jean And Joe,A rodeo movie about an aging cowboy and a girl trying to find a direction in life .It has a very good cast that develops the material in a professional manner .
4,LJH Idaho,I really enjoyed this movie. Selleck is at his best as an aging rodeo rider. He is provided a reason to discard part of his resentment of life and redeem himself. Good movie; would recommend.
5,This one hit home.,"I saw this movie for the first time in 1996 - about a week before my birthday. I was trying to come to grips with several personal issues at once myself: Getting older, changing jobs, past relationships, alcoholism and loneliness. Selleck's character, though older than me, was all too familiar. His performance, as well as the entire cast, brought the story to life in an honest, believable way. The story goes to show that it's okay to have faults. It's also important to recognize who your real friends are and accept their help, too. Lastly, you cannot judge a person by their appearance, either. As Ruby Jean observes, ""You must be somebody you don't look like."" I'm not ashamed to say this movie brings this biker to tears every time I watch it. (Usually on my birthday.)"
4,brilliant book,"Practical Carp Fishing was an insightful yet straight to the point book. It combined instruction and elegant prose into one masterpiece. My only problem about giving the book an excellent review was the authors proposition that carp are "" for the most part evil creatures "". I found this view to be not only hateful, but completely contradictory to the huge mass of research suggesting the complete opposite. Also disturbing was the author's "" carp as slaves "" suggestion. This book will certainly set carp fishing back 20 to 30 years in most anglers minds"
4,brilliant book,"This book touched upon many different aspects of carp fishing. It was not only very informative, but was expressed in exquisite prose. What I didn't understand was the books emphasis on the hypothesis that carp are "" generally evil creatures "". I thought these sentiments were not only full of hate, but completely contradictory to the huge mass of research which suggests the complete opposite. What also stuck out to me was the book's "" carp as slaves "" suggestion. Otherwise, the book was great."
5,Carp Fishing,"A sad story about a dsyfunctional Carp family during the the depression. The author takes us on a journey of violence and alchoholism in which Carl, the patriarch drives his family to suicide. Eventually Carl is caught on a ""hair rig"" and srved up as "" Sweet and Sour Carp"" at a local Chinese restaraunt."
1,barbaric book,"I found most of the premise behind this book to be barbaric.julian's advice on using treble hooks all the time is dangerous, as well as costly. his constant references to spearing carp as ""fine sport"" were also offensive, as well as his refering to people he meets as either ""pirates"" or ""crumb-bums"" also was uncalled for. the pictures and illustrations of the inside of his bivvy were exceptional but his final message of using trot lines and jugging as a way to quick success, was, i felt to be disturbing"
3,Too Light!,"These sticks are really really light. I learned on heavier sticks and I was pretty good with them. I had to basically re-learn the sticks with these because they are so light and therefore very hard to control. I added some extra tape to the ends which made it a little easier. Also, the way the tape is on them, it's really hard to keep it from rolling as you toss it from stick to stick.,"
5,Excellent Product,"This is an excellent product - great quality and construction. The sticks were for my daughter, but the entire family enjoys trying them. And the company - Funn & Frolic - is excellent to work with."
2,Most difficult devil sticks you can buy,"I've owned about 5 pairs of devil sticks in my life, and these are by far the most difficult ones I've ever used. Very heavy, not very grippy, and liable to break your toe if you drop them barefoot. Definitely not fit for kids, and definitely not for beginners. That said, at least they're sturdy,"
1,They have a terrible smell!,The smell from the rubber is so strong my son can't even stand to use them. Hopefully after they sit for a while it will fade! If not then what a waste!
4,Searching,"Sandra Tate is a highly successful architect whose personal life is disjointed and slowly falling apart. After ending her long-term relationship and then recuperating from a serious health scare, she finds a clue in her deceased father's belongings as to her long-lost mother's whereabouts. Sandra buys a motorcycle and begins her journey to find her mother, and along the way she finds herself healing and finding a real love. After a rocky start, ""Midas Touch"" becomes a fun lesbian romance about a third of the way through, where the reader eagerly awaits the resolution of Sandra's journey. Frankie Jones delivers not only some hot sex, but a marvelous romance that charms and entertains."
1,Sutch...not worth it,"I have to admit, I don't own this CD. Nor will I ever own it. I do, however, have it on vinyl. I picked it up cheap from a used record store in Gainesville in the mid 1970s. I have listened to it three times - twice when I purchased it and once a number of years later. While there are a number of excellent musicians on this album, their work is wasted. The songs are trite, with putrid lyrics, and horrible vocals. To paraphrase another reviewer, ""if you can get past the vocals and the lyrics""...I find that IMPOSSIBLE. These guys had to be having a laugh at Sutch, because they're too GOOD to put up with something SO BAD. And it is that: SO bad!"
2,a strange piece of rock music history,"I remember seeing this in an lp bargain bin, many many years ago, and almost made the purchase because of the ""heavy friends"" listed on the cover. I was warned, however, that the album was really terrible, so I passed, being a young person with little $$ in my pocket. Now I'm in my early 50s, and I listened to the sounds on this album for the very first time, thanks to Amazon's sound clips. So, I found out for myself just how awful it really is. Actually, a lot of the instrumental backing is interesting to listen to, and I can clearly hear the influences of these ""heavy friends"" in a good way. Unfortunately, the singer is just way too terrible, which ruins the entire thing. But, in a strange way, it was fun listening to these sound clips. This was the album that everyone knew of, but nobody bought, because we all knew how terrible it was, even though we never knew firsthand -- a strange little lp that evolved into a strange little cd."
4,Another point of view,"This book, unlike other books about Taiji and weapon forms, describes the sword form from the application point of view. How has the Jian developed to become what it is per today, who used it and what techniques are used in combat? He describes clearly the differences between the Yang family style and the public sword form. What I find remarkable are the differences between the public form described in the book and the public form described by (for example) Chen Wei-Ming. This book is worthwhile studying for those who want to have more background in Taiji sword."
5,Lightworkers take note!,"This book is right on target for lightworkers out there who are just awakening to their future roles on earth. Very uselful, and IMO LEGIT info!Definately worth a read!It also provides more insite on where the world is headed in the next decade. VERY up to date.This book goes right to the top of my list of metaphysical books I recomment to friends. Other favorites - B. Weiss, N. Walsh, D. Virtue, J. Redfield, E. Cayce - There Is A River."
5,Recommended Reading for Awakening,"Reader friendly, providing wonderful insights into who we really are and the power that we all have that comes from within."
1,Yuckee,"OK, I'm 53, workout alot and my Dr says I need more fiber. I also want a protein supplement so I bought the EfaGold Weed Extract. I read the reviews and thought ""what the hell, I can add a scoop of weirdness to my life"". Wrong! It is 4 scoops of weirdness. 4 TABLESPOONS per serving. 30 grams. A whole bag of ground up weed!I just did 2 Tbs in a 12oz glass with a scoop of gaterade powder and it was a similar experience to drinking unfavored mud. If you made a smoothie of this crap NO ONE would sit next to you when you drank it.Before I started to write this I thought, ""I'll finish it"" but upon reflection, why torture myself. I'm returning it.Byron"
5,Eva Gold,This tastes much better than the Manitoba Harvest brand and is half of the price that you pay in a health food store.
2,Very Gritty...,"The taste isnt whats bad...its the gritty-ness. I purchased the Nutiva product which was straight protein and loved it! The taste was fine, it mixes well with whey or with coconut milk. Alas I needed something with fiber and this was the cheaper option. If you make protein shakes with yogurt or something thick, then this is the product for you. It does not mix well with thinner mediums."
3,its ok,I bought this brand as well as nutiva and I prefer the nutiva brand in comparison. This nature way brand I find is grainy.
4,Cynthiana is a killer!!!!,I really like Cynthiana the best. Her version of Thank you is better than Alantis. It really gets you moving and I love to dance.Bianca is also great on this cd.Keep up the good work girls. Axel...you need a little help. Big Cy.
2,Not the same cd as listed in other reviews,"By the description in other reviews I thought this had all the cool songs from the tv series and the ova, but it is actually the soundtrack to the tv series. AND it doesn't even have the opening and closing songs to the show!!! It is strictly the backround music and the songs sung by Bad Luck and Nettle Grasper. So if that is what you want than you will enjoy this cd, but if you are looking for the opening and closing songs, along with the others, then you will be very disappointed. As I was."
5,A must have for any one who love's the music on Gravitation.,"Well the title pritty much sez it all.^^.I love the gravitation amime music. This cd has one that is herd in the anime + 2 other songs by Bad Luck and one by Nittle Grasper. There are some other tunes on the cd but all in all it only has those 4 songs sung by the to Bands. Its an ace cd though im so glade that i got it, and if you love Gravitaion anime and the music from it as much as i do then you will love this cd^-^.Names of the songs that are on the cd:-Songs by Bad luck:-(1) Blind Game again (this was the one herd in the Gravitation anime)(2)Smashing Blue(3)In the moonlightSong by Nittle Grasper:- (1) Shining Collection.Hope this review helps you guys out there.^^"
4,Almost great,"This is a truly compelling read. I looked forward to returning to this book each time I was forced to leave it. The characters are well drawn, and there is a well-paced forward motion.Unfortunately, there were flaws, too. In order to convey information through the young narrator, the reader was expected to believe that Penny got herself into any number of unbelievable situations. Worse for me was the fact that the author let her views on the issue of abortion overpower her characters. It is certainly Sharp's story to tell, but I wish she had done just that--told the story. The politics are there; we didn't need to be hit over the head with them.But you won't be sorry to read it. Just don't pick this one up when you have a lot of other things to attend to. It's really hard to put down."
3,A Great Read,"Abortion. Relationships. Understanding. Addiction. Secrets. Love. Healing. Intrigued? Paula Sharps's 'I Loved You All' offers all of the above and more. She has created a novel full of unforgettable characters and story that could easily happen. The characters will make you laugh, understand, shake your head, and gasp!I Loved You All is set against the backdrop of the 1970's Pro Life Movement while a mother is battling an addiction and desperately trying to hold on to those she loves. The novel primarily centres on the mother-daughter relationship and how easily it can de disrupted by both external and internal forces.Paula Sharp presents a very serious and debatable subject...abortion. She does this with class and does not belabour the issue. The true focus is on the development and repair of relationships not providing a forum for the Pro Life/Pro Choice debate.I encourage others to seek out this book and other titles by Sharp. ~Kelly"
3,Think before you buy,"I agree with the other reviewers about elements of McCartney. However, it's not his best elements. Think Monkberry Moon Delight or Uncle Albert. It's pretty. The production is excellent, but the songs themselves consist of simplistic chords and melodies. He has an impressive voice with a nice style, but the songs are just so soft. Good for the easy listening crowd and kids."
4,Inspiration for songwriters,"I picked this CD up last week and am already sending it as a gift to someone else. I am a songwriter and find this CD very enjoyable. David is a great writer. He leads you with deep lyrical verses followed by choruses that carry a payoff. You can hear his musical infuences too. At times you can pick out who he sounds like, either by his vocal delivery or his writing. I could pick out Paul MacCartney and Paul Simon easily. This album is soft pop. There's nothing edgy or abrasive about it. I have to laugh at the song Figure of Eight. It is a beautiful song, but I found myself singing ""Goodbye YellowBrick Road"" over some of the changes."
4,Very much improved!,"Adobe appears to have corrected most of the problems with Contibute 3.0. It is now a stable, flexible, and predictable application for those wishing to format web pages for personal or business use. I have been using it for over a month with no problems. My next step is to integrate Dreamweaver, which I am looking forward to."
1,Quality poor,"This thing never worked right from the beginning. It was loose in construction, many times I would have to start over as the counter would not start. I finally went to Home Depot and bought one with 2 wheels and made sure it worked in the store. You get what you pay for and this one was cheaper but definitely not worth the money,time and effort."
1,STINKS!,"I have NEVER had much trouble with printers. They get a few years old and just stop working. But I've had nothing but problems with this horrific device! From the beginning, the manual was practically in Chinese, the operation was so complicated that I had to refer to (and decipher) the manual over and over. I would never buy anything from BroHoe again, and suggest you STAY AWAY!"
1,a graphic designer's opinion,"i just got this printer. used it yesterday and today to find out that the photo quality in not just ""not amazing"" but quite poor. solid colors are fine, but, for example, when printing an area that's 100% yellow and 50% magenta, the dots are very noticeable. the registration of the colors is also quite bad, so it looks poor when, for example again, you print a size 12 font with serif that's white on blue. you can see the magenta around the white font. blacks are fine at 100%, but any gradient under that looks just not satisfactory. you can easily notice the dots, and type in gray becomes had to read due to the lack of continued lines -because of the dot size- and the inconsistency of the solid gray area."
5,Makes a wonderful gluten-free all purpose flour with other flours,"Sorghum flour is wonderful and Bob's Red Mill has a superior product, here. It is a fine, smooth flour, unlike regular rice flour. Mixing it with potato starch and tapioca starch makes for a wonderful all-purpose gluten-free flour. Some recipes need more starch, others do not. Check out Carol Fenster's all purpose sorghum flour recipe at [...]"
2,"Seriously, Canon? Buy a third-party padded case instead.","This case comes with a variety of Canon lenses. It has almost NO padding, and is closed by an insecure drawstring. I suggest purchasing a third-party case with padding, zipper closures, and attachment options (loops, handles, etc.). Lowepro is my preferred brand. e.g.-Lowepro Lens Case 11 x 14 cm (Black)-Lowepro Lens Case 11 x 11 cm (Black)If you are buying thousands of dollars in quality glass, get first-class protection for less money. As shown by the excellent case Canon offers for the 70-200mm f/2.8 IS USM L lens, they know how to make a nice padded case. Unfortunately with this they're trying to sell you a sub-standard (albeit nice-looking) case at premium prices."
4,Not bad,"This mat is better than what I expected.- The surface doesn't get sticky, stays relatively clean in busy kitchen.- It stays flat, doesn't get in the way, it's practically invisible.- I don't notice my feet getting tired as much, I think the mat's helping."
3,Not worth the price,I bought this since I just converted over to a standing desk and all I can say is that it wasn't worth the price. The material is thin and my heels are in absolute agony when standing on this mat.
5,TAKE SOME STRAIN OFF YOUR KNEES,"My wife swears by (not at) this mat. It is soft and yet stable, and seems (after several months now) to be durable. I have never tried a competitor, but this one works pretty much as advertised."
4,Good Mat for a standing desk,"I have been using this mat with my standing desk for about a week, and it works pretty well. I stand barefoot between 6-10 hours a day, and this has proven incredibly helpful on the concrete floor in my basement.My only complaint is that the mat tends to scoot around on the floor as I step on it. So about once a day I have to reposition the mat, but that isn't such a problem.If you are looking to transition to a standing desk, this is probably the best anti-fatigue mat for the money."
2,Not enough...,"The padding for the antifatigue mat is not thick enough, and the mat isn't big enough if you are a taller person. Ordering a second mat instead."
2,Typical fantasy/contemporary crossover,"This book is typical rehashed crossover material. From the elf to the ""grendel"". I found myself not caring one bit for any of the characters. The dialogue is contrived and the concept just sets you up for a boring read. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this book and, God forbid, the 12 book series. An elf in the NYC subways? Yawn."
3,An Extremely Interesting Concept,"Edghill's The Sword of Maiden's Tears is a fairly light read, but the author does a splendid job of drawing together story threads, weaving a coherent narrative--and making numerous amusing references to a wide variety of popular fantasy and science fiction. I had a wonderful time reading this book, but it is strictly a light read (or a SCAdian playground, alternatively). The characterizations are occasionally a little flat, but the main characters are likable and very ""human"""
4,An Elf in New York City,"Sounds cliched, doesn't it? I thought long and hard before I bought this book, but I've found a marvelous author. Rosemary Edghill manages to avoid the cliches that abound in modern fantasy novels. She has created a world were good doesn't win through deus ex machina, but actually has to struggle. The protagonists actually have character flaws. Now, how often does that happen to the good guys? If you want a book, and a series, that doesn't allow easy choices, then try ""The Twelve Treasures.&quot"
4,Has held up for years!,"My daughter is an only child and has way more than I ever had as a child. She usually loses interest in games/toys fairly quickly but we have had this game for years and we still play it. Whenever it comes time to purge, she makes it very clear that this one is a keeper. I haven't experienced any problems with quality mentioned in some of the other reviews."
2,Even LMN doesn't show this,"About to embark on an arranged marriage, the daughter of a Caribbean dictator (Charlotte Ayana) crashes into a poor fisherman (Kuno Becker). Injured, she brings him home to the mansion, where he continues to hurt himself so he can stay and she fights her attraction to the inappropriate suitor while getting ready for her wedding. Meanwhile, the commandant (A Martinez) is off in his own little world since losing his beloved wife, unaware that there is something fishy going on with his government.The acting is pretty bad, with accents all over the place (and a camera fixated on Ayanna's light blue eyes which appeared scary at times). I had a hard time with Esai Morales in this comedy role - he is funny, but not in here - it was like he was channeling Raul Julia as Gomez Adams - a poor imitation at that. It's basically a cheesy Lifetime movie that isn't even good enough for repeat viewings on LMN."
2,Barely Bearable,"I rented this film and it sounded somewhat interesting but I was severely disappointed. While the film making was well done for the most part the story itself was very formulaic and a paint by the numbers. I felt that any crew fresh out of film school could have slapped this together and probably have done a better job. So if you are into prince and the pauper romantic comedies mixed with a little bit of fantasy you'll enjoy it, otherwise pick another film."
1,Dull and Boring,I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is dull and boring. The writer gives absoloutely no insights into any of the characters. This book was not worth my money or my time.
2,meter setting too flimsy,"Very solid unit but the key piece is the meter reader and when resetting it you can tell it would not last long with a survey crew, returned it."
2,not bad.....,A decent alternative when craving the teriyaki flavor nuggets when the teriyaki isn't available. Subscribe and save is the only way to go on these. Buddies enjoyed this product during the games. A-1 flavor isn't spot on but nuggets are worth the order.
5,"product grate, seller shipped the wrong one.....","I LOVE THE PRODUCT, I HAD A HRAD TIME FINDING IT, SO I WENT TO AMAZON AND FOUND IT.. IT WAS SENT, IT WAS THE WRONG ONE. SO I CALLED AND SPOKE TO THE SELLER, HE SAID, HE WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM, AND CALL ME BACK THAT SAME DAY. DID NOT.... HEAR BACK...CALLED AGAIN, HE SAID THE SAME THING.NO RESPONSE.... WOULD NOT EVER ORDER FORM THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Good music...HORRID sound,"The music on this disc is first class, but the sound is absolutely HORRID. For a disc that was released by Columbia/Legacy, and not some bootleg, i'm quite disappointed. The highs are very shrill, but much worse is the lows. THERE ARE NONE. You can not hear a single drumbeat or bass note. They have been compeltely destroyed. A few of these tracks are repeated on two other Columbia releases, where they sound significantly better.If you want to get some Les Brown, just get the only two in-print Columbia releases of Les Brown's 40s material: Best Of The Big Bands-Les Brown & Les Brown and His Great Vocalists. There is very little repetition in tracks, and the sound is far better."
3,disappointed,"Have the original VHS release,thought this ""update"" should be better, wrong,sound no better then the tape,in fact I think worse,ditto the picture quality.A big disappointment since the cast for this performance is excellent."
3,"Brava, Scotto!","Opera is about the music, nothing else. Libretto should be like the batter in a fruitcake, only just enough to hold all the good stuff together .. and all the good stuff is the music. Nothing should ever distract from the singing. Carreras is his magnificent self here, and Scotto ..as Musetta! .. absolutely dazzles! Stratas' voice is debatable but in any case lost in her behavior, very like a hummingbird on speed .. or a ""looka me!"" six year old determined to dominate the conversation. What a pity Carreras could never have sung Boheme with Monserrat Caballe."
4,An old friend,"This was my first opera, the one that really got me into opera, and I probably watched our VHS of it over 100 times during college (there was a span there where I was literally watching it every night). Anyway, I was really sad when we got rid of our VHS player, and had been looking for a DVD version of this particular production, which for me will always be the quintessential La Boheme, for a long time. It's so exciting to finally have it in my possession, however, when it came time to watch it, it would not work in my laptop, nor in the DVD player at school. It did work in my friend's laptop (we both have macs, but hers is slightly older)."
4,Arm Socks.....Lol,"The arm warmers were for my girl friend. She loves them no matter what they are made of or how practicle they may not be..... As long as she's happy, I'm happy with the purchase....Lol"
5,Scholarly and Pastoral,"I am a pastor and have appreciated all of the volumes in this series. They have been careful to deal with scholarly details, and yet not encumbered by them. This volume seems like a series of sermons that grew out of his pastoral ministry. I found as I worked through Job that this was one of the commentaries I kept in front of me."
2,Taking liberties,"The author takes a lot of liberties in adding what he thinks are part of the Job story. For example, he says that when Job sat in the ashes that means he went to the dump and sat in those ashes. Since people in that time had fires outside (too hot to be in their homes) for cooking, it wouldn't seem reasonable for him to spend his time at the city dump. Also, he says that Job didn't have boils but probably had elephantiasis. Since the bible tells us that Job had boils and took a broken pot to scrap the wounds (i.e. open up the boils to drain) then it wouldn't seem logical that elephantiasis was his condition since it doesn't involve wounds that can be opened. There are many things like this in the book - things that he can't prove that detract from the book and even the story of Job."
5,Great Gift!,"My fiance and I ordered these for our groomsmen as their wedding party gift. They arrived promptly and in great condition. The knives were of sturdy construction, a nice hefty weight, but not too large that you couldn't actually carry it in your pocket without your pants falling down. When we handed out the gifts, the guys couldn't stop raving about the knives. So as long as they work as well as they look, we will be in great shape. I would definitely buy/recommend this product again!"
2,Dissappointed!!!,I bought this product due to one thing it was supposed to be a craftsman item but no where on the knife does it say or show this!!! They do not sell craftsman knives anymore and that is all my friend wanted it for because he lost his!!! :(
1,Meade Tripod,"My Meade telescope came with the 882 standard tripod. The telescope is great, but the tripod is a piece of junk. The plastic locking mechanisms on each of the legs has broken off and I have had to tape the legs to a fully extended position. The unit is less than one year old."
5,Meade Telescope Tripod,"I have had this tripod for three years, bought it as a present for my husband. We have never had any of the troubles noted in other reviews. Nothing breaks and it is easy to adjust the legs and move it around. It is a good tripod for beginners and adults to use with a Polaris telescope."
1,Mine broke too!,"I picked one of these up off eBay. It was new, but could have been very old stock. My first impressions were good, but my previous experience was with camera tripods. Compared to camera tripods it seems quite robust. The legs are thick aluminum and the head is heavy cast steel.Since I've seen more telescope tripods, I realize this is pretty lightweight by comparison. More experienced people say steel legs are much better in reducing vibration than aluminum (and wood best of all).And sadly, like everyone else, one of the leg catches broke on my second outing... fortunately I picked up a few spare legs on eBay!"
3,Rickety but still working,"I understand the frustration that other reviewers have experienced with this tripod. It feels cheap and rickety. After six months of moderate use, I can report that mine still works and I have had no catastrophic failures or even a tipped over scope. Of course, I have been extra gentle with the tripod because of its lousy reputation. The legs still fully extend and none of the cheap plastic locks have come off. One of the rubber end points came off during my last excursion, but some super glue and duct tape saw the tripod back to full form.The bottom line is that it works for my Meade ETX-60 and with some extra care it may actually last a while, so long as I do not mind a few band-aid fixes."
1,Great telescope but poor tripod,I have had the #882 little more than a year and 1 leg adjusting tab has broken off and 1 of the other 2 is cracked.
1,"info good, but unfocused..",Just get his audiobooks. Cuz those are actually fantastic and filled full of good insights. This DVD however was as cornball as it gets.
1,Awful cookware!,"This cookware was originally sold by hsn with either a 55 yr or 75 warranty. Well, innova went out of business and now all customers are left with junk cookware. The nonstick flakes and peels and no one will help consumers get any warranty satisfaction. Read the message board at hsn.com for hundreds of unhappy customer comments. Stay away from this cookware no matter how good a deal it seems to be. You will be very unhappy!"
5,BUY IT!!!,"As an insane fan of Mr. Joss Whedon, I bought Fray hoping it would be good. Well, it wasn't. It was great.I didn't know if I would like Fray, but I loved her. I sat and read it during my classes and never felt the least bit silly that I'm almost 30 and I was reading a comic book. I gasped at plot twists, I laughed at the jokes, and I sniffled at the sad parts. (and it's Joss. You know there is a sad part. Bastard!)My only complaint is that I wish there were more."
2,"Well, still better than Season 7...","Certainly better than ""Buffy: Season 7"", Fray captures some of the goofy spirit that made the television show so enjoyable for so long. However, despite Whedon's best efforts (or maybe because of them), it still feels like a toothless attempt at TV series.There are no emotional connections deep enough to surprise or shock the reader, although that doesn't stop Whedon from 'shocking' revelations at every turn.The art is better than average, and supports the gimmicky future that Whedon has built.Still, a mildy entertaining (if self-indulgent) contribution to the Buffy mythos, if not to the comic book industry as a whole."
4,Shiny,"I enjoyed Fray. It's not a towering epic, but it's a good story and fun to read. Since it's Joss Whedon, there's snappy dialogue, teenage girls with superpowers, and flying cars. Also a hellmouth, abyssal sidekicks, and a legendary weapon that looks like the angry love child of a spear and a battleaxe.One thing I love about the way this man writes science fiction is, he doesn't get caught up in the technology. Other writers focus on the complexity of their gadgets; Whedon focuses on the complexity of his characters. Not that they're terribly complex, but they certainly clear the bar for the genre by a great deal. Fray is a graphic novel about people, and it happens to contain glittery space things that incinerate worlds. Scratch that-- there's a huge insecty demon, but no glittery world incineration.Anyway, I liked it. It didn't blow up my mind real good, but it was very cool. I'm pretty sure that was the idea."
2,not as impressive as the older version,"I have the same handbook published 10 years back. It is much more comprehensive with more pictures and detail.basically ,I bought another to give as gift to the local Library and now I am disappointed.recommend you find old print.That original version is a must have for Architects and builders.Minoo"
1,Too modern,"Technology is great, but sometimes building methods of native people are ""better"" than our scientific methods. From an engineering standpoint it was a great book but as a book for someone curious about many ways of building things I was a little disappointed."
5,"One of the best modern SF novels ever, period.","I found this novel to be tremendously uplifting and inspiring. It's typically dense and complex and if you're not paying attention you'll miss the boat. There are some excellent PKDick novels still in print, but this one really takes on a life of its own.""I mean, after all; you have to consider we're only made out of dust. That's admittedly not much to go on and we shouldn't forget that. But even considering, I mean it's a sort of bad beginning, we're not doing too bad. So I personally have faith that even in this lousy situation we're faced with we can make it. You get me?""Highest possible recommendation."
5,Might be my favorite PKD novel yet,"I have loved several of Dick's books, including ""A Scanner Darkly"" ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" and ""Ubik"" but I think ""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"" might be the most disturbingly familiar and profoundly challenging novel of them all. It is a captivating look at drug culture, the subjective nature of reality, and personal and societal ethics. There is simply no denying the brilliance of this author, and anyone who reads this book will be provoked by the questions it poses."
5,This Book Converted Me Into an Instant PKD Fan,"Philip K. Dick is probably my favorite author at the time, and it is probably because of this novel. I disliked the first novel of his that I read and I wrote PKD off after that experience. It was months before I gave him another shot. I already had this book so I felt obligated to read it. ""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"" was instantly captivating and I was converted into a PKD fan. I am unable to articulate why I enjoyed this book so much; I think it is something you just have to experience for yourself. Dick is able to create worlds so easily and then bring them crashing down around his characters. If you have already written PKD off like I did, give this novel a shot. It's well worth it."
4,Mind expanding but exhausting,"Not untypical of PKD, this book is at once a story; a metaphysical view of man, religious spirituality, and reality; and a treatise on social mores. If you are trying to get it all and follow the story too, it does get a bit exhausting. PKD is a master of ""is this real, or is this real?"". Better at some point to give up on the reality of the story and focus on the message(s)."
4,One wild ride,"This was a great read. Admittedly probably not the best choice for one's first Philip K. Dick novel (as it was mine), but it was an incredible journey."
5,Trippy???,"Can a book mimic the effect of a drug experience? I don't know. I don't have enough experience with hallucinogens. But, I would probably guess not. However, ""The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch"" certainly induces some kind of altered state in its readers. Reality keeps shifting, changing like a bunch of Russian nesting dolls - one world inside another inside another. I think this is Phil's best work (though I have yet to read Valis). I don't know if I would make it my first PKD book, however. You might want to read some others to get acclimated to his style of reality-bending. ""Time Out of Joint"" and the classic ""Ubik"" might be good points of departure."
3,"Interesting ideas, flawed execution.","Dick's central conceit--how do we know what is real and what is imagined?--is an interesting one, and the paranoia (?) it engenders in his protagonist makes for a thought-provoking read. But the use of mind-altering drugs and certain other elements of this novel make it seem dated. More to the point, most of the characters are not persuasively drawn; they are stilted caricatures more than real people. By comparison, Ursula LeGuin's The Lathe of Heaven covers similar territory, but with more credible characters; as a result it is a much more forceful (and scarier) book."
2,Disappointing,Not what I expected at all. seemed to be a disjointed story. Must have to be a fan of Dicks to understand his writings.
3,Not his best work,"If you are new to PKD, start with Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. I would follow that up with Ubik (my favorite so far), and Radio Free Albemuth.Palmer Eldritch was really weird (which I like), but the ending didn't tie it together as well as some of his best works did."
5,A must-have!!,Excellent product and great price! Perfect for attached toys to kicknplays... carseats... etc. My son loves these!
5,One of the must-haves,"Ever since I started working with severely handicapped children, I learned the value of these type of rings. They are great for grasping and chewing, as well as holding toys where baby can reach them. Add to that the bright colors and counting rings included with this set, and you can't go wrong. This was the first toy my baby grasped for, and remains a favorite."
2,Incorrectly Advertised,In the description it says it comes wit 15 rings when in fact it only comes with 9. I contacted Amazon...who had me contact Baby Einstein who had me contact KidsII who wrote back to me saying that 9 is the correct amount. The number keys did not even have a number 1! I was not happy with the product and since it was a gift and opened at a birthday party I could not return it. I feel that all of the parties involved should get the product details straight before selling it.
1,Check healthy toys.org for this product.......,This product is on the list of tested toys on healthytoys.org. It has high levels of chlorine/PCV. My son liked his but I've taken them away.
2,Hurt baby's mouth,"I bought this toy because of the cute catterpillar part. Other than that it's just a bunch of rings. Well, my son is an avid chewer, and he put the catterpillar ring into his mouth and it got caught around his cheek (if you know what I mean, with one side being inside his mouth and the other side outside his mouth.) He was very upset about this, as was I. I would not recommend this item for that reason. If you received this as a shower gift I would suggest just using the smaller rings, since the openings are smaller and safer for chewing."
