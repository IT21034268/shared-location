4,Sofia Recital is wonderful yet there are problems with the CD,"I was introduced to the orchestral presentation (by Reiner and the CSO) of Pictures at an Exhibition while in high school in the late 1960s---one of my favorite compositions---and didn't know that Mussorgsky wrote it for solo piano until much later. Finally having heard of Richter's version, I made the purchase. It, too, is wonderful. The recording does have its issues: background white noise, audience noise, etc.. But those are minor, expected (for the timeframe), annoyances. A major annoyance, however, is the quality of the CD. The first two copies I received from Amazon were unplayable. A third copy was slightly better; I was able, with some difficulty, to transfer its contents to a good, blank, CD using my PC. Try that if you experience the same."
2,"Superb playing, poor sound","The playing of Sviatoslav Richter is superb, but the sound is appaling, very dim. The old, Melodya LP recording was much brighter!"
2,Mac compatible !!????!!,So first of all for all the Mac users out there that haven't purchased a camera yet - beware!!!!I was really excited when I read the one review that this one is actually Mac compatible and a list on a the apple website confirmed too that this camera is compatibleI managed to get it into iMovie which was nice but once I started editing the footage I noticed that the quality was very bad! I tried all kinds of different modes on the camera but nothing helpedSo if you want a nice quality camera for a Mac this isn't the one for you!!!You might want to check out the featured cameras on the apple site and spend a couple more bucks just to save you some major headachesSo far none of the Sony products worked well for Mac except still cameras!!!!I hope this is helpful for all the Mac users
4,I love this camcorder! Thanks to reviews on Amazon.com!,"Before I bought this camera, I read the reviews of this one and others to compare and I even compared Mini-DV and Digital and thanks to the positive reviews on this camera (and it was in my price range) I bought it. I was not disappointed. I have only had it a month and I have used it many times. The mic pics up well, and the zoom works great (which I use for my kids sports). I have downloaded video to my laptop, and burned DVD's. I took the advice of other customers and bought the longer life battery. The only difficulty I had was in not understanding that formatting meant deleting what you had already recorded on the disc, so I now know. My laptop did not have DVD burning capabilities so I did purchase an external burner and everything works great. I would recommend this camera to anyone who has a budget but wants a quality camcorder."
4,good overall; except...,"The picture is clear and recording is easy, the only bad thing is that the discs are so expensive. Deleting is simple and makes recording even easier, because if you don't like it you can delete it."
1,dead already,I owned the camcorder for less than 40 days when it died and wouldn't turn back on. I called the service center and they talked me through a trouble shooting attempt but they couldn't get it working. I had to send it to Texas for a repair. I'll bet it was a used camcorder that I received instead of a new one and that's why it died soooo soon.
2,VERY POOR slow motion,"If you really need to jump around from scene to scene on your video using the touch scren, then I guess this product might work for you. But if you want good picture quality, and smooth (not herky-jerky) slow motion, then stick with Sony's MiniDV format camcorders. I use a camcorder for my son's and daughter's sporting events and with the DVD format, the slo-mo is unacceptable; with MiniDV it is smooth and clear. Caveat emptor."
5,Sony DCR-DVD308,"Excellent video camera, small, handy, reliable. Somewhat slow when reading the disk but otherwise a very good choice. Good pictures"
4,Nearly Perfect......,"This is a colorful and wonderous performance of the Fantastique--the sonics clearly deliver every orchestral subtlety presented by the conductor. However, one personal requirement in any performance of this piece must be a dominant presence of the kettle drums--they must be forward and loud in the last two movements. The opening of the March to the Scaffold is very tepid without the ominous proclamation of the the kettle drums; we are talking public hanging and Witches Sabbath, not a muffled premonition. The best recorded complete performance I have ever heard of the Symphony Fantastique is a golden oldie collector's item on a Remington lp by Georges Sebastian and the RIAS orchestra. It is a swirly, scary and hair raising performance. It worked for me until Minoxodil became available. CBY"
5,The Best Album Ever!,"All their fabulous hits are in this album ""Shining Star"", ""Fantasy"", ""September"" ""Boogie Wonderland"", ""After The Love Has Gone"" ""Let's Groove"". These are the all-time favourites of mine. I recommend this album if you like the selection of those songs - then it's a real bargain."
1,Polish Heart,No posso opinar a respeito do produto porque ainda no o recebi. E deveria t-lo recebido até 12 de abril. Faam alguma coisa!
2,"Amateur music, amateur performances","Edmond Dédé was a free-born Creole of color born in the 1820s in New Orleans. He moved to France and lived most of his adult life in Bordeaux, where he had an active musical life, primarily as a theatre conductor. The music on this disc is presented primarily, I imagine, because it represents music by an early African-American composer. It is primarily in the form of quadrilles, galops, waltzes and the like. One can easily imagine some of this music played at house parties or dances. Unfortunately, I can't imagine wanting to hear it more than once. And the performances themselves, although spirited, are pretty clunky.I admire Naxos for recording so much unknown American music, but I think they might have picked something better than this."
5,Still a wonderful experience even after 20 years,"I have owned this CD for many years and it is one of my favorites. Kathleen Battle's voice is probably the most lyric, beautiful soprano voice I have ever heard. Her upper range is superbly controlled, never a trace of a screech, always as light and perfect and pure as a bird's song. I have other soprano favorites also but Kathleen's voice has the most pure timbre at the high end of the scale, which sends shivers up my spine.All seven of these Mozart selections are great choices. I listen to this CD over and over. It is highly recommended, still fresh after 20 years."
5,Why I love Kathleen,"This album was the reason I fell in love with Kathleen Battle. Her voice is clean, beautiful and pure, just the right type of voice for Mozart."
2,Too much unrelated baggage,"I guess I can not agree with the previous reviewers. Although the book does have it's high points, I felt the author padded the book with too many unimportant and unrelated personal opinions. I was expecting something better. Save your money."
1,Junk,"Burned out in less than a year. A standard iron core transformer is placed in a plastic box where it can't cool properly so it burns out, exactly like the original. Looks good though!"
1,Garbage,"This is by far the worst fitting phone case I've ever seen. It doesn't even lookgood. The case makes it hard to use the buttons on the side and the bottom front of the case hangs out from the face making it dificult to turn the phone on and off. Unfortunately, I can't find another brand for this phone. Don't waste your money on this. A scratched phone looks better than one with this case."
4,Titles are mixed up,The music is great but beware that some of the pieces listed on the back of the case are out of order.
4,Dynamite comes in small packeges,"Being a fan for years, I was looking forward to getting my paws on this album. I went through a lot to finally get to it. Let's just say my loyalty forces me to say that it was worth it, but my little man won't allow me to.I think that this is a very average album, in comparison to what they have done in the past. Maybe I am a commercial junky, but the two albums that stood out for me has to be Traveling Without Moving and Funk Odyssey.But there are one or two tracks that will get that booty shaking and will feed the acid jazz/funk hunger.It is not bad, but it is not the best. Maybe Jay Kay should tap into that hat collection to see if he will find inspiration for mind blowing sound. Feel free to listen to their first single Feels Just Like It Should and Electric Mistress.So keep it up Jay and co, I believe that this is just a technical glitch"
5,DY-NO-MITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Jamiroquai has done it again with their sixth full release of ""acid jazz""/club grooves! ""Dynamite"" is a return to form after a disappointing ""Funk Odyssey""--at least to me anyway-- although, its record sells will tell otherwise! But then, this group never really puts out a bad CD. That being said, Jamiroquai front man Jay Kay still belts out tell-it-like-it-is lyrics with that rich Stevie Wonderness that I dig so much ('cept I like Jay Kay's style 100xs better than Stevie's!). The boys in the band bring 70s influenced beats and edgey dance floor grooves as usual with live instruments and tight productions. Standout tracks include Talullah, Feels Just Like It Should, Dynamite, Electric Mistress, Don't Give Hate a Chance and Seven Days. Another instanst classic from the boys in the U.K. that's--to steal the hook from that popular '70s sitcom--DY-NO-MITE!!!!!!!!!"
3,3-1/2 stars -- More like a small spark,"It seems like after the success of ""Alright"" waned (that video was always played on BET for some reason), people stopped paying attention to Jamiroquai. Still, I decided to check out their latest album, Dynamite, to see if JK and the bunch still had it.Well, it's a little hard to tell. After listening to all of their albums, I've come to the conclusion that Jamiroquai is really only JK with a revolving door backup band (New Radicals, anyone?). That isn't the real problem, however; basically, as a few other reviewers hinted at, all their songs pretty much started to sound the same after a while, thus coining the first song, ""Feels Just Like It Should"". None of the songs really sound bad (well, actually, ""(Don't) Give Hate a Chance"" is pretty cheesy), but this is basically just a safe album for Jamiroquai fans, or for fans of club/disco music.Anthony Rupert"
4,Dynamite is dynamite,"this album is pretty much combination of all the past albums(funk/rock/disco). this is their best work to date. it's a shame their label doesn't promote them better. it's usally by accident that i find out an album is about to drop. my very favorite traxs are 1,4 & 7. if you are a true fan... Pick this one up!!!"
2,Debateable,"IN comparison to the other Jamiroquai albums, this is the worst. Upon hearing that they were releasing a new album that went back to the good days of Traveling- i was like ""PIMP!!"" jamiroquai is my favorite band. i went and got it. listened to all the songs once through, and was satisfied with #2 and #5. the rest are...hmm..they just don't have the jamiroquai spice. looking at the credits, you'll see that there are all new members except Sola and Derrick. i think the real soul in Jamiroquai came from the keyboards and the bass. without that u just got this mish-mash of a cd that shouldn't have been released."
3,Practical cloning,"Though a few certifiable notches below what was their creative peak a decade before, Jamiroquai's bag of tricks have fallen from grace in an easily digestible manner."
2,Jamiroquai permanently lost in commercial limbo,"Ever since bass player Stuart Zender left the band, it has been gradually going downhill. ""Traveling Without Moving"" still breathed some influence from his great lines and songwriting, but all releases after that are actually flat and boring compared to the soulful acid jazz extravaganza of the first two albums. Especially the tracks with a house beat really make me cringe. Why does Jay Kay want to appeal to the club going masses so much? The only thing I can think of is: money.Jay Kay of course is fully entitled to go for the big buck before his time in the limelight is up. I just don't want to be witness to his musical decline anymore, so this will likely be the last Jamiroquai-album I will ever have purchased.The only reason why I give this album 2 stars instead of one is the track ""Seven Days in Sunny June"", which still breathes some of the class of Jamiroquai's glory days (although it still would have sounded better with Zender on bass)."
3,It's ok..,My boyfriend and I love Jamiroquai. We're from Charlotte NC and of course Jamiroquai's Dynomite isn't over here yet so we had to purchase it from Ebay. My favorite songs on there are Black Devil Car and Dynomite of course. Everything is ok but it just doesn't feel right. I miss the Space Cowboy/Synchronized days. Sounds like Jay and the band were experimenting which is ok but I miss all the funkiness and violins. I'm still a big fan though and I look forward to future albums.
3,Dissapointment overload,"hey! I am a REAL jamirogirl - i love jamiroquai through and through lol i have all there albums an evn met JK!!! As a fan I was basically obliged to buy dynamite. However I found it really disappointing, compared to their other stuff - i mean you can't compare dynamite to the return of the space cowboy or emergency... Jamioquai's new stuff has completley lost it's original, rich funky sound - i mean Fells.. that was so un-jamiroquai. I really wud not reccomend ne1 but this but who am I 2 say - U may like it :) therefore yh try it out I gess. A funk Oddesy was where Jamiroquai were goin off course but dynamite was not jamiroquai like at all apart from the track starchild i gess. Nothing compared to return of the space cowboy! lol cyaaa"
1,need to hang it up&stop faking the Funk,"Jamiroquai was happening back from 93-97,but the formula of Emulating 70's Era Roy Ayers,Donna Summers,Stevie Wonder&a few other folks has worn itself out. they been Grooving the same ole Groove Album,after Album without being called out on Writing a Song. Grooves are Nice&Important,but you need words&music. they haven't showed me much since about 97.a typical One trick Pony who has been faking the funk."
5,Cosmic Funk,"Jamiroquai is a psychodelic 80's funk master. This album is full of funk, crunchy bass lines, horns galore and guitars spinning out of control. What holds it all together is the drums and percussion. If you like funk music, Marvin, influenced than you will like this album. The songs are all very upbeat and you find yourself singing along when you become aquainted with the album. Its really just a guilty pleasure. The more I listen to it the more I enjoy it. I have never had any Jamiroquai before this album. A good party album for sure!"
5,The best yet!,"I have always enjoyed Jamiroquai's albums, but sometimes can only listen to so much of an album before it's too much. This one blew me away though; if you like Jamiroquai's music you will definitely not be disappointed by this one."
4,Brief subject description,"Longmans, 1953, 1st; 220 pp. Juvenile hardback. Adventures with Roger's Rangers who spied for the British Troops around Lake Champlain during the French and Indian War."
4,Not Crazy About the Zipper,"The bag does a great job of providing added protection for my silver-finish L.A. Benge and helps guard against tarnishing. The zipper always made me a bit nervous, however. Every time I would slip the horn out of the bag or put it back in, I had to take great care because the zipper could have possibly scratched the finish. I solved the problem by removing the zipper by its stitches and simply tucking the bag underneath the horn. I purchased a similar but much larger bag for my flugelhorn and solved the zipper problem the same way. Just fold the bag over to help seal up the horn inside its hard case and there are no worries."
3,good bag bad zipper,Item was what was described in the listing however the zipper actually scratched my trumpet two different places on the bell. I had to manually remove the zipper and now the bag works fine.
5,Fantastic,Fantastic album. I purchased for my 90 yr old father. he loves it and now I listen to it all the time.
5,Legacy of The King,"Nat passed away in February of 1965. He left us too soon but left us a wonderful selection of music to enjoy. I felt this remastered version might have artificial sharpness in the high frequencies but the sound is quite warm. A lot of remastered recordings from the 40's to 60's had harsh sound when compared to their vinyl counterparts. This is not a greatest hits album but a lot of them are included. The standout of missing songs for me was 'Answer Me, My Love' but I have it on other albums. 'Nature Boy' is an alternate version and works quite well. 'Day In Day Out' I've never heard before. This album has entered the top 50 Billboard charts."
2,Nat deserves better treatment!,"Nat recorded stereo versions of these songs. They are the superb recordings we all heard on the radio and fell in love with over the years. But this lame cd features many inferior, older mono recordings. Shame on Capital Records for getting it wrong, yet again. Add this to the already long list of incomplete Nat packages on the market. Why can't they do their homework and do it right? Nat deserves the loving treatment the label reserves for Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. The first half of this cd is just awful. But at least the second half is so great, you nearly forget how iratating the first has is...Truely one of the greatest male vocalists of all time, regardless of genre. ""Let's Face The Music And Dance"" is all the proof you need..."
5,Black cashmere turtleneck,"Beautiful sweater; exceeded expectation in quality for the price. Only negative note, I was not informed there would be duty charges COD from US to Canada. An additional $21.00 on top of an already high $40 shipping charge."
2,Be Forewarned,"Be forewarned....the very opening of the movie on this DVD has been truncated. The source for these transfers is evidently a program hosted by Roy and Dale in their later years. While I have no problem with the DVD's containing the intros, I did not pay for a movie that is not in its entirety...COMPLETE opening credits and all.Secondly, the source is not good either. Roan Group did a much better job with their Roy Roger movie transfers.In spite of being ""Authorized by the Roy Rogers Estate""...which made me assume this a safe purchase....these Happy Trails Theatre DVD's are anything BUT high quality."
4,Surprise Story,Read a synopsis of the story while teaching an 8th grade English class and loved it so much I wanted to watch the movie. It did not disappoint.
2,not too exciting,i have been hanbuilding and pit-firing pottery for a number of years and was not particularly impressed with this book. it might be a good source of information for beginners but it is not at all inspiring or even visually appealing. there are several other books about the techniques involved in this type of pottery production that folks should take a look at first.
2,Disappointing...,"I was thrilled with Al's first soul album in almost 30 years (""I can't stop""), and I was happy to know that he and Willie had another new effort. Unfortunately (IMO), this CD is over-produced and way too slick. The songs are uneventful, and nothing really stands out. I haven't listened to this CD since the first week I bought it. Sorry, I love Al and I have all of his music, and I hope he keeps recording, but he's capable of SO much better than this."
2,Sorry Al. I wish I had borrowed it b4 I bought it...,"I am a long time (since the 70s) Al Green devotee. And I'm just very disappointed with this cd. There are a few songs that I enjoy, but very few. I think mostly what is bothering me with this cd is that there seems to be waaaaaay too much caterwauling. Meaning screeching and hollering. Now I can certainly appreciate Al Green's enthusiam and getting into the energy of the song and I don't mind some ""outbursts"", but it is excessive on this cd and after I listened to it the first time it really got on my nerves. It isn't that I can't embrace his new recordings like some of my friends who only want to hear the old stuff. I really liked the last cd, ""I can't stop"" and I was very excited to hear that this new cd was coming out. Sorry out there to all the Al Green fans, but if you have to choose between this new cd and his last new cd ""I can't stop"" I certainly wouldn't pick this newest one."
3,Everything really is okay,"The Reverend Al Green - Everything's OK (Blue Note, 2005)Unlike other people, I enjoyed Rev. Al's last comeback album, I Can't Stop, more than this one. The only problem that I had with that album was that a few songs sounded exactly like the title track. On this album, it's even worse. A little variety in production would have made this a more enjoyable album. Al's voice is still in tip-top shape but he does resort to screaming and wailing a little too much. The only song I really enjoyed was his remake of ""You Are So Beautiful"". I'll probably have to listen to this album again to get a better feel for it but for now, Everything's OK is the most appropriate album title ever. -EJR"
3,slightly better than Average,"a Big time Al Green Fan,but His last two Albums back to doing R&B, sound dated&Uninspired. Lyrics are aight. while the Music is sharp&Polished it lacks that old Punch.while I will always Respect Willie Mitchell it's time for Al Green to truly up-date His Groove. Vocally He still has that ""It"" but the material sadly sounds like a watered down version.this Album is 2&half star to me."
5,Memphis sound is back!!!,"Al Green has always been a favorite of mine.I grew up with soul music as a staple.I slipped this CD in and I thought I was back in the 70'sHis style has not changed at all,I was impressed that he can still(with a little push) hit those same high notes he did when I was a young man.If you want to go back to the better times than this CD is for you."
3,This one lost some magic...,"I am an adult and a huge Harry Potter fan at that. I must admit that I was disappointed with this movie. It strayed from the book so much that key elements were missing. If you hadn't read the Prisoner of Azkaban you wouldn't understand a majority of the movie and what made the book so special. Everything was out of whack and sequence. Fellow reviewers have already mentioned particular instances of which I speak. The cinematography of the first two movies is beyond amazing. This new director tried too hard to make the Prisoner of Azkaban ""spooky"" by making the entire movie grainy. It bothered me. The first two movies looked so magical and this movie didn't even come close that capturing that same essence. The Prisoner of Azkaban was by no means a horrible movie, but it certainly wasn't as good as it should have been."
2,Skipped scenes,"Loved the movie but it skipped at the same spot all the time. The scene where the giant spider come out of the wardrobe would stop at mid-transformation. I would manually skip to next three scenes to continue watching movie. Other HP movies purchase through Amazon were fine, this was the only faulty one."
2,Ulimate Editions 3 & 4 Not Extended,"Obviously, a Harry Potter movie cannot be bad, but I was so disappointed in the Ultimate Editions 3 & 4 that I purchased thinking I was buying the extended versions. I do not use the extra stuff included in these movies. I only buy them for the movie. I already owned all the movies in blu-ray when thye began releasing them in the Ultimate Edition. I read somewhere that this edition was the extended version so I ordered the first two. They were slightly disappointing since they only had the extensions we have been seeing for years on ABCFM-TV but they were, at least, extended. Thinking I would get more of the same, I ordered the next two releases, Ultimate Editions 3 & 4. I was shocked to see they did not even have the couple of extra scenes shown on TV. I feel like I was overcharged for the same movie I already owned. I don't think I will be buying any more ""Ultimates"" unless things change."
4,This Film Is Gonna Be GREAT! I Know It!,"Wow, this film sure looks great!I've seen the trailer lots of times and I can't wait for it to come out in the theaters. It looks like they really did a great job with this film. From what I saw in the trailers they pretty much stuck to the book. There were lots of scenes there that I recognized from the book. The movie looks SO EXCITING! I can't wait till June 4th! I'm glad they put in the part when Hermione punches Draco in the face. That was cool! I hope there will be more trailers soon and the poster sure looks exciting!"
2,Harry Potter,I fear that they will ruin the third Harry Potter film for they are going to take away the wizard robes and put them in normal clothes that muggles would wear . This new director will remove the wizardry feel from the movie and take away the difference between the muggles and wizards .
3,Definitely not the book,"I was somewhat disappointed in this film. The book was my favorite of the series to date, but the movie deviated too far from the book. Dumbledore's personality was completely different, which doesn't make sense in the continuity of the series. I don't know why the new director thought it necessary to change the grounds of Hogwarts. And they all but left Maggie Smith out, playing Professor McGonagill. So much was eliminated concerning the history of Harry's father and his three closest friends which was supposed to have set the stage for the sequels. I heard J.K. Rowling say in an interview that she really liked this movie and the changes the director made. I can't imagine why, since there was so much difference between the two, often in key areas."
4,Not as good as I thought,"Okay, first off I DO like the movie. It's just that I'm a HUGE fan, and the movie was a total dissapointment. I couldn't believe how much they DIDN'T go by the book. Not that I didn't enjoy it though. It's a Harry Potter film, and no matter how different it is from the book, I still like it. (Only because it's Harry Potter lol) Anyways, I'd rent it before you buy it. Because you might not like it.*I gave it four stars just because I'm a fan*"
3,DOOM!!!,fear he who must not be named!!! the time of vengeance is upon us!!! take up your arms and attack! now!! before his wrath causes our untimely doom!!! DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOMDOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sigh....this movie left me bored...so...yeah....
2,Not worthy of it's name,"I, for one, was extremely disappointed with this film. I think that the third book was my favorite and, personally, this movie seemed to slaughter it.First off, why did the cast the actor who is the definitely of sleasy and villanous as Lupin? I think that was maybe the most horribly cast character in the history of film.Sirius is cast alright, a little fatter than I expected but still better than Lupin.The computer graphics are good, except for that final scene by the lake with sirius, which I won't discuss much further.The scene where Hermoine punches Draco is cool but it kinda came off as a desperate attempt to save a crippled film.Harry feints almost every other scene. I'm not sure where that came from.The were-wolf is a shameful animation, he looks far too gangly and slim to by a horrifying monster.Overall, the plot line is skewered as well and I would never dream of suggesting this movie for harry potter fans."
5,No one can stop Harry Potter!!!!!!,"The first two Harry Potter films are great, but this one will be simply P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!!! Who saw the teaser knows what i'm talking about, Afonso Cuaron will take the Harry Potter films a step further. A more modern style, with more muggle clothes, new hogwarts clothes, Michael Gambon will do well on steping Richard Harris's shoes as Dumbledore. The dementors are fantastic, Sirius Black is perfect. The three lead actors are back, Daniel Radcliffe is THE Harry Potter, Rupert Grint is fantastic as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson is sectacular as Hermione. This film will probably be the most sucessfull film of 2004, as a fanatic Harry Potter fan I just can't wait to see this movie. In June 4th, something wicked this way comes..."
4,"Wonderful movie, slow delivery","My son has wanted this movie for a long time. I bought it for his birthday through Amazon. Easy to purchase. However, the estimated delivery time was off. We received it a week after expected and after his birthday. He still loved it!"
2,HP and the Prisoner of Asskissin',Stunning cinematography and set design can't save this film from being unbearably boring. It's incredibly sad that crap like this has such mass appeal. Talk about pandering to the lowest common denominator ...
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Chris Columbus should have directed this, and I will not see another HP film in the theater that is directed by anyone else.So many things are wrong with this film that it would take nearly an hour to list them all.Awful, just awful. Gary Oldman and Emma Thompson could not save it either.What was Curon thinking!?I will not own this film either. I was so let down."
4,eh,"Ok so i was as happy that the third movie was comming out as everyone else. I really enjoyed the first two movies and was sure the third could only be better. But i was wrong. I thought this was the worst of the three films. I would like them to go back to the other director and do a better job of following the books. I didn't see how anyone who hadn't read the book could follow the movie. I would still recommend that you go see the movie to have an opinion for yourself. If you have not read the book yet please go see the movie first and i think you may enjoy it more.Also, i gave it a 4 because i don't think anyone could mess up Harry Potter enough to merit a 3."
2,Azcaban- Real let down,"If you loved the book and wanted to see it followed and not butchered do not go see this movie. Key scenes from different chapters were just combined in confusing incomplete context with deep lack of plot. Vital information that let's you follow the story is missing. Too much time was spent on scenes that were inconsequential, added in just for show, and thoroughly unnecessary. I love the books but if this is the direction the new movies are going to take with different directors I don't think I could bare to watch another one done with so much lack of fan appeal as this one was...I don't think the director even read the book.example (Harry did not receive the Firebolt until the very end scene which does not have the students on the Hogwart's express so no owl sent by Sirius)"
1,False Advertising of actual product!,"I ordered this DVD twice and both times recieved the wrong edition. What you think you're ordering is a 2 Disc Widescreen version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. What you actually recieve is a 1 disc full screen version, that's english and french (clearly a Canadian product). When I informed customer service the first time they said they would ship me a corrected order, but again I recieved the wrong version. When I contacted them a second time they were unable to correct my order, but have kept the product open. WARNING - if you purchase this you will not recieve a 2 disc widescreen product!"
2,2 and 1/2 stars,"First off, I was intending a creepy version of the Harry Potter movies. That's not what I got. It was supposed to be scary and very creepy. Well, it wasn't. This movie would have been a lot better if it would have been rated PG-13. That would have made a good interpretation of the book. First off, the 3rd book was the best one. It was excellent. But, this movie somehow managed to ruin the whole book and everything for me. This movie is very weird and really dark. I didn't like this peculiar interpretation of the book with lots of strange moments where I was scratching my head, thinking, what the heck?????This movie is weird especially thanks to the wierd bus driver. The movie was also boring to me and after a while, it lost my interest. Sure the visuals were great, but I can't say the same for the strange, boring movie."
1,What Happened?!,"It looks like Warner Bros is taking Harry Potter in the same direction as the Batman and Matrix franchises. I thought maybe our theater's film was messed up since the color and picture quality was so bad, but from what I understand, that was intentional. I guess Goblet of Fire will be about a 90 minute movie and in black in white. I only hope that WB stops with Goblet and lets New Line and Peter Jackson pick up the remaining 3 movies!"
1,Worst movie ever! The book beats the heck out of it!,"This movie's pace was too fast, and it did not have the same flow as the other two. I am glad this guy is not going to do any other Harry Potter Movies soon. He edited out the some very important parts. The book keeper who had to go get it for Harry Potter's friends. The fighting monster books would have been exciting to see, and some other parts too."
4,From a pleasantly surprised reader-,"The latest edition to the Harry Potter movie series has been the most view-worthy. Alfonso Cuaron brings an elegant artistry to the third film that Chris Columbus was sadly lacking in the first two. The cinematography is interesting, the acting remarably convincing, and the score positively exhilerating. Truly, this film surpassed all my expectations. Some complain that the movie left too much out, but frankly thats ridiculous. Cuaron captured the spirit of the book with incredible dexterity, and I may point out that while Columbus remained technically faithful, the overall energy of the book was lost. I highly recommend this movie to the average muggle but especially to devoted Harry Potter fans."
1,I dont know what happened,"I have read this book at least 30 times so seeing the movie shouldnt have confused me as much as it did. I cant imagine what a person who hasnt read the book would think. The movie makes no sense, I dont understand why the screenwriter and director left out so many plot points, but found time to put in pointless sceenes with shrunken heads, harry deep in thought or harry walking through the woods talking to lupin(that especially makes no sense for lupin to spend so much time with harry. I know he did in the book, but I dont recall them having deep heart to heart talks. Most people arent that close with their teachers.)All in all I just dont like this movie, it will go on my list of the worst movies Ive seen. Not because it is that terrible, but the book is so incredibly good, I cant understand how this came from it."
4,"The best ""Harry Potter"" yet","A far darker and more mature film, The Prisoner of Azkaban is proof that the Harry Potter franchise is growing up.Based on the book of the same name, this third entry in the Harry Potter epic follows Harry during his third year at Hogwarts. The twist this time around is that there has been an escape at the heavily guarded wizard prison of Azkaban, and the escapee is supposedly after Harry.Far more intense than previous entries, this movie is more appropriate for the preteen and older crowd. ""Azkaban"" also showcases one of the growing problems with the franchise - the stories are becoming too long and involved for a 2 hour movie. For those who have read the book, a great deal had to be cut and condensed to accommodate the timeframe. However, none of these issues keep ""Azkaban"" from being an excellent film.Recommended for 12-year and older fantasy and Harry Potter fans."
4,"THIRD TIME, A CHARM!","I thought the first 2 Harry Potters were pretty good,but this one was definetly, the best of the bunch!It had alot of action, and was very interesting."
3,"Not the best out of the 3, but..","It was a good movie. It's not the best of the three so far. The ""kids"" are getting older and that kinda takes the novelty of them being kids out. They really should stop here. But, age aside, this one didn't have as many curious creatures as the previous two had. It was a decent movie, just nothing interesting like the previous two. I wish I would've seen it before I bought it."
2,Will entertain...the first time you watch it.,"I watched this when it opened, and I thought it was ok. But a couple weeks later, I watched again. I was a little dissapointed to find that the jokes weren't THAT funny, and the acting wasn't THAT great. I also realized my favorite parts from the book hadn't made the cut into the movie and the scenes were all out of order. Although Alfonso Cuarón did a nice job of piecing the scenes together. I wouldn't recommend buying this movie, but instead renting it IF you haven't seen it before."
3,Not good for people who haven't read the books,"I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan! But I don't read the books. When I saw the third movie, I kept getting lost/confused. Was there even ANY Quidditch? The first and second ones were easy to understand to those who haven't read the books and it was detailed. I was especially confused near the end in the lake scenes--it could've been more explained. It led me to sign an official petition to make the fourth movie very long or split it up into different parts or something along those lines. But the characters played their roles out very well, I believe. And it's hard to keep your attention span on it seeing that it was moving along very fast and so you would have to watch every scene thinking about what scene just flew by."
1,Harry Potter and the prisoner of century theaters,"I expected more of this movie. I knew there wasnt voldemort, but it still could have been better.( Voldemorts the one that makes it best). I don't reccomend this movie to anybody. I've seen better crap in the public restroom than this! Even harry potter 1 and 2 is better than this!Avoid it at all costs!"
2,Very Disappointing,"There were several things very wrong and left out of the movie that I felt were crucial to the overall plot Just a few things are:-They never explained that Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were Lupin, Petigrew, Sirius, and James-They left out the Quidditch Cup-They never explained about Lupin's werewolf potion. Hermoine says ""Professor Lupin didn't take his potion tonight!!"" or something along those lines. People who haden't read the books would be confused.Instead of including these plot points, they wasted their time on ""artsy"" shots, shrunken heads, and bad acting. Not to mention the screenwriter probably had never even read the books. Don't waste your money on this movie... It's not worth it."
2,Quality of tape,"While the movie was very good the quality of the tape while playing was not very good.Unlike other tapes I purchased from Amazon, which were excellent,this tape was poor in quality.I played another tape from Amazon on the same VCR right after and the quality was excellent so it is not my VCR.Probably a manufacturers defect which you can do nothing about.It wont stop me purchasing other products from Amazon as the quality of your products is very reliable."
4,A good set-up for the next part of the story,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the weakest of the Harry Potter movies so far, but then the book was as well. It was mainly a set-up for the real fireworks in ""Goblet of Fire."" It also worked as a way to get Sirius Black into the story.As for the film, I don't care for Michael Gambon as the new Dumbledore. That said, the movie is quite good. I really liked the portrayal of Professor Lupin. The special effects are wonderful, and the magical world is richly portrayed."
2,why pick Alfonso Cuaron?,"I love the Harry Potter books and the movie 1 and 2 but this is the worst one so far. I had high hopes for this move but it was a big let down. I know they had enough money to do more and put in alot more than they did. The only reason why i gave it a 2 star is because of the one person, Alfonso Cuaron he has not even made one good movie and I know movies very well. The only movies he should do is home movies! I just hope they dont cut alot out like the they did in part 3. Thanks for taking your time in reading this."
3,eehhhh,"Not bad, but not particularly great either. This is not TRUE fantasy. It's more like adventure. I have seen better villains too........perhaps some that I'VE had to create with my MASTER COMPUTER. If you want TRUE fantasy, watch ""LEGEND OF EARTHSEA"" on the Sci-Fi channel, or rent or buy ""BIG FISH"", or the ""LORD OF THE RINGS"" series. That's all I can think of right now that I can really recommend.Voldemort isn't even in this! The REAL villains are not all that good. BOTTOM LINE; If those critics call this film ""more mature"", then that's what they need to be. {Something else I'd recommend for good fantasy is ""SLEEPY HOLLOW"" or any other spectacular film by Tim Burton}."
4,Expecto Patronum,"for blu ray reviewers, order of phoenix is better in video and sound quality. but prizoner of azkaban is a movie that you like to watch over and over again. Nice colors when harry is saving the big bird."
5,All perfect!,"This is a real movie and not a book with special effects, and that explains why they do not show everything from the book.The Marauder's Map was excellent, Sirius is a little crazy, just like in the book. I liked very much the werewolf, the dementors were perfect and Buckbeak was just like my dog Martin, always searching for food.I wish Alfonso will stay for the next movies and I want them to keep making real movies and not, as said, books with special effects.(...)"
4,Good Movie,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the best movie in the wizard franchise so far. Very entertaining!
2,"Excellent film, Fun extras, Horrid interviewer","Given the effort and hype that comes with ""special edition"" DVDs, I just have to make a comment about the Interviews with Johnny Vaughan on the second DVD. But first, for those interested in the movie, it is great - 5 stars.I give the DVD 2 stars because of the Johnny Vaughan. I have rarely ever seen such awful interviews. Just one example: unbelievably, one of the main questions for almost every actor is ""how many girls"" (he even uses the offensive term ""birds""...) have you been able to seduce thanks to your fame from the HP films. Even when the boy who plays the Dursley kid states early on that no one recognizes him in the street, Vaughan still asks (maybe even twice if I'm not mistaken) the same stupid, sexist question. (The pathetic attempts at humour using the Shrunken Head are also incredibly annoying.) What a lost opportunity.This is of course no reason not to by the DVD, but Warner Brothers should be embarrassed."
4,Harry Potter is now 13,"I am a Harry Potter fan and was eager to see the film, although I was dissapointed to see it rushed. It left out alot of parts, and people who haven't read the book would be totally lost."
3,The Book was soooooooooooooooooooooo much better!,"The book was by far my favorite of the Harry Potter series so I was so excited to see the movie, but I was sadly disappointed. The film makers left out a HUGE part that was in the book that I was most excited about seeing. (For those who are have not read the 3rd book I don't want to ruin it for you) I can though understand that the movie would have ended up being 4 hours long, but Gone With the Wind is 4 hours long, and people could have definitely sat through Harry Potter for that long.Aside from what I didn't like about the movie, I love seeing how all the actors have grown up as compared to the first movie. Even Draco Malfoy is looking pretty cute. lol :)"
2,Bring Back Chris!,"I saw the first two movies and was greatly pleased at how much they were like the books. However, this third movie was not impressive. It lacks spirit and luster. It did not stay true to the book, left out some very important parts, and went as far as changing parts of the story. The cinematoghrapy was dull and the magic of the first two films was non-existent. If you never read the books and saw this movie, you would be lost. I sincerely hope that they bring back the original film crew for the fourth movie or they may lose fans. Just to let you know, I'm not a kid, but a grandmother of 12 and truly a Harry Potter fan."
5,It is the best in my opinion,"The Prisoner of Azkaban is the best of the lot in so far (thats only my opinion). I hope the movie lives up to the book, and i hope they get Sirius Black down. He is my favorite."
2,The Magic is Gone!,"What a disappointment. Knowing that it was most peoples favorite book and then the movie is lacking the meat of the story. At least they will have a new director for ""Goblet of Fire."""
3,Where's the magic?,"Much like a dementor's kiss, Alfonso Cuarón has sucked the soul out of what should have been the best movie of the Harry Potter series. He has cut down the story to the bare bones and washed out all of the colorful elements that bring this series to life. I hope Mike Newell brings back the magic for Goblet of Fire."
2,WE NEED A NEW DIRECTOR,"Oh My Gosh!!! This movie was poor! Why in the world would J.K. Rowling let them hack all that stuff out!!! If you ask me, I think Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban should be re-made into a film. They took to much out or changed it, for instance, they jammed the firebolt broom to the very end!!!! WHY?? Hopefully the same director as the first two will be directing the film Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which will hit theaters on November 18th, 2005!!! Although it was poorly written, the actors still did a wonderful job, as usual."
2,I Was Disapointed With This One,"The third book is my second favorite in the series and I don't think this movie did a very good job of representing it. It seemed to have no plot to it, more like jumping from one thing to another and not explaining anything. Especially when talking about the Marauder's Map and The Grim that Harry sees. I have read the book multiple times and still all I could understand from this movie was that Sirius Black wanted to kill Harry. The ending did not explain the relationship between the makers of the Marauder's Map and Harry, or hardly anything else."
1,Poor production !!!!,"Compared to the first two Harry Potter films, the third was a very poor comparison to the book. A great many of the important details were left out of the movie, especially at the beginning, that are essential to set the stage for the plot. This movie completely fails to capturing the magical mystical charm of Hogwarts; Dumbledore's demeanor doesn't project the same patriarchal figure as usual, Malfoy's appearance isn't quite as wicked, and the students are often seen out of their regular school uniforms which detracts from the strict boarding school atmosphere that the book portrays. I certainly hope that future Harry Potter movies will reflect the same quality as the books -- otherwise they should stop making the movies.Very disappointing!!!"
3,"Not enough there, To much missing",Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a good book. The movie left out alot of important stuff. Harry got his Firebolt in the middle of the book. Also the movie didn't explain about the nicknames. For example they didn't say Padfoot was James' nickname. Harry never got the letter to say Sirius was safe. Ron also never got Pigwigeon from Sirius. McGonagal taking the firebolt to have it checked for jinxes was skipped. There was not alot of Quidditch training or games. I think the movie could have been alot better.
2,Two-faced,"This movie, while I admit the actual theatrical performance was good, did not resemble the book as most people have said. I think that if you make a movie about a book, it should be more like the book. The director for the movie added too many different aspects that did not fit the Harry Potter storyline. I loved the books, but the movie needs some definite help. People have said that the Lord of the Rings movies are too long, but they follow the story which is why they are so loved. This edition of Harry Potter could have been much more loved by the public if it followed the book a bit more closely. The movie was a good movie, but it was not a good Harry Potter movie."
3,"good movie, not exactly faithful","If you're looking for a great match to the third book of the Harry Potter series, this movie may just make you angry. If you realize, however, that the book is much to long to include everything in a reasonable movie and just try to look at them as two different stories altogether, then you will probably enjoy it. There was a new director for this movie, and he felt things like Hogwarts grounds needed to be changed. It's a completely different feel than the first two movies, which I found to be quite irksome. Other than that though I really enjoyed it, and I don't regret my purchase at all."
4,harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban,"how comes the movie ""harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban"" will come out on the 4th of june 2004 and not this year november 2003?why is it taken so long to come out?why?"
2,Connect The Dots..If you read the books...,"I have read 1-5 of the books and found Sorcerers Stone & Chamber of Secrets films had captured the magic of HP. However, I cannot say the same for Prisoner of Azkaban. I took my 2 1/2 year old 2x to see this film and he loves it as he loves the other ones, however I found it chopped up, with no flow. If you had not read the books, you'd be totally lost, no mention of the time manipulator that Hermoine uses etc. However the Dementors & the Hippogriff effects where just as I pictured. I hope they will reconsider Christopher Columbus for future HP projects."
2,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,The movie was a discrace to the book! They butchered the book! DONT go out and spend your money on it. Wait until it comes out on video
3,The worst sequel of Harry Potter: a true dissappointment,"Readers: I underline in this brief article, that this third saga insults to the author, J.k. Rowling, becuase it aparts from the original story, by minuscle details, such as Bucrbear, which is hypograph, not a hybrid, due there is great difference between both of them.Another mayuscle mistake is that the Huflephuf's searcher is designed her as man and that's a big default in the Fourth Saga.Finally, one of the worst mistakes, was the ending, because it designs that the finish should have ended in the train when the litle lechuza Pigwiggeon and not with Harry in his fire's arrow.Good cinematography and worthable cast makes the rest but I guess definitively this entry was not the most inspired, pitifully."
3,Could have been better,"PoA just wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I'm not saying it was BAD, just not as good as the other two. I do like the new, darker, more mature mood the new director brought, and especially Draco's new hairdo, but I think they cut too much out. It is the longest book, and the shortest movie. I know they were worried about it being too long, but it could have been a little longer than it was. It did not include some of the important points that the books made, and if you have not read the books, you might be a bit lost. However, I did enjoy it, and I DO recommend buying it."
3,it was dissapointing,"I walked out of the theater like someone had punched me in the gut. Or like the air had been let out of my tires. I am a fanatic fan. I have read and re-read the entire series. This movie just wasn't done well. I didn't like the new doumbledore. I didn't like the new set location castle hagrids hut ect... However, the kids are getting better at acting. I had waited over two years and I almost left the theater in tears. They left way to much out and people who haven't read the books have to clue as what is going on.... just my thoughts!"
1,Intellect,"First of all, the lack of an extended cut takes away any chance of this item being a worthwhile purchase. Now the movie itself also has many flaws. Besides a terrible artistic style, and omitting many important scenes it also suffers from terrible dialogue pacing. Too many conversations happen at a Gilmoresque pace that shouldn't. Harry Potter is not a quick thinking character outside of physical conflict. If he is being told important, complex information he needs to stand there and absorb the information for a moment before responding. This same issue happens on a much lesser scale to most characters in the movie. The only characters who benefit from this pace are the Weasley Twins. The silver tongued quick witted bamboozlers work very well with the pacing of this movie."
1,Turn Off Your TV and Read,The book is so much more well put together then the movie. The movie is choppy at best. I'm a big fan of the harry potter books but the movies have frankly dispointed me. It leaves out key elements of the story and changes the plot around. It was confusing and harder to follow then the book. I really think people should just stick to the book or the books on tape because they are awesome. If i could give this movie a 0 I would! I wanted to just fall asleep during it. This is a sell out at best!
1,Poor movie,This movie was too long that left me wanting it to end so I could turn it off. This doesn't have anything of the first 2 movies and that was a huge disappointment. Hogwarts no longer looks like a school but a gothic castle. I lost interest in the mystery and found the characters lacked depth. Maybe the director should read the books and watch the previous films before making this one.
3,disappointing,"really a shame. this should have been the best one so far, it has the best plot. but instead of the wit and the dialogue we got actors looking serious and lots of music to substitute for the development of their emotions"
4,A PRISONER OF POTTER,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is by far the most expensive and best cinematic presentation of the third movie installment of J.K. Rowling's continuing children's book series.The actors have matured a bit, and so has their acting with each movie (I believe all three of the main characters to have promising futures for their roles in the movies). The first two movies, while still magical, lacked somewhat. The feeling was that of an over-budgeted BBC TV special.Though I love the books, I can't help but feel the movies deserve better treatment. I am a fan nonetheless and am thrilled with the excitement of the upcoming ""...Goblet of Fire"". Hopefully, our young actors will hit it on the nose. But what do I know. I'm just a silly Muggle."
5,THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!,"I absolutely LOVE this movie!!! I've seen it so many times I know all the lines and I also have the soundtrack, which I listen to the music and say the lines along with the music.This movie is my favorite of all the Harry Potter films, followed by The Goblet of Fire. Alfanso Curoun did an excellent job of directing this film.SO BUY THIS MOVIE because it is very entertaining and fun to watch. (and Daniel Radcliffe isn't bad either. :-)what can i say?? im a Harry Potter FREAK and I <3 it!!!"
5,HP,This is the third year for Harry Potter at Hogwarts School of Withcraft and Wizardry. So far the books and the movies just keep on getting better! I don't think that this is a good books for little kids but for teenagers or adults it is the best! And do not forget to check out the other Harry Potter books and movies! They are really worth it!
3,Harry Potter 3,"I thought the movie could be better. Why did Harry get the Firebolt last? Like all the other movies, this movie seems to be missing some important scenes like there is only one Quidditch match in the movie.It seems to me Hermione wears the same outfit throughout the entire movie."
5,Probably Won't Have Too Many Extra Scenes,"I read in a recent Entertainment Weekly article that there was so much cutting of the film before they even started filming that some scenes that you may expect to see in the extras probably will not be there due to the time crunch.However, the movie, in my opinion, was done beautifully. For the amount of time that it did run, it all flowed smoothly and the cinematography of the whole movie is excellent because of the great new director in this film, Alfonso Cuaron. I totally recommend this movie, although there might not be too many deleted scenes.www.blackforests.com"
2,Well acted but plot lacking,"while i thought the movie was good, i didn't think it was great or spectacular.Yes Harry and his friends have grown up and are more mature and are dealing with more mature situations, but where is the feeling from the previous movies and yes i'll have to hand it to them the acting was much better in this third installment but my whole problem with this movie is it doesn't excite you like the last 2 and it doesn't have a very asrousing plot and I was very bored through alot of the movie. So all and all a good movie with good acting but the excitment of it was very dull."
1,Harry Potter - Ultimate Edtions,"Dont waste your money.How many people want to pay 40 or 50 for almost nothing new.Why would make the first 2 extended and not the next 2,so people would buy them thinking they were getting extended versions when they were not.They are a scam."
5,Harry Potter Prisoner of askaban was Fantastic,"To me this movie was better than the first. Not saying that they were not good cause they were. But I was kepted to my seat to see what happened every minute. Enjoyed it when they went time traveling. That was just great, and I enjoyed seeing Malfoy getting socked by Hermione. That just's made the show. And when Hermione kepted showing up in class and Ron was beside hisself because he could not figure out how she got there so quickly. And when they saved the hypocrite. That was also the nicest and most courageous thing that they did in the movie. Yes I would rate it a 10 star if I could. Keep up the good , great work Lady's and gentlemen."
2,Not what it could have been,"If you read the book, you will be most likely be quite upset with this movie. You will be sitting there just hoping for more in each scene... but it just won't come. I understand the need for poetic liscence... but when you simply rewrite entire portions of it, and leave out KEY parts... come on. Hey... who are wormtail, moonie, padfoot and prongs anyway? Who won the quidditch cup? That new broom of Harry's seemed to have made it there with no problem, isn't any teacher curious who gave it to him? I bet if you watch the movie, you won't know the answer to most of these questions. If you are just watching the movie without reading the book, you could enjoy it as a well cast, and well designed movie. It just isn't the same without Richard Harris as Dumbledore."
4,Makes those other HP movies look like crap,"For all those people who complain about Alfonso Cuaron cutting out a lot of the book. So what.This film is a great film. Alfonso Cuaron made he wanted to make. Let's see you try to make a Harry Potter movie. I doubt you can.Alfonso Cuaron told the story that he wanted to tell. In a movie you can't have everything the book had. It would just be a long, boring movie.Also, some thigs work in a book, but don't work in a film. If you put those in it would just make a long, boring mess.Books are different from movies. You can't compare movies to books. Movies are completely different. Movies need to be considered seperate from books. Movies need to be by themselves. Those who can't accept that should not be allowed to watch movies."
5,This Movie Rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Anyone who does not love this movie is CRAZY!!! I mean sure the set was changed but what does that have to do with the movie? I mean GET A GRIP PEOPLE!People have said they were very dissapionted with Sirius and Remus,but how can you say they were terrible?Sirius seemed like a very loving person towards Harry and even Remus.Remus the same way with Harry.Anyway the story is AWESOME.I have seen this movie 7 times and it has not gotten boring.So buy this movie today.Trust me you won't be sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,totally confused,Bring back the previous director. Not nearly as good as the previous movies. I thought the story line was confusing even though I read the book. If you had not read the book you would have been totally confused. The scenes seemed to be choppy and out of sequence and didn't make a lot of sense. I am a true Harry Potter fan but I was very disappointed after waiting so long for it's release. I hope Ms. Rowling will take control and see that this doesn't happen again.
3,An integral variable is missing here,"Compared to the previous two Potter films, Azkaban is superior in direction, script, scenery, cinamatography, visual effects, and acting. Alas it is also less entertaining and somewhat lifeless. Perhaps this is due to poor editing, as the story doesnt flow as seemlessly as the first two pictures. the ending seemed very rushed as well. The 3rd installment in the series of film adaptations lacks heart."
3,A complete disappointment,Since when is Albus Dumbledore a hippie? The new Dumbledore's attire looked so sloppy and grungy...and don't get me started on that little hat! There was absolutely nothing respectable about him. He looked as though he was a regular on Knockturn Alley. And since when did Hogwarts have a huge clock? Director dude... stick to the book! This movie was way too short and a complete let down. Thank goodness they're getting a new director.
2,Prisoner of Azkaban is Overrated!!!,"First of all I am huge Harry Potter fan. I read all the books and seen all the movies. I don't get why people say Prisoner of Azkaban is best one?!! No it is not Chamber of Secrets and both parts of Deathly Hallows are the best ones. This movie does follow parts of the book, but does not follow it really good. Everyone was good in the movie except Ron. It looks like another British Actor who looks like him took his place and acts like if he didn't know who Ron is. Any time I see this movie or hear about it it puts me in a bad mood. The ones who like this movie are either people who haven't read the books or regular people. If you are huge a Harry Potter fan you will be disappointed and just read the book. If you're haven't read the books then you might like the movie."
3,not bad,"I'm a little disappointed with the casing for this DVD, there's a disc on the inside front cover and inside back cover with nothing else. It seems a little cheep to me for a special edition case. There's nothing wrong with the movie and it does come with a pamphlet but overall it seems a bit cramped since the first disc ends up behind the booklet slot."
2,Could have been so much better...,"Okay, since there are almost a 1000 posts all I really want to say is that it really, really bothered me that they weren't wearing their robes throughout most of the movie. It distorted my ""suspension of disbelief"". That and the sets were not like what was described in the book. I mean, come on, where in the HP series does Harry have to go down a long bridge and rocky crags to get to Hagrid's hut? They also could have had more Hagrid and Snape scenes. I am such a fan of the series and I just felt so let down by this movie."
2,Cheap packaging.,Awesome movie. BUT VERY CHAEP PACKAGING. Attention collectors the packaging of this movie is different from the first two Harry Potter. Why????? Warner did not give any good care on this one cause they knew that the consumers would buy it anyway to complete the collection. BAD MARKETING!!!!
1,where is the extended?,"I like so many others saw ""ultimate edition"" and having bought the first two expected the extended edition of 3 and 4. Well dummy me for thinking that way. if you have already purchased these movies on Blu ray don't bother with the same movie again. There is no extended version in these sets. I was hoping that 4 would finally make sense but alas I am left with the travisty that was Mike Newels vision. It is sad that Warner Brothers let us down. They, and Amazon, should do the right thing and send us all the extended editions like we all expected. I have read several reviews that noted an advertisement stating all ultimate editions would be extended. If this is true someone please post that ad. We can get Warner brothers for false advertising. Come on Warners and Amazon. Do the right thing for the fans."
2,Ultimate edition of Harry Potter 3 and 4,"I am also very very disappointed that this ultimate editions do not have the extra minutes that 1 and 2 have. That is the only reason I purchased them because I too have bought them in regular movie, blu ray and now extended and I just spent 60.00 for the same movies 3 and 4. I can't even send them back because I will be deducted half of the cost of the 3rd movie because I opened it before I found out it was not extended. Very very disappointed."
2,A disappointment,"Despite coaxing some superior acting out of Daniel Radcliff (Harry), the new director's take on the series lacks consistency and charm. Every new director wants to make a change, but in this case the changes have amounted to stripping the richness from the movie and reducing it to a rather bleak (and simplistic) format. There is almost no Hogwarts background, the acting from the other main characters is trite and sneering, and overall I was left wondering why on earth Warner Brothers chose Alfonso Cuarón to direct the movie. Change for the sake of it is pointless. The new Dumbledore seems to have decided to stress the first four letters of his name, and the stock villain Draco Malfoy has transformed here into a stupid leering simpleton. The result is that there's no dramatic tension of any kind. Although everyone seems to have raved about the results, this reviewer found it flat, badly-paced, lacking in charm and frankly not worth seeing a second time. Bring back Chris Columbus!"
2,Another poor quality version,"This is a poor quality reproduction, not much better than DVD quality. Really disappointing I thought. I hope they've improved it since I bought my copy."
4,love the limited editions,these limited ones were supposed to be sold at target but good luck finding them there or on there web site.I have enjoyed watching these and adding them to my collection.
4,Good movie,"This isn't one of my favorites of the Harry Potter series, but I like Gary Oldman. There are a couple twists that make this one worth your watching."
4,HP Rocks!,The package harry potter 3: the prisoner of azkaban came in was very well wrapped. It did not seem to be bruised in any way.
2,No extended versions??,"I'm a total fan of both the Harry Potter books and the movies. I purchased the first two Ultimate Editions primarily to have the extended versions. I was always frustrated that they didn't originally put them in the first DVD's (other than the individual clips) but they would insert the extra footage when they played the movies on tv. When I learned the ultimate editions were coming out for the 3rd and 4th movies I was overjoyed UNTIL I heard that they are not including the extended cuts. Hello?? Isn't that what the ""Ultimate Editons"" are all about?? Needless to say I will not be purchasing these."
3,Best Book Worst Movie,"I thought the movie was unorganized and seemed thrown together. Many key points were left out especially Prof Lupin's parts. It would have been better to make a 3 hr movie and leave out unimportant scenes.Actors are still good, probably better than last film.There was no vibrant color in the movie. All scenes have a gray tone or copper hue. What was that all about? I liked this the least of the three."
4,One of My Favorite Harry Potter Movies,"I love the time warping aspect and the ""kids"" in this movie are at the age I picture them in the books. The visual look is wonderful as they are in all the Harry Potter movies and I've probably watched this over 10 times now so you can (obviously) tell I love this movie! I never end up watching any of the extras because I never find any of them that interesting, so on that count minus one star. The movie itself is a big thumbs up."
4,This is a great movie,"This is one of the best movies I ever watched.For an old vhs,it is still just as good as a DVD."
5,It's has an artistic feel to it.,This is one of my favorite harry potter movies. I like hoe the director made the movie feel and look darker than the second one. I'm also glad that I bought this DVD because they don't sell the double disk one. I try looking for it in stores but they only sell the single disk. And this one is the original released DVD with the two disk.
3,"Better director, but not as good...","The first two movies truly had me enchanted but I had one slight problem with them...The director. His lack of camera work had me driven up the wall by the end of the film. This movie on the other hand was brilliantly shot. Beautiful scenery and many scenes where the camera goes straight through windows *shudders at the beautiful thought*. The script on the other hand was differant...The first two had both the same major plot line and I was definately hoping for something more in this film and I didnt get like many suggested. I was told that it got much more dark. I do not agree. Camera work is everything which is what makes me give the first two a 4 star (would have given it five if they had THIS directore). But this film has so little attachment to the charecters that I almost have no desire to find out what happens next. Only watch it if you have time just so you can catch what goes on between ""Chamber"" and ""Goblet""..."
3,People who love the books may be disappointed,"It was a good movie and I fully intend to buy it when it's released, but I have to say that after the first two movies I was blown away by how poorly they followed the book.My family, who had not read any of the books had no understanding at the end when the stag appeared as Harry's Patronus and I spend most of the end of the movie trying to explain it. Not many of the fights between Ron and Hermione were in the movie and that is important to future story lines. Also, there was no introduction of Cedric Diggory who is one of the more important characters in the fourth book.Probably the most redeeming quality is the graphics. The Bus and the CGA Buckbeak were worth the price of addmission, but I still wonder how they're going to handle the 4th movie when there is even more to it."
3,What the........,O.K Now It was an Incredible movie but story was missing way too much. It was dissapointing in theaters because I kept asking myself when is this part going to happen and it never happens.On the other hand very good acting. This movie will not dissapoint people who haven't read the book nearly as much as those who have read the book. Hopefully they will improve on following the books more clearly in future movies.
1,Sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was so bad when my dad wanted to see is again, i had to say no. I dont know where to get started, it was boring, fake, and really made up. Worst camera and cinemetography ever. Horrible acting and directing. I dont know, but i say this movie sucked!!!JK RETARD probably feels like crap from firing the guy from the second movie which was actually pretty good."
1,WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!!!!!!!,"Everything that could have gone wrong in this movie.... did. The awful director left out almost all quiditch, completely rearranged the plot, and made the movie really dark and ugly. Forget whatever any other review says, if you liked the plrevious two movies, YOU WILL HATE THIS ONE. DO NOT BUY IT. IT IS TRASH. I saw the movie in theater, and practicaly cried. There was also a new long, long trail to Hagrid's Hut, that I dont seem to remember being there before. No real Harry Potter fans would enjoy this movie. If you REALLY want to see this movie,rent it before you buy it, it IS possible you know."
1,Most disappointing film I have ever seen!,"This was the most disappointing movie I have ever seen considering the wait for it. I think the makeup department on this one relied on soot and mud. The plot , what little was actually in the movie was an afterthought. Very disjointed and boring. I couldn't wait to leave the theater. My sons thought it was awful. I hope the next director goes back to the old format and makes it a magical experience that all J.K. Rowling books present. Some say the themes was darker, I say all it was was dingy in this movie. The casting of Michael Gambeon was terrible, he reminded me of someones Daft uncle and not the character of Albus Dumbledore. No strength or genuine warmth at all, in fact the most likable character, and the cleanest was, Snape and he's supposed to be the heavy! Unless the next one is better this franchise is on its way out. Save your money on this one and send the message not to mess with the Harry Potter stories."
3,Bad Director=Bad movie,"Alfonso cauron is making this a horrid harry potter movie. the book seems so happy and the previews look so dreary. if that is the third book movie what is the 5th going to be like??? in PoA Ron and Hermione do not like each other. quite the contrary. they are in a fight half the book. the new ""wardrobe"" is not to the book. first of all they don't wear regular clothes that often, and second the robes look fit for an old lady. Chris Columbus, Please come back!!!!!!!!!! Hopefully the movie is better than it looks."
2,SUCKED!!!,"this has to be THE worst harry potter movie so far. i mean the guy didn't even get the whole book. there was a lot more to the book than the movie. i mean the special effects was great, but i mean there's more stuff after he gets his new broom. they didn't even show the stag that comes from his protection curse thing. it was really disappointing. if you haven't read the book then you should probably see it, but if you have read it get ready for a HUGE disappointment"
4,Hogwarts: Year Three!!!,"HP3 was the last of my favorites. After this, the Harry Potter series kinda went downhill for. This one is darker and different than the previous two movies. An escaped convict named Sirius Black breaks out of Azkaban and tries to find Harry. Black is believed to be a supporter of Voldemort. During his 3rd year at Hogwarts, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Lupin teaches him the Patronus charm to defend him against the Demeontors; the guards of Azkaban searching for Black. With the help of Ron, Hermione, and time-travel; Harry will come face-to-face with the man who betrayed his parents. I would recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN!!!"
4,HarryPotterFever,The VHS movie Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban was received as promised in excellent condition. I am enjoying it every chance I get. Thank you!
1,"wow, just no",This is possibly the worst movie i have ever seen in my life and i have seen a lot of movies. The order is totally out of whack and the child actors have no idea what they are doing the only reason you could possibly have of seeing this movie is Alan Rickman.
1,It sucked,"It did. The plot was completly wrong, and they left out most of the important stuff. If I could rate it lower than 1 star I would."
1,Disappointed Fan,"Don't bother producing Ultimate Edition 5 and 6 if you don't produce them with extended versions of the films. That is why I we are buying them. If you had any morals and/or common sense you would produce an extended version of 3 and 4 in which fans who bought the Ultimate Edition could trade them in. This is no way to treat loyal fans that are paying good money for a less than an ""Ultimate"" product."
1,A Pitiful Third Installment in the Film Series,"This movie was a real disappointment. I thought at first that the new director was totally to blame for this Swiss cheese version of the book. However, I must extend the blame to the screenplay writer Steven Kloves and J.K. Rowling. Mr. Kloves' scriptwriting shortcomings were visible in Chamber of Secrets but became really evident this time around. Ms. Rowling deserves a cold look of disdain because she signed off on the whole project. I will have to seriously consider whether I want to add this DVD to my collection. This movie has made me very suspicious of the next two installments - same screenplay writer for both. I shiver to think what he'll do with even longer books."
1,The Directer is Not Up to Speed,"This movie was a let down. The new directer was terrible. It did not follow the book and it completely changed the way characters and places looked. The new Dumbledore was good except his beard and hair was not long enough or white enough, something they could have changed. The acting is poor also. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is awful and so is Emma Watson (Hermoine), though Rupert did a fair job. While its hardly ok to have the other two and not this one it does not compare."
5,Too scary??? Depends on the child.,"A great movie!!! My daughter is a huge fan of Harry Potter movies. She is only 6 and has enjoyed them all. I wouldn't have let her watch them if I thought she was getting scared, but she did great and wasn't scared one bit. I do wish they would have explained who ""Mooney, Wormtail, Padfood and Prongs"" were, then movie goers would have understood why Harry's patronus appeared as a stag (""Prongs"" was Harry's dad, of course, the silver stag). I thought that was a really important piece of the story that was left out."
2,Does not do justice to the Harry Potter book,"I was utterly disappointed by the movie. It was just missing so many things from the book that if you had not read the book you would never know what exactly is going on . I had a huge disappointment from how the patronus charm was depicted in the movie . Instead of a stag "" a jet of light "" . How stupid that can be! The lake was supposed to look like a lake ... it was more like a pool in someone's backyard. All the fun was taken out of the movie. I wish Chris directs the rest of the movies too because the first and the second movies were excellent."
4,Excellent-- Better than the 2nd Movie,"I enjoyed Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban by director Alfonso Cuaron. Perhaps as much as if not more than the inaugural film: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.I did not like the film version of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (tho I did enjoy the book). Hence, I felt it was wise have Cuaron to direct this installment.Cuaron is a talented Direcor and he was able to keep keeps the series and this installment fresh, new and ever-changing like life itself. Futhermore, having the experience of directing ""coming of age"" movies shows in the characters.In this installment the characters have matured. They are now teenagers, willing to take risks. They know especially Harry, that Life is sometimes dark and accept that even if it means overcoming their fears and facing dementors.The Books are EXCELLENT but the movies are also good!!! Don't spoil the books.. read them first then see the movies!!!~FallenMoon"
3,"Good Enough, Could Have Been Better","I feel the movie was done alright and I was able to follow it fairly well because I had read the book. My nine year old son on the other hand was confused until I explained things to him better. As for my younger children, seven and four, they weren't interested at all. It was above their heads and I feel bad that I wasted the money to see the movie in the theater. I know I will buy it for our collection but it is a rare occation the we actually go to the theater. After reading some of the previous reviews I now understand why it wasn't as good as the previous two. I don't feel the director did the book justice and I wasn't impressed with the changing of the scenery and Hagrid's house. The first two movies did it much better justice. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you will enjoy it more than myself."
3,Not as good and I thought,"Very entertaining, but it was not as good or exciting as the first two. Unfortunately this is what you get sometimes with sequels."
2,Dissapointed,"Lucky for me I didn't buy this, but saw it in theaters, and I thought it was horrible. I thought this would be THE BEST movie ever, because I liked the book, but trust me, it's NOT. Somehow, whoever wrote this managed to totally rearange the book so it didn't make sense, then made a movie. As such, I sadly give this a mere 2 stars."
4,The packaging does not fit the film,"This is the deepest, darkest, and probably the best Harry Potter movie so far. The problem I have with the film is not so much as what you would see on the screen, but what you see in the packaging. Warner Bros. has decided that they haven't made enough money on this franchise yet, and has scaled back their packaging from the nice paper cases to the standard cheap plastic.Anyone who has a movie collection has got to be at least a little frustrated with the studio. Think what your DVD collection would look like with the first two LOTR extended edition DVD sets sitting next to ROTK in a cheap little plastic case. And why? So the studio could save a few cents on each one!?(...)"
5,Potter in his best yet.,"After two good, but somehow dissapointing movies, the new director, Alfonso Cuarón, brings Potter out in his finest hour. This, in my opinion is the best movie (and the best book) in the seires yet, and that is truly saying something. They had masterful special effects, such as the dementors and the werewolf, that Chris Colombus could never seem to achive. The casting was beautiful, and I cannot wait for the return of Sirius Black. Being a huge potter fan, I did notice that some parts were left out, but some were left out in the other movies too.The scenes in this movie are absolutly spectacular, especially Hogsmede and the big clock thing. I love everything, and I think that they should keep Alfonso Cuarón and leave Chris Colombus FOR GOOD! :)"
2,very good movie...different director maybe???,"All Harry Potter movies are great, but this one had alot of descrepancies. A couple of them are....When Harry meets the dementors on the train, he says he hears a woman scream. But it's never mentioned again during the film.One more is the fact that they never explain why the dementors are after Harry in the first place. They are supposed to be searching for Sirius Black.However, I've never read the novels, just seen the movies. Maybe in the novel they explain all these things. Even the humor in the movie was dull. Evidently the director was different or he just has made one too many of these to make this latest one good."
2,"Avid book fan, disappointed movie fan","This movie varied from the book, and, had I not read the book, I would've been completely lost as to what was happening in the end. The actors were good, and as a story, it was good, but the differences in the plot are too much for me bear. The special affects for the werewolf simply made me roll me eyes - it looked like a cross between a rat and a man, not a wolf and a man!It is my opinion that the film makers left out crucial information that will be important to people seeing the next movies. It is a fun watch, but it's way too long (three hours) for not enough explanations."
3,"Not the best of the 3, but passable","I've developed quite a fondness for these movies, even before my kids decided they were cool. But Azkaban was missing the charm and magic (no pun intended) of the first two under the direction of Chris Columbus. This new guy injected a dark and dreary atmosphere that undid the whimsical quality that Columbus accomplished. It isn't just a different director's vision - it's a bad one. This could have been any movie about some magic-oriented kids (did they really have to lose the school uniforms and just hang around in jeans?). There was nothing Harry Potter about it other than the names. It just missed the mark.Still, it's not a total loss. If you like the first two just be prepared for a different experience. As a movie fan I generally find good qualities in all movies and this is no exception. Gone is the ""discovery"" phase of Potter and Friends. What's here now is the gang settling into their roles and ""universe"" to get down to business."
2,Very Disappointing,"I think many people have talked about this but the whole reason for buying this DVD was to see a new ""directors"" cut of the movie. The first two ultimate editions of the Harry Potter movie had a least some added footage but this DVD has nothing. I didn't need another copy of the movie."
3,Harry Potter and the Pensioner of Zzzzzican,"I rate it higher than I should but that is based upon the computer graphics which are stellar. Typical Potter fare with no surprises in plot development nor characters' behaviors. The 'novelty' of twisting time to turn back on events has been done previously and better. Sorry, but if your are a devoted Potter fan then you will absolutely rave over this. Every body else will just try to stay awake."
2,Item not as described.,The Dvd I bought was described to be in very good condition but it's not even playable.
3,Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban,"Harry potter (DanielRadcliffe)started his third year at Hogwart school.Harry potter did not know that a murderer,sirius black (Gary Oldeman) escapes the Azkaban prison and want Harry to die.Harry potter is in danger when a great murderer the name of Sirius Black escape Azkaban prison and he is on a look out for Harry Potter .Harry Potter and his two friends as they want to stay one step ahead of the badguy and try to find out why the man wants Harry Potter to die.The length of the movie is 140 minutes long."
3,Not as good as the first two...,"If you are expecting the new Harry Potter movie to be like the first two...you are WRONG. I wouldn't quite call it bad, but I think if Chris Columbus would've directed this one as well, then it would have been MUCH better. I did not enjoy the ""darkness"" of the film. There were very few light or comical moments in this one, aside from when Hermione punches Draco Malfoy. Go Hermione!! Also, I absolutely did NOT care for the new Dumbledore. They didn't even try to make him resemble the original Professor Dumbledore. Even the demeanor of the character is different. Overall...I'd say mediocre, but the special effects are still good."
3,Poon,"There, I hope I grabbed your attention. Here we go. 3 stars, because this movie has no replay value. Once you see this practically 3 hour BEAST, you basically never want to see it again. How many times can these kids keep going back to this school, playing some ridiculous field game, and then ""running into trouble"", without the audience getting bored? Apparently the answer is 3, I'm over it."
4,Don't Read the Book Right Before Seeing the Movie!,"I loved the movie but I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not read the book again before going. The director is certainly a more ""artsy"" director than the previous director (Chris Columbus) and his liberal thinking is evident in the making of this film. The scenery is beautiful and the art director did a wonderful job of creating the majestic Hogwarts that is described in the books. Because it differs from the other movies, many reviewers seem to forget the Hogwarts from the books. There are many cases of dramatic license in the film but I think it gives more visual interest to the story. PoA is my favorite book and this is my favorite movie so far, but when viewing this movie, treat them as two very different works of art."
4,Harry Potter and the Prisnor of Azkaban,I found this movie to be good but not as good as the others. The characters are growing up and are starting to be out of place.
4,Not as good as the book but entertaining just the same,I enjoyed this installment of HP first in the theater and have relived it on DVD several times since. The plot thickens as new charectars from Harrys past emerge despite his friends attempts to stop them. The visuals were good and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first 2. I would highly recommend reading the book after to see what you missed!
1,The director stinks,He should be fired immediatly. How could he make them wear STREET CLOTHES!!!!!!INSANE!!!!!i hope he gets fired!! I HATEEEEEE HIIIMMMMM!!!!!this movie will stink and it hurts.. how could jk rowling let them DO THIS!!!!
1,All of these reviews are biases opinions,"i hate harry potter to the core. I think that it was the dumbest thing that was created in the history of mankind. The books have no depth, or complex ideas. The movie was plain boring. The first few scenes were filled with 'action'(lousy excuses for it), about 'sirius' going to kill harry, but then halfway through the movie, all there was was a day in the life of a scar faced idiot. The actors are highly inprofessional. How could they even earn 3million for doing the movie. This movie stinks. I hate harry potter, and jk rowling for writing such a stupid book"
5,Monsieur Harry Potter,"I still like the first Harry Potter better than the second and the third. In this 3rd DVD, it's good that the story has some twists and turns. I kept asking myself, ""How in the world did Hermione appear in the classroom when she wasn't there a second ago?"" But in the end of the story everything is cleared up (as most of the stories are cleared up). Funny how there's a magical continuity from 1, 2, & 3 when at the end of each story, the mystery/problem is always solved. There's no, ""That's the end?"" kind of reaction."
2,DVD missing scenes!!!,"I am most distressed to find that the ""Widescreen Special Edition"" DVD I purchased is missing numerous small scenes-scenes that are integral to understanding the story!!I have also noticed missing scenes in the Sorceror's Stone and the Chamber of Secrets, which are ""Special Editions"" as well.I, for one, will purchase no more Harry Potter DVD's until this practice stops. I am quite disgusted with the Harry Potter marketers and producers--I feel that I have been cheated out of my money.When JK Rowling et al. begin selling unabridged products, I will consider purchasing her movies again.The movies themselves are good; the DVD's are an outright rip-off.BUYER BEWARE!!!Disappointed fan"
1,Disenchanted,"Yes, I am among all those diehard Harry Potter fans who were very disenchanted by the Prisoner of Azkaban. This director most definately knows nothing about J.K.Rowling's books. It is too bad that Christopher Columbus could not do all of the movies! I know it must be hard to compress the whole book with so much vivid detail into a 2 1/2- 3 hour movie, but there was soo much missing that was important and too much nonsense (chasing his monster book under his bed, eating candy...) and he even changed the landscape of Hogwart's going to Hagrid's cabin. Maybe the suggestion here is to all future directors: READ THE BOOKS, understand the characters, take notes from Christopher Columbus-keep the magic!!Of course, I am still going to buy the DVD, I am curious about the extras."
3,Not shore that the film will live up to the book,Well with every thing that has been in the papers latly i wounder weather the film will live up to the book witch in my opion is the best book so far. I realy hope the film dose well but i think the changes are to much for the fans.Lets hope that the four will live up to the fight to get it in to one film with a break in the middle.
2,"prisoner too plotty, no heart","dudes, it's like, the first harry potter's rocked because they had character elvolving going on; harry was coming into his own, hermione was like trying to fit in; the red haird kid was trying not to fail classes... so, this installment is like, whoa, they are static characters -- no more changes. that's why its flat, only plotty action twist and sh**. i'm not lookin g forward to the next installments, cause where can they go? harry will have to knock up hermione, then the red haird kid'll get jealous and beat the **ck out of harry, and then hermione will make up and they'll have a three-way... i don't know. dig? i'm out. Indy awake at 5:30am. j."
3,The prisoner of What NOW?,"Okay, apart from the title, which I had to spend 10 minutes on pronouncing correctly, it's not a bad film. There are bits of it which reminded me of the Back to the Future trilogy, though. I think J.K.Rowling is getting a little desperate with her storylines, but it just kept up with my expectations of the film; so for that, it passes the ""eh!"" seal of approval. I swear if Alan Rickman (Prince of Thieves, Die Hard) wasn't in this movie, I wouldn't have bothered watching it. BTW, is it me or is there some sexual chemistry between Harry and that english chick?"
3,A bit disappointing,"I really looked forward to this movie, but the changes in it really bothered me. I didn't like the change in scenery, it was way too different from the first two movies, and makes you wonder why they moved Hogwarts? I also didn't like the new Dumbledore.. the actor just doesn't portray the wisdom of the character. The time turning sequence at the end was boring. I really think the first two movies were directed much better. Granted, this one has good effects, but the plot and changes really take away from it."
3,Nice Try for Cuarón,"I went in to see the movie with lower expectations than with the first two, mostly in part due to the change of directors. I feel Cuarón did a good job as far as creating a darker atmosphere overall with the movie. He did, however, leave out many crucial parts to the story line, which would leave non-readers of the series confused. I don't want to discourage anyone from seeing this film, it was still done great, but just doesn't live up to the greatness of the book or the standards set by Columbus with the first 2 films."
4,Great Movie!,"The movie was great, however, if you had read the book prior to seeing the movie, it seemed to leave a lot to be desired. The change in directors was completely noticable, making it almost a completely different movie on it's own. But, once you focused on the movie, it was easier to follow along. I own all of the series up to this point and will definately be continuing. See this movie, it was great!"
1,Why do people watch these stupid Harry Potter movies???,"What is the fascination of these stupid Harry Potter movies.??? This is supposed to be exciting entertainment for everyone...I don't think so!!! This is not even real life situations. Wizards...what are these dumb movies from the ice-age or something? That Daniel Radcliffe must not have any other acting talent whatsoever if these are the only kind of movies he can make. This whole Harry Potter thing has worn out its welcome well before it even started. 1 star is being too generous, it should be rated with no stars!!! If your hooked on these movies than you must not have anything better to do...what a waste of time!"
1,"Crap, crap, crap","This is a rather disappointing movie. There are just so many things wrong with it and it's all due to the new director. First of all, Sirius Black, unarguably most people's favorite character, has had his image ruined. He's supposed to be a rather young man, full of vitality... not a 50-year old helpless geezer who looks as if he sits around the back alley feeding on rats and trash! Second, Oliver Wood and Quidditch were removed completely, taking away the Quidditch Cup and a part of that ""happy memory"" needed for the Patronus, not to mention a lot of people were fans of Wood, and this is supposed to be his third year. And not to be rude, but Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson seriously CANNOT act; their performance is just so pitifully poor."
2,Disappointment,"I am so disappointed to see that this is not an extended version of the movie. This is why I wanted to purchase them, I enjoyed the extended versions of 1 & 2, Why on earth would they stop the extended version for 3 & 4?I think WB should refund all those that pre ordered thinking they would get the extended version of the movie and not just a disc with additional scenes."
1,NOT EXTENDED VIEW,THIS IS NOT AN EXTENDED VIEW LIKE THEY DID WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES! WARNER BROS. PUT MORE EFFORT INTO THE OUTSIDE PACKAGE THAN WHAT'S IN IT.HOW MANY VERSIONS OF THIS DO THEY EXPECT US TO BUY?Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]
2,Ultimate Edition?,"I an not rating the movie itself, here. This is my favorite of the HP movies to date, and I'd give it five stars.However, I was quite disappointed in the ""Ultimate Edition"" materials--particularly in what was missing from this (and the year 4 UE version)compared to the UE of Years 1 and 2. Both of those packs included a fourth disc containing an extended edition of the movie, something which is absent from Years 3 and 4.The Special Feature documentaries in these boxes are nice, and they include a cute little picture book and a couple of sepia-tone cards, niether of which add much to the actual value of the pack. The absence of that extended edition version of the movie is a major failure."
3,the Ultimate edition,"I have been a big fan of the Harry potter series from the start and now that it come to a end its like somthings missing,I've been searching for an extended version of the movies that have the deleted scenes, so when I see the Ultimate edition I will check them out and I am disapointed. Yet when I watch the movies on the television it never fails that I catch a scene that is not in my version. Not to long ago I heared that there was to be a exteneded version and this is what I want, hopefully one day it will become available sooner then later."
4,excellent product,"This is a great movie and one of my favorites out of the series. This is a great family movie, as well."
2,bad,at frist it was great then druring some of the best secnce it got really chopy and stop working and it was the first time opening it for us it was a used copy but we ordered great quality edition but it is a good movie in general but the disc was scratched up and ruined we tryed to fix it but it didnt work
1,How are these Ultimate if NO EXTENDED versions!?!,"Like many of you who purchased the first two ultimate editions at a pretty penny, i was expecting extended editions of movies 3 and 4. What a disappointment! Were the big wigs at WB thinking that their fans would triple dip editions when they bring out all films in one super ultimate collection? I already owned all of the HP on Blu, but sold them when i started buying the Ultimate editions. I will NOT be purchasing 3 and 4. Very poor on WB's part to say its ultimate, and include 8 hours of bonus materials, but not the few extra scenes that regularly show on TV. Very poor indeed."
1,What? No extended?,"What is going on where is the extended? That is what makes it so good! How ultimate is it when you get a pritty box that has the same stuff you already bought? Where is the extended edition? Sure we get a couple pictures, cards and books to add to the collection. Although I want the extended edition so I can watch it crystal clear, without all the commercials. Do I have to wait for the next upgrade to see it uncut? Way to milk the masses of there hard earned paycheck."
2,No Extended Version??----No Sale,"The Extras are nice....sure. But the reason I bought the first two Ultimate Editions was primarily to own extended editions of the films. Warner Brothers is stating that they asked the directors if they wanted to make directors cuts and they both said no. I find that just idiotic. With all that extra footage....and I hear there is a lot....forget the directors. Have a disc of the original and then just make and extended edition without the directors' inputs. People love extended editions and would pay to see them on this package. Just look at the negativity surrounding the Lord of the Rings release. Many, many people would not buy it because it was not the extended editions. Same thing will apply here. I guarantee this will not sell nearly as well as the first two editions primarily because of the lack of an extended version. When will these companys learn? NO SALE!!!!!"
1,Waited for Extended Version for Nothing!!!!,"First time I saw the first two movies were the extended ultimate editions. Waited for next 2 and was extremely disappointed that they will not be extended. Well I ordered the other 4 movies on regular blu-ray instead of waiting forever to see if next #5 & 6 will be extended. They screwed up like the evil idiots who won't release Lord of the Rings extended on blu-ray until they rape the consumers with theatrical versions. Movie itself wasn't to bad, but I've never read or have the time or inclination to read the books, so extended is nice for background info."
4,Best HP Movie,"Well, this movie had mixed reception, obviously, but personally I felt it blew the first two out of the water. It captured the feeling of the story in a way that the others failed miserably. Columbus' films were cheesy, childish, and just not interesting, they lost the depth of the books. This film captured it.There were flaws, the opening scene with Harry using Lumos made me want to break things, but overall excellant, funny, a great adaptation of the books."
2,FAR FROM HOGWARTS... NEAR TO HOLLYWOOD..,When I watched the movie I had to turn it off half way because I didn't want to ruin my mental image of the book. Only Harry Potter freaks understand that. I thought their interpretation of the book was TOO far from Hogwarts and TOO near to Hollywood.
3,I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE CUARÓN!,"I ask you: why did Cuarón have to mess with a great book? A temperamental and brittle movie at best. A good movie, good enough for me to buy a ticket to it, good enough to buy a copy of it, but still a little jumbled. Watson and Radcliffe pull it out of the hat, while Grint moves into the sublime distance. Warner Bros. is starting to show some stretching from knocking the shuttlecock over the net too quickly when they're the only player."
5,One of the best films of the year.,"This is definately one of the best movies of 2004 if not the best. It is filled with dark moody settings, magic, and that Harry Potter glow that fills the films. It immerses you into another world, and in this film you most definately get better glimpses into the characters. The acting, story, and effects are all wonderful. See this film."
3,Dont go if you havent read the book,"While watching the movie, I felt terrible for the person with me who hadn't read the book. The first portion of the movie is missing a good number of transitions and ends up feeling choppy. My only real disapointment was that the cute owl pigwidgeon did not arrive at the end with harry's permission slip signed. Especially since the permission slip had been important during the show.So basicly if you have read the book you might like it (good acting, but the book is reduced to cliff notes).But if you havent read it, you may want to skip it."
4,"Once again, a wonderful book is compressed into a movie.","Okay, first off I have to say that I am indeed a Harry Potter fan and I absolutely adore J.K. Rowling, but when I heard that all the books would be produced into movies, my mind's first thoughts were, ""Dang, another wonderful book compressed into an overrated movie."" However, I went along my merry way and saw the movies, and the first two were surprisingly entertaining. The problem was, though, in the third movie, the plot progressed before I could grasp it. Although I have read the books, anyone who hasn't might not understand the events of the movie. But hey, if you want to see the movie and go against my review, go right ahead."
5,Very Well Done..,"(...)! Frankly, he still did a damn good job...and he wasn't trying to replace the other one. They did what they could...and I respect them for it. I've read the books, I've seen the movies...and sure they may be altered, but the movies are still wonderful as ever. I recommend seeing this movie...why? Because I said so...that's why. It really is a spectacular movie....and by far, my favorite. I can't wait until GOF (...)! Later!"
4,Best Harry Potter So Far,"This is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far. I have made a point to see each movie that has come out. And I think the Prisoner of Azkaban was better - and more scary - that the first two.I also liked the addition of Gary Oldman and David Thewlis to the cast. And I think Michael Gambon does a wonderful job taking his role over from Richard Harris. The only cast member who bothered me was Emma Thompson - she didn't seem to fit it. The minute her character came on the screen I thought ""Oh, theres Emma Thompson"" - I came out of the fantasy and into reality.And I think Director Alfonso Cuarón did a wonderful job with his direction.My favorite special effects were The Dementors, who are pretty frightening just in themselves. They are pretty ugly scary creatures, enough to give small children nightmares.But all in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite Harry Potter movie so far."
3,A disappointment,"This is a good movie but not what I thought it was going to be. The book was the worst book there was(not to say it was a bad book, but just that it wasn't the best by far) but the movie hardly even scratched the surface of the entire story.I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that Dumbledoor changed. I know the first Dumbledoor died and the director couldn't do anything about that but there were a lot of better options for the roll of Dumbledoor than the one they picked.The other thing was that they changed the entire castle. The first castle was much more magical and more exciting. This second castle looked like any castle you might see a picture of in a magazine. It just didn't capture the imagination like the first did.This is a good movie, it just seemed like there were a lot of changes really suddenly that distracted from the story."
4,"Creepy, quirky and utterly gorgeous","Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are back as Harry, Ron and Hermoine, with Hermoine in particular getting to do a lot more. There are less Quidditch matches, and more menace, in keeping with the improved complexity of Rowling's third novel. Hogwarts is not safe, Draco Malfoy is no longer a menace, but just a pain in the ass. And the new CGI-scripted character Buckbeak the Hippogriff (half eagle, half horse) looks fantastic and has personality.The kids are all supposed to be thirteen but look older - hey we'll forgive them. Neville Longbottom has lost so much weight he's almost unrecognisable.All in all, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is an good movie, as long as you don't compare it to the book or other HP movie."
3,Harry Potter???,"The third installment in the Harry movies is by far the worst movie of them all. Alfonso Cuaron needs to be sacked. Where did it all go? The Squid? Cho-Chang? I mean you have to make these movies as parallel to the books as possible and at that Alfonso Sucks! He's lucky I even gave him 3 stars for trying. If you are a fan of Harry Potter do not get this movie because you won't be a fan anymore and if you never liked Harry you'll hate Harry even more. If you are trying Harry Potter for the first time you will ask, ""whats the big fuss about Harry?"" Read the books instead I have nothing against them besides they are way better. Trust me."
5,This movie rocks!! All you purists need to pipe down!,"First off this new director is awesome, the acting is incredible, it was like imagination sprung to life! Sure he cut things out, but books like Harry Potter are cinematically impossible to include every flippin' detail. The point is you get the story and you know what the characters are doing and why. Also this DVD will have deleted scenes and behind the scenes too! AND MOST IMPORTANTLY!!! JK ROWLING HERSELF APPROVES EVERYTHING ON THE FILMS AND LOVES THEM!!! IF THE AUTHOR SAYS THEY ARE GOOD THEN NO ONE ELSE SHOULD EVEN CRITICIZE!!!! I myself have been a fan for ages and this film just rocked! OK just had to make that apparent, watch this movie again or for the first time and watch all the DVD extras with open eyes!! Haryy Potter rocks and so does this movie!!"
2,the worst harry potter there is....,"when this movie came out, i thought it would be the best harry potter move there is because the 3rd harry potter book is my favorite harry potter book. Some parts of the book are left out in the movie such as the winning of the qudditich cup and what are the names meant on the maruader's map. even the landscape has changed in the movie. i also do not like the new albus dumbledore because he doesn't seems like a ""true"" dumbledore. i was very disappointed but luckily i rented the movie before buying it. this movie will not enjoy true harry potter fans."
2,Different Atmosphere,"I did not enjoy this movie compared to the previous Harry Potters. The only thing I liked about it was that the Chracters are older now and I can relate to them. However, I did not like the fact that they were trying to make the movie humerous. It just gave me a different feeling than the previous Harry Potters. They were trying to hard to make the movie funny. Previous Harry Potters had more action and mystery. I did not enjoy the plot. In Previous Harry Potters, Lord Vauldemont was always the center of the problem. He was mentioned in the movie a couple of times, but I just did not enjoy the movie as much."
5,Different but still good.,"I enjoyed the movie after I got over the initial shock of it being so much different from the first two movies. The first time I watched it was dissapointed because I expected it to be like the first two movies. The second time I watched it I enjoyed it more. The major events in the movie follow what happens in the book but some minor things are changed. The whole fight between Ron and Hermione is gone....Harry gets his Firebolt at the end of the movie not at Christmas....the scene at the Whomping Willow is slightly different.....little stuff like that is changed or missing. The actors that played Peter, Sirius and Remus are not like the people I have envisioned in my mind but they do a great job as far as acting. Daniel, Emma and Rupert do an excellent job and their acting continues to improve with each movie.Once the die hard Harry Potter fan gets over the intial shock then I am sure they will find it to be an enjoyable movie. I know I certainly did."
1,CRAP!,"""Ultimate Editions"" Year 3 and 4. How disappointing.No extended editions.No magnetic clasp.Low quality boxes- flimsy with bits ripped and stubbed.Clearly made much cheaper than the first two. What crap! The first two ultimate editions were awesome."
3,LISTEN TO THE FANS,Need I repeat what millions of other fans say. STICK TO THE BOOKS. Azkaban has too much cut out of it.
1,Disappointment.,"After reading the 3rd book, I was highly anticipating the release of the movie. I'm sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed. Alot of people I know loved this movie, but none of them had read the book. The book was AMAZING! It made the movie look dim. There were alot of main points that occured in the story that were not brought out in this movie. The fact that authors have no say in the way the movie of the book they wrote turns out, is ridiculous."
2,Disappointing,"I just couldn't get myself to be enthusiastic about this movie.The atmosphere was so much less magical than in the first two films, mainly because the main characters wear the same ""civilian"" clothes and look dishevelled most of the time, but also because they had to hire a new actor as Professor Dumbledore. Hogwarts will never be the same without Richard Harris :(It also seems the director took the ""dark film"" idea literally: there are too many gloomy sets and cloudy skies in this movie.And the special effects - well, I admit I'm spoiled by LoTR, but the creatures just didn't move right (with the exception of the Dementors).I hope so much they'll hire Chris Columbus again to do the next film!"
2,not impressed,Let me just say this movie almost made me want to cry it was so bad this movie is definitly different then the other two films the first two i enjoyed because they didnt just focus on the plot the plot in the other two was slowly revealed throughout the year whyll still focusing on other things this film does not do that.I remember back before the first movie came out how many people thought it would be really bad and not follow the story and not be like how they pictured the characters well if number 3 had came out first there wouldnt be anymore everything is different in it hogwarts is in a different location hagrids house is now on top of a hill there is no lake there is no forbidden forest. Anything that has nothing to do with the main plot is not in the film.
3,Pretty good...but,"Well the movie had both good and bad points, the visuals were stunning, the trio of main characters were more mature (as they should be by this time.) The story was treated in a darker manner again, as it should be. The books progress in that direction.The bad part to me was what some are claiming was so good. There are, in my opinion, too many departures from the story in the book. I understand the need to modify certain parts that would be difficult or clumsy to portray on film, but the director seems to want to show us his, not the authors vision of the book"
5,JUST THE BEST HARRY POTTER MOVIE!!,"I just saw Harry Potter and the Prisioner of Azkaban and I can tell you it is the best movie of Harry Potter up to now, hope Alfonso Cuarón will do the next movies, I can wait to see the next one. Is a most see movie (at theaters and a most have for every Harry Potter fan!!!!"
5,HARRY POTTERS#1FAN OF ALL,"I RATE THIS MOVIE FIVE STARS,IF THERE COULD BE TWEENTY I WOULD SAY TWEENTY.I REALLY LIKE DRACO'S HAIR STYLE ALOT.I THINK DRACO IS SO CUTE.I REALLY DONT CARE IF HE IS RUDE OR NOT.WHY DONT HARRY&DRACO GET ALONG?REPLY IF YOU LIKE TO."
1,Can't Believe it....,"I used 2 love the Harry Potter books, they were wonderfully made and the characters had their own personalities. But this movie has bad acting, bad special effects, bad directing, bad cinematography, bad sound, bad music, bad sets, etc etc etc............. why do they keep switching directors???? stick with one!!! Peter Jackson should give Alfonso Cuarón some serious lessons in movie-making. Peter Jackson took a beloved epic series, and turned them into a wonderfully-made epic motion picture trilogy. Alfonso Cuarón took a good book and turned it into a horrible disaster of a movie. Not worth seeing or even renting at the library!!!"
2,Very disappointed.,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan. watched all three movies in the theatre at least twice, got all the DVDs, etc.I think Chris Columbus did a good job with the first two, but Cuaron messed up the third one big time. I don't think he has even read the book thoroughly enough to truly understand it. PoA, my favourite book so far from the series after the 5th, was expected to be the best HP film yet by many Harry Potter fans, but it is the truth that many were disappointed. I used to think JK Rowling was kind of harsh with the whole sticking-to-the-book thing with the Chris Columbus, but now I can see that she said that for a good reason, because PoA turned out to be a wee bit better than just 'crap'."
3,Pretty good entertainment...,"Ok...I'm one of those terrible people who does not read the Harry Potter series of books but instead watches the movies. I'm sorry!This, the third installment of the Harry Potter movies, WAS ok, but not as good to me as the first two. This must have been a very complex book, because they just tried to do too much in the plot of this one.I did enjoy it because Harry ends up learning much more about his parents through the addition of some other characters, including a surprise one or two. I especially liked his ""connection"" with the Prisoner of Azkaban, which ends up being sort of a plot twist.It'll be interesting to see where they go from here with the movies, because overall I enjoyed myself. It DID just seem a bit crammed."
2,"Like the book, this is where the series begins to slip","Cute but getting played, flat, mediocre plot, wait for cable if possible. But if you can never have too many movies in your library the extras are worth it."
5,keep 'em!,"they had better not get any other people to play the parts of harry, ron, and hermione! every sequel that's made with different characters than the first movie has been a major flop!!! i'm way psyched for #3 and i sure hope they go on with the same peops for all the other books!!!i love you Ron!!!!"
3,harry potter,there was a few things i liked about this movie and others i didnt like ... im a big fan of the books .... at first i didnt like the costume change coz it looks stupid but i kindda like the uniforms now ... but i seen pictures from the new movie and they've changed the uniform back 2 the old way (thats really stupid) the new dumbledore wasnt that bad ... i didnt like the way they put things in it that wasnt even in the book ... i agree with some of the other reviews that it was a silly ending and the backround was diffrent ... what a strange film
1,Harry The Horrible,"The 3rd HP movie was out of this world (in the worst way). There were 3 bad things about it was Just boring, it didnt makemuch sense, and it was nothing like the book.MD,age 10"
2,OK......VERY BAD DIRECTOR!!!!!!!,"ok.......the director for this one.......STINKS!!!!!!!!! There are many things in this movie that make me say WTF! First off, lupin has no grey hair, dumbledore looks feeble because his costume looks like he is wearing a noghtgown, to many missing sceens, and what was with that pedgleum in the great hall! There was nothing about it in the books why add it. Someone could get hit with that thing. The grounds change.....looks good but why would you do that......the grounds are way to differnt! Alfonso Cuaron should NEVER do another Harry Potter movie. He nearly destroyed the story by remaking it in his own image. I going to buy it only so I have all the movies to date.....but it was a sad attemped at a great story."
2,Love HP Disappointed in THIS movie.,"I loved the other 2 movies and all the books. I was left cold by this movie though. I was not the fault of the story or the actors. The direction was fair and whoever edited this movie obviously is not familiar with the books. It felt choppy and bumpy. Several important scenes and relevant information were left out. I can only hope the dvd will be an extended version. If nor, I won't be buying it."
1,What in the world were they thinking?,"I am in a state of shock! Any sane person who actually read the book could oviously see the stupid changes made and the EXTREMELY important things left out. For instance, they COMPLETELY didnt even explain anything about being animagus and didnt explain who MOONY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS were! Its outlandish. ANd what was withthe shrieking shack. they spent what, 45 seconds in it? And since when did Harry get the Firebolt at the end? He got its 6 months earlier at christmas! Sure, I understand changes have to be made to make it into a movie, but these were obsurd. I hope they can this guy and go back to Chris Columbus. AT least he respected the proper order and scenery of the book."
5,Awesome Flick!,"Love all of the Harry Potter movies, just bought the last one a few days ago. I'm also a widescreen girl, so I had to get the widescreen version. This is a great product if you like the movie and don't want to pay extra for the special features."
5,Better than I remembered,"I haven't read any of the books, and I saw this movie years ago when it came out, but recently watched it again with the family. It was better than I remembered. The story, acting, scenery, special effects, etc. are all quite good, so we all enjoyed the movie. I just don't care for the darker mood of the movie as compared to the brighter original, and there's nothing particularly ""deep"" here. There's also a time travel aspect of the story which generates the usual logical contradictions, but it's handled smoothly enough that the contradictions can be ignored. So I'll go with 4 stars rather 5, though I can still recommend it to people interested in a fantasy action movie which has some scary elements."
4,?????,i sent it to a friend.dont have anything to say......ok--------------dont have anything to say..and and and..i did i did id didididididididi
2,Where are the deleted scenes?,"I purchased the two-disc Special Edition version of this film. Amazon states on their website that it contains deleted scenes. Am I missing something here? Because I can't find any deleted scenes. Are they on the ultimate editions? If anyone could help me, I would really appreciate it! Thanks."
4,Not too bad...,"I obviously have a different views than many others that reviewed this DVD. I acknowledge that it did not follow exactly to the plot of the book, but i still found it entertaining. i was not angry that it did not follow the exact plot, because i can still see this as a harry potter movie. however, this did not have a sufficeint(sp?) helping of one of the things i love about the Harry Potter books and movies. It lacked the day to day hogwarts enviroment and flavor that JKR developed so masterfully. that was one of my favorite things about these books and movies. It was still a good movie, and i plan to add it to my collection.P.S.- the reveiwer a few down was correct, Dumbledore's fill in was not as wise looking as the old one. He just didn;t have that ""wizard"" feel to him"
1,Not What the Book Says!,"I didn't like this movie at all, and if I could give it zero stars I would. Here's why:1. Don't buy DvD or Vhs scences will be missing. (lots of them)2. They take out so much stuff from the book. It dosen't even have the same ending. I think they could have made it thrity minutes more with important stuff like ROn getting his owl.3. This guy must not even know who J.K. Rowling is or what Harry Potter is! They don't have any of the stuff the book says would be in the candy shop, but we do get some unneeded things.He has the Actors and Actoresses wear the normal every day stuff.4. They add so many un wanted or needed stuff it's sick.So if you read the book you'll have more info of what should have been in the movie. Saddly all Harry Potter fans will just have to have a movie in their heads and hope for a remake, and if you just want to see a good movie get the first two movies or go see the fourth movie."
4,Confusing movie - Great acting by Radcliffe and Rickman.,"I am a big Harry Potter fan. I've read all the books and I've seen this and the other two films. I knew what was going to happen of course, but my friends who came along with me did not. I've seen the movie with four different people who hadn't read the books, and none of them understood the movie. I had to explain it twice. Personally, I thought it far better than the first two, but it cut way too much out and did not tell enough backstory. As for acting, I thought Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job. He was dead on - his anger in spots gave me the chills. I also thought Alan Rickman was awesome. His voice, his expressions, he IS Snape. The Shrieking Shack scene just proves it. I was also surprised by David Thewlis as Remus Lupin - He was not how I pictured Lupin at all, but he played the part wonderfully. It is a great movie and I suggest seeing it, especially if you have read the books."
5,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Askaban,"This movie is the best yet. Danial and the rest of his crew ( excluding the new Albus) were awsom. J.K. Rowling, your the best there is. The movie is so diffrent from the other two, but so much better. You won't forget it."
3,Was a Great Movie...,"The Third Harry Potter Movie was really great, but I found it a little disappointing. All the actor's were wonderful and the new director did an outstanding job but the faults that I found was that it didn't stick to the book that much and the scenes that did were out of order, also I felt that major important information was left out. If your an avid HP fan and read all the books this can be kinda of a letdown. Though on the upside there was alot more magic and the special effects were awesome."
3,Sad,"I loved the book, so maybe my expectations were too high going into the theater. To see your favorite book made live will obviously disappoint a bit, but i wasn't expecting this. If I had never read the books I would have probably have loved the movie, so this probably isn't the fairest review ever, but oh well. They deviated so much from the book. The main bits were there, but things were moved around, ignored, or just tweaked to make it fit into the time allowed. It was a shame really, becuase like I said I love this book. But as other reviews have said, the best Harry Potter movies will be those in your head, while you read the book. Go see the movie, but definately don't go expecting it to follow the book."
3,"good actors, really bad movie","the actors in this movie are great actors, Emma Watson did a great acting, but the movie itself is bad, doesn't have anything to do with the book.i agree with other reviews that the movie is good IF you haven't read the book, but if have not read the book there is a lot of things that you don't understand, wich is not the idea, most of the people that wants to see this movie have read the book, and the book is far diferent.we miss the other director, the two first movies were a lot better than this one, the new director should respect the details of the other movies like the sorroundings around Howarts, and i don't know were he took the idea of that giant pendulous in the main entrance...........The movie was to short, it needed some extra time for important details......"
3,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed that this movie was not as close to the book as the previous 2 movies. There was a lot of hype prior to the movies release, inlcuding them saying that all your favorite parts in the book would be in the movie. They weren't.There was not the level of interaction between Harry, Ron, and Hermione that there should have been. That is one of the things that made the other 2 movies so good. You didn't have to read the books to understand what was going on in the movies. I know several people who had not read the book before going to see the movie, and they were left pretty lost.The CGI for Lupin as the werewolf and Sirius as the dog were very also disappointing after the terrific CGI in the first 2 films.Changing the location of Hogwarts was also a bad move. I liked the original set/filming location better. Bad continuity."
1,I will wait until WB releases extended versions,"After purchasing the ultimate editions for the first two films, I eagerly anticipated a release of a true ultimate edition for the next two films. I am completely disappointed to find that films 3 and 4 are minus the extended versions without which they are not ""ultimate"".I will wait for the negative fallout to encourage WB to release ultimate editions with the extended versions of the 3rd and 4th films. I would hope that people who already bought these films will be given vouchers to receive the updated ultimate editions free of charge."
2,No extended scenes make package disappointing.,"A very short review. As a loyal fan, I've seen documentaries, read bios, looked at stills, seen the films repeatedly, read the books, read reviews, and so when the Ultimate Editions were announced I thought I would probably get them but what new information could it provide to me? I was plesantly surprised with Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets as they added deleted scenes to the film that allowed for viewing of an extended versions, which in some cases made the film flow better like the book. However, something went amiss in the release of Azkaban as there is no extended version on this Ultimate Edition. Very disappointed. I will still acquire these collections but I will not pay for them. At least I have something for gift lists when I'm asked what I may like to have given to me. Simply, don't waste your own money for stuff you've seen before. The pretty box and booklet are only worth other people wasting their money for you."
5,Finger-nail biter,I'm always amazes at J. K. Rowling's imagination. She is a superior story teller.I was on the edge of my seat from the first page to the last. I'm 72 years old and I can't think of any story that has fascinated me the way the Harry Potter Adventure Series does. I hope I live long enought to be able to read the last or the rest of her books.
4,Prisoner of Azkaban,"It was a great movie, with some new characters. I agree that there were ALOT of things left out of the movie, that the book explained, especially who Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs is.The change in Dumbledore was an unfortunate necessity, with the passing of the original Dumbledore character. Also, I was thrown by the change in Location. Why the new scenery?I think the new director did capture the darker side of this chapter well enough, and a bit of comedy with the scenes on the Knight Bus, but I think there was still room for more information in backgrounds if they hadn't spent as much time watching Harry fly on Buckbeak (an awesome sight and great effects, but still a bit long)."
3,Missing something,"Unlike most of the reviewers I don't think this is the best of the three. In fact I think the other two were way better.Unfortunately I don't think the new Dumbledore has as great of a presence like Richard Harris. Maybe they should have looked towards Ian McKellen, although it is sad that they had to find the replacement in the first place.The movie was ok but I felt like a lot of the core content from the book was left out leaving me feeling a little empty. A good example is they never really explained the relationship between the rat, the teacher and Sirius."
5,The magic continues!,Harry Potter and friends continue their magical journey at Hogwarts while bedeviled by Harry's old enemy - or is he? Adults can indulge their inner child while kids learn valuable lessons about friendship and loyalty. Highly recommend!
2,Fairly Disappointed,"Ok, I am a very avid reader of the harry Potter books. i agree that anyone that has read the book was disappointed in the movie. The first two were great, however in this one, there was so much they left out. At the end, I was expecting there to be at least another half an hour of film because of how much they missed. I am looking forward to the fourth movie but I cant help but think that it is going to be the same outcome. Since they keep changing directors, the set of the school and everywhere else is going to continue to change. I hope not, but it is inevidible."
4,"beware, digital copy NOT INCLUDED","Beware, because this special edition does NOT include a digital copy version, even when it's announced on a sticker & a page with the code comes with the package"
2,"Flat, Drab, Disappointing","Alfonso Cuaron has made a drab and disappointing film. Here is a classic example of a director mucking up a perfectly fine story. While of course it isn't possible to put every nuance of these books onscreen, Chris Columbus did a fine job with the first two. In this one, Cuaron reshuffled the Hogwarts grounds layout for no reason, ignored most of the secondary storylines even when they were extremely important to the story as a whole, failed to develop the new characters, and apparently told the actors to walk through their parts. After the first two wonderful Harry Potter movies, this was a big let-down."
1,NO EXTENDED versions!?!,"I as well am very disappointed that this and the 4th do not have extended editions of the movie. that is the ONLY reason that I bought the 1st and 2nd ultimate editions. I bought the 3rd without reading the cust reviews so my bad there, I doubt it very much that I will be buying the 4th. I don't think I will even be watching the 3rd since it is the same as my 2-disc set. :( very poor planning of Warner Bros. when getting these together."
2,What a rip-off,"What exactly is so ""Ultimate"" about these editions? They don't contain the extended versions of the movie... just a bunch of silly cards and a mildly-amusing booklet with some stills. There's a couple ""bonus discs"" of extra content but all of the content could easily have fit on one extra disc... with room to spare.No director's commentary, no real effort was put into this. Even the ""Marauder's Map"" screen saver is just a twitty little add-on that your kid could do in about 10 minutes... just advertising for the film and a few stills.I was quite stoked about these editions but now that I have them, I'm wondering why I bothered."
3,Better than the first two.,"I know. That isn't saying a whole lot. But at least I didn't coming out of this installment wanting to strangle the young stars. If a director can make these three annoying kids--Radcliffe perhaps the most cloying among them--seem downright enjoyable and, dare I say it, heroic, then he's quite the talent.What I liked most about Prisoner of Askaban was the tone, and the use of some interesting--if dated--transition effects, like the blurry iris closing or opening, to give Prisoner the feel of something ancient and macabre. There truly is an otherworldly effect from the way this movie was put together.Gary Oldman, sadly, is wasted in the almost throwaway role of Sirius Black; hopefully, we'll see more of him in future installments. Thankfully, Harry Potter, as least the film incarnation, is heading in the right direction--away from silly, annoying treacle to something darker and bewitching. Here's hoping they don't double back and add more frosting to the next one."
5,HP3 was up to par with my expectations,"I love harry potter, so naturally HP3 was amazing. Ive seen it twice so far, and i can't wait for the 4th movie :-)"
3,Lost Interest,"As with all 5 of the HP movies, it just seems like way too much is going on: too much special effects, too many characters, too many subplots, too much artificial and temperamental drama-and try as I might-my mind wanders and honestly I just don't care. The characters, conventions, dialogue etc all seems like such stale unsurprising cliches: The horribly neglected and opressed orphan, the overachieving girl who ends up with the slacker goofy but sweet boy in loving bickering, the emotionally matrubatory almost soap opera drama queen dialogue over poorly drawn conflicts I can't keep track of, etc. And none of Brittain's most aclaimed actors can save it.Perhaps the books are different and I'm just not a kid anymore. I wanted to like HP, but I just couldn't make myself. I can't be the only one."
4,Wonderful story! Worth seeing!,"Saw the movie at a regular theater and was a little disappointed. Just saw it again at an IMAX Theater and it was fantastic. So much from the book was left out, but what else can they do? There were young children watching and some scenes did give them a scare. I must admit the Werewolf scene was a bit much for me and it could have been less graphic. There were a lot of changes in the Hogworth's grounds....don't think I like them. Buckbeak, Knight Bus, Lupin, Lupin's class room, Sirius, and the rest were great. Of the two times I saw this movie, there were more adults (lot of them seniors) than children. It's a wonderful story and this movie is worth seeing! Try to find an IMAX Theater it's the best!"
2,Responsible persons should be shipped to Azkaban IMMEDIATELY,"I'd be here for hours if I were to try to explain how I felt about this movie. I felt betrayed and utterly disappointed. This should have been the biggest and best film yet. Having read the book over the summer with my children, we were very excited to see what we thought was going to be one hell of a movie. I was so disappointed and shocked that this was IT, that I nearly cried while the credits rolled. Wish they could use Hermoine's necklace to go back and fix this wrong!!"
1,What did this guy do?,"This movie was dismal. Hogwarts is not magical anymore, its dark and creepy. There is a huge hillside down to Hagrids that i found really annoying. The plot is gone and the busride with the wierd head is stupid. Why on earth did this cuaron take Columbus's wonderful vison of hogwarts found in 1 and 2 and trash it with a clock, bridge and a hillside. I want Columbus back, be true to the books or stay away from these movies!"
2,I MUST AGREE - BRING BACK CHRIS COLUMBUS!,"I am disappointed for all the reasons cited by the reviewers who aren't terribly fond of this version of Book 3; too dark, too short, too little plot elaboration, too little humor. It doesn't do the book justice. I wanted to see more of Neverland and the lost boys. What I got was a poorly constructed episode of ""Buffy."" Bah humbug!"
2,Cuaron was the worst thing that happened to this movie,"Okay the director is what really suffered in this movie and the box office reciepts showed it. It moved too fast with little connection or explaination; characters personalities aren't built well;The worse thing you can do is read the book first and then watch the film; too late you say, oh well it is still enjoyable for those games of ""Spot what they did wrong"" and ""Shots"".I suppose the writers should have gotten a lot of the blame too, but at least they read the book!...at least I would have hoped so. JKR did such a good job at reining the writers in the first 2 movies, she should have kept a closer eye on them this round too.A great book that crashes and burns.Let's all hope book 4 fares much better--although they will be cutting out the Dursleys entirely...that is just wrong on so many levels!"
2,Alfonso Cauron's real name is Adolf Hitler,"Cris Columbus, save us! This Hitler impersonater tells us he want's a two hour movie instead of a three hour one. What do I say about a three hour movie? So What! Lord of the Rings was three hours long, and I've watched all three hundreds of times!"
5,Harry Potter Still At The Top,Spectacular 3rd edition to the Harry Potter Volume Series. Never missed out on the book or the movie rendition. Excitingly awaiting the next book and film. Great acting and adaptation of the book.
2,cookiecorp,"Too much book, not enough movie. Too many holes in movie.The book is too big ( twice as big as book 1 or book 2 ) to make a movie out of. I did like it for what it was,and that really was'nt very much, too much of the book was left out, but I've read the book and the movie leaves me wanting more. Just not enough time to make the movie half as good as the other 2 movies were. An extra Hour would not have hurt but 2 would have been better.I suggest see movie first so you won't be too disappointed.I can't see how book 4 or book 5 can be made into movies that will be worth seeing."
5,HARRY POTTER WINNER,"GREAT MOVIE FOR THE HARRY POTTER FANS. GREAT BUY, ARRIVED QUICK WITHOUT A SCRATCH."
1,Harry Potter is no good.,"I'm not sure exactly which of the series I saw, but it was definitely not for children.This may seem like a great children's STORY, which it is, but the movie has hidden messages of homosexuality.Please do not watch this."
1,One of the worst Movies ever,This is not a movie it is a sad attempt to make a once great novel into a film. I don't even enjoy reading the books now. The entire Harry Potter craze has ended for me. The first 2 movies were just as bad as this one but this third installation ruined it all for me. awful
5,Potter is back for the 3rd movie,"I have to be honest when I say that when I first heard Harry Potter was being made into a movie I thought it would be stupid and just for smaller kids. I was surpise when I saw the movie it was better than I thought. I was hooked, I saw the second movie in the theaters with my family and found it better than the first (even though some my disagree). I have read all the books and can't wait to see how they make the movies. The books seem to be growing, there is more action and the kids get in a lot more danger. I want to see how they handle some parts in the film, Harry Potter seems to get hurt worse in the newer books. But I don't want to say too much because I hate to ruin it for those who didn't read the books. I can just say that I can't wait to see the movie and can't wait for the 6th book."
3,Some problems I hade with this movie...,"I am a Harry Potter extream fan. I have read all the books over 4 times and sceen all the movies many times. I thought that all the HP movies left some stuff out. I also heard that some people thought that the movie was made a little darker then the first two. This is because the books get darker from now on...POA is where is turns. One MAJOR problem I have with the movie is the clothes. I am pretty sure that there is no ""Old Navy"" or ""Gap kids"" in Hogsmead so where did they get there clothes from. I want there uniforms back.I don't want Columbus to come back, but I also don't want Cuaron to come back either. I think that Tim Burton should direct at least one of them. Maybe Goblet of fire."
2,Creativity and Directors,You have to read the book AND see the movie. They are different. Another ego-stricken director with dilusions about his creativity. Similar to Jackson and Two Towers.
5,Best film ever,"I thought it was great, thrilling and exciting! It keeps you on your toes the whole time. However it does not include everything in the book so watch out. I still think that it is one of the best Harry potter film ever as the special affects are great!"
3,Details? What details?,"As a Harry Potter fan and a fan of Prisoner of Azkaban in particular, I looked forward to the release of this film. However, I was disappointed in the lack of story behind the pretty shots and artistic moments.I can understand, due to time constraints that some things needed to be cut. I'd forgive leaving out the Quidditch Cup if there was other things going on. There were not. How is is possible to make a film of Prisoner of Azkaban and not explain about James Potters' friends as animagi? If you didn't read the book, you'd have no idea what was going on in the movie.Also, while the film was dark, I didn't get that the sense of fear regarding Sirius Black was a big enough issue. If that aspect was palyed up, then the film would have been that much more intense.If you want to understand the story of Prisoner of Azkaban, read the book. If you want to be left confused by a film with chunks of story left out of it, by all means...see the film."
3,The movie needed more,"Although I liked the movie it was lacking a lot of important parts. For people who havn't read the books, it was probably real comfusing. The movie didn't really explain how lupin knew harry's father or a lot of the other teachers and a lot of the parts in the story were moved around. I have read the books and thought the movie was kind of disappointing because they left out the really good parts that would have made it more understandable. Although Cuaron had a very good imagination for the movie and made it so realistic, it was kind of hard to understand it. I would still buy this movie though."
5,Excellent movie!,"I think that ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a great movie. I have read all of the books three times, and I think the new director did a great job. I was not disappointed at all. I mean, compared to the books, none of the movies are any good, but the books were amazing and the movie was great. All of the people who didn't like it are crazy. I would definately spend my money on this one. :D"
3,Too much change.,"The director of this movie definately didn't stick with the books, and that's made me as well as loads of other people unhappy. Very important information was taken out (Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs!) and unneeded scenes were added in (the Gryffindor boys eating that candy and making animal noises - how was that important?!). I'm really upset with the director. Chris Columbus did a much better job. Hopefully the newest director won't mess it up for everyone again."
1,Worst Movie Made,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is one of the worst films made. This film is too dark and there was no humor where the film got too tense. The only humor I found interesting was when Harry uses his magic to inlfate his aunt.
3,It Doesn't Live Up to the Book,While the movie was entertaining it did not even come close to living up to my expectations. One of the biggest disappointments for me was that they failed to keep some of the very elements of the book that explained the story line. For instance they didn't explain the significance or the history of the Shrieking Shack. Therefore you didn't really understand why it was there. In addition they didn't explain why Harry's Patronus was the same animal that was connected to his father. Very disappointing.
5,"Beautiful music, great performances.","Normally I don't like most 20th century music. I do, however, like these lovely concertos by Rodrigo; and these are my favorite performances. Romero is my favorite classical guitarist and he plays these pieces superbly -- with skill, romance, and emotional commitment -- ably accompanied by Previn. The highlight of this disc is the gorgeous slow movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez, but all of the music is attractive and played superbly. Highly recommended."
1,The price listed is way to much.,I got this same lap top for under $400. do not buy this laptop for 1399. way to much. I got it for like $250 on black friday and normal price was about $400.
1,Not a French Foreign Legion hat!,"This item is described as a French Foreign legion hat, but the French issue a white kepi (kepi blanc) and this hat as I received it is actually tan in color. This looks like a Nazi hat from WWII. I strongly urge anyone considering purchasing this item to consider taking your business elsewhere. I am not dissing the seller as far as any other items they may be selling, but as far as this item goes, be aware. I wrote the seller and they replied in a very defensive manner."
3,This Company is a Sad Piece of Work,"For those of us who remember the film or have read Beau Geste, a ""kepi blanc"" (even a costume version) could be worth having. Thus, the photo (carrot of one in the company ad. This particular company, evidently, does not deliver exactly what it promises. The tan-colored kepi they sent to me might have a valid place in the French Foreign Legion hierarchy but to own one isn't the reason I made this purchase. And obviously, this company knows that as well. How unscrupulously clever of them. Please deal carefully with these folks!"
3,Okay Bells,"I used these bells with my baby music class, and they sounded great and looked fine for a while. But they didn't stand the test of time, and the fabric began to shred. I had to throw them away and wouldn't get them again. If you don't use them too much or don't mind threads of the fabric coming off, this probably won't be a problem, but they didn't really work for me."
5,Truly Wonderful!,"This is an amazing collection of stories. I have read it over and over, you'll want to also! Stories range from sad to beautiful, encompassing women in all their ranges and types. I won't waste your time by re listing the stories quill has done a great job of that, but my favorites were the Rape Patrol and Northern Chess. If you liked Marion Zimmer Bradley's Sword & Sorceress, you'll enjoy this book too."
4,what is currently known about pulsars,"Pulsars are one of the most fascinating types of astronomical objects known. This new third edition gives a comprehensive and up to date description of what is known about them.Much of the book is the same as earlier editions. Like the now familiar story of how the first pulsar was discovered in the 60s by Jocelyn Bell. And how a Nobel was later awarded to her advisor. (Considered by some to be a massive oversight.)The book explains how pulsars let us probe cosmological distances and times. (The two are related.) It gives the latest models for pulsar formation. More recent results include the solving of the gamma ray bursters conundrum. A deep puzzle until recently, when satellite observations proved vital in explaining bursters."
4,Women in the Military... Nothing New!,"We might think that women in the military is a modern day phenomenon, related somehow to the Women's Lib movement. But, SURPRISE, Richard Hall paints a colorful historical picture of many patriotic and dedicated women who, in a period in our country's history dominated by hoop skirts and constricting corsets, secretely traded their hoops and corsets for military battle uniforms. Disguised as men -- the only way for these women to serve in our country's Civil War military campaigns -- they served in disguise, discovered as women only when they were injured and required medical care in field hospitals! Author Richard Hall has researched these women's lives extensively, and the many pages of actual Civil War-era photographs and engravings included in the book bring these women's stories to life in vivid detail."
3,Patriots in Disguise,"Not wildly scholarly, but reasonably useful discussion of women who were on the battlefield in the Civil War. This is structured around descriptions of specific women such as the nurse Anna Etheridge, the soldier Franklin Thompson, the whatever-she-really-was Loreta Janeta Velazquez. There isn't much theoretical discussion here, nor is there much explanation of how women's disguises were able to work--and, despite the title, much time is given to vivandieres, nurses and the like."
2,Well! Not what I expected.,"The recording is very good (1 star). It's the King's Singers (another star). It ends there. I do not like these arrangements. The over-done extended tertian harmonies offend me when paired with traditional folk songs. I was expecting the English countryside, and I got Las Vegas show-glitz. I'm glad I didn't pay much for this CD because I will not be listening to it."
4,A great romance and a fun mystery...,"The back of the book says:With a resolve as cold as steel and a thirst for vengeance, U.S. marshal-turned-Confidential-agent Conrad Burke tracked his quarry like a Wild West hero of old. Until the trail led to his downfall- the one woman he'd always loved. Marilyn Langworthy, billionaire's daughter- and after one reckless night, mother of Con's unborn child.His quest placed her in jeopardy. But although the mobster he sought took no prisoners, only Marilyn had the key to bring the man down. Now Con would move heaven and earth to keep marilyn safe...The romance was sweet and I really liked the characters. The mystery was a little farfetched but I don't read these books for realism."
2,Not as useful as I had hoped but not bad,"I bought this case with the expectation of clipping it to my belt or bag, making my phone more accessable. It fit where I wanted it but it's very hard to get it off quickly. I have missed several calls because I can't get it unhooked quick enough (but that could just be me.) I'm passing it on to a family member who liked it.The velcro-secured cover also gets caught in my hair and gets in my way when I am in a hurry. It doesn't prevent me from accidentally pushing buttons on the phone, but that may just be my fault. I won't buy another for me but I will probably buy one for my husband, if I don't find one I like better."
1,Is this a bootleg,"First of all, that's not Long John Baldry on the cover, he doesn't paly harmonica, and after touring with him for 20 years, I should know.Baldry never released a CD called ""Midnight in New Orleans""There's no label listed here, and the 2 cds listed here were released by Stony Plain. Hopefully Amazon will check these a little better to make sure they're not bootlegs"
4,Cheap package but good value contents,"Cheap packaging here, no booklet, pressings not top rank, but two full albums (It Still Ain't Easy & Right To Sing The Blues) at a budget price mean you can't complain too much. Albums are a mixed bag of tracks but all up there's still a lot of good blues here for the money. Fans will enjoy."
5,Delightful,"String quartets are like a window to the soul of the composer and Nielsen is wide open in this recording, specially in No. 1 Sensual, but with majestic intentions.Nielsen has some hints of Schubert, but is very personal.The performance by the Oslo string quartet is excellent and obviously have a feeling for scandinavian music.At Naxos prices, a no brainer."
3,Warning,"If this follows the same pattern of the other ""Pickin' On"" offerings, this is just a collection of instrumental songs, and not by the Chicks themselves."
4,SUNDAY GOLF,"The characters are so real and interesting. This story being about men and their growing friendships. Sunday Golf explores their vulnerabilities, insecurities and secrets. When their wives and significant others get involved it really get's your juices going and you cannot help but have strong feelings for what's going on with them. The cliche ""page turner"" is overated but,this really is a good read and it will have you wanting to know what's going to happen next. Russel's wife Connie is a ""B""!GOOD JOB MRS. HARRIS"
2,disappointing babar book,"The repetition of the word succotash seems to be the driving force of this book. I kid you not, the moral is explicitly spelled out at the end of the story: ""Succotash! That is how life is--right mixed with wrong. Like succotash: lima beans cooked up with corn."" While nicely illustrated, the book's dialogue is dull and inane."
2,Misguided attempt,I read this book with great interest. I have known a few people that practiced these kata. This book does not present the real kata but instead a modified version of the first two pinan. The history is good but if you want these Kata get Funakoshi's Karate do Kyohan because the heian/pinan kata are there. I guess this wasn't a bad attempt just misguided. There are still a few that practice these Kata if you look hard enough.
5,Powerslave,"Yet another quality album. This shows the variety they were and are capable of. Their melodies are second to none. This one I feel is more on the speedy side. Very unique style of Metal, seems to appeal to a wide audience. I think most Maiden albums with Bruce are classics."
3,WAY OVERATED!,"Whats up with all you people giving this a perfect score?! bruce's voice is terrible on this record. Somewhere in time,piece of mind,7th son kill this album. The worst album in there ""golden age."" I'm disappointed in you maiden fans. Rime is OK but way to boring, flash of the blade is cool until that corny extra cheesy riff kicks in, losfer words and song 6 (forget the title) are totally unlistenable! I've noticed that maiden can craft goose bump songs that are excellent and really corny stuff to. This cd has alot of corny riffs on it. A must for maiden fans but the worst from the golden age-or maybe number of the beast is worse. Bottom line OVERATED!!"
2,iron maiden power slave,These enhanced cds are awsome I owen them all! The sound is Incredable Its the best remasters out there! That I know of. You all so get videos for you to play on your pc! It rocks and its cool!
1,One of Iron Maiden's best,"This is probably my favorite Iron Maiden album. The highlights are Aces High, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Powerslave, Back in the Village, and the Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Buy it now!"
4,Epic Maiden,"Epic Album is powerslave, though a little overblown. A little Inconsistent, though still a solid 4 or 4.5 stars."
3,powerslave,"My favorite song on this CD skips. Only reason to buy the CD, my copy of the CD was old and every song skipped in my car CD player. Still, not a bad buy."
3,Weak In the Middle,"I love the first 2 songs. I love the last 2, as well. But, for the life of me, no matter how many times I've heard this album, none of the middle 4 tracks jump out at me. They are just okay, perhaps below average. I have just about every Maiden album, too. I know their classic work and new release material. The middle 4 songs off Powerslave are just filler, plain and simple.However, tracks 1,2,7,8 are astounding. 2 Minutes, Powerslave, & Rhyme are easily in my Top Ten Maiden songs of all time.In summary, this album could have been phenomenal had the inner 4 tracks had some merit to them. For this reason alone, I have to rate the album a 3 star. Sadly, it could have been (and should have been) so much more."
5,One of the best,"I really like this album, It's really one of the best early Iron Maiden albums, every song is really great and they are all 5/5 rated by me. I think this album is a little better than all the earlier albums, but somewhere in time and Seventh son is just as good as this one."
4,must have!!,"this is a must have for any Maiden fan. Iron Maiden was in the slot with Powerslave. With 'Aces High and 2 Minutes to Midnight' leading the charge and ending with the epic 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner.' While not their most influential album, that goes to Number of the Beast, this could be their best album."
5,The Glory of 84'!!!!!,"In my opinion the defining moment of metal in the 80s.Yes there certainly are a number of great bands from that era of metal but I believe Maiden not only peaked as a band on this effort but topped the genre.This is an immaculate product for that time,way ahead of its time and still to this day as good,if not better than anything that has followed by any hard rock or metal band.Musically precise and artistically genius.Need I mention Dickinson's vocal performance on this effort.A flawless 5 Star across the board.Call me nostalgic but when this was first released in 84'I purchased it on audio cassette and knew at that time that history was made...."
4,Fast Paced Maiden!!,"The first 2 tracks ""Aces High"" and ""2 Minutes 2 Midnight"" just blow you away. If the CD had only those 2 tracks... I would still buy it. I wouldn't complain about the length of #8 (""Rime of the Ancient Mariner"") beacuase many of Maiden's songs are just as long. ""Dream of Mirrors"", ""Fear of the Dark"", ""The Clansman"", and ""Hallowed be thy Name"" all range from 7-12 minutes!! I think longer songs are better 80% of the time because they have more variety of riffs and more time to expirement and make some nasty solos and rolls. If you dont have this album Get It!!!"
5,slave to the power of maiden!,"Oh mama! this album is it. the opener of aces high > 2 minutes are a maiden flurry of excitement! then the instrumental losf'r words is awesome and highlights steve on the bass. flash of the blade and back in the village are great little rock tunes. the 2 power songs to close out the album are vintage maiden at its best. Powerslave is a great lengthy song where in the live version, a mummy eddie comes out and walks on stage for awhile. Rhyme is a 10+ minute choon that is based off some book. It contains a middle section akin to that of seventh son of a seventh son"
5,Cats like it,I have two Ragdoll cats and use this shampoo on both of them. After using this shampoo my cats no longer smell like cat and it gets rid of the lose cat hair and dander.
2,"Yeah, Okay!","Two stars 'cos it's an Ac/Dc album. If any other band had recorded Stiff Upper Lip, i would've given it the full five stars! I've been tryin' to discover what makes this album worse than the others, i still son't know. It's just that there's no variation in the songs, no energy. Somethin's missin'. But anyway, you can't stop 'em!"
2,ac/dc-stiff upper lip,"This record is same old, same old. The need a drummer that can play a second beat. Time to retire boys."
1,Same sh** ...different day!,"Haven't these guys heard the phrase,""quit while you're ahead! "" Boring, boring, boring. They obviously ran out of lyrics after the first verse in the first song! I play there music with my band every weekend, but none of these tunes will find there way into our set list!"
1,boring rock,"This is by far the worst cd from anti christ-devil`s child.To say that this cd blows is a gross understatement.I cannot believe all the clone reviews out there.5 stars,are you out of your(mind),i use the term mind losely."
3,Should have been called Ballbreaker 2,"I am a big fan of the boys down under. I do enjoy this album but it is not a Back In Black or Highway To Hell effort. I mean come on, there are NO drinking songs! The cuts are crisp and Brian seems to have got his voice back but for the most part it is just filler music. The songs Can't Hold Me Back, Can't Stand Still and Give It Up are the only tunes that really get the blood flowing. A bad effort from AC/DC is better than a good effort form most other bands, and this is not a bad effort, it's just for this band, this special band, it's an average effort."
2,No surprises...unfortunately,"Like many people I can practically trace my identity to AC/DC. I came of age in the late 70s and early 80s buying up every album I could lay my hands on. In my opinion, there has never been a better front man in the history of rock and roll than Bon Scott. But the boys really came back strong with Back In Black, and followed it well with For Those About To Rock. In the 19 years since the latter album, they have recorded about three songs that are worth a damn, and it kills me to say that this new effort doesn't improve upon that track record at all. I will be first in line to see them live, but I hope they stick to the great old stuff."
2,Kinda dull.,"AC/DC is one of the best bands of all times, but there just getting little old. They cant rock like they used too. At least there making money!"
4,Thunder From Down Under Still Rules,"I'm glad to see that some thinks don't change, especially when their not broke. AC/DC is straight ahead rock n' roll and Stiff upper Lip is exactly that. Classic AC/DC. The lyrics are some what repetitive, but we all know that's not what AC/DC is about. Stiff Upper Lip the title track, along with Meltdown, Hold me back, and Give it up are some that will grab you right away. I think Give It Up will be released as a single, it's got Classic AC/DC good times written all over it.Keep it up boys!!"
1,horrible album,"everysong on this album is brutally bad.agnus young's guitar still sounds great but brian johnson's vocal's on this cd is horrific.is this really the same guy who sang vocals on back in black?the song stiff upper lip is the lamest song i ever heard ac/dc performed.if this is the best material they can produced,then maybe it's time they called it a career."
3,"Pretty Rockin, but...","Brians voice isn't as great as it once was in Geordie or early ac/dc days. The songs sound fine, but a little lack luster. Don't get me wrong it's still great...at least they never turned to total b.s. like Rose Tattoo did."
2,Stiff Upper Lip,"I mainly bought this album because I was going to see them on this tour. In fact the gig I was at was the opening show on the tour. Again, the band uses their patented formula basically creating the same album over and over again. I find most of this album to be very average. Actually after listening, this album is not very good at all. The majority of the songs are cliché ridden in both music and lyrics. There are a couple of catchy tracks most notably ""Safe In New York City"" which is a bit different but most of this album is cock rock at its most basic. Probably one of the bands weakest efforts."
5,This CD Rocks!,"AC/DC has put out a lot of good cds, but this is definitely one of their best. This album goes back the days of Back in Black and Highway to Hell. Stiff Upper Lip is what real rock is all about. The blues-based hard-edged rock n' roll sound of Angus Young blasts out of the speakers on every song. This is good rock n' roll without all the modern effects and sounds that could spoil a good record. This is pure hard rock at it's best. If you ever considered liking AC/DC, buy this album and you'll wonder why you've never listened to them before because this will blow you away."
3,Disappointing album,Album is somewhat disappointing. Not up to AC/DCs usual standards. They are living off their old reputation rather than putting out a quality product.
3,Again they deliver hard rock,"You can't go wrong with expectations from AC/DC...they deliver what you purchase, hard rock with loud bangin sound and tunes to keep you rockin while you drive and partyin, drinking"
1,ACDC are now completly dead,"I don't have a problem with ac/dc, (Except that Brian Johnston can't sing worth a damn), they have a cool sound, but this album is old, They need some new material. They WERE a great band in the Bon Scott days, and even Back in Black was great, but they're getting old, and should give it up pretty soon, or at least experiment a bit. I sure hope they get back to Back in Black fourm."
1,Stop It Already!,"Ac/Dc was popular in the 70's and 80's.When people wore tight pants and listened to two bands with music for the brain dead.The music was rock.The bands?Metallica and AC/DC.The songs are about....what? can somebody answer that? Please....AC/DC made good CD's in the 80's.Hang it up and dont embarass yourself. And for the 40 year old people who bought this,or are going to,save your money.GOOD JOB AC/DC,BUT NOW IT'S TIME TO QUIT."
2,STIFF UPPER BOMB,"GARBAGE.THAT IS A GOOD WORD FOR THIS.ALOT OF THROW AWAY SONGS AND VERY FEW KEEPERS.THIS IS NOT AC/DC IN THERE PRIME ANY MORE.THAT WAS LOST WAY BACK IN THE SEVENTIES WITH GREAT RELEASES LIKE LET THERE BE ROCK,HIGHWAY TO HELL AND DIRTY DEEDS.OH,HOW I WISH BON SCOTT COULD COME BACK AND RESCUE THIS SAD SACKS SINKING SHIP.STAY AWAY FROM THIS RELEASE,IF YOU NEED TO HEAR BRIAN JOHNSON,GET BACK IN BLACK.ALL SONGS ON THIS ARE THE SAME."
5,Best ACDC Album in Years,"The good old ACDC is back. Definitely as good as some of the best stuff they have ever done. Out of the 12 songs on the album, 10 are just TOP QUALITY and just kick-a$$. Instead of getting the usual album with 2 to 3 good songs on it, you get 10 of them. The only song that should not have been part of this album is ""Safe in New York City"". Words are lame and so is the music. If you are an ACDC fan, this is what you've been waiting for."
2,Rehash,"All this album features is AC/DC re-writing songs they already wrote. At least that's what it seems. Everything sounds like we heard it somewhere before. There are some good songs on the album however, but not enough to give it more than 2 stars."
3,One can not reasonably rate it five stars....,"IF we have a rating system that ranges from five stars (the best) to 1 star (the worst), one AC/DC fan simply cannot rate Stiff Upper Lip five stars, because that would mean that this album is so good as BACK IN BLACK, FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK, POWERAGE, LET THERE BE ROCK, the live IF YOU WANT BLOOD YOU'VE GOT IT.... and this is simply not true!!The album is not a disgrace at all, but is plain for all to hear that Johnson's voice is gone for sure. Even Phil Rudd's drumming is lacking in energy, his best trademark. The filler material is in enormous amount, since there are 12 songs, too much for their actual creativity. Angus solos are just run of the mill.Of course, in this age of manufactured ""artists"" like Backstreet Boys and Britney Whatever, it's always a comfort to know that a sheer rock and roll band like AC/DC still are capable of releasing solid hard rock albums.But STIFF UPPER LIP is not a 5 stars album at all!"
2,I disagree with EVERYBODY here!,"I've been listening to AC/DC for over 20 years.The songs on this particular album offer none of the uniqueness that makes any song a hit.I agree only with the fact that the sound of this CD is ac/dc, but the songs are way too dry and bland.Their previous CD was only slightly better than this one.If you want a good ac/dc album, try these more distinctive flavors of post Bon Scott ac/dc:Back in BlackThe Razor's Edge."
1,STOP !,"I have had enough of AC/DC.As a matter of fact, I have had enough of all rock music.I had to listen to this CD two times over,so i know what it sounds like.""Stiff Upper Lip"" is a senseless song,as with all AC/DC songs,ever since ""She Got Balls"" from the ""High Voltage"" Cd.And,all of the songs start out with the same sound,like they are scared to try something different.Brian Johnson can't sing,and the Angus brothers have really bad songwriting abilities.AC/DC NEEDS TO QUIT."
3,Gets old after a while but its a good listen.,"This album will be on constant spin in your cd player for aroiund a month then it will only make it out on rare occasions. Its a good album but lacks the giant sing along choruses that make AC/DC so great. I find it hard to believe that a so called ""fan since '78"" would make the asinine remark ""how about a drum roll phil?."" DUHH when was the last time you heard a drum fill on an AC/DC record? This comment makes about as much sense as a three legged race horse."
4,They did it again,"My favorite AC/DC is still AC/DC live, but their newest album is still great. I couldn't give the album as a whole 5 stars simply because some of their songs sound way too similar and their are a few songs that rank as just decent.Stiff Upper Lipe, Safe in NYC, and Damned are 3 of my favorites. I definately would recommend this too any AC/DC fan, especially those that have somes blues running through their veins."
3,"Not their best, nor their worst","AC/DC keep their musical direction intact, so you won't be surprised. The material on ""Stiff upper lip"" is better than on the previous ""Ballbreaker"" since the band seem to have put more effort in the song writing. But singer Brian Johnson is not in top form on this release, and the fact is that his voice have gradually got worse ever since ""Back in black"". When it comes to AC/DC - what you see is what you get - and critics may say that the band is writing the same song over and over again. In some way that might be true, and if you're not a dedicated fan, I believe you'll do fine with just a couple of albums from this band. Try out ""Highway to hell"" (the last album with Bon Scott) and ""Back in black"" (the first one with Brian Johnson). They represent AC/DC in the prime!"
4,Still rocking after all these years,"Okay--no new ground is broken here, but we didn't expect it to be anyway. There will never be another ""Back In Black"", but that's what will always make that album one of the alltime special albums in rock history. That doesn't mean this still doesn't rate with other AC/DC efforts. As numerous others have indicated, one of AC/DC's trademarks is consistency, and there is no exception here. The title track is a great rocker to lead off the album, and ""Meltdown"" keeps the pace going early in the album. The other track I have heard on the radio off this album is ""Satellite Blues"", which is a standout, rocking track. A few of the tracks are more average, but all are more than listenable for longtime fans. As with virtually any AC/DC album, you really can't go wrong with this one."
2,Perhaps their worst ever,"As an avid AC/DC and owner of every one of their US/domestic albums (except Who Made Who), this is, in my opinion, the weakest and worst album produced. It is extremely slow, lacks energy, and sounda like it was written and recorded during a weekend session. I ask all AC/DC fans: what album is worse than SUL? I give it 2 stars only becuase of the title song, the NY song, and their previous accomplishments."
2,No imagination,"AC/DC is no doubt one of the best rock bands of all time, but they are not growing as musicians. Sure, they can rock like they used too, but they seem to be out of ideas. The well is dry. Put out a anthology already!!! At least my favorite band Deep Purple keep coming up with good stuff, and with imagination! The fact that Purple's music continues to fascinate as well as puzzle after all this time is evidence we are dealing with art of the highest caliber.Anyway, better luck next time Angus & Co.Stiff Upper Lip~ AC/DC : 2 stars"
4,This is another good one,"I can describe AC/DC's music with one word -- unpretentious. There's no attempt at a profound statement. No whining. No sappiness. If you're looking for those three, look somewhere else. This is just honest hard-driving blue collar rock. Now add some blues and you get a great blend. Angus Young's sizzling solos once again highlight this album. Malcolm is as solid as ever. Brian Johnson's vocals gritty vocals provide a perfect balance. Phil Rudd returns on drums, and Cliff Williams on bass. No wonder I keep going back to this group. This album needs to be accompanied by a Cooper's Pale and a meat pie."
2,Ac/dc 17 albums that all sound the same,"I like Ac/Dc as much as the next guy but come on. Everyone of these songs sound similiar. Same bass line, same drum beat played at different tempos, Angus Young playing his ""look at me solos"", and above it all,tone deaf Brian Johnson croaking out asinine lyrics and repeating the song titles 20 times.This album sounds like the unused material from Ballbreaker only worse. Ac/Dc used to be fresh and original back in the 70's and early 80's, but now they just need to give it up, or at least put out an all instrumential album."
1,A late 90s flop from AC/DC,"I remember this CD coming out around 1999, and at that time I thought it was the worst album AC/DC ever made. Now it is seven years later and I still think the same thing. AC/DC sounds burnt out and over the hill, as if they've ran out of good material, and are now just putting out a bunch of half @ssed filler to keep the royalties coming in. The music is boring, and the lyrics are dumb: ""I keep a stiff upper lip"", and then they rhyme that with ""I shoot from the hip"". How much thought would it take to come up with a song like that? It sounds like AC/DC just threw this half @ssed garbage together in a couple of days! ""Stiff Upper Lip"" is a perfect example of an old band that used to be good, but is now past their prime and has lost their edge. It's hard to believe this is the same band that brought us such classics as ""Highway to Hell"" and ""Back in Black"". They've really gone downhill in the last 10 to 15 years."
1,CAUTION:Extreme Low Voltage!,"please follow this warning and disconnect this cd immediately! this is the worst album by ac/dc to date.a full refund should be given to anyone ,who was foolish enough to buy it.plus a little something extra for pain and suffering!"
3,because 3 of the 5 members still work,"i've heared the album twice and have read the other reviews. i'm convinced that John should take a break and go to have his throat revised,and Phil must buy some Led Zepplin records to learn how to hit the drums. so, this ablum is a good one in songwriting but it sucks the performance. you see: 25 years doing a same album this is something really..... if i have good memory, ACDC never wins any academic prize,and that's good: no artist should waste 25 years to continue a Genius record long-session to make a string of 12-disc-packed album."
4,Fine craftsmanship,"There may be nothing on this album as instantly recognizable as ""Highway To Hell"" or ""You Shook Me All Night Long"", but the riffs are catchy and George Young completely out-produces Rick Rubin (who did ""Ballbreaker"").The songs flow smoothly with no great high points and no need to program out any bad songs either, and that's actually quite an achievement. The music is a bit bluesier than usual, and if most of the choruses are less memorable than some of AC/DC's best work, ""Stiff Upper Lip"" seems a more mature record (or less immature, anyway), without being introvert or lacking in energy.All in all, I'd say that among the Brian Johnson-era albums, only ""Back In Black"" and ""The Razor's Edge"" are significantly better records than this one. And that's actually pretty great praise!"
5,These old guys still got it.,"Well what can I say, it's by far the best album since Flick of the switch. From the loud riffs to the even louder solos, it shows that even though they are getting on a bit they still rock better than all this so called rock today.ROCK ON!"
3,You Can't Stop Rock n Roll~!,"This Australian-Only Import is the one to get if you can. This Double-Disc CD includes 5 Live version songs from the shows in Madrid, Spain, and 3 videos of the singles. While we anxiously await the new release of ""Black Ice"", this album, recorded in 2000, was a simple and strait-forward return to the basics. ""Stiff Upper Lip"" has the trademark attitude and energy of the band as it moved into the new century. It must be noted that AC/DC has never 'experimented' or changed their image or sound to 'fit-in' with the latest music trends. For example,Metallica tried to go for a new image and sound twice- with disasterous results.The Boys from down-under have always been honest to their fans. This album doesn't rock as hard or loud as their early 80's stuff, but that's ok. They have nothing to prove to anyone. Just plain hard rock without any gimmicks or tricks. AC/DC rocks!"
4,"Not their best album, but still great....","While some may say this a filler album, I disagree. Sure, it isn't as good as Back In Black, Powerage, Highway To Hell, and other older albums, but this is one of the best albums AC/DC has put out in awhile. That being said, this album is VERY different from the last few. The album is a lot more bluesy than past albums. ""Stiff Upper Lip""(one of AC/DC's best songs EVER!), ""Meltdown"", ""Hold Me Back"", ""Safe In New York City""(the chorus does get a bit annoying), ""Satellite Blues"", and ""Give It Up"" are all great songs. If your a casual fan, get the 70s and 80s stuff first, but this is a must have for the hardcore AC/DC fan!"
5,Rock N Roll Ain't noise Pollution!,"AC/DC proves again why they are ROCK N ROLL giants. With a stong single ""Stiff Upper Lip"" and awesome tracks like ""Safe In New York City"" & Satallite Blues this album is a real ROCK N ROLL winner all the way threw."
4,A great album from one of Rock's best!,"I'm not going to lie, this isn't exactly AC/DC's best. BUT! If you have bought pretty much all of AC/DC's CDs and you are missing out on this one you should really consider buying it! It has some flaws but a lot of good points to. Meltdown was a good song. Stiff Upper Lip, the title track was pretty great!You should get this if you want a good album by AC/DC but if you're just starting your rock collection or your AC/DC collection you should get Highway to Hell or Back in Black first. While its not their best, its just as good if not better than some of their other stuff (and its much better than the music that playson theradio today)!"
5,YOU CAN'T STOP ROCK AND ROLL!,"How would Brian Johnson's voice sound, 20 years after Back In Black? What would AC/DC do differently this time? Would they have a big hit on this album? These are questions that I and a lot of others had before buying this CD, but I forgot them soon after because this CD rules! Johnson's voice is still high and explosive, and AC/DC blended their blues roots with hard rock. Can't Hold Me Back is an underrated hit. The title track is pure AC/DC power. All AC/DC fans must get this CD or they will have an incomplete collection."
2,Why is anyone surprised?,"AC/DC has a secret that they have to selling a shizbot or records: They keep putting the same songs on every album. So good reviewers, are you really that immersed in your AC/DC fandom? And fans who put in bad reviews, why are you surprised? Every album is the same album, people. Trust me, this is the case. Not to mention that Angus is a very overrated guitar player. Anyway, don't be surprised that this album lacks originality, because the only original one was the first one."
2,Better back in the 70s,"AC/DC was a very good band in the 70s but when Bon Scott died the legend left many though. Till the 80s when they met Brain Johnson who brought the band back. Back in Black was a very good Album,and not many bands write a song to their old friend who passed away. Back In Black was the song to Bon. Angus Young is known as one of the best guitar players who can only play 3 chords I heard. I respect them for still playing at this age they are at, but the newer alubum isnt so good. I am not saying they went down,I still love them alot.."
1,AC/DC's worst album!,"I'm an AC/DC fan,but I must say that ""Stiff Upper Lip"" ranks among one of the worst albums I have ever heard.Most of the songs have the AC/DC sound,but none of them have anything special that makes them stand out,basically it's all filler,the songs are bland.I think their starting to have the same trouble they had from 81-91 not writing very strong material."
2,Weakest AC/DC album yet,"I love AC/DC and I was very excited when this album came out mainly because they have not recorded an album with new matierial in 3 or 4 years. I was very disappointed! Brian Johnson's voice is wearing out and it shows on this album especially in the live songs(I bought the Stiff Upper Lip DVD too.) Angus and Malcom's riffs aren't that catchy!Stiff Upper Lip is the best song and after that there aren't anymore songs that will stick in your head or even make you think, hay that was pretty good."
5,Still the best rock band on the planet!,"Ya can't hold 'em back! Once again, AC/DC manages to push the rock 'n roll envelope. This new album has a whole lotta hard rock mixed in with some blues. A little bit of Back In Black with a little bit of Ballbreaker. Angus can not be stopped! This British bloak has got to be the best guitar player that ever lived! And he continues to show it in their umpteenth album! If you've got that AC/DC blood running through your veins like I do, you HAVE to pick up this album."
5,A Classic,"First customer to review this album, huh? I agree with amazon.com's reviewer, AC's last few albums have been inconsistent. A few standout songs, a few good songs, and some filler. This album is different. Each track is a standout, you will have a difficult time picking a favorite. This album is a return to form; less metal and more rock and roll and riffage and rhythm galore. This one ranks as one of Angus and Co.'s very best ever. Come and Get It!"
4,Very Good,"AC/DC's newest cd is up to par with much of their older stuff. While I don't think it is quite as good as Back in Black, I would still say it is one of their best."
2,AN OFFENSE !!,"To say that all AC/DC albuns are the same is an offense, even if Angus himself may have said it sometime. It's an offense, because it would mean that mediocre albuns like this STIF, BALLBREAKER, FLY ON THE WALL, etc are in the same league as all Bon Scott's albuns and BACK in BLACK and FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK."
4,Nice comeback,"Real rock for real rock fans. Good hard blues/rock sound. Brian is screeching and the guitars and drums sound great. Lots of good hooks. What else can you ask for? Actually, here's one thing: The CD is write-protected. Anyone know how to burn this thing?"
1,SO BAD IT MADE ME SICK...,"I'm a huge AC/DC fan. SO, I waited eagerly for the last four years for their new release. Oh, what a disapointment! NOthing saves himself in this lousy album, which seems a mockery to fans. It is clear the band no longe cares in composing great simple rock songs. Instead, they simplified it to the point of sheer mediocrity. Brian Johnson completely lost his vocals. Well, it's the same thing as with other bands like Iron Maiden, Sabbath, etc.. they go on living by their names, while fans keep awaiting for their new ""masterpieces"", which never comes..."
2,MORE OF THE SAME,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF AC/DC SINCE 1975 WITH THE BON SCOTT DAYS.THIS CD IS MORE OF THE SAME FROM BALLBREAKER,AN O.K. CD BUT NOTHING TO GET EXCITED ABOUT.HARD CORE FANS LIKE MYSELF SHOULD BUY THIS BUT IF YOU ARE NEW TO AC/DC DON`T START WITH THIS ONE,TRY LET THERE BE ROCK OR BACK IN BLACK."
1,To Old to Rock?,"It appears to me that the die hard fans would have given 5 stars to anything. I have every AC/DC album, and bought this one the day it came out. That first day, I could barely make it through the first listen. I kept waiting for each and every song to kick in, but none did. Very repetitive and very flat. I have tried to listen to it since, but just can't. Definitely a dust collector."
1,"It seems a follow-up to BALLBREAKER, but it is worse !","Brian Johnson definitely lost the few ammount of vocals he had. Phil Rudd is playing lousy drums, it sucks. Face the truth: AC/DC is gone since ""FOR THOSE ABOUT TO ROCK"", their last great album. You'll be dissapointed listening to this, after 4 years without recording one would think they would come back better, but that's not the case..."
4,High Energy!,"Despite to my first opinions of this album, I've really grown to like it. I think this kind of album grows on you. Much better than BallBreaker definitly. The guitir riffs are catchy and Phill and Cliff have a really solid foundation. Brian's voice isn't what it used to be, but its better in my opinion than on BallBreaker. For age, he's doing great. Great album!"
2,DISAPPOINTING ...,"I'm a huge AC/DC fan. It's my favourite album. I have hundreds of rock albuns in my collection. I admire the fact that AC/DC never cared about other people's opinions, they just went forward, delivering good old rocking. And they are loyal guy, too. But I beg them: if they are going to continue, replace Brian Johnson. They can always give some kind of big check to reapy for losses and Brian will go on collecting his albuns'royalties. My God, he just doesn't sing in this CD !!! His voice is gone !!! Myself could be singing here !!! It seems a cat screaming trapped inside a bag !!! Gooosh !!!"
4,"AC/DC, doing what they do best","AC/DC has finally released a album worth buying;after Razors Edge AC/DC seemed to fade away from the spotlight.Isnt kinda weird they release a incredible album and after that they come out with sorry ones but 10 years later they release yet another great album?Every song on here is pure gold and nice to jam to all the way from Stiff Upper Lip to Give It Up.But I do agree with some people when they say Brian Johnson has lost his screaming voice.But as always,my favorite guitarist Angus,never lets you down.From the beginning to the end his solos and riffs are unbelievable but if you are looking for his best work check out Highway to Hell."
5,5 months and still 5 stars,"One listener stated that in five months this album would be back in my cd cabinet. They stated"" because it was new, I liked it"" Well listen, AC/DC continues to forge ahead. It is still in my car, my CD palyer...in other words, it still kicks buttocks. Hard rock and roll has become less and less poplular lately, as hard as it is to admit. Thank GOD for AC/DC. They keep playing hard Rock and Roll despite the changing of the times. THANK GOD FOR AC/DC...FOR WITHOUT THEM, WHERE WOULD ROCK BE? I AM SO HAPPY THAT AC/DC IS STILL PLUGGING AWAY. THEY ROCK THE SAME WAY THEY DID 25 YEARS AGO, AND IT STILL KEEPS MY FIST AND HEAD PUMPIN.....THANK GOD FOR AC/DC."
5,Hard Rocking Power,"I'm not a big AC/DC fan. After seeing them on Saturday Night Live, they seemed like a very talented rock band. I purchased Stiff Up Lip, and I like it. The title track just blows you away. Angus and the boys take one step further with Hold Me Back. This cd changed my mind about this band. Now I got to get Razor's Edge and Ballbreaker."
2,"Unimaginative, but the boys still rock","To quote an old interview, when Angus was questioned about a critic's comment that all of AC/DC's 11 albums sound the same, Angus replied ""That's a bloody lie! We've made 12 albums!"" It is indeed more of the same, at least over these past 10 years or so. The title track is kind of fun, and there aren't any bad songs. Good rhythms, good solos, Brian Johnson's trademark growl... the lyrics are very light. The double entendres are not as humorous as I had hoped, and the rock and roll attitude is not as high as these boys are capable of. I suspect when I see them perform, these songs will sound a lot better, but I also hope that they only play one or two cuts from this record and fill the show with their classic stuff. To anyone that hasn't seen AC/DC in concert, GO! They are the funnest, most entertaining rock and roll band in the world."
4,AC/DC ROCKS Y2K,"AS THE MILLANIUM APPROCHED TEEN POP AND BOY BANDS RAN RAMPID,THAT WAS UNTIL THE WORLD GOT A SHOT OF GOOD OL' ROCK&ROLL;AC/DC'S STIFF UPPER LIP IS A GOOD ALBUM WITH AN AWSOME TITLE TRACK AND MONSTOROUS RIFFS BY THE WORLDS OLDEST SCHOOL BOY ANGUS YOUNG,SURE BRIAN JOHNSONS VOICE ISNT WHAT IT USED TO BE BUT THE SONGS ROCK,REAL BLUES INFLUENCED R&R;,HAS GREAT SONGS STIFF UPPER LIP,MELTDOWN,CANT STAND STILL,HOLD ME BACK,SAFE IN NEW YORK CITY,SATELLITE BLUES.12 TRACKS WAS A BIT OF OVER KILL,BUT HEY BEATS THE CRAP OUT OF THE OTHER STUFF OUTHERE,NO PUNK,POP,DEATH METAL JUST ROCK & ROLL!and hey at least they dont pull a aerosmith and realese a greatest hits record every year"
5,Outstanding book on leadership,"One of the best books on leadership I have ever read. The four brief biographies (on Moses, David, Paul and Jesus) that make up the first part of the book are extremely insightful and practical. McNeal writes with authenticity and clarity. There's not a lot of ""fluff"" or stuff that's rehashed from one leadership book to another. Every chapter is well worth a slow read. His dry wit also adds some spice to the read. Very good stuff."
1,Absolutely Awful,"I really don't need to say much more that the title for this review. Absolutely awful! The concepts weren't terrible, but the author obviously has no reverence for scripture. It would seem that his approach to the Word of God is assumption. He draws lines that simply do not exist and are not taught in the passages he references. For example: He claims that Moses was a good leader when he realized that he wasn't good and public speech and asked to take his brother Aaron along. Anyone can see by reading the Bible that it just didn't happen that way. God was calling Moses to go free his people from slavery in Egypt, and Moses was using every excuse in the book to get out of it. It was at that point that GOD told Moses that he would give him Aaron to convince Moses to obey. Scriptural inaccuracies abound throughout this book. Do not read it!I feel bad for this author. I would not want to be the one who stands before God and have him ask me why I treated his word with such disrespect."
3,Thoroughly Detailed,"This text was a mandatory read for seminary. I found much of the text useful and insighful. The author gets a bit 'bogged-down' in the details which can drag along the experience. The reader must be patient while reflecting on and praying over the concepts. If you are patient, you will be rewarded."
5,One of my favorite books!!!,"This is the second time I have purchased this book. I loaned my first one out and never got it back, so I bought it again to keep in my personal library. If you want to grow as a Christian leader read this book."
1,This book is useful only for revenge on a close friend.,"This is a pamphlet at best, puffed up to book size by inane, unrelated cartoons and half-pages of print. Its grammar and syntax are deplorable. Most of the means of revenge that it offers require access to the victim's property that would only be afforded to a close friend. It might be useful in destroying a close relationship if one doesn't mind being the only suspect for the vengeful act. Most of the remaining methods are more like puerile dreams of getting even rather than practical courses of action."
1,SOPHOMORIC TRASH,"This was the most mean-spirited book I've ever read. Expecting practical jokes, I found felonious stunts that could easily land you in jail. I wouldn't think of recycling it in any way. Straight to the garbage it goes. Shame on you, Gary Brodsky, as well as the publisher of this trash."
2,Top 100 Golf Teachers,I purchased this set as a present and I was told their were to many of the same teachings from one DVD to another!
5,Sublime,"This is an absolutely sublime, deeply moving recording. I was hooked the first time I heard it, and my appreciation of it keeps growing. I've been sitting here at the computer trying to write down why I think this is a good recording, but I can't express it in words. The combination of Mahler and Baker produce something that is profound and compelling. That's the best that I can describe it."
3,"Unexpected Tags, otherwise fine","I usually order good quality used items on purpose, because that is the green thing to do. When I received my CD, there were some unexpected library tags on the case and booklet. It's not a big deal but since I was giving this CD as a gift, I would like to have known in advance. They were a bit tricky to pull off and I did have to damage the booklet a little bit. However the music is lovely so it will all be good."
3,"Actually, I Found The Book Lacking Quite a Bit.","If you're contemplating purchase of this book, odds are, you already know something about the Cap Arcona tragedy. This book won't teach you much more. This was written from one survivor's perspective, and regrettably, a lot of the book deals with life in the camps and the march to the Cap Arcona rather than the sinking or the attack itself. It takes a painfully long time to get to the attack on the ship, and once there, the details are slim and as I stated, from only one rather limited perspective. This one's worth getting if it's on sale, but the photos are poor and this book doesn't do the 5,000 plus victims of the Cap Arcona justice. Both books on the Wilhelm Gustloff sinking are far superior to this much larger volume."
3,"Good quality for an inexpensive product - lenses are ""smoke"" sunglass lenses - ""clear"" lenses not available!","The illustration made it seem to me, on my screen, like the lenses were clear. But even though the package itlself lists a number of lens colors available (including clear) the one I exchanged for was also ""smoke"". So I have concluded that this item is only available here in ""smoke"" lenses. I have also been told that if lenses are ""polaroid"" there must be some kind of tint on them to create the polarizing effect, whether it's gray, brown, light yellow, or any other color. In this case, if ""smoke"" color sunglass lenses are what you're looking for, I would say these are a good buy for the monay."
2,very uncomfortable for anything beyond 1 hour use,leaves marks on my nose bridge and it is very uncomfortable to use with ear muffs. I do not recommend it.
4,Does the job but cracked,This product covers the eyes from all angles and the polarized lenses are great to have on sunny days. I have worn them at times for more than 6 hours without any discomfort. I wear clear safety glasses regularly so I am aware of how uncomfortable some products are. I have 2 pairs of these and haven't noticed any distortion in the vision. The only problem with these is the fact that one day I found a crack on the outer edge of lens. I have no clue how it happened but I'm sure that they were not abused in any way. Having a safety glass crack like that isn't very comforting. I will post a picture of the crack to share with the community.
1,AVOID at all costs,"As a great fan of dog stories, I had enjoyed one of this author's tales excerpted in a dog story anthology, and thought that I might relish more of her work. Was I ever WRONG!!! Half or less of the book was related to canines, and then often remotely. Many of her works (this is a compendium of essays) are spoiled by her frequent use of the most vile, crude, and vulgar expletives, always unnecessary and adding nothing to the story. Although humorous on the rarest of occasions, this tome consists mainly of the mindless babblings of the typically self-loathing liberal. Unfit even as a chew toy for your pup!"
3,Why not ALL the mixes???,"feel sort of cheated by this single. there are several more mixes that were left off the single. Why couldn' they have released a big single that had all the mixes of this, as well as Colton's other track ""Everything""? At least that track is available on the soundtrack to his documentary ""Naked Fame"". I sure wish his stuff was more readily available so his transition from beautiful and talented porn star to adorable and talented singer would be easier."
4,A Ballad of Saxophones,Fantastic record of jazz with Mark Turner and Tad Shull on the saxophonessome times seams a dialogue some times seams a disput
3,A dissapointment from Heinlein,"As a huge fan of Heinlein's work, I was more than a little dissapointed with 'I Will Fear No Evil.' While many trademark Heinlein-type characters and moments can be found, it was definatley one of his slower moving novels with not much payoff at the end. The premise, though, is intriguing. A wealthy man dies and is still-living brain is placed in a females' body. If you are a fan of Heinlein and know what to expect from him, you might very well enjoy this novel. But if you are new to Heinlein, may I recomend 'Starship Troopers' or 'Revolt in 2100.'"
2,Dissapointing,"This is more a pamphlet than a book, really. I was excited by the title subject matter, but dissapointed when I got it because it was so ""thin"" in design information...the projects were ho-hum. Save your money."
2,waste of $,Thin book with pages of graphics printed again and again. Shows old quilt designs such as snails trail etc. Nothing much different.
5,"A brilliant book, a classic, buy it","Funny, informative, charming: this is one of the best books I've ever read.Brillat-Savarin was a French judge who barely escaped with his life during the Reign of Terror; to be able to write such a light-hearted, witty, fun book after such an ordeal is in itself a miracle. But The Physiology of Taste is more than a romp; it's a trip into the past. From a detailed inventory of the senses (including the 'generative sense' -- there's no mistaking the author's nationality!) to a description of a turkey hunt in New England while in exile, Brillat-Savarin's love of food, good company and beautiful women is a reminder to us that life can be good.I highly recommend this book."
4,"Important socially, historically, and culturally--but not aestetically","After reading some of the reviews concerning this book, I can certainly agree with much of the praise as well as the criticism. Filled with pithy euphimisms, chunks of this wonderful adventure in gastronomy are a revealing look at the life of the well-to-do author; other morsels seem be out of place, dry of wit, and ill-seasoned. Nonetheless, this is still a good read--there are some fascinating ancedotes as to life in the ""new"" United States which Savarin reports on after an adventure in the newly independent colonies. Worthy of any well-stocked bookshelf."
1,Picture Discs? Why?,Why did they have to go with the picture discs? Picture discs sound awful and these are no exception. I still have my old Maiden records from the 80's and these do not compare. They lack the punch and kick that the original vinyl had. I don't get it. Aren't the original album covers cool enough to look at? It's a shame.
3,???????,"The disc was outstanding quality with additional videos, however, I was misled to believe that the Cross Eyed Mary bonus track was supposed to be on there which was the main reason for my purchase."
5,Maiden rocks and so does this album,"Every song is epic. Bruce's voice is amazing, and the musicians are top-notch. Great lyrics, technical, interesting music compositions."
4,Like Spinal Tap... Except Not On Purpose,"I consider myself a gentleman and a scholar, and a big fat snob, to boot.Nonetheless, I say this without a trace of irony, and without apology:I love Iron Maiden.They're so lovably pretentious (and genuinely gifted) that I just can't seem to outgrow them.They are SO Spinal Tap, it's beautiful. Take ""To Tame A Land,"" for example, when Bruce screams the final bits of the opening verse:""In a time! When dinosaurs walked the Earth-""Heh.""When lands were swamp and caves WERE HOME!""Why does he scream ""WERE HOME""? Does ""were home"" really warrant such emphasis?Iron Maiden- grammatically incorrect, painfully earnest, completely bloated...And brilliant.Up the Irons!Heh."
5,Lose the ECD. Keep the music.,The album is a 10 star! But I could do with out the cheezy ECD features. The only good thing about the ECD is the band lineup. It's cool to see how they've evolved over the years. The video portion of the ECD is clunky and the audio hisses! (The straight CD audio ROCKS!!!) MAIDEN RULZE!!!!
5,SUPERB ONE THE BEST MAIDEN ALBUMS EVER,My fave song of maiden's on this disc is Revelations.Reason being.On the live after death album.Before they sing the full song.Bruce says something bout fredrick remington.Which I think is neat.Cause I am from the town where the fredrick remington home is was its a remington museum now.I just love revelations one the greatest songs of all times.Also another one I love it the trooper and flight of icarus.Flight of Icarus is such a sad song..up the irons for the greatest heavy metal band ever Iron Maiden.
3,Far from their Best,"In my humble opinion this is the most over-rated Maiden album out there. It starts off with Where Eagles Dare and Revelations; I have fallen asleep to these songs (and missed the beginning of Flight of Icarus). Then the album belts out three Maiden classics: The Trooper, Die with your Boots on and Flight of Icarus. Although the lyrics of Flight of Icarus are completely inane; the intro is simply amazing. The Trooper is the song that initially got me into Iron Maiden and Die With Your Boots on is also a rather good song. After that the album goes pretty much downhill. None of the songs after that are really memorable, except for the laughably bad Quest for Fire and Sun and Steel. The song based on the Dune books, To Tame a Land, would not have been so bad if the subject matter was not dreadful. (I hated the Dune books). This album has a very clear high point but then it strays away into mediocrity."
2,BLAH!!!,"I LOVE MAIDEN!!!!But this was not that good of an album.It was okay, but the only songs that I can say I like are:The Trooper, Flight Of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On, and Where Eagles Dare.If you want to get a Maiden album, get Number Of The Beast or Seventh Son of a Seventh Son."
5,Definitely a Masterpiece,"As a big Iron Maiden fan, I would have to say that this is my all time favorite album of theirs. This album, like the Seventh Son of a Seventh Son album is so unified and it fits perfectly together. This to me is the highest level of talent I have ever seen by them. The drumming on this album by Nicko McBrain on Where Eagles Dare is phenomenal. He really knows his stuff, and this was his 1st album with them! Other great well thought out songs would be Revelations, Flight of Icarus-one of my all time favorite Maiden songs, and Quest For Fire. I must say they really put their minds together for Piece of Mind, which is their #1 album hands down. Out of this World!!!!"
4,"Nightmares...!!!? Still Life, Still Good!","Iron Maiden had made a great success with Bruce Dickinson with their third album ""The Number of the Beast"". After that it was quite challenging to come up with new ideas. This was their fourth album. It is great - not so good as the third album but still good. It had it great moments - ""Flight of Icarus"", ""The Trooper"", ""Revelations"", and ""Where Eagles Dare"". Unfortunately there's such songs as ""Quest for Fire"", ""Still Life"", and ""Die With Your Boots on"". Especially ""Die With Your Boots on"" is horrible. It is in my opinion the worst Iron Maiden song in 80's. However, Sonata Arctica made a great cover version of it - which they released in Orientation EP. It is actually one of the few cover versions I think it's better than original. But back to Maiden...""Still Life"" is backwards sung ""Nightmares"". Very clever! But well...good metal otherwise. 80's Maiden was great!Stars: Flight of Icarus, Where Eagles Dare, The Trooper"
5,My Revelation,"I have to admit that the IM & Killers albums with Paul Di'Anno was my Iron Maiden and I didn't take to Number Of The Beast with then new upstart Bruce Dickinson. However after hearing NOTB, Hallowed Be Thy Name, Run To the Hills and 22 Acacia Avenue from friends (or fiends) I decided to take a chance on POM. This was the album that put me over into accepting Bruce Dickinson and attending the World Piece Tour solidified my allegiance!Understand that in the context of the time Metal-heads were very ardent and you had to earn their loyalty. Where Eagles Dare, Revelations, The Trooper, Flight of Icarus & Die With Your Boots On were immediate standouts for me. Overall the entire album is excellent! And of course Bruce went on to become the face of and record many great albums with IM.This was one of the definitive albums of my misspent youth and The New Wave of British Heavy Metal. Yes, The Number of the Beast went on to be one of their classics, but for me Piece of Mind was the ticket!"
3,Weak lyrically,"Another good album from Maiden. With strong beats in many songs with excellent rythmic guitars, a good example being ""the trooper."" A main problem to the album is its weak lyrical content, with the exception of ""revealations"" the messages of the songs soon get to be shallow and not as intresting. It is still worth a buy if intresting in Maiden"
5,Definitly one you'll want to listen to again,"When I first bought this album, I thought it was alright, and it became just another CD in my collection. After a while I decided to listen to it again and now I am so glad I did. I can't believe how I missed out on songs like ""Revelations"" and ""Still Life"". Now that I have listened to this CD more than once, I've realized that it is a really good album, and definitly worth buying."
5,Iron Maiden's Best!,This albumn is incredible! I've been listening to it for years and I still have not grown tired of it. Great from beginning to end; every song is flawless! This is one great heavy metal cd!
1,Oh please...,"Good god this cd sucks! (...) This cd is light as hell. Like 2 guitar riffs, some crappy english accent singing, then maybe another guitar riff. Please Im sick of you ""true""(aka wannabe)metal fans saying that bands like iron maiden, judas priest, are ""hardcore"". Blink 182 is heavier than iron maiden and judas priest combined."
4,Awesome!,"I haven't listened to this yet, but the packaging is awesome!!! If your a maiden fan like myself and you lost your vinyl from the 80's for whatever reason and you want to recapture your youth I recomend these with NEW packaging it is a win."
2,uninspiring,"The book lacks both technical details and inspirations. Contains several basic boreing projects so meticulously drawn line after line as for to be copied. The ""trompe l'oeil"" title is too ambitious either. Sorry to admit but very like other books offered."
5,An awesome one-of-a-kind collection,"If Poem about the Ukraine doesn't make you want to sign up, nothing will. If you got chill bumps watching Hunt for Red October, you've got to hear this album and find out what sort of blood runs through the Russian veins."
2,An awkward disagreement,"In the face of the approval I've been reading, I have to wonder it this is a problem with my CD player. The recording does not seem good at all. Bad actually. The same equipment seems to produce the 'Lord of the Rings' soundtrack just fine. So perhaps the referenced recording is not so good, eh?"
4,snow white costume,My grandaughter has had the dress on every day since opening the gift. I was able to find the Disney snow white shoes to go with it as well as the magic wand. She is three and I was glad to find it in the toddler sizes on line.
5,Love this tag,This tag is just as it looks and heavy metal - not lightweight aluminum. Bright colors. Really like this tag.
3,beautiful escape and adventure,I like Sapphire even better than her newest book DIAMOND. The characters are rich and memorable. The female character is strong of will and the male is strong of heart. More than a lovely romance.
4,satisfying story,"it's been a while since i last read this book - i've certainly read it more than once, and enjoyed it thoroughly each time. i lent my copy to my cousin recently, and she liked it a lot, too.the author does not focus exclusively on the horses, but develops the human characters very well also.[from the back]""When the colt is born, shoot it!"" orders the owner.Amy is horrified. Why would anyone want to kill a colt - especially Mia's. Mia is such a beautiful horse!""But her colt won't be a thoroughbred,"" explains Kiko, the ranch boy, ""and the owner won't have anything but thoroughbreds on his ranch.""Suddenly, Amy makes a desperate decision.""We won't let them kill the colt!"" she tells Kiko. ""We'll save it - no matter what we have to do!""191 pages."
5,This book is full of spirited poems for one and all.,"Honey, I Love is a great book. This is the book I most love written by Eloise Greenfield. Some of the poems in the book remind me of my life as a ""little kid"". I read this book in fourth grade and loved it ever since. This is a great book for young students, as well as, older ones. The poem in the book entitled, ""Honey, I Love"", is inspiring to me. I read that poem and feel as if I'm the little girl in the poem. The other poems are also very nice,inspiring, and unique. I would definetely reccommend this book to the young ones. I feel as if they could relate to it. I love this book. It is a wonderfully fantastic book and I commend Mrs. Eloise Greenfield for writing it. Mrs. Greenfield is a very talented writer. I hope to write children's books like her one of these days. ""Honey, I love"", I love this book HONEY!"
4,"From the ground up: the story of ""brother Van""","From The Ground Up: The Story of ""Brother Van"", Montana Pioneer Minister, 1848-1919m I bought this for my mom because she thought she new the author and as it turns out she did. She used to babysit his children"" way back when"" as she puts it. She also remembered hearing about a brother Van and singing some of his favorite songs at the church in Montana where she grew up. She really liked the book and i'm sure it brought back some memories that she had forgotten."
1,RIP OFF!,ALL THE DVDS FROM THIS RIP OFF COLLECTION ARE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LONG! AND VERY POORLY DONE! WHAT A RIP OFF! SHAME ON AMAZON FOR SELLING US JUNK LIKE THIS! ALL GLOBAL TREASURES DVDS ARE LESS THAN 10 MINUTES LONG! RIP OFF!
3,Audio Soul Project - Community (Remixed),"Audio Soul Project's Community Remixed has its ear set firmly on the dancefloor with these funky revisions of their Community album. The duo of Francois K and Rob Rives put a smooth, tech sheen to ""Community"" and Tony Thomas does the same to ""Native Method"" with some African drums thrown in. Joeski's spin on ""New Plateau"" highlight the jazzy elements, while Nathan Larsen's retake of ""Intrinsic"" is strangely bland. As with most club-oriented albums, Community Remixed doesn't lend itself well to home-listening, but even so, it'll be sure to get your toes tapping."
4,does the job,"Haven't used it a ton yet, but like the size and the tight fitting lid. Only 4 stars due to some slight staining that required a bit of cleaning effort after cooking a messy dish. I'd probably gotten too used to non-stick coatings."
5,The best alternative to All Clad,"I am starting to cook more but can't afford all of the All Clad cookware. This Cuisinart is a perfect alternative at more than half the price! I am amazed that its so easy to clean, even the toughest reduction sauces come out easily without any pre-soaking (like some other All clad cookware). Perfect for sauce, quick sautees, even oatmeal. I really love this product and am glad I didn't have to break the bank to buy it."
2,Too much care.,"When you read the instructions for this pan you learn that first, you can never use high heat when cooking in this pan. Secondly, it requires special handling for cleaning. Too much care for me."
4,Quality issue with the Multiclad Unlimited,"This pan (the 4-Quart Multiclad Unlimited) came in second only to the much, much more expensive All-clad 4-Quart on a Food Network cooking show. The pan is excellent in almost every respect with the exception that there is a nasty roughness on the edge of the handle. Almost everyone would have to return this defective pan. I happen to have all the tools of the polishing trades, so I can just smooth it out and polish the bad area. It is discouraging that so many products with good names are no longer able to adhere to good quality control procedures. I maybe old and slow, but when it is done, it is done right!"
5,bigL,very nice pan. The lid gets very hot. forgot to use potholder 1st time. That won't happen again. I like it a lot
2,Terrible,"This shin guard protects you well, but it slips VERY easy and it held by only one velcro strap. Don't buy this product!"
4,They Guard Shins,"What can I say, they are shin guards that guard shins. My son completed the season with no bruises. Strap is a bit on the long side and is not 100% velcro, so not infinitely adjustable. But, they worked and have a pretty cool Darth Vader look that he liked."
3,I know it's less money than other shin guards.,My sons complain about the tape to hold on are itchy when it touches their skin. Next time I'll buy different type of shin guard. But the price was okay.
4,Chin Guards,This is an excellent product! I had to buy longer socks because my little guy was getting scratched by the velcro but they worked awesome for a little mini-kickers soccer league!
2,Weak.,"Yes, the novel is included. No, none of the information provided was of much help. Granted, I was looking for some quick research or reference. Granted, I am not a high school student -- if you are, then yes, this might be of some value. As for its content in terms of being ""complete"" in relation to exploring its subject matter, it's really only paper-thin."
3,Too Many Typos,"The information in the book is helpful for holding a book club discussion, which is what I used it for. The research is interesting and greatly enhanced our discussion.For a published book, however, I was surprised at the number of typos. There is no excuse for this, especially from a publisher of this caliber."
4,A must have for any hardcore GW Fan!,"I have seen Great White 9 times and they pride themselves on putting on a great live show. This observation is further proven on both this cd as well as 'Stage'. The only reason why I did not give this cd 5 stars was I wish there would have been more songs on it...possibly even a double cd set. You figure that a majority of the people that will buy this cd are hardcore fans, so adding some other great favorites such as ""My World"", ""Lady Red Light"", and ""Mean Mistreater"" would have really made this perfect. Not to mention, there are no tunes from 1993's 'Sail Away'. Other then that, the vibe, quality of the recording, and the musicianship are stellar!"
3,A best-seller but not a great performance,"I suppose I should begrudge this widely admired CD a fourth star. It appeared at the height of the media's enthusiasm for Slatkin as ""the next great American condcutor"" during the mid-Eighties. In fact, Slatkin's career was at its zenith already, and so was his talent. Here, in music all but patented and copyrighted by Leonard Bernstein, Slatkin turns whiskey to water. His approach is cautious by Bernstein's zesty standards, his dance rhythms achingly square. (If you want the complete Billy the Kid from a ballet master, try the 1953 mono recording under Joseph Levine, also on EMI.)For some reason The Gramophone latched on to this CD as a first choice. If they won't tell us about Copland, I promise not to tell them about Elgar."
5,Chronic Jointz Rocks,"Two great things about this CD. First, every track is better than the one before it. Second, I no longer have to sit there putting all of my CDs back into the cases, its all right there. This has immediately moved to the first position on my CD player, and I'm pretty sure it will stay there for a while."
4,poorly published,"The content of the book is just terrific. See other reviews.I just wanted to let folks know that for their $19.95, they are getting a very cheaply made book. The cover is quite thin, but even worse, the book is printed on awful, pulpy paper--worse than most romance/mystery novels.I'm sure that it will pass out of its concrescence sooner than most books . . . ."
2,Disappointing,"I was hoping this book would help prepare me as we wait to adopt a 2.5-3 year old child. Unfortunately, the book is really geared towards first time parents and since this will be our 4th child, there was very little in the book that I found at all helpful."
1,Waste of money,Like listening to a neighbor spout off her opinions and reactions to her own personal experience. Advice amounted to pointing out the obvious.
4,Handy To Have - Recommended,"These Neiko Tools ""315 piece Roll Pin Assortment"" comes with a convenient plastic storage case and holds 30 common roll pin sizes. We are in the process of opening a small gun shop and already do a fair amount of gunsmithing that requires the use of roll pins, so wanted to have a selection of these on-hand.Most of the pins are longer than we need and have to be cut down, but that is not really an issue for us. We use the smaller roll pins often but I think the larger sizes are going to sit around awhile.This is a decent quality set and reasonable value.Recommended!CFH"
2,roll pins,box came broke and all pis in every part. too many big pins. used the smaller ones but the bigger ones are mostly useless
2,ok,Should have less large pins and more smaller pins. I have already used the pins that I needed and have no more uses for the product product
4,"Sequel is not equal, but still a great piece of literature","Faulkner's literary reputation and legacy was cemented by the time this sequeal to The Hamlet appeared. He had also written all of his important works and was loosing his ""touch"", writing sequels to his more famous works and light weight nostalgic pieces (i.e. The Reivers). All in all this is still an important examination of the south, filled with the humor and horror that was Faulkner's trademark. Anyone interested in his body of work will have to read it at least once."
4,"Would LOVE to have this, but.........","Pricey! This would be a fantastic addition to my Michael Collection, but it costs more than my Official Michael Jackson OPUS! I hope to eventually purchase it but just not right now."
2,Bad design,"I'll admit, this is a tough phone to design a case for, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. That said, I can't count the number of times my phone has dropped to the floor because the snap on the antenna strap has come undone. Since the mount for the belt clip is attached below the phone's center of gravity, It constantly rotates upside down which contributes to this problem. Add the fact that it really doesn't protect the phone to start with and you are better off keeping your phone in your pocket with your keys and change. That way, you'll at least always know where it is!"
3,cheap but doesn't provide much protection,"To be sure, this case is functional and inexpensive. However, it lacks any protection for the flip cover, which becomes easily scratched / dented whenever it gets bumped. If I had it to do over, I might pay a bit more and receive that much more protection."
2,Disappointed,"I like the color (hibiscus), but... Buttons are so loosely attached to the shirt that they fell off on the very first day of wearing!"
3,"wonderful show, subpar blu ray","Similar to another review posted here, I adore this show. Its fun, quirky, creative and different, a great contrast to the usual painfully artificial shows on mainstream tv. While the other review provides a great overview of the show's merits, my review focuses on the medium choice - my recommendation is to simply buy the standard definition version. I'll grant that this show is not a Hollywood production with those kind of budgets, so I'm thankful for what I get. That said, it would appear almost no work went into engineering the content for blu ray. Unfortunately, the image feels like a photo file unedited from a low quality camera - exposure is off, color saturation is weak, and overall contrast is lacking. Sound is the same, not well engineered and peaky and flat. Again, I adore this show, and you should run, not walk, to own it. Just save yourself the funds and stick with the standard definition (and this is coming from a blu ray addict)."
4,Funny Show,"Holliston is a great show for fans of sitcoms and horror movies alike. There are so many references to horror movies in each episode, so if you are a die-hard horror fan you will relate to the characters. For me, the funniest part of the show is Dee Snider. Every time he is on screen, the show reaches infinite levels of hilarity. Tony Todd guest stars in an episode, playing a parody of himself. It is hilarious, and shows a different side of himself that we've never seen before. Tony Todd is famous for playing creepy roles like Candyman, and here he plays against type and shows his comedic side. There are also guest starring roles by John Landis, Danielle Harris, Kane Hodder, Seth Green, and Ray Wise in Season 1. The show isn't perfect as it does get repetitive at times, and I would have liked for there to have been more than six episodes. Still, a very good show!"
5,AWESOME!,GREAT! One of the best tv shows out there. If you don't like I don't know what's wrong with you.
2,I wanted to like it so bad...,One question encapsualtes my extreme dissapointment with this series. What is with the laugh track? - OMG - it basically ruins every scene. 'Ooooooo' 'ahhhhhh' 'woop' - it sucks the life out of every line.What were they thinking.This just further adds to my disgust about Todd and the Book of Pure Evil being cancelled. Somewhere someone is paying for this drivel to be made? - money that could be spent on Season 3 of Todd? Oh the humanity!
5,Book helps men and women if either is open to it,"Read this book cover to cover over time as Michael makes you think. It is a book about principles that people should seriously consider before getting married to ensure success in the marriage. It really is applicable to both men and women as either can be the offender in a relationship, despite the stats saying men offend greater than women. There is much to this topic that is not violence related that this book helps one understand greatly. If more people read this book, more people would seriously consider better communication in a relationship to solve problems proactively not reactively after it is too late."
2,It's ok,"The book is more towards a home for men who batter. I have not have time to read it, but it wasn't what I expected to be. I would have like more research on the topic."
2,Dated and rhetorical,"A very outdated book in light of the recent research showing that women are just as likely as men to initiate a violent confrontation with an intimate partner. The book takes the VAWA approach in condemning men whilst never touching on the accountabilities of women as the culprits of a majority of child abuse.Whilst we continue to target men as evil and women as saints we run the risk of ignoring many victims, which is exactly what VAWA has done. The policy of assuming all men and only men are the culprits will shift much needed funds and attention from other victims who suffer just as much.This book needs to be accompanied with one targeting women and the domestic violence they are accountable for. Perhaps Andrea Yates would not be famous if society took a 'Stop all abuse by everyone' approach.2 stars for the effort, but this is a step in the wrong direction for both equality and helping everyone who suffers from abuse."
1,Knock off?,"Didn't smell anything like the original Aqua di Parma I'd had for years. Was so strong and offensive, I threw it out."
3,Ordered wrong product !!!!,The CD compilation was good by not by original artists.....I gave CD to a young friend of family since I am a collector of original songs....Also songs are a medley--not the entire song.....
5,Go get this CD if you don't already have it!,"This CD is by far one of my favorites. But sadly, the only publicity it ever got was for Pokemon. The lyrics to their songs are something that every girl can relate to. My favorite songs on the CD are "" The Day You Went Away, Girl In Your Dreams, Our song, and Give a Little Love."" You won't complete your collection without this album. I can't wait until the next one comes out!"
5,Awesome GIRLS!,"Hi everyone! This CD is excellent, and its even better meeting them in person. I met M2M, and they are 2 of the most beautiful girls I have ever met in my life. They play their own instruments, and write excellent songs, very talented, a must have I love the 2 girls."
4,TALENT!,"The girls of m2m really have got some heavy talent. Their high voices have been criticized as sounding like chipmunks, but what I hear is beautiful. Stand-outs include ""Day You Went Away,"" ""Don't Say You Love Me,"" and ""Everything You Do."" Great pop album, and hopefully these girls will get some recognition some day!"
3,Ehm.......,"Girls, you have really naturally beautiful voices! Don't ruin them with this mixing-stuff! Those squeeky voices are just too much in the end. As for the songs, it's a big pluss that most of them - including the music - was written by them, and Girl in your dreams is so true.... :) But many of the other ones don't ""speak"" to me if you know what I mean. (I it wasen't for that they wrote everything themselves and I've seen them live on TV, I'd give this a two or three - stars.)"
1,don't waste your money,"Ok these girls sound like the chipmunks. Seriously. Even my friends think so. This album truly defines the reason that people think pop is [bad]. Don't buy it, you'll just be wasting your money."
5,Wow!,"This cd is especially cool because it is by two girls only, with not that much help, it really is a great cd with great singers. I think the best song is ""Mirror Mirror."" It is just fun! If you don't have this cd it's a great one to get, I definitly recomend it."
5,great songs!!,"Marit(the blonde)and Marion(the brunette) is a very good songwriter.their songs is very easy to relate and i love it since the first time i listened to it.I have their second album too,it is The Big Room and it is more POWER!!!they write all the songs themselves..."
5,M2M Shades of Purple Special Edition Rocks,"It's the perfect seletion of songs for a girl to listen to. My cousin and I listen to it all the time! We know all the words. Don't Say You Love Me,Mirror Mirror,The Day You Went Away,Pretty Boy and,Give A Little Love are the best songs! If you don't have this CD yet buy it. It's kind of hard to find in my opinion and expensive but once you have it you regret it."
4,"Real, live talent. Something pop music desperatley needs.","M2M bring something different to the table on their debut, Shades of Purple. In addition to being attractive and likeable (the two important ingredients for success in today's pop world), they also 'GASP' play their own instruments (One plays guitar, the other plays piano and occasional a precussionary instrument or two) and they play them WELL. They also 'Double GASP' write almost all of their music themselves, instead of relying on a team of pop craftsmen, and even produce a good deal. It's like two Debbie Gibsons with more talent.These girls are refreshing in the face of all the contrived pop in the world today. It's nice to hear young girls not going for sex appeal and instead concentrating on their lyrics and their music to catch fans. Not quite as cheesy as Hanson, either, who are also showing signs of life with their sophomore effort, 'This Time Around'. M2M may be around for awhile. Real musicians usually are."
5,Anonymous,"definitely the best and very worth the money, i love every single song on this cd, it was great. the sad part is M2M is split up now, hopefully they will change their mind sigh.."
5,Best pick!!!,"M2M is a type of music,they can sing do that,or happens somebody else.""Don't Say You Love Me"" has good lyrics,catchy,but amazing.If you like pick at my car,go get it now at Amazon.com!Only M2M albums that i like to do something else.ESPIE"
4,M2M - the beggining,A very solid first album for these young and cute girls from Norway. They have alot of talent and can go a long way if they can get the global recognition they diserve. It is also great that so many songs from the album were made into video clips:Don't say you love me - I watchewd it like 20 times a weekMirror Mirror - nice one againEverything you do - cool how they changed it from the originalGirl in your dreamsPretty BoyThe day you went awaySix clips from one album is an accomplishment for any band.The thing that lets them done is to many ballads - nice but to many and the inexperience.Good buy for the pop fan.
2,A little redundant,"While there are some good songs on this album (Don't say you love me, Our song, Girl in your dreams), they wear out quickly unless your really into teenie-bopper pop music, or your a 13 year old girl. Mostly all the songs just seem like variations of the same theme. The only thing that about m2m that caught my attention is Don't say you love me from the pokemon soudtrack (and i dont even like pokemon). From what i've heard, their next album is just going to be more of the same."
4,sweet,"well, i have only heard mirror, mirror and don't say you love me off this cd, but i think that this duo has a sweet, fresh sound i would buy this cd"
3,Kinda disappointed...,"I hate to say this, but I only found four or five interesting songs on this album... I thought they'd be a blast after hearing their single ""Don't Say You Love Me"". I think Lene Marlin is better than this group (eek!)."
2,"If I could go back, I would not buy it.","Their voices are just a little too sweet for me- nothing like what I heard on the Disney concert. The songs are nice and catchy, but if you're expecting the beautiful and unique voices you heard on the Disney concert, with that unique blend of harshness and sweetness that only the greatest female singers can achieve... And if, like me, you thought it was too good to be true that 2 15 year old girls can achieve this... it is."
2,Somes are good! but..M2M makes me be sick of Teen pop!,"Well. Somes are good.for example, Everything you do, The day you went away..But Each of Songs are all the same!Just says Love and love and love and love and love...pretty pretty pretty boy boy boy boy....Yuck! Please M2M, don't be such a foolish duo!I wish M2M to be better in sophomore album..."
3,"Not my ""Cup of tea""","I bought these as a backup pair of keeper shorts and was not impressed. Basically standard soccer shorts with a little padding on the sides. OK for someone starting out in goal, but money would be better spent on a compression style short."
3,USFL Remembered,PRO FOOTBALL FUNNIES is an outakes and bloopers reel that features USFL (1983-1985) footage. Aside from the humor value of watching the rain come down in Noah/flood proportions in Jacksonville or Denver Gold Coach Craig Morton having fits with his headset....it is classic USFL!
4,"Halcyon Days, whereever you are, take a bow. And good review from my buddy Ken Saroka as well!","Ken just got married, so I'll embarasshim a bit here too. Great video compila-tion of the top Pro Football League ofthe '80's (besides of course the CFL!),the United States Football League, who'slast player, Doug Flutie just retired, anamazing 20-yrs., after the League wentunder. Great tape! I still buy many copieswhen I find them in thrift shops and usedvideo / DVD places. Pick Up On It, USFL fans!"
3,Harley ID Pet Tag,The tag is very nice but my dog chewed right thru the plastic liner. I tried spraying it with Bitter Apple but he still chewed it.
2,Dated and linear,Dated and linear but with a good McGuffin. I had to finish it but after it went straight in the bin. I couldn't think of anyone else who might want to read it
3,Undercover in British racing,"An Australian horse breeder goes undercover to find the cause of some unexplained race finishes.The usual Dick Francis twists and turns, some of which stretch the imagination a little.Also the usual good writing and characters we have come to expect from Dick Francis."
3,"A good book, with some fast action and a dash of romance","i like the idea of a stable owner becoming a hired hand, and finding out its not much fun. and imagine how it feels to have the boss's daugthter accuse you, while the other boss's daughter says you didn't do it? and falling in love with the second daughter while someone is trying to kill you both, no to mention throwing every race on the card . . ."
3,Anti-Gentilism - an even longer hatred..,".. I haven't read this book (3 stars is the mid-point, not intended to mean anything), but would point out that, following this book, Lady Jane Birdwood in Britain published 'The Longest Hatred - Anti-Gentilism' as a booklet, which had a chequered history of prosecutions and harrassment. I assume the title was a riposte to Wistrich's book. Probably it's available on line with a bit of Googling."
4,Up-front experience of war and how it effects real people.,"Elma Softic has allowed us to read her personal diary and correspondance to family members about how the war in Sarajevo effected her family, friends, neighbors, and herself personally. Sometimes graphic, always honest, and frequently emotionally charged. Helped me prepare for what I was about to see when I travelled to Sarajevo recently, and how to best help the people left behind."
5,Good Book for Rice Lovers,"I bought this book twice, actually. Once for me and then later for my cousin. It's full of recipes for things to go on your favorite rice."
3,Just Ok - Recipes didn't pan out.,"The Good:- Recipes in this book are quick as advertised.- One pot wonder heavenThe Bad:-Recipes are just ok.Details:So far I've tried two recipes, and I'm not impressed. They weren't bad, but they weren't amazing.When I try a new cookbook, I try to determine if I should if it's worth my time. I start with the recipes with subtle ingredients such as scallops, calamari, or any kind of white fish. The scallops in sherry-garlic sauce was just good to pretty good, but the calamari puttanesca was barely acceptable.After two recipes, I stopped there. I wasn't floored by either of them. I'm going to shelve this one, or sell it used."
2,OK,"This cook book has great photos for every recipe and a good variety of foods. However, the emphasis is NOT on rice, but on different main entrees. Each recipe has suggestions for the rice to serve with the entree, but does not give detailed cooking directions for the rice. A disappointment."
1,save your money,I could not believe how bad this dvd was.... The video was probably filmed 20 years ago... The exercises were nothing special and there is basically just one main exercise. Save your money and buy something else
3,Kind of boring,"Hopefully I am leaving this review for the correct DVD. I get them confused. This note is in regards to the DVD where you hold your hand limp in front of your face for 45 minutes. (Not the DVD where you lay on your back and reach your arm up while moving your legs.)I don't know what this helps--holding you hand in front of your face. The spine stretching and twisting made sense, and my spine did become more limber as the class moved forward. Otherwise, that whole hand thing and moving your eyes back and forth seemed kind of pointless to me.I like the DVD from this couple directed by Laura Paris in which you lay on your back and reach your arm above your head much better."
2,This lens has a lot to offer.,"Don't overlook this lens. It does not have the longest zoom range available. But the F2.8 maximum aperature, the very serviceable 28-105mm range, the weight and size, the high quality of material and optics, and the price make this a pleasure to use and carry. If you want to carry only one lens, you need a longer range than this one has. But if you are going to carry two or more lenses, this one deserves to be in your bag."
4,Space: 1999 finally gets some respect,"I always considered the '70s sci-fi show ""Space: 1999"" something of a guilty pleasure. Muir's book, however, shows there was more substance to the ill-fated series than even I thought. My only reservation about the book is that Muir doesn't know nearly as much about other SF series as he does about ""Space: 1999."" Some of his comments about ""Babylon 5,"" for instance, fall well off the mark. (Muir contrasts the two, while I think they share some similarly Lovecraftian undercurrents.)"
1,ugliest dolls I have ever seen,"Bought these dolls for my niece to play with in her dollhouse. They were the ugliest dolls i have ever seen, The clothes on them were junk."
3,Melissa & Doug family,I was disappointed with this family. They are not flexible enough to sit in chairs or anything. I should have kept with the Fisher Price loving family.
4,great dolls,the dolls are great. The only thing that frustrates my daughter is that the do not stand and they are difficult to bend. It's so hard to find a larger sized doll for a doll house so we're glad we at least found some for hers.
4,doll house family,The doll house family is somewhat flexible. All the joints in the body do not move.Some of the clothing -jackets - can be removed.It is wonderful that the family can be ordered in various ethnic origins.
2,Too small,"We bought this to go with a large dollhouse. The faces are not very friendly. They are small. My daughter has not even wanted to play with them since ""santa"" brought them on Christmas."
3,do not reccomend for dollhouse,"pretty disappointed in these and would not reccomend to go with a dollhouse.my daughter loves to role play with this family but I think she would do that with ANY doll family.These figures are VERY hard to stand up, and I have a lot of difficulty getting them to bend. I ended up buying her a different family for her dollhouse because I knew these would cause a lot of frusteration.Now with that said it is a nice looking family with realistic features and the hair is soft."
4,"Leaves A Little To Be Desired, Considering Quality of Other Products","These dolls rank the least of the accessories for the Melissa & Doug Victorian Dollhouse. All of the other accessories are very nice, high quality dollhouse items. Not your typical Toys R Us, Target or Wal-Mart toys. Our 10-Year-Old daughter loves her Melissa & Doug Victorian Dollhouse and all of the accessories that we purchased to go with it. However, the dolls leave a little to be desired. As one reviewer wrote, the dolls are not even victorian! You've got to have dolls, not sure of a better option."
4,Nice quality dolls,These are smaller dolls that work well with a 2'x 2' type open walled doll house. Do note that these dolls don't really bend or conform to different shapes. We purchased because they are dressed with dignity and not as white trash! Enjoy.
3,Too big for the dollhouse and not poseable.,"I am deeply disappointed in this family. 1) The Baby is disproportionate to the parents, 2) they do not bend easily, 3) they can't sit down on the dollhouse furniture, 4) Their clothing is not removable and therefore cannot be changed, 5) they are unable to hold the baby, and 6) they are too big for my dollhouse (a six room victorian)."
2,Cheap little dolls,"I was really disappointed with these dolls. I ordered them to go with the Kidcraft Savannah Dollhouse. First off, they were smaller than the description. They were so cheap - the material they are made out of reminded me of the Gumby toys, only they're not as easily bendable. It's impossible for my 4 year-old to pose them for her dollhouse. Although she likes them, I wish I had purchased Barbies instead."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought these dolls to go with the KidKraft Georgia Peach Dollhouse and was very disappointed in everything about them. They look cheap, they don't move, their clothing is glued on, and their hair (after a couple of weeks of play) is a huge rats nest. I am with most of the other reviews in that I would have just ordered Barbie's instead had I known that these dolls were such a rip off. I can't even believe that they are selling them like this.My daughter still plays with them, but gets annoyed and asks for help every time she tries to sit one down at the table or on the couch.I would recommend NOT to buy these and find something else!"
2,Leaves a lot to be desired,"I bought these dolls despite the negative reviews. It is so difficult to find dollhouse dolls (we have the KidKraft Savannah dollhouse). I knew there'd be a good chance I'd be out searching for dolls AGAIN, and I am. One of the earlier reviewers compare the dolls to Pokey & Gumbie. That is a very accurate comparison. That is my biggest complaint -- not very bendable. I also want to warn buyers that these dolls are quite small. If you have a dollhouse that will fit Barbie-sized dolls, you will be disappointed with these.I guess I'll be visiting Mattel's website in an effort to find my daughter a couple Barbies who are conveying a positive message... don't get me started!!"
3,doll family,"This is cute enough, but there is nothing Victorian, the family is wearing modern clothes. It also is next to impossible to make them sit on the Melissa & Doug furniture we bought for the dollhouse. Also, there should be a little boy offered, not just two girls."
3,Surprised,"I purchased these dolls for my daughter (age 7) to use with her new dollhouse. These dolls were suggested with the Annabell Dollhouse so I thought they would be perfect for it. Surprisingly though, they are very small, they do not bend at the knee, their clothes are too big and they are too little for such a large dollhouse. I would suggest them for a much smaller house and only if you can't find dolls that bend better or have clothes that you can change out."
3,perfect for tall dollhouses but they still won't sit well,These dolls are a good buy for tall dollhouses and they are pretty flexible but it's still difficult to get them to sit on a chair.
1,very disappointing xmas.,"daughters were hysterical on xmas. Got these for their doll house. Does not look like the picture. Their clothes are about 3x bigger than the dolls in real life. Also, they are not like regular doll house dolls. They are stiff, have NO joints.......they are softer plastic though so u can kinda try to ""pose"" them. they slowly go back to their normal pose though within minutes. very hard to pose, does not stand either, and parents cant hold baby like pictured! VERYYYYYYY upset."
4,Doll house family,"The family I purchased for my grand daughter's doll house are very nice. I wish there were more families, or additional children to buy to go along with them. Overall, very pleased with the doll house as well."
3,Melissa & Doug Dollhouse family,"I bought this for our grandaughter. I was impressed by the company and reviews; however, when I received this item I have to say I was a little taken-back at how cheap they look. On the upside, they look hand-made. LOLTime will tell how durable they are."
4,Adorable Dolls!,"My 3yr old daughter does like these dolls, even though the flexibility of the dolls, is not great for real play! They are very adorble and look great, but we really needed something than can handle real play! My daughter has the Playwonder Playhouse and these were also very small for it, but mostly, we wanted dolls to be more flexible. We ened up purchasing after they finally came out with really nice one's, the Playwonder doll family (very flexible for kids play!)."
5,Great dolls,I really like this doll set. I like how their faces and bodies look real. My daughter really enjoys playing with them. Their legs bend easily so she can manipulate them to sit down. I would recommend this product to a friend.
4,Doll family,"I bought this doll family for my 9 year old daughter who loves to play house with Barbie and Ken. The appeal here was that they came as a ""family"". This is hard to find. The mother and older daughter have nice hair to play with but the one drawback my daughter found was that she can't change their clothes. For some reason, part of their clothing is glued on. Otherwise, she loves them."
5,Melissa & Doug Victorian Doll Family,Great for a doll house or imaginative play even without a house. Good quality.
2,"Cute, but not high quality...","I generally love Melissa & Doug toys, and this set of little dolls looked so beautiful I just had to splurge for my youngest daughter. They are beautiful, but I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the clothes. The seams are poorly sewn and if you want to take them off and on more than once or twice (with extreme care) they begin to fall apart. The pants don't stay up to begin with, the little jackets don't even have one tiny snap to keep them on, and they have an unfinished appearance in general. It's too bad, because they appear to be so nice."
3,Like it but wish the dolls were flexible,These dolls are well made and fit well within any dollhouse. I only wish these dolls were flexible. Their legs don't move so they can't sit.
3,"Cute, but not ""Victorian""","I'm not sure why these are described as part of a ""victorian"" family, since their clothing is most definitely NOT victorian. Mom with knee-length a-line skirt? Girl with pants?!! Bad on historical accuracy, though I have no problem with the dolls otherwise."
2,Victorian?,"This item is not labled correctly. Go by the picture. If you want Victorian clothes, pick something else.The dolls themselves are good. They are bendable. For my purpose, they are fine. I am using the entire family to help with the size and scale of other minitures. Nice for the price."
3,not so pleased,"Fit was not appropriate for intended person. However, was able to give to someone with larger cup size than stated on order and tag. I ordered 40b and it fit 40d."
3,Feels good for a little while...,"This bra is okay. I bought three different bras, all the same size but different types, and this one fit the worst. It feels good for awhile, but then it starts to pinch and feel confining. It does provide good support, and it looks good under my clothes. I'll keep wearing it, but I won't buy this one again."
3,mediocre,"This bra is just okay for the price. Brown color is good, but the cups are very stiff and unnatural and have a thick feel to them. Don't think I would buy again."
1,Received Used Bra,We ordered for 2. One of them was a used one. Smelt some strong odor. Hence we returned back to Amazon. Amazon processed the return and we got our money back without any issues. This type of Bra is very good.
3,Hardly a double support bra,"This bra is O.K ... it's a good lift but not much in terms of support, moreover i would never call it a ""double support bra"" because it's not ... don't get me wrong it's not a bad bra it's just not enough for me (i am a C cup)it arrived fast ... in a plastic bag (not package) ... and it was true to size"
2,Not a Great Bra,These are for torpedo boobs! Not at all as shown in the photograph! Did not like it at all and returned it immediately!
2,Didn't like this one --support and fit not good,"Since I have had some success with Bali lingeries, I decided to give this style a try. I am full figured. I didn't like this one at all because it didn't seem to have a good fit. A good fitting bra should fit flush against your breastbone, but this one didn't do that, perhaps because it is softcup (a lingerie fitter did tell me once that full figures need the shaping of underwire; perhaps that explains it). This bra doesn't support, but rather just kind of squishes you into a unflattering and uncomfortable look which has no lift or definition at all. And I doubt it would be good even as a sleep bra or ""home"" bra either. I don't think it is right for full figured types, but since bras are such a personal garment it's possible others may feel differently."
5,Comfortable,"It has been a challenge finding bras without bones, smaller cups and comfortable. Had one of these, finally stopped looking and bought 3 more on line. Am a 42c and most of it in my back. These are so comfortable that I have fallen asleep in them and not compelled to tear them off as soon as I get home!"
5,Support yet comfortable,"I wear a 44D and felt I was always sagging by the end of the day. The stretch straps, which I thought I needed for comfort, were actually not giving me the lift I needed. This bra has great support and is very comfortable. I put my Playtex bras away and wear only this brand and style."
2,not impressed,No real support for big chested girls.Was good for a week and then it was useless.Was much more impressed with a JMS bra that I got later.
3,Will use as a lounging bra,"In general, I don't feel like this bra provides me with enough support and separation for my D cup figure. Not exactly what I expected given it's name, ""Double Support"". I prefer a more lifted look and feel under my clothing when I am out in public than I get from this bra. Being wire-free, the bra is very comfortable and it works fine for me when I am just lounging around the house, which is why I am keeping it. It probably would be better suited to someone with a smaller cup size."
4,Good Bra,"I have been wearing this bra for years. I find it comfortable. It support well, not as good as a wireless but easier to wear all day."
5,Great product!,This is a wonderful bra for women with full breasts that don't like underwire bras. It is very well made.
3,Shape was Wrong,"I didn't try it on long enough to tell you about how well it may or may not support you. As soon as I opened the package, I saw that its shape was odd. The cups are cloth and already likely to give a cone-type shape. On top of this, the cloth was loose and the border was fitting making it impossible to fix the shape or fit of the cloth part of the cups.It was just very odd, even under a tight, shelved undershirt. Also, the separation was a bit extreme for me. I don't want two triangles poking out, I want them to be separate but complementary."
3,Pretty good bra for soft cup,I am a Bali bra fan from way back. Always wear underwire though. I tried this bra on a whim and find that it's not bad. It offers support if you tighten the straps more than you normally would with underwire. Otherwise the girls tend to adhere to gravity. The price is right and I would recommend as a one time try.
2,"Just OK nothing great, not that comfortable","Was ok for the cost, but did not support well in cups. And was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake [inside under band]"
4,Comfort,"I wore them for years and could not find them in the stores. Also, the price was much better than in the stores."
5,Just what I was looking for,Very happy that I found this bra. I've been searching the stores and was unable to find it.No problem getting my size and had it in a few days.
3,Doesn't fit me that well,"I prefer bras without underwires. I don't really need that much support since I am only a 38B. This is an attractive bra, and it is comfortable. However, it doesn't fit me well, unlike other Bali bras. There seems to be too much fabric in the top of the cup, so it is sort of puckery."
2,Ouch uncumfortable,This is very irritating to wear. Feels tight yet it is the same size as the rest of my other bra's and they fit fine. I will not get bra'a from amazon again.
4,Decent support without underwire,"I am used to wearing an underwire bra but decided to try this out. It's comfortable for me (a 34DD) without digging into my ribcage for traction. It does have a bit of ""tube"" concerns. If you are not wearing it with a t-shirt or close fitting sweater, it is terrific. Comfortable, lightweight and easy to hook makes a great choice for the full chested woman."
2,Very Uncomfortable,"The title says it all. This bra is not comfortable. Also, the cup does not fit properly. I put it in the charity box after one wearing."
1,Bad Bra!!! Do Not Purchase if your Big Breasted.,Only reason i even gave this item an 1 star was because the order arrived before due date. This bra is cheap and horrible! It does not support anything. Not to mention the bra makes your breast look pointy. it's shaped funny. i am n the process of returning this item a.s.a.p! (and i really hate returning things)
4,"Great casual bra, maybe not for work.","This fits great and feels great, has a wide band to hold the back down even if you have a heavy load. The cups are not that 'formed' so I won't wear this under clingy sweaters. So it is perfect for what I wanted, but maybe not for work or clingy tops!"
2,runs a lot bigger (higher) than it use to,"I've bought this same style for years at the store and online and it seems the sizing must have changed. This one is much, much higher than it normally is, the cup seems bigger too. So, I guess I'll just wear it under certain shirts that are cut high. But I will have to go back to the stores to buy any more in the future."
3,So-So,"The bra is okay. It fits me okay. I'm just not crazy about it. For me, not having stretch straps is a big deal (and I should have noticed this before buying it). But even if it did, I don't think I'd be crazy about it. The cups are sort of polyester-ish in a bad way ... they feel weird to me. So I give it a so-so."
5,Clear water i can see my fish again.,"Length:: 0:21 MinsHere is my pond just put in new liner this year the filter you see i bought a coupleyears ago, and still keeping water clean."
3,Price Increase,"Great product and good price (when I bought it 2 weeks ago). Since then the price has almost doubled, what gives. At this new price, I guess I will shop somewhere else."
2,Thank you Anne Rice,"Dear AnnI read the reviews of you latest book and can't wait to read it. I love the character Lestat. My nephew Michael stole your works from me, because he doesn't think I should be following such things being a Christian. God only knows what he did with them, may he be judge. Again thank you for your very talented work. All the best to you. Peace and Love"
3,not as good,"Blackwood Farm was excellent and i was very excited about blood canticle. Unfortunately it wasnt one of Anne Rice's best. Read it, but dont expect much. And Mona, what an irritating character."
3,Little bit of both ...,"The story content of this book was very interesting to me. I wished that maybe there was some more debt into the Taltos but alas, I have lots of wishes.With this being the last book in the Chronicles and especially from Lestat's eye, it left me with NO closure. I was impressed that for once she didn't have Lestat turn someone, but to just end it and leave the world wondering what happenes is very frustrating to me. With this being the last book in the series, I personally was looking for some closure for the characters. Or should I say more closure. Even if it is just an Epilogue to sum it all up.I do not think of this book as a bad book. I enjoyed reading it. I can not say that it was bad. When the plot was in focus I was enthralled!"
5,Excellent book!,"Great book. As the series goes on, Anne Rice really puts out some winners and by this point you are so into all of the charachters that you can't get enough."
3,Good reading,"I think the book was good, and I would also like to add another book that I found excellent, this author is up and coming and has written a great book...its called: SEASON OF THE DEAD.(...)Its worth the time and the money to experience this book and All it has to offer.....Check it Out......."
2,I Hope This Really Wasn't The End,"As a long time fan of The Vampire Chronicles, I can't help but hope this book was not the last about all the characters we have all come to care about. While it was clever to pull the two sagas (the vampires and the Mayfairs) into one story, this book really concluded nothing, and very little actually happened in this novel. The story is rather weak and does not give us a final wrap up on Louis or Armand or Marius or David, not even on Lestat really. The end of the book leaves my hopes up for more to come and maybe a concluding novel that will do the series justice. It's worth reading if only just to visit briefly with the characters and world readers have come to know. Not Anne's best work - but we should all give the lady a break. I think (and hope) there will be more to come."
1,Terrible book,"Anne should have taken some time off to grieve, and not to write this book. It is the worst of them all. I skipped entire chapters that were poorly written. My thirteen year old nephew speaks like Lestat. What a disappointment. Get it out of the library, so you don't have to pay for it, if you don't believe me. DON""T BUY THIS BOOK>>>>"
3,Finale to a series,"I found this book to be so-so. I have spent the last year reading the 10 books in the vampire series and 3 books in the Mayfair Witches series. I am glad it is over. The books seem to get more and more boring as they go along. Some of the books seem to be nothing more than a rehash of previous books. If I were recommending to a friend, I would say to quite reading after Memnoch the Devil, and The witching hour is the only worthwhile Mayfair book. It seems the author got a successful series started, then cashed in by spitting out several mediocre books without much effort."
2,definitely a slip,"I've been reading Anne Rice's books for well over 10 years now, and I have to say I've never been truly disappointed until Blood Canticle. Blackwood Farm was okay, especially when compared to the earlier Vampire Chronicles and the stories of the Mayfair Witches, but Blood Canticle was a huge let down. The diatribe on ""getting"" Memnoch was definitely insulting to long-time fans. Maybe it's time for Rice to leave the vampires and witches behind and start with some new ""blood""."
3,Tall Toes and Smoky-smoky,"I am a big fan of Anne Rice, have read all her books, blah blah blah. The bottom line is Anne Rice is ending her Chronicles with this? At least that's what I heard. I tolerated the disorganization and rambling about the Pope etc. because I was hoping for a great story. It never happens. The resolution is too rapid and clean. The characters, like others have pointed out, aren't consistent with previous books, even Lestat. I still love Anne Rice, would recommend this to fans, and would read anything she wrote."
1,So Bad !!!!!!,"This is not only her worst effort , it's one of the most Dull,Laughable ,and Unreadable books EVER !!! Oh yeah none of the other vamps are here in case you were wondering, BTW I was a hugh Anne Rice fan but it's obvious she's lost her stride !"
2,Disappointing,"I loved Blackwood Farm, but having now read the sequel, Blood Canticle, I find it disappointing. The story is loose, slow, unfocused. It feels like Rice has tried to tie up loose ends without being able to create a coherent story. At times, she seems to please herself with rantings that give the novel little direction. Read it if you must, but don't expect too much of this one."
2,If you can't stand the heat...,"This book is really not good work compared to Ms Rice's earliest works, although I still think the Witching Hour is the finest book that she has written. This book has the thinly etched sense that makes me feel as if I have already read it.I don't see any point in being nasty or personal, that's just my take. These are reader opinions, not professional reviewers, but we do buy (and buy and buy) her books. If she can't take the heat she should stay out of the Literary Amazon Kitchen."
2,Blood Canticle,"I have read all of ann rice's books and have debated of them all at some point in time. though this book is one of her worst ones yet, I see no reason to slam her for it. In case you people don't keep up with the news, she's retiring the publisher's needed her to write an ending for her chronicles. She had nothing left to give, but hell at least she tried. I don't see how anyone can complain. She wrote for herself not the public so get over her book being crap."
1,"Very,Very disappointed","I read all of the reviews for this book and I thought it can't be that bad. From the 3rd chapter I thought to myself who is this new whinny,weak Lestat? The story line was weak and my goodness Quin is such a wimp! What a useless side kick! Also what was up with Lestat's lingo??? Yo Bro? I have so many more things to add but I'm sure it will just be the same thing has everyone else's. So, I will just say this for shame anne, for shame you could have done a lot better then this!"
2,A disappointing finish,"Spending years loving Rice's work, I was eager to read what is to be the conclusion of the vampire chronicles. The matter-of-fact off-the-cuff manner of writing disturbed me - unlike the manner of speech we are accustomed to from Lestat. The tiresome Shakesperean quotes from Mona & Quinn. Tired of Mona's portrayal of herself as Ophelia already! Enough! So much about Saints and description of the clothes Mona takes from Aunt Queen's closet! Trivial dribble. So little substance. Far too much time wasted on the lackluster story of the Taltos. The rather odd and inexplicable appearance of Oncle Julien & Stella. This feels like a half-hearted effort to appease fans looking for another Lestat story and close off the vampire series. It is evident her mind was not wholly focused on this with the understandable personal matters she faced at the time she penned this work. It is a sad farewell to the Vampires so many have grown to love. All the best to Ms. Rice in her new endeavours."
1,MY EYES!! THEY BURN!,"First off, Lestat wants to be a wholesome saint....that will tell you something about this book. Anne Rice turned Lestat from our loving Brat Prince into....i don't even know what! Not to mention that there is way to much stuff about Taltos and Lasher. The entire book is centered around the now, meek Quinn and the bratty little fledgling Mona. No other characters are even in the book from the Chronicles besides Lestat and Quinn. And for the last of the books, shouldn't they be included. Louis is reffered to once, and not even by Lestat, and Maharet sends Lestat a letter. Come on!! The book is littered with Christian refrences that just ruin it. The book is slow and again, way too much about Taltos and Mona. I WANTED LOUIS, ARMAND, AND MARIUS AT THE LEAST. It was very dissapointing, and the only reason i read the whole thing through was in hopes that another Vampire would be included. Sigh. I could have written a better finale! Sigh. Oh Brat Prince, what a way to go!"
1,SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO LESTAT!,"Lestat advises us to skip chapter one if we are unhappy in our reading. Should have listened, skipped that chapter and all others.This ends my love affair with the Vampire Chronicles, which honestly provided me with great pleasure over the years. Seems to me the Publisher should have had some sense of decency. There is no mistaking this book for anything other that a childish,amateurish attemmpt to capitalize on a ""name"" author.Someone inform the publisher that it's perfectly ok, and even preferable to turn down an inferior effort..moreover, a service to the public. Kind of tarnishes the pleasant memories I have of Ms. Rice's prior efforts. Anyone reading this review, take Lestat's advice..skip chapter one..then skip the rest."
1,disappointed,"i really wanted to read this book as it tied together and ended both the lestat series and the taltos series, which i really desired closure on. unfortunately, i'd rather have lived w/o the closure provided in this terrible ""novel"", which had nothing novel about it. i nearly quit after the first two chapters where anne/lestat rant and rant about unloyal fans for not adoring memnoch the devil. talk about huge ego. and my initial excitement about mayfairs and lestat (confession,skipped blackwood farm, now glad i didn't waste time/money)in the same story made me nearly gag. why does everybody-male female human vampire taltos whatever-fall in love with miserable rowan mayfair? so very disappointed. high hopes, crashed and burned. don't waste your time and money. find anything else. like an essay by an uninterested 3rd grader failing english class."
1,What a waste,"Ms. Rice has lost her ability to write, keeps churning out junk.Hopefully her ""turn to Jesus"" won't make people sick as well.This wasn't worth the price paid, especially if you enjoyed ""Interview with the Vampire/Vampire Listat."" It's a put down of her earlier works, when she was fresh."
1,"Thank God the chronicles are no more! Editing, please!","Illiterature at its most defining point. The plot and characters cruelly disjoint. This isn't writing that will edify, but typing: Word processing who can buy?"
3,Wimpire Lestat,"I am THRILLED about Mrs. Rice's apparent life choices and what appears to be progress toward regaining the ability to be happy. I believe it has effected (and affected) her writing as it ALWAYS HAS. The writing that kept us all spellbound came from a dark, and I think, unhealthy place. If her personal recovery means I pay for ONE less-than-exemplary book, I'll take it! Hurray for Anne! Thanks so much for all the wonderful tales, and I apologize for my, and my fellow readers SELFISHNESS. Bon Chance mon ami... :-)"
4,a swirling tour de force,"Ah Lestat, I've missed you! To be brief, I would say I loved this book, but that sort of gushiness doesn't suit an Anne Rice book.However, if you've become so enthralled with the Chronicles and all things vampyric, you seem to be disappointed. May I say that -in this world where too much tv and film are hopelessly predictable and derivitive- you may also be so wrapped in your visions of what Tom Cruise, I mean Lestat, would do that your derision of Blood Canticle was preordained.If you're so disappointed, get out a pen and proceed writing something original- not fanfic for the boards. Lestat is not yours.Beautiful, vivid, enthralling; I couldn't put it down - that's my most helpful review."
5,Knowing the series...,"I have to admit that I was quite suprised at the reviews written for Blood Canticle. To slander this wonderful and talented author and her work (the way it was done) is absolutely terrible.While this may not have been her best book, Anne Rice has still written a great book. I would only like to say that when you know the series and what it is about; when you've read every book; when you know and love every character, you should be able to see past the lingo/editing/plot lines. Because, aside from those things, Blood Canticle was still a part of the Vampire Chronicles. A true fan should be able to appreciate it for that reason alone."
1,"Ann, stop whining please","Yes, yes. We've read the articles about your assertions of your narcissism, which are within characer. And yes - some of us well understand that you just can't stand criticism, and must therefore rise to your own defense. We don't have to go back to the Tom Cruise debacle, do we? Or do we? Are you going to run some full page newspaper ads again?But you're making an idiot of yourself. Your recent comments don't play to a broad audience. Please stop whining and write something decent."
1,"Please, make it end!","This series should've stopped several books ago. How many people can Anne make into vampires and then force us to endure listening to their angst as they come to terms with enjoying that ultimate vampire orgasm which is drinking someone's blood? How many more side characters can she stretch out into full stories?My biggest disappointment was the ""love"" story between Rowan Mayfair and Lestat. It was unconvincing and contrived. One of the nicest parts of the Witching Hour was the romance between Michael and Rowan, which Anne proceeded to destroy in subsequent Mayfair books.This is a tired, tired series. Try doing a sequel to The Mummy, Anne."
1,What in God's name...?,"I wish I could say that it didn't deserve any stars, but this review format won't allow me that luxury. A gold star for effort I suppose.I want to know what happened to the Vampire Chronicles. They were amazing at first, true works of art that transformed my idea of vampires forever. But then they started to decline. That is, they started to decline once the witches were introduced.But I'm here to write about Blood Canticle, aren't I?Well, I still want to know what happened. It used to be that Lestat could contemplate for pages on end, but now there is never a page that doesn't have some half-hearted dialoge! What happened to the rich history and beautiful description?And, above all, what happened to all the old characters? The old coven that made me love these books more than any other horror novel?I miss the Chronicles. I miss them alot."
2,Not impressed,"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as it's beginning."
2,"Hello, Anne Rice, Are You There?","Let me start off by saying the story wasn't so bad, it was the execution of the story that was terrible.I was thrilled to see that Lestat played a major role in this story, until the dialog kicked in. He sounds like some metro, gangsta, surfer knock-off. He actually says ""dude"" all too frequently. Please.The story actually does a decent job tying the Mayfair Witch/Vampire scene together. It revolves around Quinn Blackwood and how he is struggling to deal with his fresh mortal life and his new vampiric existence. But, again, let me say that for the first time in any Rice book, Lestat killed it. I could not get passed the random, rambling soliloquy that popped up everywhere.Sorry, this one didn't do it for me."
2,Kill Me Now!,"I've read every one of Anne Rice's novels, and have graciously accepted Lestat being ""reborn,"" but I can not accept Lestat becoming such a bore. The Brat Prince is now just a brat. Blackwood Farm deserves a classier follow-up. I miss the great storytelling author who wrote ""The Witching Hour."" What happened?"
1,"Oh god, ricey, go back to your pulp heaven","Pretentious authors always think it blasphemy to criticize their work--and the greater the hack, the greater the defense of his crap. Thus cometh American Hack Rice, who tries so pathetically to equal herself to Stephen King and, with this worthless defense of her novel, proves herself to be simpy Diane Steel with vampires.No, dear Anne, you are no great writer, and this work is certainly the worst of your Lestat chronicles. I read your works from a library on a beach--when, of course, there are no boy bandson the radio to distract my attention (their intelligence equals yours).So please, take your fictional greatness and go back to your fictional world where you are a wonderful writer. I must leave-- the Backstreet Boys have a live concert coming up."
2,What you're all forgetting....,"I don't have anything to say about the book that others haven't already said. However, many of you are saying that this is your last of the vampire or witch chronicles and you're more than right about that. In fact, you don't even have a choice. Anne Rice has stated multiple times in her phone messages that this is the last novel she will ever write about vampires or witches. I think it's pretty disappointing for a final bow out."
1,What the... Where is my Brat Prince? I give it NO STAR!,"Well what can I say, I truly don't even know where to start.Where Anne is the Brat Prince of old, where is our Lestat, what have you done to Lestat? A saint Anne our Brat Prince wishes to be a saint he wishes to possess a soul... what a joke. Quine Blackwood, Mona , Rowan, & Michael Mayfair, a few ghosts and some shattered Taltos, this is who you end the sage with... where Anne is Louie, Pandora, Armand, David, and the rest. Where have they all gone, have they been forgotten by you? Well not by me. ""Blood Canticle"" was a joke along with ""Blackwood Farm"". No story, no plot, no action, no feeling, no heart, no soul, it was empty I am left feeling heart broken. Sad is my heart. Where is my Lestat of old, where is our Vampire family? Come out, come out, where ever you are?"
3,Good Vampire Stories,"Like all of Anne Rice's vampire novels I found this one to be entertaining. If you are looking for better, read Mick Farren's Rehnquist trilogy. Lestat is mediocre next to Victor Rehnquist."
1,Annoying,"This is the first book of this author I was exposed to. I did not like the story, the plot etc. I think it was not a good book. But having to listen the narrator added to the pain. He changes from a man's voice to a woman voice, from one accent to another, and that was not only extremely annoying, but almost comical."
3,Maybe I'm just a crazed fan girl,"I've just finished the book and I feel deflated. I tore through it in two days, which indicates that it was a good read, but really I think I was looking for some substance, the substance that crams some of Rice's best work, the substance that positively possessed The Witching Hour, which is for me her best work. And therein lies my problem I guess, I've never liked the Taltos storyline that resulted from this great book, I've never liked what the consequent trauma did to the characters of Rowan Mayfair and Michael Curry. I think I tore through the book hoping that Rowan would come to her senses, that she could cease walking with God and return to Michael.But in the end does any Rice character of importance ever escape the voracious appetite of Lestat?"
1,Quantity over Quality,"This book is the worst effort by Anne Rice. It feels like she phoned it in. I always hoped that she would merge the Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Saga. This is a sore disappointment. Lestat's quest for sainthood and his sudden passion for Rowan Mayfair are so far fetched it is almost funny. I will sincerely think twice before picking up another of Ms. Rice's books. Perhaps her genius departed with the unfortunate passing of Stan Rice. Maybe her stories could be more foreceful if she concentrated on one book per year like most other writers instead of cranking out two per year as has been the case lately. If you are contemplating reading this book, don't bother, save your time. This is the flop to end all flops."
1,how disappointing,I am sorry to say that this book realy does not live up to the previous books in this series. It seemed not to be even written by the same author. Mrs. Rice seems to be stretching to get just one more book out of the character lestat.
1,cannot believe it!!!,"I'm a compulsive reader, many times I've read books I didn't like, I have no problem with commenting about that. What I DO have a problem with is supposed ""fans"" of an author slandering her in the maner of some of you here. If you didn't like the book, so be it, best luck next time; it happens, unless you read all books before buying them you are gonna end up with some you dislike; and say you didn't like it, advise others about the problems you encountered, etc. thats very welcome! But don't go after the author with such malevolence!!! Is unvelievable!!!.Many times, when the author of a book was unknown to me, I read the reviews to help me decide if I may like it, many times it helped me in the past. But never before have I encountered such vicious reviews. I found they speak more in detriment of who ever wrote them than of the book or the author. It's a real shame!!."
2,Disappointed................,"I've been a Vampire Chronicle lover since I read The Vampire Lestat and have followed closely every single new Vampire Chronicles. I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books."
2,"Oh, Anne...","Dear, dearest Anne. We love you. But whatever happened with those perfectly defined, coherent, fresh characters of both sagas, and with their convincingly complex worlds? Please, please, give us a great finale worthy of your talent before you change directions. I propose that you write for us a ""Book of Revelation. The last Chronicle."""
1,How awful,"I'm trying hard to finish this book. But it is so hard to think that Lestat would say any of the ""cool"" words that Anne writes. ""Give ME a break"" Anne, you really should have an editor or at least someone that would read your book before you send it off to print. And, let that person be honest.How very disapointing for a finale."
2,Not impressed,"I believe this will go down as my least favorite of the Vampire Chronicles. How disappointing to find that the book held little interest to me after the first few chapters, especially when I could barely put Blackwood Farm down once I started it. I guess my expectations were so much higher than they should have been. I expected a lot more from one of my favorite authors. This book picks up immediately after Blackwood Farm ends and goes off into a lot of repetition which I assume is for those readers who did not read the The Witching Hour, Lasher, and Taltos. If you're an Anne Rice fan than you more than likely read them all so this one was boring and repetitive...and had me wishing the book would move along to something new and exciting. It never got to that point. It's ending was as disappointing as the beginning."
3,not anne rice's best,"This book is better than most of the books that I've read, but it's one of the worst of Anne Rice's books. Characters are supposed to mature over time, but come on, Lestat wanting to become a saint? That is just too much. What happened to the Lestat in Interveiw, the guy that you love to hate? What happened to the brat prince? This would be a good read for those who aren't familar with Anne Rice and her books, but for those of us who are, this book is depressing. I gave this book three stars because Lestat is narrating the book again, and there are parts in the the book that send chills down you back, but they are few and far between."
1,Ugh...,This is the second wrost vampire novel I have ever read. The top of my list being Whitley Strieber's The Last Vampire. I used to think I disliked Memnoch The Devil but then I read this....
2,Big Disappointment,"I was very diappointed with this book. It was an easy read but the meanings of the stories felt to me, that Anne rice didn't want to write this. It felt like she rushed it just to meet her deadline. Let me first start by saying that we never knew at the end of ""Taltos"" what happened to Ash and Morrigan. That book ended good and the I did not feel that we had to go through that again and really find out what happened to them. Lestat was marvelous as always but I didn't think that the witches and vampires should have been brought together in such a way. They should have been kept separate. I would tell any Anne Rice fan to read this book but I can only hope that her next will be better."
1,Worst Vampire Chronicle ever,"What a depressing end to an amazing series. Of course it hasn't been good since after Memnoch the Devil, but in this book, Lestat is not himself, none of our other favorite characters dare touch it with a 20 foot pole, and what little plot there is is incomprehensible. More of a vehicle for the author to voice her thoughts on issues and religion than a novel. This ""Lestat"" is nothing like the Brat Prince we know and love. Tempers run high and there's more drama than a high school gym without any reason for it. And plot? What plot? Not to mention it contradicts lots of previously established things. For example, Lestat ""I can hack into police computers in ToTBT"" de Lioncourt doesn't know what e-mail is? You're kidding right.Waste of money, waste of time. Very depressing."
1,What happened to Lestat!?!?!,"I have read almost every one of Anne Rice's novels, and I have to say this is the worst one. Usually the language is poetic, yet forceful, and in this one, I thought Lestat seemed scattered and stupid. Suddenly, everything and everyone was ""facinating"". He talks like a 17-year old surfer, not a 200-year old well-read vampire. It almost seems like it was written by a different person. I can blame Anne Rice for some of it (though the story was good) but the editing was terrible (a slow downward trend has been noticeable for some time). Has she made so much money now that no one is going to tell her that she needs to FOCUS... not babble? Someone needed to take the fluff out of this book, but didn't."
1,Why isn't ZERO stars an option?,"These reviews are more entertaining than this terribly written book! As a young reader I have read more intellectual content in the pages of Harry Potter! Yes Anne, thank god it's over because I doubt anyone wants to waste any more time and money."
4,Couldn't put it down!,"I loved this book. I have read all of the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching series and to bring them together like this was great. I love how Lestat tells this story, great job!"
2,This is how it ends?,"I have read all of Anne's vampire books and have, for the most part, loved each one in it's own right. This, however, is such a departure in writing style, story-line and intensity, that I am shocked it was written by the same woman who brought us timeless stories of other vampires. Lestat seems to be written like an 18 year old surfer, using the word ""dude"" too many times for me to count. Mona is detached and cold. Quinn is a stumbling fool. This book lacks Lestat's charm, it also lacks Louis, Marius, Armand, Pandora and every other entertaing character she has previously brought to life. I am sad this is her last chronicle. I am more sad that this is how the chronicle ended, which such a disappointing book."
2,Not the best,"It wasn't ""horrible"" but it was certainly not her best. The style doesn't seem at all similar to her usual stuff. I found it very disjointed and had a hard time following the story line. I think the reviews would be worse had it not been a chronicle book.I would probably read it, even with the fact I know it isn't a great book, to keep the story together. Lestat did not seem like Lestat. I read Blackwood farm a few days earlier and it was much better than Blood canticle."
4,"please come back to the dark side, anne rice!","To be honest, I was too excited about the storyline with the witches and vampires coming together to even notice the writing (good or bad, although normally I'm pretty picky about these things). Then again, I was always that kid who got super hyped up when two cartoons merged forces for an hour long special against an especially difficult villain. I was SO looking forward to the next book- until I found out there wasn't going to be one (at least not one I want to read)! I am so bummed out that one of my favorite writers has decided to write solely about her religion. Another one bites the dust! But- I do still love this book."
2,It wasn't what i expected,"Anne Rice has been one of my favorite authors of all times and i have enjoyed all her vampire novels. Expecting this book to be the same, i was dissapointed throughout the whole book. I did not read the Mayfair witch series because I wasn't interested in them in the first place. When she combined the two series together, i felt so lost and wondered why in the first place Anne Rice would do that. It was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this book."
3,the last???,"i have read all of anne rices books x2, and i am very sad to see lestat and all the others go out like this. louis? armond? pandora? i love anne rice, but am very disappointed. drug lords, come on now, much more carnage then needed. julian was never scared of anyone, and mona was such a better character then that."
5,A wonderful and delightful book!,"I'm avid reader and also an Anne Rice fan for decades. I fell in love which each book for their uniqueness and for the difference between each. There was a new world in each book. This book (and also the others) cannot be compared to each other. I always open a book with my own expectations and this one has meet all of them. Is fresh, new and not like any other. That's what makes a good book and a great writer. Unfortunately not all people can accept the fact that is HER book and she can direct her story and shape her characters which ever way she wants.Intriguing and intoxicating... give it a try.And for those of you who have enough time to bash at someone you don't even know to attack her directly; I'll be patiently waiting for your own book to come out."
1,Dissapointing Lestat and Anne Rice,"I used to wait eagerly for a book of Anne Rice and her Vampires Chronicles saga, sadly I will not be doing it anymore. Let's hope, for our sake that Anne Rice recovers her wit and writes more interesting books."
1,Don't be fooled by the author's name.,"Apparently Anne Rice has decided to sacrifice quality for being on the best-seller list. Having read all of her books, I was hopeful after reading Blackwood Farm, but not anymore. If you want to read great Anne Rice, try the Vampire Chronicles before Memnoch and the Mayfair witches before Canticle. She's turned into the McCaffrey of horror, writing more for money than quality. This book is a disgrace to the fans and to their beloved Brat Prince."
2,What Happened,"This book was hard to get through. Being a fan of Lestat, it was hard for me to accept that out of nowhere he starts talking like Brandon Kutcher. Saying ""that's cool man"" and ""dude."" It ruined it for me."
4,The Fans Have Failed,"While this book may have been short and lacking the usual poetry we have come to expect from Anne Rice it is, I feel our own fault. She states in the book that while MtD may have sold well, fans did not get it. Notice how up until Lestat's rant in the begining of BC she eluded to another book of his journeys with angels? She has realized that many fans don't seem to want to read what she wants to write. So she has written a book for the masses. She was trying to satisfy all the readers who seem to want a continuation of the story rather than her usual poetry. It is our own fault for not letting her know how awesome MtD really was. Shame on us for not supporting her when she wrote from her heart. Stan's death I am sure was a factor. But she has shown in the past the her greatest writing is done when she herself is at her lowest. It is her escape. We have no one to blame but our selves. Long live Lestat!!"
3,hmm..,"i haven't read Blood Canticle but i can't wait because i'm such a huge fan of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. I agree, Armand was just so so boring..i couldn't put myself to reading it. But wow..the reviews for Blood Canticle..i hope it isn't as bad as every one says it is. Though i would love to see Marius and Pandora back in."
1,I'm warning you...it's NOT worth it even free!,"This book was terrible!!! I cannot stress to you how bad this book is, and I have been waiting for it for so long! I feel so cheated! Where is the Anne Rice of The Witching Hour?"
1,***,"I can't believe that anyone who has ever had a passion for Anne rice books can not tell that She did not completely write this on her own. I live in lousisana and Mrs Anne Rice has been reported to very ill, besides losing her husband this past year.She has been reported to have last stages of diabetes and has been seen needing asistance with small tasks. I just wish that she isn't obligated to produce books because of her contract. So please take heart Because everyone here in the big easy knows how fragile she is"
2,The Un-Hits Just Keep On Coming,"Oh, I ""get it"" alright. This book is rushed from beginning to end. All the descriptions, a highlight of most Anne Rice books, are complete asides, and even written in parentheticals as if to underscore that AR does not feel like describing things any more. I love the character of Lestat, and there may have been some minor advancements, but the best thing I can say about this race to wrap up the story of the Taltos was that it was a quick read. Lacks the density and richness of the other books. I was not crazy about Menmnoch, but still found it an interesting read."
1,Awful...,"Why waste my time with an extensive review? Anne Rice can't even be bothered to even attempt a half-way decent novel. I mean ""Yo"", ""Little Bro""... that's just stupid.Plain and simple, ""Blood Canticle"" is a disaster. Anne Rice's book contract should be torn up, and she should retire before she humiliates herself any further."
1,A bad book...,"Oscar Wilde once said that there's no such thing as a bad book, just badly written ones. Well, this was definitely a badly written book. It's very inconsistant with the characters and personalities in the other novels and I certainly would not call what she's done with the character of Lestat maturing. A terrible, terrible way to end it. It should have stopped at Memnoch the Devil. There is such a thing as over kill.For those starting out The Vampire Chronicles should be read in order...Interview with The VampireThe Vampire LestatThe queen of the damnedThe Tale of the body thiefMemnoch The DevilPandoraVittorio The VampireThe Vampire ArmandMerrickBlood and GoldBlackwood FarmBlood CanticleYou want Lestat, take my advice, stick with the novel with his name in the title."
1,An Annoying Read,"This has to be the most forced out book I read and one that is total incredulous (vampire stories are anyway, but it still has to make sense). Heck, no one talks like the way Lestat talks! Get real! Slang is ok, but carried to extreme as AR does it becomes tiring and just plain irritating. It takes the focus off the story. I had to put it down after 50 pages. What's the matter with you AR? You've written enough books to know that. My guess is you needed the money to pay your bills and you weren't inspired or had any stories left in you. The BC, rather than being a labour of love is more like the results of constipation. I think I'll send it back to you for a full refund like you suggest in your litany and I hope other paying customers that you offend do likewise. Maybe you'll be more grateful and perhaps a little more humble."
2,Disappointing,"I fell in love with Rowan Mayfair in Rice's previous works, but am disappointed with her character in Blood Canticle. Poor Michael... that's all I have to say. Well, one can't be good all the time, right? I like you, Rice, & will keep on looking out for your books."
2,Take your medicine (Finish the Chronicles),"I was sorely dissapointed with this book. It's the only book in the series which I didn't enjoy. While it has it's good/bad points, mostly bad, I didn't feel like it was part of the same series of books. It should have been part of the Mayfair witches series, guest starring 2 vampires! But, I respect her as a writer, and believe that no one knows the characters better than she, so it must be right. I wasn't expecting anything cataclysmic in the end, so I wasn't shocked by the ending...it left an opening for a new book, if she ever wants to pick them up in the future. Even though this book was horribly dull, ""slightly racist"",about everything but vampires,and drenched with religion, I would still read a new book if she continued. In conclusion, die-hard fans only need read--and get it from the library, unless you're building a collection."
2,Editing?,"The story itself was wonderful and highly recommended for Anne Rice fans but the editing of the Kindle version was terrible. In addition to spelling mistakes there were also quite a few instances where whole words were replaced with incorrect ones! Examples; several times the word ""mat"" was used when it should have been ""that"" and ""dunking"" instead of ""thinking"". While I could guess the correct word it detracted from the story. Not sure how the editing process works for Kindle books but someone obviously didn't do their job on this one. Very disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"I am an avid Anne Rice fan. I have read and reread the Vampire Chronicles and the Witching Hour series. They are excellent. This final book, however, is very disappointing. First, Anne should be very careful when she is complaining through Lestat in the first chapter. It isn't Lestat, it's Anne, and it's obvious. I wished for so much more. I am rereading the Witching Hour just to get this book out of my mind."
1,Deja Vu,"Geez...I get that feeling that I've read the same books over and over. I am still struggling with Blood and Gold, such a dozer. Merrick was substandard. Merrick who was not included anywhere in the Mayfair Witches becomes a vampire. Why tamper with something great like ""The Witching Hour"". It was such a great read - imaginative, piques your interest. I don't intend to buy Blackwood or Blood Canticle. And don't get me started with the ""New Tales of Vampires"" collection. Please, stop ruining your tremendous books, Anne. ""Interview with the Vampire"" gave me goosebumps...now it's just goose...."
1,Since when???,"I have not read this book yet (I live in a rural town that isn't selling it- about 8 copies of Blackwood are in the bargan box at the book store, when Anne was insanely popular here when I was in school). I was about to buy it, but Anne's obvously gone mad. Am I the only one who remembers that vampires can't see ghosts? Maharet clearly articulates this in QoTD. Yet ever since Memnoch and Roger's haunting (which outraged me) ghost have been in almost (if not every) future chronicle. Why?? no explanation is given for Maharet saying this nor for vampires like Armand who, if his story is to be taken serious, knows of ghosts. Anne runs out of ideas and breaks her own rules."
1,Take the money and hide.,"To sum it up, Anne if you had not been a published writer this book would have been trashed. I can't beleive any one would pay money for this."
2,End of a Saga,"The best I can say is that it was good to finally put the wraps on a series I began reading in the late 70's when Interview came out, but it's clear MS Rice's heart was not really in this book. Probably a contractual fullfilment."
4,"Not her best, but not all that bad, either.","The problem with this book, is that it's set in modern day times, and there's not a lot that we don't know about the vampires now. The story is pretty much an everyday life tale of Lestat and his latest 'coven'. Of course there is the part about the Mayfairs and the unnatural offspring, but that part wasn't all that interesting to me. I wish that Anne would write more books about new and different vampires, older vampires from different places and tell their life stories. That is the books I like the best. Lestat has already told his story, so we know all about him and his spoiled self. A life story for Mael would be nice."
4,Hmmmmmmm....,"Our dear Lestat is back, and this time he's gotten hip with the times. (Sometimes to excess, but what can I say? It's probably intentional..) Like most of Mrs. Rice's books, this one reads through at a good clip, then allows you to go back and reread for the deeper meanings and complexities that exist in her novels. And Lestat's criticism of his ""Dear Readers"" was delightful! I laughed out loud. The plot may get a bit silly, with half human drug lords and such, but overall, our narrator ...well, narrates... with his unmistakeable style. If this is truly Lestat's last book , then by the end at least we all know that he finally did something RIGHT."
4,Had a little bit of everything,"This was a really good book. It had a little bit of everything.A little too much romance for me. I am not a romance kinda persongimme a good horror or mystery, but this was good it didnt go toooverboard with the romance, I did like the plot and thoughtit was well written. I liked the characters. I thought it wasbelievable and liked the outcome. It had twists and turns andkept you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed it."
4,Not bad!,"Alex Graham, a photo journalist has seen something that she wasn't suppose to, while assisting in the cleanup of a ""seemingly natural disaster"". While recovering, someone attempts to take her life while she is riding with Sarah and her trusted rescue dog, Monty. Fearing for his wife's life, John asks Galen to find someone who can protect his wife, hence Judd Morgan. All of these characters are reoccurring in the series, so you will recognize them, even Elena. Filled with romance, espionage, terrorist attacks, revenge and conspiracy, this is an entertaining read. Read along as Alex and Judd fight the clock to save the President's life."
1,Get On With IT!!!,"Ok. Can we please, please stop with the cookie-cutter books? I mean it's been girl gets in trouble. Male protects girl. Male has troubles of his own. Male beats up people. Female gets pissed. Female beats up people. Male and female get together when the female ""gives in"". Male and female live happily ever after. Until for some odd reason Iris can't think up NEW characters so she recycles her old ones. Bangs head against table repeatedly. The last book of hers I read; I knew the villain when you first meet him. I mean c'mon. This road's been trampled to death. Either think up a new story or stop wasting trees."
2,Why am I not surprised? Clear as mud,"Why am I not surprised? Ms.Johansen confirms what I knew, my female collegues don't know how to truly write suspense. The golden retriever Monty is mentioned in connection with the search-and-rescue-team, but the main figure is a two legged friend Alex, the photographerix. She has guts, foul language and braves a lot of adversities coming from the Homeland Security Team, FBI, CIA etc. Why? Good question. They like to blow up dams and mines and the President, and of course Alex is opposed to that and is therefore on the wanted list. Makes sense? The whole story is clear as mud. Best you make a list of all the players at the start, because there are plenty and sometimes you meet them by their first name and sometimes by their last. Who is who? You go back and forth. See for yourself."
1,Waste of time,"I have never written a review before but I couldn't let this go. I had heard good things about Iris Johansen's books so I thought I would give it a try. It was such a disappointment. I made myself finish it but actually started another book so that I had something thoughtful to read while working my way through her book. The characters were as cliche as I have ever read. The plot didn't excite me. Unless it was free, I would never read another of Johansen's books. She obviously rides on her past performance as an author and that is unfair to all those that pour their hearts into each book."
4,"Still good,",Following this series for quite sometime now I'd like to say this writer is still holding my attention.
5,Good enough,"She is not so well documented as Robert Crais or David Baldacci among others but this book will keep you reading, part of the story is the same as The Hammer of Eden by Ken Follett and that makes a little boring the story if you already read that book, that doesn't mean that you don't have to read this book if you already read The Hammer of Eden.The end of the book is predictable but very good, is an easy book to read, not a thriller but good enough for a long flight or a day at the beach."
2,What a disappointment !,I eagerly awaited this new book as I had read every one of her books before. I can only say that I feel really disappointed that this book is so below her other efforts. I kept having to check the author's name because I felt I was reading an Elizabeth Lowell story! All those phrases in italics is exactly how Elizabeth Lowell writes her stories. Come on Iris you can do better than this.
2,Fuhgeddabaudit!!,"This was a very disappointing book. So much so, that I will probably never purchase another by this author. The plot drifts - the ending is virtually non-existent. The book conveniently skips over what could have been considered the climax of the plot. Instead, a chapter ends - and the ending begins --- saves so much time in actually developing a plot! Use words like --- Feelings! What am I thinking!? I can't feel that! ---- good grief! thin, thin, thin.....lazy lazy lazy...too bad the author is resting on her laurels - easy money, terrible product."
3,Same Old Same Old,"One of the earlier reviewers used this phrase, and it is totally apt. I challenge anyone to tell me the difference between Joe, Logan, Galen and Morgan, or between Eve, Sarah, Elena and Alex. The fact is, there is no difference. All of her recent characters are interchangeable, and all of her plots are basically the same, with the same annoying and stilted dialogue. All that said, the author still somehow manages to create a fast paced and interesting story, and even makes the reader root for her copycat characters. This author is clearly just writing the same thing over and over again because it's easy and it sells. It's too bad because even this repetitive stuff is 3-star, but she could so easily be 5 star with a little freshness and ingenuity in her work."
2,DISSAPOINTING,"After reading Ugly Duckling and Reap the Wing, which were both excellent and exciting from beginning to end, this book was hardto get into. I did manage to finish it in one day, but cannot say it is a must read."
3,I agree with the other reviews,"If you want to read a good book find one of the authors early ones that are not part of the Eve Duncan series. This one seemed to be a little too focused on updating the reader from all the other Eve Duncan books, but still missed a few characters. I think taking Galen in a new direction was not such a great idea because I did miss his usual presence in this book. He was there but in a different way."
5,"""Loved this story!""",I don't get it! I mean the mean reviews of this book. Dead Aim is a terrific story! Buy the book and see for yourself. This story rocks!
5,LOVE IT,"I LOVE IRIS JOHANSEN!!!! ALL OF THE BOOKS I HAVE READ OF HERS ARE GREAT!!!!! READ THEM, YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!"
2,Mediocre and amateurish,"This is the first and last Iris Johansen I'll read. I was expecting better. The plot is just silly and the dialogue is amateurish. This book reads as if it were written by an untalented high schooler for English class. Save your money, and read something by Janet Evanovich, Dorothy Gilman, Lee Child, Nelson Demille, or Dick Francis instead."
1,not for a rabbit,When i assembled the cage and pen...and placed my rabbit in it. within minutes my rabbit started to naw threw the mat. she also started to naw threw the velcrow. It works well as a cover where the rabbit cant reach it..but definitely not a mat!
1,Do not buy this product for your rabbit,"I wrote a review on the smaller pen also, but I want to post it here to warn rabbit owners. These pens are very dangerous because they are known to come unlatched. When this happens the curious little rabbits like to see if they can get out, for us and others this resulted in the death of the rabbit. I recommend a pen built for dogs to house your rabbits in. These seemed like a great idea at the time, but if you value your rabbit, do not buy."
2,Playpen for bunnies....,"I saw a post on how these could be dangerous for rabbits and wanted to add my 2 cents. I also have one that my 2 rabbits are currently housed in and yes, they get out! They've gotten out about 4 times in about 3 weeks. They also chew the matt/cover. I will be purchasing them something else to live in. Be very careful!"
1,pink doesn't reflect,"I had been impressed by the video, but was disapoointed, the pink doesn't really reflect, defeating the entire idea."
5,2nd pair!! :),"I ordered my first pair of these exactly a year ago and wore them 4-5 days a week through heat, rain and cold. I am excited to order them again! Very durable and worth the $$$"
2,disapointing,"Ordered the blue and they don't work as in the video at all, still my son who is 5 think of them as cool but to me it was just a waste of money since they don't serve the purpose I intended when I bought them. It could be that the blue is not the best colour to chose, if you still want to get them, try yellow or white they might work better."
2,price performance ratio disappointing,The plastic coating seems to have dampened the reflective intensity of the illumination and it's not even close to what the demo video has shown. Very disappointing!
4,have not been hit by a truck..,so far so good on the reflector pop bands. cars and trucks seem to see me better because i run at night. i where them around my ankles. if you where short socks they rub a little but all in all a great product...
3,Good but I lost one,"It is good, very reflective. But I feel a little pricy still. And I lost one out of a pair after one cycling trip, maybe medium size is too short."
3,become rigid when you fold them out,"I got yellow, seem cheap but may last 1 year or so. They become rigid when you fold them out then you ""slap"" them onto your ankle, wrist, forehead, etc. I have yet to see if they are reflective up to 1500 feet as stated with car lights. Material complies with ANSI 107-2004 (traffic visibilty code) so they must be decent at least. Probably doesn't hurt to have them around you when riding a bike.Planet Bike BRT Strap Multi-Use LED Bicycle Safety Light"
3,Mediocre book,"The first half of the book is decent, where it goes over different types of novelty yarn and fibers. The projects are not great, and would be expensive to replicate since they use several types of novelty yarns in each item. None of the patterns were my style. I bought it to learn about how best to knit the different yarns I see in the shops, but I didn't really feel there was enough information about the different yarns presented. A book you would look through one time and probably not pick up again."
2,I wanted to like this book...but did not,"I bought this book to solve a problem I have a fairly large backstock of a novelty yarn and when the purchasing haze cleared, I wasn't sure what I'd do with it. I was hoping this book would give me ideas....especially on work-a-bility of patterns with challenging yarn. That is perhaps not a fair test, I admit.This book is loaded with designs for fizzy, hairy yarns. As a result, everything looks very dated. I found almost nothing that would work with ""my"" novelty yarn, a slubby Gedifra number. I would wear almost nothing I see in this book."
2,Switching noise using HDMI,"Excellent sound quality, not too hard to set up but when using my PS3 through the HDMI input, the receiver produced a loud switching noise every time the audio over HDMI went on and off. This happened for example when starting/stopping a movie. It was so loud and weird that I feared damaging my speakers so I returned the unit. Totally unacceptable. I thought it was my unit , but apparently other people have experienced it as well.Got a Yamaha 661 for $25 more and I don't get the weird noises anymore."
4,onkyo sr 604: almost perfect,"In general, I am very satisfied with this receiver.My main disapointment: Not being able to use the 'late night' sound compression feature with an external XM tuner (Delphi SkyFi) or other analog sources."
4,Excellent Receiver,"This receiver is excellent. I just received it and it was a breeze to setup. Sounds amazing with my in wall speakers. The codes for Directv don't work at all. No problem, I will purchase a Logitech Harmony remote. I researched this product for months before deciding to go with this one. The HDMI feature is pretty useless. I plan on using the component connections anyway. I will definitely stay with Onkyo."
4,Mostly good,Has two HDMI inputs one out to monitor just what the doctor ordered!However you have to use an s-video cable to monitor for the on screen setup display. Why? that is the biggest problem with this receiver. Sounds great easy to set up with auto configure.
2,Nothing but boring...,"So the story is cool, some of the imagery is cool, but Josh Hartnett as a detective? No. Also, the pace was slow, and really did not give us much of an ending either.Now, I am a big advocate of a movie with subtlety, which most people find slow and boring, but this is slow and boring, and without subtlety. Just a reason to put Mia Kirshner in some sexy scenes before she is killed.Now, this was based on a true event from many years ago, and with true stories, Hollywood normally jazzes them up a bit. Now here, the story was changed and they added some stuff, but you know, it really did not add much to the movie. In the end, the movie is not about the murder or trying to catch a killer, it is about trying to gets more girls to woo over this Josh Hartnett person that can't act to save his life."
2,as bloodless and lifeless as the title character,"Granted we realise that De Palma has had more misses than hits over his career but when he hits, he does it so well and with great movies like Scarface and The Untouchables on his CV, I for one thought Ellroy's The Black Dahlia would be a great fit. I loved the book but realise that Ellroy's prose and complex plotting do not make for easy transition to the screen. But it can be done. Hello LA Confidential. And so the incomprehensible mess that is The Black Dahlia is just a major, major disappointment. Even for one who has read the book it is unforgivably confusing! The film seems to have no focus and despite it looking fabulous it is completely devoid of life. And that's all before we get to the last 30 minutes! Now I love high camp as much as the next person but the film's last scene is just laughable - and unfortunately not in a good way. A shame."
2,This just goes nowhere.,"This movie is 2 hours and two minutes long, and it really leads to a bland ending. The story is long and thin, and by the time it gets to the end, I forgot what the significance was supposed to be. The camera work was very stylistic and artsy, but that does not make up for just a plain poor story. This is supposed to be a story about two ex boxers who make detective rank, and then become obscessed with horrific murder of a young woman. That ends up being one of many sub plots which just tie this story into one giant tangle of weak, uniteresting plots that I did not care to find out one way or another about. Save your money, let others watch this for you, and give you a synopsis later"
1,Simply TRASH!,"""The Black Dahlia"", while referring to the most savage and unsolved murder in Los Angeles' history, was the most insensitive, cluttered, barely accurate, and gruseome films of 2006. The plot skipped around so much that I could hardly tell if I was watching a film or a collection of mystery outtakes from the cutting room floor when real film was physically edited.A true waste of time, money and sensibilities. When complete I simply ejected it and threw it in the trash.If there ever was a truly enticing and potential edge of you seat mystery to be made this could have been one of them. As is, it failed miserably."
1,De Palma's worst..?,"I really like De Palma -- especially old school De Palma -- but this movie is every bit as bad as Snake Eyes, if not worse. Imagine L.A. Confidential failing on EVERY level, and you have The Black Dahlia. Remarkably disappointing."
3,eh...,"The first time i watched it was good, the second time I saw it was not so good. Don't ask why i saw it two times, but I did. This film just seemed to get longer and more boring the second time around. This is definitely a movie to see at least once, but to see again, nope."
1,A candidate for the worst movie of the deacde,"No plot, no acting, no story. Plenty of fake blood, they must have had a fake blood sale at the 99 cent store. Possibly made by first year film school drop-outs"
2,Waste,Don't waste your time on this movie inspired by the worst unsolved murder in California history. Two cops investigate the murder. I thought it could've been a lot better.
2,"shouldn't the movie be about, you know, the subject of the movie?","I just finished watching on TV. As the reviewer, stated, I had no clue who was who, what was what, who did what to whom?Shouldn't a movie about Elizabeth Short(aka ""the black dahlia"") be, you know, about Elizabeth Short?Why only a peripheral view of the murder instead being the main focus? This was a bad film with actors spouting cliched/bad dialogue. Avoid if you're thinking of buying. Better off watching it and then decide."
1,The Black Death,"Sort of ""The Big Sleep"" on meth. De Palma clearly wants to revive the classic film noir experience but has instead created a monster, a movie that is more undead than alive. Who would have guessed just how bad Hillary Swank and Scarlet Johansson could be? It takes an iron will to watch this to the end, but unless you do, you can't truely appreciate the depth to which De Palma is willing to plunge in his exciting denouement. Quite possibly the worst movie of the year, an Ed Wood movie on a major Hollywood budget."
2,Hard to stay awake.,"I found that this movie had a great ending, but that was the only part. My husband fell asleep, and I had to fight to the end. There is no build up of the story line. I did, however, enjoy that I was not expecting the ending that I got (although, I was extremely tired!) I don't recommend buying this movie, but if you are too curious, just rent it...don't make my mistake."
2,Lame.,"If you like the book by James Ellroy that this movie is based on, which I do, then you probably won't like the movie very much. If you've never read the book, then you will be utterly confused by the ending. Either way you probably won't enjoy the movie. It's not the fault of the actors. The performances are good all around but when you're not given much to work with you can't expect miracles. I give the movie two stars only because of the performances and the design of the film which is very stylish. Other than that, the film's a real stinker."
1,don't waste your time,"i was hugely dissapointed in this film. i know it's based on a book, but the movie itself is nothing to rave about."
1,BETTER THAN A SLEEPING PILL,"The mostly negativ reviews say it all, so there is not much to add.All I can say is - what a BLOODY MESS! Don't waste your money or your time on this totally incoherent disaster."
1,Black Dahlia Murdered again,"I was looking forward to this film with great expectations. The book was masterfully written by Ellroy , but butchered by the film director making me question if he even read the book.What a hugh dissapointment."
1,WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW,I THOUGHT THEY HAD ALOT OF NERVE CALLING THIS MOVIE THE BLACK DAHLIA.I THINK ABOUT A WHOLE 15 MINUTES DEALT WITH THE CASE. I READ ALOT OF DIFFERENT BOOKS ON THE MURDER AND THOUGHT THIS MOVIE WAS A RIP-OFF. WHEN I WENT AND SAW THIS MOVIE A GOOD NUMBER OF PEOPLE WALKED OUT. DON'T WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE VIEWING THIS PIECE OF CRAP THEY CALL A MOVIE!
1,HORRIBLE film from a WONDERFUL book,"My title basically says it all. I will say to fans of Ellroy, the original book, etc. This film has NOTHING to do with those. They take some names, the Dahlia murder and mush it up with the worst, unbelieveable inane story. There is even a note at the very end of the film (which was too small for me to read on my tv screen) that said something like they use the characters and settings, but this is loosly based on the original novel.What was DePalma thinking? One could almost see a line of thought that said ""let's make another....L.A. Confidential...no wait! let's make it like an old 40's film...no wait! let's make it like ""Chinatown""! What they get is a horrible mess, a storyline that cannot be followed or believed and some of the absolute worst acting EVER!Unless you want to see the worst film ever made in this century, do not bother with this....read the book...or any James Ellroy instead."
1,Glossy Rubbish,"If you are interested in the Black Dahlia murder case and went into this film thinking it was going to be a dramatic, truth inspired tale centring around this murder then think again. This is hollow bollocks served up nice and glossy to cover up the fact this film has a vapid plot and uninspired acting. A real examination of the case would have been far more interesting then this over stylised nonsense."
2,"Confusing, slow, and sub par acting","Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie. The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short. But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to. Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!,"This is such a BAD movie. This film has no reason to title itself as ""The Black Dahlia"". They should at least tell you on the promo that this isn't based on the actual Black Dahlia murder instead of waiting til the end credits of the film to tell you the real reason why this movie is so dumb. But I guess no one would actually bother to go see it. If you're wanting to know about the REAL story then buy a book on it, it's alot more entertaining than this crap. Don't waste your time on this film. I'm sorry I did."
1,Bad acting anyone!?,"The Black Dahlia is hideous and I'm being kind here. I can't believe this movie is directed by Brian De Plama (Carrie, Dressed to Kill). He must have been desperate to direct this crap. Hilary Swank's acting is actually worse than Jost Hartnett's. The plot goes nowhere, the nude scenes are embarrassing, and the movie is shot in complete blackness, I could hardly make out a scene. I couldn't find one person who enjoyed this filth. The Black Dahlia is one of the worst films of 2006, now I know why this movie did horrible in the theaters."
2,The Black Dahlis Movie Review,"I was disappointed in how far the movie strayed from the original book by James Ellroy. The movie dragged along pretty slowly and wasn't too bad until the last 25 minutes. From the ""murder shed"" until the end it seemed like everyone was rushing to finish the film. Poor ending."
2,This movie was not that good.,This movie is only 5% Black Dahlia and 95% about the detective. It did not even focus that much on the Black Dahlia. When I saw this movie I wasn't even sure if I was in the right theatre. I thought I was watching a different movie. I think reading a book about the Black Dahlia is much better. I would wait till it comes out on DVD. Don't waist your money.
1,I've only myself to blame...,"I should have known better. I saw the reviews, I consider De Palma a derivative hack, but, I'm such a fan of the source material and Ellroy in general, I figured ""How badly could he have screwed it up?"" The answer: Completely.As usual De Palma makes a pastiche of mimicking his betters and the result is a boring, incoherent mess. That's two hours I won't get back. Don't make the same mistake I did."
3,"BRIAN DE PALMA, OPUS 27","I'd really like to see the uncut version in this case because it's impossible to summarize this novel with all its subplots in just two hours. The characters's behaviour isn't logical at all here and, unfortunately, the movie never creates the so peculiar mood found in every book written by James Ellroy. As it is, The Black Dahlia is a promising fim seriously ill."
1,More like a Venus Flytrap,"I struggled for 20 mins to latch on to something like coherence in THE BLACK DAHLIA...then gave up. Not only is it lacking a focused director & script, it trashes the victim (the audience along with Elizabeth Short, the woman behind the 'Black Dahlia.') It's a boring travesty & a bloody shame."
1,Don't bother,"I like many of De Palma's movies but when he directs a bad one they really stink.The book was to long and to good to make into a feature length movie. It might have been a good mini series except it was one of the most disturbingly graphic violent books I've read.So read the book, skip the movie."
1,WORST ACTING EVER,NOW I DID NOT BUY THE MOVIE THROUGH AMAZON BUT ANOTHER PLACE AND LET ME JUST TELL YOU THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN IT WAS 2 HOURS OF A WASTE OF MY TIME AND I STOPPED PAYING MUCH ATTENTION AFTER THE FIRST 10 MINUTES.I VE BEEN CURIOUS ABOUT THE BLACK DAHLIA MYSTERY FOR A FEW MONTHS NOW AND WAS CURIOUS TO SEE HOW THEY PORTRAYED IT IN THE MOVIES. AND LET ME SAY I WAS EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED THE ACTING WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE AND IM USUALLY A FAN OF JOSH HARNETTI DONT EVEN KNOW WHY SCARLET JO. WAS IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE HER ACTING WAS ALSO BAD IN IT AND THE MR. FIRE AND ICE THING JUST MADE IT ALL THE MORE WORSEI WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU SKIP THIS DVD AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE!
3,not movie of year but good,"there could of beent hings a little better but it kept my attention. i liked the back round making it look back in the 30-s or 40s i liked the atmosphere and how the crime scenes, the diffrent storires to me were decent."
2,Very Misleading,"I like many other people who wanted to see this movie actually thought it was going to be about the Black Dhalia murder. But the movie just went in circles and never really focused on the crime it self, It wasnt a crime movie I thought, And the dialouge was really hard to follow. I can see what they where trying to do but I dont think it worked at all. Oh and this movie is not at all acurate it is based on a novel written about 2 detectives and real facts about the case and the murder are few and far between. Overall i thought it was boring and really slow, Not worth buying, Maybe borrowing it from a friend or renting it."
1,What a Dud!!,"Wait, is that the sound of James Ellroy I hear, tuning in his grave? This movie sucks. It seems to have it all, plot, actors, Director, but completely misses. De Palma must have been asleep for most of the movie, the performances are appalling from actors who are capable of better.Maybe it's a paid advertisement for the cigarette industry? The only characters who don't smoke throughout are the dog and the corpse!What a waste of a great, great book."
1,Disappointing and Boring,I check this movie out at the library. I agree with the negative reviews of this film. It was awful and boring. Very poor plot.
1,Worse than Reefer Madness...,"i watched this with my friends because I hadn't seen a new movie for a long time, as I am a classic film fan (pre-1955) and i think this movie is pretty terrible. it's worse than Reefer Madness (1936). read the book instead. the one star is for the very 1940's style. i loved it. but this movie made me glad i like classics, because ""Black Dahlia"" is a very unwholsome movie about a time when Hollywood made nice, wholsome movies. sad to see that the quality of movies have gone down so much in the past 50/45 years, and this picture is proof of that. i mean, come on, i'm a kid and even i know that films today are getting worse and worse and that's why the theaters aren't as packed!"
1,time to retire BRIAN!,"Brian De Plma was one of my favorites. his Scarface was a masterpiese and his previous film ""Femme Fatal"" Although had some problems in scenario, but was wery intresting and enjoyable till the end. But here we have a superflat, super boring movie! I watched it cause i taught maybe it got better or had a surprise end. but it got worse and worse. Also the production had problems. God, Brian is getting old!"
1,Bad wannabe noir film......,"My boyfriend and I attempted to watch this really bad attempt of a noir film last night, and we were so bored and disinterested that we turned it off halfway thorugh. Within the first fifteen monutes of the film I sat there trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with this film. I came up with the following:-Bad acting. Josh Harnett is basically just a pretty face because the guy has almost no emotion at all. Plus, the guy was too young for the role. It made me grimace. All the other actors were okay. They were directed badly so it's not their fault they were in a bad movie.-Bad screenplay. The storyline made no sense at all. I was paying close attention to the plot and I couldn't quite get what was going on. The written dialogue was just plain bad.All in all this was a really bad film. Avoid it. If De Palma wants to take another stab at a noir film he ought to at least have a decent screenplay the next time around."
1,Abysmal,"Weird screenplay fulfilment of the novel.Hokey noir effort.Acting: None of the actors were at their best. Aaron Eckhart was perhaps the best, followed closely by Fiona Shaw as Mrs. Lindscott. From there the movie disappointed.The dialogue was very difficult to hear, we kept having to put the volume all the way up.The plot was confusing, especially at the beginning and end (when it's most important).Scarlett Johansson was almost likeable, but looked horrible and almost unattractive. She looked as if she were ill and didn't fit the part at all. Swank tried her best, but did not fully pull off Madeline Lindscott. And Josh Hartness, whose performance I enjoyed in ""LUCKY NUMBER SLEVEN"" seemed to sleepwalk through this one. I think he was too young or lacked character of facial expressions for the boring slow plotline. Mia Kirschner was entertaining as the murder victim herself, in those screentests which were hilarious."
1,It Will Cure Your Insomnia,"I was intrigued by a movie about the Black Dahlia murder, and thought I recall it getting decent reviews when it was in the theatres, but it was incredibly boring. Although I haven't read the book, it can't be as bad as this.Did they forget the movie was supposed to be about the Black Dahlia murder and the investigation? Instead, they relegated that to a subplot in a ridiculously long - and bad - love triangle movie. The sole bright spot was the performance of Mia Kirshner as Elizabeth Short, but that isn't worth sitting through 2 hours. What a huge disappointment."
1,IT IS REALLY A ZERO RATING.,THE MOVIE STARTS OUT PRETTY GOOD. THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES OR SO ARE DECENT. THEN IT DIVES STRAIGHT DOWN LIKE A NUCLEAR MISSLE. BUT CRASHES MUCH LOUDER. THIS MOVIE IS HORRIBLE.
2,wasted money and wasted time,"I only wish I saw the reviews before I bought the DVD. I happen to like Josh Hartnett and the list of the cast looked good. But the movie cheats at every point.It tries to look like a serious ""noir"" but then smth like Swank's heroine comes forward and it starts looking like a cheap comedy. Or Fiona Shaw with her histrionics - as somebody already noted here, it is so bad that it is actually fascinating to a certain point.Yohansson is two-dimensional (she usually is) and others are lucky if they reach even 2 dimensions.The overall impression was no-logic, no-visuals, and really cheap."
1,another bomb from Hilary Swank,"I have no idea why there has to be yet another take on the Black Dahlia, and Brian De Palma seems to have completely lost any ability to make remotely interesting anything anymore.To top it off, I don't know what Hollywood sees in Hilary Swank at all. First of all, are they all blind. This is not a sexy attractive woman and yet she plays a femme fatale in this.Throw in the whole Scarlett Johansson, Josh Harnett, Aaron Eckhart what is the deal with them? Are they living a polyamorous lifestyle? It's never fully revealed and I couldn't figure out if it was implied or what it had to do with anything. She's wasted in this role and she should have played the femme fatale character.Anyway, it's a complete mess and looks as flat as a made-for-TV movie.Could we put to rest any more Black Dahlia movies. Wasn't the 1975 movie Who Is The Black Dahlia starring Efrem ""FBI"" Zimbalist Jr. enough?"
1,Nothing to do with the Black Dahlia,"I first took an interest in the Black Dahlia after watching ""Hollywood's Most 20 Horrifying Murders"" on E. I then purchased this DVD out of curiosity. All I can say is- BIG MISTAKE!!! I was expectiing a biography of Elizabeth Short, along with the murder & aftermath. However, the movie only touched on this subject now & then. It made no sense to me whatsoever. All in all, I was disappointed, very disappointed in this film.After watching this film, I then threw the DVD in the garbage."
3,Confusing movie,uh... what happened in this movie. too many characters too many names. awful movie. boring.
1,Cigarette commercial,"This movie is slow, boring, and poorly acted and even worse it was a constant stream of every actor in every scene talking about and smoking CONSTANTLY!! It was so distracting that I could not even finish the movie. I mean I am pretty sure the novel did not have pages and pages of characters smoking- I realize this is a timepiece but come on- who financed this movie? Phillip Morris!!???"
3,Fact into fiction,"This movie is not what I expected...I wanted to see a film about the life of Elizabeth Short, AKA ""The Black Dahlia."" Instead, we get an imaginary tale about two detectives put on the case to solve her murder. We get insight into these two characters and their lives and not enough about the Dahlia.The good things about this film: Hilary Swank has never looked better! She definitely ain't as butch as she was in ""Million Dollar Baby"" and she exudes some EXTREME sex appeal! Wow! Also: put the true facts out of your head and focus on the film for what it is: a murder mystery...and it ain't bad when you watch it with that frame of mind.Also, you'll get some kind of closure to the crime (even though it's a fictitious outcome) by seeing who actually commits it in the last 15-20 minutes.....even though it ain't the true tale, you'll still be transfixed!Do I recommend the film? Sure...but keep in mind, it's only a FABLE about a true-life incident."
2,Faded Dahlia,"Following a thorough review of my experience watching The Black Dahlia, I have concluded that the reason this film doesn't work is: It Made Me Want To Pick My Nose More. (And secondly, it is all Mood.)..There is nothing more to be paid."
1,Bait and Switch,"First off, this movie does not concentrate on the Black Dahlia killing. Instead, it presents the story of two cops that are sort of trying to solve the killing, but are instead distracted by everything else. This is yet another crass Hollywood attempt to cash in on a name. The book ""Black Dahlia Avenger"" has been a bestseller for some time now, but this movie comes nowhere close to what the book is."
2,Just Plain Awful!,"I'm glad to see all the negative reviews concerning this film. There's hope after all for those who post their reviews here. The ""Editorial Review"" says it all concerning this film. I was 13 years old when Elizabeth Short was murdered & I was living in L.A. where it occurred. It became traumatic for me because I had met one of the apparent suspects & couldn't discuss it when the police questioned me because it involved a personal friend. The book upon which this very badly made film is only loosely based is itself only loosely based on the actual murder case - but it is much more so than this film is.The title is a misnomer. The film is actually about a fictional L.A. police investigator."
1,Just plain bad!,"I went into this movie with high expectations and was extremely disappointed. Not only do I wish I hadn't spent money to see it, I want the precious time spent watching it back. Absolutely ridiculous acting (I blame it on the director because these actors are usually very good) and the story line jumps around so much you can't even keep track of what is going on."
1,Don't waste your money and hours of your life.,This movie is total and complete rubbish. People were actually walking out. My head hurts. Don't waste your valuable time or money to torture yourself by watching this.
2,Even the Transfer Looks Dim,"The many critics of this film, both in the national press and on Amazon, are right, in spades; De Palma's picture's one of the weakest of his wildly uneven career. I'm a great fan of THE MAN WHO LAUGHS, but I defy anyone unfamiliar with that film to sort out its use in the present plot. And the dialogue's so ridiculously stilted and stuffed with bad noir pastiche jargon, it's frequently well-nigh incomprehensible. Poor, talented Fiona Shaw and the usually capable Scarlett Johansson will survive the wreck -- but please, can't we put Josh Harnett out of his (and our) misery? He's lame enough in contemporary pictures, but in period material, he's so lightweight he vanishes onscreen in a crowd of two. Reading the other pans, I'm surprised nobody's ragged on the quality of the transfer. Universal generally does well with its DVDs, but my copy of this film had a greyed tone, lacking true, deep blacks -- surely an unforgivable sin for neo-noir! What a missed opportunity."
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I've read the other reviews and they are right.I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Mostly because I expect so much more from De Palma. He has turned out such classics in the genre as 'Dressed to Kill', 'Body Double' and 'Snake Eye' that I was eager to see how he handled the case of the Black Dahlia.In the end he does pull it all together and packages it up for you. However, this movie meanders and actually avoids the subject of the murder. It became so far from the point that I was actually considering turning it off. But I kept going out of curiosity.The plot of this movie grows so many branches it becomes difficult to track so you need to pay very close attention .... even during the boring parts.This movie is based in the true story of Betty Short. Therefore liberties are limited. It would appear that works of fiction play out better for De Palma."
2,Just Plain Bad.,"Anybody expecting to get a great account of the Black Dahlia case, even fictional, will be disappointed going in to this movie. Of course, I knew that it was a fictionalization of the case, but I had no idea the movie would present its own evidence and draw its own conclusions.They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.Although the film brings a clearcut finale rather than a vague puzzle, too many loose threads come together too neatly and rather than bringing the film to a satisfactory conclusion, it leaves you scratching your head, is this what I spent the last 2 hours waiting to hear? Overall, there is too much plot, too little character development and a wildly uneven tone. The movie has its moments but it's a blinding mess all together."
3,MY REVIEW,I thought the movie took an interesting turn from the true story but would have like it more if they kept the story ending close to the true story.
1,DEPALMA ENDS HIS CAREER!,"GROWING UP WITH DEPALMA, DIGESTING HIS NEO-HITCHCOCKIAN MATRIX HAPPILY,APPROVING POSTERITY WITH HIS INCREDIBLE ABILITY BEHIND THE CAMERA, WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE SUCH RESULTS OF NOW YOU HAVE TO SAY HIS DAY IS PROBABLY GONE-HOW SAD GROPING IS! BLACK DAHLIA IS NOT REALLY WORTH THE INVESTMENT.SEE L.A. CONFIDENTIAL OF WHICH MR. DEPALMA STUDIED AS WELL TRYING TO SURPASS THAT MASTERPIECE FAILING INSTEAD. TO MUCH CALCULATION! DON ROBERTS, NEW YORK"
3,AMERICA'S CRITIC,"THIS MOVIE WAS NOT THAT BAD GUYS!!!! I GAVE THIS ONE 3 STARS AND WOULD NOT GET THIS ONE BLU RAY,,, I REALLY LIKE JOSH H ACTING HE IS GOING TO BE MAJOR JUST WAITING FOR HIS MAJOR ROLE!!! ALL IN ALL RENTER MOVIE!! RED BOX THE BLACK DAHLIA"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The Black Dahlia often looks good (some of its scenes are in fact spectacular) but it's so unbelievably over the top and convoluted that it has to be seen to beleived; a colossal waste of talent and money, the film is only recommended to those who enjoy watching cinematic train wrecks."
2,STINKY FLOWER,"Over the years I have admired the work of director Brian DePalma, even if he patterned many of his films in the shadow of Alfred Hitchcock. CARRIE, DRESSED TO KILL and BODY DOUBLE are some of my favorite thrillers. But there is little of DePalma's visionary direction in this tepid thriller. In fact, so much time is spent on the rivalry between the two detectives that little focus is actually on the murder itself. The script is contrived and puzzling; the performances are far from what you would expect: Josh Hartnett is way out of his league in the role of the heroic cop; the usually dependable Aaron Eckhart doesn't seem to want to be in the movie; Scarlett Johansson and Hilary Swank perform as if they were mimicking Lauren Bscall or Rita Hayworth. It's all dull in the long run and a missed opportunity for all involved."
1,Disappointing,"My friend has a minor talking role in this, so I downloaded it to see my friend, and because I admire some of De Palma's past work. The film displayed plenty of talent in all areas except script. I lost interest by the halfway point, and watched through the end only because of my personal connection. Plot resolution was implausible, even if it's based on fact. Characters fell apart."
4,Much better than I expected,"I am a big James McElroy fan, as well as a huge fan of the city of Los Angeles and its history so my review of this may be slightly tainted to being more positive than it should be. The plot line is intriguing all though its very easy to get lost, it is a good execution of the film noir genre by De Palma but the acting by Josh Hartnett leaves alot to be desired. I give it a B+ based mostly on the intriguing nature of the plot but they could have done much more with it than they did."
1,Extremely disappointing.,"This film should not have been titled ""The Black Dahlia"".It should have been title ""Josh Hartnett bangs everyone's girl / with brief appearances/mentionings of The unsolved murder of Elizabeth Short / aka: The Black Dahlia Murder""This film barely kept me awake and interested.I was hoping for a story based on the black dahlia murder, and what I got watching this movie was not it.This movie is more about ""the lives of the people in L.A., and the L.A.P.D. in the 40's"" ... and , seriously, the murder of Elizabeth Short is used more for a ""back-story.""As the previous reviewer noted, this movie has a poor ending.I wanted so much more out of this movie, but, I was completely let-down.Well, I guess I'll go and watch a movie where I know what to expect.Jackass 2 here I come !!!"
1,The Blah Dahlia,"Wow - I didn't know they still made movies this bad. I knew Brian De Palma's reputation had taken a beating in the last decade or so, but I really understand why now. This was easily the worst movie I had seen in a long time. And a warning for anyone who is interested in seeing this film because of the real Black Dahlia murder: ""The Black Dahlia"", the film, treats it as nothing more than a springboard and a background. The very real murder is secondary or perhaps tertiary to the silly and contrived plot, and - at least in my opinion - this film trivializes what was the brutal and gruesome death of a very real woman. I would have been embarrassed to have made a movie like this. Embarrassed, or perhaps ashamed, if we lived in a culture that could still feel shame."
1,painfully bad!,"The first thing that struck me about this movie is how forced and amatuerish the acting is in this film. this film is trying so hard to be noirish that the dialogue comes across as pretentcious and ridiculous. And whats up with scarlet johansen? this is the second film in a row that i have seen her in where her acting has been wooden and just plain bad! it looks like she has no range at all. her acting looks like something straight out of a highschool play. josh harnett is totally lost in the lead role and clearly does not have the acting chops to carry this film,and he is way too pretty to play the washed up fighter or the hard boiled cop .there is no chemistry between josh and scarlett..the other actors in this film are so over the top that its painful to watch. even the great hillary swank is lost in her portrayal. brian depalma really mutilated this film .its a mess, dont even bother watching it."
1,The Disappointing Dahlia,"For a movie with so much promise and potential, the directors, writers, and screenplay adapters could not have gone more wrong. ""The Black Dahlia"" is a piece of film-noir garbage that does nothing to advance the genre but instead defames its very name. The only redeeming component of this film can be found in its all-star cast of screen celebrities, none of which can, despite their best efforts, revive this wretched reel from its well-deserved death. The story, composition, cinematography, and execution alike all fail to meet even the lowest of expectations and instead, make for a wholly underwhelming and lamentable experience. Pass on this one and save yourself both the time and money which are rightfully yours. Dahlia is an undeserving candidate for either."
2,Another Disappointment From De Palma,"Despite his impressive visual style, Brian De Palma remains a hit-or-miss filmmaker. For every ""Dressed to Kill"" or ""The Untouchables,"" there's a half-dozen misfires such as ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" and ""Snake Eyes."" Unfortunately, ""The Black Dahlia"" (2006) belongs in the latter category. This deliriously incoherent James Ellroy adaptation suffers from flat acting and lack of narrative focus. However, the Los Angeles period detail is spot on and film buffs will enjoy the references to director Paul Leni's 1928 classic ""The Man Who Laughs."" It's a shame this watchable mess didn't work out better."
1,Waste of plastic,This is one of the worst films I have ever seen.The plot was confusing and the Black Dahlia played a VERYsmall part in the story. The main issue was the cops. Theacting was mediocre and meaningless. The plastic used tomake the DVDs would better be served making keyholders.Don't waste your time or money.
2,LORD WHAT A MESS,"Actually this movie has some good points..like Hillary Swank..although i honestly, she needs a new agent if this is the best he can do for her. As for Josh Hartlet, he ought to kiss the ground everyday for his career, because he is bar none the WORST actor in Hollywood, i think he has sold his soul to the devil, which is all fine and good, but i didnt, so why do i have to endure the torture of watching him..he and Scarlet Johansen have NO chemistry and frankly she is as bad as him in this..what is with all the stareing, what the f is she looking at?...i guess she's just so gobsmacked that she's in this film, she's gone into shock. I give this film two stars instead of none because of the great Fiona Shaw, she is worth watching this for: she is hilarious. Frankly, this film in better hands could have been watchable, but as it is, id say, dont walk away from this movie if you see it for rent...RUNNNN Forest, RUNNNNNNNNNNNN."
1,"Brings new meaning to the term ""stink-osity""...","To say this is an embarassment is way too generous. From top to bottom, this is one of the most ridiculous films I've ever seen, and I've seen quite a few. Such big names, associated with such trash - what a waste. For me, and the audience I saw this with, the bright spot was the woman who played Ramona Linscott. She was a scream, kind of a cross between Faye Dunaway in ""Mommie Dearest"" and Bette Davis in ""Baby Jane"", except not quite as subtle and restrained as either of those performances.Since the lowest possible rating here is one star, that's what I've chosen. Although some negative value would be more appropriate."
2,Big Anticipation for a Big Let down,"This movie has been hyped up ever since it was in the making, and the previews made this look like it could be one of the best movies of this year. but it wasn't. not by a longshot.This movie had me yawning and daydreaming while staring at the theater lights after about the first 20 minutes. while the 3o's-40's theme was well played through, the boredom of it was overwhelming. for the first time, i think, i was waiting to see the dead girl. it was like ""bring her on already.""it seemed more about Bucky & Kate's sexual tension and Bucky's life story than it did about the murder of Elizabeth Short.it seems more like somoene wanted to make a 30's themed movie and was like ""oh yea, how about we put something about that horrific murder of the actress in it.""don't waste your money."
2,OK...what was this?,"This will be the shortest review I have ever written. This film has little to do (AT ALL) with the Black Dahlia. It is a series of disjointed scenes that are a good depiction of L.A. in the 40's-but that's it. For sensationalistic purposes, the film maker decided to throw in the Black Dahlia case, that has but a few minutes in the whole film. It was an attempt at 'Film Noir' in color. The title and promotional material are all very, very deceptive. ""Josh Hartnett is hot"" is about the only feeling one comes away with after seeing this long film. That equals ""fail."""
2,A twisted plot is not the only problem,"The style and the camera movement of the movie is very good. However, the plot is nigh incomprehensible. The main character keeps get flashbacks and has a miracously ability to put all the pieces together with the small pieces of information. I kept thinking, ""Yes, but how in the world did he figure out where ...?"" Some mysteries like the ""Big Sleep"" can overcome incomprehensible plots, but these mysteries need a strong lead like Bogart. Unfortunately, Hartnett does not carry the film. He's ok, but he can't carry all the deadweight of the plot. Swank seems to be channeling both Bette Davis and Harlowe at the same time. Johanssen has a very strange character.The movie was disappointing."
3,Movie was ok...,"I had higher expectations for this movie, as I was expecting a little more action. Seemed a bit long and kind of lifeless."
2,The book is always better.,"In this case it's true the book IS definitely better. Much better. The book is a gripping, disturbing, page turned. The movie is just a big disappointment."
3,SCENE JUMPER,"I have no problem with the seller at all. They were great. The movie was to busy. It talked more about the 2 detectives lives than it did about the Black Dahlia. I kept waiting for the next scene and it just didnt get any better. It was ok from a movie stand point, but not informative. I have shared it with a couple friends and they loved it."
2,Confusing Plot,"A somewhat confusing plot revolving around the real Black Dahlia murder with the rest being pure fiction, onto of the murder there is police corruption, adultery, betrayl, the porn industry, the crazy wife, the seductress all in a Hollywood location"
1,A waste of time ...,"I'm not going to write a long review because, frankly, it's all been said. I went to see this movie with two friends, and we were all disappointed.Right from the start you get the feeling that you've already missed something big, and the film continues to get more and more absurd and illogical from there.There are several good actors in this film - Aaron Eckhart, Scarlett Johannsson, Josh Hartnett, Hilary Swank - but not one of them gives a decent performance here ...If you want to do yourself a favor then skip this film ... it's a waste of time, simple as that."
4,Ah the Case of the Black Dahlia,I enjoyed the storyline and script of the Video and the actors were very good in their portrail of the story.
4,Good however!!!,"If you like China Town, The 2 Jakes and Devil in a Blue Dress, Then you will probably like this movie as well. The film noir mood is the hook.No........ it isn't as good as any of the first there named above BUT they haven't made any of the above for 10 to 20 years.....and if your mouth is watering for something like the above then this may sooth your apetite.Better than LA Confidential."
1,What a waste of time and talent,"What on earth were these people thinking? The story is a dull, plodding mess; it's a good cure for insomnia and that's about it! This does not tell us anything about the murder case. It just goes into some steamy nonsense about lesbian pornos and love triangles. Stooooopid."
2,Murder of the twelfth degree,"""The Black Dahlia"" is a mess. Everything's impressive and nothing is right. It seems like Aaron Eckhart's character should be played with more darkness, like Josh Hartnett's character should be played with less boyishness, like Scarlett Johannson's character should be more emotionally complex. The story is convoluted and the storytelling is awkward. I can explain the film's core storylines, but to tie everything together is a task beyond me. There is one person involved who deserves praise: Mia Kirshner, who portrays the thin, secondary character of Elizabeth Short with surprising emotional depth. Brian De Palma's original three-hour cut supposedly was a horse of a different color. The cut with which we're presented is boring, absurd, and unpleasant."
1,Worst Ever...Seriously....,Worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. I actually got dumber during this film.
2,Tough to follow,"The locations and sets were great, but the performances?And the story, hmmm? Though to be fair, it's my understanding that a lot got cut out of the movie. I'd like to see a director's cut and see if that makes a difference, tough I doubt that will happen.Fun to watch, but see it on cable."
1,a confusing mess,"It looks like this movie is a pretentious attempt to seriously recreate a film noir genre, but it takes itself so seriously it fails miserably. As others have noted, the acting is quite bad, the script incredibly confusing, the direction misguided, and in the end when (FINALLY) the myriad plot threads attempt to come together, there are so many impossible coincidences linking the characters, you wonder that the writers had the nerve to suggest them. Amazingly, as bad as the usually brilliant Hilary Swank is here, the worst performance award must go to Fiona Shaw, an classically trained actress with an incredible pedigree. Is it possible this was supposed to be a comedy, and we all just missed it? Because I was actually embarrassed for these actors. Still, the film looks great, and the boxing match in the beginning was quite good. My advice? Once the bell rings and the match is over, switch to another movie. It's a downhill slide from there."
1,"If It Ain't Broke, Don't Fix It","What a disappointment. I bought this DVD in Target on impulse. Bad move, bad movie. While I never read the book, I did see a version of the Black Dahlia a number of years ago starring Lucy Arnaz as Elizabeth Short. It was an absorbing film, compelling, very well done. The major focus was on the mystery of who the Black Dahlia was, where she came from, trying to piece together her life in L.A. It was done in flashbacks showing Elizabeth Short in quick scenes up to the point where she was murdered.This movie rambles on for about an hour before the murder is introduced, and then the focus doesn't stay on it, but bounces around on a bunch of shallow, boring characters. It all has about as much essence as confetti flying around on a windy day. I was sorry to see Hilary Swank in such a feeble production."
2,So much going for it; dismal result...,"Despite the cast of A-List actors, the best thing about this film is the glorious noir photography of Vilmos Zsigmund. The acting is unconvincing, and the direction is sloppy, but all elements of production design are first-rate. Mark Isham's score is appropriate, but a little too much like Jerry Goldsmith's ""Chinatown"" music, especially the use of the solo trumpet. Mr. de Palma missed on this one, and his cast seemed uninterested in their material. James Ellroy can be given brilliant film adaptation (""L.A. Confidential""), but not this one. What a bummer. I was hoping for so much more. The DVD extras are more entertaining and informative than the film itself."
3,Not Bad,This wasn't a bad movie just wasn't what everyone thought it would be. It is hard to follow if you don't watch too carefully.Wish it would have been more about the Black Dahlia than this storyline.
2,"""Mr. Fire & Mr. Ice"" ~ All Smoke & No Substance","Wow, I can't believe how much I disliked this film, especially with the presence of such attractive actresses as Hilary Swank, Scarlett Johansson and Mia Kirshner. There's simply nothing entertaining or engaging about this movie. It's admittedly stylish, but so slow. Making matters worse, there's no sympathetic figure to care about.Ranging from the amoral police practices of officers Bleichert and Blanchard to the rich, perverse and disgusting Linscott family, the storyline drifts through the seedier bars and nightspots of Los Angeles circa late `40's. The only one to muster a spark of interest is Mia Kirshner in the ill-fated role of Elizabeth Short (Black Dahlia) but her part is so short and interspersed so infrequently through the film it's virtually impossible to maintain your connection with the character. I recommend you pass on this one."
1,I am just sorry that I can't give it a negative number!,"Its just a shame in that this film had a good premise on which to build upon. (1940's Los Angeles, The zoot suit riots,The LAPD, Hollywood at the height of its power and a horrific murder that has never been solved.)But instead we get this attempt at a Film Noir that just falls flat on its face. Frankly I am very disappointed, it was altogether a very confused, poorly thought out film that and the actors did a really shoddy job altogether. The only bright spot being the attention to detail for the sets."
1,Awful,"This movie s*cked. The plot was poorly developed, the acting was estranged and it could have been better. It sucked"
3,Decent compilation,"A decent compilation of some of King Jammy's better riddims over time.They prob should've started it off with Wayne Smith's 'Sleng Teng' since that's easily his most famous work. ""I Love King Selassie"" by Black Uhuru seemed a bit out of place on this CD since it's a dancehall CD and that's a straight reggae track.Overall it's a good listen and definitely recommended as one for the collection; especially because it also has the DVD documentary which allowed you to see other interesting perspectives about dancehall's most legendary producer."
2,I remember when this was popular,"There once was a day when I would have given the sickness 4 stars. But long since purchasing this, my music collection has grown considerably and I no longer consider Disturbed to be as great as I once thought of them. My despise for them probably came with my complete disappointment with Believe, that record sucked. As for the Sickness I find tracks 1-5, 10 and 11 to be listenable. Everything else is boring. The song Down with the Sickness is the heaviest song here, which was one thing that disappointed me when I first listened to it and has been featured in so many movies that its lost all meaning. Sorry kiddies, but if you want great metal, then you have to look elsewhere, Disturbed only live to disappoint. Check out bands like Malevolent Creation, Slayer, Sepultura (Old), and Vader instead for some real metal."
2,This got old fast!,"I previously gave this album four stars, but I don't know what I was thinking. I should have known I wouldn't have liked this. ""Stupify"" is okay, and ""Numb"" and ""Shout"" aren't bad either, but that's it. Unless you like nu-metal stuff like Korn and Limp Bizkit, you will not like this. (...) Not the worst of the genre, but bad just the same. Give me Iced Earth over this ANY day!"
4,THE SICKNESS !!! CLASS,"The Sickness is quite simply a great thought provoking record. I bought it after hearing the their current single 'voices' which is a truley wicked song.As well as voices other great tracks include Down with the Sickness which is the best and most 'disturbing' song on the album it;s worth the money alone. As well as this The Game and Stupify also stand out.David Draimen's voice is powerful and at the same time mellow. He can go from screaming and grunting to bein totaly chilled out . The whole band sounds good with a great use of electronics used to enhance the songs .KOOL ALBUM ...BUY IT"" i can see inside you the sickness is rising dont try to deny what you feel. It seems that all that was good has died and is decaying in me! DOWN WITH THE SICKNESS."
4,Jammin' !!,"Starts hard stays hard. good work! It start feeling a little tired by the last couple of songs, but all in all you'll be glad you got it."
3,questionable.........,"This cd i bought first just because of the awesome song down with the sickness, best song on cd, and there is voices and Shout 2000, anither really good 2 songs, but the rest of the cd is just dull, no catchy or really cool rifts, some of the songs are just plain boring if you ask me, not enuff flavor. But at least they are something fresh."
4,Pretty Good,"Well the title pretty much says it all. It is a pretty good CD. My favorite songs are voices, Stupefied, fear, The meaning of life, The Game, and Down with the sickness. I would really only reccomend this CD for people who like heavy music or bands like.............. well, theres really not a band like this one that i can think of but this is definitly a heavy CD. Take a chance and by it."
4,Breath of fresh air.,"I've had this CD since Dec 99, as a friend of mine works for a college radio station and they received one too many advance albums (of new bands that would be released the following year).Among the assortment was this group, which I never heard before. I popped the CD in and while this is not entirely my kind of music (not heavy enough) I was simply amazed at the effort and energy put in. The production, mixing, was good. The actual lyrics left a little something to be desired, but the singer's Reggae-style is kind of catchy (I do like reggae). A good rule of thumb, if you want to keep the listener interested enough in wanting to hear the next song, make it catchy. And the band succeeded in just that.An idiosyncratic mix of N17, Gravity Kills, and Incubus, which is, in the longrun, worth checking out."
2,This Album Blows,"I bought the album, the Sickness thinking that it would be really good like the album Believe. But ""the Sickness"" really reeks!The music is ok, but the lyrics are really bad.This album sucks, bottom line. I shouldn't have bought it."
4,Wow!,"I am not really into this style of music, but I was tapped to chaperone my younger cousin to Ozzfest this summer, and found myself really liking this band! The lead singer really gave his all to the audience & the whole band just put on a great show. There seems to be a great rapport, friendship & respect between all the band members which is good to see. I've heard them compared to Pantera, with sort of perjorative twist in the comparison, and I can agree in that both bands kick some serious, but there's more musicality to Disturbed, I think. The lyrics are pretty intelligent, too. I didn't find them at all derivative, but as I said, I am not a regular fan of the genre. If you ever get a chance to see these guys live, GO! You will not be disappointed."
3,"well, believe is better.","Dont get me wrong. i like disturbed. but this is my least favorite of the two cds. Believe is an album i can listen to over and over again and never get tired, but this, i just listen to when i have nothing better to do. kinda like my green day, staind, mudvayne, and some of my korn cds. My fave songs are the game, stupify, voices, shout 2000, and down with the sickness. If standard nu metal is your thing, get this cd. if you want something with awesome lyrics, get believe."
1,MORE PHONY METAL,Who are these guys think they are. There no slayer or even metallica. There lameo whiney punks who need to get a life... STOP YOUR WHINEING..... THATS NOT METAL!!!!!!!!!
1,trash,"disturbed is just another mid 90's korn/deftones ripoff band that the labels threw out there amongst a cesspool of other stagnant, tired, and generic bands all cluttering the extremely uninspired rap metal genre. this pretentious cd offers nothing new musically, and the band even has that trademark 90's bald guy as a front man. its over...realize it."
1,sick,"this is the sickest cd ever!its so sick!ya bro, this cd makes me want to go to the desert with my phat truck and go froadin!they are probably the most hard core band i have ever heard in my life.and they are so talented too.it takes alot of thought to come up with lyrics like ""get up come on get down with the sickness.ya bro!they are a true metal band.almost as good as godsmack!sick, tight, phat, off da hook!"
1,disturbed = garbage,"ok thankfully this nu-metal fad is quickly on it's way out, and disturbed should b the 1st to go. obviously the rest of the world is getting as tired of over-produced unoriginal corporate ""teen angst"" as i am (& have been for a while now)..."
3,Stabbing Korn,"I'll start off by saying, i did like this album...each song is powerful...driven by strong vocals and heavy, plodding guitars...my favorite tracks are ""The Game"" and ""Dropping Plates""...however...i feel as if i've heard this before...to me, it sounds like Disturbed stole a couple pages from the books of Korn and Stabbing Westward and kinda mashed together what they found...despite their unoriginality, which is the reason i'm only giving them three stars, i DO recomend this album to any fan of heavy metal"
3,Disturbed? or disturbing?,"The Sickness, by disturbed is one of the more popular rock bands on the market today. They have developed a wide fan base with little more than a little mtv play. Their music is good, with hard guitar, bass, and drums. The singer has an interesting voice, but he does get annoying after awhile. The more you listen to this cd, the more the lead singer sounds like a chattering monkey. While the music is good, the cd does get a little annoying. Many of the sounds begin to sound exactly the same, and they seem to mix together in one big orgy of annoyance. I would recommend this cd only if you like high-pitched squeeling mixing with hard-edged guitar."
2,"Not that great, just bizarre","I'm not a very big fan of this CD. It's extremely bizzare and the music isn't that great. There's a few good songs, but the rest is just filler. The lead singer has one of the weirdest voices in music today. My opinion: just bypass this and get something else. I don't recommend this CD.Favorite songs: Voices, Stupify, Down With The Sickness"
4,Not another Korn knock-off,"I don't own the album yet, but I listened to a friend's copy of it with the thought that this would just be another Korn, Limp, or Godsmack. I also thought that Stupify would be the best song on the disc. I was definately wrong. I got that impression after hearing God of the Mind on MTV's Return of Rock 2 compilation (but I had to hear the rest of the CD first). Disturbed has a good mix of heavy metal with electronics, especially on the first couple of tracks. Sure, a couple of songs like Violence Fetish and Down With The Sickness sound like Stupify, but a lot of that has to do with the singer's voice. I liked the songs The Game, Fear, and Stupify (of course). If you like Korn or Nine Inch Nails, Disturbed is a definate bet. Oh, and the ""explicit lyrics"" label definately applies to the track Down With The Sickness."
4,Classic,"In the sence of time frame of course. I can think of about 3000 artist whom if they stopped after the frist CD they might be considered ""better"". Disturbed falls in this catagory... This is their best, and they aren't gonna do better!"
3,3 or 4 good songs on here at best,"Ok here's the deal, this band has potential to be very good if not great because thier sound is catchy and original to an extent. I especially dig the singers rythemic fast pace style. His singing and disturbed instrumentals are meant to give an adrenaline rush that can hype up anybody unless your in coma.In spite of this, the main issue I have with this album is that a lot of the songs seem overhyped, forced, and repetitive. OF couse songs such as ""Down with the sickness, Lie, shout, God of the mind"" are the exception because those songs sound awesome.I hope these guys can polish up their sound to include more rythem rather then resorting to mindless screaming to fill a track. Disturbed does'nt need to stoop that low to be acknowledged as they are capable of so much more. Nevertheless, this is one of few good albums that have come out in this nu metal era so I would recommend it."
2,"sickness, 1.5-2 stars","this is not good stuff, really. its way overproduced and commercialized. very lacking in substance. not that they dont have potential. david draiman has a very good voice for the type of music that they do.not recommended."
2,Yuck,"I never really bought this, just got it burned from a friend. Ugh, good thing i didn't. First of all, I still like Voices and Stupify, theyre very good songs, but the rest of the songs are not only boring, but they give me a headache... He's not really rapping, more like sing-rapping. It is original, but i wouldnt really recommend this. I'm absolutely sick of Down with the Sickness by now, The cover of Shout is stupid, and the lyrics in Droppin Plates are horrendus. I'm glad I didn't spend money on This. Disturbed is better than most nu-metal garbage out there right now. Some of the other songs sound sorta cool, but I definately wont be listening to this often."
3,"Good, But Too Commercialized","Disturbed may be played by D.J.'s on radio stations, but is their music extremely bad? No. It's just overplayed by those douche bags. Thank God this isn't another Creed copycat band. ""Stupify"" is brutal and has a great opener. ""Down With The Sickness"" is OK, and ""Voices"" is a good song. ""The Game"" is fair, but was the cover for ""Shout"" by Tears For Fears necessary? Anyways, the CD gets loses a star for it being commercialized, and it loses another because this isn't the best music I've heard. I'm mainly a hardcore/metal listener. In other words, this is fair."
2,They messed this album up as much as possible,"This album has many sweet riffs, but the lead singer sounds like an ape and makes a wide range of stupid noises that screams cheeseness. Its a little embarasing to listen to this album. Worth a borrow, not a buy."
3,They have gotten better with other albums,"I have to admit, I have not been a huge Disturbed fan, beyond a few singles off their debut album (The Sickness and Voices)...I ended up getting a copy of their latest disc (10,000 fists), and really enjoyed the cuts on the album, so I figured I would give their debut album a try. The album is OK to say the best, besides the songs mentioned previously. The songs seem to be rather repetitive in sound, and tend to be rather boring at times. I have yet to listen to the bands second album, but I do enjoy the third album by the band, which from my perspective is a fine tuning of the sound, and shows a growth in songwriting. Still, if you want a good rockin album, the first album from Disturbed is a good buy."
4,great,"Disturbed's The sickness is awesome. If you liked Beleive you'll love this one. definatly worth your money. down with the sickness is my fav, and a few others. disturebed is great and worth anyone money, even first timers."
5,awsome,the first time i listened to this album i wish it was longer. every track is awsome. i can listen to this cd over and over and over again. this album makes you just want to nuts and start breaking stuff. i would recomend every one to buy this album they also are great live. the first time i saw them was OZZFEST 2003 and seeing them live was what made me go out and buy this album. i cant get enough i cant wait till there new cd comes out.
1,Typical radio-friendly fluff,"The Sickness is a very boring and uncreative album, and the band as a whole doesn't seem to function very well. I almost fell asleep listening to this actually, no kidding, THAT boring. This band is a fad and soon will fade away. The only reason Disturbed is popular is because weak-minded trendy teenyboppers will kneel to whatever receives mainstream airplay, regardless of talent or quality. This band is a fine example of the blind, consumerist society we live in. And please dont call these guys metal, they are far from it."
1,Disappointed,"I heard a lot about this album and expected too much. Personally I think the album is horrible. I don't like the vocals very much. The album would be better if the vocals were done right. I'm going to stick with the classics like Slayer, Machine Head, and Pantera. In my oppinion this album was a waste of money."
1,Warning: This music kills brain cells,"Most metal out there is pretty crappy and generic, but nu-metal takes the oh-my-God-my-IQ-is-dropping cake. If you want good metal try The Melvins, Electric Wizard, or High on Fire."
1,Disturbed=poop,"I'm sorry but I can't stand this band I tried to give them a chance and listened to both albums. I'd rather listen to William Hung (the asian dude that was rejected by american idol)even he's more intertaining! If I ever met David in person I drop something alot bigger than a plate on his ass, like a semi!"
1,pop metal [junk],"if u like listening to about 2 dowtuned power chords for 40 minutes, buy this horrible pop metal cd. i never thought poeple could be this bad at making music."
1,Enough is enough!,"Dear Disturbed,Please refrain from recording any more records.Enough people have suffered already.Your Truly,-The People of Earth."
1,Just say no,"By christ, you all really don't get it. This album is a joke - laughable, takes-itself-too-damn-seriously pomp metal. Draiman is one of the most ridiculously camp front men I have ever seen. At least with Judas Priest and Rob Halford they had the songs to back it up. Whinging pish from start to finish, and don't even get me started on that cover of 'Shout'. Do yourself a favour and spend your hard-earned on something else, like Pig Destroyer. They rule."
1,Oooh AHH AHH AHH AH!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!,"There were a lot of crappy nu-metal bands but they are in the elite category of those crappy bands. No I will not get down with the sickness, but I will laugh at the stupid chimpanzee noises, ahhh! ahhh! The only redeemable quality about this cd is a remake of a Tears for Fears classic. The rest of this cd is extremely forgettable and laughable, I just can't take these guys serious. The singers voice sounds like he violently needs to go to the bathroom. Everytime I hear disturbed I think of those hot topic parachute pants, sloppy eyeliner, and the nu-metal undercut trim and pony nob, priceless. I will recommend one good metal band to offer instead of these dweebs: The Showdown, do it!The Zapper"
1,DEZ GUYZ ROCK!!!!1,"YEAH THEIR SO LYKE HARDCORE, WHEN THEY SING ""GET DOWN WIT DA SICKNEZZ"" ITS SO AWESOME. IT MAKES ME FEEL COOL JUST KNOWING THEY THINK ITS COOL 2 B SICK!!!1 I TINK THESE GUYZ KNOW WUT REEL MUZIK IS, CUZ EVERYBUDY KNOWZ REAL MUZIK IZ ABOUT SCREAMING POINTLESSLY AND ACTING MAD AT DA WURLD!11 DIZ IZ DA PURFECT ALBUM FOR TEENAGE MALEZ BECUZ IT MAKEZ DEM FEEL HARDCORE JUZ LYKE DIZ BAND'Z CUZINS, ""SYSTUM OF A UP"", ""SLIP NOT"", ""MUDVEIN"", ND ALL DOZ OTHUR HARDCORE BANDZ!!11 DONT BOTHUR WITH DA ""SOFT"" STUFF LYKE ""LINKIN PURK"" AND ""LUMP BUZKIT"", DEY KANT MAKE GUUD SONGZ LYKE DEZ GUYZ CUZ DEY DONT SCREAM ENUFF!!11"
2,An unimpresive debut,"Inchoate, incoherent rage is the hallmark of this album. Now I like angry music and it's rare for me to dislike an album primarily based on lyrics but good god man, what did your mommy do to you that you're still singing about her as an adult man? Get some help you mysogynist pussbag. This is a third tier nu metal band and for a genre with as few decent bands as nu metal, that's pretty bad indeed. Uninspired, unoriginal, unintelligent and unbearable. This stuff is way too mainstream and kiddie for me. If you want some original metal that blows Disturbed away check out Strapping Young Lad or Zyklon or Tool or Immortal... I'd stay as far away from this commercial radio friendly garbage as possible."
2,...well...,"well, alrighty. Here we have Disturbed, it's rock. It's loud. It's ... off. It's an OK album. I can't say that Stupify is the best song on here, as a matter of fact it is my least favorite. The Game, and ummm, the last track (for the life of me I can't remember the title, and don't feel like looking it up) are my favs. is this an original band? not by any means at all. Are there worse bands out there? Plenty. Are there better? But of course. I'm not going to tell you who they are though *cough* MDFMK / KMFDM, Schwein, Slick Idiot, <pig>. *cough*, it's up to you to decide what bands you do and don't like. Is there somebody reading this review and thinking ""This is clearly not a Disturbed fan who wrote this review""? Yeah, most likely. To answer Answer: nope, I'm not, and I don't claim to be a fan either."
2,when will people learn,"when will people learn that this new brand of ""music"" is just a ploy to sell some t-shirts and posters, the singers dont even care about music anymore today.This album is the same old same old from the rap/core stuff. Basically if youve heard any of korns stuff this is basically korn with just a hint more of an edge but still its just screaming into a mic which anyone can do, so do yourself a favor and record yourself screaming a few words, and you will have the talent of this band."
4,great band,disturbed has alot to offer as a band i personally think this album could have been better not as great as believe but this was a really good start to a great band that has alot of potential favorite songs down with the sickness and the game
5,Not as refined and definitely not a knock-off,"To the person that claimed this is a ploy to sell t-shirts....you must be the type of person that would buy a t-shirt in the first place. This is not like any other type of music out there. It so easy to say this a Korn or Godsmack or Bizkit but why dont you let them be who they are.It is more techno than any of the other bands out there and it does have that angst that many of the other bands have, but there is almost a disco type feel to some of the music as weird as that sounds.I am not a Bizkit fan but I do like Korn and Godsmack and these guys have more of a Tool feel with the angst that th alternative rock is supposed to have.T-shirt boy!!! Grow up and buy the album"
5,Awesome surprise!,"Alright, at first I hated Disturbed because I don't like rap-rock. I didn't like Stupify, but it had started to grow on me about a week or so ago. Then I went to Return of the Rock with Stone Temple Pilots, Godsmack and of course...Disturbed. I went for STP and left a Disturbed fan. I bought the CD at the concert and afterwards was able to go to the tour bus and hang out with Dan (badass guitarist), Dave (badass singer), and Fuzz (badass bass player). I just listened to the CD today and it is awesome. ""Down with the Sickness"" is one of the coolest songs I've heard in a long time. Godsmack and STP also signed stuff and hung out. We hung out with Scott Weiland and sang him happy birthday and he got the whole band to sign my STP No. 4 CD because we sang him happy b-day. But anyway, buy the Sickness, it rocks."
2,"The ""Sickness"" True to Title","As hard rock goes, Disturbed produces some musically satisfactory material. Unfortunately, I part ways with this CD's lyrical obsession with violence and murder. Perhaps if I was some young punk trying to psyche myself up to pick a fight, or slaughter my parents, this CD might come in handy. I'm also sick of bands dropping the F bomb as much as they can. Seems to be an indication of intellectual shallowness and linguistic inadequacy. I suppose that if rage, violence, and over-use of profanity are sicknesses, then this CD is true to its title."
2,Disturbed Isn't Very Good,"I really enjoyed Disturbed's first hit single ""Stupify"", so I must say this album came as a dissapointment for me. A lot of people are raving about Disturbed, and I like their lead singer, but like many other nu-metal groups, their guitar player is not even marginally talented. Dan Donegan can do a catchy groove, but the guy isn't even on par Kurt Kobain in terms of playing ability. Distrurbed have a good attitude, but someone really needs to sit down with Donegan and show him how to use his instrument. I don't reccomend buying this album, as you can already hear all the best tracks on the radio. If you like Draiman's vocals, get Soil's album ""Scars"" instead."
3,Mediocre effort from a mediocre band.,"I had high expectations for Disturbed's debut, but was inevitably let down.I had the good fortune of seeing them in concert about two months before thier cd dropped and I see that their sound was considerably dumbed down in the studio.When I saw them I don't remember any of the techno sounds in their performance but the album is full of them.Their sound is some of the most groove oriented metal I've ever heard.If you're into the whole groove and so-called ""danceable"" metal then pick it up.ANY metal purists I'd advise to stay away."
2,Boring,After the first time listening to this album I didn't think it was too bad. But after the first time it became so boring and dry. The lyrics are rather dull and I don't like the way their distortion sounds. Another poor rock/metal band....
5,One word.....,amazing. This is by far my most listened to CD. I've been listening to it for over a year and am not tired of it. The band is absolutly fantastic! They are an original sound....which is coming harder and harder to find. Every song on here is great...and this includes Want and Conflict oppsoed to some peoples beliefs. Some of the best 20 bucks ive ever spent.
3,I was pleased,"Not exactly the best cd I have ever heard but still good. The best songs are ""The Game"", ""Want"", ""Stupify"", ""Meaning of Life"", and of course ""Down with the Sickness"". The band is not one of my favorites, and their cd doesn't exactly stick out as exceptional, but every once in a while it is exactly what you want/need to hear. Also, it's really kewl that Disturbed is featured in the AWESOME movie Queen of the Damned. I thought that was a big deal, especially considering some of the other bands on the soundtrack. Anyway, it was a pretty good cd."
5,One of the top 3 albums of the year!,"This is one of the best records of the year, along with Papa Roach. I'm not sure why everybody is saying that ""Droppin' Plates"" is the worst song. I particularly think it is the coolest song to listen to on the whole album. Disturbed is a great introduction to the new rap-metal era that is approaching and is a definate must in anyones collection who appreciates metal-rap bands."
5,Don't try to deny what you feel!,I looked everywhere for this album and finally found it. It took me about 1 1/2 months to get my hands on it. I have owned the cd for about 3 weeks now and I have finally gotten the strength to pull myself away from this album. I am totally amazed! They are honestly one of today's greatest bands. I will write a reveiw of all the songs on the album later. I have to go back to listening to this.
3,"NOT BAD, JUST A LITTLE... CONTRIVED.","I bought this album on a flood of recommendations: ""Dude, if you're a TOOL fan you'll love this!"" etc. It's alright, it just seems a little too formulaic. I think that the vocalist tries way too hard, and his forced growl is damn-near humorous at times. Maybe it's just me. ""Ooooh, we're absolutely crazy, I swear... listen to how angst-ridden I am."" Well, I did give it 3 stars. It's got its strong points, I think maybe I was just dissapointed after I let all the hype get to me. It's not TOOL (definitely not). It's not Korn, nor Limp Bizkit. Just seems too easy for people to make these comparisons, but at the cost of accuracy."
4,Lava Fueled Hard Rock,"Disturbed's first full-length album The Sickness is definitely something to die for in the music genre. Even though there are no turntables and Linkin Park rap vocals, Disturbed is easily classified as nu-metal with this CD. Fear, Down With The Sickness, Stupify, Shout2000, and Violence Fetish make great background music.Down With the Sickness has a bridge part that is probably one of the best bridge parts ever made. I laughed my head off when I first heard it. But, the rest of the CD is no laughing matter, not even close. It's a decent debut, even if it may contain SEVEN TRACKS with the F word, which ticks me off.Rating: 3.5 stars/5 stars"
5,Disturbed is Awesome!,"Disturbed is deffinitly an excellent CD. Every song is cool. My favorites are Voices, Down With the Sickness, Stupify, and Conflict. I didn't know if I should of purchased it at first, but I'm glad I did. David Draiman did an excellent job."
3,Not Bad....,"I was really surprised at liking this. I don't normally listen to heavy rock bands such as this but after hearing ""Stupify"" play on the radio it instantly grabbed my attention, especially when it reached the spine-tingling New Age-esqued bridge. So shortly after that I bought it with much reluctance and was shocked to actually enjoy some of the tunes. My favorites are ""Voices, The Game, Stupify, and Numb."" I also found their remake of the Tears For Fears cover for ""Shout"" rather interesting, though the original is lifetimes better.All in all this is a fairly good purchase... just a little too hard for me. But who's to say that you won't love it?"
4,Dark and Angery,"Feeling royally ticked? this is the cd for you. I enjoyed the songs that were played over the radio, like ""the sickness"" and so on, but some of the songs that didn't get much play were good also. However ""Dropping Plates"" just seems to be an attempted affirmation of how enduring the band is. If a band is any good, it need not brag.As far as the non-played songs go, I enjoyed ""Violence Fetish"" and ""Conflict"". It seems no one has mentioned track eight though, ""Want"". It's an interesting twist of a song of lust...or love, which ever term you deem most relevent. Well, that's enough jabber from me. If you need a taste of some sickness, buy the cd. But if your an anti-ozzfest band type of person, then don't bother."
3,Its OK,"""The Sickness"" is a good album, good but not great.""Stupify"" and ""Voices"" are excellent songs but ""Down With The Sickness"" got old really fast and that horrific cover of ""Shout"" is just that, a bunch of shouting and not much else! Its still a good album but not as good as ""Believe"""
3,better than believe,1)voices-5/52)the game-5/53)stupify-4/54)down with the sickness-4/55)voilence fetish-4/56)fear-3/57)numb-3/58)want-3/59)conflict-2/510)shout 2000-2/511)dropping plates-5/512)meaning of life-10/5 (best on the cd)no need to say ne more pick up this cd as soon as possible50/60
1,radio rock should just go already,"this band along with static-x, linkon park, black label society, five finger death punch, stone sour, etc. are the reason i don 't listen to the radio anymore. very boring, very tired, very predictable. save your self the time and effort put forth on these bands and go look for something else. the people who bought this album are probably the same people who caught onto hatebreed in 2003 rather than 1997, or shadows fall instead of overcast, and killswitch engage instead of blood has been shed. don't buy this and we can hope this bands stop touring and creating(more like manufacturing,or formulating)music."
3,I'm not sure about all the hype,"I bought this CD because I loved Stupify and Down With the Sickness. I have to say I'm a little dissapointed here. I'm not really a fan of nu-metal, but I try not to let cliches and misconceptions stand in the way. I always try to be open-minded when I first hear something. Well, some songs are really really cool. But there is stuff on here that I really just don't like a whole lot. The band has talent, that's for sure, there's no denying it, but I think some of it goes to waste, which is a shame. I love the singer's voice, as well. There's just something about this CD that I don't like, I just can't put my finger on it exactly. Overall, I would get this CD if you can find it for under 10 bucks or if you download it, but don't think it's gonna be as great as everyone makes it sound."
5,EXCELLENT,"This CD surprised the heck out of me. My fiance, who's a major Metallica/Tool/Danzig...fan, bought this CD and played it one day while I was there. At first I thought it was too hard for me but the second time through I LOVED IT!!!!! It truly is the most unique music to come around in a while. The music itself and the lyrics are completely unique and it kicks butt. Great lead voice too. And all this praise coming from someone who doesn't usually like hard metal... THIS BAND IS EXCELLENT"
5,The Sickness,This band has blown on to the metal scene with authority. They combine excellent vocals with powerful music. They also have combined rock and rap in a way that nobody else has tried.
3,Not bad.,"Decent debut album, but most of the tracks get boring. Their sophomore album is better.1. Voices 8/102. The Game 8/103. Stupify 8/104. Down with the Sickness 9/105. Violence Fetish 4/106. Fear 6/107. Numb 6/108. Want 4/109. Conflict 5/1010.Shout 2000 8/1011.Droppin' Plates 4/1012.Meaning of Life 5/10"
4,JUST AWESOME,"album is awesome from start to finish, band is tight and the singer is a perfect fit. lets face it if you can turn a crappy horrible george micheal or tears for fear tune (shout) into a great song what more can i say. BUY THIS CD"
5,The Sickness Has Me !,This is one of the best CD's of 2000! i would highly reccomend it to anyone who likes harder music. with a remake of Shout 2000 that blows the orignal out of the water and helped push Disturbed on to the radio. help this band keep going a buy the sicknedd now !
3,They don't disturb me.,"I've been a big fan of Disturbed since they started opening up for the Dead Boys and the New York Dolls at CBGB's back in the late '70's, but I have to say that I was mostly disapointed with this album. Sure, it has highlights like ""Down with the Sickness"" and whatnot, but overall, I have to say not cool man. Disturbed are still punk rock pioneers, so I couldn't possibly give this a bad score, but to give this album a 3, let's just say I gave their shows a 5 in that case. This is not pleasing to my earhole at all."
3,Good metal,"I must say that I have strayed a bit away from the world of metal, but Disturbed is still good music. David Draiman is one of the few nu-metal artists who actually chooses to sing. The bass and guitar are mixed very well throughout this album, and the drummer plays well. The electronics make good background music, and they contrast nicely with the bass. If you're a metal fan, or you're into hard rock, then you might like this."
4,Surprisingly good for a nu-metal debut,"I am by far no fan of the rap/metal hybrid bands that have come out from under the woodwork, and I thought Disturbed was under the same category, boy was I surprised. I had seen these guys at OzzFest last summer and I was pleasently surprised by how good these guys were. A few days later I bought the CD and I really enjoyed it a lot. Lead singer David Draiman is by far the craziest vocalist I've heard in a long time, and these guys aren't rap metal (which is another plus for me), and are by far one of the best new bands to come out in the new milennium."
3,Disturbed.....Is OK,"This cd is good....at first. I really liked it at first but the songs got really annoying after awhile. I'm not saying its a bad cd, just that there are better heavy metal bands and cds out there. Personally, I think Stupify is a great song and is probably the best song on the cd...I recommend that you should think about it first...listen to the samples amazon has and then decide"
4,Mad Davie will always be the guy who went AHH WAKAKAKAKA!!,"This album is one of the best albums i've ever heard. It wasn't the fact that it had a strange man/face/roles of skin thing on the front.....always a bonus......it was the fact that The Sickness album is brutal.....pure evil.....if you like your metal fast, hard and sic then this my friends is for you.BUY THIS ALBUM!! If only just to hear David go......AHH WAKAKAKAKAKA!!"
5,"Love to be ""Disturbed""",I bought this CD a few weeks ago and was instantly hooked! I rarely like a whole CD; usually just a song or two. But I love this entire CD and play it everyday! They are very original and really rock! This is a MUST-HAVE for fans of alt. rock who are looking for something different. I already can't wait for another release!
2,rather bland,"i had such high hopes for this album, i really did. after hearing ""stupify"" and ""voices"" i was convinced that these guys had talent. then i borrowed their album and i was seriously disappointed. ""droppin plates"" is atrocious, im sorry but its true. they seem to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do but theyve conveyed themselves quite badly by trying to seem ""kooky"" and ""original"". their singer makes far too many stupid noises and should be concentrating more on his singing abilities, which (when he gets it right) are very very good.the musicianship seems very 2 dimensional also, i often thought ""ive heard that before"" quite a few times, especially on ""Down With The Sickness"".anyway i'll stop slagging this album now and wait for them to come do a show over here, as live the music will probably sound one hell of a lot better."
5,The best,"Alright Disturbed is hard to categorize, as they're not rock, and they're not heavy metal, I've heard them called heavy rock before and I think this is an accurate description.I would say this is they're best album, its great, I dont really know what to say that hasn't already been said many times, so just pick this album up."
5,best cover band ever,one of the few albums that i love every song. brings out my creativity in my work.
2,Mediocre,"Can be catchy but, as with most nu-metal, it doesn't inspire many repeat listens, because it all sounds the same and, once the ""catchiness"" wears off, it's fairly mediocre."
1,Sick,"I think Disturbed isn't that good, actually, it ain't good. Very few songs hae some kind of a melody, which are ok, but this cd is a total piece of cr**. I don't recommend it to anyone but deep heavy fans. Thanx."
2,Not great stuff....,"'The Sickness' has a few catchy sing-a-long songs that can be found all over the radio that, I must admit, made me buy the CD (Down with the Sickness.) The rest of the songs are not great, musically or lyrically; fillers. By far the worst song I've heard in a while has to be ""Droppin Plates,"" which made me roar with laughter. However, I will not say that there are NO good songs on the CD. The one I think with the most talent would be ""Numb."" The singer can sing fairly well and the guitarits are okay, but the drummer is weak.Basically, those of you who love Limp Bizkit or Drowning Pool or think KoRn is HARD music will think this album is hard, and you may like it. But for people who enjoy awesome bands with REAL musical talent such as Mudvayne, Tool, Crossbreed, Fear Factory, and Rammstein, please don't even think about getting this CD! It is simply very WEAK. Buy Demaufacture or LD 50 instead!!!"
1,This c.d is BLA!,"I am not gonna say nothing but good things about this c.d because its a heavy metal band that made it on to MTV bussworthy. I personaly do not like this band one bit and I don't care what you MTV watchers think. They are very unorigenal. and the lead singer has a hard time comething up with good lyrics. Listen to Stupify. All he says is random things and then says ""BLA!"" after it. I just think they are nothing but a wana be slayer. Vote against me! But I'm just telling the truth and hopely you'll listen to me. Buy a TOOL album or a NIN album insted. Thank you."
1,No.,"Cacophony recorded on 12 horrific tracks. My Lord, I need some mylanta. This makes my stomach, as well as my ears very upset. Well, maybe this album could've been good if the band hadn't 1) Ripped off a few Machine Head style-riffs here and there. 2) Had a singer who could actually sing. 3) Had half-decent lyrics. 4) Wasn't as boring and generic as all the other jock-metal bands. ie - Drowning Pool, POD, and 3rd Strike. This is a sad excuse for music, I really wish some record executive would've shown an ounce of integrity and realized just what a musical atrocity this was and made it somehow impossible to be released. This is something that I wish would just go away. Where the only thing that is actually disturbing about this band, is that so many people actually think this is acceptable. For shame. Highly not recommended."
4,Good Cure for Math Atrophy,"If you've been using stat software to analyze data so long you've forgotten what it's really doing, this book may be for you. Timothy Hagle ""... lays bare the basic math underlying the leading statistical procedures of social and behavioral research."" Successive chapters review the basic concepts and equations of algebra, limits, differential calculus, multivariate functions, integral calculus and matrix algebra. The concise matrix algebra review seems easier to follow than the longer treatment of the same material in Namboodiri'sMatrix Algebra: An Introduction.The book is recommended for a quick review of basic math. The author's discussion of the importance this math has for analysis of social science data is instructive and motivating to applied researchers. The book is well-supplemented by the example calculations in the author's companion volume,Basic Math for Social Scientists: Problems and Solutions."
2,"Lucky Horses, Unlucky shopper","I purchased two of these, but later found that there are cheaper places on the internet to get these - buyer beware. I reported this to the vendor, without reward. HOWEVER, it is a beautiful statue, very heavy, very solid. The jade almost exactly matches the picture. It took a long while for the two statues to arrive. Clearly the packages were individually wrapped and encased in expanding foam - nothing broke. Beautiful gift that everyone enjoyed and have cherished since."
2,An unbiased view?,"This book is interesting -- but is most definitely not an unbiased, fair view of the Hopi - Navajo land dispute. But then Mr Brugge was employed, paid, by the Navajo. And it comes accross when he writes about the ""players"" involved.Worth reading only if you are familiar with other sources on the Hopi & Navajo or already have taken sides, pro-Navajo."
4,Excellent Quick Release Pins,Well made pins that work perfectly. The handle casting is slightly rough on one side of the T-Handle on both of the pins that i ordered but this does not effect how they work and i guess is a by-product of the casting process. Other than this very minor cosmetic point they are excellent pins an i would recommend them.
3,Ensure this is the correct type before ordering,"This bulb is exactly what the description says, a double contact bulb, not a double filament bulb, so the double contact operates one filament."
3,"Readable, but Predictable","May be a nice airplane book, but for easy chair reading, it disappoints. Lacks complexity and finesse. Characters are pathetically one diminsional."
2,"Bad Sound, Great Music","Vaughn Monroe was one of the all time great singers, the selection of songs on this CD is excellent. BUT THE SOUND IS GOSH-AWFUL. At least on 2 of the songs the sound is really bad, way over-modulated, static-y over loud type noise you get when the gain is turned up too much when recording. I wish they'd re-release all these great songs with decent sound and I'd buy it again."
2,One Sinking Ship,"For anyone wondering why David Lee Roth was finally fired, this extremely weak 1982 release is all that needs to heard.Clocking in at a scant 31 minutes and featuring five covers, this is Van Halen as cash cow with minimal effort that Roth envisioned. And in this incredible era of mega-selling albums, mega-tours and mega-parties that seemingly would last forever, the record company would not balk as long as units could be shipped and sold.The band had been in the fast lane, touring virtually non-stop since 1977 and quickly progressing from clubs/small halls to become an arena/stadium monster that was propelling the music industry, while recording a wealth of new material. Roth wanted a party-hearty band while Eddie Van Halen had his focus on the craft of making music.This ship was starting to sink, but Eddie Van Halen was able to patch up the holes in the hull before the band became a parody of itself, with Roth as the drum major."
3,Their weakest album with Roth,"Diver Down was the first album that Van Halen would record that wasn't strong all the way through. Although the album was their biggest seller since Van Halen II and contained their biggest hit single at the time in their cover of ""(Oh) Pretty Woman"", it suffered from both a lack of strong original material and its short album time of only 31 minutes.There are a few good original tracks like ""Hang 'Em High"", ""Secrets"", and ""Little Guitars"", but none of them are among their best work. The album is dominated by 5 cover songs with the best of them being ""(Oh) Pretty Woman"" and ""Where have All The Times Gone?"" The cover of ""Big Bad Bill (Is Sweet William Now) is decent with the Van Halen brothers' father Jan making a guest spot on the clarinet. The rest of the tracks such as ""Dancing In The Street"" and ""The Full Bug"" are not up to par."
1,DIVING DOWN ...,"I've got a warning for you, a naive beginner in terms of Van Halen. Probably you are aware of the ""conrtoversy"" surrounding whos is ( or was )the best singer in Van Halen. To avoid that kind of controversy, I will give you a list containg an album by each of its singers for you to avoid at all costs:* Gary Cherone - VAN HALEN III * Sammy Hagar - OU812 * Dave Lee Roth- DIVER DOWN.DIVER DOWN is a heartless product, only 29 minutes long, filled with covers, no ""chemistry"" or idendtity connecting the songs. A real waste of time and money."
1,"""GREAT OVERLOOKED VAN HALEN ALBUM??!!"""" COME ON !!!","THis is the wortst Van Halen album. 29 minutes long, filled with covers and second-rate compositions by the band. But fans are fans and forget to see how this is a product clearly released in a hurry, just to satisfy record deals with the record company. Except LITTLE GUITARS, ... . For your information, I sold my copy of this ""thing"" a few days ago."
2,For the hardcore fans,"Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe only 15 minutes of original material, this album seems more like a contractual obligation than a proper album that Van Halen would make, especially in their 80s heyday with Diamond Dave. Their covers of ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Dancing in the Streets"" are inspired, but hardly make the entire album worthy of purchase. ""Little Guitars"" is a great Van Halen song, but not considered a classic. If you are a true Van Halen nut, or a completist, by all means buy this one, but if you're casual, stick with its predecessor ""Fair Warning"" or its follow-up, the monumental ""1984""."
2,diverdown.,hearing all these rave reviews. isn't a band supposed to grow. the sound tired and worn out. no originality there. just boring.
4,highpowered in your face rock n' roll,"I have owned a copy of this album since its release date back in 1982. Although this album was thoroughly basted by the critics (as were most of their albums), it did what it was intended to do: rock the house down! Van Halen is the ultimate cover band... hands down! This album has a strong emphasis on their covers and the originals ain't half bad either. Check out ""Little Guitars"" for some of Eddie's best guitar work ever, or ""Cathederal"" for his solo licks. ""Hang 'Em High"" is still one of my all time favorites, but the covers of ""Where Have All the Good Times Gone"" and ""Dancin' in the Streets"" pay homage to the bands influences and their ability to ""VANHALENIZE"" just about anything they put their hands on. It's not their masterpiece, but it's a good album that any rock fan should possess... and every Halen fan should praise!"
2,Too Many Covers,"Diver Down is really OK. There are just too many covers!!! Ed, take more time and make more originals! The fans want to hear YOU, not Roy Orbison! Avoid this at all cost unless you MUST have it"
4,Here for a good time,"Van HalenDiver DownA very good album from 1982. The album contains several covers as well as a few originals and as such, it is sometimes brilliant and sometimes merely good. Still, this album is guaranteed to lift your mood from beginning to end, and sometimes even make you laugh. A solid Four Star album."
4,"weakest Roth era albums,,excluding the latest","this album contains some of my favorites such as little guitars, and my least favorite, dancing in the streets. I kind of think that this Album marks the point that VH went commercial."
5,"The Greatest ""Worst"" Album Ever","This album is thought of by many as VH's worst album. And they likely mean worst in the Dave era. Compared to other VH albums, it does seem a bit lacking, but then again, consider ""The Full Bug,"" ""Cathedral,"" and ""Little Guitars."" These are some of the bands best material. The real problem here is these classic tunes were presented in an overall album that lacked in the ears of its listeners.But one thing I like to do is think of the album in the context of what else was going on in Rock at the time. Remember Loverboy? How about The Cars?Like I said, Diver Down is the greatest worst album ever..."
4,taking roy orbison to a new level,nobody ever remade a song as well as vh did with pretty woman. i mean they took a great song and made it absolutely cosmic. the intro is even freakin' awesome. and the rest of the album aint bad either. right up there with vh and 1984.but wait... what can it be...?she's walking back to me
3,not a fan of this one,"I know it's cool nowadays to reflect on Diver Down, because at one time it wasn't considered a very good album, and nowadays people apparently like it for whatever reason.The abundance of cover songs is the biggest distraction. Van Halen was arguably awful at covering songs and made them significantly worse than their original versions, though at least the songs covered on Diver Down are a *tad* better than usual. The cover songs on the first two albums are quite awful though.Where's Eddie's amazing guitar technique? Oh it's there, sometimes, but it's never featured enough to satisfy anyone. Not that I was ever a fan of his guitar playing anyway. At least he was apparently responsible for inventing a radically different and innovative guitar technique. He should have taken advantage of his guitar playing while his inventive style was still new and refreshing in the early 80's, but he didn't.Just not one of Van Halen's best albums."
2,"Alot better than the other Dizzavid albums, but still sucks","There r 2 good songs on here. If you wanna find a good album by Vizzan Halen, get the third!!!! It has the singer from one of the GRIZZEATEST BANDS EVER: EXTREME! David & Sammy are DONE! You're 15 mins of fizzame are OVER, dudes! Just download the 2 good songs!"
2,"silly, absolutely silly","Hang em High, is the worst song ever produced, me and my friends listen to it, just to laugh at it. Eddy's playing is hilarious and makes me laugh."
3,"""C'mon Dave....Give me a Fu__in Break""","You call this a follow up to ""Fair Warning""? I think Ed Van Halen in an interview with Rolling Stone back in '95 said that this album really wasn't their style. Tell me about it. He was getting burnt out on Dave's fascination with disco. There are songs on here that sound good but these remakes were about to kill me. David Lee singing (Oh)Pretty Woman? Is nothing sacred? And ""Dancing in the Street""? If they wanted to do their own version of 60's songs there were plenty they could have done that would have rocked out better. How about something like ""G-L-O-R-I-A""? Hearing this after their previous material was a disappointment and a shock. I had to wait almost two more years for ""1984"" but I guess their previous four albums got me through."
4,"Good, with a lot of Covers","This is a good album, however, it has many cover tunes. Some of the tunes don't have the classic Van Halen sound. As a matter of fact, I think the sound is completely different, just listen to ""Cathedral"" ""Secrets"" and ""Dancing In The Street"". But it's a good album all in all."
5,Probably the best Van Halen album ever.,"Actually it is the best if you are not farmiliar with Van Halen because you can relate with the covers on it and get a little taste of the Van Halen ""sound"" If you are looking for a really true Van Halen soundind album go for something like Van Halen 1 or 2 or 1984. Overall it is a great album and I dont mind listening to it a few times through on a car trip!"
4,"Hey, Sinatra recorded ""Cover Tunes!""","Much maligned, but still a pretty good album, ""Diver Down"" is further evidence of how Van Halen could take a song, thanks to Eddie's wizardry, and make it their own. His otherwordly guitar gives ""Pretty Woman"" an urgency that Roy's original could not do. And ""Dancing in the Street"" seems tailor made for Diamond Dave's wackiness. Also, ""Where Have All the Good Times Gone"" is a smoking album opener, followed by the blazing ""Hang Em High."" ""Cathedral"" shows us more of Eddie's genius, and other originals like ""Secrets"" and ""Little Guitars"" are worthy additions to the VH catalog. Since this was my first VH album, it's always had a special place in my heart, but many years later, it still sounds good."
3,Schizophrenic,"I'm of two minds about this album. On the one hand it contains two great original VH tunes (The Full Bug, Little Guitars). On the other it has a bunch of cover tunes. Mind you, they're very good covers of good songs but when I buy an album I want mostly original material unless the whole album is covers. Musically, VH is as good as ever here. However, the soul of album is missing. Banging out a bunch of covers tells me the band wasn't too into making this album and just rushed one out to have something to support. That might be good business sense but it makes for a forgettable album.On the plus side, VH entered the world of non-concert music videos on this album. They did a neat video for ""(Oh) Pretty Woman."""
2,"""Diver Down"" may let you down.","Of the six albums released during Diamond Dave's stint witht the band, ""Diver Down"" is the only disappointment. This album contains too many cover tunes (though ""Pretty Woman"" and ""Dancing in the Streets"" are well done), and instrumentals for a newcomer to be impressed with. On a 12 track album there are 5 cover songs and 3 instrumentals. That leaves only 4 songs where the entire band coule potenially work their magic. And these 4 songs aren't that great. Only ""Little Guitars"" and ""The Full Bug"" truly stand out on this album, and that isn't saying much. ""Diver Down"" marks too much of a departure from the seminal ""Fair Warning"" and the outstanding ""1984"" to let someone actually believe it fell in between the two. If you are a die-hard fan, then you HAVE to get this -- otherwise, don't waste your time and money. There's good reason why no songs from this album appeared on the Greatest Hits CD."
1,DISCARDABLE,"If you have tha bad luck of owning this CD by VAN HALEN, there's still time to sell it... THis is the worst VAN HALEN album in the DAvid Lee Roth era, simple as that. Only two good songs here: LITTLE GUITARS and SECRETS. The rest is discardable."
3,Lowering their Standards,"This album is the worst of the roth era. it marked the time when Van Halen started to become a pop oriented band. It marked their first MTV video with Pretty Woman (which too is pretty cheesy!) Even if this album is the worst of DLR, all of the Van Hagar albums make this one look like a gem."
3,Not All That Great,"Of the ten Van Halen albums I have, this is probably my least favorite. Really a one-hit wonder."
2,WASTED ALBUM,"I wonder how much pressure the badn was suffering to fulffil his contracts with the record companies. Only this justifies the absurd low quality of this DIVER DOWN. Only thirty minutes of music, mostly covers, some tasteless instrumentals. It seem another band altogether. THis was their first clear failure after four great albuns."
2,every band has its down side...,"I give this album two and a half stars. Every great band must have an album that isnt as good as the rest, and Diver Down is van halen's. Not to say that this album is terrible, some of its songs are alright, but few live up to any of Van Halen's other 5 David Lee Roth Albums. If you want to buy Van Halen's albums, buy it in this order1) Van Halen (5 Stars)2) Van Halen 1984 (This is what I Call It)(5 Stars)3) Van Halen II (4 1/2 stars)4) Fair Warning (4 stars)5) Women and Children First (3 1/2 stars)6) Diver Down (2 1/2 stars)"
3,Rushed Effort!,"Before Diver Down was recorded, the band was in desparate need of a long awaited break from touring, recording and from Dave. They went none stop since 1977 without any rest. After the Fair Warning tour ended, the band recorded and released ONLY 1 song (Dancing In The Street) just to give the public a little taste, while they we're getting ready to take some much needed time off. Guess what? Dancing In The Street was an instant hit in 82 and Warner Bros pretty much ruined their vacation plans by making the band go back into studio to record a complete album asap. Diver Down was a rushed effort to catch the public's momentum of the 1 song release (which backfired the bands time off) and back on the road to support it as well. I honestly believe if they had a small break and then gone back into the studio to record, it would have had less covers and more energy. It's Eddie's least favorite recording. Still worth a purchase though."
2,Where have all the good times gone?,"This is only for die hard fans! With hindsight you might wonder if the band already had decided to break up. The songs are far from the high standard we got used to from albums like ""Van Halen I"" and Van Halen II"", but they do a great version of The Kinks ""Where have all the good times gone?"". I guess Van Halen asked themselves that question, or at least should have."
2,LESS BANG FOR YOUR BUCK,"Checking in at just over a half and hour,to call this album a rip-off would be too kind.Asking music fans to plunk down twenty bucks for a thirty minute album is not only arrogant, it just shows tat Van Halen totally sold out on this one. And what's up with all the cover songs. Not that I don't like a good cover song,but Pretty Woman(! ) PLEASE. A must have for Van Halen die hards only."
3,Could this be the one that got away...?,"For starters, the 1982 release, Diver Down, is Eddie Van Halen's least favorite record. Ouch! The cover tunes, which constitute half of the album, are no where near the original magic of 'You Really Got Me'(VH doing 'Dancing in the Street'!!??) Unfortunately, there are just as few keepers of the original material, 'The Full Bug' being the best, and 'Little Guitars' and 'Hang 'Em High' are the only points of light. Roth figured, if you do a song that's already a hit, you're half way home. Forget about it, Dave. Pass this one by if you're only a fair-weather Van Halen fan."
4,Underrated,"When this album was issued it was hated by critics and many fans as well. I guess time has proven them wrong. There's a couple of tracks that are just Roth's silly adventures and should be skipped: happy trails and big bad will. The rest of the album rocks as hard as any other Van Halen album. At the time it was issued, many people were waiting for new songs and complained about the covers. No need to complain now, you can enjoy this album knowing that it contains good covers. You get plenty of Eddie's guitar everywhere, and classics like hang them high, little guitars, full bug. You need this in your VH collection."
3,The beginning of the end.,"I'll give this 3 stars, just for the Cathedral guitar solo, Hang um High and the Pretty Woman riff. But this is no Van Halen 1. From Unchanged in 1981 to Dancing in the Street a year later kind of doesn't flow."
2,vERY BORING,"This is the typical product Van Halen's critics feed upon. It is confusing, a few covers acting as fillers, it has only 30 minutes of music. Very, very weak. Only ""LITTLE GUITARS"" is a great tune. For a real and lucid VH fan, this is on the theirs leatest fine moments."
4,Have You Caught The Full Bug Yet?,"This album marked the debut of MTV era Van Halen. Although this is clearly a marking time/tour album ,it is still a notch over the Van Hagar albums (excluding 5150).The cover versions picked are diverse and done well,including a rare Kinks cover (WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD TIMES GONE);some cool jazz(BIG BAD BILL IS SWEET WILLIAM NOW) and a slice of the Big O(OH!PRETTY WOMAN).FULL BUG is pure blues rock with a cool intro.Eddie didn't like recording this album much;this is surprising for his playing is top notch and his solos(CATHEDRAL and LITTLE GUITARS)are breathtaking. This album signalled the end of Heavy Metal for Van Halen;from now on they would be pure pop metal."
2,For the hardcore fans.,"Clocking in at 31 minutes and containing maybe 12 minutes of original Van Halen, this sounds more like a contractual obligation than an actual album Van Halen would have made, especially in their 80s heyday. Their covers of ""Dancing in the Street"" and ""Pretty Woman"" are inspired, but hardly worth the purchase of the album. If you're a completist, get it. If you're casual, get ""Fair Warning"" or ""1984"" instead."
2,Second rate album,An album less than thirty minutes long and filled with covers. It's clear VAn HALEN was simply delivering a product demanded by contract with the record company. That's the only reasonable explanation.This is the worst Dave Lee Roth's era album. Period
4,The weak link in the DLR Van Halen chain,"Made up of mostly cover tunes Van Halenized songs like ""Where have all the good times gone!"", ""Hang em High"",""Oh Pretty Woman"",""Dancing in the Street"" etc...arent bad but would have liked more group written tracks like most people. ""Little Guitars"" is probably my favorite on the album. Still a must have for the Van Halen fan!"
2,Dull,"This is a very timely idea for a teen novel, but unfortunately the writing lacks style and energy. The characters don't really come to life, and it was hard to stay interested in the story. A subplot where Georgie learns to enjoy the company of senior citizens while volunteering at a nursing home feels especially contrived."
2,The True SACD is Much Better,"This disc is largely a ripoff. It is 2-channel Stereo only. The 1812 is available in another mastering, a true multi-channel SACD and is spectacular. There is nothing comparable out there. The Gershwin is good, but.... It is worth searching for the other 1812. Skip this."
3,Content Good but Dated; Production Poor,"In large part, I agree with Dr Shepard. The book is outrageously overpriced and production is poor. But no-one seems to have updated the material into a better form. As suggested, get the book on interlibrary loan, but the diskette is a bit problematic these days! Also assuming the library's magnetic security system hasn't wiped it by now (ours have!).But that said, it's not a bad book as far as content is concerned. I've used it in classes, although not as a required text! I just hope someone will produce a cheaper, updated version with a CD! One day, when I get time....."
2,DO not buy this book!,I have ordered two of these book/CD books and both of the CD's will not play through a tune. The CD plays about 20 seconds of the tune then skips. I tried two different stereos to check. To bad as this looks like a great instruction book.
3,Skip it - buy Standing In The Shadows of Motown Instead,"There's 15 motown tunes in here. Most of them are covered in Standing in the shadows of motown. If you're a beginner who can't read this MIGHT (but only might) be a good introduction to the basslines of James Jamerson.If you're an intermediate bass player skip it, buy Standing in the Shadows of Motown instead."
1,Don't bother.,"I remember collecting these when i was a kid, and even when i was 14 i thought this was the dumbest most needless series ever written. I LOVED the Infinity Gauntlet and was excited to read this new tale of Adam Warlock, Silver Surfer, Thanos and such. So do me a favor and look at all those marvel superheros....they are all just scattered around the story adding no depth what so ever. As a matter of fact almost all of them could have been left out, its hard to sell books that way though. Better put Wolverine and Captain America on that cover, Adam Warlock doesn't ship enough units on his own. Do yourself and me a favor. Ignore this, and GOD HELP US if they ever put out ""The Infinity Crusade"" as a trade, its the only turd bigger than this train wreck. THIS is the kind of thing that killed comics in the nineties."
4,The War of the Worlds,"The limited series had a six-issue run from June to November 1992, which is bolstered in this volume by Warlock and the Infinity Watch #'s 7-10 and Marvel Comics Presents #'s 108-111.Written by Jim Starlin and illustrated by Ron Lim, the story line focuses on the ultimate villain Magus and the plot to gain power in the Marvel Universe. The first to fall are Reed Richards and Iron Man, while the battles build on Earth and in outer space. Magus seems to have the perfect plot, as evil doubles appear to doom the heroes to a bitter defeat.The plot is deftly composed and Lim's art is impressive. The series is an inventive means to have an all-star cast presented in a very unique scenario."
4,Not as good as Gauntlet but still worthwhile,The Infinity War is not as good as the Infinity Gauntlet for two main reasons The art is not as good we dont have Perez art this time and even Lim's artt is not as good with stiff looking characters in too many panels. The bringing back of the Magus was inspired but the relative lack of action a normal Starlin strength was not. It still is worth the read especially if you like Starlin and his way of doing cosmic stories. A negative with the TPB the stories are not arranged in chronological order which makes it hard t o follow
5,Rarefied,"The Borodin String Quartet do more than simple justice to their namesake's pair of quartets. In these vintage recordings they extract the pure essence of the works, offering perhaps the best performance of the No. 1 and one of the classic renditions of the No. 2. Given the changing membership of the ensemble over the years, it should perhaps be noted that the players at the time of this album's initial release were violinists Mikhail Kopelman and Andrei Abramenkov, violist Dmitri Shebalin, and cellist Valentin Berlinsky, who played as part of the quartet for over 60 years."
5,Priceless.,"Borodin requires emotion, strength, and an understanding of both joy and melancholy. Originally recorded in 1980 by MELODIYA, the musicians and the recording quality go far beyond expectations. This is truly music for the heart."
3,about this DVDfilm/movie golden balls............,"This is actually talking about ""died of human"" regarding the 'seduction' and sex of high post construction worker's daughter and he later end up been left to by himself....something like this and this film is recommended tothose whom are interested in this genre of DVDfilms/movie.Golden Balls: Huevos De OroReview by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kah"
5,Beautiful,"I love this cookware so far. The first time you use it, it can get discoloration on the inside if you use heat that's too high. But a bit of stainless/aluminum cleaner (I used Cameo) gets it shiny clean again and the problem doesn't seem to occur again. I love the stay-cool handles, and the heat distribution is wonderful. And it's lighter than my All-Clad, which I am beginning to appreciate in my old age. Also the lids fit on the handles and they can still hang from my pot rack... a feature that I'm crazy about because with my old cookware I had to store the covers separately.My biggest gripe is that I had barely finished unpacking it and noticed that it has gone down in price by $40 since I ordered it two weeks ago. I will definitely be looking into getting my moola refunded on that difference.I am uploading my own pictures. I bought this set and several other complementary pieces, and now have a set of 21 pieces. I am a happy camper. Retired the Calphalon for good."
5,Cuisinart vs Allclad,"I researched these pans for months. My sister in law has the Allclad LTD so I have something to compare the Cuisinarts to. The Allclads are a little heavier and of course about 2x more expensive but overall I am very pleased with the Multiclad Unlimited!!!! Clean up is about as easy as you can get and if it's ever tarnished or has that hazy rainbow discoloration, a little BarKeepers Friend and they look brand new. I have the money now to replace them with Allclads if I wanted but why would I??? Dollar for dollar, I love these pans. You will NOT be disappointed!!!"
1,Poor quality finish,"I got this as a wedding gift and was so excited to have high quality cookware for the first time. Then I cooked with it. The finish is far from stainless and easily scratched. It is difficult to clean, and now 2 years later the large pot that I use pretty much exclusively for boiling pasta and potatoes has spots in the bottom that have eroded. My Chefmate pots from Target are better quality than these."
4,Great set,"This is a great set of pots and pans. For most of your cooking you won't need anything else. The only thing to be careful of is that they are not non-stick so you have to know how to properly cook the food you're cooking (as in when to use butter/oil, what temperature, etc) or things will stick to them. If you're looking for a higher temp non-stick pan, add a quality cast iron skillet to this collection and you'll be set."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I've always maintained you can't do a decent job unless you have the right tools. I've put off buying decent cookware for at least 40 years. What a dummy, right?Well, I'm the one laughing now.I can't believe how great this set is. I make omelettes without any oil or spray. The sauce pans heat up quickly and, as I've read, I need less heat to cook things.All the basic pieces you need are in this set. It arrived on time (actually a day early) and in great shape. Couldn't be happier."
5,Unlimited vs Allclad by heavy user,"I have both. Using this for vacation home. About 30% thinner and lighter than allclad ltd. Conducts heat well, almost but not quite as good as ltds (easier to overcook custard ice cream base with this). Fit of lids on pots looser than I'd like. Very attractive, well made. For the price, 5 stars. Allclad is better though at more than 2x the cost."
5,Great cookware set with a lifetime warranty!,"I am by no means a professional chef, but rather an aspiring college student that is sick of eating at the cafeteria. I started out with a cheap 12 pc. set from a no-name brand and after a year, all of the nonstick is peeling off! I received this set as a gift and I couldn't be more impressed! The quality of this kit would definitely suit a pro chef at home. The heat is distributed evenly, and cleanup is a breeze. I recommend this set to anyone who is sick of cheap wannabe pans."
4,Nice Pans,"Very nice quality pans. Have only used a few times, but pans seem to wash up nicely and look great as well. Put them in the dishwasher and they seemed to do fine."
2,Everything sticks,"I used all of the great reviews to select these pans, but find that everything sticks, regardless of what we use to grease the pans. As for the clean-up... there is quite a bit of scrubbing involved, too."
5,"Great band, great tunes, great live act...","I am one of the fortunate few to have seen the Grand Street Cryers live in concert and although it is difficult for any band to recapture the enthusiasm and soul of a live show, this CD does so. Since I was introduced to GSC in August 1998, I have not been able to get their songs out of my head. I immediately purchased ""Steady on the Shaky Ground"" at that first show and have seen them 5 more times since. A more country-type version then their rock-laden self-titled second release, this CD has some awesome tunes including ""You Win Again"" which is not on the second album. I recommend this album and GSC's second release as well."
1,don't buy this,It worked great for 6 or 7 uses then the brushes stopped turning & while the bearings on each end turned freely the belt wouldn't turn them. So I emailed the company & they told me to go to a Sears repair center to get a new belt & was told to call the company which I did & they told me to go to a Sears repair center. After slamming down the phone I went out & bought a dirt devil hand vac which I should have done in the first place. Not that expensive but still a waste of time & money.
2,Doesn't last,"I was in the process of trying to find a replacement belt for this hand vacuum when I ran across the reviews and stopped to read them. Yes, it is a great vacuum as far as suction is concerned. It picked up pet hair from the stairs very efficiently. However, the vacuum gets hot very quickly. On two occasions I had to take it apart to remove the cat hair which was preventing the roller from turning and consequently making the vacuum useless. Now the belt has broken and from the reviews I have read it seems I will have quite a time finding a replacement belt.Too bad - it works well when it works - but I have only had it for about 3 months and may have to trash it."
2,Good Luck Finding Replacement Belts,This is an excellent vaccuum when it can be used. We have used our mainly for our stairs where using an upright was next to impossible. It picks up very well. We have had the belt break in it after only about three months of use. We have not been able to locate a replacement belt anywhere for it. The website for the company doesn't even offer a replacement. The manual doesn't even show it as a component. So be prepared for the same struggle that we are dealing with!!!
3,Very impressed....,"I must admit, I am very impressed with the performance of this littl vacuum. I am the the owner of two cats, and any cat owner can tell you it is a chore getting up cat hair from the carpet and furniture no matter how much you brush your pets. This little machine got up all the pet hair from my furniture and carpet, I am very please. Although there are three draw backs to the machine. It is very loud, the canister could be much bigger to hold more debris and the band for the rotating brush is very expensive from Shark and hard to find. Also when the unit get very hot is automatically shuts off and you MUST wait 45 minutes before the machine can be restarted. As for the bands you can compromise with using the band for the Little Dirt Devil, but because the temperature from the Shark gets very hot, after several usages the band from the Dirt Devil does not maintain its original elastictivity."
1,Waste of money,It overheats every few minutes. Total waste of money. You cannot even vacuum a couch in one try. It is marketed for picking up pet hair but you can go over the same spot on a couch 10 times and it still leaves it behind. If you want it for that purpose you would be better off buying a $5 Pledge pet hair sweeper.I am writing this review while waiting for my vacuum to cool so I can finish the couch. This thing is going in our next yard sale and we are going to look for something else. Save your money folks.
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this vac to use on my stairs. It worked good the first two times, but the third time I used it the belt broke for no reason. The filters weren't clogged and there wasn't any hair stuck on the roller. I called Shark and had to argue with them to send me a replacement belt at no charge. They did, but when it arrived I discovered that out of ALL my husbands hand tools we didn't have the right tool to open the darn thing. Too bad I threw the box out because now I can't return this piece of junk."
2,Worked for a month,"Although this little vacuum worked GREAT the first few times, it broke right after that. I was very disappointed because it had GREAT suction (although louder than my upright vacuum), was compact, and the attachments attached without falling off repeatedly. I am the type of person to empty the dirt canister after each vacuum job so I know that wasn't what did it in. Funny thing is when I went to return it the people in line ahead of me were also returning the same Shark!!! I clearly see an ongoing prob with this product."
2,"Great Vac for Cleaning a semi truck, belt????????","I bought this Shark vac from walmart. I'm going to have to buy another one take the belt out and return it to walmart.I tried for several weeks to find a new belt I could buy, but there are none to buy.. this practic is a last resort.. maybe if the shark company gets enough new vac's returned missing the belt they will offer a replacement belt..Also it worked great after I finally read the directions.. this thing works so good it needs to be cleaned before every use.I drive a Semi truck and having a vac that will clean my truck without emmiting dust itself is awesome..but the belt burned up too soon..."
1,"Never worked, Never will","This vaccuum cleaner did not last long at all (6 months) When the brush no longer would spin, and it had no suction, I opened the bottom of the vaccuum to find the belt broken. I called the company to find out what size belt to replace it with and I was told I couldn't replace just the belt but the whole nozzle head! $89.99 plus 12.95 shipping and handling. I will never buy this product again, I feel I was ripped off!"
2,Would be fine if it were only $20.00.,Unit works fine out of the box. It needs to be cleaned after each use. It is very noisy and runs very hot. The unit will cut off do to overheating if it is not kept clean or if you run it to long. I have found that it really does not work as well as I had hoped. I use it in my RV.
1,Not what I thought !!!!!!,I had a little hand held dirt devil vac and seen this shark one. Somewhat cheaper so I thought i would give it a try. What can I say it's a peice of crap. would never own another one. Sometimes I don't even make it down my stairs and it shuts off due to overheating. It overheats just about everytime I use it. Doesn't pick up very well either. Will definitely pay alittle more for the dirt devil by far the best.
1,returned it,"I just bought this little vac yesterday from WM. It's quite loud - SOUNDS like it should be a good vac. However, I bought it to clean up kitty litter that has been kicked out of the box onto tile. It does not suck up that much litter, in fact, the brush kicks the litter all over the place I have just vacuumed. It takes longer than using a brush and dust pan. I used it twice and am now returning it."
4,Wish I could find a replacement filter,"I've owned this vacuum for over 5 years with no problems. It is loud, like people say. I've never had a belt break. I clean the canister and filter parts each time. The reason for my 4 stars is because I would like to buy a new filter and cannot find one. I'm thinking of buying an entirely new vacuum just for the filter! I like the vacuum! I just wish they were still making parts for it."
1,Belts impossible to find and install,"For a vacuum that works well when it's working, I am incensed that I have spent the same amount of money replacing belts as I did on the vacuum. The belts are IMPOSSIBLE to find, cost a fortune and you have to practically take the whole machine apart to install one. Nothing in the directions or website even address the subject of belt replacement. At this point, it is going to the thrift store for someone else to agonize over and I'm going to bite the bullet and buy something else. Any suggestions?"
1,Terrible vacuum,"I bought this vacuum for small cleanups around the house.Initially I thought it was ok and used it for a couple of months. My mistake, I should have returned it right away. It is loud, gets hot quickly and does a poor job picking anything-up.I called customer support, waited on hold for along time, when I did speak to them they were not any help, all they did was ask for my name, number and S/N of the vacuum. When I put the phone down for 30 seconds to get the information they hung-up.I've since given-up and threw the vacuum in the recycle bin, that's all it's good for."
1,Overheats after 5 minutes of use -DO NOT BUY THIS HAND VAC,"Bought this hand vacuum and initially was very please with it's performance, however it shut it self off the first time I used it after 15 minutes, because of ""overheating"". So OK I'll wait 45 minutes, clean out the filters and try again. 5 minutes later, it turns off. After a week of trying to use this thing a gave up a called Shark. So, after spending a half hour getting to customer service, gave them my name, and phone number so they could set up an account for me, they tell me to send the vac to them. I mention postage and they tell me it's not refundable. What's the point. The product should not have to be returned to work right. This is the second Shark hand vac product I have purchased. IT was cordless and the battery was dead after 10 minutes of use. I took it back. I will never purchase another Shark product again. I suggest anyone thinking about buying this or any other Shark product, DO NOT BUT IT."
2,Shark Junk,I should have searched this product out BEFORE purchase. Bought this for one purpose. Cleaning a flight of stairs that is hard to do with full size vac. I was able to clean just 2 stairs.. then the belt breaks. I am taking it back and getting a refund. Many folks have commented on the same problem and no place to get replacement belts? Come on guys... I will find another brand
2,Good & Bad,"It works great, but the filter is so difficult to clean & reassemble it hardly seems worth the trouble. It cloggs easily and often so it overheats and shuts off. We bought 5 for our cleaning service. Would not want another one."
1,Shark sinks,"With two dogs who sleep on the upstairs steps, the stairs need a lot of vacuuming.My wife purchased the Shark V1510 vacuum with hope that it would help make that chore easier than using our upright.It failed miserably.It fills up too fast, it clogs too easily, it heats up when it's clogged and then stops running.It doesn't seem to have enough suction to vacuum much anyway.The attachment doesn't work very well and when you try to flip the lid over the brush to get more suction for the attachment, the lid usually comes off the vacuum.Also the flexible hose is way too strong.The unit is always being pulled by that hose so you have to hold the unit and the attachment in order to use it.That can be dangerous when working on stairs.Great price, nice looks but that's about it.I've delegated it to the garage.Maybe it'll be enough to use on the carpets in the cars."
1,Was able to clean the stairs with it twice before it burned up,This product has a serious design flaw. When we first vacuumed the stairs with it it made it down the first set before it got so warm that I turned it off for a while. After an hour or two I went back and did the last half. About a week later I did it again but this time tried to just straight shoot it. Not my best idea..... After 10 stairs it turned off and became a giant paper weight. This is not a product that I would recommend purchasing unless the place has a very good return policy because you will have to exchange it.Our second one lasted just about as long so we ended up switching brands to something that has a little less suction but has longer then a 10 min life span.
1,Way too big...,These earrings are way bigger than you would think they are. I don't see how they expect ANYONE to wear these!
2,There are better,"The book is so so, there are better versions of the same style out there. I was a little disappointed in it."
2,Book is a rehash of Content on website,"I guess that the value proposition is to have a nicely bound copy of the content currently on the Bain site. I think that it has some value as a quick and dirty reference material when trying to write cogent para or two on some faddish management trend.However, I would recommend that for most purposes bookmark to the online content would do just as well and perhaps this is something that one would give to their dilbertesque boss for a holiday present - void of any contention.Having said that - the references for in-depth discussion for each ""tool"" or concept are useful although some of these (esp in the realm of options pricing) are a bit dated.-> Bottom-line: If one has an expense account, buy it, for the rest, prod around Bain's site and bookmark the material."
3,Inexpensive electronics usually come at an extra cost.,"I just bought this DVD player, and right out of the box it does what it claims to do. It's a simple unit, made for no frills use. I partly wanted this as a replacement for our old Philips DVD player of 7 years (which continues to work fine despite my past issues with other Philips electronics). But the main reason for buying this is to use it with my stereo system (by the TV, also) to play MP3-coded CD's. Overall, for the price, this was a fair purchase. Here's why:Pro's:-low cost-excellent sound quality of audio and MP3 discs-mulitple sound and video settings to choose from-simple operation and set up-easy navigation of features-slim designCon's:-narrow remote range; must point remote deliberately and carefully-slow response time between operations (selecting chapters, etc.)-lack of sync between audio and video-no tray-open control from remote (negligible complaint, really)"
1,"Worked good for 1 month, then died","I had high hopes for this player, and it worked fine FOR ONE MONTH, and now it can't read any discs, it just says ""NO DISC"" all the time. It doesn't even spin the disc up. Sure it's under warranty but now I have to hassle with all that. Shipping it to the repair center will cost more than the stupid thing is worth..."
2,Door Open/Close Problems; Goofy Work-around,"Good news: Player plays everything it's suppose to.Bad News: The remote does not have an ""Open/Close"" button and you must be close to the player and at just the right angle for the remote to work. When I first got it, it wouldn't open, unless you pressed the ""off/on"" button first. Then you pressed the ""open/close"" button on the player and wait an eternity for it to open. Now, the only way to get the door to open is to use the remote and hold the ""Stop"" button for several seconds and the only way to get the door to close is to use the remote and press the ""Play"" button and the door instantly closes and plays the media. Very touchy player and the method I now use to open and close the door ""ain't"" something I learned from Philips! It will be a long time before I buy another Philips ""anything""!"
3,Region 2 delivers disappointing results,"I was looking for a DVD player that would play PAL video and region 2 DVD. This player was billed as the solution. While it does play PAL video (which, by the way, requires a PAL-compatible TV), it balks when it comes time to play a region 2 DVD. All I get is a ""region error"" message. So...I still have to rip and burn my region 2 discs as ""region free"" before they'll play, though the good news is that I don't have to lose any resolution (or a considerable block of time) from NTSC conversions."
2,poor,"I read reviews that this will play anything. I had to insert DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW several times in order for it to even recognize. Once it does, it plays ok. The loading process can take a long time for burned discs. Will recognize retail DVD movies without problems."
1,not easy to use,"The remote is not easy to use - the buttons only work intermittently and then only if pressed exactly straight down, within inches of the DVD player"
2,Multi region dvd player,"The cheapest DVD player I could find that plays DVDs from any region - it looks good, but the remote is so bad it hardly works, which is a problem when there are next to no controls on the DVD player itself. I think I would spend the extra money to get another player with a remote that works."
3,the machine didn't do what I wanted,I purchased the machine to play some Italian DVDs I havereceived. The machine was advertised to play region free.But it will not play the PAL format DVDs.There is supposed to be a way to go to menu preferences and code in the region. I could not find any preferences item in the menu. I returned the item the next day and received full credit.
5,GREAT PRODUCT,"HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE TO PLAY REGION 2 DVD ON IT YET, BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE PLAYED, IT IS A GREAT DVD PLAYER."
1,missing fast forward control!,"i like to record tv shows and FF thru commercials. Unbelievably, this unit can't do that. I took it back immediately. (Most DVDs I like to FF occasionally.) A player that can't FF is like a car w/o accelerator, IMO."
2,Frustrating,I would suggest that you do not purchase this product. I am sure you can find a better DVD player that is less aggravating. When you try to open to insert or to remove the disk it is very slow to open. The remote is very slow to respond and I have replaced the batteries so that is not the issue. I purchased this due to the good reviews but for the cheap price you get what you pay for. I will say the picture is good but for the most part I am not pleased.
2,"I think I got a return..should be one star, not 2 (wouldn't let me change it)","The player played 1(one) region II DVD, then would not play that same DVD (region II) or any other region II DVD. Spent hours trying to get it to play again, thouroughly read manual and all settings on high def TV and player were set appropriately. I noticed the lip of the loading tray was discolored. This player may have been a return which checked out fine maybe has an intermittent fault, but was sold as new. I'm not happy about this. Be careful"
4,Old guy review,"Just thought I'd add something as an ""old guy"" who finds a lot of tech stuff pretty scary. I was really hesitant to buy this because I needed something that would play my Region 2 DVDs. but this wasn't ready to play them out of the box. I've always had bad luck when I had to do anything to make something ""work"", but in this case I just followed the instructions that some kind soul laid out in the first review of this product, and I had no problems whatsoever turning this into a mutiformat player, that plays everything I've tried to play from Region 2.The only reason I took one star away is because it really does have a terrible remote. Other than that I'm very happy with this (especially for the price)."
2,"All Region, but skips","While this DVD player is indeed all region (after entering the code in the preference menu) it is still an inconsistent player. I immediately had problems with skipping and freezing during play back. The remote only works when pointed directly at the player and within about 6 feet. The reviews posted by others lead me to believe that while this DVD player has potential to be great, it is all about whether you're one of the lucky who receives one without glitches. Philips has done something wrong with this player. Too many cheap parts perhaps?"
3,PHILIPS DVD PLAYER,This dvd player is good and easy to handle.. but the only think i dont like is that the dvd does not have a memory to play where the dvd left off... but everything else I dont complaint about..
1,Dont waste your money.,All of the 1 star reviews are correct. This DVD player worked fine for 4 months and stopped reading discs. Find another DVD player that can play multiple regions.
4,Good except Weak Remote,Plays anything- i like except for the remote which works only up really close.Maybe new batteries - the ones that came with are exceptionally cheap.
5,Excellent multi-region player for its price,"You could buy a hacked unit or do it yourself by entering the code listed in other reviews. I've owned two of these for the past three to four years and they're still going strong; they were 50 bucks a pop! So that was cheap then when you consider a hacked unit will cost twice that. I'm a video collector, so having access to all regions is de rigueur for me. This one will play NTSC, PAL, and all regions once you enter the code. The cool part is that if you unplug the unit, it'll still recall the code, so you won't have to enter it again. One major downside to this unit - well, two - is that it's a bare-bones unit with little functions outside of playing, fast forwarding, rewinding, and freezing, and the other is its crappy remote. Once you get used to the crappy remote, it'll be fine. It's way more important to have access to every DVD you want."
2,Works great but only for about one year,"Like many other people have said, it works great but for a short time only. I raved about this at first but then it just stopped reading any discs. I did some research on the internet and my opinion of Phillips has changed. It seems this was only a prototype and therefore not produced for long term use. I am now trying the Toshiba multi region dvd player."
4,"Very Nice DVD player, Plus it plays DIVX","I've had mine for over a year now. While I don't watch a lot of DVD's or DIVX I have had no problems so far. The DIVX player works very well, but the search/fast forward feature while doing so is not the greatest.For the money I am very pleased with both it's performance, features and video/sound quality."
1,Not long-lived,"I've had this dvd player about 16 months now. I was very impressed with the picture quality and ease of use when it worked, but now it randomly opens, stops and plays on its own. I can't watch movies on it anymore since it opens by itself every 30 seconds or so. A real disappointment!"
1,Awful DVD player - failed after 5 months,"Spent a little more to get what I *thought* was decent quality from Philips, but it failed after 5 months (2 months out of warranty). An e-mail to the company yielded repair/replacement options that cost more than buying a new player. It suddenly started giving ""NO DISC"" readings upon inserting a disc. Tried resetting it and shaking it :) to no avail.Apart from the failure, the remote control and buttons are very small (and you have to be pointing right at it), and there are few buttons on the unit itself, making it difficult to do anything without the remote handy.Look elsewhere and spend a few more $$ to get a reliable player! Read a lot of good reviews (and very few ""dead after 6 months"" reviews) for:http://www.amazon.com/Sony-DVP-NS710H-1080p-Upscaling-Player/dp/B001URY8CI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top"
4,Does what it claims to do,"I have seen this slim player in several homes, and I am glad we bought one for our own house.It functions well, the DVDs slip in perfectly, and there is no skipping, jarring unless it's the DVD itself.We watch a lot of movies so this gets used a lot. We've had this for a year, and have seen no problems. We haven't really used all its functions but we're happy with what it does for us."
4,Good overall but short range remote control,"Very simple to operate, the particular one I received played DVDs from other regions with no need to ""recode"", as many other posts suggested, not sure if it is a newer firmware or it's that this is a recycled machine.I didn't use it to play divx movies yet, but other reviewers seemed to have no issues there.My main issue with it so far has been that the remote control range is pathetic, you have to be within a very few feet, and directing the remote heads-on for it to work. Also, in order to resume play from a previous point you will have to press play during the few seconds when the DVD is being read otherwise you'll loose that chance.Recommended for the price and ability to play practically region-free."
4,This is a DEFINETE BUY - just beware,"This is an AWESOME DVD player until it broke one month after buying it. I sware it plays anything!!! It plays avi, mpg, mpeg, literally everything - its AWESOME. Now, it did break after 1 month, but I called Phillips and they sent me a brand new one in 2 weeks. So if you buy this machine - which I highly suggest, just save the box and the phone number to phillips and they will give you a new one when and if it breaks. Did I say this DVD player is awesome"
1,Doesn't read *anything* anymore,"Worked great at first. Read all my computer files, region 1 & 2 dvds, and even the remote worked. Then, not all dvds would read or I would have to open and close the drawer several times before it would work. Now, 6 months later, nothing reads. I had to bring out the 10 year old dvd player again in order to watch anything. Don't buy!"
3,I enjoyed very much - may not be for the common user,"The dvd play er has several flaws that make it not so usable for many users - including that it doesn't remember where you left off when it turns off, doesn't turn on when any button is pushed (you must press the Power button instead of just pressing Open), it turns off after the DVD player is left alone for about 15 mins - then has to start the movie over, somewhat poor remote receptivity.However for an AVI/download fan this DVD player was great because it made all my DVDs with movies all the more valuable. A more ideal setup might be a DVD player with a USB hookup attached to a 500GB hard drive that stores all your movies... :)"
2,"Nice price, good picture, multi-region, but frustrating otherwise","As someone had noted previously, it is possible through the remote to switch this player into multi-region mode, and that's quite nice. The picture is also nice. However, the remote control reception is maddeningly poor; it's very iffy even from 6 feet away. Tried new batteries, a universal remote, still not good. The other problem is that it doesn't remember where you left off on a DVD, or forgets once it goes on standby. Once its on standby, you seem to have to turn it on from the front panel. I'll go back to Sonys, which have fine remotes, which remember the positions of your last six disks.One star for the picture and price, and one star for the multi-region feature."
1,Hypersensitive poor product,"I bought this DVD player for it's multi region capabilities and after reading the many positive reviews for this player. I find the player to be absolutely awful. As expereinced by one other reviewer, I can't watch ANY of my DVDs on this player. Most of the time I wait 5 minutes for it load, only to have it lock up. The remote is also very poor, as explained by other reviewers. I will have to look for something else...this player is just no good. I only give it one star as that is the least possible...I'd give it none if I could."
2,Worst DVD Player I have ever owned!,"This DVD Player looked good online and the reviews at the time were not that bad so I purchased it; however, I can tell you that this is the worst item I have purchased online! This system does not allow you to fast forward/rewind; it only lets you jump from scene to scene. It was manufactured very cheaply; its remote control is a joke. I am so disappointed!"
2,No HDMI ????,"This appears to be a well-made unit, with many excellent features save one (which is the kiss of death for any ""current"" DVD player): IT HAS NO HDMI OUTPUT.What this means, of course, is that it cannot be attached to any modern HDMI LCTV with the ""single"" HDMI cable and must be connected with the bundle of composite cables - YUK.One other note: the supplied IR remote control, while well-designed from an ergonomic perspective, would only connect with the player when DIRECTLY pointed (as in ""exactly"") the player unit. Not handy in larger rooms or when the player is in a slightly off-side location.But the lack of HDMI is the deal-killer with this one. Ouch!"
1,Don't do it,"I bought the machine to play region 2 DVD's. I had two. It played one fine; it would not play the other at all. I had the machine for about a week before it would no longer play in color, nor would it display subtitles. I contacted Philips, and was essentially told to go play in the traffic. I returned the machine to Amazon (which has an amazingly generous return policy: enough so, that I feel that I can buy with complete confidence from the company, even finicky electrical products), and bought a Pioneer machine for not much more than the cost of the Philips. The Pioneer works great, playing both Finnish made DVD's perfectly. Think twice and read all the reviews you can get your hands on before buying a Philips product."
1,very bad dvd,"this is a very bad product, the remote does not work unless you are next to the dvd, it takes forever to act once you send the remote order. It is slow in every aspect. I dont recommend it, I was too lazy to returned but i should have returned it"
2,DVD Player Itself is Good. The Remote Isn't.,"I purchased this DVD player (Philips DVP5140) about 3 weeks ago. It plays everything I put in it just fine. But the remote control's range seems to be about 3 feet! I've tried everything, including replacing the remote's batteries with brand new Energizers but nothing helps. I'm returning it today."
4,DVD,"IT WORKS GREAT.I HAD SOME DVDS THAT WOULDN`T PLAY ON MY OTHER DVD PLAYER,BUT THEY ALL WORK ON THIS PLAYER........"
4,"Good product, terrible tech support","This product supports many protocals (e.g. Xvid) and works well. But when the first video I tried didn't start with the ""play"" command, I called for tech support. First I was told that the player didn't support the -RW disk I was using (which I later found to be incorrect). So I went out and bought +RW disks as the tech recommended, and this didn't work either. So I called tech support again, and this time they told me that the avi file I was trying to pay needed to be converted to a file that ended in xvid (also incorrect). I finally figured out that I needed to open a folder on the disk and navigate to highlight the file before hitting the Play button. This should have been mentioned in the user's manual. But worst of all, the degree of basic understanding of the product by both of the tech support people I spoke to was pathetic."
3,"Works, but with some annoying lack of features","It appears the Philips is the only brand that you can still buy that is easily switchable to a non-region encoded format. We had previously purchased another Philips model DVD player about a year ago, and it died unexpectedly. I bought this model to replace it, and while it does play european discs, it does not remember where you were in a disc when you stop it, which is highly annoying - you have to go back and watch the intro crap over and over again. It also takes a ridiculous amount of time to power up and open the tray, and to save power, it shuts itself off after a very short period of inactivity. The picture quality is fine, and all other features are decent. We'll see if it lasts longer than the last one."
3,Doesn't support GMC coded .avi,"Just bought this and first .avi cd I played received a message: doesn't support GMC files. Looked that up and is .avi that is coded with General Motion Compensation.If there is a way around this, I'd like to know because I'm very disappointed."
5,So far so good,"By following easy instructions, was able to play discs from all regions and play PAL format DVDs. Without this player, I was not able to do either.Was told that DVP5140 is the only model that can do this, so just make sure you get the right model."
5,Phillips Multi format DVD player,We liked the DVD player so much that we are ordering several more for our art gallery.
1,"I know it's cheap, but it acts cheap too!","The product plays the specified formats -but shouldn't it?Some of the most basic demands from a DVD player, such as the functional operations completely fall short. The remote, first of all, basically does not work. I might push a button ten times before I apply the right pressure in order for it to actually work. Al Bundy had better technology. Every function is slow. So slow that I wait for the DVD player to think for several seconds before the input goes through.I encourage you to reject bad products and encourage companies that make good products."
1,Lousy,"The first two DVDs that I played worked fine but with the next two I got multiple errors, pauses and stuttering. All four of these DVDs were brand new. I had my old DVD player for 5 years and the only time it ever skipped was when I would get a dirty DVD from Netflix. I'm returning this tomorrow."
4,Great Player Except for the Remote,"I already had a dvd player I like alot and simply bought this one to play xvid/divx video files people gave to me. It plays them flawlessly. Prior to this I had to hook up my laptop to the TV which was cumbersome. This relieved me of the hassel, so I'm very happy about it.Now for the remote. It's small, made of cheap plastic and acts quirky. The buttons do not always do what I expect. It also has no range. Unless I am holding it just perfectly less that three feet in front, the unit doesn't respond. This is really annoying when trying to access the extra features on a DVD."
3,"Nice DVD, bad remote","Ordered this dvd player for my grandma's birthday. Player itself looks really nice and is really light weight. She has a 32"" LCD TV and the picture quality of DVDs looks really good on her TV. And the hack to set remove the region code on DVDs also worked perfectly! The only bad thing about this player is that the remote it comes with does not work at all unless you are literally 2"" away from the dvd player with the remote pointing directly at the sensor. I haven't seen anybody else mention this problem in their reviews, though it's something that's really annoying and worth mentioning. While the price was great (about $55 shipped and gift wrapped) and the picture quality is good, I will probably be either exchanging this for a new one to see if that remote is the same way, or just getting a different model."
4,Great DVD player; plays everything!,What else to say? It plays everything you throw at it. Can also be made region free with little effort; just a simple web search. I dislike the remote as it doesn't work well at any long distance. The player could also be a little bit faster in response to commands but what do you expect for the $ ?
1,At least my remote works.,"I saw a couple reviews were people were saying that they were having problems with their remotes. Mine works just fine. However, the player itself really stinks. It seems to have a very difficult time reading disks, not just cdr's, but brand new dvd's. I have to open and close the dvd tray several times, power off and on the player before it will even read the disc. It will load for about 2-5 minutes and tell me ""no disc"" or ""unknown"". It is very frustrating. I am very disappointed with this product."
1,Faulty electrical system,"It worked well for exactly a week. One minute it was fine, and the next minute it wouldn't turn on. The only way I could get it to turn on after that was to hold the unit upside down!"
4,great value,"this dvd player can play DivX, Avi, Wma formats, and so on.if you want to watch those files on tv, this is the right one.however, if you have new 2007 formats, sometime it can't read."
1,"Works for a while, then breaks and won't load discs anymore","I bought this after reading all of the five star reviews saying it was great for playing international disks. It worked fairly well for the price for one year and six days. Now it won't load 60% of my disks and just says ""No disk"". I've read about this same problem in several of the 'one star' reviews for this player. So after reading the 'one star' reviews, you can tell there is a reliability problem where these players tend to fail in the first few months. So now that mine isn't working, I'm putting it out in the dump and giving it a one star review."
2,slow and cumbersome,"This DVD player is - oddly enough - a step down from the one I bought for $30 in 2003. It is slow to load, slower to eject, the remote control barely works, and it is all in all unresponsive. It does play DVDs nicely, but it has to be coerced."
1,Nondurable,"This unit does look slick and affordable but mine worked for only 15 months; please notice that it died after the warranty expired. While it worked it was ok. I did not like the remote since it did not react timely or I had to push hard on the buttons. Further, I did not like that the titles of files played showed only first half a dozen characters and there is nowhere in the preferences to change it.And yes, no amount of hack will fix it, it is simply broken. Upon loading (after a long time of strange noises) it shows NO DISC and does not read DVDs nor CDs. Cleaning the head did not work either. I am very disappointed.Pro: - slim and it looks slickCons: - dies after 15 months- remote sucks- titles are cut off (only certain amount of characters is displayed)"
4,Good DVD player for multi region DVD viewing,"This is a good DVD player. Once you program it to play all regions, it works quite well. An earlier reviewer has posted the instructions on how to program it. I have only played Region 1 and Region 2 on this DVD player so I don't know how it works with other regions. The only real downside to the DVD player is that the remote doesn't have an eject/open button or volume control. Overall though, it is a quality DVD player that plays DVDs from multiple regions."
5,The trick works!,"Yes, the trick by H.A. Emet does work.I can see all of my Japanese DVD now:)If you coulsn't get it work, you reallyneed to try it again!Thanks H. A. Emet."
1,Not a good buy,"A low cost, but not the lowest. It doesn't play WMA files at all as specified, no matter what bit rate is. Dispointed. Othe functions tested seem OK. I don't recommend this product>"
2,Not my favorite.,This is a very quirky DVD player. Very slow to respond to opening the drawer to change media. Does not display repeat information. Seems to play all media without a hitch but not all that user friendly.
3,Average Product,"Remote Control is pretty bad...overall product is good...not so much sophesticated as You would expect, but given the price of it..its OK !!"
2,Calling this product multi-region?,"only the name is MULTI-REGION, then why can't this productcan't play anything from Region 3?the multi- region don't go with this product.Just a dvd player from a labtop.and that's it."
1,Wrong DVD sent and they say that the wanted DVD is sold out,"I ordered a multi region DVD so I can view all my films from Denmark. They have offered that I could return it but I just want the right DVD. I also discarded the package it was sent in. The Philips CVP5140 is supposed to be multi region but they say that the model I received was missing 3 digits after the model name. And that the model I wanted had different digits after the model number. I am just so tired of this that I am probably never going to order ANY electronics from Amazon out of fear that there is some invisible digits following the model number and therefor will not work. I have been a loyal customer for many years but feel that since Amazon involve vendors that are not living up to what they promise, I have to go back to local stores where I test the merchandise and check the DVDs upon purchase.SincerelySteen Lauridsen"
4,DVD review,"Overall good. Very slim and light, as advertised. Easy to hook up. Only downside is that it doesn't have a coaxial cable jack. I don't know if this is typical now though. To run cable tv thru DVD to tv. Versus cable box or VCR. Good deal !!!"
2,Reviews weren't accurate,"I spent an hour researching region free DVD players- apparently I should have looked further. This unit would take forever to load the CD, and other times it would tell us it was the wrong region and not play at all. Fortunately, Amazon has a great return program and we printed out a postage paid return and back it went.After further research, we bought a Pioneer. I learned that there are a numbr of ways to make a DVD player region free. 1) A software hack, or 2) a chip replacement. The software hack works most of the time, but will never be totally consistant , where the chip replacement is a real ""fix"" that will work indefinately.Spend a few bucks more and get a better DVD player. Thank you Amazon for making this transaction easy."
3,Works fine but nothing special,This DVD player serves its purpose but wouldn't recommend it if you are looking for something with quick response.
4,Good for the price,"The only problem I have with this DVD player is that it takes a long time to process a command. It takes a few seconds to turn on, a few seconds to open the tray, and a long time to load the DVD."
4,Nice little DVD player,Works fine - nothing special. No eject button is a bit odd. It's a bit sluggish to respond. Plays all right.
5,Philips DVP5140 player,"Fantastic player-exactly what I was looking for-I get alot of discs from all over-UK, Italy, Spain, Poland, etc-everything played great-no skips, jitters, just solid quality. No decoding necessary either. I went through a Cyberhome, and 2 TruTechs-they play all regions, but they are junk and the drawers didn't open after a couple of months-this Philips is solid and I like it alot-I highly recommend it to all who are interested in playing all regions. Only drawback (not really) is the remote you can not fast scan. CORRECTION: The remote DOES FAST SCAN!!! Even better-NO DRAWBACKS!! Other than that +10 out of 10."
1,Don't spend extra money on a free hack,"1. Turn on the unit2. Open the loading tray3. Press the ""Setup"" button on the remote4. Navigate to the ""Preferences"" page using the right arrow key5. Enter 1389316. You will now see the current region code displayed7. Use the Up/Down arrow keys to select the region required or ""0"" for all regions8. Press the ""Play"" button on the remoteThat's it."
5,Lovin' Mine,"Bought the ""American"" version and then successfully used the instructions in other user comments to convert it to a region free version. Hooked it up to my Hi-Def projection set and watched a UK DVD. Worked beautifully. Quick and easy to set up. Quick and easy to make region free. Picture quality was excellent."
2,The most annoying dvd player ever!,"This player does play everything including PAL and Divx. However it is a pain to use it.The player doesn't turn on if you press the 'play' button, you have to remember to press the 'on' key first. It doesn't open, unless you press 'on' key first. There is no open/close button on the remote, so to change a dvd you have to: 1.Press On button. 2. Wait until it loads the dvd it has inside it. 3. then press the open/close button on the dvd player, then wait some more until it actually opens. Depending on the disk you have inside it, the process takes about 1-2 min. This is very inconvenient and extremely annoying."
5,Excellent buy,This DVD player did everything I expected.$40 + shipping for a DIVX capable DVD player is very cheap!Great buy!!
4,region free at low price,"This is nice looking and solid built machine. The best thing is that it supports DVDs from all regions, although some hacking are needed (you can find it the highest review). The remote control is very ugly and hard to navigate in the set up menu. Other than that I would give it a 5 star rating.If you have DVDs from Germany, Japan, etc. you may want to buy this one. It may be the cheapest one that really supports region free dvd and divx."
5,Great DVD Player,"This player is smooth. It works great. I had to replace my 5 year old model when it became finicky about playing any DVD's even new discs. I had to clean and re-clean just to get my old model to play. After purchasing a few concert DVD's and music videos my old player just buzzed without playing then display ""no disc'.This Phillips just purrs, I can watch any of my music videos and movies without problems or a big hassle. The controls are pretty simple and the remote is very light like an IPOD. Although I haven't tried any other formats, I'm very happy with my purchase and received it in just a few days."
3,decent,load & unload are a bit slow.Remote sensing is giving me problems - have to keep a button pressed for a couple of secs.Works decent - above average for the price
4,Great product,"Another terrific product from Phillips at a fair price. It plays everything that I throw at it. The remote is easy to use and setting up the player requires no degree of experience. The only down side that I've experienced so far is that the player turns itself off after it's been in the pause mode for several minutes. That is annoying. I pause my movies/episodes often and after the player shuts itself down I end up needing to fast forward to the part that I paused the movie or worse, select the file and then fast forward to the scene. Again, very annoying. So, other than that I am very pleased with the playback quality, the versatility of the formats that it plays and the super basic remote control."
3,"Plays all my discs well, ...","In buying this unit I finally have a player that plays all my discs (including DVDs for all other regions after I programmed it) well, especially my burned DVD-R's and VCD's. It does not have outputs for S-Video or optical digital audio or a frame-by-frame/step function on the remote, none of which I thought about checking for before I bought the unit. The component video signal is grainy but, since I use my TV's component video inputs for another player, it's not enough for me to return the unit. Overall, the player does what I bought it for at a good price."
2,not that pleased,This product arrived slit opened and rummaged thru. I have 2 other similar dvd players and this one does not perform as well. It works but it's not what I thought it would be. I would not order it again nor recommend it to anyone.
4,expensive cable not included,This unit is so slim and light it almost disappears. A light push on the standby button can send the unit back and inch or two or across the room if you wish. It works just fine. No complaints. A heck of a good price. But if you plan on using the component video output for your LCD (or other) TV to obtain the best picture be aware the cable is not included and costs about as much as the player.
4,Review Title of the Gooooooooods!!,"Well, no one was really exaggerating about the slowness of the player. Like, I don't care that there's no eject button on the remote, but I don't feel like sitting for any extended period of time on the damn floor in front of my TV while I wait for a disc to come out. That's just bad manners on the player's part to keep me waiting like that. I tried the region-free code on here and it worked, but I've not actually used any non-region 1 discs yet. It plays quite a bit of stuff, but nothing wider than 720 pixels. And no MKVs, OGMs, or other similar files. Still, that leaves you with a ton of stuff it still plays. And even though the load times aren't fantastic, it's not a bad player at all. Once you consider how much it costs on here for all the features that you get, it's very much worth it. I only gave it four stars because I happen to LIKE watching MKVs and OGMs, so I'm a little bummed there."
3,Multi-regional DVD Player,"So far, this player seems to work well. My one complaint is that the remote does not have an open/close button like my last player did. I got this Phillips player b/c it was cheap and I needed a multiformat dvd player. It's functional but not fancy."
1,Shoddy remote censor makes this DVD player nearly unusable,"The picture and audio from this DVD player are fine. There is a serious problem with the remote sensor. It only works from five feet away or less, and only if you're within 30 degrees of the sensor. The problem is not with the remote, as I have the same problem with a Pioneer universal remote. Look at the other reviews, they also complain about the remote. This DVD player is only useful in very small rooms. Even within this Cone of Sensitivity, it doesn't register button presses about a third of the time. I decided to give it a week, but after two days my wife and I are already tired of it."
3,Review title,"A good DVD player for the price, plays everything I put into it, mostly DVD+/-R and DVD+R DL. Lots of features and easy menu system. The only issue I have with it is the remote control. It only works when pointed directly at the DVD player, a foot to the left or right and the button pressing on the remote control has no effect and these are brand new batteries."
3,The player is just average,The player is just average. It is not able to run all the DVDs. It looks good and slim but there are lots of functionalities missing.
2,no audio on new player,"looks as if quality control is not doing a very good job here, are these put together in China? any way it would not play the audio had to send it back. reordered another model a DVP 642 also a philips it worked great hate to give a bad review because it was Philips letting a defective product be sent out to the dealer to be sold ,not the sellers fault ,it is in a sealed box, how are they to know.money was refunded and all but took up waisted time returning. Wake up Philips! what else do you forget to make work? or put together half as#ed."
1,Terrible failure rate,TWO out of THREE purchased were bad out of the box! You pay little...you get little.
3,Philips DVP5140,"Everything is fine, exept that there is not remote eject button and like in the 60th I have to manually push the button to load/unload CD from the player."
5,"philips dvd 5140 multformat dvd player with divx, mp3","I'm very glad then I bougth this product,it work for, I need very good.So far so good.I use both system dvd disc both play good,why we need spent to much if this is good. thank you Joe!!!"
4,Love it! Now I can watch DVDs from amazon UK,"There are so many things we like to watch that are only available in PAL format. Now that we have this DVD player, we can watch whatever we want. We would not have known how to make it multi-region without the helpful instructions of another Amazon reviewer, though, so I can't give the product five stars...have to dock it one star for murky instructions. There is nothing fancy about this product, but who cares? It works, and the price is good."
4,"Easy to set up, easy to use","I purchased this dvd player as an emergency replacement, and so far have not regretted it! It was easy to set up, and is easy to use. I had it playing my region 2 disks in a matter of moments. The drawer is a little slow in opening, but that alone is no reason to send it back. Just wait the 30 seconds and it'll open!My only complaint was in the shipping. I ordered it from Target through Amazon (as they had the better price). I received it ahead of schedule, but was dismayed when I saw the packaging. Or should I say lack of packaging? All they did was slap the shipping information on the dvd box itself and sent it along it's way. I would have preferred it to arrive within another box, masking what the product was. They way it was shipped just screams ""Steal Me!""But, as that's my only complaint, and not necessarily Amazon's fault, I give it four stars!"
1,Code Free Hack No Longer Works! Sigh...,"I have just received it from Amazon.com and tried all the codes I could found over the Internet. Unfortunately, none of them works and REGION ERR keeps on showing up. This new DVD player does not provide Preference as a choice."
3,Liked it but it failed after 4-months,"This player played everything I recorded on DVD+R well, but over the past two weeks it has been pausing and then quit loading altogether. Now it won't read anything, including new commercial DVDs. I like the unit well enough, and it is inexpensive enough that I am going to try a second one."
4,Worth it's price...,"If you buy it at say.. Circuit City :-). This machine is a definite improvement over DVP642. The biggest ""-"" is missing S-Video out.This is not Oppo 971, obviously. But it plays almost anything. And what did you expect? There is no ""perfect"" player. At least not in $50-60 price range and even 2x of it."
1,DOES *NOT* PLAY PAL DVDs,"Caution: if you are buying this machine to play PAL (European) DVDs, stop right here. It says right on the box it plays North American disks only. I matched the stock # and product # to the Web site to make sure Amazon shipped the machine I ordered - they had - so the description on this page must be for some other model. Be very careful before you buy this machine. It is *not* as described."
1,Does NOT play Region 2 DVDs,"This might be a fine DVD player. I wouldn't know; I never got it out of the box. The reason for the low rating is the misinformation on the Amazon.com page, which led me to believe the model DVP5140 is a multi-region player. But as soon as it arrived, I saw a big statement on the box saying this was for Region 1 (USA) DVDs only. The whole reason I bought it was to play DVDs that are only available in Region 2 (UK) formatting. So I sent it back. Amazon customer service couldn't find a DVD player that fit what I need. So now I'm just down one major gift idea."
1,"lier, liar pants on fire...","Search on region 2 DVD player and this is the first one up. Only thing is - it doesn't play region 2 DVDs.All I can say is beware of the search - I expect the items down the line to match a search less, but first up? BS, this shouldn't happen."
1,Amazon MultiRegion for Dummies,"I searched Amazon and found this unit to play Region 1-3 DVD's.Simple? Well. The term MuliFormat in the descriptionplus the reviews seemed to show this was a good choiceso I bought.But right on the box before I opened it, it said:""This set plays DVD sold in the US only (Region 1).""We need some help in these Amazon page descriptions!MULTIREGION FOR DUMMIES should de offered defining theterms MulitFormat, MultiRegion, MultiZone, etc etcIf a player is limited to Region 1, the Amazon descriptionshould say ""Plays Region 1 only.""If a player will play Region 1-3, but you need to be a whizby playing around entering codes (see review this page) everytime you want to watch a DVD, the Amazon descriptionshould say ""Plays Region 1-3 with program code entry only.""If a player will play Region 1-3 automatically withouthassles, the Amazon description should say ""Plays Region 1-3."""
2,DISAPPOINTING,"Love Pat Paulsen. Children must have been writing this show! Some good guest stars (Mike Connors!), some (stress, some) funny bits especially the VW and the sledgehammer and pleading for more than 13 episodes, and a clip from the first Smothers Brothers Show with Pat as a ""famous star"". Don't regret getting, as I really like Pat, but he was let down by writing and deserved better. Colour and print quality are okay, but considering the age I thought it would be better. Dean Martin shows from the '60s look better.If you pick it up for around $15, you'll probably find enough to justify its purchase especially if you like Pat. (Still remember him quite vividly in an episode of ""The Wild, Wild West""!)"
2,Disappointing,"I originally watched this show when it was first broadcast, but could not remember much. Being a Pat Paulsen fan I purchased this series to re-kindle that enthusiasm. Unfortunately, my enthusiasm was somewhat dimmed. The production qualities are excellent, but I now recall why this series was canceled after 13 weeks. Pat was a great monologist, and his deadpan delivery of comical material was top notch. But he was not a great sketch comic. There is not much to recommend as far as funny bits are concerned. In fact some of the sketches were downright terrible and repetitive (""Peanut Brittle, Mister"" and ""Then Came Paulsen"" being the two worst, in my opinion). This set also includes a collection of his later commercials, which are funnier than some of the comedy routines. Perhaps someone can collect his ""Smothers Brothers"" appearances. That was where he was at his funniest."
3,"ok, not great","This handbook was pretty good, but I actually found it to be an unnecessary addition to my clinical experience. I certainly wouldn't say it was a ""must have"" like some of the other handbooks I've used."
5,Clinical Handbook for Maternal Newborn Nursing & Women's Health Care (7th Edition),"I love this book, it provided all accurate informations. It's easy to read and to understand. I purchased used book, it has no marking on it. Nice and clean book. Thank you very much."
3,A book that influenced our time,"This a book that influenced both communism and fascism. Although it was written from the perspective of the political left, its most enthusiastic reader was probably Benito Mussolini. It shows the compatibility of certain aspects of communism and fascism. It is surprising that it is not widely studied in courses on fascism. For more books on totalitarianism I have created a Listmania list.The book itself is not easy to read. It, however, is important to read this in order to get an understanding on underlying philosophical forces that produced modern totalitarianism."
3,A Nice read for a slow day,"Lawrence, Duke of Deakin, is on a mission to get a rich wife. Miss Juliet Jones, a New York heiress, will do quite nicely, Lawrence decides. But there's just one hitch: Juliet is a romantic and will not be married for her money. The game is on, with Lawrence in danger of losing his heart..."
4,Like entering a dream,"Having been raised in the north, I had very little idea or interest in the history of New Orleans. Upon visiting this wonderous city for a business trip years ago, I was fasinated and intriquied by the dreamlike quality this city exists in. A strange mixture of past and present, of mixed cultures and traditions and the feeling that ghosts are at every corner. I found Lyle Saxon's book at our local library by accident, the version published in 1928. The first chapter had me glued to a book for the first time in years. Reading about his own adventures in New Orleans, abet generations before my time, brought a familiar sense that has stayed with me since that first visit. it may be difficult to read this book and visualize if you haven't been, and if you have been, it's like remembering a beautiful dream or a part of your childhood you had forgotten. Visit the city and then buy this book."
5,Intriguing history lessons,"Having been totally seduced by a trip to New Orleans last fall, finding this book (despite its dated references) was like opening a wonderous treasure chest. Saxon's narrative is informed and at times personal, and Sudyam's illustrations only reinforce this. Along with the current books about New Orleans, this is a must read. New Orleans is an old city with a storied history, not all of it pleasant. See the city through the eyes of Lyle Saxon and see history come alive."
5,from a local,absolutely incredible! the book is as mesmerizing as the City herself. lyle saxon's personal accounts make this book so much more than just a history lesson. i highly recommend it!
3,Universal Tail Pipe,"Good quality, but no clamps or hangers. It is a universal 4 piece kit slip together kit, not a specific one piece application as shown in photos. Takes cutting to fit application"
2,Is not backwards-compatible with the Xbox 360,"This game only works on the original Xbox. If you try on the 360, a prompt simply tells you that it won't work. I just wanted to play the original Street Fighter 2.The Xbox 360 Capcom Digital Collection does have some of the same games. But only 8 of them compared to the 22 on this one!"
4,Neglected genius of 20th century drama,"Ionesco is the neglected genius of twentieth-century drama. He allows his imagination to roam free and unfettered across the stage. Word-play, dream-like situations and transformations; at once hilarious, terrifying and heart-breaking. Time for a revival?"
