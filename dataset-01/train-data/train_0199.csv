3,Funny stuff,"A highly enjoyable read. The early chapters were particularly hysterical, causing me to laugh out loud numerous times as Sedaris described growing up as an effeminate boy with a frustrating lisp. I'm not a big memoir reader, particularly those of people who are most famous for writing a memoir, but word of mouth led me to give this one a shot and I'm glad it did. I didn't find the entire book quite as hysterical as the first few chapters but it did make for a pleasant read and I continue to get a kick out of the catchy title."
5,The David Sedaris Starter Kit,"One mark of a great book is when you laugh out loud alone. This book accomplishes the feat, and my main complaint is that it didn't last longer. Sedaris is an engaging presenter live, and I'd suggest watching or listening to him speak before reading the book. You'll understand the comic timing and the absurdity of some of the stories more. Highly recommended."
4,Loved it!,"I bought this book for one of my Writing Arts classes and I had never heard of David Sedaris. I thought the book was awesome, very funny, and worth the money. I would definitely recommend it to others!"
3,"Acerbic, Witty and Brimming with Dark Humor","On the recommendation of a co-worker, I picked up a copy Me Talk Pretty One Day and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a very hilarious and entertaining book. Author David Sedaris is so full of intelligent humor and sharp wit.Through a series of essays, Me Talk Pretty One Day painted a vivid and insightful snapshot of the author's family dynamic, his struggle back with drug abuse and personal redemption. There were so many laugh-out loud moments in the book, especially stories involving Sedaris' brother Paul and some of my favorite chapters were the author's time living in France.Sedaris is a wonderful contemporary storyteller, especially when he is describing everyday interactions with other people. The stories of his personal development were quite hilarious, sometimes painful but always interesting to read."
4,Me Read More Sedaris Some Day,"After years and years of dumbfounded stares when I mention I haven't read Sedaris, I decided I'd better give him a chance. I think I steered myself awy from Sedaris because I'm typically not a fan of funny books (if only because I rarely find them funny). Sedaris has proved an exception, and I kept thinking about Twain as chuckled my way to the finish. There is a similarity, at least insofar as Sedaris has a similar biting wit that may prove to transcend generations like Twain -- although I don't feel as though Sedaris is as good a writer.But yeah, lots of good stuff. Stuff I could relate to. Stuff that makes me want to see Sedaris on another one of his book tours. He's got a new book out. Something about chipmunks. I'll have to check it out."
3,Not Laugh out loud but definately an occasional smirk,"David Sedaris has put together many short stories and essays. Some not laugh out loud but defintely brings a smirk at times, amusing and entertaiing at other times. I found my ratings from each of the stories went from a 6 star, to a 1 star to a 4 star to a 3,4,6,4,6,5,1,2,3, and so on.You will understand if all the brilliant stories were in one book yes it would deserve a 5 star, but sadly they are scattered through some very average ones. My overall rating on this book is a 3.5 star. Definately worth a listen. Maybe try one of his other ones first."
3,It's ok.,"The parts about his troubles growing up with imperfect speech and other difficulties were touching and illuminating, but, unlike ""Holidays of Ice"" and readings I'd heard on ""The Late Show with David Letterman,"" the only times I really laughed while reading this book were during the anecdotes about his sister Amy. So I read ""Wigfield"" next."
4,Mostly hysterically funny . . .,"This is the first book by David Sedaris that I have read and, for the most part, it was very funny. During certain portions (I am ashamed to include one short scatological piece among them) I was laughing out loud. Others were very funny in a more ""dry"" sense.The first portion of the book is Sedaris' autobiography of growing up in a quirky family, dealing with a not-too-successful speech therapist, and working (?) as an artist and in other trades. Next, he describes his stays in France at his friend's house in the country and in Paris. Anyone who has spent time in France, and struggled with the French language, will be able to relate to the humourous situations.This is definitely a good book if you need some chuckles and some loud laughs!"
2,2.5 stars- I'm on the Fence,"I got ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" with different expectations that I probably should have had. I was expecting a novel, but I got a bunch of short stories. I HATE short stories, but that's my own fault for not researching more before I picked it up, right?So, I grin and bear it for a few stories, but then feel like maybe I'm reading an Augusten Burroughs novel instead? I know technically ""Me Talk..."" came out at the same time as ""Running With Scissors"", both originally released in 2001, but the stories are so similar to Augusten's that I had to go back and check the covers. Yup. Sedaris. Okay... moving on.Yeah, he's funny. Sure he has some great moments. But, is he really as funny as HE thinks HE is?If I had read this book BEFORE reading Augusten Burroughs's books... maybe I would have loved it a little more. I honestly DID love ""Naked"" by Sedaris- laugh out loud funny.But ""Me Talk..."" just wasn't... good."
3,Always Enjoyable,"Good book. Not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is full of the kind of humor you would expect from Sedaris. Well worth the price and effort."
3,Funny but not my favorite Sedaris collection.....,"ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is another collection featuring David Sedaris' especially mordant and hilarious sense of humor. He muses on the most ordinary events, but gives us a unique perspective.My two favorite stories concern his childhood guitar lessons and his sojourn with his French boyfriend renovating a house in the French countryside.While reading David Sedaris is entertaining in itself, nothing compares to HEARING him tell his stories on audiotape or CD. His humor comes through so much more vividly through his voice and not the printed word. Do yourself a favor and pick up an audio copy even if you've read the book. The experience is greatly enhanced. I know because I first encountered his work from listening to the audio version of NAKED, which is to this day my absolute Sedaris favorite!"
1,Not impressed,I did not laugh. The guy is not interesting. The writing is amateurish dime store bookish. The humor is high school level.I really liked the title. Thats all.
4,Sedaris Bites A Froggy,"Although ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" is an excellent collection of stories, it is not Sedaris's best work. However when it's ""Holidays on Ice"" you're comparing it to, how can it live up to expectation? Though it does have some truly hilarious stories, check out ""You Can't Kill the Rooster"" and ""A Shiner Like A Diamond"", the whole of the book is not nearly as funny as earlier work. For a writer as gifted as Sedaris, France seems too easy a target and it often falls a little flat. But when the subject is his wonderfully insane family, the words are absolute bliss. It is not that this is a bad book, in fact it is a great book. But after reading the other work, I have come to expect more and I know Sedaris can fulfill his readers high expectations."
3,"Funny, but not Uber Funny","This book is funny; however I definitely have read things far more comedic. I like the short story format, and some of the stories are great - however I did not read the first book, Naked, so perhaps I am slightly out of the loop. Despite the fact it isn't supremely funny there are some laugh out loud moments that make the book certainly worth your while."
5,Laugh Out Loud,"I want more! This book was very funny, easy to read and sad to finish (only because I did not want it to end.)The chapters are all thoughts on random events about Sedaris' life. The topics are Seinfeld-ish. They range from talking about a large poo left in the toliet to realizing that he sounds so bad speaking French he just stops talking.The stories get better as you move on so don't become discouraged if you don't like the beginning of the book.I would not recommend this as a gift for a grandparent, an in-law or someone you don't know well as the subject matter may offend. Also, if you're into amazingly well written colorful language, this book may not be for you. His writing style is simple and colorful, but not in a descriptive way.However, if you're looking for a quick read, a good laugh and an escape from your problems, give this book a try."
4,a really funny read-and very empathetic,"David Sedaris's style is wonderful. It is surpassed only by his imagination for topics to write about. The chapter on learning French had me on the floor laughing. Nearly 30 years, ago when we emigrated to Israel, we attended daily classes in Hebrew and his stringing together of sentences reminded me so much of myself at that time. Highly recommended for anyone who likes quirky humour and a great writing style."
5,Outstanding: I almost shot coffee out of my nose...,"What can be said? Truly one of the best story tellers around. Yes, I've read a number of the stories in other places previously or heard him read them live (a treat unto itself) but I cracked up just as hard the second time. The new ones were hysterical.Do yourself a favor and catch him live. The book was well worth the wait. Outstanding."
5,Savor the laughter!!!,"I have taken my sweet time getting to the end of this book. And now I am rewarded for my efforts. Sedaris's 'Dress your family...' is about to arrive on June 1st. HIP HIP HOORAY!!!!'Me talk pretty...' is so WONDERFULLY REFRESHING. I have taken a lot of time to get through it because I just don't want it to end.But NOW I can finish it and enjoy a new Sedaris book in just a few days.'Naked' was my first introduction to Sedaris and I found myself laughing even harder with 'Me talk pretty one day'. He depicts his life adventures (trully that is what they are) with such dry humor that you will indeed find yourself laughing in public, if you chose to venture outdoors with his books. The reader should be warned!I LOVE DAVID SEDARIS!!! BUY HIS BOOKS, NOW.(Except for 'Barrel Fever', not as funny.)"
5,Hilarious!!!,"I'm reading this book again on the eve of a family week-long trip to Paris. Although I know I thoroughly enjoyed the book the first time, it is just and funny and fresh on the second read. I'm not the type who normally laughs out loud while reading or watching t.v. for that matter, but certain pieces in this book have had me in TEARS!!! David Sedaris is a genius! I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes brainy satire and enjoys a good laugh..."
3,"Hysterical beginning, but doesn't maintain throughout","I could hardly put the book down as I read the first chapter. However, I was disappointed as I continued through the book. I did not find the subsequent chapters as entertaining. It was a easy read for vacation, but it did not keep me engaged."
3,Sedaris writes Funny but Repetitive,"I recently read ""Me Talk Pretty One Day"" and ""Naked"" (both by David Sedaris). Sedaris' style is very funny, tongue in cheek though some of the humor is extremely subtle. Anyone with a dry sense of humor will enjoy this, and gay men who can relate to the vignettes about growing up different will find it especially familiar.The later chapters of each book seem to have a sitcom-esque quality to them, though. The chapters seem to end where they began, as if they could be read in any order. Despite the subtlety of the humor, the comedy seems dull and repetitive by the end of the book. ..."
3,Not As I Expected...,Me Talk Pretty One DayVery quick read it keeps you wanting to turn the page if you dont know whats coming next but then nothing really interesting comes next! It had a few make you smile moments but after reading the reviews I thought Id be laughing out loud at this book.I didnt.And I have a good sense of humor...it just seemed he tried to hard.
5,Made me laugh hard!!!!!,"This was the first book I have read of David Sedaris. It was sitting in my ""to read"" pile for a long time because I did not think I would like it. How wrong I was. Made me laugh out loud. Great book to read if you have had a hard week or if you just want to read a good book."
4,"All Good, Some Great","The only missing star from my review is that not every essay is up to the full Sedaris potential... But some of them certainly are, and are great. Reflective, funny and even touching at times, Sedaris makes you want to be friends with a moving company ex-felon who ""would like to say he'd never kill anybody again, but that's a very serious promise to make."""
4,"""You Can't Kill The Rooster""","This collection contains what may be the funniest piece Sedaris has yet written, ""You Can't Kill the Rooster."" It's about David's feisty, incredibly foul-mouthed brother and the touching relationship he has with their father. The first time I read it I nearly killed myself laughing (Paul Sedaris sounds like Daffy Duck crossed with a hardcore rapper.) Pure greatness."
2,Boring book but...He would make a great ghost writer.,"This is a person who grew up in a middle class family, has a pushy, over-supportive Dad, experiments with drugs, and ends up hooking up with a Sugar Daddy. This book was like sitting through an extemely bad After School Special. I have to admit his simplistic-sarcastic writing style did hold my attention but it would be great if he had something interesting to write about... like someone else's life -- someone who has got past thinking their story of growing up in middle America is an incredible epic.Get over yourself!"
2,We Are Not Amused,"I have to agree with the minority reviewers who thought this wasn't very funny. This is my first Sedaris book and I've heard lots of hype about how hilarious he is. Mind you, I have a wicked, twisted sense of humor, am gay, a former writer, and make my friends crack up constantly. So, I figured someone like Sedaris would have me in stitches. I'm about halfway through the book and I think I snorted a little (in laughter, not illicit chemicals) only once. Other than that I've barely cracked a smile. I don't get why people think this is so hilarious? It's not awful by any stretch, but it's hardly side-splitting humor. I hate to say it, but I think on a bad day I'm funnier than this. Honestly, I'm a little bummed. I wanted to laugh. Really I did."
5,Great collection of essays,"This is my second David Sedaris book, and after the mixed feelings I have regarding Barrel Fever I can say this is much better overall. Sedaris describes, through vaguely connected essays, his own often difficult battle with communication, and the insights he gains are painfully funny. A bit like an autobiography, ""Me Talk"" is layered throughout with Sedaris' bits of wisdom and wit, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I didn't find myself rolling in the floor with laughter except on a few occasions, but the book as a whole is a good look at the difficulty we all have on occasion to say what we really mean, or let people know what we're thinking. The parts about Sedaris' efforts to learn French and justifiably cited as the funniest parts, but I also enjoyed the essay dealing with his stint as a college teacher, assigning writing projects on soap operas. This is a good introduction to Sedaris, and I recommend it highly."
5,Hilarious collection of essays...,"I have heard David Sedaris on PRI's ""This American Life"" a few times, and was always sad when his autobiographical essays would come to an end. Always the highlight of any show in which they were featured, these hysterical accounts of expatriate living in France, growing up in North Carolina or what have you even forced me to pull my car over one day for fear of laughing myself into an accident.This collection of essays incites the same feelings, though thankfully this time I don't have to fear a collision while I enjoy them."
2,kind of ok,"While the essays are intelligently written the book lacks the funniness that the reviews make it out to have. The only essay that made me laugh out loud was Big Boy, I guess bathroom humor is funny no matter how old you are. I had such high hopes for this book but was disappointed."
5,"I laughed until I cried, then laughed more until my jaw ached","Suffice it to say that Sedaris is not to everyone's taste. However, you would have to be pretty humorless not to appreciate his unique perspective on subjects as diverse as his family and his experiences as a not-so-innocent abroad in France who initially has no interest in learning the language--then six years into his French experience, finally takes on the mother tongue with all he has--which he is quick to admit isn't much.A lot of fun, and if you're having a tough personal time, Sedaris will show you how much better off you are than he is! (But really, the man's a best-seller, so he can't be too bad!)If your humor goes a little left of center, this is a good read for you."
5,Me thought funny EVERY day,"This book has made me laugh more than any book I have ever read. I was constantly interrupting my husband's work to say, ""you have to read this."" I would read him bits and he would be cracking up.Every ounce of his commentary on the world around him is just histerical and so true. He can turn even something as tragic as drug abuse into sidesplitting humor. I couldn't pick a favorite chapter because each one is as funny as the last.I plan to pass this book along to all of my friends and family. Anyone with a sense of humor, and even those without one, will fall over laughing."
5,reading this book is equivelent to doing 100 ab cruches,"Because you laugh so hard at practically every other sentence. This was my first taste of the wonderfully insightful and incontinence-inducing David Sedaris. After reading Holidays on Ice and Naked, I'm still a fan of his latest. I picked up this book from a pile of crap from Costco that my mom had bought and scanned the book jacket blurb. Referring to Sedaris as a ""spooky man child"" was what hooked me. This became my favorite book because I could read it 100 times and the humor would still be fresh and hysterical. I fell in love with David Sedaris while I read it and would often flip to the back cover to smile at his cute little face. READ THIS BOOK."
4,"Great Stories, Reading A Bit Whiny","It would seem fitting for David Sedaris to narrate his own life story, but I find myself annoyed from time to time with how he reads it. Like he's complaining about everything. Maybe he is, but it's not fun to listen to.But I can ignore it and laugh at the hillarious stories."
5,Back to Funny,"I read Naked and loved the book. So, I bought another one of his books and it wasn't so good. So, I decided to read one more and this one is hilarious. I think him being out of the country and the language barrier makes this even funnier. Good stuff here. Very funny."
5,Me Talk Pretty One Day,"Naya Rivera recommended this book in People Magazine. I loved it. I have never laughed out loud at any book and this book was really funny. I got some strange looks from my coworkers when I read in the break room at work. I snorted, giggled and chortled with abandon! I will have to find out how to get in touch with Naya to see what she's reading now. She knows how to pick good books!"
4,Sedaris!,"Easy reading, took me away to places I dont usually go. Imagination is such a giftRead it if you would like to have a good time and marvel at writers like Sedars."
4,Typical Sedaris!,"If you like David Sedaris, you'll like this book. If you're reading him for the first time, you'll be alternately amused, shocked, in complete agreement and in total opposition to what he puts on the page. Not for the conservative-minded reader! It's dark comedy, and you may leave laughing with a heavy heart."
5,The Misanthrope,"The title story of this collection never fails to send me into fits of laughter, and I am not one to laugh easily. If you have not heard David Sedaris on the radio, then you really must try to see him at one of his readings or book signings. His stories are best heard out loud, and no one tells them better than Sedaris himself. That being said, the written stories are excellent and this collection in particular must be owned.The standard Sedaris fare is here as he mercilessly picks on the members of his own family (as well as on himself) for humor's sake. My favorite stories, however, all concern his misadventures in France among the French as well as among the Americans he meets abroad. His sadistic French teacher (of several stories including the title story) and the American couple on the subway who assume he is French and speak openly about him in English are just classic foils for Sedaris's misanthropic character. Humor writing doesn't get any better than this.Jeremy W. Forstadt"
4,"A Fun, Brilliant Read","I too feel like the gushing reviews somewhat dampened my otherwise pleasant experience with this book. For me, it would have been better without so many critics insisting I would love the book. But that said, he IS funny and this book is well worth reading. His self-deprecation grounds the story, and his characterizations of his family are incredibly vivid. I just wish future editions would pare down the reviewers' comments."
5,Me laugh on airplane out loud one day,"This book is an appropriate follow up to David Sedaris' ""Naked,"" and gut-busting hysterical as a warped series of essays can get. Sedaris' struggle with learning French is peppered throughout the book, which gets funnier as you go along. I drew stares as I read this on an airplane trip, as my fellow passengers wondered what I could be reading that would have me laughing so hard. This is by far the funniest Sedaris collection of essays available, from the chapter about the author trying to explain the rabbit's role in the American celebration of Easter to his speech therapy sessions to his observations of the midget who taught Sedaris how to play the guitar. This is great bedside, bathroom or airplane reading, enough to entertain you in the most twisted and pleasant of ways. Right up there with ""The Santaland Diaries."""
4,absolutely hilarious,"I have never read a book so consistantly funny. I wasn't laughing at every page, but there was at least one line or paragraph in each essay that honestly made me laugh out loud. I won't give any away; enough are posted here. Any more, and I'd give away half the laughs.I'll admit, I wondered what was going on in Sedaris' head at some points, but at others his thoughts so closely mirrored my own that it was just too funny. His one-liners and anecdotes are wonderfully witty (my favorite was the American tourists in Paris who arrogantly think no one else on the train speaks English). He accurately points out negative qualities of Americans in the second half, yet he doesn't talk down to his readers as he himself is a lazy loaf who spends most of his time in France in a movie theater. Just wonderful. You'll laugh your way through it."
5,An extraordinarily unique writer,"Sedaris does it again. This one is not as entertaining as ""Naked"" but still does the job. Sedaris writes about the full spectrum of human feelings and makes it funny, hysterically, at the same time. So good, you can barely put it down, I promise you that."
4,"Super start, slower later","I was in tears I was laughing so hard during this book. David Sedaris is a wonderful writer. He keeps your interest and the words flow so well throughout. Sedaris is great with dialog. Every conversation is realistic. You only have to read his stuff once.Whether he is describing music class when he is young or apartment shopping when older Sedaris speaks with realism, wit and that ever present bit of sarcasism.I am not prone to peeking into other peoples windows but I love to walk through the 'rich neighborhoods' and sort of NOTICE how those other people live. Sedaris describes his similar experience but with the humor that I never thought of.But this is a memoir not a novel so at times the book losses a bit of focus. It doesn't really go anywhere. Even so it is really fun to read and that's why I picked it up, to be entertained. And I was. With that in my mind it is worth reading. There are not many books today that give you a good laugh and are well written too."
2,Didn't laugh once,"maybe its just not my type of humor. i didnt particulary find any of the essays funny enough to laugh out loud, in fact some of them i wondered why others considered them to be funny at all. i read plenty of reviews on the book and the author and was very excited to start reading the book. i am sad to say that i am left very disappointed."
1,Can somebody tell me what was funny about this book?,"From reading the reviews for this book it is clear that this book isn't funny to everybody. I was expecting at least a couple of laughs out of the 270 pages, but it never really happened. This book is written as an autobiography about someone to whom nothing significantly interesting happened in his entire life. The book is composed of banal anectodes that could happen to anybody but that nobody would ever think of writing a book about. The first part of the book is definitely not funny, whereas the second part is slightly better. I got this book as a present and I'm glad I didn't spend any of my own money on it. If you want to read a biography, read one about someone who lived an interesting life!"
1,Did I miss something,"I guess I missed something when I read this book. I didn't find it funny at all.... in fact... I never laughed to myself let alone out loud. I was highly disappointed in this book. Having never read any other of his works so I have nothing to compare this to, I would not buy any other of his works."
1,Soooo overrated!,"Let the Sedaris fans lap it up, but for me, this book has no edge whatsoever. What's the difference between a performance monologuist such as Sedaris or Spalding Gray and a stand-up comedian? The latter at least has punchlines, but the former just drones on and on. This is cutesy, soft, overly-pleasant stuff - the same people who watch ""Mystery"" on PBS will love it - perfect for readers who do not want to be disturbed or think too much."
1,Running on Empty,"I love a funny read more than anything. But this is too distracting. Okay, he wants to go to Paris-- big deal. The first half of the book almost lost me. I don't think a story has to be so mindless to order to get a rise. There are a lot of other funny writers who still have something to say. Take Orozco's ""Delano."" It's funny in the tradition of Catch 22, and it makes some important observations about society and education."
1,Can I get a refund?,"I bought the book with much anticipated expectation. Its reviews promised a funny-can't-put-down-must-read-book.All I can say is that I read it. Now I want a refund so I can buy something REALLY FUNNY. And belive me, I LOVE DARK HUMOR. But this felt short. If your readers really want to read A FUNNY BOOK, READ ""e"" by Matt Beaumont or any of the three books by Margot Kaufman. Now THOSE are funny!"
2,Less than humorous,"I hate to say it, but I'm tossing the Sedaris book aside. I find it absolutely dreadful--not to mention boring. Several people recommended the book which surprises me. He's unfunny. I'm tired, too, of the repressed-boy-homo theme that so many gay men like to write about. Yawn!"
3,Not up to his usual high standards.,"I usually get a laugh from David Sedaris, but this book seemed a bit sparse in that department. Still, he's the funniest essayist since James Thurber, so who's complaining?"
2,Loses steam towards the end,The story is rather interesting until you hit the last few chapters where you realize it's more of the same. The author is able to communicate his sense of humor and life experiences and I was engaged until I realized that I was not going to get any insightful life lesson learned from his stories.
5,Inspire...,"I have read this book about 7 times, I can't stop reading it, is just the perfect mixture of real life, sarcasm, our inner dreams, fears and thought, our insecurities, is just a great book from some one who is a great observer."
1,Incomplete pages,I bought a used book and I am not happy about it. Few pages of this book were gone.
1,A quick glaze over some good topics - but,"I think a book costing this much money should provide in-depth coverage of the topics. This looks like a rush job to me and very sophomoric. How do books like this make it through production?I'm starting to wonder if the publisher, No Starch Press, has a preference for bad grammar, poorly written material and goofy authors. I wouldn't have so much of a problem with it if I hadn't purchased it. But I did.I did see some value in this book. The authors organized the subjects well. I also found a few tidbits like how to connect to X remotely over ssh. The configuration of DHCP was nice.Here's the but. To cover the topics appropriately, the publisher should have broken this into a series of books. It's not a Bible, it's not a chapter in a Bible, it's an excuse for a book.I'm starting to get a feel for this publisher and I don't like what I see. You have to see it for yourself."
1,There has to be something better than this!,I was looking for a reference 'Bible' and this was a total disappointment. There isn't even a list of commands in this book! If you are looking for a reference book this is not it. If you want an overview of Debian this could answer some of your questions.
3,A big disappointment for this Nancy Ann doll fan!,"After seeing the colorful cover, I was shocked to find page after page of fuzzy, black and white photos inside this book. How wonderful it would have been to have seen some of these beautiful dolls in color or at least in well-lighted pictures! The author obviously seems to prefer the older bisque dolls, which are covered in most of the book. A shorter section is devoted to the hard plastics, which many collectors love. Does anyone really want to see so many pages of patterns for Nancy Ann doll furniture? I would have rather read about or seen dolls!"
3,It Was The Original Nancy Ann Book,"The author (who is now deceased) wrote this book with the information she had collected. Since then, it has been further researched, new facts were collected, new pictures taken, and now Elaine Pardee's ""Encyclopedia of Nancy Ann Storybook Dolls"" is the result of this research. This book was wonderful when it was published, and I still love it.Mary"
2,nancy ann storybook dolls,"I felt the book was incomplete, it only had two pages of color pictures and the description led me to believe it would have more of a complete listing and photos of the complete line."
3,Nancy Ann Storybook Dolls Book,Considering how long ago the dolls were produced this is a helpful book for those trying to identify their dolls. It is true that 95% of the pictures are in black & white which makes it much more difficult to recognize but it is better then no picture. Also there are several mistakes in the discriptions of some dolls and wrong accessories on some of the dolls. Lets just hope that a new and improved version (with color photos) will soon be available.
2,NANCY ANN STORYBOOK DOLLS,"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK ON NANCY ANN DOLLS. IT HAS A LOT OF PICTURES. THE ONLY THING IS THE PICTURES ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE. IT WOULD BE A LOT BETTER IF THE PICTURES WERE IN COLOR. IT WOULD BE EASIER TO FIND THE DOLL YOU ARE LOOKING FOR. WOULD BE GREAT IF SOMEONE WOULD WRITE AND UPDATE THIS BOOK ON NANCY ANNY STORYBOOK DOLLS WITH COLOR PICTURES. SEEMS A SHAME THAT THE TOY COMPANIES CAN'T BRING THESE DOLLS BACK FOR US TO BUY. THE LITTLE GIRLS MIGHT NOT LIKE THEM, BUT I AM SURE US ADULTS WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME NEW NANCY ANN'S. I KNOW I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOME MYSELF."
4,Storybook dolls book,It had LOTS of black and white photos. It featured many dolls. Good information. I would have liked more color.
3,An overall disappointment,"Overall, this album was a disappointment. I put it into my CD player and was surprised to get through it so quickly. The album is just over half an hour and does not compare with The D's self-titled debut. I love Jack and Kyle, but I think that the duo could have put a little bit more effort into this album than they did. Two of the songs on this album date back to Tenacious D's HBO TV series (Master Exploder and History). Both of which are TD classics. The title track POD and The Government Totally Sucks are a pair of great tracks as well. This is still a great band, and a true fan will still buy the album, just dont be expecting a classic like their debut. All I can say is that I hope the movie doesn't let me down."
3,Over-Produced and Pretentious,"Tenacious D has been steadily gaining popularity in recent years thanks to Jack Black's movie success and the inevitable P2P networks that exist on the Internet. Their first album was clever and funny, but even though they claimed they were the best band in the world, it didn't seem like they let their proclaimations get to their head. With Tenacious D starring in their own movie and with their popularity at an all-time high, all the talk has gotten to their heads. This record is simply not as good as their debut, and there is an almost palpable pretentiousness associated with it. The only song that made me laugh on the first listen through was ""Classico,"" a quick run through of a few classical snippets with JB's nonsensical lyrics and scat thrown overtop.If you're a diehard fan, you will find something to like here. They still have their distinct sound, but it just doesn't feel the same anymore."
4,Already growing on me,"The first Tenacious D album just gets better every time you listen to it. This album is the same way. However, it is definitely too short. Come on JB, the greatest band in the world should release a 10 hour cd. That way we could rock out non-stop!!"
3,Same sound - different genre.,"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE Tenacious D. Loved the movie. Love the whole concept of the best band in the world, but we heard it already. The sound is incredable, they are absolutly histerical, but the music is in the same old place. Let's see a new angle next time."
4,Pretty impressive,"Yeah, the CD seemed a bit short, but what's there is very good. Some songs didn't grab me the first time around, but I'm sure I will enjoy them when they're put into context with the movie (this was the case for me with ""Lee"" and ""Wonderboy"" from the first album- once I saw the video and story, I LOVE the songs now). I only wish there was more more vocal harmony and more KG in general."
4,Only one significant flaw,"If you loved the movie, you already know you'll love the soundtrack. If you're a fan of comedy music and you haven't been introduced to Tenacious D, maybe their previous album is a better place to start- though this one has several superior tracks it may depend a little on already knowing about Jable's and Kyle's lyrical exploits. The only bad thing I can saw about this album critically is that it's way too short, being barely over 30 minutes."
3,bought as gift,I honestly do not know if this cd is good or not or even what it sounds like since I bought it as a gift.
5,great!,I enjoyed the music of this movie and now I can get it anywhere on my Ipod. Tenacious D rules!
3,Search and D-stroy!,"Not as strong as the debut, but still well worth it for the legion of D fans. You could argue it's more of the same, but it's different...the same. This of course is the soundtrack to their underrated non-hit movie. Like the first album alot of the intention here is humor, but it's also musically very good I think. Reminds me of maybe Infant Sorrow or some of Trey Parkers music, funny...but kick-ass rockin' funny. Not sure who I'm trying to persuede here. If you're really a fan you got this five years ago. Now if that darn movie didn't bomb, maybe we'd have some new D by now. ALL HAIL!"
4,"RISE ""D"" FANS!!!","It's a pretty cool soundtrack thing, (Although it's not as good as their debut), but I'd think that were would be more reviews for it... Where are the fans?"
3,Let the D ride,"I am neither defending nor praising this album. First of all I must say to those who do not like it all that much that this is just the soundtrack to the movie. Creating lengthy songs for each track would not translate well to the movie. But still (to almost sound as if I am agreeing with those same people) this album is way too short. At just over 33 minutes I do feel a little cheated, but since it was only 10 bucks and it came with a free D shirt, I don't feel so bad about it. A litte more vulgarity (meaning numerous f-bombs), references to songs from their debut and a rock off with Satan makes this soundtrack just good enough."
2,Tenacious D The Pick of Destiny,I love Jack Black but the language is terrible on this CD. It was distracting from the music.
2,Garbage,"There are basically 3 good songs on this cd, and one of them (History) D has been playing live for years. Classico is funny but really short, and the whole Devil loves Metal track is pretty good. Other than that the whole cd is like snippets of sound that aren't even songs. They literally sound like parts of songs that were cut out becuase they were pointless. Its ridiculous and I can't believe how much worse this is than their first cd. I feel ripped offDo yourself a favor and go to their myspace page and listen to Classico and History for free. Once you've done that you've basically heard all that's worth hearing here, because they phoned the whole thing in"
3,Pretty funny,"It's much better than their crappy debut cd and I liked 9 of the 15 tracks, 2 or 3 are less than 30 seconds so that's kind of pointless but still mostly good funny songs especially Kickapoo, Classico and Beelzeboss. Of course the movie is even better, one of the best comedies ever made."
1,NEVER GOT IT,"I bought this record along with the other Tenacious D album on the same day, but this one I never recieved... so I really can't comment until I got it again... Til then, bad review!"
4,Not their greatest work,"I know it's out of the movie, but it's targeted AT the movie and not just a general mush of music.Their regular music is much more hardcore than what's on this album.Though I gotta give Kickapoo and The Final Showdown the honors for the greatest songs on the album. They almost compete with Tribute and Wonderboy"
3,THE BATTERY LAST ONLY 1 HOUR OR SO,"I GUESS I WAS EXPECTING THIS BATTERY TO LAST LONGER THAN THEONE IT WAS TO REPLACE, OLDER LAPTOPS JUST CONSUME TOO MUCH JUICE TO RUN"
4,"Works great, but not as good as original.","Actually purchased this for my mom's computer. The battery that came with her laptop was no longer capable of holding a charge longer than 5 minutes. Purchased this one and it works great. It's not as good as when the computer was brand new with the battery that came with it. However, for a replacement battery it seems to be a great buy!"
5,Sometimes there are nice surprises...,"I bought this CD straight from the label offices in Paris.I came back home, and played it a couple of nights after.Well, surprisingly, this made its way to my ears with a deep sense of satisfaction.The reason for it, is nothing more than a ""fresh"" sound ( in terms of listening to a non cliche music, and a totally improvised performance) that come to me in a dense and at the same time attractive form.Perhaps if you dig in the later titles of this label you will find ,mostly, a clear World Music, or Jazzy tendence.Is not bad, of course, otherwise I wasn't open to buy the whole records collection as I did, but I definitely would appreciate to have more titles of this kind available for buying.Give this one a try.Open your ears, and do keep an eye on this label.Artwork, is a very nice work as well."
3,Nice,If you or your little ones enjoy Beauty and the Beast than they may enjoy this one as well. Though not anywhere near as good as the original it does deliver most of the original cast from the movie. Story's a little flat but being a Xmas special what would you expect right?
2,Not much fun for a Christmas video,"Somehow I think Disney gets away pretty easily with G ratings for some of it's cartoons. If you are into dark, disturbing, and sometimes violent Christmas stories then you might like this movie, but I didn't appreciate songs that included lyrics about sending characters to ""Hell"", and a scary pipe organ who decided that ""they won't be able to enjoy Christmas if they are DEAD!!!"".The themes are definitely PG material. It's not even a fun movie. You leave it remembering the dark and disturbing parts and not the happy parts.If you think this will be a magical, happy Christmas movie to add to your collection think again. If you want to watch cartoon characters fighting for their lives with your little kids, then you might want to buy this movie, otherwise stay away."
4,great gift,I bought this for my girlfriend who is a huge disney fanatic. She absolutely loved the movie. Alhtough it was a little darker than I expected I thouroughly enjoyed because it was. It's nice to see there is more to disney cartoons than sunshine and fairy tales.
1,Not Appropriate,"I watched this movie once with my preschool age daughter and it quietly went into the trash heap afterward. There is no reason for having the organ scream the word ""hell"" in the middle of a song, and the story line is very dark. This movie taught me that I even have to preview G-rated Disney cartoons before allowing my children to see them. Do yourself and your children a favor and check out the Veggie Tales Christmas shows instead."
1,wrong video,"I ordered ""Beauty and the Beast"" not a Chrisrmas one. I wanted the original. I wrote back to the seller and got no response so for $22,00 i AM STUCK WITH A product I do not want. Very disappointing."
1,"Awful, Just Awful",This was out on VHS awhile go & we recently got a copy. My girl loves Beauty & the Beast and hated this movie. She actually told me to donate it! The pipe organ/bad guy is way too scary for young kids. The movie is just awful. Boring & awful & scary. I would give the original movie an A and this movie a big F.
1,Beauty and the Beast Gets Destoryed,"This movie is just down right awful. It took a beloved animated classic and made it cheap. This movie honestly shouldn't have been made. Its stupid, badly written and the songs within the film are terrible! Beauty and the Beast is one of my all time faveorite films and this movie makes me want to cry. Don't waste your money on this, please."
3,Surprisingly frightening,"I was really hoping that because this was a Christmas movie, it would have very little frightening content. My daughter is 4 and fairly sensitive, and this was way too scary for her. There is a villain embodied as a pipe organ that she found to be very upsetting. I have to say, I could see why. I turned it off immediately, and we won't show it again in this house. I am sure it is fine for many kids, but if you have a sensitive child, stay away from this film."
2,Mediocrity incompetency at its best,"I saw ""Beauty and the Beast"" when I was a little girl, and I just absolutely loved that movie.When I heard about this sequel, I borrowed a copy of ""B&tB;: The Enchanted Christmas"" and I have to say this: While I did have lower expectations for a DTV sequel, this went below the bar. Far below. Yes, the entire cast from the original was there. Yes, animation wasn't as good as its precedecessor. And yes, Disney had to make a sequel off of one of their best films ever.And I don't even want to know what's going to be in the ""Special Edition"" of ""The Enchanted Christmas."" The cover looks far too good for a DTV sequel."
1,Scary movie,"My daughter, who is 4, was actually scared of the pipe organ. We stopped watching it in the middle because it was too scary for her. I do not recommend this movie."
1,What a Nightmare!,"This movie is Horrible! Looks like it's going to be so pretty and fun and wonderful. It's Terrible, Dark, Scary, mean, ugly. My 4.5 yr old girl would like to tell all the mommies out there to NOT buy this movie for there kids because the beast is a big crab and mean and the Pipe Organ is so scary and is a main character in the movie! Belle is trying to get a tree for Christmas, falls through ice, almost dies and the beast ""captures"" her and throws her in a dungeon! We thought he was rescuing her but HE thought she was trying to escape. IT was just AWEFUL. NOT A CHRISTMAS MOVIE! We will be tossing this one or giving it away but that would be mean!"
1,How can anyone defend this?,"I strongly advise everyone who reads this to burn all the copies of THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS that you possibly can. As a lover of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,I do not recognize THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS and never will. I hate this movie with all my heart. Please contact me if you'd like a detailed list of the errors that negate the possibility of the events in this film. I will not rest until the world knows."
1,I resent this movie's existence,"The simple,cold fact is is that THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is superfluous,unneccessary,and wrong. If I could burn every copy, I really would. If you'd like to see the Error List I compiled, detailing all the errors that were made,please e-mail me. It's important that THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is recognized for what it is-a blasphemous,uncanonical hack job that just doesn't count."
1,Major Disney Fail,"The only reason I gave this movie one star was because Amazon doesn't have a minus. This movie was awful. I thought this was going to be a cute Christmas movie to watch with my granddaughter. It was dark and frightening, and had nothing to do with Christmas. I am so glad I rented this from my local library and didn't waste my money buying this."
5,beauty and the beast,"Item came in excellent packaging, arrive on time, what else can we say about this wonderful movie, is an excellent gift recommend it."
4,Loved it as a little girl,"I first watched this movie when I was about 10 years old, as a family. We bought it out holiday shopping, then my dad, mom, my little sister and I all watched it together.My little sister was about 6 or 7 and we both loved it. (and my parents). Now 12 years later I don't remember anything extremely dark or scary. I only remember the songs and story of the movie. Who cares if it isn't 100% believable to an ADULT that it happened during the first film. To a child it never even crosses your mind.This is a great family movie. It is in no way as good as the original, but what Disney sequel/holiday movie ever is? This is one of the best ones though.Loved it then, love it now."
1,Christmas downer,"Just watched this with my 8-year-old daughter and she could not reach the Delete button fast enough when it ended. It was so negative and filled with yelling, destruction, and anger. I understand that conflict is required to move a storyline, but this is movie has only the thinnest thread of a storyline (Forte the organ wants to ruin Christmas and run Belle off, inexplicably), so the entire movie is Belle and castle creature friends trying to make Christmas lovely and Forte talking Beast into destroying the efforts. Of course it all works out in the end but truly in about the last 90 seconds. Nothing like inviting children to sit in front of an hour or more of almost non-stop hostility (with peppy interludes) and a last-second Christmas-is-saved moment. Yippee and a Cranky Christmas to all...."
1,A Disney Dud...,"This was the one DVD my kids wanted for Christmas, as they had seen a snippet of it in the Disney Princess Christmas of Enchantment.What a disappointment! Poor animation quality: strange mix of 2D & 3D, boring plot, horribly lame lyrics:""If you're turned on then just turn off""""you'll go to potyou'll turn to drinkyou'll never restyou'll end up mad and looking like some poor demented dove""Really, Disney?The only positive is the stellar voice cast, but that doesn't redeem all the cons of this dud of a movie...this one's definitely not staying in our Disney collection."
1,Nightmares Anyone?,"I bought this today (from Target) because my 3 yr old girl LOVED B&TB.; I am being serious when I say she was terrified. There is hardly anything about Christmas in this movie. It centers around a robotic, horrifying organ (the musical type people) that exclaims he wishes everyone was dead- um, Merry Christmas. She has called me to her room 3 timesnow saying she is scared. NOT WORTH IT."
5,Best Chirstmas Movie EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,ANOTHER GREAT BEAUTY AND THE BEAST MOVIE. DISNEY HAS DONE IT AGAIN. IF YOU LIKE OR LOVE THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST MOVIE YOU WILL LOVE THIS ONE EVEN MORE. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,B&B Enchanted CHRISTmas,"Disney classics, how can you go wrong for good wholesome family entertainment? Disney toons usually have messages about life. Top quality picture and sound."
5,A Masterpiece,"I am a HUGE fan of Beauty and the Beast, the original. I absolutely love this movie. One of the best. The characters are great. I love Angelique especially. This movie is one to own."
1,Scared my kids to death!,"I do not think this is a very warm and fuzzy 'holiday classic' My kids aged 4 and 3 wanted this video. Bought it and it scared the bejesus our of them! Half of the movie was dark, sinister and little one had her fingers in her ears so she didn't have to listen to it.Natch, the ending is o.k., but they only focus on like 3 minutes of happy. If they went potty at the end they'd miss it.We should have gotten the Pooh one, not this one. I doubt they will want to watch this again. Not a holiday classic for us!!"
3,"Great for older kids, but...","Please be warned that if you have little ones, they may be really, really frightened by the character Forté, the pipe organ. In fact, I was rather shocked that Disney made his character as sinister as they did. Yes, there is always a ""villain"" in their movies, but in this case, I think it was overdone -- he was just too scary. It is supposed to be a Christmas movie, after all, which in my mind means light, fluffy and fun :)On the positive side, the storyline is quite nice and production quality is outstanding (surprising for a part 2-type movie -- ie. The Return of Jafar was crappy compared to Aladdin), but I personally won't be playing it again for my kids for a few years, it's simply not appropriate."
3,Too scary for my Four year old,"This movie was, like most Disney straight to DVD sequels, just O.K. Like a previous reviewer mentioned, however, the villain pipe organ was a bit too scary for my kid. She loves all things princess and will not watch this movie again. My daughter is now five and decided she wants to part ways with the DVD."
4,a beautiful sequel to the classic Disney epic,"THE ENCHANTED CHRISTMAS is a wonderful continuation of Disney's acclaimed Oscar-winning BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, which tells the untold chapter of the fateful Christmas where Belle stole the heart of the gruff Beast.The best thing is the presence of the entire original voice cast; Paige O'Hara as Belle, Robby Benson as The Beast, Jerry Orbach as Lumiere, David Odgen Stiers as Cogsworth and Angela Lansbury as Mrs Potts. Joining them as brand-new characters are Bernadette Peters as Angelique, Paul Reubens as Fife and Tim Curry as the evil Forte. There is also Haley Joel Osment in the role of tiny Chip.The story is heart-warming, and as someone who has grown up with the original movie (and it has to be my favorite Disney film), it was like seeing dear old friends again.Do not miss it! The DVD transfer is gorgeous."
2,Dark for a Holiday movie,"We bought this DVD in hopes to add to our collection for holiday movies. My daughter barely made it through the first 1/2 hr. She seemed intersted in the beginning but as the movie went on it got very dark and for her a little scary. The beast was angry through most it. The reason for 2 stars, the beginning was fine as was the end. The majority of the movie was disappointing. Was not my idea of a good classical holiday movie. It still contained a good message, but it took too long to get to that message."
1,Belle's blunder,"Belle's singing in this sequel is deserving of 0 stars. There is a line in the ""stories"" song that is so poorly sung that I couldn't believe my ears. OUCH!""New and a bit alarming..."""
4,great addition,i liked this movie and so did my daughter. this is great for a part 2 video dvd release only.
5,VALLEJO - VALLEJO,"AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME! This group ROCKS! One listen is all it takes to become a hooked on Vallejo fan. I first saw them in Austin (I'm from San Antonio), I drive to Austin every chance I get to see them live. Lately they have finally started playing shows in San Antone! WhoooHOOO! I love my Vallejo Boys! AJ! Alex! Omar! Bruce! Diego! and Heath! You make a Beautiful Life out of Just Another Day! Your devoted fan...Deborah"
5,vallejo kix,"i got to meet these guys at a local concert here in austin. not only is their music wonderful, but they're just as addictive. all i can really say is you gotta hear it to beleive it. their sound is totally unique."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!,"I ordered a couple of these thinking that the sellers were selling the powder that is pictured and described in the description. I received my order today and lo and behold the powder I received is NOT the old version of the Johnson's Medicated Baby Powder (as pictured above) but the new version that does NOT contain Aloe & Vitamin E. I ordered from Sam's Online, so if anyone is thinking that this particular seller might have some of the old powder in-stock let me save you both time and money."
4,not bad at all!!!!!,"No been able to see them live yet, but the CD sure makes me want to buy some tickets!!! 2nd CD Sept2007 from what I hear."
3,Bought this for 2 songs,"The two songs are by Alan Silvestri who did the soundtrack. ""What The Heck"" and ""End Title"" from the movie are great. Terrific theme music. The rest of the CD is rehashed garbage. I would have rather had more Alan Silvestri."
4,"Saw the movie, Bought the CD","Shake,Shake,shake senore.... shake your bodyline.....by Harry Belafonte to Dean Martin.... Even though the music does not give you the mood of the movie.... you can still enjoys these classic songs. All the songs seems pretty good to me, but you know unless you listen to it, you will never know, like what happened to my roommate.... who bought it too.... so Check it out !"
2,Definitely not for beginners !!!!,"Unfortunately this is not a good software.1. There is no system in presenting information (lessons not really lessons)2. They could combine all 5 interactive CDs into just one! Each of them has no more than 140MB and ""Black Belt"" CD has just 25MB! So, all that ""8 CD set"" is nothing but an advertising trick!3. There is a Chinese(pinyin)-English dictionary but there is no English- Chinese one!4. Could not find any info about how to write Chinese charactersOverall, may be good for those who already know at least 300 characters and currently studying Chinese (like in college or with a native) but for independent study - below average."
1,Japanese or Chinese?,"The editorial review for this CHINESE software above states ""Start your study by mastering Hiragana, Katakana, and basic Kanji..."" Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji? Chinese does not use Hiragana or Katakana and the ""Kanji"" are known as ""Hanzi"", so goodness knows what you are getting with this software! Steer well clear!"
5,Great Software!,"This is a great software to learn Chinese.Indeed, I would have never though I will be able to learn Chinese as it seems complicated but this software had the answer for me.First, you are able to hear the language, and then it is your turn to talk and improve your pronunciation. This immersion method was very helpful.You could learn and pronounce hundreds of words, sentences.Very interactive package that I will highly recommend. The activities proposed in the software are also very good with fill-in-the blanks, crossword puzzles,..., a good and fun way to learn a difficult language!"
1,Roll On Leaks,"When I opened the shrink wrapped product, I tilted the bottle and the product ran out all over me.The product immediately created an objectionable taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
5,L.G. from Massachusetts,I think this was one of the best books I have ever read on Wicca.I am just starting out and have many books on the subject. This has helped me connect personally with my path. It is definately a spiritual guide. Thank you so much Phyllis Curott.
5,Fascinating and enlightening,"I'm not Wiccan, but my girlfriend is. I picked up this book without telling her, because I wanted to gain a better understanding of her beliefs and practices. I found the book to be extremely helpful-it gave me insights that a year of hanging out with a Wiccan never did. The book was very well-written, and I the author's voice allowed me to get a true sense of her (and my girlfriend's) deep sense of joy and well-being that Wicca provides them.I would recommend this book strongly to non-Wiccans who want to learn more about this fascinating way of life. And I think Wiccans will find the book to be a wonderful affirmation of their beliefs.To me, there's no stronger magic than the experience of reading a good book. This book is truly magic."
2,"It was okay, but...............","When I saw Witch Crafting I thought it looked serious. I've grown tired of ""13 steps and you're a Witch!"" and spell books that don't teach ethics, even give out dark spells to cowans.So I saw this, and thought it looked real, the religion Wicca, not the cheap flashy version, and it was, sort of.I enjoyed it's fresh take, it was light on the how to and heavy on the why. Not for beginners, but an interesting read for intermediate or higher.But as I read on I found it somewhat preachy and biased. These views are definetly Phyllis Curott's views, and do not represent Wiccans in general. If you're interested in Ms. Curott's tradition of Wicca then I say read on, but to everyone else I say keep in mind this book costs a fair bit just to have someone else tell you how they think Wicca should be."
5,Very good,"This book was among the best books I have ever read on the subject. Informative, practical and entertaining."
4,"Certainly not for beginners, or traditionalists, but good nonetheless","Some of the criticism of this book is well-founded. Miss Currot's sexism is a little unnerving, and I also don't agree with some of her ideas. But that's also a good thing that I don't agree with her in some areas. That's the purpose of this book, and why it's so much better compared to most other Wiccan books on the market. This book is meant to be thought-provoking, and even controvesial. Phyllis isn't setting out to change our minds, and certainly the book is slanted to her views, but she is out to make us think and debate about the spiritual aspects of the Craft in a mature way. In that, I think she succeeds. We need people like Phyllis, and people like Bonewits, and so on. We need people with radical ideas in the Craft, but who also, while breaking from tradition, recognize that's a good thing and a stimulating thing for the Craft, and helps keep it vital as the growing modern religion it is."
4,not what you think,"I recommend this book highly to the seasoned practitioner of wicca who is already extremely familiar with the basic form and structure of ritual work and has a strong foundation of meditation practice as well as a wide knowledge base of the who, what, when, where, why and how of witchcraft. It urges us to return to basic practices with a fresh approach that breaks through crustiness. It questions long standing beliefs, invites discussion, and urges us to take a look beneath what may have been lying dormant too long. A practical and extremely effective handbook, it provides a good magical workout. However, I believe it is irresponsible to market this book as intended for beginners. It is too deconstructive and controversial. I believe it could be confusing and unhelpful for those not properly prepared. That said, this book is one of my favorite additions to my library."
5,Wonderful book to any collection,I ordered this book for a friend as well as I own one myself for quite a few years. I read it ever now and again and thoroughly enjoying reading it front to back or use it for reference. Whether a practicing pagan or new to the craft and also one could use it as a compliment to studying other religious aspects. I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about the craft or is a serious study.
5,Inspirational,"Reminds you that true magic lies within, and not solely in the use of outside objects and overblown rituals. For any lover of spirituality and mysticism, the ideas coincide well with the law of attraction as well as many things I've come to learn in eastern religions and mysticism. For those looking to transform their outer as well as inner reality, with much romanticism (not hokey or cliche) and lots of depth."
3,The two faces of Charles Bronson,"In the early 70's, Charles Bronson developed a respectable career in Europe, starring in international co-productions, generally italian and french ones. Among these films, it's worth seeing two of very different kinds, ""Cold Sweat"" and ""Lola"". The first one, called ""De la part des copains"" in France, tells about an ex criminal living in France who is forced by a gang of smugglers, led by James Mason (impressive as almways), to get even with his secret past. Intrigue, violence and treachery blows up all over the film, in a typical Bronson's vehicle. A total change of pace occurs in ""Lola"" (called ""Twinky"" in Great Britain""), when Mr. Bronson plays a middle-aged man who falls in love with a teenage girl, the lovely and talented Susan George (she would later appear in the most thrilling Sam Peckimpah's film, ""Straw Dogs""). This duo provides a touching love-story, a perfect mix between experience and lively action."
5,refreshingly fresh and innocent and playful and insightful,"This has to be my favorite volume of poetry to date (yet I am still young and have much to read). I found it ""refreshing"" and ""light"" if you will, yet at the same timetaking on some real insight. My favorite poems in the volume include ""Heaven""; which I take as almost a poetic criticism OF poetry, and ""London""; which takes on issues of physical beauty. All the poems in here I enjoy immensely. Well worth your small investment. (Plus it has historic value being the first in the legendary Pocket PoetsSeries."
3,"Well-written, well-detailed, but not very exciting","There's no doubt that Sheri Holman's promise as a writer shines through the pages of this, her debut novel. She has crafted an intricate, historical story with detailed characters and fascinating medieval anecdotes.Nevertheless, I didn't find the book very exciting, and I don't know why. It just didn't do it for me. Maybe I'm just used to the suspense and sheer intellectual power of an Eco novel, and since Holman has been compared to Eco, perhaps I was expecting too much.But as you can see many other reviewers liked the book, and i was persuaded by their arguments to get it. If you're an Eco fan, however, you might be a bit disappointed."
3,A Stolen Tongue,"Hmmmmmmmm.....Catherine with a C or a K........Who cares? Holman is a talented writer which makes this an enjoyable read. However, the story became tedious at times and confusing. Friar Felix is an entertaining, well developed character, while others I kept asking myself, why are they here? The images of the 15th century, created by Holman with her vivid descriptions of vomit, pus, ooze and any other vile concoction is effective and had me wrinkling my nose at all the appropriate times."
5,"Amazing book, if you love Mystery like Eco's Rose...buy it!","Excellent first novel by SheriHolman. I loved her favor ofdetail, the little things matteredyou could taste the food, smellthe air, and almost live it.This book is wonderful andcomplete, no triliogy needed."
4,Great for what it is.,"I love a good bio, especially one that tries to tackle a complex and controversial subject like Jane Fonda (a brilliant actress). Yet, I guess what I also want is something that examines her approach to acting and the making of some of her films, that kind of thing facinates me."
3,Works fine with patience,"Having applied 4 of these for different people there is a little bit of a trick to it. First off clean the screen, be ready to peal the shield from it's backing, line up at one side and USE the little stiff paper card that comes with it. I pressed it slowly and with gentle firmness starting at the side where I lined it up at, slowly moving across the screen while still hanging on to the loose end.Yes they are sticky, and I have a cat and my nehpew a dog and cat, No problems with bubbles or hair stuck to it."
1,This product is very difficult to apply.,"In order to put these shields onto the DS Lite, you must be in a dust and hair free zone. Any debris will cause a bubble to appear between the shield and the screen. I will definitely be returning this item. Not sure what else I could get, but still looking for a better product."
1,What a RIPOFF,"This was the best deal I could find, at the current prices this flimsy piece of plastic must be worth $100,000,000 a pound.These screen protectors are the biggest ripoff I have ever seen in my life if I didn't like my DS so much I would probably throw it away.You can take your screen protectors and shove them where the sun don't shine."
5,Nintendogs DS Lite Invisi Shields,What i like about this product is it doesn't only protect your screen but also it is not really visible even the ds is off! It doesn't form bubbles too which makes it easier for me to attached it to the screen.
2,false advert and sticky screens,"The product is difficult to apply without getting bubbles under the little sheets. They are difficult to remove (and leave a weird film on your screens). The pack says you get 2, but you really just get 1 for each screen.It's important to protect your screen from the constant stylus scratching, but it sure is lame."
4,Protect my screens,"Despite the bad rating, I consider this to be a very good product. As some of other reviewers have said, it does not bring detailed instructions. It does however, have a small tab with some brief instructions on how to peel off the plastic cover that's on it when you first purchase it. The tab might be hard to see for a lot of people, but, overall I think this is a good product that serves its purpose. It has done a very good job of protecting my screens from scratches, and has yet to peel off (like some of the other screen protectors I purchased) despite the fact that I bought this product close to a year ago."
5,oneida ottawa stainless,"We were very pleased with the quality of the stainless, and especially the service from Amamzon."
5,"Great set, great value!",Very nice flatware at a great price! Goes through the dishwasher beautifully. It comes out shiny as new!
3,Newer DVD version exists. Beware of poor quality releases!,"There are several versions of this DVD available. The newest release is;Studio: Starz / Anchor BayDVD Release Date: December 18, 2007ASIN: B000WC38DMLook for it here on Amazon.This release is also by Starz / Anchor Bay (DVD Release Date: January 30, 2001), but apparently some people have had skipping issues with this version (see the other reviews). Also, avoid the other releases which are cheap for a reason; most are full screen and poor quality transfers. Some even have the opening ""computer text"" removed.I own three DVD versions and my recommendation is to go with the newest (2007) release!JM"
4,"Not just guy stuff, Tommy Lee is for us ladies too","A previous reviewer stated that this movie was loaded with guy stuff. While this might be true, 90 minutes or so of Tommy Lee Jones (and a couple great love scenes) works for me! Killer fight scenes too. This was a very enjoyable movie. Unfortunately, done before Jones was really appreciated. What took everyone so long?"
2,"Great movie, poor quality product","As with others here, I loved this movie from the first time I saw it. However, I suspected the DVD was a bootleg copy when it first began to play, and so I then popped in my VHS tape. Sure enough, the very first scene, which is only about 30 seconds long, is missing on the DVD. It's critical because the scene sets up WHY the rest of the movie is important... a telex message advising a government operative to use any freelance methods necessary to retrieve accounting files from a company guilty of [...].Additionally, the sound quality of the DVD is quite bad on my copy, starting out extremely loud and then becoming too soft.I too hope this movie is tidied up and then re-released. I wish I had waited..."
4,This DVD has a bad skip,"I grew up and love this movie. Black Moon Rising will always hold a special place in my heart. I wore out my tape version so I perchased the rather expensive DVD .... First of all this is not a duel layer disk, so a skip should not happen. Actually the skip (close to halfway through the movie) is much worse on duel layer discs. This made me mad. If I pay close to 30 bucks for a dvd, I expect it to be in tip top shape. I returned it for an exchange and guess what! Same skip but only much, much worse than on my first version. I even have a top-of-the-line DVD player; a sony. I give up. The movie is good, but be causious, most versions of this disc (my family and friends have the same bad skip on their dvd's) contain that terrible skip. I hope [the manufacturer/publisher] fixes it, because I have the same problem on the documentary on my Evil Dead II dvd."
4,TOMMY LEE MAKES IT WORTH IT BUT---------------,"Tommy Lee makes the movie worth watching except for the one objectionable scene with Hamilton.She does not do her role justice but I assume this is about the beginning of her career. At times her delivery of speech was much too soft.Her acting was ok. As for pulling a car heist? Ah, well!What a way to lose his evidence. Hey, the police hired Quint! What do they expect?Great action - darn good actors - fast enough pace for the story - Tommy Lee just keeps getting better.Might recommend but ??????????????????????????"
3,moom has risen,"this movie was supposed to be a sci-fi but it was more of an action movie if you ask me which is nota bad thing if like a typical 70,s movie it is o.k. tommy lee and linda hamilton do their useal good job in acting tthe roles for this movie i gve it an average over all rateing as tommy lee tries to steal a prototype car from bad guy favorite robert vaugn.fun but do not expect too much from this one."
3,Good,"Great experience, Great purchase. Child is a little disappoint the frog doesn't hop well but I loved the shopping experience will be using them again this year for Gifts."
3,Missing eyelets,"Good quality materials, good fit, but I am disappointed the mats did not come with the eyelets as pictured. They were the primary reason I bought these."
1,horrible,I actually got this as a gift off of my registry. it was some what easy to put togeather but as we went to put the doors on they were not even. when i brought this back to the store the manager was ike oh ya someone came in yesterday with that same exact problem. i was not at all refunded for the shipping and refused to get another one seeing it was web only. i got screwed!
1,deceptive listing,Was supposed to be a new copy but was not. Had a personal dedication written on the inside. Bought it for a gift but had to send it back. Very disappointed.
3,JUST OKAY!!,"THIS IS A NICE LITTLE BOOK & CERTAINLY ATTRACTIVE....HOWEVER, THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR BOOKS THAT ARE ALOT DEEPER & MORE MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF THE INSIGHTS, MESSAGES, & LESSONS THEY CONVEY. IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A DAILY 'FOOD FOR THOUGHT' BOOK WITH REAL SUBSTANCE I'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND ""THE BOOK OF AWAKENING"" BY MARK NEPO....IT'S A TERRIFIC WAY TO START THE DAY."
3,"Great flashlight, only one problem.......","The flashlight is very handy and utilitarian. I like the reliability. It's tough, water resistant, etc.. I must have dropped it several times on a concrete and no problems whatsoever. It's bright for the size, especially in total darkness and you can adjust the beam. Nice feature and so is the candle mode. Now, here's one problem that I have with it. I I usually carry this flashlight on my belt (under my clothes) in the nylon sheath it came with. Many, many times the head twisted making the light come on. It was after a few hours that I noticed. It's a waste of batteries. The head should not twist so easily as it does. If you don't plan on carrying it in the sheath then this shouldn't be an issue, still maglite should solve this problem. Other than that, this flashlight is excellent and the quality and materials are superb and it's made in usa. For the price, it's worth every penny."
5,maglite user,"Worked better than I expected. Super bright, easy to hold. Brightness doesn't diminish with use as with my incandescent. Lasts about 5hrs of continuous use on a fresh pair of AA 2500mAh rechargeable."
3,Umm... IDK?,"I would review this flashlight, but I didn't receive it. I got a saw. It's a pretty decent saw, though, so I'm keeping it."
5,maglight M2A096 AA cell mini,"handy size, easy to use, nice bright light brand I trust and product is very affordablewould make a sweet gift"
1,Rating -10,"Purchased several maglights over the past few years, every flashlight stopped working or corroded, ordered parts and replaced parts in the non-working lights, and then they corroded. I spent too much money on a product that didn't last"
2,Basic flashlight.,"This flashlight has very average brightness. The beam that it produces is very uneven. Battery life is average. Basically, it is the Chevy Caviler of flashlights.If you are interested in top performance, check out flashlights from Fenix, Streamlight or Surefire. They will cost more, but there is a night and day difference. A similarly sized flashlight that produces 10X the brightness with a very smooth and even light is the Surefire G2."
2,Cheap,"I bought this based on the name and the reviews. Disappointed in the flashlight, not only does it work sometimes but it's not even that bright. Most of the time I go to turn it on and nothing happens, even if I unscrew the cap all the way for candle mode I still get nothing. It happened the very first time I tried it so it hasn't been abused or dropped in any way. Disappointed on the lack of quality in the pricey flashlight."
1,"So close, yet so far away","Overall it's a nice light. It's bright. It's durable. I have owned a couple and they never broke on me. But it is absolutely inexcusable that there isn't a way to lock it on and off. I have never carried one that didn't end up getting accidentally turned on while in the factory provided sheath. Simply put, it wasn't there when I needed it and a simple little button would have fixed it and made it perfect."
5,Good flashlight,I had one of these units previously but with a conventional bulb. This unit has a bright LED bulb and longer battery life. The construction is robust like all Maglite products.
3,"Nice, but.....","Had a 2 cell AA MAG for 25 years, and decided to get another one and stage it at the other end of the house since power goes out frequently in this area. I bought the LED thinking it would be 'much' brighter and more powerful. It's not. Comparing both, with new batteries and bulb in the old MAG, the LED is only 10% brighter with its whiter colored light. It does project a perfect beam without distortion and illuminates a bit better outside. Quality is up to MAG standards. Supposedly, the batteries last longer, but it will have to save a lot of batteries and bulbs to justify the cost. If you use it 'very' frequently, it may be worth it. If not, the old style is just fine. I do prefer the slightly smaller size of the standard non-LED MAG."
1,A dirty trick,Supposed to include two AA batteries but I see I was charged an additional $7.51 for a pair of batteries I neither needed nor ordered. What kind of a dirty trick is that? Be careful . . . Amazon has apparently slipped over to the dark side and is now obviously a stinking dirty rat.
1,A lit match is brighter,"These were fine in their day, but have been eclipsed by much better, brighter AA or AAA flashlights. I decided to try upgrading two old ones I own to the newer LED and Xenon bulbs. Both bulbs were available at the box store and very reasonable. Sadly, neither bulb did much to improve the amount of light these Mini MagLites produce.I didn't test lumens or anything like that. I just added fresh batteries, turned them on in a room with daylight coming into it, and you could just see a small circle of light on the wall at 6'. At 8' they were almost invisible. Better technologies have passed these by."
5,Love these maglights,"Small, tough, and sturdy. Not the first one of these I have purchased and not likely the last. Nice and bright. Don't forget you can always unscrew the cap and you've got a small torch!"
1,2 of their products - 2 fails,"I had 2 of their products. Both failed miserably.Never got a whole lot of use out the mini because the bulb life and battery life were just terrible. I recently tried to upgrade it with an LED kit. Forget it. The internal plastic parts just fell apart in my hands.I had bought one of their C cell lights about 10 years ago. It made it through one set of batteries. When I tried to replace the batteries, the tail end would not come off. It had somehow become welded to the body of the flashlight. I think the parts corroded together and got stuck. Tried a vice, channel lock pliers, you name it. Anything that would impart enough force to get it unglued would have damaged the body. Went in the trash."
3,"Simple, powerful, short battery life.",Not much else to say about the Maglite. Great little instrument. Don't expect your batteries to last very long though.
2,poor light,Trust me it feels good in your hand but the led streamlight for 20 is a better deal.well i said it is 8 dollars
4,Very bright - it's a Mag Lite.,This flashlight is like all other Mag's. It has a nice bright bulb that can be adjusted to wide angles or focused on an object. Came with the batteries and an extra bulb. So far I like using it.
3,"Great light, but...","I like the light - it puts out a great beam, it does not weigh much, it seems to be sturdy enough... the problem I have with it is it tends to turn on when carried in a pocket. To turn it on, the head is twisted. When walking around with the light in a pocket, which I need to do for my work, movement tends to turn the light on. I have ran through numerous batteries this way, and of course, batteries always need to be replaced at the most inconvenient times."
5,great product,"Great product, only problem is there is no spot to attach any type of string to the bottom like I have seen on other models. Keep this in mind when purchasing the accesory kit."
5,Get to your car safely!,"This Mag Lite is just the right size to carry along if you have to travel through a poorly lit area to get to your car at night!This company makes excellent, reliable products!"
3,"Bulbs are bright, but have a short life span","This is the original workhorse flashlight that has been looped to my waistbelt since 1986. It's slim, bright, and spot-focuses accurately.The issues I have with this product are:a) Bulbs have a short average 2-3 month life span,b) The bulb's metal tail contacts require slight spreading prior to inserting into the main body for flicker-free operation, andc) O-rings require frequent silicone spray for smooth one hand on/off operation of the head."
2,Multiple frustrations,"I have owned at least 5 maglites and especially like the mini mag but with ALL of the maglites I have had the same problem: suddenly they don't work. When I take the batteries out and put new ones in, they still don't work. If I change the bulb they still don't work.It seems that they are very touchy about the way they are put back together. They have to have the spring situated just right among other things.I can't believe that other people don't have the same problems I do. My boyfriend just spent 30 minutes cursing, trying to replace batteries and/or bulbs without any luck. We now have 3 Maglites sitting around as pieces of art rather than useful illuminating items.Help! What are we doing wrong?"
5,WOW!,"This book is not to be missed! Beautifly photographed scenery accents the beauty of our very own Lukas Ridgeston. His eyes seem to reach out to you, even from the pictures. He is captured beautifly in his full glory! Lukas fans will definately want this book in thier collections. Even if your not a fan of Lukas and just appreciate the beauty of the male form, this is definately the book for you!"
5,THE HOTTEST THING EVER!!,"Go and buy this book, it has the best pics you've ever seen, Lukas is the most handsome man on earth and his body is perfect, not to mention his... It's a very good book."
4,All About Lukas!!!!!,"If Lukas Ridgeston of Bel Ami fame is one of your favorites as he is mine, then you should definitely buy this book. Although the book is small, it has BIG pictures in beautiful color of Lukas and fellow Bel Ami performers. The book is a real delight to the eye. I highly recommend it!!!!!"
5,This is a very good to back at your friend in high scool.,I bend trying to say this a very good book it help me get some the anwsr. To part what of life it self. I hope to Start school soon after 14 years. It beauty bring back good time and said time. I hope to complete in the 4years
4,A worthwhile book for novices,"This book is less about horse trailers than I expected. It is more about preparing the novice horse and horse-person to load & unload their horse. It does not include a comprehensive discussion on the current types (and fads) of trailers, nor does it cover the ""horse's perspective"" of what makes a good trailer. The small sections on trailers and tow vechicles is okay, but not nearly as comprehensive and fact-filled as ""The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining and Servicing a Horse Trailer"" by the Scheves.I would recommend ""Trailering your Horse..."" as a second source for the potential trailer buyer."
5,A must have,"This book helped me put together a combination of safe tow vehicle; well-equipped, comfortable horse trailer; and well-trained horse. I wish I had read it years ago. It would have saved me and my horses a lot of trouble. I have recommended this book to many people and would suggest that anyone considering the purchase of a horse trailer and/or tow vehicle read it and re-read it before talking to a single dealer/seller."
2,OK for broad general info,"I read this book after I read The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer by Neva Kittrell Scheve, Thomas G. Scheve. I found this book rather disappointing and not very informative (possibly because I read the other book first) While it does have some information about the tow vehicles (you can get more information in a more understandable format from any man walking down the street that knows trucks) and more information on training the horses to load, I still found it very disappointing. Spend the extra $$ on The Complete Guide to Buying, Maintaining, and Servicing a Horse Trailer by Neva Kittrell Scheve, Thomas G. Scheve and have a very informative book about trailers."
5,A necessary read for the lover or student of poetry.,This is the best poetry buy you can find for the money. This book is packed with more than 500 poems written since 1855 in the English language. It is behemoth of pages - thick and hefty. It will provide endless hours of entertainment. Every person should carefully study this volume before penning poetry.
3,A Decent Remix CD,This is basically a remix CD of Gravity Kills' debut album. While these remixes are done fairly well.. The originals are alot better. Probably my biggest gripe about this album is the fact that they only remix 5 songs on here.. which is only half of their debut album.. there is a couple remixes of each of the 5 songs.. this probably would have been more enjoyable if there were a remix of each song from the debut.. that way this wouldn't seem so repeatitive. But its worth getting if your a GK fan.
5,GK rulez,"the songs on this cd are great i absolutely love gravity kills, i think they rule along with my whole family, i have all of their cd's and i plam on getting their new one when it comes out in feb. I have been to two of their concerts and they were the best concerts i have ever been to. i advise everyone look in to going to a gravity kills concert, make it your new years resolution!"
4,Easy-to-read history book,This is a great book for older remedial students as well as grades 1-4. The primary facts are here with some illustrations. The text is simple and easily understood.
5,Great!!!,This book is an excellent educational resource for young readers! My 6 year old son thoroughly enjoyed it as did his 3 year old brother.
4,Childhood re-created,"Looking back on events of his childhood from the wisdom of old age, Stephen Wheatley recounts important events from his childhood. Frayn tells a story of 2 boys inventing a world around them, with the second world war unfolding around them, unsurprisingly they are obsessed with the idea of spies in their midst. Their increasing obsession with their game, leads them to some unexpected discoveries.This book is full of acute observations of youth. Outlandish games, the fickleness of children towards each other, the towering and unquestionable domination of adults over their lives.I enjoy stories where the innocence and naievity of youth is retold through knowing adult eyes and this book was no exception. Its part mystery, part rites of passage. Well written and incredibly evocative of childhood and days gone by."
4,A Worthwhile Venture,"Michael Frayn's ""Spies"" recounts a childhood incident of a boy named Stephen Weatley who narrates the story through the perspective of a now grown man. Stephen pieces the story together using nostalgic smells and sounds as a memory trigger. When Stephen's friend Keith announces that his mother is a German Spy, the boys embark on a childish game of espionage as they try to solve the enigma of Keith's mother's actions. The boys' innocence and childish mentality are exploited as they delve into issues of friendship and morality. Frayn demonstrates his skillful ability to manipulate the plot to keep the reader in anticipation, and to keep the boys in the dark long enough to keep your attention up for clues. When Stephen finally discovers the answer to the puzzle the ""world had changed forever."" Frayn develops Stephen's persona, mixed up in the ongoing wartime in Britain, through a complex process of metacognition that rings of Joycian style."
4,Very good,"I was staying at my brother's house once and wanted something to read so I could fall asleep. This is where I discovered Frayn's Headlong, and no, it didn't work. I couldn't go to sleep. I was enthralled; I loved it. So it was with great anticipation that I bought Spies.The quality of writing is about as good as Headlong, yet I expected more from Spies. There was an awful lot of repetition, and the denoeument was too pat. I had to go back and re-read most of the critical scenes to really have them sink in, and said to myself, ""Oh. Is that all.""If you want to see the world through the eyes of a young boy, and feel his angst, Frayn achieves this with aplomb. Almost a male version of Alice in Wonderland. This, to me, is what the book is about and I think I would have chosen a different title.I don't mean to be harsh; it's an excellent work and I could not set it down. I merely had very high expectations and was slightly disappointed."
2,Would Make A Great Short Story,"The book takes place during WWII and follows the lives of two eleven year year old boys as they play a game of spy. The game tests their friendship and gets one of them involved in a very grown up situation with tragic consequences. If written as a short story this book would have received four starts. As it is written though, the last 20-30 pages are well written but the first 150 feel like filler."
3,Not bad but a little weird,"Read this since my son has this as part of VCE studies. I thought it an odd selection of 17 year old boys, but what do i know. A nice twist at the end but a little tedious at times"
3,childhood mischief in war-torn Britain...,"'Spies' has a great premise: elderly man visits his childhood street in Britain recalling various spying mischief performed by himself and his best friend during WW II. The author does a good job in transporting the reader back in time and into the head of our youthful ""spy"". The story unfolds nicely. Towards the end there is some real drama, with earlier mysteries solved by our young sleuths. Unfortunately in the last twenty pages the author quickly dumps some narrative presumably to tie together loose ends of the story. It seemed a bit forced, and he resorts to the old trick of adding unnecessary/unwanted plot twists in the end. Boo!Bottom line: a genial story that gets wiped out by over-imaginative plot twists. A near miss."
2,Some songs are messed up,"Some of the music are okay, (e.g. to where you are) but a lot of them were made in a low-fi fashion. Either the recording equipment was not able to sample a broadband signal, or the music themselves were made from a keyboard like instrument. A lot of the vital part of the original music were made losing its color when being interpreted this way. Moreover, never sing with this karaoke cd if you had never listen to it, even you have learnt the song in its original format by heart. In many subtle ways, the cd kind of ""improvised"" some melody part, but mostly in an awkward way. Some transitions that it added were just horrible, messing up the beat and emotional buildup.All in all, this is a stupid karaoke cd."
2,amazing subject completely ruined,"Thomas Huxley deserves better than this meandering, plodding tome. What should have been a facinating biography is lost in the obtuse style the author uses. On the plus side--there are some very good passages and pockets of wonderful information, and the bibliography is amazingly complete. On the minus side--the shining bits are so deeply hidden in the depths of the authors quagmire style you may need a machete to find them. I also agree with some earlier posts that a thematic approach would be preferrable to a strictly chronological narrative."
2,Hip Hop Hagiography,"Rarely have I encountered such an awkward and opaque writing style. Desmond uses the sampling techniques of hip-hop, producing sentences by stringing together various quotes and quote fragments. The result manifests neither rhythm nor flow as the reader must laboriously decode even the shortest sentences. The overall result is that the book which although it has fair to good factual and analytical content has a fragmentary feel about it and is in general a chore to read."
5,.,"achingly beautiful sophomore release from one of my favorite bands. if you are familiar with the first, 17 Stars, this is a step further in a direction that is virtually impossible to classify. Mark Tranmer(of GNAC) supplies the pieces of music while Roger Quigley(of Quigley) recites hopeful lullabies. Not to be deemed depressing in any way, in fact, these songs are splendid dialogues of wishful thinking. Whether contemplating the fate of a certain relationship(World is Flat) or rethinking the course of his life(Be Selfish), Roger Quigley's voice shimmers through music pulled from a world not-unlike that of The Durutti Column."
5,i love these the most..,"i tried other brands of stainless steel measuring cups, and i have to say i now use these the most. they are so comfortable in the hand and the long handle prevents burning and scorching when you are measuring hot liquids.. love them soooo much.."
5,Well-made and convenient,"Bought this odd-size set along w/the regular set - America's Test Kitchen recommended a different set of Amco measuring cups but a lot of reviewers complained about the handles falling off of those, so I went with these instead. The handles and cups are one solid piece, so no loose handles; flat surface from handle to cup, so easy to level contents; all of these are weighted so they don't tip over on your counter even when empty. They are definitely heavier and wider than other cups, but I don't find either of those features a drawback. Each cup has a half-filled mark inside, for even more odd-size options. I've been using the cups for almost 3 months now and haven't experienced any inaccuracy issues, though after reading other reviews for the standard set I've been very careful when leveling off because of the increased possibility of ""human error"" due to the wide-mouth design. I'm really happy w/these cups, and enjoy the convenience of the extra sizes."
2,Take a second look before you buy if you don't already have PMS.,"I tried these because I liked the prenatal vitamin. I wanted calcium, which these have, and I didn't mind taking 6 a day. My periods were already regular and I usually have one day of tiredness before my period. When I started taking these it really screwed up my hormones. I suddenly had 2 weeks of pms and it made my period 6 days late(it's never that late). I stopped taking the vitamin so my period would start. I thought I might be pregnant - I wasn't. I tried taking it again when my period was over. It made me start spotting and feel really bloated again. I went back to my prenatal. I don't doubt this vitamin has helped a lot of women with pms, but if you don't have pms I suggest taking a vitamin without ""hormone balancing"" herbs."
2,Too many tablets a day!,"I love the Rainbow Light line, but bought this product by accident. I was looking for a bottle with more tablets, but accidentally purchased this one, which requires you to take THREE a day. I returned and purchased the regular one (which I LOVE) Women's Daily Multi"
1,time consuming,"I love Rainbow Light products but I was not pleased with this particular product. Who has the time to take SIX TABLETS A DAY, of the same vitamin? If one's life depends on it, then it will be fine. I definitely would not have purchase this product if I had noticed I had to take SIX TABLETS a DAY. I didn't even bother to take any when I realized I had to consume that many tablets in a given day."
1,6 tablets!!!,"When I received this multi I was shocked to read the label and find that the percentages of vitamins listed on the bottle were FOR 6 TABLETS DAILY!!!I do not intend to take 6 tablets of a multi every day. And on top of it, the amount of vitamins and minerals in 6 tablets is just average, meaning that if I take only one I am hardly getting any vitamins at all!This product is a rip-off and very misleading.Shame on Rainbow Light!"
3,multivitamin,"I purchased this multivitamin because i wouldn't have to purchase any extra supplements (C/D).. I realized that this is supposed to be 6 pills a day, which I have still never worked up to. I was taking 3 a day, which still felt like a lot to me... because......These pills taste AWFUL. These pills smell AWFUL. To open the bottle and take them almost makes me gag so I have to get the pills out and leave them on the counter for a few minutes for the smell to dissipate.Also, the pills aren't small, so if you have difficulties with small pills, these aren't for you."
4,Interesting,"I've never taken a multi-vit but after just a few days I'm feeling more energetic so I think that's a good sign. The pills smell and taste absolutely vile but if you man up and take them with something with a lot of flavor it's not so bad. They don't make my stomach hurt, even if I take them without food, so I think that's a good sign. A mildly entertaining (and kind of gross) thing I noticed is that even a few hours after taking these for the first time they will turn your urine an almost glowing yellow. (It's harmless, but that immature part of me thinks it's funny)"
5,A wonderful resource,"I thought The Cafe Pongo Cookbook was extremely well written and very informative. The author's style and the book's layout made the recipes come alive. I could almost taste the various dishes as I read and couldn't wait to get into the kitchen to try them myself. I found that the directions were very easy to follow and the dishes turned out to be every bit as good as they sounded. I highly recommend this book for anybody who lives to try something just a little bit different from the 'run of the mill'. I even gave an entire dinner part based on the recipes in the book and it was a huge success! Give this book a try, I can guarantee you wont be disappointed!"
3,swampy,"Gretchen and Clark have to stay at their grandparents for a while. They live in a house in the swamp. Their grandmother is always making too much food, yet keeps on making it, seemingly nervous when asked about it. When playing hide and seek, the kids come across a locked door they definitely should have let stay locked. Now they're all alone with....something.Nice enough but far from Stine's best.Also (slight SPOILERS here): I can buy the universe where monsters exist, but why would they keep it in their house, and why on earth would grandparents abandon their grandkids like that? Okay, it'd be a poor book if they hadn't, but it just didn't make any realistic sense."
5,This Book Rocks The House,"I'm 15 and I still like Goosebumps. How to Kill a Monster was the first Goosebumps book I've read in a while. The book was so cool. It's about Gretchen and her stepbrother Clark, where they have to stay with their whacko grandparents in ""Mud Town"". Later in the book, they both discover a monster living there and they must find a way to kill it, before it gets them...."
5,Oh Jeez!,"Gosh my gosh what a windblower! This book killed my grandma. I'd eaten carrots and got some on the cover, you could like it anyway. Scary onez are easy."
4,Wholesome Storytelling or Subconscious Racist Subterfuge?,"To be sure, this reviewer is doubtless not the first to bring this damning accusation to your attention. We, as upright citizens, have all enjoyed R.L. Stine's work--I know I did when I read his work two years ago in the fourth grade--but how much longer can we let our children go on reading these racist manifestoes? The Monster is clearly intended to represent the minorities that live in our closet as a nation. Let us protest racism, not through the boycotting of buses like our glorious predecesors but by refusing to read this Grand Wizard's racist trash!"
4,Wholesome Storytelling or Subliminal Racist Subterfuge?,"To be sure, this reviewer is doubtless not the first to bring this damning accusation to your attention. We, as upright citizens, have all enjoyed R.L. Stine's work--I know I did when I read his work two years ago in the fourth grade--but how much longer can we let our children go on reading these racist manifestoes? The Monster is clearly intended to represent the minorities that live in our closet as a nation. In homage to our glorious, freedom fighting predecessors, let us boycott this Grand Wizard's intolerant trash! This book does not rock! This book does not rule!"
4,A great addition!,"This book is filled with more information about the Hulk and the Avengers then I could find on any online source. It has a lot of new profiles for heroes and villains encountered by both the Avengers and the Hulk, which naturally leads to a few villains and heroes that have encountered other Marvel characters like Scorpion and Shocker from Spiderman. It's also got a lot of new actions, options, modifiers, and a few advantages, disadvantages, and challenges. It's as big an upgrade to the game as the guide to the X-men was if not bigger. The only thing I thought I would get that I didn't was a better description of Asguard and other magical realms. Oh well, aside from that, it's a great upgrade."
1,"If you're interested in the Avengers, find the old TSR books","Once again the people in charge of Marvel roleplaying books have made a blunder. Their inability to even give the complete Avengers roster shocked me! I intended to buy this book til I thumbed through it, and couldn't find updated stats for Hank Pym. If you're at all interested in Marvel roleplaying games go find TSR's old MSH system, while a bit old and out of date both Avengers Assembled and Avengers Coast to Coast are deeper and more worthwile!"
4,Not quite a primer,"This was a very helpful book for refamiliarizing myself with the concepts behind LANs and WANs. If you are truly just getting started with understanding intranets, you would be better served if you also got a copy of ""How Networks Work"" and read that book first."
4,If you want to do all of your thinking for yourself...,"...then this is the book for you. It contains all of the pertinant and influential work on ethics, justice, virtue, and duty. Just don't expect to be spoon-fed the learning points. It is comprehensive, and seeks to provide original works to engage both sides of issues. If you're not familiar with reading drawn-out Victorian sentences, or ancient Chinese writing, it might take a while to digest. The case studies are a high note, because they are simpler to get your brain around."
4,A Surprising Great Record......,"I say ""surprisingly"" simply because I got this cd as a buy one get one free special at a local record store and figured it would end up in the trash can.... Little did I realize that it would turn out to be as good as it is... I see that another reviewer claims The Royal Fingerbowl are better than the Beatles which is utterly ridiculous not just because it's a ridiculous statement but because they sound nothing like The Fab Four so the comparison is.... well.... ridiculous. Put it this way... If you like Pere Ubu, Captain Beefheart, Leon Redbone, Dr. John or any other off-beat artists of the like then you'll undoubtedly like this one... Very cool stuff...."
3,1996 world series high point of band's carreer,"sirs,i have it on good authority that the recording of this record was fatally undermined by the chief songwriter's attendance of game six of the 1996 world series game at yankee stadium. three days into the recording of sabo, baseball wonk mcmurray chose to attend what would prove to be the deciding game of that series. his subsequent drunkenness carried over to the next few months the record took to complete. i also have it on good authority that mr. mcmurray largely abandoned music at this time, choosing instead to spend his time locked in his bedroom with the sporting news.he is currently employed by the wildlife and fisheries department of louisiana. he resides with his estranged wife and his two children, bernard and colic."
5,"""CUBA"" ""MAYITO FERNANDEZ"" Y SU ORQUESTA","This CD should please all Cuban music anc ""charanga"" lovers, for superb director and piano player Mario Fernandez, in my opinion is the only orchestra of its kind to preserve the sound of Cuba's fabulous 50's. Mario's version of ""Clavelitos"" should transport you to that era as well as all the other songs of this fabulous compilation.If you are Cuban Charanga lover, this is definitely your CD album."
5,sweet treat for a candy loving toddler; don't eat too many at once,"My two year old has cavities, and loves candy, who doesn't? So I purchased these to help satisfy her candy craving and protect her teeth from sugar at the same time. My children, ages seven and two, and I love these lollipops. After trying my first one I actually read the ingredients again to make sure they do no contain sugar, which of course they don't.I really wish they listed all the flavors because ""wild fruit mix"" listed on the description of this product could really mean anything. So, here are the flavors: cherry, orange, lemon, strawberry, and grape.I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely buy these again.Update: Heed the warnings of others; over-consumption will cause diarrhea."
2,good taste bad after affect,I have not bought this product before and bought it for my husband who also is trying to quit smoking. He used the suckers and started having a lot of gas.If he had more than three of these a day he was in the bathroom. Taste was good but the side affects where not good. I have bought this brand in other products and have had not problems.
3,"Love the candy, not the way it came","I bought this candy for my son's birthday party as favors. He loves the candy, and I like the fact it's sugar free. I didn't like the packaging. At least half of the individual wrapped candies had holes in the wrappers and were coming out of the packaging. Some were even broken or crushed. I couldn't give out the ones with the holes."
1,Trick the buyer,"This item appears as number two or three on the list of items when searching for xylitol lolipops. I bought a bag for my granddaughter assuming that I had bought a product made from xylitol... a reasonable assumption since the item is near the top of the search. Obviously, from now on when I buy from Amazon, I will have to actually read the whole page to see what I am actually buying (facts are on the bottom of the page) My son pointed out that the lolipops were made of sucralose, a highly cholinated sweetener of which studies have pointed out adverse effects on the body (including this one : [...] ). I am angry at Amazon.com for allowing this product to appear on the search for xylitol products. It is clear to me that they hope that there are more dummies out there who assume that the search will display what was asked for, see that the product is sugar free and third on the search list and buy it."
3,lollypops,"HiWe love these lollypops, but this time many came broken and you only know this when you open the wrapper."
5,Granddaughter loves them!,My 2 1/2 year old granddaughter loves these suckers. She knows where I keep them in my purse and tries to get them out herself. No guilt when I let her have candy!
4,Great to quiet my son without adding sugar,"My son is hyperactive and borderline ADHD/bipolar. Whenever we are out to the mall or shopping or anywhere, he fidgets and chews his nails and talks and moves about and doesn't listen and can't follow directions... all of the activity overwhelms him.... ANYWAY. I looked for suckers that do not have added sugars and after a little research, I found these with a sugar alternative rather than NUTRASWEET/aspartame-- the only thing I wish was different is that I wish they had the string handles (like Saf-T-Pops). I bought them with the hope that offering them to him while waiting at the doctor or shopping at the grocery, he will have something to satisfy his oral fixation and hold his focus.He likes the flavors and they do the trick! By the way, he is 8 1/2... I DO recommend buying these if you are looking for a simple, sugar free sucker to buy yourself 5 minutes of peace from a noisy child, or to quit smoking, or when you're dieting.I hope this helps! :)"
3,"Really Yummy, But Causes Gastric Distress","These Sorbee ""Sugar Free Lollypops"" are surprisingly good tasting, but any more than one of these in less than an hour causes me to experience extreme ""gastric distress"". Being a Type 2 diabetic, I had very high hopes that these lollipops would be a good treat since I like Sucralose (Splenda), and it doesn't bother me in any quantity. That being said, ""something"" in these inflicted cartoon funny flatulence on me and thankfully it didn't hit until I was home, only exposing my immediate family to the ensuing hilarity.In all seriousness, the bloating was rather painful and I will not likely inflict these on myself (or others), so my search continues for the perfect diabetic friendly lollipops.CFH"
5,A Definite must have,"I used just a dab of this wax after the ""Restore"" option in the kit. Just a little dab helped remove so many scratches accumulated on my friend's guitar body that didnt' have a pickguard. The finish looked dull and old, before I started off, and after i finished off with this wax, most scratches were gone, with only faint lines that indicated that there had been any.Do note that i used only a couple of tiny dabs on the guitar face!! That is brilliant, and I have a whole bottle left! If i used more, i wonder what would have happened. I used a regular flannel cloth, and didn't use one of the polishing microfiber cloths too, and it does a pretty reasonable job. Make sure you put some elbow grease into this so that your finish looks new, and your guitar looks like it never did before!Five Stars!"
5,An Excellent Product,This product came exactly as stated in the description. It was received in a very timely manner and was in excellent condition.
3,My second choice!,Propet W3804 Life Walker is adequate. I have been wearing Propet sneakers for many years. My first preference is M3910 but after having two pair I have experienced the leather coming apart from the sole towards the front. I am sure that you won't want to post this but I needed to make this known. I wear orthodics and M3910 would be my preference over all of them. Even my Podiatrist approved of them.
2,Not for me,"These sneakers are too low in the heel and my foot comes in and out of them. They are lightweight, which I like in a sneaker. However, they just don't fit my feet correctly. They might be fine for some people so you might want to give them a try. They just didn't work for me."
3,A Readable Introduction to the Subject,"This book is for people who are beginning their study of medieval knights. It isn't academic, so it's a very easy read. It is logically organized and contains some interesting tidbits like the origins of certain phrases such as ""get on your high horse"" or being ""pummeled."" (These both originated with the knights, according to the author.)The book should have included pictures. For example, there is a discussion on various types of armor, shields and helms--it would have been helpful had they been pictorially displayed. It would also have been nice to see some of the castles in pictures; after all, the architecture of those buildings are part of the enduring fascination for medieval history.If this book were less than $10, I would recommend it for the beginning student. However, I feel the price is too steep. But take heart: the bibliography reveals the author did much of his research online--a free alternative to buying this book!"
3,National Lampoon's Vacation By Mark Stassen,"Dir:Harold Ramis.Starring Chevy Chase,Randy Quaid,Beverly D'Angelo,Dana Barron,Christie Brinkley,John Candy,Brian Doyle Murray.(1983) 99mins.Clark Griswold(Chevy)and his rowdy family embark on a exausting journey cross country,in search of Wally World, a very popular theme park. Unfortunately things go very wrong ,when Clark pays Cousin Eddy(Quaid)a long awaited visit on their remote farm. There is a hilarious scene where Clark flirts with the stunning,sexy Christie Brinkley at an ice cold swimming pool.There are also memorable performances by the late John Candy,Brian Doyle Murray and Eddie Bracken.In my opinion this movie,is the real deal,because we all know about holidays gone wrong,and it's fun to laugh about it once and a while ! Did you know that the opening song (Holliday Road) is sung by Lindsay Buckingham, formerly of Fleetwood Mac? Mark Stassen."
5,A good time,"Vacation is a fun time at best!!!!,Chase is funny as Clark W. Griswald,Randy Quaid is fun as cousin Eddie and Christie Brinkley is incredibly hot as the Ferrari girl,including the pool scene."
3,not as good as I remember !,"Still has it's moments, just not as many, at my age. and, there is a ""glitch"" on my copy of the DVD where it stopped, went blank, then within a few seconds came back on, in the same place it went off. After that, it played fine. Sound isn't the best, but I wouldn't expect it to be great, after all these years."
1,DVD's shouldn't even be offered in fullscreen,"If you're spending all your money to buy a superior system to play your films on, then the films should be just as superior. Fullscreen formats are for tape only. When you buy a cheap copy, you should get a cheap copy. I agree with many here and WILL NOT buy this until they put the film out in WIDESCREEN. I want to see it the way it was meant to be seen. Sorry, another lost sale."
3,A deterrent from taking long car trips cross-country,"A humorous film about a very successful, yet gullible family man who drags the clan two-thirds across the country to an overrated, fictitious theme park. This film vicariously places the audience in all-too common situations that so many travellers have experienced; it almost serves as a warning to anyone thinking about taking a long trip. The Griswold family seem to be in situations strangely similar to those experienced by the Joads in John Steinbeck's ""The Grapes of Wrath"". Anyway, the film is full of laughable situations. All the while I got to thinking ""Better you than me, Chevy""!"
3,Special Edition? Not really.,"A funny movie and one of my favorites but the ""special edition"" seems to be lacking a lot of extras. I agree with the other reviews but still bought the DVD. The commentary describes all these scenes and alternate endings that they shot but -guess what- they are not on this DVD! No deleted scenes, no making of, just some lame-o snipets of interviews and a theatrical trailer. Another odd thing: the first scene with Christie Brinkley driving alongside Chevy Chase, the song is replaced with a different pointer sisters song BUT if you choose french or spanish audio, the song is the original which is ""I'm So Excited""... that was kinda strange. Great movie, so-so special edition. If you buy this DVD, don't buy it for the extras that's for sure."
2,pales in comparison to its sequels,"Vacation is a decent comedy film, to be sure. But you may want to avoid this one and try the other, better, Vacation movies first (i.e. European, Christmas, Vegas). While good for several laughs, including an absolutely hilarious scene involving ""cousin eddie,"" this movie seems to suffer from poor directing. The dialogue often rambles and seems awfully unpolished for a John Hughes flick. Even worse, good jokes are often ruined by inappropriate music: The soundtrack seems better-suited for a video game than a major motion picture. Hardcore Chevy Chase fans will nonetheless delight at the Griswold follies, but others may want to pass."
1,deserves less than a star,this was probobly the worst movie that I have ever seen. Its not funny.Its predictable.
4,Classic Comedy!,They don't make them like this anymore! Chevy Chase was a great comic actor! I wish they would come out with the Blu-Ray of this!
5,FUNNY AS HELL!!!!,When I first saw this movie on TBS I was laughing hysterically but knew I was missing something. So the next day I bought the unedited version and it was even funnier than before. Its too bad the sequels stunk though they would have been good with Anthony Michael Hall as Rusty.
5,Definately one of my all time favorites,"You ever fill out one of those questionnaires that ask ""if you could have only 5 movies, which ones would you pick""? Well, this one is on my list. I can't even tell you how many times I've seen this movie. Even though I own it on DVD, when it aires on television, I still have to watch it. Chevy Chase it at his finest, reminding me of my dear 'ol Dad himself on vacation. Some may say that the humor is a little farfetched and over-the-top, but for me, that's what makes this the hysterical blockbuster that it is!"
4,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","If you already have National Lampoon's Vacation on VHS, or if you taped it off the Television don't bother to buy the DVD. Most movies have 5.1 Dolby Surround audio these days. Every so often you'll find an older movie that wasn't recorded in Dolby, and is on DVD in 2 channel Stereo. This movie was recorded in Mono. That's right folks, the sound only comes out of one speaker. That is almost unheard of these days. I love this movie, but it pains me to watch it on my home theater system. The sound doesn't even come out of the center channel, for me it comes out of the left. Luckily this DVD was a gift and I didn't spend any money on it. Let's just pray that the powers that be realize what a goldmine they have and remaster this movie, and add a few extras if they can."
5,Great Movie!,This movie is hilarious. Fun for the whole family. I highly recommend it. There are some unforgettable scenes like the ending when they finally get to Wally World. A do not miss movie.
5,classic,Hilarious. Definitely a must see for comedy fans. I grew up watching it and it still cracks me up after twenty five years. Raising Arizona does that to me too. Watch them both. I'm laughing at them right now.
1,no sound at all,I tried to watch this movie and cannot get sound to play at all. All other movies play just fine.. Very disappointed.
4,The Commentary is worth buying,"The DVD is pretty good it has the Commentary that you can choose from with people like Chevy Chase Randy Quaid and the director Harold Ramis and some other people talking about the film thats intresting. I don't really care for some of the other extras like that family truckster gallery thing is just a waste of time but the trailer is also intresting to. With a Remastered picture,audio commentary,and a trailer for the movie is is worth a buy and not badly priced either."
4,Start Your Chevy,"The first and maybe most realistic vehicle for Chevy Chase as his family attempts to traverse most of the country in search of a theme park. The characters, the situations are all easy to watch including that old trooper Imogene Coca who I remember from my youth. It is hard to imagine anyone in this country at least, not finding something to latch onto as the Griswolds make their debut. If all movies were like this one it would be too much to handle but a little diversion is always nice."
4,"The perfect summer, road trip movie","The first of the ""Vacation"" movies and probably the funniest of the bunch.Chevy Chase stars in this movie about a family of four who decide to take a mid summer, cross country drive from Chicago to LA to the Wally World amusement park(which is really Six Flags Magic Mountain). Along the way they encounter all sorts of bad luck and irate people which at the same time makes this movie so funny. The farther they get the wackier Griswold acts.Written by John Hughes and casted very well, there are a lot of great actors in this movie including Christie Brinkley,Anthony Micheal Hall, Beverly DeAngelo, Randy Quaid, and more.One think I've found dissappointing with this is the lack of extras with the DVD.If you've ever driven across country or been on Vacation with your family you'll love this movie. Even if you've lived in an Igloo your whole life, you'll probably still love this movie."
1,full screen? why even bother?,"i have to concur with the the majority. this is a classic comedy and they reduce it to full screen. until they wise up and give it the treatment it deserves, count me out. morons."
2,2 INSTALLMENT KINDA LAME...,I've seen this movie many times and the older I got the less interest I had in it. It has a few funny scenes.... All and all a distant 2 to the first Wally world classic. Worth watching if nothing else is worth watching on a cold Minnesota evening at 2am. The next Installment Christmas was a little better but also lacks enough said.
2,"Good movie, bad DVD","I would love to buy this movie on DVD, but only after good features have been added. First of all, widescreen. No DVD should be released without the original aspect ratio. Second, here in Region 1 where both English and French are official languages, both should be supported in subtitles *and* audio. I checked other regions for this DVD and it *is* available in widescreen with French audio. Other DVD features, such as audio commentaries and featurettes (and an improvement over mono sound), would be much appreciated. As it is, this DVD is not much better than an old VHS tape."
2,GOOD PICTURE BAD SOUND,DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE DTS SURROUND ADVERTISEMENT . IT'S DTS 1.0 . DTS IS SUPPOSED TO BE 5.1 . CHRISTMAS VACATION IS 2.0 . ARE THESE GUYS SO CHEAP THEY CAN'T AFFORD 5.1 ? THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF BUYING BLU-RAY IS SUPERIOR SOUND AND PICTURE .
3,Not too bad,"National Lampoon's Vacation is a comedy with big laffs. The Griswold family go on a vacation to Walley World in L.A. and encounter every single thing that could go wrong on a road trip. Their car breaks, their dog dies, their aunt dies and Clark (the main character) gets lost in the desert. It's a really wild film that's quite funny. It is rated R but is quite tame compared to most R-rated (or PG-13 rated) comedies that come out nowadays. National Lampoon's Vacation is rated R for nudity, sexual scenes, strong profanity and a little bit of violence. If you're 15 or older, rent it!"
1,Never buy fullscreen,"I own a home theatre, 130"" 16x9 sreen projection system. I never buy fullscreen editions. Get with the program!"
4,Chevy Chase is the star,"This is not my favourite of the National Lampoons series, but it is still definitely a must watch for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. Chevy Chase is hilarious, and the family car trip storyline is obviously taken to all extremes, but still manages to touch a nerve here or there - we've all been there. I watched this recently with some friends who hadn't seen it before, and I thought they'd burst from laughing so hard."
4,A little more dark than I remembered,The sound and video quality were good. This movie is just a bit darker than I remembered. It really takes a turn for the worse...
2,Subs?,"This is an awesome movie, however when renting it i was expecting subtitles also! I am hoping subtitles will be included next time especially for such well know and loved movies."
3,National Lampoons Vacation 20th anniversary special edidition,I needed a laugh.... unfortunately the memory of this movie was far better...I actually do believe there were scenes that weredeleted out of this DVD.
3,Not as good as i remembered,"When I saw National lampoons vacation, I thought it was very funny, especially the scenes between Chevy Chase and Christie Brinkley. The second time I saw it with my children, It wasn't as good as I remember. Movies have come a long way."
1,"Great, great movie!! But I must chime in with the others...","FULLSCREEN??I can't even imagine what they(Warner Brothers)were thinking by finally getting off their back sides and putting this classic flick out on DVD in FULLSCREEN format only?They have shown in the past that they can be hit-and-miss about this sort of thing.While Caddyshack was wonderfully presented to the public on DVD in all of its original aspect ratio glory...Spies Like Us was offered to us in FULLSCREEN format only on DVD.So for now, I am stuck saving my [money]for better things...Peace."
2,CLASSIC COMEDY.......BUT...........,"This is definitely a great classic comedy that keeps me laughing...but be warned about this DVD!! The picture quality is absolutely awful! Whoever transfered it to DVD should be ashamed. Buy the VHS, the pic quality is much much better."
1,"Great movie, poor DVD","I really want to buy this movie on DVD, but without widescreen there is no way."
4,The Mediator's Handbook,The book gives an easy to follow and pracical overview of mediation. I purchased the book as a used item and found it to be in excellent condition. It arrived in 4 working days from USA to Ireland. Well done to Amazon.com
5,amazing,"well, when i saw this film as tragic as it was it felt like it was planned ,i guess everything happen for a reason these men filming on the day the world stood still to watch this horrific tragedy. a part of history captured from beginning to end."
4,Excellent,"I won't say much, but I was not expecting too much from this, boy was I wrong. This was actually very good and well done. Very tasteful and an interesting perspective. Quality is superb, looks liek it was shot in High Definition."
5,A Great Documentary,I saw this on T.V. a couple of years ago and now I bought it to show my son when he older so understands what exactly happened on Sept. 11th.
5,"wow, they got the video of first plane hitting.... amazing, gripping","these guys where in the right place at the right time to film 911 from the point of view of a Fire Fighter, very moving, gives you an on the street documentry, feels like you are really there that day, it is live from the street as the ash cloud rolls toward you..... amazing.... !"
4,Best First-Person Narrative,"I've seen no better first-person narrative on the subject since this film's release. This was a must-have for me, and remains the most prized and displayed piece on the subject in my collection."
5,"A ""Must"" for Every School Library","The viewing of this documentary should be a graduation requirement for every high school senior in every school in this nation.""Courage is not the absence of fear, but rather the judgment that something else is more important than fear."" - Ambrose Redmoon"
5,Reminder that Freedom is NOT FREE,"I have the original showing of this on VHS, sponsored by Nextel. Great to see it on DVD. As a firefighter/EMT I was glad to see that the network choice not to censor the actual recording of the events that unfolded that day. This is a part of OUR history, as much as Pearl Harbour. Worth seeing, buying & owning"
5,Outstanding Documentary,"Thanks to the efforts of these documentary filmmakers who were there with the firefighters as events unfolded, this powerful documentary is outstanding and, in my opinion, historically significant. These are the people who were there, their actions, their thoughts, their feelings. This is the one video that is a must have."
4,I want my children to see this...,"When my sons are old enough I would like them to see ""9/11"". I feel that this film, above all else, represents the truest sense of what it was like on that terrible day. This film is so respectful of both the heroes who survived and the victims who perished. It is the least sensationalized version of the events that I have seen since that tragic day. My oldest son wants to be a firefighter and I think that ""9/11"" is an honest and wonderful portrayel of what these brave, often unsung heroes go through. Bravo to the Naudet brothers for using the medium of the documentary to bring the world to Ground Zero and experience for just a few horrifying moments what it was like to be in the belly of the beast."
5,Amazing documentary,"This is one of the most amazing documentaries I have ever seen. If a more amazing one is ever made, it can only be because something even worse than 9/11 happened, and the film crew was at the right place at the right time, just as the Naudet brothers were on 9/11/2001."
5,Excellent,This is probably one of the best accounts out on the market. This is the most griping and hair raising accounts from a firefighters point of view. I highly recommend this as a must have for your collection of this historical event.
5,Incredible documentary,"9/11 is a truly powerful, insperational and heartwrenching story of what our fellow Americans went through on that dark day in history. This film really portrays the New York Fire and Police department for what they are, American Hero's.I first saw this film when it was re-aired for the first time on CBS un-edited in 2006. I was rivited and you are unable to control your emotion from the realism of what is going on. Brilliantly edited to not go to far with the visuals but to push you just enough to understand and want to keep seeing the story.I always say this film changed my life, and I mean that whole-heartedly. This is a truly moving, brilliant film that every American has a responsibility to see."
5,Best 9/11 Documentary Out There.,"Warning! This is not for children. Seeing death, real destruction, and authority figures unable to cope with what happened on 9/11 is not for the young.With that being said, this is the real deal, what you probably didn't see on the nightly news. Great camera work and behind the scenes storytelling puts you in the middle of New York City that fateful day.If you never want to forget what happened The Day that Changed America, you must have this dvd."
4,Awesome,"I have seen many documentaries on 9/11. All of them have moved me in different ways. This particular documentary especially moved me because not only was this not supposed to be a documentary about 9/11, it also took you right inside what was going on and how those fighfighters were feeling and experiencing everything on that terrible day. I would recommend this to anyone!"
5,"Very moving, this movie helps me to never forget.","This is an awesome, moving film. It truely helps me to feel as though I was there with these men on that horrible day. It helps me to appriciate all that these firefighters did for those trapped and for one another. I watch this film so that I will never forget the price of our freedom."
5,What is was like to be there,I got this to see how much CBS cut from the show thay had on TVTo here it from the firemen on the seen that BOMBS were going off all over the building just proves that911 WAS AN INSIDE JOBand the buildings came down under CONTROLLED DEMOLITION!!!!!A MUST SEE
4,Good except for Troy McCleur!,"The inexperience of the camera work brought the viewer so much closer to the action, overall it was excellent apart from, as you mentioned, DeNiro dropping his ""Hi, I'm Troy McCleur, you may remember me from films portraying death and violence such as the Godfather Part II and Goodfellas"""
3,It is time to move on.,"This was shown in England on september 11th 2002, along with all the other 9/11 programmes. I thought that, although this was a moving and extraordinary programme, it is time that people should MOVE ON into the future, instead of dwelling in the past. Constantly re-visiting those events cannot do anything but hurt those who were directly affected, For there to be such a large market of september 11th memorabillia, books and tv shows means that the terrorists have partly succeded in doing what they aimed to do - disrupting the western world. However, in England we were distanced from the actual events and that may be why attitudes to September 11th differ so greatly in England than in America.I have the utmost respect for those firefighters featured in 9/11, but this DVD and VHS means that someone is making money out of this tragedy, and that is unacceptable. All profits made should be given to the charities set up to provide for those who lost family in these attacks."
1,Excessive Price Gouging / BUYER BEWARE,"To date there are 253 five-star reviews, very well-deserved to this poignant heartfelt documentary. I concur that the depth of 'presence' captured within delivers an experience no one else could have shared with us.That said, there is another aspect to purchasing this treasure, and my one-star is only to draw attention to my point. On January 1, 2013 this video was priced at $99.00 through Amazon. While this review will also post to 'seller' feedback, the average buyer does not generally look there.I was buying this for my Fire Lieutenant boyfriend, but couldn't justify the price. In searching elsewhere, the 9/11 Memorial in New York is selling this for $19.99. Yes, you'll pay shipping, but this 80% GOUGING is excessive for no reason. It is not a collector, nor is the $99 listing offering anything extra that the $19.99 DVD direct from 9/11 Memorial doesn't include. 911memorial.org - I'm much more gratified that my money is going to their fund."
5,Can't really say much except...,...buy this DVD. It is an exceptional showing of history. Sometimes people are in the right place at the right time. We are fortunate that these brothers had their cameras and lived to give us an accurate and horrifying documentary.
5,The most poignant 9/11 Documentary made yet!,"I watched this just this evening because last night it was on CBS again. I was thinking that they were going to censor it because they didn't know what they were showing before. good thing they didn't, because if they censored it, it would have taken away the emotional aspect of the movie. I do not like language in fact I despise it, but for this film I understand why it was kept in and not censored. Anyway I am thinking of buying the DVD that is hopefully uncut and uncensored because that would just make the filmmakers (the disc is in fact called the filmmaker's commemorative edition) upset. Anyway, get this movie and watch with warning!"
5,History,"This beautiful documentary makes me grateful that we have the ability to capture and share history as it is being made. Amazing, provocative, a piece of history like no other."
3,Does what is needed,"I like the player, it looks sleek, but the Fast Forward is very functional, it's to fast, without very many adjustable speeds like other dvd players. It's very loud too, it sounds like it might shoot the movie back out at you. The picture is fine, set up was easy, but I think I should have waited for the new sony's to be released."
2,A Possible Design Flaw,"I was thrilled at the price for the features. 1/4, 1/8, 1/2, 4X , 32X speeds with rock solid freeze and frame advance are fantastic in this dollar range. Especially valuable are the Optical and Digital outputs. Dolby Digital is a must and a great bonus is the DTS compatibility. However, (here drops the other shoe) the transport design makes it susceptible to damage. The door is exposed from the top making it prone to misalignment if it gets hit or pushed down. I experienced ""no disc"" and ""disc error"" messages (not to mention the five second playback fake-out leading you to believe it's actually going to work). I say, ""Bravo, Philips!"", but back to the drawing board on this one. Perhaps a modified faceplate on the whole unit and a thinner drawer front will better protect the transport and make a dynamite product. As-is, I would expect lots of unhappy people down the road."
5,You get more than you paid for!,"The Philips/Magnavox DVD player is a great bargain because it gives you the features of a high end player for a low price. I first thought of getting a Sony DVD player but I researched and found out that there have been many problems with Sony/Panasonic/Toshiba DVD players concerning certain discs. But this DVD player hasn't given me any problems, it has more features than the other major brands and its price is lower. Also it has dual lasers which can play any CD/DVD out there, compared to the other major brands which only have one laser. So if you want to get more for your money, get this DVD player."
3,average dvd player...save your money and buy a sony,"I bought this DVD player only because it was a great price and I have a Phillips Magnavox TV at home. I failed to do my research beforehand, and I found out that this DVD player has S-Video and not component video, which has a higher picture quality. This played my 40-some DVD's without any ""disc errors,"" but it will sometimes stop for a second while watching a movie at the same spot every time. If I had the choice of buying this DVD player again, I would save up my money and get one of the Sony DVD players, which is a lot more reliable."
5,Great book,"I'm currentyl 2 months into a seperation and this book has been my crutch. Well written and easy to follow with not to much psycho-babble. There are so many things in our relationship that I realized after reading this book, I wish I would have read this book months before we got seperated."
1,sls04@sprynet.com,"I was very excited when I got this book, but was disappointed after reading it, even though I did follow the advice the book gave. Weiner-Davis's quick-fix approach sounds good on the page, but in truth it just doesn't get to the bottom of any problems. More often than not, ignoring the problem seems to be the rule of thumb here, and that will just build resentment when nothing is really resolved. Also, Weiner-Davis succumbs to the very easy gender stereotypes that are so prevalent in the _Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus_ series. Basically, she says men are this way and women are that way. If you like the _Mars/Venus_ books and think critical analysis of a couple's problems is just fine, however, you'd probably like this book. For the couple wanting to fix the problem rather than ignore it, however, this book is just not going to do it."
3,Immediate help to retreat from the brink - not long term,"Although this book is great to help the couples that need help to retreat from the brink of disaster, it has little or no effect on the deep rooted problems that may be plaguing a relationship. Best if used with both committed to change the problems in a relationship. The one person techniques were only minimally effective and dependent upon that one individuals determination to remain married."
3,OK,"Itll work if you are still together but forget about it if you are already seperated, expecially far distances."
3,Divorce Busters Review,I got the book for my brother who needed it. I thought I was getting the fast 1 to 2 day delivery but it came 2 weeks past when I needed it.
3,Not if she's left!,"This is not worth purchasing if she's left already, i.e. you are separated. Basically, for people in that situation, it boils down to ""Do the no-contact method"" - which is to say, back off. No contact unless she initiates. Let her either come back or not, but get on with your life regardless. The only way to get her back will be to improve you, create happiness in your life and move on. That's the best way, as counter-intuitive as it sounds.There, summed the book up for the separated."
5,It only works if both people are willing to adjust their behavior,"I think this book has some of the best information for repairing a troubled relationship. I've read it. However, my wife refuses to read it!! It requires a lot of personal introspection and behavioral changes which may be more than some people may be unwilling to do."
1,What the Book Leaves Out,"This may be one of the most popular books; however, my experience with the book created a sorrowful ending. While attending marriage councelling, my ex and I were told to read this book. I had already been the one all along to change for my partner, and this book had me do that again. Against my better judgement, I changed again to effect a change, in the hopes of saving my marriage. It suggested to try something different, anything different. I say, if you are the one who has already become the chameleon, and the other person wishes to change nothing, you are working with a brick wall. All my changes did nothing, even initiating sex with him after two years resulted in the distinct feeling of being raped. No, I recommend being very careful."
4,Excellent Help,I found this book very helpful in understanding what I can do to make things better. I recommend this to anyone who wants their marriage to succeed and thrive.
2,Bad Accoustics...,These picks would have been great because of the rubber grip but the actual pick part that plays the string is also rubber! What were they thinking! The strings do not play crisp and clean. Strums sound muted and you cannot do fast action picking effectively. So a 2 for a good grip idea but bad accoustics.
3,Great picks! Except...,"I really like the tone and feel of these picks. In the first five minutes of using them, I thought 'I found my new favorite pick!'In the sixth minute, I noticed all the scraps of pick coating my guitar and strings. After about 30 minutes of playing, 25% of the pick was gone."
2,Sounds Nice,"Sounds nice. If your picking on an acoustic it's not quite loud enough. Not only that but they wear down easily, and leave rubber dust on the beautiful finish of the guitar. It's pretty hard to get the rubber dust off. It's worth a try if you don't mind getting a bunch of rubbish on your guitar."
1,sound nice but wear very fast,I bought this pick because my previous pick was slipping too much...But ultimately I didn't like this one at all because it wears very quickly and leave little perks of rubber on guitar. This one is very horrible product. But it sounded nice as it is rubber. Not for long run use...
3,good for bass not guitar,I got these and they are good for bass not guitar. It gives the bass a nice warm sound like fingers but faster speed. For guitar it is slow. I have 2 PRS guitars and these picks made the strings sound dull and lifeless. Im sticking with my red eric johnson nylon jazz picks. Not to mention these picks are like erasers that shed on your guitars finish.
3,"Good, but not for 12 strings","My boyfriend (whom I bought these for) loved the sound they produced, but they don't work well for 12 string guitars, as they are a bit too fat."
2,"If you like sticky, slow picks this one's for you","If I had to say something good, it would be that the pick is easy to grasp and a decent size.Otherwise, I found it stuck to my strings and was annoying to use and slowed my play.I play a 6 string acoustic - soft rock, bluegrass, etc. Maybe another type of guitar player would like it.Luckily, it was a cheap buy."
3,Not a big fan of these,These picks were just not as firm as I expected so I gave them away. They are a great idea and if you like a more pliable pick you might like these but they were just not firm enough for me.
2,not what I expected.,"I purchased these picks, because I play bass in an alternate punk metal band. We play drop tuning and playing with a plastic or nylon pick creates alot of noise. I was hoping that these picks would stop the pick noise. They don't make that annoying plastic to metal sound, but they are very flexible. I need to have alot of pick speed. These slow me down way to much. The other reviews I read stated that these were like rigid picks, but no they are not. Too bad as i had high hopes.Good picks if you don't have to tremolo pick, not very good if do have to."
2,Not very intelligent,"It's another French anti-establishment movie, with no surprises. A politician gets away with hiring goons. The movie implies you can't sue in France in civil court, so you have to take the law into your hands. There is much that is illogical, such as a policeman pretends to seek a bribe so his chief can remain for a while to investigate a murder. Far-fetched.PS: I also don't like the investigation methods used by the police in France in this movie--what the cops in the movie themselves call Gestapo methods. That's not detective work but beatings."
1,Choose Another Book,"The organization and the treatment given to most subjects are well below what one would expect for a Wikipedia entry on each respective topic.Anyone who uses this book for any kind of self-study is unlikely to get more out of it more than a few examples on multiplying matrices, row reduction, and some poetry about eigen-spaces and vector spaces.Take a look at ``Linear Algebra Done Right'' by Alxr."
2,"Too much theory, and confuses vectors with matrix operations","Honestly, I would have never known that there was a better way to do this if I hadn't had to drop this class last fall for medical reasons, then retake it this spring with different prof. and different book. This d____ed book goes out of its way to make things confusing, causing too much memorization, and intertwines what a vector space is with matrix operations. It really does not have to be this confusing. Further, the guy does not teach you how to do proofs, but then requires you to do them in homework. He doesn't teach you where to start from, or what to think of when doing a proof. Linear Algebra is a tough class to begin with. It is known to be abstract and theoretical. Lay does not need to make an already challenging subject more challenging by presenting it in such a confusing way. Thank God I had to drop last fall. I'd have gotten a C or a D (and I'm a straight A student) if I'd had to stick with the Lay book."
4,Good introductory text but may not be enough for the math savvy ...,"Happens to read through a few chapters of this book recently. I think it's probably a decent text for someone that has never had Linear Algebra before, but I would recommend Axler's 'Linear algebra Done Right' or Halmos' 'Finite-Dimensional Vector Spaces' for more math savvy students."
1,Jumps around and Lacks important information,"I think David C. Lay does not try to help the student with this book. Instead, he wants the student to work for the solution. This is fine some of the time, but not all of the time. I think this book was written from a perspective that most students already know what he is talking about. The examples are inadequate for the problems in the book and the solutions guide always says something really helpful like, ""Look in your textbook for the answer"". I like Linear Algebra, but I don't like getting the run around when I get lost. I am using Elementary Linear Algebra by Ron Larson and Bruce Edwards as a supplementary text and it will be the book that I keep after the course is over. On the other hand, Lay's book is going back to the campus bookstore."
2,Not very thorough,"This book is not very thorough. Most of the examples are near impossible to do without a previous knowledge on the subject and other resource material. The solution's guide explains every 7th odd problem, which is extremely frustrating as well. The course material goes much too quickly. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! It's just not worth it."
4,Constructive Criticism,"I already know some linear algebra, but not its applications. I am trying to learn on my own. I do * not * need comments for odd questions ""That the student really should look this up on his own because it is not good to rely too much on answers.""I ordered the book so I would have answers to at least the odd problems.I like the way the book asks questions that are not really too difficult but require knowing what is going on. It allows me to gain the knowledge for something I do not know by looking at the answers (if they were all there) to the odd problems."
1,Poor book,"Not a good text. Even with the accompanying study guide most of the problems are only briefly explained. Multiple choice ""did you read it"" questions, often full of hidden word traps, are not directly answered in the book.The study guide merely refers the reader to a vague paragraph and page number. This strategy ignores the obvious fact that if the reader got the question wrong they clearly didn't understand that paragraph in the text."
2,Babble,"I like Math, Not circler illogic. Took this course in 1997; while my professor was initially excited since he had known Lay, he soon simply shook his head in disgust, and said he needs to talk to his old friend."
5,These are a big help in German class,"Not a whole lot to review here, what you see is what you get. Even in this day & age, having a quick reference guide like this is invaluable for writing papers, reviewing vocabulary & dealing with the oft-dreaded feminine/masculine/neutral distinction assigned in German which is not assigned to words in the English language. I wish I'd had these back when I was studying in middle & high school- I would've retained my German studies better (this was back in pre-Internet days). I'm now a late-to-the-game college student and need all the help I can get! I've found this sheet to be consistently accurate & easy-to-comprehend."
4,i.m. pei the architect,it was a very good book for information on this man. i liked the pictures and description of the buildings and also the detail that they went into. this is a wonderful book if you like to know about the background and means to build buildings.
5,Beautiful earrings,"These are lovely earrings. The picture makes the garnets look somewhat ""muddy"", but in real life they are a vibrant garnet red. It is also nice that there is a little hook to secure the earwires, it makes them feel so much more secure than plain earwires. Altogether a very good price on really nice earrings. But all the Sajen jewelry is beautifully made and very attractive."
3,Can't believe I was so offensive in my last review......,"I really wanted to like this song, Linda does have a unique voice, but this song is a little too classic disco for my taste. Sorry. :("
1,Not For Me,"This product did not work for my coarse, curly hair. Instead of looking shiny and nourished, Optimum Oil Therapy Shine Booster left my hair looking dull and dry--which defeated the purpose of me putting on a moisturizing product in the first place. Worst of all, the product was very difficult for me to wash out of my hair--so much so that it took four consecutive washings to get it out! Needless to say, I won't be using Optimum Oil Therapy Shine Booster any more."
5,"Fast, reasonably priced","Wow! For the price and speed with which it was shipped, this was a great deal all around. Flag was decent quality."
5,excellent concealed detector,"(the installer stated that the laser units could not be obstructed to ensure proper performance.) in the car nothing is visible except 2 blue LEDs in the gauge area. the small keyfob size wireless remote control handles all the system functions, including mute, voice, LED, city/highway, etc. not yet able to evaluate laser performance since i have not encountered it. detection of k and x band appears to be excellent-contrary to some reports that it does not detect x band. (voice response identifies band/type of signal and whether front and/or rear.) will update review once i have experience with laser."
1,Don't be deceived by this book!,"This book neglects many of the most well know cults of today, and instead speaks about the 7th Day Adventist Church and those who keep the real Sabbath Day (as written in the 4th Commandment). Sunday worship is the Mark of Satan's authority (the counterfeit to God's true Sabbath), therefore making it the ""Mark of the Beast"". It was created by the Roman Catholic Church in 321 A.D. (by Constantine) and all those who keep Sunday are unknowingly following the Catholic Church (the ""Mother of Harlots"") and the ""Dragon"" who controls it. This is the truth!! Edmond C. Gruss (a former Jehovah's Witness) mixes truth with serious error and his intentions are questionable at best. BEWARE!"
3,A silly mistake for Freddy,"Freddy gets invited to go on a space ship to mars. The ship land in the big woods but Freddy and the others don't know. She how they treat the ""other planet"" HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA"
5,Best peeler I've ever used!!,"I've been A professional Chef for the past 25 years. I was turned on to this peeler 15 years ago and nothing has compared since. Every chef that has ever used my peeler would buy one. They are sharp and stay sharp, and they glide with ease. Every tool box needs one."
4,"Great peeler, misleading picture","Fantastic peeler -- slices cleanly through the peel and strips off very little ""meat"".Beware -- although the picture shows 3 peelers, this particular product is only a single peeler. There is another product from the same seller (Kuhn Rikon) for a 3-peeler set for $12. Much better deal than my single $10 peeler.$12 for a 3 Piece Set: ""Kuhn Rikon 3-Set Original Swiss Peeler, Red/Green/Yellow"""
3,pretty efficient,Peels swifter than the conventional peeler--takes some getting used to. Great price @ Amazon!
3,He's dashing!,"This is the soundtrack to a terribleArnold Schwarzenegger movie. Being a Christmas movie, the soundtrack features Christmas music. There were four new songs recorded for the movie by the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Three of the four songs feature lead vocals by Darlene Love or Lou Rawls. Three of the four Brian Setzer Orchestra songs later appeared on the group'sfirst Christmas album, but with Brian singing them rather than Darlene or Lou. Either way, they are good songs. There are also six classic Christmas songs by the likes of Chuck Berry, Johnny Mathis and Nat King Cole on the album. I should mention that Charles Brown's ""Merry Christmas, Baby"" is not his original hit version, but is rather a remake he recorded several years later (still good, though). So far so good, but there are two boring tracks of the movie's instrumental score. But if you skip those tracks this is a pretty good CD."
4,Another worthy entry,"Kistenmacher has been called the heir apparent to the strong Berlin School traditional of Klaus Schulze and other electronica originators. Whatever category you want to through him under, Kistenmacher is worth a listen, and Starting Again has some wonderful moments to prove that. With excellent sonics, one can fully appreciate the complexity of sections within these lengthy compositions and more fully see the ""sonic painting"" Kistenmacher loves to do with sequences of all shapes and sizes."
3,Great Bodies - Poor Plot,"If you want to spend an hour viewing nice bodies with minimal dialogue this is the movie for you. The story is about Adam and Eve with lots of frolicking in the Garden of Eden. Good movie if you are into eye candy, otherwise, try another movie."
2,El Pecado de quien dirigio esta pelicula,"I must say that as a comic movie it is Ok, but very poor in Bible teachings, in fact it has so many errors that has confused things and anyone who is has not a good knowledge of the Word of God will confused. Of course we are not suppose to go by a movie but by the word, but sometimes people begin to understand things by sight and then as he reads the Bible learns more, but I would not give anybody this as a gift. Too bad that the Actors were good but in this film they messed up."
5,nikon 5700 leather case,Just like I wanted it as compact as the camera. I can also fit my mini-tripod (clamper pod) inside the extra pocket.
4,Good small bag for the 5700,"If you're looking for a good snug fitting case for the 5700, this is it. It's a tight fit, but holds the camera and strap. There is room in the top inside pocket for a card or other item and the front pocket has quite a bit of room for a extra battery or other misc accessories. Belt loop seems robust and the rings for the strap is sewn into a nylon strap that goes all the way around the bottom. This is perfect for when I just want to carry the camera and move fast and light.As to the turning on in the case. I suppose this would be a problem if I didn't consistantly turn the camera off and the switch to review. If the camera is switched on accidently, the lens won't extend. Simple solution that one should always use regardless of the case.I imagine this will fit the new Nikon 8700 as well.There seems to be two models of this case floating around out there. (especially on ebay) The one pictured above is the best. The other seems to be lacking some pockets and features."
4,nikon coolpix 5700 case,Great camera case for nikon 5700 made for and fits well.Does not carry much gear but why should it its not a camera gear bag. It fits my needs.
5,Great case,"This is a great case for the Coolpix 5700. It holds everything I need for the basic camera outing. It holds four batteries in the front zippered compartment, and several memory cards in the zippered inside compartment. There is also a pocket on the outside. It holds a small, bendable leg tripod in the belt loop on the back."
1,Vol. 2,"For some reason I didn't notice that this was Volume 2 of the book, even though you were explicit in putting it right in front of me. I don't have Volume 1, so this volume was useless. I wanted the complete volume. A lesson learned."
5,A nice way to finish off your nursery,"This lamp is just so adorable and such a nice way to add a finishing touch to your nursery. It is of very good quality and uses a 60 watt bulb. We painted out nursery a dark blue jean denim and when this light is on it adds just enough light, but is not overpowering (perfect for late night changes)."
4,Great bargain!,"this books was older, but still in fine condition. No tears or no water stains. The pages were slightly discolored but it fit my needs well. The book itself gave me a way to grasp a perspective outside of my own society.. it was pretty eye opening"
4,Custer Died for Your Sins,It read this book for a class I took on American Indians. It shows modern Native American culture from an insider's point of view.
2,Works for Birds but not Squirrels,"wanted to love this itemworks well for birdsbut the squirels are bold and once used to it they don't flinchtried to protect some peach trees from squirrel invasionif you have the right location (closed off area, etc) it might work well and meet your needsbut in an open yard it doens't do well, tried adjusting the sensitivity projection height, etc. but no luck"
3,Scarecrow,Item works well but does not perform well in detering geese. The geese move to slow to set it off? that is what I am guessing. Because everything else seems to set them off fine.
1,"Great idea, but....","I have had raccoons frequenting my backyard and deck for the summer; feasting on a neighbor's fruit trees. Normally I would not care, except that they have taken to my deck for their....ah.....'excretory' purposes....What I tried:- motion detector light.....they did not care- Ground up habanero peppers in corn oil, sprayed on the deck and surrounding vegetation...nope, no change- Scarecrow sprinkler.....I did notice a lower level of 'activity', but it did not deter them completely.The Scarecrow seems to be tempermental about the amount of motion it needs to set off the sprinkler, but I think that is a function of the remaining power of the battery; I have had the Scarecrow for about 2 months, and have gone through 3 9V batteries.I do like the concept, but am not sure the Scarecrow is up to task.....perhaps I need to cut down my neighbors fruit trees...."
2,Unreliable at night,"Nice idea, but right from the first day, even with fresh batteries, I'd go out at night to test it with my hand, and it would not trigger, regardless of the sensitivity. During the day it worked just fine. I'm near Los Angeles, so the weather is not an issue. I bought it months ago, and only opened it this week, so I can't return it. Make sure you test yours right away."
2,Blue herons to clever,"Brought the electronic scarecrow just for the purpose of getting rid of blue herons, eating our pond fish. Worked for a while but the birds are just to smart. Tryed every way to get the product to work but it failed to protect the pond. Its a waste of money for the blue herons,save your money and use fishing line around your pond to keep the fish save from these birds."
4,Scarecrow scares wife,The Scarecrow arrived promptly and worked as desdribed. The first time my wife walked by it scared the crap out of her. Turned out my pool defecator was a frog. Obviously not deterred by the scarecrow. The kids think it's fun to run past.
4,Electronic Scarecrow,The product works pretty much as advertised. The device can detect when there is an animal in its area of operation but is not so sensitive that blowing leaves and whatnot set it off. So far it has done a good job of keeping the deer out of my flowers. The cats have learned to avoid it and the neighborhood kids like to see how close they can get without setting it off.
4,Works well but needs more adjustability,"The Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler works very well, however, it would be nice to have more adjustment options. Mainly the angle up and down at which it sprays. I don't have a huge backyard but it's not that small either and I had a very hard time adjusting the sprinkler head to keep the spray from going over my back or side fences and into the neighbors yards. I finally got the adjustment just right (after a couple of hours of trying) by changing the angle that the spike was pounded into the ground (or rock in the case of yards here in Phoenix). Other than that, it works exactly how it is described and I would recommend it to friends and family."
3,Over watering can be its own problem,"Had a huge problem last year with racoons pulling up new plants to get at slugs and worms in my garden. I swallowed the financial pill to deploy the Contech Scarecrow, and it did the trick for a while, but the racoons started to get even more clever about how they approached their target plants, they didn't seem to mind the soaking, and that part of my yard turned into a serious bog over the span of a week. This didn't make the plants too happy either!Finally gave up on the sprinkler and installed a FidoShock electric fence and have never had a problem since . . ."
5,It really works,Next door is three big dogs that stays inside except about three times each day they let them out to do their business on the nearby lawns.Since I got my Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler and they do not get on my lawn any more.I have tried electronic motion sensers and they did not work.I think the Scarecrow Sprinkler is the best thing since sliced bread.
1,a crop,"A waste of my money. It will go off if a car or person passes by, but won't go off if cats or squirrels come near it and that was what I thought it would do."
3,not real acurate,i wanted it to use to keep my cats out of the flower beds. it works sometime and most of the time it does not. it is really useless if it is designed to keep cats away. because i need it to work every time not 30 percent of the time.
4,Fun to watch,Primarily used for cats.Doesn't detect very far BUT sure scares them when it does.Great to scare unwanted human visitors and trick or treaters.Haven't had so much fun in years watching people get squirted.
4,The Scarecrow works,"The Scarecrow does a good job of keeping our dogs out of the garden. They learned to stay out in only a couple of days. It's a bit overpriced, in my opinion, but Amazon's price is as good as any on the Internet."
5,Run away little deer,"I've got major deer problems in my suburban home. Countless dollars have been spent feeding the little critters with a buffet of Garden Plants and Shrubs. This product is the first product that I have found that keeps the deer out of the plants. I've tried sprays and fencing and both of these have failed fairly quickly or in the case of sprays, just faded too fast. This sprinkler however has seemed to keep them at bay. Seems to work pretty well, but you can't use it for sprinkling, its only works when something sets it off. The bursts of water are fairly short, but startling enough that it gets me running out of the area when I forget to turn it off. It is a directional device in that you must aim it where you want to detect the movement, so its tough to protect a whole big area.I've been very happy with the product. Hopefully the deer won't outsmart me again and figure out how to disengage it. They are sneeky. Also, the neighborhood kids seem to enjoy it."
5,motion activated sprinkler,"The Scarecrow is great. We kept having creators dig around our backyard at night.The Motion-activated Sprinkler works GREAT to run them off. No chemicals or repellents, just water.Great product."
1,The scarecrows leak !,"We have used scarecrows to protect our flower beds from deer for many years and recently bought two from Amazon to replace the old ones that wore out. The new scarecrows leak and the leaks are coming from the scarecrows, not from the hoses. Should we return them? Is there a warranty? Has anyone else had this problem? Please send suggestions!"
3,effective but it leaks,"I purchased the scarecrow based on the number of good reviews it received.The first thing I did was to put teflon tape on all of the threaded pieces. It didn't work, I still get a constant drip which turns into a puddle in fifteen minutes.Mechanics aside the unit does work. I had an evolved woodchuck that would rather climb over a 2 foot fence then dig under it. This animal wiped out a six foot row of Bok Choy in about three days,no wonder they're fat. (I'm thinking the almost extinct evolved asian climbing woodchuck)Since I put up the Scarecrow I noticed he has turned his attention to my neighbor's clover. My vegetable garden is sixteen by twenty-four feet and the unit covers it easily."
1,Rabbits think it's hilarious,"Maybe this product is effective with deer, dogs or other enemies of the lawn, but rabbits just laugh at it. On Saturdays they actually seem attracted to it ... maybe because it's bath day. It does a great job scaring the cheese out of neighbors walking thier dogs and when aimed towards the street the Scarecrow never fails to go off with every passing car, even set at halfway. But even at full sensitivity it's more likely to react to the wind than a rabbit dancing a couple of feet in front of it. If you're trying to shoo away rabbits, save your carrots. The Scarecrow is worthless."
2,Scarecrow,"Not very pleased with my purchase. First of all I was very surprised when it arrived and was about 16"" long after assembly. Pictures were very deceiving. It's motion sensing function and range is good as is the sprinkler head design. It's construction is very flimsy and continues to leak constantly which creates a puddlling problem wherever you place it in the garden."
5,Works well!,"We got this sprinkler to keep animals out of our newly planted wildflower patch. Now that we have it, we have all kinds of new plants growing. It does the trick!"
4,Believe it worked,Had a neighborhood cat using my flower bed for a toilet and had killed several of my flowers.Got this sprinkler and haven't seen any gift from or smelled anything more from the cat. Still see him walking the neighborhood...but not in my yard anymore.So I believe it works.
2,Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler,"Motion activated sprinkler worked great for three weeks, then it would only activate when you stood with a foot of it and finally stopped working all together.I would not waste my money on this product."
4,"Great for animals, but attracts kids instead!","So far it has worked on the neighborhood cats but instead the kids in the neighborhood congregate in my yard to play! I look out the window and I see kids running back and forth in front of it just for fun. (Without permission, of course!) The batteries could not possibly hold up more than a few days if this keeps up!Do they make a kid repellent too???"
5,I've been crowed!!,This is the third replacement crow I have purchased over the past several years. I have paid almost twice the price elsewhere. It may be the method in which I store the crow but I seem to get about two seasons out of it. The drunken Chicago squirlles keep it very busy. I wouldn't have a garden left without it.
4,"I love it, just one little problem","I love the electronic scarecrow! What a novel concept so you don't have to build an ugly fence around your garden. It waters the plants, too, everytime it senses motion. The only problem I've had with it is that it leaks water because there is constant pressure since the water is always on. I have all of the washers in place, but there is still a constant slow drip. I bought a new, heavy duty hose, hoping that would help, but it hasn't."
5,scarecrow motion-activated sprinkler,"I recently moved into a house that has 8 cats living across the street. They insisted on using my flower beds for their litterbox. I tried all the ideas I saw online but none worked. I was at the end of my rope when I googled motion activated sprinklers. I chose item#cro101 and I LOVE it! I have had it in my flower bed for a month and I have only had a cat try 2 different times without sucess, they get scared and run away as soon as the sprinkler comes on. I highly recommend this product."
5,Excellent but get the correct timer,"This product works perfectly for my needs (deer). Amazon and other reviewers recommend the Orbit timer as an accessory. For me a timer is a must because I did not want to manually turn it on and off each time someone was going to be in the yard.The problem with the Orbit timer is its on mode is for a maximum of 6 hours a day. Since deer typically forage from dusk to dawn, the 6 hour period was not acceptable. To make it worse, since the product was not defective I had to pay for the returning freight.I found a 12 hour timer elsewhere.Update: Orbit does make a digital timer that has a longer duration."
2,DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK,DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK / AS ADVERTISEDWILL ACTIVATE WITH LARGE OBJECTS... SOMETIMESDOES NOT APPEAR TO WORK FOR BIRDS OR SMALLER ANIMALSLARGE & SLOW MOVING ONLYDO NOT SUGEST PURCHASE
4,Functions as described,"This sprinkler works very well for keeping my cats from ""fertilizing"" my vegetable garden, plus it is HILARIOUS to watch people and animals unknowingly enter the guarded zone. I almost wet my pants from laughing so hard when my boyfriend tried to set it up without reading the directions. Great product so far."
2,scarecrow sprinkler,"had high hopes for this as a cat deterrent..but after 2 days of hearing and seeing it go on/off i was dissapointed.I would sit there watching it go ON but no animals or anything around my yard?Then i would wave a broom in front of it...and NOTHING....usually.Not sure why it had a mind of its own, i was very hopeful but dissapointed.I would have given it a 1-star, but Amazon had it for almost 1/2 the cost of Homedepot and other web sites and the return policy seemed very user friendly so i bummped it up to 2-star for that reason alone.good luck with yours if you buy one.steve / N.California"
2,no go for me,"This looks like a well built sprinkler. It seems to work for a lot of people, but it did not work for me. The motion sensing was unreliable even at its most sensitive level. The squirrels were undeterred and they continue to plague my garden."
3,Not great for raccoons,"I've bought several of these. They don't work very well for raccoons. The real problem is that the angle at which the water sprays out is very high, so it goes right over their heads. The sound startles them at first, but doesn't get them. You can take out the riser pipe so the whole thing sits closer to the ground, but that doesn't change the angle. There is an adjustor that is supposed to reduce the angle, but all that does is move something in place to interfere with the water stream, so it's a bad solution.I keep buying these because there's not a great alternative, but the high fixed angle is a serious design flaw."
1,Not so great and a waste of my money,"I wanted this to work so bad. I even set up two. I fought with them all summer because as low as I could set them to keep them from going off all the time for nothing, the deer still ate my tomatoes. I cannot afford to buy batteries at the rate it eats them up and even if I had a charger, just the work of dealing with it constantly makes it not usable for me. I think two fences five feet apart will be my only answer but I don't know if growing a few veggies is really worth that. I may be good though for just teaching the neighborhood pets a lesson if that is your problem. The deer here in Paradise have found it to be their paradise so maybe my problem is just extreme, I don't know."
3,Better in the Light,"The Contech CR0101 motion activated sprinkler system was easy to set up. Had some trouble getting the motion detector to work, it was just past dusk and my hand was 2-6 inches in front of the sprinkler."
3,Great - but tricky with thread stripping,"Hello, I enjoy each aspect of this product EXCEPT that the threading between the sensor/sprinkler unit and the hose post is stripping. I hand-tighten only enough to stop leaks, but they start up - probably due to the vibration that ensues when the sensor starts the sprinkler. Are there more heavy-duty parts for that connection? I would LOVE to rank this with FULL STARS."
5,Awesome,"I bought two of these to keep my cats from using the planted area near my pool for a litter box. These would scare away coyotes I think, maybe burglars too. They do keep the cats out, however, our dogs tries to attack back and has bitten them several times. They still work, but, have to be re adjusted when he knocks them out of position.I just might buy a couple more to keep the door to door solicitors away."
4,this worked for dog training,We had the unfortunate problem of doggies pooping on the sidewalk. This really helped stop that problem since our pups are waterphobic!
3,Works sometime,"Sometimes this unit does not ""see you"", even after intstalling a fresh battery. When it works, it does a good job. Contacted factory, they said to dis-assemble and clean, made no difference."
4,Contech CR0101,Works in accordance with literature. Fittings need to be wound with plumbers tape to achieve a decent non dripping seal.
4,works fine,stopped the animals from getting in my garden and watered at the same time. Can use for children playtime also.
3,You get what you pay for,"This is basically a low end sprinkler married to a motion detector. That said, it DOES work and for the money I can't complain. If it lasts two years I'd be content"
4,Scarecrow-great device,"I recently purchased a Scarecrow sprinkler to repel deer that decimate our gardens each Summer. It works great! It ambushed deer...and me the first day. My problem is finding a hose timer that will turn the unit on in the evening and off in the morning, as that is when the deer problem is the worst. Most timers only have a ""run time"" of up to 2 hours. I would definately recommend this as a humane pest controller."
5,Works Great!,"I purchased this sprinkler to keep a Blue Herron (who ate several of my large koi in 1 sitting) away from my pond. I've had it set up for about 2 weeks now and so far...no lost fish! Works like a champ! Also, I had to give up my veggie garden because of the deer. This product works so well, I'm considering purchasing a 2nd sprinker and start growing my veggie garden again!"
4,Scarecrow works for us,"We purchased the Contech Scarecrow from Amazon after reading numerous reviews. We have been very pleased with the Scarecrow. For the last couple of years we have had trouble with the neigborhood cats using our backyard for their ""pit"" stop. We bought the Scarecrow out of frustration since nothing else seemed to keep the cats away for very long. We set the Scarecrow up about three months ago, and no longer have evidence of any cat deposits left on our lawn! The only problem we had in the setup was a leak at the juncture of the hose to the Scarecrow. We found out the leak was due to a cheap hose with a flimsy connector, and, once we replaced the hose with one with a more substantial (brass) connector, we had no further leak problems. Would definitely recommend the Scarecrow for getting cats to move on to greener pastures."
5,Keeps the deer away,"I bought one of these and when I seen how well it worked, I bought two more. They really do keep the deer away from my plants. My azaleas were in bloom this spring and I didn't have to place nets over them. In fact, the deer have learned to walk around the perimeter of the yard as not to set off the scarecrow. Once I set up the scarecrows, I left them in place. I may have to move them around some next year just to keep the deer wondering. I do get sprayed myself sometimes but it is kind of fun. I learned that if I run fast enough, I can get by them before they spray me.I do wish they had a larger/wider sensor to pick up movement over a wider area of the yard.I'm not complaining though, these are so much better than anything else I've tried. Too bad I can't use them during the winter!!"
4,Bought another one,"These work great ...I couldn't wait to get it set up as soon as it arrived. I used a LESS than fresh 9v battery and it worked OK. Within 2 weeks it was less than reliable, as a matter of fact it wasn't working at all, most of the time. I got out the owners manual and began to trouble shoot the symptoms. First off a new copper top battery, next a towel to dry off my face, finally I fired up the laptop and ordered another one. My problem was a dead battery, that was about a month ago. Since then I've installed a second scare crow sprinkler and they both work great.I would give 5 stars but they are kind of pricy, so I dinged the review a little for quality ..... its all plastic,"
4,Scarecrow Keeps the Blue Heron Away,"This is the second Scarecrow we've purchased. Have found nothing that keep the blue heron away from our pond and koi that works better than this. The heron doesn't seem smart enough to get used to being sprayed by the water when he approaches the pond. Humans forget it's there, too, sometimes and I've been sprayed and drenched by it. Takes a 9volt battery, which in our case, needs to be replaced once a month or so, but it will depend on your level of usage."
3,Not worth the money if you need to scare rabbits,"I purchased this item to scare rabbits in my lawn. It only works if it's really low otherwise the sensor will not sense the rabbits. I did put it on a lower side of the lawn, and it sprayed rabbits several times, but it scared birds more. Rabbits got used to it, so they couldn't care less. I give it three stars for that short period of time because it broke before summer was over :(( It lost the color from the sun, and the sprinkler on top broke, it only sprays on one side.It was however fun to watch my son playing in the yard in those hot days, he liked the sprinkler the most.A little advise, if you want to get rid of rabbits, buy a big bag of black pepper, sprinkle over your garden/lawn, and rabbits will never come back. You may need to re-sprinkle a few times if it rains, but rabbits will get the message. It worked for me."
4,Product simplicity and ease of use.,"The scarecrow is a simply easy to use design concept. The instructiions were clear, it was easy to put together and it works as claimed to do the job. Several persons have told me they work for small animals, and also deer. Recommended to anyone looking for protection in these circumstance."
4,keep the deer away,"I HAD BOUGHT THIS MOTION SENSOR SPRINKLER TO SCARE THE DEER FROM EATING ALL THE BUDS OFF MY FRUIT TREES, AS OF NOW IT DOES REALLY WELL. IT HAS A WIDE AREA THAT IT COVERS AND I HAVE SIX TREES IN A ROW AND IT COVERS ALL OF THEM ENOUGH SO THAT IF ANY DEER EVEN GET CLOSE TO THEM IT WILL GO OFF."
3,Works Temporarily,"I bought this because of deer problem in my yard eating away my hibiscus plants. Initial installation did not deter them so I made several adjustments and tweaks with sensitivity, position, height, etc. during a course of 2 weeks. Finally, when things doesn't seem to work I placed them right beside the plants which protected 2 of the 3 plants (the ones nearest to the Scarecrow) and the other still got chewed on. This worked only for a few days and them deers are back at it again this time getting smart and going in the side or back way! The only thing that's protecting my plants at this time are the FABRIC SOFTENERS that I hanged in each of the plants and its doing it effectively day and night. Even if it rains, those fabric softeners still work. So, instead of spending $50 - $60 on this unit, I would just spend it on fabrics softeners that's more effective and also lasts."
1,what happened to this product???,"I bought two of these a couple of years ago and they have been awesome. I bought two more recently and they worked great for about a week and then gegan only working about 1 out of every 10 ten times something entered their path, including me walking by or my kids playing right in front of them. I changed batterys a number of times, cleaned out everything I could and nothing. Also these two new ones leak a lot. I get the leaks to stop and then within a day or two there is another leak. really disappointed."
2,Not very good,Sprinkler would not always activate by motion. When weather was above 90 sometimes it would turn on/off without any motion detected. The unit leaked water slowly. I returned for credit.
2,Doesn't work on herons and buzzards,"Purchased 2 Scarecrows to keep herons and buzzards from sitting on the top of our lanai screen (Florida) and the buzzards from poking holes and pulling out the screening. Installed above the lanai. The wind sets off the sprinkler, but the birds just sit there(right in line with the sensor) and the sprinkler doesn't go off. Changed angles and sensitivity, but had 4 herons on the lanai cage again this morning."
4,"kept the deer away, but broke","This product worked great in chasing the deer away at night, what it was designed to do. Other reviews are accurate that the battery can die quickly if left on all the time. Unfortunately, the fittings are made of cheap plastic and the head snapped off in my hands when I was pushing it into the ground. Its my own fault, but I wish it was a little more durable since it is made to sit in your year and not in box with packaging around it."
4,Goodbye Cats!,"As a breeder of birds in a rural area with a ridiculously high cat population - I seriously needed a humane approach to deterring feline visits for ""snacks"". This unit works like a dream... the only enhancement required to its ""out of box"" function (designed to be ""freestanding"" on a spike) was to use a bit of shaped timber and plumbing elbows to secure it permanently to a fence which was my personal preference/requirement and maybe something that could be a design consideration if revised. Great product otherwise."
5,Keeps the big birds away,I got this to scare off a pesky heron that ate some of my expensive Koi. I haven't had any more fish missing since it was installed. I would recommend to anyone that is trying to keep pests away from your pond. Just make sure and turn it of before you walk in the line of fire or you will be taking a bath.
4,Works well during the day,"Has been keeping the neighborhood cats away during the day time, but obviously not at night, so they're still invading our yard and defecating. Occasionally, you have to check the connections for leaks. The connections become loose from the frequent jarring when the sprinkler head is activated."
2,Won't work in small area or for raised bed garden.,"This could not detect anything in my raised bed garden unless I raised it. So I put it in the garden so it would be level but then it wouldn't detect at that distance, only further out. This would work in a large level area, but if your yard is not flat, I don't think it would work. Sometimes wouldn't detect if you stood right in front of it. Unreliable. Need something to keep the cats away, but this won't work in my yard. It has to be far away from the area you are protecting to detect anything."
4,sprinkler,serves the purpose of keeping racoons and/or skunks out of fishpond. easy to turn on and off. use it with dual hose connection to faucet.
4,No more deer problem,"Deer have been a serious problem here. Herds of 20 or more are common. We tried to keep them out of the garden using some vile smelling stuff. It worked sometimes.We bought the Scarecrow, although we doubted that anything other than a high fence would be really effective. We were very surprised that the scarecrow works so well. We have had zero deer damage for two years.For smaller animals, rabbits and groundhogs, it has been partially successful. We have it set fairly high to detect der so the smaller animals sometimes are not noticed by the scarecrow.I am buying a 2nd scarecrow to provide better coverage."
3,good but leaks,I have a small vegetable garden that the deer and rabbits love to get into. Didn't want to invest in building a fence so the Scarecrow seemed like a good idea. It really is a good idea. And it works. But I guess the plastic it is made of is not the best quality. I have had a heck of a time with it leaking. I leave it on most of the time because I never know when the deer need a snack. But if it constantly leaks it wastes too much water. ($$$). My dad put that thin plumbers tape on when we set it up a couple of weeks ago....before screwing the pipes together. It helped. Then my husband had to put more on last night because it was leaking again. The Scarecrow does work. Found deer hoof prints in the garden a couple nights ago but they hadn't eaten anything - which means the Scarecrow scared them off. But I had to give it a 3 star because it is really not a good product if you can't get the leaks to stop.
5,Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler,"I was very pleased with the scarecrow it worked really well, especially liked it when my granddaughter got caught and soaked by it."
4,Contech CRO101 Scarecrow,I have not completely install it but tested it out and it works. Make sure to use heavy duty good pipe/hoses to connect or it bursts while you away from home. Turn off and drain in winter. The drawback_can not use in winter though in VA.
3,come without hose connector,Unfortunately this product cones without a hose connector and I still have not found the right connector for this from my simple (fits everything) Hozelock garden hose. We managed to fit it somehow (making a connection fit by altering it) but I am not happy to leave it on unattended which defeats the object. When it is on it works great and has caught us out several times. Quite some fun trying to dodge the short spray as it has a good range and can be adjusted as well. Cats in our garden are not impressed and you need to turn it off when you hang your washing out. Does the job if you can find the correct connection and should say this clearly in the products description. Would be easy for the manufacturer to add a few standard connection types oe offer a connection for Hoselock or is this system only used in the United Kingdom?
3,scarecrow does work,"I bought 2 Contech Cr9101 Scarecrows for my large pond. The do work as advertized, they do scare away Herons. With one of them I had a little trouble with it leaking from the hose connection. I was afraid to tighten it anymore because, it is made of plastic, I felt that it would break. For a few more dollars the Scarecrow could have been made of metal. I am, also, worried about the sun attacking the plastic because, it is exposed to the uv rays all the time."
3,2 stars off!,"I got my Scarecrow today. I took off one star for it not looking like it was supposed to, they say the bright yellow and bright eye will scare... mine came all black. I took another star off for the horrible leaking mess it is, I should have take off two stars but its the holidays. So over all I gave it 3 stars, now lets see if it will do anything besides getting me upset and wet. :-)Bill in Las Vegas"
3,The product works like it should.....,The product works like it should but over time I simply noticed the animals learn where the device can be triggered. Once they started leaning where it could be triggered I started moving the Scarecrow around the yard. Once again the animals became smarter and started learning quicker. I would like to see this product go a little further in design by making a plug in unit that works with multiple sensors so It can cover a greater area.
3,didn't keep the deer away but the grandkids love it!,works as advertized connect to hose turn water on run fast smile scream shiver run some more go back for more
5,Night Time Trouble Makers,"Those little night time diggers, I hope they dont mind getting wet. it works greatand the grass gets watered at the same time."
4,pretty darned good product,"My wife and I live in the woods and we are avid gardeners. We didn't like putting fences up and the Scarecrow is the only product that has been effective in protecting our Oriental Lilies. Sadly, the Scarecrow only had a life of two years. This year, the ravenous creatures have even acquired a taste for Hostas! Even though the Scarecrow stopped working this Spring, I'm going to buy two more for next season."
3,Scarecrow DOES NOT work for groundhogs (woodchucks),"I bought four of these - each time thinking that if only I could 'fence' my vegetable garden completely, it would keep the groundhog away. I finished installing the final scarecrow last night, and got up early this morning to watch my fence in action. Lo and behold, the critter showed up and the sprinkler went off - actually two of them did - but the groundhog was not intimidated. It proceeded right into the garden and began to chomp away, cool as a cucumber. I went out, and it took off. About two hours later, my wife saw it in the lettuce bed.I have returned all four units, as I felt the product description was quite misleading."
5,Most effective and practical solution for keeping wildlife out of the garden,"For any price, this is the most practical and effective way of keeping wild-life out of the garden outside of putting up physical barriers (ie fences, screens, etc). Spend the 10-15 minutes after setting up to adjust the sensitivity and range of coverage. I have personally seen animals as small as rabbits and large of deer being sprayed when approaching the garden within a range of 3-10 feet."
5,Works great!!,"After reading other reviews on the SCARECROW.... we bought two!! They work perfectly and keeps our very large yellow lab out of the roses and shrubs where he loves to dig. Yes, the scarecrow will keep you out too!! Great product to deter animals from the area you choose."
3,WORK FOR A WHILE,WORK INTIL THE ANIMALS GOT USED TO IT THEN IT STOPPED WORKING FOR ME ANYWAY SO BUY IT IF YOU WANNER TRY IT
4,a good buy,"i purchased this to protect my bird feeders from my neighbor's cats. I have all indoor cats. I love cats, birds and all wildlife so I needed a humane way to keep the neighbor's cats away and this product did the job nicely. I only gave it 4 stars as it's not 100% effective (what is?). I purchased two to catch them from either direction - but sometimes they just fail to detect the cat's motion. Now winter is coming and I'm thinking a fence guard and the contech ultrasound cat deterrentContech CatStop Ultrasonic Outdoor Cat Deterrent. I wish I could catch the little hunter and put a bell on her too! Of course the sure-fire way to deter the cat is to stop feeding the birds ... But I wont give up feeding my birds until I am out of options! = )"
4,FUN WAY TO CHASE PESTS !,"My scarecrow is great fun. I have it in line with my back window so I can see the results! It's hilarious to watch the squirrels try to avoid getting wet. If you are really mean, you can bait it with peanuts or pistachios that didn't open.You need to secure the hose fittings so you don't waste water, and it's a bit tricky to aim, but this can be overcome by trial and error.DON'T FORGET TO TURN OFF YOUR HOSE WHEN ADJUSTING FITTINGS,OR YOU'LL BE THE ONE GETTING WET. I can't wait for warmer weather to hook mine up for the season.Those bushy-tailed lawn wreckers had better beware !If you can afford it, two that would aim a 'V' shaped pattern on your lawn would be ideal. For the money, you can't buy more fun than a scarecrow or two."
4,Remote Sprinkler Activation,"Here's a tip: Replace the sprinkler head with a 1/2"" MPT hose bib (faucet) then put a sprinkler at the end of a garden hose where ever you need it.I needed to locate the ScareCrow away from the street so it didn't trigger on every passing car, but that didn't allow the sprinkler to reach where stray cats like to do their business. I now have a sprinkler placed about 30 feet away from the ScareCrow to cover a larger area without either soaking our front door or wasting water on the street. (A 1/2"" MPT to hose adapter will also work.)"
5,"Scarecrow works well, keeps neighbor out of my yard!","I read some other reviews, about keeping rabbits and raccoons out.(Actually, I see rabbits out there at night and think it is SKUNKS that dig up the lawn for grubs,) ANYWAY, unfortunately, we had a nasty 2 legged pest, that would cut or ruin my plants when we are away.Now I have this wonderful Scarecrow, and we now have inferred cameras and also film while away, course would be fun to catch the scarecrow in action.Down side, yes, it HAS caught US a few times, and the gas man.But it works well, great invention!Gardening and growing in Warren MA."
3,easy to use,"This device was very easy to set up and use. The sensor seems to detect better just to each side of center. I could not adjust the water spray as low to the ground as I wanted, so I turned down the water pressure a little. Otherwise, it seems to be working and I haven't lost any more koi...... yet."
1,Squirrels can relax,"This product, although nicely built, did not detect squirrels as they dangle on my pear tree only 10ft away. But, at the same time any leaf movement by a slight breeze was detected and trigered a ""false"" start on the unit, and this happened many many times in the course of an hour; imagine the water wasted. If you have any vegetacion 10, 15ft around the unit(trees, shrubs, vines, anything with leaves)do not bother buying this product. It doesn't know the difference between a leaf and a ""critter""."
3,Scarecrow for the garden,"I bought the Scarecrow for my husband to put in the garden to help keep the deer and rabbits from eating our goods. Worked great for about 3 weeks then it broke. Too expensive for it to not work longer than 3 weeks. While it did work it did a great job at keeping the animals away, but certainly not worth $60."
4,Great Product,"Depending on your need this can be a great product. I actually bought it long time ago to deter cats in my backyard. So that they do not try to steal my kois. But since it required a permanent garden hose connected to it all the time I did not use it. For last few weeks a heron has been stalking my fishes. He has not been successful yet but in desperation I brought out the scarecrow. I connected a pond pump to it instead of garden pipe and it seems to be working ok despite the low water pressure. I wish it would work as well with low water pressure as it does with high. Other than that, this thing works perfectly. Day or night. One other thing I wish it had was some kind of indicator that would show that it was activated. Maybe in next model..."
4,"Works, but it would be nice if you could aim it more precisely","I got this to keep animals out of my flower bed. It works as advertised, and you can adjust the sensitivity of the motion sensor. However, I wish there was more control over the direction and height of the spray. In order to cover the entire flower bed, I had to set it in a location where my neighbor can set it off by walking in his driveway. While the spray doesn't hit him, it sometimes comes in my office window. That aside, this is a much better solution for keeping animals out of your garden than chemical animal repellents (which half the time didn't work anyway)."
5,scarecrow review,"The Contech motion activated sprinkler is the greatest. The deer have not touched my squarefoot garden since we started using it. You can see tracks near the garden and see how the tracks widen as the deer is startled and runs away. The shipping was very fast, thank goodness."
4,Stop Deer and Other Yard Invaders,"Have used this product for years and never had an issue. Saved alot of plants and shrubs from deer and rabbits (except when the battery runs out). Easy to assemble, use and adjust. Waters the lawn or plants while it scares away invaders."
2,won't last long,"The good thing: It works perfectly fine for a certain time. This might be 2 month or less.The bad things:Eats batteries like anything especially if you use a high enough sensitivity to really scare away animals. It triggers so often that a change in shade or moving air can set it off. I used a fixed 9V supply to get away from changing batteries every week.Sensor looses sensitivity over time. Level 5 was enough at the beginning to set it off by a larger dog from 15 feet. At the end of it life span I had it on max and I could jump furiously in front of the sensor to get it started. Every smaller animal can easily walk straight in front of the device without getting wet. Even the deer came back once they noticed it's not working anymore.Conclusion: If your plants are more than $50 every 2 month go and get a good supply of the Scarecrows. If not build your own system using Adruino and some simple parts. Costs less, is fun and works longer."
5,It Works!,"I have an in-ground swimming pool that is ""closed"" and covered each fall through the winter. The cover is costly at about $2,400. Unfortunately, our three beagles like to run and play on it. Their claws damage it badly and I had to find a way to keep them off the cover. I found the Scarecrow Sprinkler on the Internet and decided to try it as a dog deterrent. I located the Scarecrow next to the pool, fiddled with the adjustments until it was aimed correctly and waited to see what would happen when the dogs decided to play on the cover. Predictably, they soon ran on the cover and were instantly greeted with a high pressure spray of water which they thoroughly hate. It only took a few such encounters for them to learn that they would get a spray bath if they got on the pool cover. The Scarecrow's range is excellent and it's sensitivity is adjustable. It works absolutely great for my purposes."
1,"it's so delicate, it's useless","The scarecrow sprinkler's watering mechanism is made of thin, delicate plastic. I broke it during testing, so now it is useless to me.I do not recommend this product.Why don't manufacturers use metal parts?"
3,Cannot Do The Job It Was Purchased For!,"I just want to post some observations/facts about this product.1) Despite the $60 price the scarecrow does not come with the needed 9-volt battery.2) It was purchased in the hope of keeping squirrels from raiding our tomato plants. It failed and in calling Contech they confirm that it will not work against squirrels.3) Assembly of item, including decals, took 5 minutes or less.4) It works great on humans."
1,Poor performance - short life,This device only turns on roughly half the time a dog enters its scan area. After a few months the unit quit altogether. In its defense it did soak a few teenagers in the back yard at 2am on a cold night. I enjoyed that.
2,Does not work with Raccoons,"I tried this product for several weeks to keep Raccoons from digging up our yard to look for grubs and no luck.They trip the spray mechanism, but do not really care if they get squirted or not.We have seen a reduction in pot holes in our yard as a result of this device, but not an eradication of potholes.May work for other types of animals, but cannot recommend it for Raccoons."
5,It Works For Skunks Too!,"I purchased the Scarecrow because of a skunk problem, and I had tried a number of other deterrents, with no success. However, its necessary to move it to a new location every few days. If not. they seem to learn how to work around to the back of it.Bob H.Louisville, Kentucky"
5,Keeping cats from pooping on your lawn,"I purchased this product to keep cats from pooping on my lawn. Since my yard is fenced in, it was disturbing to find poop on my lawn when I don't own animals. I didn't want to use chemicals. This product worked quickly and is easy to set up. Now my other neighbors are complaining of cat poop on their lawns!! Great product."
5,This is my third Scarecrow,"The only way I can have a strawberry patch out here in the country is with a Scarecrow. The deer seem to love the delectable leaves. It lasts all summer with just one 9-volt battery and they don't come near the patch as soon as it's set up. Found out today the one I've used for the last 3 years wasn't working, so ordered another one. I need one for the vegetable garden and one for the strawberries!It does make for some interesting entertainment for the neighbors if I forget to turn it off before going into the garden to do some weeding!"
5,Works well,"Works well never fails,keeps wild ducks geese out of my fish pond.Will probably buy a second one for the next pond now building."
5,No more deer!,"I got this to keep the deer out of the vegetable garden. Like elephant repellent, I can't tell if I haven't had more deer problems because of this or the deer repellent spray I applied or if the deer found better eats at a neighbor's house. But it does sense and spray moving targets. The first victim was my oldest girl and her unaware grandmother. I have heard it go off once at night.As far as I can determine, it was worth it."
4,Scarecrow,"The scarecrow works great. However I am finding that the threaded connection just below the head with its lower shaft comes apart easily with the slightest rough handling. It is always subject to rough handling since it is to be driven into the ground. Apparently the male and female threaded joints don't match up snugly enough. In terms of doing its job, I have been sprayed a half dozen times unexpectedly so it works."
4,ScareCrow Works,Keeps pets away from our new screened porch. Does what it says it would. (Does need hose - city pressure) I would recommend it to friends.
2,not for raccoons,The actual unit worked perfectly but because it had no effects on raccoons I had to give it 2 stars. For other creatures it might work but the raccoons were not deterred.
1,Does not work with Rabbits,"The unit works great when large subjects move by, even cars at 100 feet.But when a Jack Rabbit RUNS in front...NOTHING!It has some value however in that it's mere presents, and the fact that it goes off with any movement of a large subject probably is seen and heard by rabbits.I watched as a cotton tail hopped up to the scare crow and just stared at it for a couple of minutes."
3,Good technology but doesnt bother the skunk,"Pros:Good construction, pretty solid.Multiple settings for where to spray the waterMotion detection works as promisedKids like to play with itCons:Skunk doesnt care if it gets sprayed. They will go in direct line of fire to dig those taste grubs.Since it was installed we have a water pipe squeak when we turn the water on/off inside the house. Something to do with the sprinkler being at a low point and letting in air. Not"
2,"Good Idea, Not So Perfect","Pigeons and other large birds love to drink from our spa. Unfortunately they leave behind a huge mess. We thought the ""Scarecrow"" would be the perfect solution--not so! The birds fly to our spa without any problems. However, when we walk by at 20 to 30 feet away, the sensor is triggered and we get wet. I would like to know how the manufacturer got the ""Scarecrow"" to sense the birds! It has no problem sensing children and adults."
5,Contech CRO101 Scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler Contech CRO101 Scarecrow,The best product I ever purchased to get rid of raccoons digging up my garden every night. I am very happy.
2,Put up a fence.,"I used this item to deter groundhogs and deer from eating my garden. It definitely worked at deterring animals; for a period of time. It didn't make it through an entire season. Once, mid day, the pressure build up ruptured a new hose and flooded my back patio. A month later the head blew off, and the yard flooded. Also, if you like to sleep with the windows open, it does make quite a bit of noise when triggered."
2,Raccoons are a problem,"The Scarecrow device seemed to work at first when trying to scare away a group of four raccoons who are systemically tearing up my sod lawn looking for grubs. But raccoons are smart and they seem to have become acclimated to the device. I move the device around but it only sporadically works. I have tried other devices and they are even worse. I will have to have one of my lawns completely replaced and possibly use some form of netting instead. I wish the scarecrow had more ways to control the spray so it didn't shoot so high. Possibly I should buy more scarecrows but am leery of how long that will work, given how smart raccoons are. If I had known how much damage raccoons can do to a lawn I would not have gone that route but used other types of landscaping. One other problem is that the force of the spray gradually knocks the device out of the ground if it goes off too often."
4,Scarecrow works!,"I ordered the Scarecrow because birds were devouring our tomatoes this year. They pecked them so badly I thought a larger animal was responsible - like a squirrel - but after putting the Scarecrow up it seems to have driven them off and we're able to enjoy the rest of our tomatoes. I only wish I'd discovered it earlier. My husband put a spring loaded device on it which makes attaching the hose easier. I recommend it, although it will get you, too, if you happen to get in its ""eyesight."""
4,Scarecrow reakky works,I bought the scarecrow with the sole intent of keeping my neighbors cat out of my vegetable garden. Once installed the cat learned to not go near the garden and now it doesn't even enter my yard. The device worked as advertised. I think the device could be designed a little more rugged for the price but this seems to be the nature of the modern manufacturing thinking.
2,Very stupid machine,"This product does what it claims to, to a first approximation, but the motion sensor is very stupid. Towards the aggressive end of its sensitivity adjustment it goes off repeatedly into wind or when the pattern of shadows changes fast (perhaps the sun comes out from behind a cloud), but on the same setting it will let deer mosey to within one meter, straight ahead, before it will turn on. If the area you have to protect is tiny (a few square meters) then it's great. Deer jump a mile high when they're standing so close. But for larger areas it is nigh-useless."
1,scarecrow motion activated sensor,"We received our scarecrow and when it didn't work, we sent an email to the company. This was answered by a canned statement that the product must be dirty and we should clean it. When we called the company they took us through a series of ""tests"" to check for dirt,again. Even though I told them that it had not been used so how could it be dirty. They finallly agreed to send a new product, which we have not received as yet. I would not buy from this company again."
1,LOUSY!,This product did not even last functioning properly for 2 weeks. The sensitivity of the product varied from day to day. Then it just stopped working altogether. DO NOT BUY this product
5,scarecroe motion-activated sprinkler,This product work great!!!! It has help me keep the deer and ground hogs out of my flowers. My husband was so pleased he told me to buy two more and my friends ask where did you find that?THANKS FOR A GREAT ITEM!!!!!!!!!!
3,Scarecrow motion activated sprinkler,"This thing works great! The only thing is the part where it couples to the hose isn't the tightest, so water will spray out there as well as where it's directed. Otherwise, highly effective!"
5,Lots of fun in the garden!,"Item works amazingly well. Excellent for keeping birds out of the garden; squirrels not so much, they are quite tenacious! The motion activated feature works very well, the only issue I have is leaking a bit at the connections. My husband had to put some tape around the shaft where the head screws on, no problems after that. As an added bonus, great for pranking family and friends! My dog thinks it's his new toy."
4,Does what I want,"It is larger than I expected. It does what I wanted, sprays the cats who are trying to muscle in on my yard."
2,"Works, but not for small animals","I bought this item to keep the neighborhood cats out of my back yard, but unfortunately it was hit or miss if the sprinkler ever went off. When I was testing it, it really only seemed to shoot out water 1 out of 5 times of motion activity, and it didn't seem to work with smaller animals. Great concept, just wish it was a little more accurate."
3,Works as claimed.,"The effectiveness of this product depends upon the intelligence, cunning, determination of the ""pests"" that you want to keep away from your garden. In my case, the squirrels were way more hungry and crafty for this item. After they figured it out, these rodents either found an alternate route to my tomatoes or didn't mind a little shower before their meal. Again, the product works as advertised, but was more effective at keeping people away from the area than the intended ""poachers."" It even got me a couple of times....!"
3,scarecrow,"Bought it to chase away cats in the yard. It works very well but it leaks, it is cheaply made out of plastic."
4,"It leaks a little, but it keeps my dogs out of my succulent garden","Neat product. I purchased it to keep my younger dog out of my succulent garden. She'd been digging it up every other day, so I tried surrounding the garden in light wire garden fencing, she blew through that like a tornadeo. Next I reinforced the fencing with bamboo stakes & horizontal lengths, which she chewed through. I was going to install 2x4s & chicken wire, but it would have been pretty unsightly, so I finally tried the Scarecrow. Works great. Only thing is it works on me too, I absent mindedly stepped into the Scarecrow's range to retrieve some broken bamboo and had to change my suit before going to work."
3,scarecrow review,"My husband and I were very excited when we got the scarecrow, we were hoping it would really scare the raccoon that is trying to get to our koi fish in the pond, but it did not matter to him or even scare him! It does though work to scare off cats!"
5,This thing works great!,This is a great idea and it works really well. It's easier than putting up an entire fence around the area you want to protect and doesn't harm any animals. But it certainly gives them a start if they venture near it. The sensativity adjustment setting and distance of water spray adjustments make it perfect for most areas. I wish I had invented it.
3,Works as expected but eats batteries.,"This items works as expected, it keeps the chickens out of a portion of the garden. It also emits an abrupt noise when the sprinkler comes on which, by itself, is a deterrent. However the device is a big consumer of 9 volt batteries needing replacement every 7 to 10 days (there is no indication when the battery dies). Also, if you need to attach multiple units, it can be cumbersome with hoses all over the yard. Overall, most effective in a single application covering a moderately sized area but can be expensive buying batteries."
3,So far it's working,Saw this item and decided it would be worth trying to solve my problem of dogs crapping on my front lawn. I strategically placed it out front and so far it seems to be working. One issue I have with it is the spray goes off periodically to reduce the water pressure. Wish it had a valve below to do that instead. But in general this is a well-made product that features adjustable spray settings and angle. The sensor is basically a turn knob and goes from 'off' to full sensor. Maybe one change could be a setting from 1-5 or something along those lines so it's more predictable and consistent to change.
5,The Scarecrow just plain works,"I've used these for several years to keep deer away from our roses and (inadvertently) solicitors from cutting across the lawn. As long as you set them up properly and use enough for the area you need covered they just plain work. You can daisy chain them together, you can replace the common sprinkler parts from a hardware store. It's an elegant combination of simple devices that together function perfectly.Could it be improved? Hmmm. You could certainly add features: These are usually triggered at night. You could put an LED strobe on it to illuminate the cone of spray when triggered. It would add another startling sensory input to the poor animal that wandered into its path. But that would be overkill on an already effective solution. Just buy it."
5,Great,"Exactly what is said, there is no reason for me to write more of a review for this product. ok"
3,sprinkler,Bit fiddley and plastic. Purchased it to scare off unwanted cats but yet to use it. Bit scared it may break
2,not so much,"I purchased this for my front yard to keep cats from using my yard as their personal toilet. Although I have set the setting as low as possible, it continues to trigger the sensor even when a car drives past...still trying to work on the right location."
1,The Pope still eats my rhododendrons.,"After seeing one of the customer pictures, I assumed this product would be very good for solving my unique problem. Every Sunday after mass, the Pope sneaks into my backyard and goes to town on all my plants. Normally I have to spend the whole night awake with a shotgun and a floodlight to keep him away, which naturally makes work difficult on Mondays. Having seen that this product is an effective scarePope based on customer pictures, I immediately made the purchase,hoping that my worries would be over. When I woke up Monday morning, lo and behold all my rhododendrons were missing. Also, garden slugs ate my tomatoes. This is entirely unrelated, but I'm mad about it anyway."
2,Disposable scarecrow,The Contech Scarecrow is made of plastic almost entirely.It worked great for 8 to 10 weeks but the summer sun destroyed it.I ordered another one because it does keep animals off the lawn.Now that summer is over the new one might last a while longer.
3,Does not work on squirrels,"This is a good product if you have problems with larger animals, but it simply didn't work on keeping squirrels out of my vegetable garden. The picked every tomato I had in a little under a week. I played around with it for several days as well, different settings, angles, etc. If you have small critter problems I would recommend an electric fence. That is what I will try next year."
3,Its a garden saver.,"I needed it for just a small space (about 10-15ft) so trying to get it set up was not as easy as I had hoped. It did leak a bit from the hose area but that could be due to my water pressure. My house very close to main water source and always have better then great water pressure. I took care of the leak problem by anchoring the scarecrow in a clay flower pot in stead of ground. Now I can move it about easily if need be and the plants get a semi constant water source. Main reason for getting it was cats in my garden. Now no more cats in my garden, I don't even have to turn it on every day now just took about a week for the cats to realize garden is not a safe place. wish I had it set up at the start of planting. some plants would have been saved."
3,animals beware,"My dogs do not like it. My wife likes her garden dog free, I do not like the hesitation before it comes on. It could be a little quicker. The sprinkler's spray cannot be adjusted. It has a single stream of water and it shoots high."
5,"Shoos the deer! (and people, too)",Scarecrow works as promised. Nice to have a no-chemical response to foraging deer. (Don't forget to turn it off before doing yard work....)
5,Super idea that works!,This works like a charm!!! No smelly chemicals to keep the deer away from Roses and Hydrangeas any longer.
5,Scarecrow motion activated,I've had this product for the last five years however my grandchildren got a hold of it and broke it so i bought two this time. It really keeps the deer out of my garden and is well worth the price. Highly recommended if you have an animal problem in your garden.
5,Eliminates Hooved Vermin,"After deer destroyed my wife's garden over the space of three short nights, we invest in a scarecrow. It was easy to assemble and install and worked perfectly. As long as it is on, it keeps the filthy beasts out of our garden. One caveat: our deer seem to test it regularly and have returned to the garden when I've forgotten to leave the hose on. If you have a hose in your garden and a deer problem, I would not hesitate to buy this product. It works!"
5,THANK YOU!!,"There is a cat in the neighborhood that kept ripping up my garden and using it as its litter box. I tried several things and couldn't get it to stop. Not only was it unhealthy and gross, but he was killing plants! He kept digging them up (I lost two watermelon plants to uprooting). I got two of these and he hasn't been back since. I've only had it up for about 2 weeks, but he was coming back nightly, no matter what I did. Thank you, thank you, thank you!!"
2,Not for rabbits.,"Product just won't spray rabbits. Spent the last week moving the Scarecrow to different areas of the lawn, changing the angle is was inserted in, playing around with different sensitivity levels and all for naught. It just won't pick up the presence of anything as small as a rabbit. Every morning I went out and there were fresh piles of rabbit droppings all within the range of the Scarecrow. Disappointing, since I really wanted this to work!For critters larger than a rabbit, it probably would work fine so I am giving it two stars instead of one.We did manage to spray a few guests as they came up the sidewalk to our front door though."
4,Deer repellent scare crow,This is the only thing that really keeps the deer away. Other chemical repellents just don't seem to work all the time.Only negative is having to keep the water pressure on hoses.
2,Deceptive advertising,"The information on the product indicated that it would work with cats. There was even a photo of a cat. The directions stated that it has difficulty with small animals. During testing, a cat walked close by with no results. Also, the website photo showed a foot petal to help drive it into the ground. The product has no foot petal, making it very difficult to drive it into the ground. The sprayer needs to be driven deep to stay up during the spraying, due to its force. I decided to get a refund."
5,We have our backyard back!,We had a big problem with all the neighborhood cats using our backyard as a litterbox. We could not a find a way to stop them until now. We bought the Scarecrow about 5 weeks ago and had not one surprise from the cats scince. We can enjoy our backyard again.
4,Motion Activated Sprinkler,Everything about this motion activated sprinker is exactly like the advertisement. It works great too. My fish in my backyard pond are now happy without any predators around to bother them. The only issue I have is with applying the yellow stickers. If you don't get them just right it can be a hassle. I would think that the mfg would apply these in the process of making this device. I suppose though that this might increase the cost though. The device was delivered and arrived as promised. I would order another one if needed.
2,Cheap plastic,Made of cheap plastic. I can see this thing breaking very easily. It works on large animals and me for the most part. Kind of a pain in having to dodge this thing to get to the controls every time I want to go into the yard. Have to remember to turn it on every night or risk blowing up the garden hose if left on in the hot sun every day.Watched rabbit walk right by the thing without it going off. Also went off a lot with nothing around.Decided to try liquid fence instead. My Mom swears by the stuff.
2,Cheap plastic,"It works, but the hose housing is really cheap plastic that leaks and is easy to break."
3,not good for cats,"This is more for people with a fenced in yard. It works very well, but I returned mine because all the animal has to do is go BEHIND the sprinkler to get where he is going without getting wet. If you have a fenced in yard, you can put the sprinkler against the fence so nothing can go behind it. It still would have worked for me, but I actually would have needed 2 since my yard is so big. I also didn't like the idea of having a hose pipe running through my yard 24/7. The cats at my house just walk by like nothing is there. I think one cat actually likes to get sprayed."
4,Deer repeller,"Deer are very plentiful here and eat everything in the yard. All lilies, hostas, and any other plant except irises. I use two of these in the yard to startle the deer and help some of my plants survive. Have another to put out in another area.Only problem is you have to remember to turn the water off if you are going to walk or work in the area covered by the motion sensor!"
5,Does what it's suppose to,"Little tough to calibrate. I think it got me wet more than the critters :) but that's because there's a sidewalk in close proximity to the ""red zone"".It works well."
4,Good idea,"This is a good way to chase off the wandering cats from the neighborhood. My only complaint is that there is not enough vertical control of the height of the spray. I have mine near the bird feeders and it was hard to adjust it so that it sprayed the cat, but didn't hit the feeders above. I had to tilt the whole unit down, which then affected the distance that the IR beam reached. So I won't give it 5 stars, but I will give it 4."
1,Contech Electronics Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler #CRO101,"I am having a Heron issue with eating my KOI. I purchased the following:(1) Two Contech Electronics Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler #CRO101(2) One Owl with a rotating head(3) One Great Blue Heron DecoySave your money and just build yourself a net to put over your KOI pond.I know this review is asking about the Contech Electronics Scarecrow Motion-Activated Sprinkler #CRO101 so here it is.I purchased two scarecrow's and it cost me $160.00 which included shipping and don't forget handling charges. They work really well, every time I cut the grass, or go to the mailbox I get sprayed.... but as far as the heron, it does not scare the Heron at all. I have seen the Heron fly on the fence, wait for the sprinkler to go off, then fly down get a Koi and fly off. While the Heron flew off, then the sprinkler came on again.I hope you listen to this review and don't waste your money!!!They do make cute yard ornaments!!"
2,Not robust enough,"The scarecrow works. That is it works under ideal circumstances. We have a lot of landscaping and wind trips it too easy. It trips so much (when no animal is nearby) that the batteries run down and it is useless when it is needed. If you have an open area that you're wanting to protect it probably will work fine. However, if you have a lot of landscaping that you are wanting to keep dogs, cats and chickens out of, you may find it to be a disappointment."
2,Works only occasionally,"I purchased this to keep an invasion of stray cats into my yard at bay. It worked well the first month. However, even with new batteries this item is losing its sensitivity, even set at maximum. The strays are returning."
3,Yes and No,"I have tried everything to deter raccoons from my pond after dozens of fish have been eaten over the years, along with it being trashed every night. this worked for awhile until they got wise and learned how to duck under the water. We watched and could not believe it. We even stopped stocking fish and they have returned for years afterwards. They won!"
4,Dog Control,"I bought the Scarecrow with the intention of using it to keep my dog out of a particular area of the yard. It works. Plus, it waters the lawn. A great (and lest costly) alternative to an invisible fence, where applicable."
4,SCARECROW,This product works great. The only trouble I've had is that I cannot get it to spray less than about 35 feet. This makes it spray high on the wall and some sprinkles go over the fence into the neighbors yards. I really like how it works otherwise and it really keeps critters off the yard.
4,Not very effective against the daughter's boyfriend...,"Like others, we've had a problem with obnoxious pests visiting our yard late at night. The Contech Scarecrow worked really well the first time, but the vermin rapidly adapted and learned to avoid the covered region (front yard plus bedroom window). Even moving the Scarecrow around only worked the first couple of times. I've decided to use rose bushes and transplanted poison ivy as a more permanent deterrent."
1,Scarecrow never worked,"Despite calling Contech for help and many hours adjusting and testing the scarecrows, I could never get either of the 2 to work properly. They would activate only on rare occasions. I am waiting for a refund from Amazon."
3,Advertised for smaller animals but not that good,"While I was estatic at the possibility of finally finding a product that would rid my grass of the rabbit issue, this product doesn't quite meet it's advertised promises. The instructions that come with it advise that ""smaller animals may not be detected"", yet the advertisement specifically shows rabbits.I'm still using it as I need something to attempt to scare them off the lawn, but the scanner on this isn't up to snuff for rabbit concerns."
1,Did not work for us.,This product did not work for us. It would come on when nothing was near.. (okay to water flowerbeds but rather expensive for that).. but did not deter the pesty neighbour dogs from leaving nasty piles next to the sprinkler. Would NOT purchase another.
3,Arrived but a Problem,"We ordered 2 Scarecrows. However, only one arrived in working condition. A call to customer service and a very pleasant young lady guided me thru the disassembly of the product to get down to the inner workings only to find that, yes, indeed the product was defective. I was advised that a replacement would be sent---no need to return the non-functioning one (which was now in a myriad of pieces and had it been considered ""operational"", I would never have been able to get it back together). That was yesterday and we are happy to know that another Scarecrow is flying this way via UPS."
3,Scarecrow,"This works great the only problems that bug me is the stake which comes with it is not worth a hoot. Better buy a piece of iron rod to hammer in the ground and then use a hose clamp to clamp the base to the iron rod. One other thing that I did not consider is...When the sprinkler system comes on, the motion dector goes to work too. The only way to turn it off is to remember to go out and do it before the sprinklers come on. Otherwise you will use a lot of batteries. Should have a timer on it."
4,Scarecrow scares raccoons some of the time,"I bought this product to scare raccoons away from newly planted ground cover, which they dug up every night in their search for grubs. Frustrating! I had tried to foil them with just about everything, including sitting up at night with a shotgun, but the devils knew when I was there and waited until I was too tired or cold to stay. Then they came out to do their dirty work.The Scarecrow worked well the first several times, until the masked bandits somehow figured out how get under the radar of the motion sensor. It then helped to move the device so that it targeted them from a different direction.This product works well--I can vouch for that since it has gotten me, my husband, and the gas meter man soaked more than once. But raccoons are wily critters. Make sure you change the Scarecrow's location every few days to make them think they're being ambushed from all sides, and it should drive them off the area you're protecting."
4,Pretty good,"This is a pretty clever product. I have mine near the bird feeders and it was hard to adjust it so that it sprayed the cat, but didn't hit the feeders above. I had to tilt the whole unit down, which then affected the distance that the IR beam reached. So I won't give it 5 stars, but I will give it 4 out of 5. This is a good way to chase off the wandering cats from the neighborhood. My only complaint is that there is not enough vertical control of the height of the spray but still pretty good."
5,Saved a relationship with a neighbor over our cat(s),"We have a few cats that are ours but were found as ferals - thus, they are out and about all the time and come close to our yard only for feeding times. A new neighbor whose younger daughters play in the front yard on the grass found that they were using a section as a ""potty area"". Cat repellents (spray or other)worked for only a week at $10.00+ a week....in looking at the reviews on this I thought this was worth a try. After purchasing the Scarecrow and a hose for the neighbor - 2 weeks later he has said that they have found no cat ""poop"" issues on the front lawn! Hooray for the scarecrow...it works!"
5,The darn thing works.,"I purchased this thing because I grow and sell Koi in a large outdoor pond. We had a great big blue heron come a callin in addition to the kingfishers and osprey in our area and I just wasn't feeling very secure. I didn't want to use netting to protect the fish as the natural surroundings would be compromised. I hooked up this thing in less than 20 minutes and had it working. It works like a charm and no more big bad birds! PS put the stickers on before you bring it outdoors, its alot earlier. I will be buying another when my additional pens are complete. [...]"
3,works but leaks,"I purchased this item to try and discourage several feral/community cats from using my yard as their own personal spraying ground. It has worrked reasonably well and there are significantly fewer cats using my yard. The only problem is it leaks like crazy. I have wrapped it in several layers of tape and that only helped a little bit. I then purchased a timer and a multi hose connector. both of these items helped, the multihose connector cuts down the volume of water going through to the scarecrow and the timer means I am only wasting water from the leaks for 2 hours at a time. I set it in the evening and in the morning.I have a very large yard and 1 particular cat has discovered the 'blind spots' I would definitely concider buying a second or third to cover my whole yard, but not quite yet."
5,Cat be gone,"We have a convertible parked under a car port, cats were constantly getting on the top and sleeping, it was a giant fur mess. This sprinkler was the last ditch effort to stop them. After about a week of setting it during the night, NO MORE FUR or tracks. Very humane and very effective. Wonderful device."
5,Better Anti-animal Sprayer,"I received this in enough time to try this before the holidays.The sprayer cuts a small arc, but reaches the area I need to keep the neighbor's cat out of. I noticed a few days where the ground was wet, but no cat droppings. The neighbor's cat has this ""mean"" look on its face when it looks at me, but its better than dispatching the cat to another realm when it does its business.No leaks, the spray lasts for the 5 seconds its supposed to, and its effective. I'm not out cleaning up my gravel drive as I used to on a weekly basis.I was ready to design and build my own, but this meets my needs."
5,It works GREAT!!,"I love my Gardens and put alot of time into them BUT our old black lab thought those damp areas were her personal pig pen,, the Scarecrow keeps her out and me happy THANK YOU, It's easy to use, works just like it's decribed. Wish we would have gotten it years ago!If it could be redesigned, a adjustable pole would be handy for the set up and a 90 degree hose hook-up would make it less top heavy."
5,dutchtex1009,Best cat chaser i ever saw...... they were ruining our flower beds... this sure stopped that .........
1,An expensive failure,"I've been trying to keep cats out of my yard. This didn't do it. It sprays my bushes when a breeze moves them, but it doesn't detect the cats at all. I would suggest you not waste your money."
2,How can one stop the leaking from the connector?,"Great idea, but I have done everything from purchasing a new hose, to putting in rubber rings to even putting plumbers tape around the item to stop the water from spurting out. I have not been able to use the product because you have to leave the hose on and over the course of time gallons of water will leak out. Who has a fix for this? UGH!!!"
5,Worth the investment!,"Our problem is the neighborhood cats who are allowed to roam. They were ruining our garden, lawn, etc. We tried so many different things to keep them away, without any lasting success. The Scarecrow is fantastic! The cats (as well as other bothersome 'strays') stay away and they are not harmed in any way (except perhaps their pride)!The Scarecrow is very well made--quite sturdy. Also, I had the Scarecrow on daily and the battery lasted for nearly two months.I highly recommend this product--it is effective on more than just deer or rabbits!Our flower beds and lawn are recovered."
4,So satisfied I bought a second one,"I knew I had to find a solution after deer repeatedly ate my young broccoli and tomato plants. So-called deer repellent spray didn't work. The Contech motion-activated sprinkler seemed like a good option, and Amazon had a good price for it (way cheaper than Home Depot's).It just works. And - bonus - it waters your plants. The trick is to set it up right. The sensitivity should be adjusted as the seasons progress. The plants grow, and the device could be activated more often as the wind plays with the plants growing in its radius of detection. The battery should be changed when the device shows signs of fatigue - every 3 to 6 months. The first one I bought went through a freezing winter and a scorching summer and still works perfectly. In fact, I'm so happy with it that I bought another one for the heirloom garden I'm setting up on the other side of the house."
5,"So effective, we bought 2 more!","We now have 3 of these sprinklers and I'm 100% convinced they work. I now have them on a timer so they only come on at night, and I can tell you, anytime we forget to turn the one that isn't timed on, we can expect the deer to get in and have some snacks.It is a great product. The only feature I'd like to see is a built in timer system."
5,Best purchase in a long time!,"This works great! I plan to buy another to get full coverage of my garden. It comes with the ""scarecrow"" decals not applied so if you do not want them, it is a plain black box. We opted to attach the decals and think it looks great! It senses every animal that has tried to enter the garden including those pesky wild turkeys. I highly recommend this."
3,Good for Geese,"We have a wetlands right off of our back yard. The geese have been chewing the grass down very low and leaving a lot of poop on the lawn. It was a mess. I bought this sprinkler and set it up and it started working immediately. There has been a dramatic change in the grass of my back yard. It is growing and there is much less bird waste. It does occasionally go off when there are no geese but it could be from a small bird flying by or something else. It only uses 1.5 cups of water to shoot for 3 seconds so it is not a big deal. Some of the single adult Geese dont seem to be too afraid of the sprinkler so it doesn't always work.By the way, my kids love playing with it."
2,fair to poor outcome,"I have a pond and have had problems during the spring with cranes and raccoons. Cats, well, they may frighten off at first, but I have witnessed birds, cats, coons, all just standing in the full force spray of the water taking a ""shower"". I still keep it connected, as it helps keep the plants watered all day long, but as a deterant to critters, poor."
2,Did not work for Ducks,This product although appeared nice did not work to scare away ducks in and around my pool. The sprinkler didn't work consistently and the ducks didn't mind the shower it gave them. Nice looking unit but didn't work for my application.
2,The scarecrow isn't all that scary,"I installed the product and did not have trouble getting it to work initially.After a while, it seemed like it lost sensitivity and needed to be reset. It had stopped responding to motion. I reset it and reconfigured it, and it worked again.It seems like I have to go fiddle with it periodically for it to work correctly, which isn't great. But, it's a pretty inexpensive device so I guess I got what I paid for.Pros: Cheap. Works well when it works.Cons: Needs to be fiddled with periodically to keep it working."
1,IT DON'T DO DUCKS,"It works great when I walk by it. No matter where I placed it or what settings, the ducks in our swimming pool play and frolic right in front of it and absolutely NEVER does it activate."
4,Appear to be very similar to Havahart,"I have three units, two Scarecrow and one Havahart. I can see no difference in results. Both have done an excellent job keeping deer away. The raccoons ignore the spray and suffer the consequences. My guess is that the units are made by the same company. The parts seem to be interchangeable and work the same way. I recommend both products as a very effective way to keep deer away as they don't like either the water or the noise generated. After four years, we finally we have roses."
5,great pet deterrent,The scarecrow sprinkler works great to keep the animals out of your garden. My neighbor's cat used ours for his personal kitty box and now he can't step in without getting a bath.
4,"It works, but its pricey","The sprinkler solved a problem I was having with the neighbor's cat pooping in my yard. I was disappointed to not be awoken by a cat screaming as it was doused with water, but the cat seems to have got the picture anyway. There are a few downsides to the unit. As other reviewers have stated the sprinkler head is sub-par, especially considering the cost of the overall unit. However, this is easy to replace. I wish there was a remote control so it could be turned off from a safe distance. I've been hit a couple times making the mad dash to turn it off from behind. It would also be nice if it took AA batteries vs. the 9V not included battery. I did not have a problem with leaks as other have stated. Overall, I am very happy with the purchase, and my kids are happy to be able to play in the back yard without the fear of falling into a pile of cat poop."
3,Rabbit Defense,"The motion-activated sprinkler is great. However, it would be nice if the support stem was shorter and with a 90o hose adapter. This will allow the unit to be installed closer to the ground. Rating would have been higher if the sprinkler head had the capability of being adjustable up or down and not just left or right."
3,May not work with cats.,"This has been set up for a week now. The manual does state that it may not work with cats. The cat tearing up my yard has so far not set this off. In fact the cat does turn on my porch lights since I have a motion sensor for them, then she sits down next to the Contech and stares at the house.I on the other hand set the damn thing off all the time. Soon we will have water rationing due to drought. Then I will take to chasing the cat down and beating it over the head with the thing. (Just kidding... sort of...)I can't wait to find out what the local skunks think about it...-After more than a month, it would appear the look of the thing inhibits the cats more than the water. I am still not sure they even set it off...-"
5,Good Bye Cats!,"My garden was continually used as a liter box for the neighbor's cats and got the Scarecrow, installed it in minutes and now I harvest nothing but vegetables from my garden. Great product!"
5,"Easy setup, effective. Here's how it works.","I was surprised by how easily this was to put together and set up. You put the scarecrow stickers on yourself, so those are optional if you prefer a more subtle look. I've only had it out for a couple days, but I've seen deer react to it and they leave in a hurry. I might get another one.One thing I wanted to mention that I didn't quite grasp when I ordered it is that it's just a motion sensor that opens a valve to a sprinkler. It's not doing any aiming; it just turns the sprinkler on for a few seconds. You can adjust the sprinkler coverage with a couple stops and the distance with a wheel on the top of the sprinkler head, but it's not like it hits animals with a targeted jet of water.Still, a great product that humanely deters animals."
4,Squirrel Chaser,"I lilke it. It was easy to install (unlike other negative reviews on putting it together)..and it works. Most times it keeps squirrels out but because the water flow arcs, it doesn't always scare the little varmints on the ground under the arc. It is the best deterrent so far.LdpStamford CT"
4,keeping the pests away,"so far it has worked a treat on bush turkeys. they still learn the boundaries and get in but it is much better than repairing damage every day. The only issue is the battery does not last very long, I have been unsing it for 1 month and have had to replace battery all ready"
5,scarecrow,Pretty easy to set up and it works! The width of the spray and how far it shoots is all adjustable so you can make it work for your needs -easily.
5,As good as previous reviews stated,"Since this purchase came late in the season for a colder climate, we have only been able to try it for a couple of weeks. But I am happy to report that for those 2 weeks the pesky neighborhood cats were pursued by this new scare tactic. It does indeed give them cause to do their daily deeds in another location. And if that location is another area of your yard, just move the crow and wait for the next success. Watch out for yourself as you will activate the motion with very little movement. So far very happy and have high hopes starting next spring."
1,Motion sprinkler,"the purchase of Contech cro101 scarecrow Motion Activated Sprinkler worked just 5 days. I changed the battery, resseted and still did not work. I do not recomend this product."
3,Scarecrow,"The scarecrow works well at scaring animals away from the garden. It leaked water, however, within the first few weeks. For the price, it should do better than that."
3,good,works well to spray at animals that are trying to get at our fish in the pond- unfortunately racoons and herons can learn to outsmart it and get to the fish without getting wet.
1,Contech Scarecrow CRO101,"Complete and totally useless. Has not scared a deer away yet. It's nothing else but a cheap lawn sprinkler with a mickey mouse motion detector. A waste of money, in short: a piece of sh..t !!!"
5,LOVE THIS,"This sprinkler is a riot! I have problems with neighborhood cats and was tired of waking up to them ""playing"" in my garden. Got this sprinler and I have fun watching it go off on unsuspecting objects. I only wish I would have bought it sooner in the season. Now its winter and I cant leave my hose on without it freezing. This will be the first thing I put up in the spring. Just be careful of stepping in the strike zone. Its a powerful and quick stream. You think you are safe, but you arents. Fantastic product!!!!"
2,Not for us!,"The product leaked ALL THE TIME.It did not reach far enough in both directions, which left lots ofroom for cats to roam!This product was not for us."
1,very disappointed,"The scarecrow does not even come close to the pictures shown. The sensor is weak, does not detect unless you get right up on it; the pressure is not near as strong as what is in the picture and the distance is also very weak. I came home from work and there was a pile of dog poop 4 feet from the scarecrow. I feel I was ripped off. Don't waste your money."
3,Goes off too often,This really is a great item but it would not work for my circumstance. The wind blowing my shrubs would set it off as well as the cars going down the street. I had it at the end of my flower bed and it was going off every 3 to 4 minutes for no reason. I am afraid my flowers will rot and then I'll have a new problem. I am returning it and am going to try the sonic motion detector and hopefully that will keep the cats away.
1,Deer like scarecrows,Three of these going off one day as we drove up on the driveway to see three dear munching under their spray
4,a little leaky but effective!,"The gizmo is easy to put together, and is very effective at deterring the huge deer population in our area, as well as rabbits and so far, squirrels. It's also fun to trigger the motion sensor and run like mad to get out of its way.However, it is a little leaky, from the top of the unit where the spray is emitted, after every trigger. We're not sure whether our yard is wet from leakage or from constant triggering by local wildlife."
5,Just what I needed!,These are replacements for the scarecrows we bought a number of years ago. They did the trick better than anything else we've tried to repel the deer from using our gardens as there own personal salad bowls.
4,Keeps deer away,"So far I like this sprinkler. But what is ironic is I received this item on a Thursday and we left Friday morning for a weekend trip and did not have time to set the scarecrow sprinkler up. When we returned home on Sunday I found we had visitors that had gotten over the fence into our garden. I was so upset and disappointed I did not get it set up before we left. But since we have set it up there has been no signs of anyone getting in the garden, even the grandchild! It surprised him when visiting us last weekend. Great product."
2,Racoons,I was trying to protect my grape vines from Raccoons. My grapes are on an arbor at roof height of my garage. The raccoons cross the roof to get to the vines. I put the scarecrow on the roof to scare the raccoons away. It worked for 3 day and then the raccoons figured it out. They decided that getting a little wet was not a problem. We do live in a very rainy area. There was nothing I could do once the figured it out. I tried additional units and moving them around. I finally gave up and let them eat my grapes.
2,Great Idea,Great idea but this is a very cheaply made product. I just returned my second one. I truly wanted this to be a good product to keep a neighbors dog from using my lawn as its toilet. With the way that this is made it should cost $9.95.
1,Bitter disappointment! Twice!,"Startled by all the positive reviews. Influenced by the encouraging reviews, purchased this product on two occasions (the second time after our memory had faded about the poor experience the first time around). Besides the cheaply-made sensor housing, the mechanism is erratic and doesn't closely reproduce its stated intent. In an effort to create the ideal `conditions' for the ScareCrow, we even purchased a pressure reducer as well as a new set of 9V batteries (as suggested in the manual ). To no avail. At best, this item may have amused our local wildlife; certainly didn't trouble them. The ScareCrow (at least to us) was a waste of money, highly unreliable, and not effective in its intended purpose."
2,Wouldn't suggest it,"Works good but leaks constantly. Followed the directions on how to stop the leak from the sprayer, didn't do any good, still leaked. The motion detector works great and the spray goes a long way, it's just the constant leak that is the problem. Can't use it because the leak causes a HUGE puddle and our water bill jumped up very noticeably. Nope, wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Blue Heron loves it,"I have a Blue Heron problem, in that it visits me every day. The unit works, but the heron is not bothered at all buy it. I tried placing it in different locations, with various settings and nothing worked. The bird seems to like getting a shower. The unit may work on other animals, but it does not scare herons."
1,Not for Groundhogs,Ground hogs ate my shrubs right in front of device despite sensitivity on max!!! Goes off for no reason other times.
4,Contect Scarecrow,Bought this to stop the neighbor's cats using my front yard as their litter box. The scarecrow has worked very well. The cats stop visiting my yard. Four stars because it leaks and waste the water.
4,Does the job,"I bought the scarecrow due to the fact that our cats along with the neighborhood cat were using our flowerbed as their own personally litter box. The would dig and push all our mulch out of the flowerbed, making for a poor looking display. I tried using chili pepper and landscaping covers, nothing worked. The scarecrow does the job for us, they don't use our flowerbed anymore. I would have given a five star rating, but this product is not really made for small flowerbeds, its better for gardens or large areas. I think the sound of the scarecrow going off scares the animals more than the water does. Either way it serves its purpose."
4,Works as advertised,"We live in an area with heavy deer pressure. Basically any plant in our yard is fair game unless it is fairly ""deer resistant"" After moving to the area in 2009, we tried a garden in 2010 with disastrous results. All our plants were completely consumed within a few weeks of planting. So in 2011, we tried the Scarecrow based upon reviews here and talking with friends. Our garden this year has been one of the best ever, with complete protection. The only issue we had was when the battery ran out and we missed 2 days (and lost 2 tomato plants and much of a blackberry!). This thing works really well, even when we are gone on vacation. We use it on the highest sensitivity (covers about a 30 foot semicircle) and change the battery every 30 days. It doesn't use that much water either, since the sprinler is only on for about 2 seconds. The only reason for 4 and not 5 stars is that I don't know the long term reliability of the product."
2,It worked great for ONE DAY,It worked great for one day. Now it is not working. The battery is new. The water is on. It just doesn't work.
2,Doesnt work,We bought two the first one didnt work from day one it wouldnt shut off the second one worked about a week than the same thing happened it just would come on and never shut off. The idea is great the product just didnt work for us.
5,Fun for raccoons AND meter readers!,"The raccoons hate it, and it's always fun to watch a new guy come to read my water meter if I don't get this thing turned off early enough in the morning. :)"
4,Too much plastic,"Works great, but doesn't detect movement in a very wide range. Too much plastic, makes it hard to place. Leaks at the hose connection."
4,Cats will stop crapping in your yard,"I set one of these up near a spot where one of the neighborhood cats had decided its litter box was. That was the last day I had to deal with cat poop. I will say that the thing goes off semi frequently and sometimes it does not go off when it should. I would not leave it on long term, but it can definitely change the behavior in animals smart enough to remember an experience."
2,Don't waste your time...,"I was anxious to get this one when it first came out.I spent almost 15 dollars at that time to order it by mail.But i was really disappointed.Sure it was Felix from the 50s.But the original title sequence had been replaced by some generic junky looking title, and then an sloppy cut to the original cartoon.So, I see you can pick it up for cheap now.And if you're not too picky, then go ahead.But you were warned!"
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"If you long for seeing anything about Felix the Cat, this CD is for you. Otherwise, if you're expecting a true ""Collector's Edition,"" don't waste your time and don't waste your money.Given that this was a DVD, I was expecting to see several classic episodes from Felix the Cat. Instead, this DVD only contained one hour (or ten episodes) from the series. DVDs can hold at least two hoursr of material.... this was a great disappointment!I was really disappointed because many of the things that made the series special were missing:* no va-va-voom!* only two five minute episodes with the magic bag* only one episode with Master Cylinder* only two five minute episodes with Rock Bottom* only one and a half episodes with PoindexterThis is not a ""Collector's Edition."" It's just a random set of episodes that someone put together to make a quick buck."
4,felix the cat review,"The cartoons are excellent. It brougfht back great memories. However, I am dissappointed that there are actually so few cartoons. They art truly enjoyable, and I reccommend them, but, I would like to see 50, or more episodes."
4,Felix the cat video,Video quality is fine...I was a little dissapointed as it is still the 'old' vintage Felix..I am still looking for Felix the Cat as seen on TV in the 60's...
2,"Extremely outdated, covers ""new"" gui ala Windows 3.0","If you've been living under a rock for the last 10+ years, then this book might be useful to you. The book targets console programmers (as in scrolling text, not games!) who are making the big leap to graphical user interface style programs. If you've used a computer in the last ten years, you probably know everything this book mentions. That said, from a historical perspective it _was_ worth the hour of time to read the book."
4,good book for any tractor lover,"if you have someone who loves tractors, the history of them especially, they will love this book. The person I purchased it for was very happy with and goes back to it time and again."
4,Do yourself a favor...,"At the time of this review, there are used copies of this album available on Amazon for $.48! Do yourself a favor and get a copy for the price of a soda. Great album that most have never heard of. Saw this band years ago opening for Vision of Disorder and Bloodlet. They come from the NYHC scene, but have a lot more complexity to their sound. After you check these guys out, go find the singers previous band - MIND OVER MATTER. ditl... fun fact: the bass player has a twin brother who was the bass player for Vision of Disorder."
1,Not well done at all!,"This book offers pages of the history of operating systems, including the future of Windows, in great detail. The author should have put that much thought into the discussion of networking with Windows XP. There are some instructions, not very well written, but this author doesn't seem to understand how owners of several computers approach creating small networks. There's no discussion of why you would take a specific approach, or when you need to take specific steps.I also bought Home Networking for Dummies, which is the most well-designed approach to networking I've read. If you want to know when to do something, how to do it, why to do it, and read extremely well-written instructions that anyone could follow, don't buy this book, buy Home Networking for Dummies instead."
3,A bit too simplistic,"I bought this book based onthe previous review; however, I found it to be too simple and superficial to get a real grasp of home networking processes and concepts. It'll tell you how to do it, but not great explanations about why.I recommend Moulton's SOHO Networking (2002) instead."
3,not their most memorable work.,"first of all, this is not the jimmy eat world you think you know. if you just finished listening to bleed american or futures and are looking into buying this cd, stop right now, this cd isn't for you.for those who are fans of jimmy's earlier work this is an intriguing collection of songs in the same vein as static prevails. the problem is, it's hardly as memorable as there isn't a single stand out track in the group. it's surely interesting, but not necessarily worth your time.jebediah's contribution at the end of the split cd isn't much better. the only song worth listening to is the ending track, ""harpoon"" and even that will have you searching for where you last placed jimmy's prized album, clarity.if you're a rabid fan of this band, or an obsessive collector, you may want to pick this one up. but if you're a music fan, you should probably skip over this lackluster effort."
5,Don't Adopt Without Reading This!,"This book is the most important investment we made when we decided to adopt our daughters. It is relatively easy to understand, the tables are helpful, and the understanding it provides as to who is actually paying for your AAP, provides the adoptive parent with the tools to negotiate an AAP agreement that will truly be beneficial for all parties involved. Child welfare workers, adoption workers, etc. are not well-versed on this topic and may present the basic rate to you as the only thing available. Read on...adoption is a win/win situation when you understand your rights financially. Read this and then negotiate your AAP agreement armed with accurate information. The only thing I would recommend is that the authors should update the tables to a more current year's standard. Regardless - this book is an absolute necessity for adoptive parents."
5,why dont u make the movie cheaper,its a very good movie but like i said why dont u make the movie cheaper than more people will buy it cause who would pay 90 bucks for a movie when u can probly get it in the video store for 10 bucks
3,Not Bad,"This movie is a story about two runners who have gone on separate paths, but now they are reunited again. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. It's worth a look if you're a runner."
2,OK movie,I bet Brad Pitt tries to forget this movie. Its not a terrible movie but it has a very low budget feel. I was high school track and cross country runner so I figured I would at least check it out.
3,"Wouldn't you know it? A great Track movie, too","Seeing this movie for the first time when it finally made its way to cable-tv, I was first showing my potential in being a star runner myself. I was enthralled that I'd actually found a movie based upon high school track, and quite surprised to see The Artist Formerly Known as Ricky as the reforming thug. Yet, in the midst of the emotional turmoil within that family, I was moved, and stirred by watching the sport itself. Knowing what was going through that characters mind as he raced around the track. Feeling the same emotions sitting in front of the screen as I did when my foot landed on the rubber of the track. We have since seen a few other track related movies, but this one remains to be the best, and the easiest to relate to for anyone with the passion for the sport."
4,across the Tracks,I enjoyed the movie. It was fun to watch Rick Schroeder and brad Pitt in roles as teenagers and the movie had a good story line.
2,"Still worth it for the anthem ""Flowing""","Strobe! Sweat! Action! Bodies! This must be the definitive anthem for the night: ""Flowing"". If you don't have it, GET IT NOW. Unfortunately the rest of this album is close to BS. 6 stars for ""Flowing"", 2 for the rest."
4,Nice wall plate,"This is a nicely made wall plate to replace a cheap, beige plastic one that cracked.My only complaint is that the cable connection isn't tight - the plastic plate had a built-in spacer for the gap between the threads on the coaxial connection, and this wall plate didn't, so the coaxial is loose. This can easily be remedied with the proper-size spacer washer - I just haven't had the chance to pick one up."
3,pretty catchy song,there is something about Kelly Clarkson that makes me always take notice when she sings. she doesn't sound Novelty at all&has truly distance herself from American Idol. I like Her voice&this song is pretty Good&catchy. it's the kind of song that wouldn't be out of place from the Pat Benatar catelog at all.it works for Kelly. I like How She uses her voice.
3,Gone Already,"It really hasn't surprised me that all the contestants from American Idol really haven't been able to really sell bigtime, over the top. Kelly Clarkson is arguably one of those few that is fair, but not somebody that really has shined that way either. Her second single from her sophmore record Breakaway, Since You've Been Gone, isn't a perfectional breakup song. It isn't bad, but not great either. The song sounds like Kelly is trying to have a more teen pop sound, than a sound that is just one of those that can be very outrageous, like her earlier song Ms. Independent. Still, I hope she can find that range that can put her away from those acts soon.Song: C"
1,Look for the Jason Nevins Mix,"I am sorry to hear that alot of people are not aware of the ""Jason Nevin's Remix EXCELLENT"" close to 8 min long, it is out there U just need to look and search, Nevins is responsible for some of the great songs around from Ultra Nate ""Free 2005"" a bit fast though, as well as The siren Diva Anastacia's remix of ""Left Outside Alone"" EXCELLENT, also ""Sick and Tired"" very funky beat, a bit dreary at times tho. Nevins tends to take on the songs that one would never think could be a great remix, Kelly and Anastacia remixes are so HOT, very club/dance floor friendly, with a slight rock edge, not to stray from the original.Jason prof DJ"
3,kelly????,"she tries to look and sound like Christina, after all they are on the same record label. Sorry kelly Christina came first......"
1,Bugs need to be worked out.,"I wanted to use an inexpensive program for things like wedding albums, my kids pictures and such. Intitially 3D Album was a little difficult to figure out, and seemed counter-intuitive. The most difficult part of 3D Album is working through the constant crashing in the middle of using 3D Album. It seems to crash about every 5 minutes. On the plus side, I contacted the people at 3D Album and they were very helpful and friendly. Its too bad the program isn't the same. I made sure that I have the latest updates, and yet the programs still crashes. I have about 15 years of experience with computers and video editing programs. If 3D Album could do what it advertised to do for the low price, it could be a winner. A person would be wise to wait until the bugs are worked out of this program before spending hard earned money."
5,pomp and circumstance,"Nothing to say about the music, it's like the rest of his operas: Show-off without any real meaning. It's very well done, but one never really feels any sympathy, or identification, with the characters. Maybe he really only saw these years in Italy as a ""grounding"" for a later career ( Salieri adviced him to study the human voice in Italy). That would explain why the music feels so aimless."
5,Awesome book!,I enjoyed this book very much. This is the first book I have ever seen written about this particular book of the Bible. It tells the story of Hosea and Gomer as told in the book of Hosea in the Bible. The author wrote accurately in the parts that are also covered in the Bible. She wrote the details very convincingly.
2,Do Not Buy From This Seller,"Purchased product took over a month to get to me after ordering. Then, in order to even get the package, I had to pay the postman almost $15 for the postage because it was apparently not paid for previously. However,I had already paid in full when I purchased the item, so this is just a way for them to suck more money out of you apparently. Do not buy from this seller!"
3,Not Bad but not Great,"It works that is what is important, however it doesn't clean the air well enough, we had to buy a larger Air Purifier for a room that is less than 50 sq feet."
4,"Great Air Filter for price, hepa, coal, ionizer!","I have not been able to find a air filter that has all the options this filter has for a similar price. For around $20 it can't be beat.Cons: It's a little loud on full blast (as expected).Pros: Good price, good quality, good filtering. I actually ran it in my basement for an entire weekend and it made a difference in the musty smell.Summary: Great little air filter for the price, sturdy and a good buy!"
2,painful yet enduring,"If ever a book was in dire need of a strong editor, this is it! Without any editorial experience I could easily slash a good half of this book. But it is the other half that kept me at it. I purchased the book because of the promise of the story within. And the underlying story is wonderful. But Thackara really needs to get over himself! A lot of the writing is utter conceit, literary posturing to be expected from a high school literature teacher/frustrated novelist, not from someone who actually got these 800 pages published. Too bad. It could easily have been a really great book."
2,A Maid's Friends and Fantasies: Devlin O'Neill's Short Stories,"O'neill's stories grow old after the first book. I read his books out of order. I enjoyed the first one I read and promptly bought the rest of his volumes and the short stories. The plots tend to stay the same. Annoyingly, these women (and I emphasis women) act like spoiled children just for the benefit of being punished. Adult women speaking as if they infants is really insane. The refering to female genitial as 'gina is a total turn off!!!!!!! I felt as if I were reading the contexts of a wannabe online BD/SM chatroom. O'Neill needs to get a real life and quit hanging on the net as it is reflected in his stories. He puts a new spin on fiction."
3,igourmet let me down,"These chocolates are actually five-star. However igourmet sent a package that was old, with some of the chocolates broken. I was disappointed with their product, not THE product. Bohme is excellent."
3,Hitchcock Thrillers,"These movies are ok. My husband loves old classic movies, me not so much. I read one of the books that was made into a Hitchcock movie. I'm sorry to say I fell asleep during the movie and they arn't very long! :("
3,1 more star?,"This is a good movie and I liked it, especially the very likable protagonists. I would like it more if someone would be so kind as to explain why the 'Germans' don't just arrest Miss Froy? Why go through the trouble of 'disappearing' her? Yes, if they had done so the story wouldn't exist. Why does the villain never just kill the hero but instead leaves an unintended escape... sure, we suspend disbelief up to a point, but here with this movie, I wonder if I had just missed a key dialog or something of that sort."
4,First Class Mystery,"Very entertaining, good acting and character portrayal. Had some predictable circumstances but for the 1930's outstanding."
5,Cool Plot,"this movie is really engrossing to watch and i enjoy the musical aspect of the movie. don't pass it by just because its old, its a classic."
2,Great film - poor transfer.,"This is *not* the Criterion Collection eition. THE LADY VANISHES is truly the greatest film of Hitchcock's British period, and one of his best films overall. While the source materials are of fine quality (good clean print of the film with nice contrasts and good sound), the transfer leaves much to be desired. I have seen VHS versions which were more pleasing to the eye and this DVD looks as though it was mastered from an old video tape. The introduction by Tony Curtis (!?) is a waste of time. Stick to the more expensive (but worth it) Criterion Collection edition."
1,"Great Movie, Bad DVD","This is an excellent movie from Hitchcock's ""English Period"". The movie has been reviewed many times already and I highly recommend it. However, this particular copy, the Lady Vanishes (Enhanced) version by Public Domain Flicks, is horrible. Very poor video and audio quality, it is impossible to figure out what was ""Enhanced"" on this DVD. The sound is muddy and the video is very soft. Certainly not worth the asking price. The only thing that would make this DVD worth purchasing would be to get it in the discount bin at Walmart for less than $5. I guarantee you will be disappointed with this copy. Spend a little more and get the Criterion version and you won't regret it."
4,In glorious black and white,"The film opened to what seemed to be a model town complete with a toy automobile or two. But, this was the release which put Alfred back into film production.The viewing gets off to a slow start. In fact, if you are a first time viewer, you may wish to download the Wikipedia summary and character credits.But,the film has it all: A strangled guitar player, pre-WWII spies of dubious allegiance, doctored drinks, an ersatz nun who switches sides, a shootout in the woods, a happy ending, several laughs, and folks who insist upon opening the sash, even though they are in the middle of winter. And, of course, the vanishing lady...Watch for Alfred, as our heroic couple debark the train.An enjoyable film which picks up steam as it goes. Viewing and sound quality are quite adequate.One reviewer objected to commentary on the second disc, but the easy solution is not to view it."
4,Flawed but Improved Restoration,"The restoration that is done is by removing scratches, but the film still suffers from graininess. No doubt that within a decade, the use of computers will be able to fully restore these films by filling in all the missing dots.The Lady Vanishes is one of the most imitated films ever. Basil Radford and Naunton Wayne are great as the homosexual pair disdaining almost everything. And Margaret Lockwood shines as one of the great (though little known) beauties of the century, somewhat of a cross between Myrna Loy and Vivian Leigh . All three were reunited in Carol Reed's Night Train to Munich just two years later.It might be interesting to compare the performances of Radford and Wayne to that of Jim Parsons in the Big Bang Theory. What we take for granted in film today was built upon the reels of the past. If everything were so obvious from the start, the Wright brothers would just have built a stealth bomber at Kittyhawk."
1,Don't buy the cheap version!,"The ""Platinum Disc Corp."" version is a waste of $8. The sound quality is horrible: even with the volume all the way up I could barely make out the dialogue. I guess they used a bad old print and didn't bother to clean up the audio track. They saved money, but you'd be wasting yours. (The one star is for this DVD transfer, not the movie, which is fun. I also recommend ""Night Train to Munich,"" which reunites so much of the cast that it's almost a sequel.)"
3,Hitchcocks Lady Vanishes,"Criterion transfer to Blu-ray OK, but wish it had been done in a 9x16 format instead of 4x3 as it was done originally."
5,Wonderful!,hitchcock i must say started his REAL directing when he made this film! very good and cleaver...also very funny with the British humor!
1,not all regions DVD,"This is not a review about those Hitch films. It is just a warning for future customers outside of the USA/Canada . THIS IS NOT AN ALL REGIONS DVD, although it is shown as such on the DVD case."
4,Criterion version is worth the money,Criterion do a good job on this film and is the one to get.I have never seen a laserlight DVD of a classic film that wasn't a poorly copied washed out version.
5,My all-time favorite Hitchcock!,"This is a great combination of suspense and comedy. A girl gets a bump on the head intended for someone else just before boarding a train and is helped by an elderly English woman. But shortly after boarding the train, the lady vanishes! Was the girl hallucinating after the bump on the head or did the lady really disappear? This story has everything--sharp, witty dialogue, spies, suspense and drama. In between the darker moments, two hilarious Englishmen, Charters and Caldicott nearly steal the show. This is one movie that I never get tired of watching!"
5,A Ravishing Charmer That's Astonishingly Good,"The script is especially witty, with tingling suspense and surprise delivered at all the crucial moments. ""The Lady Vanishes"" is an early Hitchcock beauty that would have caused a comic romance master like Lubitsch to look back over his shoulder with envy. Hitchcock attempted a few other comic-suspense pieces later in his career such as ""Mr and Mrs Smith,"" ""The Trouble with Harry"" amd ""Family Plot."" None equal ""The Lady Vanishes,"" its charms undiminished nearly seven decades later. Sheer delight!"
4,Great bag,"This is a great diaper bag that doesn't look like a diaper bag. It's the perfect size for a day-long outing. I can fill it with a couple of receiving blankets, a few outfits for the baby, some diapers, wipes, milk, and some other odds and ends. The plastic wipe compartment seems pretty cheap and can be a pain to open and close. It is nice having access to the wipes from the outside of the bag though. I wish it had an insulated compartment for keeping ice packs and milk. I think a regular messenger bag of the same size could serve the same function as this DadGear bag but I still highly recommend this."
1,empty bag is too heavy alone,"we ended up returning this one and purchasing a Columbia diaper bag as at babies r us with the warranty (heard sometimes zippers are an issue, but not on ours yet). the Columbia one is black and super lightweight and has a strap both hubby and i can put over our heads like a messenger bag."
3,Item not as described,"I bought this bag from another retailer based on the description here on Amazon.com. the Courier Diaper bag does not have the zippered bottle pockets. It also does not have the 2 outside pockets under the flap. And it's small - not big enough for a full day out at all IMO. We returned it to the original retailer. If you're looking for a smallish short excursion bag, this would work fine."
4,love everything but the wipe holder,"love the bag, especially since it's over the shoulder. i've seen too many peeps with regular shoulder bags sliding down their arm while trying to hold a car seat or baby. it has a lot of compartments to keep stuff organized and still have enough space in the big pocket for formula and diapers.i have to stop using the wipe holder tho. it has always been so hard to open, i took skin off my finger today trying to open it. and it's very hard to fill the wipe holder too. i haven't found a way to actually remove the holder, so i'll probably just take the back off (so there's not a giant hole in my bag) and use a regular wipe holder inside the bag."
2,"Cool, but not durable","We got this diaper bag for our first child mainly because my husband is the stay-at-home dad and and I wanted him to feel comfortable walking around with the diaper bag. While the bag looks cool, and lasted for the first three months of our son's life, I've been overall disappointed with the size, feeling like we needed to fight with the bag to close it every time we went everywhere, and yesterday was the final straw when the shoulder strap broke in the middle of the sidewalk. I think this bag is just not meant to be a primary diaper bag. It's difficult to fit everything you need in your primary diaper bag and still close both straps. I often found myself just closing one strap and letting the other hang to make it work. This will probably work as a ""dad bag"" where you're packing the bare essentials for a father/baby outing, but I wouldn't recommend it as an everyday use bag."
2,Cheaply made,"This is a good looking diaper bag and holds most everything we need. The problem is that it is very cheaply made. Like another reviewer posted, there is a hole in the back of the bag where the seam ripped out after picking it up by the handle. We've only been using this diaper bag for about 6 months, but this hole appeared after only a couple months of using. This bag probably won't last until our daughter's first birthday since the hole in the back keeps getting larger.Also, the wipe holder no longer stays closed and is essentially useless now. We just throw our own pack of wipes in the bag now.We are pretty disappointed in this item."
3,"We like it, but its not perfect.",This bag is plenty big and easy to carry. However the built in wipe container isn't sealed well enough for the wipes to stay wet in a low humidity environment (We live in the Southwest). For the high price we paid for this bag I expected it to function as well as a $2 wipe box you can get at the grocery store.
4,Diaper Bag,"This bag is perfect for us. It's just our style. It can be a little tight at times, but we tend to be light packers. We cloth diaper, so that takes up a lot of space on day trips, but we breast feed as well so we don't have bottles and formula taking up space either."
4,endtime flow,"I was expectng a clear cut linkage with connective verses thru out and that was pretty much what I found. To me this book clarified many things from other books and made more fluent the sequence of endtime, From the prewrath perspective it has helped me."
4,very different and original music,"I am a fan of good music like enigms,deep forest,vangelis,pink floyd,wes and other artists like these. When i heard mychael danna or the first time in Exotica, I was stunned by his originality. Same is with the Kamasutra. It is great music."
2,Warning: beautiful but porous,"These bowls are beautiful. I love their size and appearance.Unfortunately, they appear to have been fired at a low temperature, which means that they are porous; consequently, when you wash them, water soaks in under the glaze. I am returning mine."
3,The Guilt Trip,"The material in the book is excellent, however, it is not worththe price you have to pay for the book when it is simply a chapter from Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth. The book is a total of 47 pages. Unless you want it for a collection just buy the original book, Satan is Alive and Well on Planet Earth."
2,Not My Favorite by Lorna Landvik,"For me not one of my favorite books by Lorna Landvik. I felt it just dragged on for ever with not much of a story. I only finished the book because I bought it. Although, the ending was nice. Wish she would write more books like Tall Pine Polka and Welcome to the Great Mysterious, two of my absolute favorites by Lorna Landvik"
4,"touching, engaging yet slow in parts","There were too many dragging parts of the book for me to give it a 5 star read but it was still enjoyable; the characters were well-defined and I warmed up to Violet as the book progressed. There is quite abit of bad luck that plagues Violet from page one but her life, as the story weaves from future to flashbacks, is surely never a dull moment if it is a sad one.Landvik is queen at storytelling and I look forward to more of her books."
3,Good but Forgettable.,"Save this book for a rainy day. The main characters - Violet, Kjel, Austin, and Dallas - are all sympathetic, but slightly underwritten. It was a nice story, but nothing to sink your teeth into. I particularly felt that the author was thinking of what a nice Lifetime movie this would make as she got deeper into the book. How else to explain the immediate transference of love and loyalties following a tragedy befalling one of the characters? (When you read it, see what I mean, and try and tell me that I'm wrong.) The author seemed to run out of plot 3/4 of the way into the book, and cobbled together a hasty ending that not only didn't jibe with the rest of the story. It was a good read, but not satisfying, and completely forgettable 24 hours after reading it."
5,Another Winner from Lorna!,I was hooked on Ms. Landvik after reading Patti Jane's House of Curl. This is another great read from her. The first chapter was a little hard to get into but I was quickly hooked! And very surprised with the turns the book took. I have to agree with the reviewer's remark about the historical information. I read things I had no idea about! The characters are real and unforgettable. I highly recommend this book.
3,Not a bad book,"While I was a huge fan of ""Patty Jane's House of Curl""....this book doesn't quite measure up to it. I did enjoy the plot as far as Violet goes...the rest was just tedious reading and i wanted to be finished quicker than i was."
2,"No, no","This book is very slow and depressing. It starts off good in the beginning, but then it slows way down. By the time the accident happened, I was so bored, I had to stop reading."
3,Not Ladvik's best effort,"I have read all of Lorna Landvik's book and was anxiously awaiting a new one. Oh My Stars was a fairly good story, but there were so many editorial errors in the book, I almost wondered at one point if the story had changed or Violet's loss of her arm was a joke. On more than one occasion she supposedly ""wiped her hands"" or ""wrapped her arms around"" something. This just sounded ridiculous for a one-armed character. A little more careful editing would have improved the continuity quite a bit. I much preferred Tall Pine Polka and Angry Housewives Eating Bonbons. Note to editor... Don't be in too big a hurry to hit the shelves!"
4,A nice story,"In general I liked this book quite a bit. Landvik's books always seem to have that ""feel good"" vibe to them. The characters are well written and the story, although at times a little implausible, (I would have thought that Violet and the Pearltones would have encountered a bit more racism and bigotry on their travels,) nicely told. Violet was a great character and I found myself rooting for her throughout the book.There were a few too many ""around the campfire"" scenes that really should have been edited better, but on the whole, this was a very enjoyable book to read."
3,I want Patty Jane!,"While this book was not bad, it just did not measure up to the first book of Landvik's which I read, ""Patty Jane's House of Curl"". I loved that book, but merely liked this latest one. I found parts of it to be verrrrrrry slow and just wanted to get to the end. It took me 10 days to read it, which to me says ""this is not a book that was compelling"".The synopsis has already been written several times, so I will not go into that....suffice it to say that the story was ""just okay"" in my opinion. I liked Violet and ""the boys"" but they were not nearly as fleshed-out as Patty Jane and her family and friends.I also felt that after dragging out the story of the first couple of years, the book/ story was concluded too rapidly."
4,Fast & Easy,"When it comes to painting, I don't have a lot of patience especially if the room is large. I bought this paintstick on a recommendation, but I did have my doubts. After I taped off the room and cut in the corners, I was ready to use my new paintstick. The instructions for putting it together were a bit confusing but by looking at the picture on the box, I had it put together in a few minutes. All you do is flip the lever to 'fill' and pull back the plunger and the paintstick is filled with paint. In a 12 x 12 room, I had the first coat on in about 10 minutes.. if that. The best part is that there's no mess. I don't know how well it would work in a small room such as a powder room but I am recommending this thing to everyone!I would have given it five stars but cleaning this paintstick is kind of a pain. When you're cleaning it, make sure you're doing it in a room that you don't mind getting messy."
1,EZ-Twist major problem,If you are planning to use ordinary high quality paint thats thicker than water then you will have problems within one hour of using this product. I quickly clogs up and then seizes up. Less than a gallon of paint and it frozen solid. A strip down reveals dried pain on the plunger seal and plugged up tubes. The tube also has dried paint this glues the assembly solid. An hour of cleaning and its pretty clear this is a bad design not intended for high quality paint and certainly only going to work with paint that really is like water. Forget fast drying paints or one coat paints they will glue the plunger in that tube in next to no time.
4,Gosple Spirit Bill Monroe& His Blue Grass Boys,l enjoyed in a lot l listern to him on blue grass radio and like all his music would recomend to all
5,Adirondacks By The Seasons,"Photographer John E. Winkler has produced a fine collection of breathtaking photographs shown in the motif of the four seasons. All portions of the Adirondack wilderness are represented from the High Peaks, to the southern Adirondacks to the Bob Marshall wilderness. Colorful scenes of dramatic peaks, crevassed cliffs and magnificent viewsheds are matched with close-up shots of a variety of flora at its' showiest. One of the best Adirondack photography books available, this is a coffee table book to treasure."
1,doesn't seem to work here in maui,I was really looking forward to having this in our home.After a month of use it seems the old fashion mouse trap is what works:(There is a season during the year where they are a problem on the island so I hoped to avoid it natually with this product but after a month of use we are still catching a few a week.Too bad and to costly to return.
1,Does not work!,"This item does not work at all. They tried to convince me to keep the product by saying that ""bugs were coming out of the wall due to the sound."" Nope. The product simply does not work! Plus, it creates this horrible high pitched sound that's supposed to be inaudible to humans. Do not buy this product!"
1,does not work,"bought a similiar product, does not work, still see a lot of dropings, waste of money."
1,worse than useless,"I bought this and found that it is audible and unbearable to my young adult children. My daughter contacted the company, who explained that usually if it is audible, then it is a defective unit, so we wrapped it, bought postage and sent it back. The replacement unit is no better. I cannot say whether it works, since I cannot use it in this house without repelling the humans who live here."
1,5 in 1 Pest Repeller PC51 - Ultimate Pestcontro Unit,Right to the point! It does NOT work as promised and it is annoyingly noisy.
1,Don't rent it,"This movie has no plot, no story, nothing. We went to see it in the theater and left half way through it. This is the only movie we have actually left the theater it was so bad. Don't waste your money."
5,Laughed My Tush Off!,"I admit I'd never even heard of this movie until about a month ago when I saw it on a movie channel on TV and decided to give it a watch. I was shocked I'd never seen nor even heard of it before, especially with such a good cast. One of those old classic feel good and laugh out loud type of movies that are few and far between these days. Almost like My Cousin Vinnie in a sense."
2,This is subpar,"Don't get me wrong. I like Michael Richards(Seinfeld is my second favorite show of all time just below the Simpsons) but this is altogether too ho hum. I never laughed out loud once during this entire movie. There were a few parts that were mildly amusing but the movie could never seem to build any momentum. Just when it would seem like it was getting good it would switch to a scene with Jeff Daniels and suddenly not so funny. Jeff Daniels best comedic role is, of corse, Dumb and dumber and he has a few good moments here but mostly he just plays the straight guy and his scenes just seem to drag the movie down. But I suppose if you like romantic comedy fluff you might not totally hate this movie"
2,Hmm...,"I probably wouldn't have seen this movie if it hadn't been for Michael Richards (Seinfeld's Kramer). And I would have been right not to do so, because the only thing that makes this film even remotely funny is Richards enormeous talent for physical comedy. He can do the most amazing things with his face and body, and during the first third of the film you get to laugh a lot. But then it gets boring. After that the film tries to tell a story that no one want's to hear. Had it instead concentrated on Richards efforts as the world's worst lawyer, and how he tries to defend the world's dumbest criminal, this film might have been really good. As it is it's hardly worth seeing."
3,Trial and Error,"I got mine free, Worth to watch Michael Richards(Kramer-Seinfeld) is in it. he's funny and the movie ain't so bad.so rent it or watch it first."
4,Ganesh Mantra,"Beautiful, gentle and one of my favourite albums. Great harmonies on this well recorded collection of devotional music. What an antidote to long day at work!"
4,Very soothing,"I downloaded this album to supply some background music when I was getting a Ganesh tattoo done. It helped me go into a meditative state even though the tattoo pain was fairly intense. While that is not a mainstream purpose for this music, I do recommend it.I have since listened to the album without distractions. It is very peaceful and promotes meditation on Sri Ganesh.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that I would have liked it more if the Ganesh Mahamantra track was, let's say, 30 minutes."
5,beautiful,"A beautiful mix of both haunting chillout and the best of dance/lounge, I bought this without even listening to it first and I love it! Fans of Nitin Sawhney/Buddha bar will love this."
3,Uninspiring,"I listen to a lot of compilations from George V, Cafe Del Mar, Pschent/Wagram and the like, sometimes going as far as the original recordings by the artistes featured on these CDs. Ravin is a shining star of this genre - of this I have no doubt. However, Huvafen Fushi Maldives was, for me, a disappointment. It did not appeal on an emotional level (as Siddharta did, for instance). I found the tracks ordinary and uninspiring - much the same way as I felt about Pompougnac's Saks Fifth Avenue."
3,"Not what I expected, but I thought it would be better","I had somewhat high expectations of this book as a bizarre, quaint little tale from a mind who created the marvelous film, ""The Madness of King George.""The book itself was enjoyable, but I would not read it again or recommend it to a friend. Bennett could benefit from some punctuation, as some of his sentences are run-ons or are nonsensical (I'm sorry, but I'm an editor). The satire of the British middle class, Britain in general, and various types of people is the best part about the book. It is intelligent in that way.My biggest disappointment was that the bizarre tale climaxed (when the reader finds out how, by whom, and why all of the Ransomes' possessions were stolen) in a way that did not fit with the rest of story and, indeed, did not add anything to it.The characters are high quality, however, in a book that is so small and fluid."
1,Muppet Frida,"This album sounds like teh muppets from space. Great fun, but not to be taken seriously. One starts to wonder why she got involved in ABBA. When they have a brilliant singer in the band why add a bad backing vocalist like Frida?"
5,Great!!!,"If you love the movie, then you will absolutely love the soundtrack. This has all of the songs from the movie and every song reminds you of the movie. Also, it's a great way to learn a little french. =)"
3,"Not a bad read, but not what a true baseball gambler needs!","Not a bad read, but not what a true baseball gambler needs! I'm a follow Author (here on Amazon.com), and I must admit that this Roman guy is quite the historian. But, beyond that, this book lacks any real helpful advice on how to increase ones bankroll, or simply become a better baseball gambler. The writing I thought was a bit benign and even borderline rudimentary. If you love baseball history, this is a decent book to own. But again (at the risk of sounding redundant), Mr. Roman fails miserably with his inept brand of baseball wagering strategies. I gave it 3-stars on the basis that is WAS a slightly entertaining read.Signed,Joseph J Tuttle"
2,Not quite worth it,"In full honesty, I thought I had order one pound of sanding sugar (at the same price) and was a little confused when I opened the box. Since I really didn't need a pound, I decided to keep this product. I agree with the other review that rated these expensive for what they are -- just slightly colored sugar.I sprinkled them on my daughter's birthday cake and she liked them. A few minutes (10 at the most) later when we cut the cake, the had already melted/dissolved into the frosting. I used them on white frosting and they were very had to see, even at application.Bottom line: I would not recommend this product."
1,Girls of Hawaii falls short of expectation,"Girls of Hawaii, along with the other bikini Beach Party videos are cool, but the footage you see can be shown on the USA network.I was disappointed that there were no extra, non-rated scenes that would make this video extra ""Special""The Girls are hot, but don't expect them take anthing off."
3,"General info, don't expect depth!","A decent overview of sciatica, causes, syptoms, treatments. Trippy that it even lists several ""alternative"" therapies. Too bad information about sciatica is so scarce. Book is okay, doesn't go into depth, however. If it hadn't been a present from a concerned friend, I think I'd have returned it for a refund. But, if you just don't know anything at all, this book will give you more information that you currently have."
2,"Good for symptoms, but....","I wasted my money on this book before I read John Sarno, M.D.'s book ""Healing Back Pain"". Well, it turns out that Sciatica is clearly part of TMS, which is what I have. Look up the Sarno book here at amazon, and read the reviews. The Sarno book has helped hundreds of people be free of both back AND SCIATIC pain. I am not yet 100% pain free, but I am living an unrestricted, active life without fear. Don't just treat the symptoms -- read Sarno's book and be cured!!!!!"
4,Perfect for the Layman,"Sometimes the illustrations in this book are a little silly, but it presents information in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. It gives a good overview of many different kinds of treatment and how they can help the different causes of sciatica. The exercises depicted in the book and excellent."
2,"Too simple, sometimes inaccurate and changes focus.","This book simply ""skims"" the issue of sciatica. It barely touches on extraspinal causes of radiculpathy which medical science is beginning to address. The alternative medicine section was a fairly well-written overview, but corelational studies are lacking. If you are looking for a simple book in a non-medical setting, then maybe this book is a good place to start. And by the way, the author, while accomplished in other works, seems to lack a medical background."
5,Superb Common Sense Understanding,Book is simplied with everyday language to help us understand what to do if and when our back or hurting or with pain we are not used to having...There are an abundance of simple illustrations which make the book easy for us (NON-Doctors) to understand...

1,F4:Vortex,It is obvious the movie was made in German and dubbed in English. You could see that by watching the actor's lips. The conflict between father and son was not the best written. That I think comes from the dubbing and the writting of the movie. Had I know it was like this I would not have purchased it.
3,F4 VORTEX,IT CAME IN THE MAIL VERY QUICKLY AND IT WAS IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.FOR AN ACTION PACK MOVIE SEEM TO FAR OUT THEIR.
2,F4GETTABLE,"This 3 hour TV movie from Germany is dubbed and dumb. The back stories occupy 2/3 of the movie and are as exciting as a root canal.The effects are below average and by the time the tornadoes reach Berlin, who cares?The dubbing is so bad it's hard to judge the performances. Every cliche in the book is found in this dud. A 3 hour waste of time."
2,f4:vortex,was not very interesting and would not keep you interested in movie. would not advise to buy or rent movie to watch unless you like dull movies.
4,A decent knock-off,"Obviously Seuss inspired. I don't object to the homage, just that it seems like they're trying to trick you into buying it by implying the author is Seuss... which it is not, nor is the illustrator.That said, it's still a cute book. Good rhymes and lots of animals (the real kind, not the fanciful kind). My daughter likes it, and I enjoy reading it to her. Sweet and fun... but what's with the bat on the last page? ""And one thing more, suppose no nose: where would all our glasses sit? They'd fall off! Just think of it!"" Doesn't really hold water if you're hanging upside down! Silly nitpick, I know!"
5,Excellent reading,"I subscribe to Spider, Cricket, Muse, and Odyssey magazines from the same publisher. These are all excellent magazines that totally captivate my children. It's amazing to see their faces light up when a new issue arrives in the mail. This is the best gift you could give a child to encourage them to read. There are no advertisements to distract your children. I am 200% satisfied!"
2,not impressed,I actually heard Jaime speak at a conference I was at a few years ago. He was a GREAT speaker. After hearing him speak I really wanted to read his books. I wasn't really impressed with this one. It was dry. Kind of boring.
3,Good for 1st time author,"The story idea is good, the lingo is pretty catchy but like many first time authors, the dialogue is stilted and too much information that is not necessary to the story. I did get my local library to buy it which is a plus for the author since she will get much wider circulation through libraries. For a first time author, it's successful but cannot give it anything close to five stars - but I hope she continues writing and looking forward to seeing her work in the future as she masters the process."
3,C130,"EYEPIECE HAS A NOTICABLE BROWN CAST TO IT, CONTACTED CELESTRON THEY INDICATED THAT WAS NORMAL....?"
2,Pretty,"Competent piano playing, but I had hoped this kind of prissy, superficial playing went out with Rosalyn Tureck and her ilk. Bach shouldn't sound ""pretty""! Listen to how she drains all the drama from the gigue of the E-minor suite, then listen to Murray Perahia play it with amazing rhythmic sublety and drama, letting all the voices speak."
1,not for young readers,"I urge parents to read through this magazine before letting your young readers read it. I bought this for my 10 year old daughter. Our first issue was Feb. I was not happy to read a story that mentioned girls teasing about a girl being ""a wanna be boy"" & having a sex change. This should not be in a magazine geared towards this age range. I cancelled our subscription."
3,Shipping delay,"I was disheartened to read multiple reviewer's comments that it took several months for their subscription to arrive, and Amazon's own statement on the product page that it would take 12-16 weeks to ship. The Cricket magazine's own website ships at the same price as Amazon and promised 4 week delivery. I chose to order from their site instead."
2,Delivery disappointment,I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my nephew on Dec. 16th. I was informed after I placed the order that the first issue wouldn't be delivered until April. I'm extremely disappointed that my nephew won't get his first issue until 4 months after Christmas.
2,Long delivery time,"Just to let the first time Cricket orderer know, they quote 3 to 4 months to deliver. It took **5** months for my niece to receive her birthday gift. I was not pleased. Hopefully it's worth the wait."
3,Why so slow?,We're psyched to read Cricket - it sounds great for our 7 year old bookish son - but it's been more than a month and we've yet to see an issue of Cricket in the mail. Why does the subscription process take so long?
5,Amazing magazine - well worth the money,"Although the target audience is stated to be 8-12 year old, my seven year old is completely fascinated with this magazine. She has thanked me countless times for the subscription and looks forward to each month with anticipation. Not only are the stories lively and entertaining, they are educational as well (I am also learning various things about history and culture that I did not know before!). There is a good mix of fiction and non fiction stories as well as poetry. Since receiving this magazine, I have noticed her excelling more at reading comprehension and her own story writing skills. These reasons are why I believe it is well worth the money and I wll be renewing our subscription for a very long time."
1,Fell apart,"I bought one to do my deck and it worked great on half of it and then the pad started coming off which let the stain flow freely, so I went back to Lowe's to buy a replacement pad and they don't carry them so I bought another stain stick. when I finished the other half I looked at the head and it's starting to come off also. I still have one or two more coats to but on with something else. Don't waste your money like I did."
5,Professional Quality Finish,"I am so impressed with the finish that this product provides. Each year I apply a fresh coat of stain to my deck boards and I always used a brush, until I found this product. I was so impressed with the smooth even finish that it provided. I couldn't believe there were no brush strokes. For years I was use to seeing the brush strokes, now it looks like I hired a professional to stain my deck. This product also speed up the staining process, I couldn't believe how fast I got the job done with the stain stick.Home Right C800418 Stain Stick"
1,Replacement Pads???,"I used two sticks, the included four pads (two per stick) and finished half of my (large) deck. The sticks work fairly well, but two out of pads leaked badly or came unattached. Now I can't find replacement pads and have two worthless sticks. Finished my deck by hand."
2,Be ready to purchase replacement pads,The tool works well for about 20 minutes and then the pad begins to tear apart and leak stain. Frustrating.
1,Look for another way to spread stain.,"I have just wasted an hour with tool and i am so mad that Homeright and Home Depot got my money. Task: deck floor, semi transparent stain, 88 sq.ft. It is impossible to control the flow and carrying the head back for the next stroke invariably dropped stain, then to try to blend in the drops, it over delivers stain since it can't be readily controlled. not to mention that as you deplete the supply in the tube it gets shorter. [They should warn anyone over 3ft6 not to attempt to use this tool. The pivot head does not pivot freely [it's made in China after all].Please do not waste your time or money on this product. And BTW although I am not a professional painter, I am not exactly new to the task I have been painting and staining interiors and exteriors of homes we've owned for 33 years. [that said, I should have known better!]"
3,Great Boards come with Great problems ><,"Overall, this is an excellent board, if you get one that works well that is.EVGA does have an excellent RMA program, just make sure you register within 30 days of purchase to get the lifetime warrenty with free cross-shipping.Many of these boards have been known to be ram killers for high voltage ram. Unfortunetly I got one of these boards, which killed my OCZ PC8500 ram. So I need to RMA the mobo and ram. Check out the EVGA forums on their website for more info. PC6400 (DDR2 800mhz) seem to work well. Pretty good support from EVGA. BTW, this board has been replaced with a new revision: 122-CK-NF68-A1, which fixes or improves OC ability for quad core CPU users. I hear there are other improvements. However, EVGA has not acknowledged them. Good board overall, but there may be chance you get a bad board. When these suckers are up and running, excellent board."
5,Best Mother Board ever..,"Wow. this motherboard is awesome... you can do everything with it.. of course you need to have a good processor with this mother board because it deserves it... Overclocking... raeelly easy with a software(forget about steping into the BIOS) , (network ports) for a better and faster internet conection...If you buy it.. make sure you enjoy it"
5,Super Pool,My granddaughter is 2 and this was for her birthday. She loved the shallow end. My son is 36 and very much challenged but really likes the water. He uses the deeper end. Perfect for the both of them. It took about 30 minutes to inflate with a hand pump and about another 20 minutes to fill with water. The built-in water drains don't work all that great since they're on the bottom of the pool and the weight of the water prevents the water from draining. So just push down on one side of the pool and the water spills over the top. Altogether takes about 10 minutes to drain.
1,Flimsly sides makes this hard to fill,My In-Laws bought this for my 2 year old son. It's very hard to fill because the walls just fall over until there is at least 3 inches of water in it (and even then the walls aren't standing up straight). My 2 year old couldn't get in an out on his own because the sides are high so there was a lot of lifting him in and out of the pool. Also it's hard to keep clean.
4,Awesome!,I give the cd 4 stars but the movie definetly deserves more than 5. It was a great cd with a mix of awesome artists with a lot of talent. The best song is Red Right Hand.
5,It's a SCREAM baby!!!!!,"Hello! Every song on this soundtrack is worth listening to at least once! My particular favorites are ""Red Right Hand"" by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, ""Bitter Pill,"" ""Artificial World"" ""Youth of America"" and basically all of the songs! So enjoy! This sountrack is NOT a waste of money!"
3,It's not a scream but pretty good,I used to listen to this all the time when I first bought it but not that much anymore as the songs have dated a little. It has some great songs on it such as Birdbrain's Youth of America and Nick Cave's Red Right Hand (you may have heard this in the X-files).It is a good soundtrack if you want to be in a dark mood for writing horror stories or for halloween or something. Most songs contain lyrics but there are a few instrumental ones.It has a few small photographs from the movie inside the single page album cover.If you're a huge fan of the movie you will want this one if your not you probably don't.
3,An other martial arts movie with a twist.,"Bloodfist is yes another karate movie. But Most of the cast are actual karate champs. Don "" the dragon"" Wilson is a six time WKA kickboxing Champ, and Billy Blanks(Tae bo) is a seven time Karate champ. True they need acting lessons but the fights are first rate."
4,pretty good,"I bought a blue one of these and have been very pleased with em so far.They fit wonderfully and are very snug. I have washed em frequently and they are just now starting to tear from the seams a bit at the waist in front and at one side:-( but it has been six months. I think they are the closest I have found that compare to the old ""Soft N Silent"" plastic pants. these sure do help prevent leaks that is for sure:-)"
5,Great diaper covers,These are very well made and the seams are welded . they are very durable and soft . i can wear these to work under my uniform and no one is the wiser. and for me thats every thing being is I'm incon and not really wanting to shaire that with my coworkers . I will for sure get a few more pairs.
3,"Many good songs, one excellent one.","I can't comment on the movie, but the soundtrack has got some good stuff. Five tracks from ""Thurston Moore"" are all instrumentals, and nothing like his band ""Sonic Youth"". Three from ""Evan Dando"" are typical folky for him, and he covers his idol ""Gram Parsons"" on track 15. The rest is decent filler. In my opinion, the best song on here by far is ""74-75"" by ""The Connells"". That song is near alterna-pop perfection. I would find this used."
4,Great movie- good music,"not a fan of new age music (if you can call it that) by any stretch but the Thurston Moore music was inspiring. Very evocative. My tastes in music are quite broad, and i'm glad to add this to the songs i listen to. The movie is nothing short of masterfull! What a find."
3,"not too heavy, not too light","I watched the film & Thurston's music didn't stick out too much, probably doing the job properly then. Evan Dando's an overrated git but he's okay [if you like his songs, check Smudge, Sneeze & Godstar records because Sydneysiders Tom Morgan & Nic Dalton wrote most of them from Shame About Ray onwards]. I get the feeling this review will be rejected by the advisory board but I care not."
3,What a voice.,"Evan Dando is beautiful. His rendition of ""Frying Pan"" is worth the whole album. I give Evan and his guitar five stars. Wish I could say the same for the rest."
2,For hardcore fans only who like endless detail,"This struck me as a blatant attempt to make more money off Rice's previous novels. It gives no information that fans can't get from simply re-reading the novels and reads like an encyclopedia. I recommend Ramsland's excellent bio of Anne Rice, ""Prism of the Night"" instead."
5,Excellent Book,I bought this used and it was in better shape than I had anticipated. The book itself is an excellent source for the Mayfair Witches Series.
2,A Big Disappointment -- Could Have Been Much Better,"Many famous, not-so-famous, and not-at-all-famous (the photographer's kids!)people were asked what part of them was most precious, that part subsequently being photographed for inclusion in this book. Half the pages have no photos, but are blank with only one word on them: eyes, feet, hands, etc. Far too many of the photos are blurry abstracts and could be photos of anyone. One example: Actress Miranda Otto chose her shoulders. The photo doesn't even show her shoulders, but rather a few strands of hair and the faintest suggestion of unrecognizable facial features . It tells me nothing. I purchased this book because I read that it contained a photo of Elijah Wood's eyes. Well, it does, but I have seen at least 100 more beautiful photos of this actor's spectacular eyes. I did not buy it to see a photo of the photographer's daughter's toenails. The concept of this book is terrific, but the photos are not. A pity -- it could have been so much better."
3,Not Bad - Not For Everyone,"Karunesh came as a recommendation because I enjoy Deva Premal when I want relaxation style music. The sounds from this CD are very soothing. It's not for everyone but if you're looking for something different, pick up this CD."
4,Littlest pet shop,"These little critters are so cute and the hot toy of the year with the pre-school set. My 5 year old adores them and the babies are so cute. Mini magnet make it seem like you are ""feeding"" your littlest pet."
1,"""Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid...""","In my defense, this monstrosity entered my abode recently with other LPS sets that I actually coveted and won on ebay; in my bidding fervor, I didn't even notice this above set included in the lot- if I had, I would have had a crucifix readied at my front door. Certainly works well...you can hear the cat ""slurping"" from the bottle rooms away. Cat is placed on metal rod on heavy, battery-operated basket, magnetic bottle is placed to cat's pie-hole, and the result...well, let's just say that I am reminded of the guy that Rizzo takes to the school dance instead of Kenickie in the movie ""Grease""."
1,Español de España,"Este libro no fue muy útil para nosotros porque fue impreso en España y es difícil de entender para un niño latinoamericano. Además, aparte de esto, el vocabulario en general es muy avanzado para niños. Sí, las ilustraciones son muy lindos, pero sólo hay una o dos para cada cuento. Muchas palabras, pocas ilustraciones.This book is written in Spain-Spanish, rather than in Latin-American-Spanish. There is a big difference, and for that reason Latinamerican chilren will have a hard time understanding or following this book. In addition, the vocabulary in general is very advanced and the stories are not written in an engaging fashion for children. There are beautiful illustrations, but not enough for each story. One or two illustrations per story is not enough considering how many words are on each page."
5,Top-notch entertainment / Beautiful photography!,"Frankly, I thought this movie might be a bit slow and boring, but I and my family really enjoyed it. A lot more realistic about dolphins than, say, ""Flipper"". I highly recommend ""Eye of the Dolphin"" for any age movie watcher!"
4,Pleasantly surprised,"I was glad to see a lot of positive reviews on this website. This film truly deserves some good ratings. It's a fun, well done family film. I'll admit some of the acting isn't world class but Carly Schroeder is a fresh new talent and enjoyable to watch.As for any comments that this film is not ""family friendly,"" the drug use is brief and condemned and condemned. As for the condom: God forbid a film promotes safe sex to teens. Anyone who doesn't think 14 year olds know about sex is just fooling themselves."
4,Great,"I really, really liked this movie. I loved that it was filmed in the Bahamas and had dolphins in it and the way Hawk and Alyssa grew closer and closer to having a father/daughter relationship. The only thing I didn't like is that Alyssa was always surrounded by people older than her. There wasn't a single kid with a big part in the movie besides Alyssa. Maybe if she had met a few girls (or boys... hehe), I'd have rated this 5 stars instead of 4.Good movie overall, though."
5,Communication and Relationships,"I saw this film at the theater with my wife and 14 year old son. And although the movie is targeted at young teen girls, it is enjoyable for both boys and girls. This is the story of a troubled teen girl by the name of Alyssa. And to be brief, when things get out of hand for her, she is sent to the Bahamas to live with the father she thought was dead and never knew she had. And to not give too much away, Alyssa finally learns to think about and communicate with others, shomething we should all learn. When I saw it, there were those who thought it too long, others too short as the plot took time to develep and expand on each character. This to me means it was the correct length. This is truly a diamond in the rough as it is better than all the reviews I have read."
3,Good for Pro !,"This is a book for the IT professionals with good knowledge in Shell Scripting. It does not provide enough explanation about the Shell scripting to help beginners. The book is just for the BASH scripting, and the author's approach is not systematic. Therfore, this book is not good to use for the educational purpose.I recommend this book to those who know the Shell Scripting, but they are looking for some new ideas or second opinion."
3,A minor clarification from one of the authors,"It's rather hard to ""shell script Windows"" without some form of third party add-on. The base Windows command line, as it currently stands, is ill-suited to anything but the most basic of commands, and kicking off WMI scripts, whereas pretty much any Unix system comes standard with a full suite of scripting tools and shells.This should be changing with Monad in Windows Vista, but for right now, shell scripting in Windows without third party tools is just not going to compare to what you can do with Unix."
4,Great stuff,"This is an old book, but stats don't change a whole lot, so it still works. I always find multiple perspectives on something insightful. This book covers a lot of material, including stuff that isn't generally included in early level behavioral stats. The language is easy to read, and the material is presented concisely. There are examples and clear instructions clear reasoning for each stat covered. Good help.Could do with more examples or exercises."
5,Yeah!,I can not find this cany anywhere except for a city miles away. Although this is my favorite candy of all time I dont really think its worth the gas. I was so excited that I found them here. I love that they come individually wrapped too. They usally come in a pack of 6 but this is so much better because I can control myself a lot more when I feel like I dont have to eat the whole pack because I will! Its like a potato chip!
2,Goldenberg Peanut Chews-Not the Same,"Notwithstanding the manufacturer's web site, I was unable find these in any local store. My order from Amazon arrived with the candy fresh and in good shape. But as other reviewers noted the recipe must have been changed. The chewy part tended too be more like cardboard than caramel. The peanuts did not have a fresh taste either. This candy used to melt to a smooth, textured treat in the mouth. Now it leaves a dry, papery feel. The chocolate remains very good. Since I can only have one a day, I was overall disappointed."
5,very happy,I like this seller I ordered the next thing I know my packagehas arrived. I am going to order from him again.
5,The BEST candy ever!,"This candy is so hard to find, but delicious! I wish it could be mass marketed so it was more accessible."
4,Good and Chewy,"I actually bought these for my wife, as these are her favorite candies. After tasting them myself, I found the taste is a good mix of dark chocolate and peanutty flavor. The only negative I find with these are that they are a bit on the tough side to chew."
3,NOT THE SAME,I REMEMBER THE GOLDENBERG PEANUT CHEWS FROM MY YOUTH AND THEY WERE DELICIOUS AND NUTTY. NOW WHERE ARE THE PEANUTS? THE TASTE IS SIMILAR BUT THE TEXTURE OF THE CANDY IS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.
5,Reminds me of Home,"I am originally from the Philly area but moved to Texas 7 yrs ago and if I miss anything about PA - its the food! (Come on, cheese steaks, pretzels, ring bolonga, birch beer, tastykakes and peanut chews...you'd miss it too). I share these a few Philly transplants I met here in Texas. Thanks for providing us with a great product at a great price and for letting us all re-live a little bit of our childhood!"
5,Read Max. Warp Book 1 then dive in to this awesome sequel!,"This two book saga is true to Star Trek: TNG. Action, intrigue, and class all cleverly squeezed into print! The first book catches hold of you and leaves you hungry for more. This book does an excellent job in keeping you in suspense. Who are the good guys? What will happen next? How in the hell is Picard going to save the Universe this time? Read it and find out. This book brings in a completely fresh edge to the universe once again being saved by a captain of the Enterprise (with the help of his crew and a few people you wouldn't expect!) I won't tell. You gotta read it! Long live Star Trek: TNG! :)"
2,Don't waste your money on this guide,"Just returned from a trip to Rome with two kids and had this book in hand. Most of the ideas listed are things that most people would come up with on their own and some of the things listed were just wrong...for example, we showed up at the Victor Emmanuel monument early to see the big iron gate descend (as noted in the book) and not only was the opening time wrong but it turns out that all they do is open a door in the gate. They also list (in a note) a museum dedicated to nativity sets...turns out it's only open in the evenings, a fact that the authors fail to mention."
3,fodor's around rome with kids,"We used this guide during our trip to Rome this summer with our 14/11/9/and 7 year olds. There are some inaccuracies with opening and closing times of a few churches and museums that needs updating. A map highlighting the attractions is missing, and would be very desirable.The book did highlight a few interesting facts that were missing in the traditional guides.I would recommend using this book as an adjunct......but you could probably get by without it."
3,Useful Info But Not Particularly Appealing for Kids,"She has the right idea, linking monuments and museums to people and events that should be of interest to kids. She also lists nearby restaurants and ice cream shops for refreshments. Our kids just weren't very interested in museums and churches. We made it into one each during our trip.The organizaton of the book, counting down from 68, didn't make much sense. Is #68 the most interesting or #1? The red type is hard on the eyes. The little ""Hey Kids"" call outs indicated that this is really a book for adults to use to guide their kids."
5,Makes you cry... And squeal with joy.,"This soundtrack is perfect. Perfect. Perfect for the ancient Volvo-driving high school/college crowd who saw the movie and loved it. You know what? You probably have all the songs anyway, but you still need the album, because the way they're assembled is perfect-- for taking your rusting Geo Metro for a drive in the country with your new flame."
1,adrenal test,All the things were in box but the directions did not make it clear how many tubes I needed to fill for my test.
1,Read the reviews and save your money.,"It's OK as far as it goes, but it IS after all, only one person's account of her experience. Otherwise, having been given a mildly borderline diagnosis ""possible Graves"", I quickly figured out that going on the internet would probably give me more information from which to make my own decisions about what is, after all, my (as opposed to the medical industry) body. If you do feel the need to buy this book, do so. Otherwise, read the reviews, go on the internet, and save your money."
3,Not so Great,"I purchased this battery pack assuming it would yield me more shooting time on my nikon 5700. However,my experience has bee less than satisfying with this accesory . I find the original lithium battery that came with the camera lasts longer than a set of six (expensive) alkaline batteries attached via the MB-E5700 and forget about the rechargable batteries, they last even less. I believe it would be more cost efficient to purchase two extra lithium bateries and have them available when shooting for extended periods. Another minus is that the battery pack adds more weight to the camera and makes it more bulky. I would think twice when purchasing this item. In my opinion it really isn't necesary."
1,"Item listed as ""in stock"" was not really in stock","I went to make a purchase on a used Nikon battery pack (which was discounted to 30% cost) which was listed as ""in-stock"" and they cancelled my order saying the item was not ""in-stock"". I think vendors should have an obligation to keep that information up to date. Now I'll be paying full-price plus a rush fee so I can use the battery pack at a planned event."
3,Important Option,"I have not bought this item yet, but seeing that it is available puts the 5700 back into consideration for my next digital camera. After paying outrageous prices for various proprietary battery packs, I finally decided if it doesn't use AA NiMh batteries I don't want it. These batteries have excellent capacity and only cost about 3x what alkalines cost - and they don't have the problems that NiCds have. I can buy a ton of spares and use them in almost any device I have. Thankyou Nikon, yours looked like a nice camera but I had ruled it out because of the batteries. It is now at the top of my list."
2,not impressed,"Good ideas but too much teacher prep. involved. I wanted something ready to use. I've used Great Glyphs Around the Year and it's much better (reproducibles, ready to use). I'm sending this one back."
3,Okay buy,"Goop product overall. Steaks come out of ground. Ball gets stuck in net. Not wide enough. Its easy to set up, bring down, and put away."
3,"OK, but could be better choices out there","I should have done more research and checked reviews first. I was excited to get a net right away to help my 8 year old son with hitting, so I ran out and bought this on sale. I've had this net for about a year, moderate use by my son, but I occasionally hit off of a tee into it, too. It's nice and big, and catches the baseballs well. Set up is easy, but folding it up is a hassle. The instructions were not good. We'd probably use it more if take down wasn't such a chore. I think I twisted the frame's base while trying to fold it up, and now it won't rest flat on the ground, leans and falls over without the ground stakes. My own fault, yes, but if it had better instructions and folding was easier it might not have been an issue.Now I'm considering the Jugs Instant Screen (also pop up) or the Bow Net, to avoid pop-up altogether."
1,Broke after first day,When I got this for Christmas I was really excited. After setting it up to see what it looked like and tested it out. After testing we (my dad and I) folded it up as per the instructions and placed in the bag. The next day I took out to set it my garage and the frame was bent. After hours of trying to get the frame straight again I realized it was broken. I returned to store and am going to buy a different brand. DONT GET THIS NET!!!!!!
3,OK for recreational use.,"This net is OK for recreational use, but isn't as good as the Typhoon Net or Hurricane Net. The net is not very sturdy and is difficult to use in windy conditions. Also, the telescoping poles can bend easily and become damaged."
2,Difficult to fold up versus Others,"Unfortunately Easton has 'struck out' on this net. I used it for 3 seasons and it just wouldn't fold up correctly after about the 4th time. the wieght of the net and poles along with the cumbersome/awkward setup makes this net a failure from day one. As a coach I would advise against this net. I got it on a deal for 69.99 but it wasn't worth the many headaches I experienced. Also, if my son would soft toss to me it would barely hold up to my swings and I by all counts am a doubles hitter not a homerun hitter. Save yourself the headache and look elsewhere for your portable batting needs. There is a reason this product gets so many 3 star or less ratings."
4,Is really pretty big,"The net is pretty big, this combined with the ""pop up"" nature of the product makes it impossible for my son to set up/take down on his own. Makes it even a little hard for mom and dad getting the twists/folds just right to get it back in the carrying bag. It's holding up ok for as much as we do use it."
1,Not good,"doesn't stand up any kind of wind, I got mine two monthes ago and now it is twisted and not in the original shape.I wish I could return it."
1,Just too darn hard to set up and take down,"I am an engineer, and a fairly mechanical person. This net is just too hard to get set up and take down. I returned it after the first two times I tried. They should revert to the style that they use for outside tents. I had an Adidas net, but after three years it broke, and I cannot find it to replace anywhere."
3,OK -- Could be better,"I bought this net for my kids in Little League baseball. I have found that (a) it folds up easy if you have folded 'pop-up' type items before (tents, etc.) and (b) it is unstable in even a slight wind and works better if it is on a slight backward incline. The balls we hit into it stayed inside as the net is pretty floppy. The pole supports could benefit from a sturdier design.Generally, this is fine for younger kids if you are looking for something inexpensive and portable. As my kids get older I imagine we'll transition to the heavier gauge pole nets that they have out at our ballpark."
2,Cant handle the wind,"This is a decent net, easy to pack and unpack, but its completely useless if there is any wind blowing. How often is there NO wind! I have tried to use this net for practices and pre-game warmup, but its just too big of a hassle if there is the slightly bit of wind.I would recommend this product only if you intend to use it indoors."
1,poorly constructed / lousy customer service,"I own this net and it stinks! Actually it's okay when you first get it but then the poles have these little washers that fall out making the thing useless. This not just that I happened to get one bad net. It's happened to everyone I know that has purchased this net. Friends, other coaches, even my daughter's high school softball team had bought this product and it didn't last a season. As an added bonus when you call customer service they say the parts are unavailable, as in they don't sell replacement pieces. You're on your own.My advice .... BUY THE JUGS NET! It has no poles and is easy to work with. At first I though it would be difficult to deal with but after looking at the instructions(duh) it's actually quite simple to open and fold up."
4,handy brush,"This brush helps me reach the lower part of my van without having to kneel or over flex my back. However, the surface should be hosed down to remove/loosen the dirt as the brush is too soft to scrub effectively on it's own."
3,Just okay,The brush is extremely handy. The bristles need to be a little stronger to clean the dirtier parts of the car. I do not use the buit in soap container so I do not know how well that works.
4,Great but short,"A very entertaining book! 12 very obscure (to most) stories of Arthur and his knights. Written in modern prose, but not completely omitting the flavor of middle ages romances, this is a collection of stories that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. These aren't the stories in Mallory or other famous retellers. Chances are, if you're not an Arthurian researcher, you won't have even heard of half the stories within. This book has wide appeal...especially if you'd like an insight into what tales entertained the people of olden days. Some are dark and cold, some are heroic and rousing. The best part is that all stories are sourced - if you wish to read more, or in the original text's format, the author points you in the right direction. Definately, this book is worth the price."
3,Stylish and well built but inconvenient,"I love the look of the watch, it's easy to adjust and wear, and it's very durable. The biggest problem I have with it, as that you can't just turn your wrist and see the time and date. The display is dark and obscured, so you have to hit the light-up button to get a decent view. Maybe I just got a bad one or something, but it does seem to be a problem inherent both to the design of having the display so deeply recessed, and the inverted LCD.So, fashion-wise? Excellent.Function-wise? Meh."
3,"Everything OK, exept the packing.","Hey if you're thinking on buy this item, think 'et twicw, is a good toy ans almost everything is OK, But one Mayor issue, comes without ANY wrapping, and since 99.9% of this purchased are gone to be a present, Is not the best presentation of the gift. And at list if it said so on the add, but nothing. PLEASE TAKE NOTICE OF THIS HUGE ISSUE.If you're not thinking on send'em as a gift, its OK, but other way think it twice."
1,too wordy for little kids,"I know it is meant for relaxation, and it was definately boring enough to want to put it down and go right to sleep. However, the story was too wordy and the vocabulary very advanced for anyone in the 5-8 year range."
5,Easier Bed times!!,"My youngest daughter age 6 has Sensory Processing Intergration, along with Anxiety. Her Anxiety can keep her from doing things she really wants to. Going to bed has always been an issue in our home. She becomes very aggitated and anxious at bedtime. I bought the book ""The Goodnight Catapillar"" and it has helped alot. She has learned to relax her body in bed as the Catapillar does in the book. The pictures are beautiful and she actually catches things I as her mother don't such as in each page as the catapillar relaxes his hands become straight and relaxed. I would reccomend this book to anyone whose child has a hard time going to bed at night!"
4,Five year old helped!,"I bought this book for my five year old son, who has anxiety disorder. He was having difficulty sleeping at night, due to anxiety about the next days' events (school, soccer, etc). We read this book together each night and he says he can feel himself relaxing, ""just like the caterpillar in the book, mom!"" He's sleeping really well most nights and his teacher says he uses the deep breathing techniques at school when things seem overwhelming for him.The story line is pretty basic and if you can pair this with actually growing caterpillars, the book really comes to life. It's age appropriate, too, with something for kids of all ages. I even relax while I read it!"
5,Real Relaxation Tools for Kids,I love this author I have almost all her books and cds I gave all the kids in my family her books and cds this year my niece cant wait to get home from school to listen to her cds and all the parents were thrilled to actually have a fun way to help their kids learn about relaxation.
5,A Wonderful Gift for your Child,"This is a wonderful book that my 4 year old daughter truly loves and understands. Lori Lite has a series of insightful books for children which are wonderful tools to help children relax and honor themselves. It's such a treat to see your child at peace and sharing relaxation techniques with other children. I highly recommend it!In Joy, Susan L. Mike, MD, Co-Founder of Joyful Genius, Where Moms Start Smart!"
1,Bootleg!,This is not even close to the real thing. The colors are way off and the picture itself is completely wrong.
5,When real life is more unthinkable than your worse nightmare,"For an entire family to endure oppression and sexual abuse by a father - the protector - is unthinkable. Though, as Donald D'Haene sets out early in his book, ""Fathers Touch"", it does happen and unfortunately, probably more often than we know.Danald's life story is not only of physical and sexual abuse, but also of religious oppression. It's quite obvious Donald's and his siblings abuse could have stopped, years earlier, if it were not for the secret system of the Jehovah's Witnesses.""Father's Touch"" will keep you wanting to know what's around the corner on the next page.Thank you Donald for sharing with us your pain and your survival.Bryan Lee McGlothin"
5,Amazing Read!!!,"As a survivor myself I have read many books by fellow survivors and other experts in the field of sexual abuse. Donald's rendition of his story however, is the most moving and thought provoking one that I have read. The clash of culture between religion and law and the frank disclosure of how even those perceived to be the best among us, simply refuse to get involved with difficult situations, should move and challenge everyone to examine our personal perceptions and make sure we are seeing the world as it is, rather than as we want it to be."
5,"Timely, informative and original!","This might be a shocking story to some, but one that needs to be told. Father's Touch proves that childhood sexual abuse is not gender specific, but is a crime of violence, power and manipulation. D'Haene is courageous. Imagine the guts it took to write this story!A young boy is no more able to defend himself against a perpertrator than a young female. This story shows we must watch over our children no matter what their gender.Well written and unforgetable."
5,Father's Touch a real eyeopener on pedophilia and child abuse,"I am happy this book was written, it exposes those that should have helped this situation and didn't. The Jehovah's Witness religion actually protects molesters and lets the children suffer the consequences. the writer generates sympathy by telling the truth . And it is so sad that others like therapists, doctors the police all failed the children who asked for help. I was very moved by their plight and it has made me aware and taught me to look for signs of problems in other families and children"
5,Its not all doom and gloom,"Reading this book,I found it to be the type that makes you want to keep reading and not want to put it down.Partly because the I could not beleive what I was reading,the horror, what the family was going through and what this man was doing to them.The book has its lighter side to it ( hard to beleive with this type of subject) So its not all doom and gloom.When you know what the book is about you may think oh I have heard all this before. you have to remeber this is a book about a survivor and the fact that he did do something about it and not dwell on sympathy.I hope this book can help others who are in the same situation and do something about it."
1,not what one would expect,WAY too graphic so that the abuse is portrayed sexually from the child's viewpoint in my opinion... didn't get the impact that needs to be shown from the eye of the helpless child who is tormeted.
5,unusual renderings of prototype specimens,"As one of the illustrators (Marita), I would like to point out that I produced many of these illustrations from black and white photographs of perfectly shaped shells which were then colored according to the colors and patterns on recently acquired shells...the illustrations therefore are quite special in that they are the prototypes for their classification."
3,Book Purchase,"Got my product in a timely manner. The book was cheap though, so it was not looking very good..."
2,"Don't bother, start out with the MRF-300","I install audio/video equipment for a living and my suggestion is just to buy the MRF-300 or MRF-350 to start with. There are just too many interference problems inside an audio cabinet for the MRF-250 to work well in most applications. Cable boxes, dvrs, tivos, blueray DVDs and any product with a microprocessor or harddrive is likely to cause interference that will render the MRF-250 useless.Both the MRF-300 and the MRF-350 have separate antenna modules that allow you to mount the receiving module in an area not prone to interference. There is just not enough difference in the cost to warrant having to deal with the potential problems of the MRF-250.TNichols"
4,Good ol' poems from yesteryear,"This is a delightful old book from the Nineteen Thirties, with an introduction by Booth Tarkington and replete with many line drawing illustrations, and not a few color plates by an artist named Willy Pogany. As Tarkington noted, they are not only some of children's favorites and parents' favorites, but also some poems which should be favorites but probably are not on very many people's lists."
3,not as good as the movie,I had waited so anxiously to get this book as i loved the movie the story had me spellbound but the book actually pales in comparison
5,Satirical Slap in the Face,"Ouch!! Once I got his literary device, his satirical critique hit home with both humorous and distressing poignancy! The sad truth is that many leaders in desperate need of updating of their methods and models will fall victim to a wholesale exchange of contemporary style for contextual substance. Russell Rathbun's critique of ultra-modern Christianity is a must read poking fun at our attempts to contemporize ministry without the accompanying and necessary spiritual depth, character, and authentic (and ancient) substance of the gospel. Ouch, ouch, ouch!!!"
1,This is only half the text of the book!,"Incredibly, this book ends midway through the story. Somebody was obviously not paying attention. It appears to be photocopied from a collection of Sir Walter Scott's works and the volume must have ended in the middle of the story, to be continued in the next volume. Somehow, they neglected to notice this. If you wish to read the entire enthralling tale, get a used book from years past."
3,nice,"It is not bad, but the music overpowers the sounds of the dophins. I was hoping for more the soundsof dophins to calm my Adhd godson."
4,This will be of some help,It will be a big help on some projects that require fast writtingand being able to understand what was written.
1,Kindle version is not the Kaufman translation,"Even though it is described as the Kaufman translation, the Kindle version seems to be the earlier translation that is described above as problematic. While it would be interesting to compare the differences between the two, I think I'd rather start with the newer translation."
5,It's pure music,"Not only the book content is revolutionary, but the form. This book is a magnificent exemple of how Buber, through words, transcended them. He managed to put us face-to-face with universal pulsations of life and love. And you dont have to be an ""intelectual"" to be transformed by this living book, but the opposite. Just read Buber. Or better: listen to him and talk to him. It's pure music ( a message to the reader from Cambridge, MA : Mozart also wrote ""too many notes..."")."
5,Old Friend,"Mr. Buber and I met in my comparative religion class in 1965. I couldn't grasp his concepts at the time, but intuitively knew I believed his thesis. Now we meet again, and I'm astonished at how compatible we are. Writing is superb of course, that is, the translation, and his premise totally describes our predicament as bonded to ""it"" and not to ""thou."" It's worth reading, but probably for over 25-year olds!"
5,recommended edition trans. by the able Kaufmann,This book should destroy any psychological notion that people exist in separate subjectivities. Buber's beautifully written psycho-mystical prose leaves one breathless. A deserved classic.
5,"The one who likes Bubers writings, will be delighted","I AND THOU by Martin BuberI think this book will delight everyone who likes Buber,or who appreciates sentences like""Of course God is the wholly Other""; but He is also the wholly Same, the wholly Present.""I love that book and bought it from amazon one month ago - after I had heard people talk of itfor ages..."
1,That is quite a book...,"I don't know if I've ever seen (much less attempted to read) anything that obscure. I'm not sure this book isn't a hoax. Compared to it the proceedings of the 26 Congress of CPSU were a straight-forward, tight and logical document <g>. Good luck reading..."
5,Eye-opening work of great spiritual power,You don't have to be Jewish or even to have studied Judaic theology to appreciate Buber's genius. This book is about forming a relationship with God but has applications to everday ones as well. Fantastic!
2,Dont buy it.,"get it from interlibrary loan instead. I love Abbey's non-fiction writing but this book would have benefited greatly from a harsh editor that had the guts to say, simply, NO! No, we will not publish this inane collection of lame quips and quotes Mr Abbey, because it does not deserve to sit on the same shelf or even in the same room as your other work.Do you know all those great ideas and one-liners that come to you late at night that seem so witty and smart and true, but just dont hold up under the harsh light of the next day? This book is full of those. Argghh, ED, my freakin eyes hurt! :)"
5,Perfect!,"Was looking for a nice bookcase for my 4 year old daughter's room. I wanted it to hold a good amount of books, be sturdy, and not take up a lot of space. This is perfect! Nice piece for the price. And its not a boring white box. So happy with this purchase. We put all her books in it and still have room. When she walked in her room and seen it with her books she was so excited. She said, ""Surprise, Ava's library."" She jumped up and down for a while. I didn't expect her to get so excited for a book shelf. It can work as a nightstand but a bit taller than a nightstand. But we put her Shrek alarm clock radio on top of it."
4,Nice shelf - easy to assemble,"This shelf was very easy to put together and is a good value. It is definitely not a in the same league as a pottery barn kids shelf, but for the price, it was a great solution for us for our baby's room to store larger books and a basket of toys."
4,Great little bookcase!,Got this for our nursery...pleased with everything. Easy set up. Perfect size. V. happy for what we got for the price.
3,light construction feel,i was expecting something a little more substantial and of thicker gauge construction. this piece of furniture feels disposable and of low quality materials. needless to say it looks nice. not sure it was worth $70.
4,Solid bookshelf,Was easy to put together and looks good. Does not look flimsy or cheep and fits nicely with other semi gloss white furniture.
4,Cute Bookcase,"I bought this bookcase to put in our nursery for our new baby boy. I searched the web high and low and realized this was the best option. I like the wanscotting, because it adds a nice touch without being too overpowering, and it is the perfect size for a small nursery. It was not too hard to put together once I got the hang of it, and it also seems pretty sturdy for put together furniture. Overall not a bad choice for the price."
5,Can't beat it for the price,"I bought this to put in my toddler's room. It is stark white, and her cottage furniture is off-white so I plan on painting it to match. But for $50 you can't find a better deal. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't have intricate molding details but the wainscoting does add a punch that most other $50 dollar bookcases don't have. I also put 2 small pink wicker baskets from Land of Nod on the bottom shelf and they fit perfectly. Good size for little ones."
5,Great child bookshelf,"Have had this bookshelf for almost two years now. It was easy to assemble and has held up very well. Searched a lot of places and this one had the best measurements for our room and storing those large board books. Plus, can use it as a nightstand. Not sure what's out there these days, but would highly recommend this one. I want to get another for my 2nd son now."
1,Poor Quality,"This was the poorest quality of furniture we have purchased in a long time. It arrived with the front board cracked - we were so desperate to have a bookcase with these small dimensions, we were wiling to accept this, but then some of the holes weren't drilled correctly so the shelf was not straight. Overall, this was a big disappointment. This was the first time we have ever returned a furniture item."
5,Very Nice,"We bought this for our daughter's nursery and I am very happy with it. It took a little getting used to to assemble, but once we got the hang of it, it was very easy. I like that the back panels side in and are not nailed to the back. They will not pop off over time. It's a nice size and sturdy. We are purchasing a second one because we have too many books."
5,Fabulous little bookcase!,"We were looking for a small bookcase for our toddler's bedroom. It arrived in great shape, with all of its bits in place. I put it together in less than 20 minutes and it was a breeze. The case stands to about her shoulder height and it's just about as wide as a little night stand. We are ordering a second one for the other side of her bed, for symmetry and more organization (she has decided to house her stuffed animals as well). I would recommend this to anyone concerned with tidying up a bit with a small, sturdy piece that does not tip over. It came with a wall mount, for extra safety, but honestly the case is perfectly level and does not move."
4,worth the money,"Easy Assembly. Sturdy. We put colorful boxes on the shelves and put toys in them in my son's room. I probably would have paid a little more for it, too. It doesn't look junky... probably do to the decorative front."
4,A good sequel to an interesting story. . .,"In ""A God against the gods"" the late Allen Drury introduced us to 18th Dynasty Egypt, and some of the colorful personalities which debated the concept of monotheism for (possibly) the first time in history. Now, in ""Return to Thebes"", Mr. Drury finishes the story. We see the madness and decline of the Pharaoh, and the machinations of the priests of the traditional gods to regain their former power.Altogether, a fascinating look at a period of history which was (until this point) totally unfamiliar for me.I highly recommend these books."
3,Very strange,"I liked this movie, but there were alot of loop holes in it's logic and the end was horrible. One loop hole is 2 caracters are riding in a car, and one begins shooting flames all over the place. Neither gets even scorched. But by the end of the movie, the one character is burnt pretty bad.On the other hand, the movie takes a creepy surreality at times that if it had maintained, this wold have been a classic. Example is at one point 2 characters are discussing the situation, and in the middle of the conversation voices from the radio add clues to the mystery. The 1950's Area 51 atmosphere is a plus.The ending makes no real sence.I do like ths movie, and love parts, but over all, the end was crap."
1,PONTIAC GRAND AM RIGHT DOOR MAUNUAL MIRROR,THE COMPANY HAD SENT ME THE WRONG MIRROR I HAD TRIED TRIED TRIED TRIED CONTACTING THE COMPANY EVEN LEFT MESSAGES AND E-MAILS EVEN CALLED AMAZON THEY SAID COULD TAKE UP 2 14 DAYS BEFORE A REFUND OR REPLACEMENT I HAVE ELECTRIC MIRRORS NOT MANUAL I GAVE THIS COMPANY EVERY OPPORTUNITY 2 TRY AND SETTLE THIS LIKE THEY WERE REAL PROFESSIONALS BE4 I CONTACTED AMAZON WELL THEY FAILED I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN AND IF AMAZON DON'T TAKE CARE OF THIS 2 I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH SITE PERIOD I USUALLY DO CONDUCT MY BUSINESS WITH E-BAY BUT E-BAY DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I NEEDED SO SELLER I WOULD LIKE U 2 C IF UR STILL GOING 2 HANDLE THIS LIKE PROFESSIONALS CUZ MY NEXT STEP IS 2 TURN U IN2 THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU SO I'LL KEEP ON CONTACTING THE COMPANY TIL THEY GET TIRED OF IT
5,u serious?,"This by far the best album I have copped this year. My eyes and ears are always open for new innovative projects and while this album doesn't really transcend the r&b, jazz-infused recipe that other artists have touched upon over the years, I must say that Jazzy Jeff EXCELS at producing it. ""for the love of the game"" must be one of the most refreshing tracks hip hop has had to offer during the last couple years, and the supporting cast that Jazz invites into this production masterpiece do not fall short (ok, that boyz to men cat could have been dropped)of my highest expectations. Also Freddie Fox comes correct with a rather more chilled out yet authoritative flow that I never knew he had, and I have been listening to him for a long time. If you love the best beats of producers like hi-tech, and jaydee, then this is a must buy. It will be heavy in your rotation."
5,Best album of 2002 so far.,"DJ Jazzy Jeff's latest Beat Generation installment ""The Magnificent"" emits a breath of life to a currently stagnant hip-hop culture. This album is constructed and orchestrated by Jazzy Jeff and a number of other A Touch Of Jazz producers. This album sets a tranquil, jazzy, soulful, mood in a typical b-boy fashion. This album directly captures the listener. ""The Magnificent"" immediately causes the listener to become interwoven with essence of the streets of Philly through a beautiful soundscape. A majority of the guests featured are all underground local artists who deserve more recognition. Standouts on the album include ""For the Love of Da Game"", ""Scram"" and ""Know Your Hood"". This album is a pure gem and the more you listen to it the more addictive it becomes. If you're a hip-hop, soul, or jazz aficionado, I suggest you cop this one while you still can."
2,"decent art, not so decent story","The art for this is rather nice, though a little off at some times, and the chibi-blank Fujiwara is kinda creepy.All in all, the author does a decent job of establishing a ""world"" - the characters enjoyably interact with each other although they are admittedly a bit of cliche character types - I'm thinking of a combo of Alec (Ceres) and Watari (Yami no Matsuei) for the doctor, and Kiri (Beauty Pop) and some others for Fujiwara.The main problem with this book is that from page one you feel as if you are thrown into an already existing world without any initiation - as if this was a spinoff from some other series (Brand-New Angels?) Not only does the manga-ka seem to assume we know as much about her world as she, but she then follows up with a shaky storyline.The bottom line is, if you want to buy this book, read at least a chapter or two first to make sure."
2,Save your manga-bucks - pass on this one,"It has some nicely drawn characters and decent background art. The character's themselves aren't too bad either. There are some nice quirky moments of humor but they are separated by lots of who-cares storyline. As a matter of fact I've seen cereal boxes with more plot than this manga. It might pick up in vol. #2 but I'm not holding my breath. It's as if the creator sat down and decided to write a little gender-bender school story, but then decided they'd like it to have a supernatural twist so the main character is given the power to control water. Not bad so far, but then the creator struggles mightily to come up with storylines that could include this power at a high school. It's really sorry stuff so far. I would like to see this creator paired up with a real writer and save his/her focus on the sequential artwork, which is where this creator excels."
1,A TOY not a purse,"This purse and watch is made of inferior, cheap material. The scarf is so short it can barely fit around the neck. This must have been designed for a child as this purse is not big enough to hold a pair of glasses. I regretted ever buying this."
4,lefty grove: American original,"Finally, an informative biography of the greatest pitcher of all-time. For the most part the bio is well written and covers the breadth of the long career and life of the greatest southpaw whoever pitched. There are a few grammatical mistakes that take away from the flow of the book, but overall it's clean. Definately well researched. The author interviewed former teammates, his family, and former friends from his hometown in Maryland. This is the only book I've ever seen on Lefty and I would recommend this book if your interested in learning about this tempermental baseball star."
4,I Recommend the Book,"I enjoyed this book thoroughly. It fills in the gaps that most baseball fans have regarding Lefty Grove, whom most confuse with Lefty Gomez. That's a shame becasue Lefty Grove is arguably one of -if not the - best pitchers in baseball history. Some has stated that his personality was rather dull and that explains why he is often overlooked. After reading this book, I'd characterize his personality as more eccentric than dull....And what a great pitcher! Read this book - you won't regret it."
2,"Great pitcher, dull character","The text is not bad but something is really missing. I think the plain fact is despite Lefty Grove's greatness, he was a dull uninteresting guy himself. He's not even loathsome and looney like Ty Cobb to make for a ""the glory meets the train wreck of a life"" read. As far as pitchers of his era, check out ""Walter Johnson: The Big Train"" by Henry Thomas which is a far better book. Although ""Lefty Grove: American Original"" is an extremely well researched book giving it a good feel for the times, a better bet is probably to check out the books on manager Connie Mack and his A's of the '20s."
4,GOOD BOOK ABOUT GREAT PITCHER,LEFTY GROVE AMERICAN ORIGINAL IS WORTH READING. I ENJOYED THE TELLING OF HIS CAREER AND LIFE. HE WAS PHENOMINAL TALENT WITH A HOT TEMPER TO GO WITH IT. THIS NOVEL IS WELL WRITTEN AND KEPT MY INTEREST ALL THE WAY. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS BASEBALL HISTORY AND THE GREAT MEN WHO PLAYED IT.
4,A must read for family therapists and counselors!,This book is a must read for family therapists. Most therapists marginalize the experience of homosexuals in their practice. This book gives them the opportunity to learn how to treat these clients equitably
2,Very disorganized,"While this book covers information that is of interest to TCM practitioners and lay people alike, it does so in a disorganized manner. One would think that a book on pulse diagnosis might start with describing the attributes of a pulse. Defining the terms used to describe the pulse would be a good place to start. Perhaps then one could go into how to take a pulse and what to look for. Unfortunately this book violates all standard pedagogical principles. Terms are used before they are defined. Circular definitions are used and information is presented in a redundant manner. While the information is interesting, the book should have been written in a much clearer fashion."
5,Impressed,"Well, what more can I say. I teach English in Mexico and bought this book here. It's a bit more expensive here, but it was well worth the wait. In addition to the book, I bought the workbook, the teacher's manual and the cassettes. The level of the book itself is about 4th to 7th grade. It is a very impressive book and intend on buying the newest series, when or if they become available. I would recommend this series to anyone who would be interested in teaching ESL or EFL."
3,Bird Songs at Eventide,"Music is very well done but content could be improved. Needs some more old beloved songs such as ""Red Wing,"" ""Listen to the Mocking Bird,"" ""My Grandfather's Clock.:"""
4,Very Good Summary of the Herman Goering Division,Very good brief history of the Herman Goering division with the usual excellent art work of the different uniforms used by the division. A must read for those interested in the history of the division and it's zones of deployment. Excellent for the modeller keen on recreating authentic uniforms for figure painting.
1,Very disappointing,"This book has been very much a disappointment for me. When a book is titled the ""..... division"" I expect a detailed description of the movement of the division, its equipments and its engagements. Instead, with this book all you get is the most general descrition of the division but plenty on soldiers in uniforms and their insignia. A general book on WWII gives me almost the same information on this divison. And there are only pictures of soldiers off duty, basically nothing on tanks and other equipment. They should not have called this book the ""Hermann Goering Division"". A far more appropriate title would have been ""Uniforms of the troops of the Hermann Goering division"" because that is all you will get."
1,Pages missing,"I would have liked to know there were pages missing, because I would have bought it somewhere else."
2,Tedius,"While the actual book has a lot of good information, the workbook itself is mindless and silly. I don't learn anything from filling it out. It brings me back to junior high school."
2,Very sad,"im disipointed in this Cd. although some people like ur new fast songs i for one disagree with this change ... u should stick to the original slow songs ... like ""Its over Now"".... keep the old 112 spirit alive :)"
2,what happened??,"Geez 112 used to be my favourite rnb group. They were the ones who brought me into liking rnb. But since Part III they have been going down. Now they left badboy it's even worse. What happened? All the beats in this album is wacked, not much originality, and mostly, they aren't being themselves. I think that they are trying to become too commercial. THis is crap don't even think of getting it."
1,What happened?,"I've been a 112 fan before it was cool to be a fan. I'm talking all the way back to 1995 with the first song on the Money Train soundtrack. I bought this album and am really really disappointed. The previous albums, ""112"", ""Room 112"", and ""Part III"" are far superior to this lackluster effort. This is a-typical R&B album and as a long time fan I simply expected better than this.""Na, Na,..."" is bad. Hot & Wet is alright but again, it sounds like everything else that is out there.Try again, fellas."
4,Four Stars for 112's Fourth Album!!!,"I have been a 112 fan since the release of their debut album back in 1996. I instantly fell in love with the soulful voices of Q, Mike, Slim, and Daron*(my personal favorite). So naturally I bought their next two albums. Then came the label change and also a change in 112. Now this album is not bad at all, its just that it has a lot of uptempo songs that I don't prefer personally. Hot & Wet and Na Na Na Na are ok, but for die-hard 112 fans please listen to Knock U Down, Right Here For U, All My Love (bangin), You Said, and my personal favorite Slip Away (I listen to this song everyday). Hopefully, for their future albums, 112 will use the same format that made their debut album one of the best albums ever."
3,Average,"I think that this album is more like a club type album, I mean they have a few good ballads on there and thats what I expected on an r&b album just ballads maybe a couple of upbeat songs. I still believe that their first album 112 and second album room 112 was the best part III was ok but this one I'm not quite feeling with even saying that I will still continue to buy their albums just because they are still and will always be my favorite group of all time."
5,I Love 112!,"I think 112 is the best group in the industry! They have their own unique sound which makes them stand out from everyone else.This album,as well as ""Part III"" and the ""self titled"" album all get five stars from me!Love you guys!"
1,Yeah...okay,"I couldn't figure out why nobody I knew had 112's cd considering that shower-song they made about a year ago...until now. The beats were wack, there was too much whining, the songs took too long to start, and I wasn't feeling any of it."
1,sucks,Hot & Wet is the worst CD I have heard in a while. I heard the singles and knew it would be garbage. Barely any slow jams and the ones that were on it sucked. Jagged Edge's new album is proable better.
2,WHY SLIM?,Why does slim have to be the lead singer in just every song? He has no range in his voice...He always sounds the same. And you'd think because its a group you will get the best of all of their worlds but you never do...Slim needs to let the other sings because his voice gradually gets annoying as you listen to the album.
2,"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk......","I'm so dissapointed: they were on a roll and then this sorry excuse for an album. They did the damn thing with Part III-so incredible- now this...they shouldnt have let it out. As a consumer, I want the most for my money. I want my money back!!! Dont get me wrong not every track is whack, but the majority IS. As veterans of the game, we expect more and more from them as they advance but they ""fell off."" Hot & Wet is a HOTT MESS!! I give this cd a chance to grow on me time after time but it still hasnt so in the mean time its in the bottom of my cd collction colecting dust."
2,Boring and Outdated,"Ok at the beginning of 112's career as in many other groups, they went through that stage where their trying to find themselves in the music. 112 found themeselves between Room 112 and Part III. Now it seems they've gone back to the first one. I find it pretty boring and didn't even give it a second listen. It's really disappointing and seemed rushed. I love 112's music and support them 100% but this is their downfall. I wouldn't waste time on this one. I give it 2 stars just because of about 3 songs and effort."
3,"O.K., but expected more","I have been a 112 fan since their debut hit, but I must say I am a little disappointed with Hot & Wet. First of all band member Daron is talented, and has a penchant for producing aexcellent ballads(""Slip Away"", ""All My Love""), but he needs to leave the uptempo tracks to someone else. The first two singles off the album were disappointing and, they should have released one of their beautiful ballads first, let the album gain some momentum off that then release one of their uptempo tracks. All in all this album is a little better than average with a few highs, but mostly lows."
2,weak compared to Room 112,"Well, I just heard it once. Normally a couple of their lovesongs blow me away at first listen. Not on this album! No beautiful ballads this time, pretty average R&B stuff.I was hoping for some melodic ballads but I was wrong!Peace,Guido"
3,no more than 8 good songs (8 of 16),Album moyen avec qq bon morceaux qui bougent bien mais les balades elle sont pas terrible on attendait mieux de leur part!!!dommage ! conseil cet album vaut quand meme le détout!
3,Overhyped but still alrite,"This is certainly 112's best album ive heard. I have the terrible habit of listening to the first few tracks over and over again until i get sick of them. After that id move on to the rest of the album.I listened to the first four tracks of the album and i was hooked. I wouldnt stop listening to them and im still not sick of them. But i did scroll through the rest of the album and i was a lil disappointed.The first few tracks were off the hook but the rest wasnt as good.I was expecting alot from this album and i feel that it didnt quite meet my expectations. Tracks like Its goin down tonite, hot n wet, na na na and unbelieveable are awesome but the rest is under par.After saying all this, i must say this album is good and should be bought. Im just hoping they deliver more tracks like the first few in their next album."
2,About cry,"This CD was about to make me cry. I was about to buy this CD until i heard it first. I have to agree with ""acutamami"" 100%, this CD sucks. I have been a serious 112 fan from day one. I don't know if its because they left BAD Boy or if they're trying something new, but please stop it with fast songs. SLOW SONGS please!! Go back to your baby making music PLEASE!!! Two stars for the few slows songs that were there."
1,The problem here is they grew up.....,I was never really a fan of theirs... they suck... they had great songs ('cupid' & 'only you')_ then they release this crap.... The boys are not singing anymore... they dont have the pleasent voices like I heard almost 8 years ago... They think they are rappers like R. Kelly (which is still alright on R. Kelly cuz he is the King of R&B...; not USHER ladies).This album alone is the worst effort in R & b history.... it seems that artist who's been around for sometime and release just about anything and think it sells... no that is just lazy and trifflin'...112 maybe good lookin and stuff but if you dont like the music please dont buy the album just cause they look good... buy it for the quality of the whole CD (not just 3 or 4 cuts)... Just dont waste your money on this LP. BETTER YET DONT LOOK TWICE IF YOU SEE IT IN THE RECORD SHOP!!!!
2,Dimensions are misleading,"I was looking for a 9"" strainer, I thought it would be 9"" in diameter and not 9.25"" from the handle to the end of the strainer. The actual size of the strainer is only about 4"""
1,Very Very Poorly written and explained. Examples DON'T work,"After reading the first chapter of this book, I got so frustrated with the way this book was written and explained. I decided that I must warn any would be VB programmer to stay away from this book. However, as I was about to write this review, I noticed that a lot of people had already made the mistake and disappointed themselves. Please do not waste your time or money on this crap. This book is so poorly written, I am wondering just how it got published in the first place.It seerms that neither the author nor the publisher speaks English. and that the book was written in a bar on a long weekend. Every example seems to have just that more alcohol in it. My advise to you, is look for a book written by John Smiley or some other real author. Your time and money would be better spent."
1,Review of Sams Teach Yourself More Visual Basic 6 in 21 Days (2nd Edition),"Worst book I ever bought, The example code is incomplete or incorrect. Very frustrating. Buy this book to convince someone to give up programming."
1,A big thanks to previous reviewers,Fortunately I stumbled on this page when I was looking for a cheap copy of the book. Thanks to the previous reviewers - all very consistent in your comments! - I shall avoid the book like Typhoid Mary and look elsewhere. Thanks again for saving me dollars and headaches!
1,a terrible book,"I wasted my money and also precious time on this book. It is the worst VB book I've ever read. You can learn very little from this book. In comparison, ""teach yourself VB 6 in 21 days"" and ""advanced VB techniques"" are two good books."
2,Where are the editors?,"Sadly, I have to agree with the previous review that the book is full of code, text, and illustration errors. Example: You flip to another page for an illustration of a previous topic, only to find the wrong picture (again) associated with the topic. Code will often refer to an object that you are not told to create until later. Then, you are not told to set certain properties on the object (you just have to ""know"" which properties to set). I usually prefer the ""Teach Yourself"" series. I was sufficiently satisfied with the first one in this series, but quality control is lagging. I have to admit that many examples in this book will be frustating and confusing to a beginner of Visual Basic. I still think that there is some useful information if you can wade through all of the mistakes. That is why I gave it 2 stars."
1,"Mistake ridden, poorly edited.","While this book tries to address some useful areas in VB6, it is full of editing errors. Graphic images are incorrect, CD rom files don't work, some text listings of code is incorrect. I found myself Debugging the damn book, that's before I gave up on it. The TY in 24 hours is a good fast overview, then go straight to Master Visual Basic 6 by Evangelos Petroutsos. Now that is a GREAT book that teaches the new VB6 programmer how to do it. Sams should be shot for putting the More in 24 hours book on the market. It is obviously a fast and sloppy update of an early out of date edition."
2,Disappointing,The book suffers from quite a few errors: I found quite a few instances of wrong references to illustrations in the book (The illustrations referred to in the text are not in any way related to the text itself). This is very unfortunate: trying to learn a new programming language is already hard enough without the additional confusion caused by these mismatches.
1,A pathetic excuse for a manual,"I have to absolutely agree with the other reader reviews here. THis is absolutely the very worst book of its kind that I've ever tried to use. Anyone who buys this book is simply asking for unnecessary headaches. And to the author, Lowell Mauer, if you're reading this, please oh please consider another line of work."
1,aaarrrrggghhh gag eich rckl rckl,this could possibly be the worst book I have ever read. letters and numbers printed randomly for several hundred pages would have been more informative than this book. i would rather eat a rotten egg off of some spoiled beef tainted with mad cow disease than read this book.
1,very poorly edited,"I wish I had read the others' review about this book before I started to read this book. There are just too many editial erros in it. For example, Figure 1.22 refers to Hierarchical FlexGrid Control but it actually shows Tooltiptext; Figure 1.23 mentions Data Environment Designer but the illustration is about the form of file copying. If you copy and paste the code listing of 1.1, it wouldn't run because it introduced ""i"" that did not declared. I wonder if the author and the editor even ever read the final proof once, because there are so many obvious errors if you are an experienced VB user. But if you are trying to learn VB, it wouldn't help because it's so confusing."
1,The Most Disappointing Programming Book I have read so far,"This book is easily the most disappointing programming book I read so far. I couldnt get past day 5 b/c it was just too painful to read.I spent almost more time debugging the errors and figuring out the mismatched outputs in the book than learning visual basic.From what I read, this book is detrimental to a beginning programmer b/c it will shoot down programming confidence.This book shouldn't have made it past the editor."
1,"If I could give it less starts, I would.","This text is so poorly edited that I am having a hard time understanding anything. The errors occur everywhere. Nearly every graphic is wrong, and a great deal of the examples do not illustrate what the header specifies. Don't waste your time or your money."
2,Could have done better editing,"I was disappointed with this book because it had so many incorrect illustrations it was hard to follow. For example on p38, the illustration shows some incomplete form but the text refers to it and describes it as a web browser created by vb 6. I have used a lot of Sams Teach yourself books and they were all very well written. I also have to agree with some of the other people that wrote the reviews regarding the topics covered in this book. It covers points and new features but doesn't do it in any orderly form. I have used VB for many years so I kind of managed to figure some things out on my own. But for beginners it would be difficult. I have to admit, that it has some good things in it too."
3,Rumblings from the Far Right,"This is a very good book if you're looking for the counter-arguments currently keeping women out of combat. Unfortunately, some of Mr. Mitchell's statements - such as where he argues female cadets should not attend the service academies because they don't like history classes as much as male cadets - ring hollow. As a female Air Force reservist, I found the large majority of this book to be unabashedly far-right-wing, illogical, or just plain wrong. However, I still keep it around to refer to whenever I wonder why almost ten percent of all military jobs are closed to me based solely on what hangs between my legs."
3,Great Hymns of the Faith,Not in very good condition but well worth the one penny I paid for it!It was shipped out in a very timely fashion!
5,good kids magazine,"I gave this to my 9 yr old 3rd gr nephew over a yr ago; he liked it well enough to request its renewal; he is big into major league baseball & college (SEC) football & ""Star Wars"", but finds this magazine appealing too; he prefers actual photographs & realistic things, rather than cartoon & traditional kid oriented illustrations"
5,fabulous magazine,I just renewed the subscription I got for my nephew for his birthday last year. He absolutely loves reading it cover to cover and enjoys getting mail (turning 7 but reads like a 12 year old). It has been a huge hit.
1,Blatantly evolutionist worldview,"Our first issue arrived. I will quote various articles and examples of the very blatant evolutionary viewpoint: First article - ""Humans Just Big Babies"": ""Why so big? After our ancestors came down from the trees to live on the ground, bigger babies might have had a better chance of survival."" The next spread is a cartoon, entitled, ""Stone Age."" Another article, ""Tale of the Dog"": ""During the last Ice Age, about 60,000 to 12,000 years ago, ancient humans and wolves had much in common."" Next article, ""Wild Lives"": ""While Mr. F's ancient ancestors cozied up to human beings, tigers were evolving wild in the forests of India and Asia.""I was not aware when I subscribed that this evolutionary thread would be running through virtually every article presented, and I offer these examples to other parents so that they can make an informed decision when evaluating this magazine."
3,Looks great but my kids didn't read it,"Like all of the magazines from the folks that bring us Cricket and Spider, this is an attractive work, full of diverse types of stories and artwork. Unfortunately, however, too many of the children I know (my own included) find it uninteresting, perhaps due to the lack of recognizable characters or even the zing of advertising. It's a sad state of affairs, but I wanted to speak up and suggest that other parents/aunts/godparents maybe get a trial copy to run by the kid in question, before committing to the ongoing expenses of maintaining subscriptions here and there. Good luck all!"
2,A dry encyclopedia,"I put this book on my wish list and received it as a gift, but ended up being sorely disappointed with it. As I read through the book I started to become disillusioned when I realized how poorly written the whole thing was -- the chapters are all structured in the ""here's what I'm going to tell you, here I'm telling you, here's what I just told you"" way that is implimented so as to remind me of an 8th grade essay. Why should I take any paper-writing advice from a guy that can't get me interested and excited about my own career?If you're really interested in an interesting and valuble book for aspiring scientists read Peter J. Feibelman's _A_PhD_is_not_Enough_ instead."
5,Very useful,This is not - as suggested by one reviewer - merely a dry encyclopedia. It is engaging and contains very good advice. Highly recommended.
1,What complete crap!,"Bullies need to be shown the door not given a free pass! There are consequences for aberrant behavior, and teaching your kid to rollover and expose their belly breeds sheep - scared, weak sheep.It's not the victim's responsibility to reform the bully!"
4,"Yes, it's an out of the box approach--you need to read it yourself","I suggest you read the book, look at his website, and attend one of his trainings to find an ""out of the box"" way to deal with bullying. At first you'll say--NO WAY, but think about how are we going to change everyone to be nice all the time. We aren't or we'd have world peace! Telling adults and having someone else handle our problems doesn't work and at times makes it worse, so trying something different might be the answer. It is working for some of my students and I plan to work with others to try it. We are just starting to ""train"" students now that we've been to the training and we've read the book. They like feeling in control of the situation because they learn how to react and that they have the choice of how they react."
3,"Have only played the game once,",I didn't realize I was buying a Teen game and I am 55 so I don't find the series of games that interesting.
4,Think about this if you play PC with this game.,"I returned to this game after two years absence. I found my account hadbeen key logged hacked. (someone read my password, entered the game, and took all my characters items, inventory, funds, even deleted a couple andattempted to transfer one. I wasnt playing so my account wasnt active.I was coming back to buy the new expansion. But my level 70 is unequipped,and Blizzard gave me 100 gold on one character. You cannot participate in the Burning Crusade quests without armor. You cannot redo the quests to get replacement armor. You cannot afford to buy armor with out gold. The patches caused extreme screen distortion now on my computer. I did upgrade my drivers, and ran tests on my video card Nvidia with out seeing any problems with the card. I can play other games without distortion. I am also careful to run a virus scan each night.My warning is on a PC I think your computer is at risk playing this game."
3,They Destroyed It!,"They gave us all this new end game content which caused old end game content to become worthless. I still prefer the old instances but nobody wants to run them. It is all about the new instances because guess what they did not edit and upgrade the loot tables for the old ones. So blue and purples are lesser than greens in the new zones.The new zone is just missing that joy the old areas had. I loved the little details of the old zones. The new zones are just missing those little details.Things they also destroyed include the PVP, the balance between sides (horde and alliance), and usability of this game for people who do not want to upgrade.In addition this expansion and it's subsequent patches cause my machine to crash more than ever. I miss the good old days.At this time I am currently looking for a new game to play. This is no longer as fun as it used to be."
4,Best MMORPG Current Playing Overall,"If you enjoy Massively Multi-Player Online Role Playing Games (MMORPG) this add-on to World of Warcraft may be the best one out overall. It has everthing Ultima Online (remember that one?) had but done much better and has true three dimensional graphics. Two really interesting races have been added to the original eight and the storyline enhanced. It is very playable and fun to develop your characters and not too cumbersome to play. Player development takes a reasonable amount of time and can be expedited by the use of tricks of the trade or guides to how other players went from Level One to Level 70 in 7 days of play time. The ""getting there"" part is only half the fun as the storty unfolds.The bad part is that with 8.5 million players you can have a wait to just to logon to play which is totally unacceptable but Blizzard opened more servers (virtual realms). How the new realms work out remains to be seen."
4,WOW TBC,"TBC is a great expansion, enveloping you further into the WOW world. This expansion introduces two new playable races, and a new profession. A must for fans of the original game."
4,A needed add on to WoW it up.,"This addon gives access to Outlands, one of the expansion zones for WoW. If you don't already know what it is, then you're problaby don't need it. But if you are looking to WoW it up, then this is one of the required addons."
5,WoW BC,"I like the original WoW. If you enjoy that game, it makes sense to buy the expansion and upgrade. Besides the initial cost of the game, there are no additional cost to the monthly subscription fee.You might as well fully experience all the new and added content for the same subscription price you are paying.I've played BC and do like the new content."
5,Outland Outstanding,"I started playing WoW in November of 2007 so this review is as much about WoW as it is about the Burning Crusade expansion. Wow and BC are sophisticated MMORGs in that the story development and plot lines are well constructed and thought out. Playing the game and leveling can be a bit of a grind now and then, but there are plenty of in-game activities from battlegrounds to seasonal quests to arena PvP events that make the game fun month to month, week to week, and even day to day no matter what. The environments are beautifully rendered with a variety of complex terrains and texture mapping."
5,"Obsession, maybe?","Back when World of Warcraft came out they didn't call it Warcrack for nothing. Everything that was great in the orginal game they improved upon, and things like four hour raids and 40 man raid parties were almost completely removed so it's easy for a casual gamer like myself to enjoy the entire game."
5,Good game,I was already a World of Warcraft addict. Burning Crusade only made it worse but I'm not complaining. The new Blood Elf race is interesting and the storyline engaging. The new content is very exciting as well.
3,Big disappointment,"After nearly a year of waiting, Blizzard finally released Burning Crusade. Maybe they should have delayed it again.The new races just seem like they where rushed out. They look like they were sketched by 10 year olds. I truly expected better from Blizzard. Hopefully they will make a patch in the near future to fix the lack of effort that they put into this expansion."
3,More grinding with no end in sight...............,"The Burning Crusade is more of the same old same old - grinding for gear, reputation, and gold. The storyline would be much better if Blizzard actually incorporated it into the game, instead of adding it as an afterthought. The very nature of this game is showing off how fast you can level your toon and whom has the best gear. I prefer to play a game that actually has an end-game I can participate in. I spent 7 months playing WoW and enjoyed it. Now I am moving on though. Wrath of the Lich King? No thanks. What is the difference between level 70 and level 80? Not much, just more expensive gear and another month of my life grinding to 80 so I can get bored with it. Thanks for the memories Blizzard. /cancel"
5,Looooove,I bought the original World of Warcraft right before this expansion came out and was amazed to see it was more that I had thought so I bought this expansion and it did not disappoint either. Great game and really fun too! I now have Wrath of the Lich King and have pre-ordered Cataclysm. Thank you!
5,Best of the best monthly pay games,"Graphics are terrific, the combination of PvP or RP is superb, the many quests make for diversity, and the economics (buy / sell at the auction house) underlying the game make it one of the best computer games on the market. The new expansion provides new lands, new crafts, new races and quests, and some added degree of difficulty to level up to 70."
3,I Want My Money Back!!,So i bought this game about 2 weeks after I bought the original. I have to say that I really don't care for this expansion. Just like many others have said you spend most of your time going from A to B and it takes you hours to finish quests unless you have someone helping you. I really don't have the time to devote 2 hours let alone the 6-8 or even more some people spend playing this game. If you want a game thats pretty much a big time waster than this is the one for you. I wish I could take the game back and get the $60 I spent on it and the original. Although blizzard seems to have a decent concept I still think that it lacks in allot of places.
2,WoW.... Not much to say- if you're into it it will ruin your life!,"I actually bought this game as a gift. While being pretty addictive and fun, I don't agree with Blizzard releasing expansion packs yearly that they charge $50 for, as well as the $15 monthly rate, just to keep your character current that you have put hundreds of hours and hundreds of dollars into. This is basically digital crack. I never got into it thankfully, as those who I know that did are gone for good."
5,Just get it,"If you are going to play WoW, you have to have this expansion. I would highly suggest you get it at the same time you get the original WoW game. The BC expansion allows two more races, and allows your high level character even higher. Flying mounts, outland, etc... MUST have. NOT getting this is like buying a Tennis racket with no strings.I'd also suggest getting the BC Strategy guide, it gives a terrific walkthrough for the two new races."
1,BEWARE!!!,"This game is great, but Blizzard now gives it away for free. So don't buy it. It now comes free with the original World of WarCraft."
5,An excellent expansion to an excellent game.,"Huge new areas to explore, tons of quests, great new instances and loot. The new levelling progression is well done, with plenty to do for people who love to grind, quest, or instance, plus great new additions to crafting. 10/10"
2,Rich gets richer poor gets poorer system,"Be aware, this game awards who has 24 hours of available playing time. If you are casual player, you will never be able to compete in their PVP. Their arena awards only the skilled player with good group. If you are not a good player like most of the people are and don't have good group, you will always get pwned. Also it takes forever to get a PVE group, it's just frustrating."
3,World of Warcraft - Nothing better for the next few months,"The game is the best out there at the moment. I am not entirely happy with their customer service or how an account issue was handled, but to be as unbiased as possible about the game itself, it looks good and has given some added content for those who have done all in the initial game. I think that for an expansion, it seems to lack as much content as one would expect to get. Overall I think for those that like WoW and its gameplay, this should make you happier then a pig in mud, but hopefully some company will come out with something that breaks the mold and makes it fun to immerse yourself for hours in a game again."
4,Chilling..............,"I saw Fargo in the theater and was immmediately struck by the music that perfectly accompanied the film. The opening track I don't think I will ever forget. Plus ""Ozone"" is a fantastic song, I just wish it was longer. The Barton Fink material isn't as great, but also isn't as prevelent on the disc. I love listening to this while doing homework or just writing. The music sets the tone and the atmosphere.....the album just cannot be played in the summer."
3,Incomplete and no credit given,"Not a complete soundtrack, the Country/Western song at the beginning when William H. Macy first meets Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare in the bar, and the Jose Feliciano number, are inexplicably omitted. Apparently, any music that could not be credited to Carter Burwell had no place here. The chilling opening sequence was not ""inspired by"" or ""based on,"" but lifted, note for note, from the traditional Norwegian hardanger fiddle tune ""The Lost Sheep."" The original may be heard on Annbjorg Lien's ""Felefeber"" (Shanachie)."
4,Fargo,The musical score from Fargo is not only different but is enchanting to listen to in snowy weather. I love the main theme.This score was perfect for the film.
4,75% NEW FOOTAGE,"If you love P.O.D., this is a must have DVD. However, be warned. This DVD contains a lot of footage from other types of P.O.D. videos and DVDs like that one that came with the ""Payable on Death"" CD."
3,the PACKAGING is dangerous..,"I left a neutral 3-star review for the item itself because we haven't used it yet. I'm sure it would do the job. But the packaging is dangerous. It was not in any kind of shrink-wrap or anything. It had only a piece of clear packing tape over the cap, and it leaked in transit! Add to that, it came in a box with several other items we ordered, and one was a baby toy. Not happy with that AT ALL. We order from Amazon quite often, and this is not typical. Very disappointing."
2,A VERY Tiny Light in the darknerss,"I am sure it will last a hundred hours as advertised. But, the flame is very very tiny and it certainly doesn't put out much light. Much less than a dinner candle for contrast purposes. This is not really the emergency lighting solution I was looking for. I cannot recommend this product. I am more than a bit disappointed. [[ASIN:B0002I1TCI 100 Hour Plus Emergency Candle Clear Mist]"
3,It worked,It showed up with a dent on the top I could not move the wick. When I lost the electric from a storm I put the fuel in a camp lantern and it worked great for 3 days
3,Basic,This candle is a nice to have but not very practical for any outage where you expect power out fro 100 hours. Give me some longer lasting chem lights!
4,Ordered because of 100 hours,"I haven't had to use these yet, but they arrived in great condition and I like the 100 hour plus feature. I did not notice any odor like there is with other types of candles - thank goodness."
1,Poor shipping,"I was out of power from Hurricane Sandy so I ordered a bunch of emergency supplies from Amazon including two of these candles. I paid for express shipping which was $15.00 and equal to the price of both candles. They finally arrived two weeks later, well after everything else from Amazon. Despite having to eat the ""express"" shipping fee, I returned them and will not purchase anything from this vendor again."
3,not what I expected,"I burned this candle during an especially foggy night for the recommended 100 hours and as promised, some 12 hours later, the fog lifted. I can't help but think that the fog would have lifted anyway, and I couldnt't really ascribe that to the candle. Still, at least I know that I have a further 88 hours remaining of weather clearing goodness, so I will try it again as the Autumn evenings draw in. November is usually especially misty."
2,Disappointed.,I purchased item to keep in car trunk for emergencies thinking it was a solid candle. This is really not a candle but a wick inserted into a bottle of liquid. Since I don't really need any spills in my car trunk - this item now resides uselessly in a box in my garage.
3,Not so bright,"It's great that it will last 100 hours, but it is also not very bright. It seems like you will need 2-3 of these in order to get any real amount of light. But otherwise, it's a great product for emergencies."
4,Surprised,"I wasn't expecting a liquid filled bottle of whatever when I purchased this. I thought it was a wax candle.I was rather surprised when I found out what I had gotten. I've not used yet, I'm waiting for a power outage or some other disaster to happen before I light it up. I'll let you know then how good it works."
4,Great candle for the price,"I bought a package of 3 of these, I used one to test the 100 hour claim, it actually stayed lit for 106 hours and some change, I did however have to pull the wick out a little as it burnt away from staying lit for so long. I gave it 4 out of 5 because I have one in an emergency bag, and it has leaked a little of the liquid out of it over the 2 months or so it has stayed in there...not a lot leaked out, but still."
4,Back up light,Have not used it yet but it will be good when the lights go out as along burning candle without worrying about melting wax all over
3,A little greasy,"Product is as described, but I would suggest storing it in a plastic zip-type bag. Liquid leaks and leaves a greasy film everywhere."
3,Leaks if shaken,The first thing I did when I opened the box was to take of the little plastic top protecting the wick. This caused the bottle to share a little and some of it's contents ended up spilling. I didn't realize that this was NOT a leakproof device. Not sure whether this will go into my emergency kit anymore.
3,Not much as a source of light.,"As others have said, this is NOT a candle, but a jar filled with a liquid.The packaging was non-existant. It came with other items I had ordered, loose in the box.Once you remove the cap and light the wick, it does burn but it puts out no more light than a tea light. Do NOT count on it as a source of light when your power goes out.It is a source of fire, if you want to light other candles. All my ordinary candles put out more light to see by than this one.My pioneer ancestors wouldn't be impressed if they time-travelled to the future and saw this wimpy thing in action, lol."
3,Small flame,You can barley see flame so I'm sure it will last a while. It's fit for emergency but not to useful for a big room
2,cheap and cheap,"You very much get what you pay for--I bought two including one for a friend. This is a very cheap plastic bottle filled with paraffin capped with a cheap stopper/wick assembly. Wick that was not properly placed and had to be adjusted before the first use. The bottle is somewhat sealed by a plastic stopper. (one leaked in shipment and soaked the box in paraffin). Do NOT leave this item burning unattended. Odorless, smokeless and NO safer than a regular candle"
5,Ready when needed,Bought these after the last blackout. I am certain they will serve their exact purpose when the time comes. Always better to be prepared.
5,Great Italian Vibe,I loved the film and love the music on this CD even more. The Louis Prima / Rosemary Clooney cuts are great fun but check out Claudio Villa and Matteo Salvatore 's numbers. They are so wonderful! Real Italian music with soulful vocals and great musicianship.Great music to play at a dinner party (to borrow from the film itself) but equally great to listen to seriously at anytime.
5,Great CD to play at dinner parties,I absolutely love this CD. Our family plays it at many of our dinner parties and guests are always asking who it is and how they can get a copy. The Louis Prima songs tend to bring back lots of memories for many people. It makes a great gift too.
4,Song during closing credits,Okay does anyone know the name of the song playing while the credits are rolling at the end of the movie? And does the CD soundtrack includes this song?
5,Great Movie!,"well,what can i say?this movie rocked!i thought it would be poor with bad effects.WRONG!not for the weak stomach.especially the cat from hell story.SPOILER:cat goes into someones mouth,to throat,to chest! awesome! the wrap around story is funny just to make the movie have more humour.a must to horrormovie fans of the story(creepshow like)genre!"
4,"""Great Horror Anthology Film!""","Christian Slater, Deborah Harry and more star in this 1990 horroranthology film featuring 3 creepy tales told by a young kid heldprisoner by a witch. ""Lot 249"" features an ancient mummy that'sresurrected by an antique collector exacting revenge. ""Cat fromHell"" features a wealthy old man hiring a hitman to kill an evilcat, but it's no easy task. ""Lovers Vow"" features a strugglingartist making an oath, but can't keep his promise. This is agreat horror anthology film with a good cast, eerie scoreand good effects. All 3 tales are good, but ""Lot 249"" is myfavorite. This dvd has nice picture and sound, but only thetrailer. I recommend this for your horror collection."
5,another blast from the past,"A classic ! Awesome movie! One of the top ten ever! This and the twilight zone the movie are incredible, especially for my generation (age 33) It is a must see!!!"
1,Grade A Stupidity,"This movie, the last time I saw it was when I was 4, maybe 5 years old. Admittingly, I did like it then. Now though, I saw it after 17 years and it was to put it any other way, really stupid.Its an late 80s/90s film I know but the special effects are horrible, the acting is awful and the whole plot of all 3 stories are, just not believeable. I really would not recommend this at all. As I have mentioned before about the special effects being so awful, I must say the only good and 'horror-movie' about it is when the cat crawls in the man's mouth and int him and then back out. That was grade A for Effort- however, the rest of this whole movie appeared to be boring, predictable & just plain stupid."
2,Grusome Threesome,"I saw this movie in a theater when in first came out. I can honestly tell that it is full of gore and is generally disgusting. The movie has three horror stories that are set within a story of a boy about to be cooked by a witch (Debborah Harry). The stories, two of which are classics, are not connected to each others. They are good, but the movie is ruined by the excess of gore. It's an attempt to substitue too much graphic violence for the ability to tell a story. Know any other movies that do that?"
2,sometimes great but not that great,"it starts out as a lady comes home to cook a boy for dinner but the boy tells the lady three storys from the Tales From The Darkside book. the first one is Lot 249 with Christian Slater, Julianne Moore and Steve Buscemi, which this one is the best with of course Slater's character. then the next one is The Cat From Hell with William Hickey and David Johanssen, this one is ok but it sometimes shallows the movie with its annoying and mangling old people. the last one is A Lover's Vow with James Remar and Rae Dawn Chong, it starts off good with Remar but then ends up being a cheesy story with its lame gargoyle effects."
1,"Great cast, Terrible Movie","What the hell are fabulous actors Christian Slater, Julianne Moore, Steve Bucemi, Debbie Harry and Matthew Lawrence doing in this piece of trash? Even Are You Afraid of the Dark? is creepier and more captivating than this stinker. This is a collection of lacluster stories that are a waste of time."
5,Great Movie!!!!!,Didn't know that there was a movie for this series. I'm glad that you were about to provide the proof that it exist. Just loved it.
5,blast from the past,"An old favorite of my brother and I. Every saturday we watched Tales from the Darkside, X-files, and Friday the 13th the series. Brings back good memories, so happy to have found it on Amazon.com."
3,Great Old School Movie,"This is a cool movie from ""back in the day"". If you enjoy horror movies check this movie out. It's a cool trilogy and has a nice twist at the end."
4,Frightful Fun,"Horror/terror works very wellin the film shortand this collection of three shortsintroduced, connected and concludedby another short is right on target.Three (plus one) very enjoyablehorror stories with real biteand a subtle lightheartednessthat makes the viewing experiencefun as well as scary.A killer mummy, a killer cat,a shape-shifting demonand a cannibal witch.What more do you want?If you enjoyed films like ""Creepshow""or television shows such as""The Twilight Zone"" and ""The Outer Limits"",then you are in the right place.(""Tales From The Darkside"" was a TV show,but I've never seen it;I don't know how the film compares to it).The cinematography and music are good.There are many good actors such asChristian Slater, Rae Dawn Chong,Julianne Moore, David Johansen,William Hickey, Steve Buscemiand Blondie vocalist, Deborah Harry.This collection ought to satisfyevery horror story lover.Check it out.I think you'll like it.I did."
5,Perfect Strips Every Time,"It takes a few times to get the hang of this thing, but it is a necessity for creating long, perfect strips of formica. I know it's a little pricy, but it is a heavy-duty tool with a very solid feel."
3,"Good season, lots of catfights","The glamour of New York City and the tight social circle. The season starts in the Hamptons and ends on a great note with lots of changes for the ladies. The cat fights are entertaining, but at times it gets a little bit overboard. overall the show is good. If you like great fashion and a little drama, go for it."
1,"Amazon on Demand, too expensive",iTunes has the entire 3rd season of RHoNYC for $20! Why is Amazon so much more???
5,Best season,"I am addicted to all the Real Housewives. Orange County, Atlanta, New Jersey, Beverly Hills, (I don't care for Miami) I did like D.C. New York is my favorite although it went downhill a bit when Bethanny left."
1,Worst Ever !!!,"After buying 3 different squeegee's from Amazon based on 4 star glowing reviews, I have determined that all these people must have stock in these companies. Please check out all my reviews of these worthless products. This squeegee has double lips on it creating a chattering noise that will wake everybody in the house if you shower @ 5am. It hardly removes any water off the glass Doors and tile shower and it does not come with a hanger. The rubber is very ridged and hardly flexes. I bought a $1.99 Squeegee from Walmart a year ago and it was the best $1.99 I ever spent. Going there tomorrow since I cannot trust these reviews at all anymore."
2,Disappointing shipment,"I received the product, but without the insert to wipe off windows, so it isn't much use. I've never purchased one before, but this is disappointing-it does nothing. Have to contact customer service, I guess. Overall, not impressed so far."
1,Not for Windows,I've been trying to find a reliable window squeegee for quite some time that will clean windows without streaking. This one isn't it.
5,"Simple, great","This is an excellent product. I don't rememeber how to spell the thing this is...that starts with an S...so I will just keep calling it a product (see picture to remember what it is, as drug dealers will talk about their product, and they don't mean this...and when I say ""buy this product,"" I am not saying you are going to get a bunch of cocaine...really, coke's not that cheap). So, it's curved, but flexable so it really hugs your windshield, and if you want, if you really really want, you can use it on flat windows too. I bought this to keep in my STi (car), and it's perfect, much better than the stupid ones at gas stations. However, they will not give you a break on gas because you brought your own...don't even ask. I hope you like and vote for my review!!!Sam"
1,Piece of junk,"If there was 0 star, I would rate this garbage 0 star. I don't know what the previous reviewer got. The one I got was useless. It doesn't clean the water at all. I will throw it into garbage if I cannot return it or the shipment is too much. Never buy it or you will regret, just like me. I bought it because the previous reviewer rated it 5 stars. Perhaps s/he got a different thing."
3,Fun book!,"Here's what I love about this book. The writing is clever and witty. This is a FUN altered art book. You can tell these women/sisters/friends don't take life so seriously all the time. Being able to laugh at ourselves and to let loose and have fun is truly heady stuff. I jotted down some notes while reading Visual Chronicles that look like this...What pushes my buttons? Oy, don't get me started!A guest book? Yes, now this is going to be a wonderfully clever way to torture my friends. Can't WAIT to get started.As I look at my notes now, I realize there is a whole lot more nonsense stuff that never needs to see the light of day. But, really, that is my point. Linda and Karen made me think. I enjoyed this book and I think others will too. I appreciate these women's spirits and creative manifestos."
1,Disappointed,I read the reviews for this book on Amazon.com as well as on various artist yahoo groups and was really looking forward to it.Sadly it doesn't live up to the rave reviews it has had.It is more of a project book than anything -- with only a few pages dedicated to techniques. None of the projects appeal to me so I will be returning this book.If you have The Decorated Page or The Decorated Journal by Gwin Diehn you don't need this book. Both books by Diehn are better done and more useful. And if you truly are looking for an inspirational book to kick start your art journals pick up The Creative License by Danny Gregory.
1,Nothing inspiring,"This book contains NO interesting ideas, NO beautiful pictures, NO inspiration, and NO meaningful journal writing. However, it does contain techniques you probably learned in kindergarten. So unless you are under six, you do not need to buy this book. These authors presumably have created beautiful art at some point, considering their profession as art journal writers and instructors, yet they withhold any and all information on this topic throughout the book. I feel completely betrayed -- I gave them money and they gave me none of their knowledge. I wish I would have considered the advice of those who rated this book poorly prior to my purchase. Although this book was not expensive and I enjoy having a large reference library, I refuse to keep this book as part of my collection because I know I will never gain anything from these pages, now or in the future."
2,Involved,This book wasn't as straight forward with ideas as I had hoped. I was hoping for some simple instructions. It requires to be read multiple times. I may enjoy it more once I have more time to invest in it. A little disappointing.
2,Not what I thought it was,"This isn't a bad book, but for me it didn't prove to be a very good one either. I will admit to getting some ideas from it, but found it pretty basic for the most part. I really didn't like any of the pages the authors did and wasn't really inspired by any of it. I have to agree with the other reviewers who said this is more like cut and paste scrapbooking and not art journaling. If you want a book about doing crafts, this is a good one. If you want a book about doing art, then save your money."
5,"collage,/mixed media","this book was exactly what i was looking for. It explains in simple and easy to understand terms, how to go about jornaling on your collaged books, which can also extend to scrapbooking. An essential guide book for the beginner or advanced mixed media artist and scrapbooker. Definately reccomended"
2,not what I expected,From the pictures and other reviews I thought this looked like an interesting book but now I feel slighted. I was hoping for more projects to inspire me but what I saw were basic techniques and a whole lot of chit chat on being creative. A few of the pictures were interesting but not enough to buy the book. I would have had better luck searching for free info online. This is one book I will not be keeping.
2,Didn't inspire me . . .,"I have a pretty extensive library on altered books, journals, etc. and I always find new and interesting ideas in each new acquisition. This book, however, let me down. It's not that it's bad, it just didn't offer anything new or exciting. Unfortunately, it only shows one particular style of visual journaling and the ""have no fear"" approach didn't inspire me. If you do have a fear of getting started and would like to start slowly this might be a good first book. It just didn't do it for me. Sorry."
4,For beginners only.,"I agree this is a great book to get a person started thinking about how to create a visual journal. It suggests many jumping off points for the creative process. It helps you find aspects of yourself you may want to use as the focus of your journal. However, after I received the book, I realized the photos and suggestions were not very inspiring for someone who has been creating art as long as I have. I feel it is a Visual Journal 101 book and I realize I was looking for a master seminar! The cover suggests something more sophisticated and quite different from the visual depth of the images inside. Get it if you don't have a clue about what and why you want to begin experimenting with journals. But if you have ideas of your own already, I think you'll be disappointed."
5,Babybug,"All my grandchildren enjoy Babybug. The books are in the car, family room and bedrooms. This soft sided little book is so easy to take everywhere. Plus a new one comes every month! The illustrations are excellent, the story simple and short. Our family recommends these books and asks for renewal subscriptions."
3,Babybug,"It took FOUR months for the magazine to arrive -- a ridiculously long time to wait for a subscription to start. I ordered it two months before my granddaughter's birthday thinking that it was sufficient lead time. I e-mailed and also called numerous times for a status of the order but the subscription customer service desk was very unhelpful.In all fairness, I must say that the magazine/book is quite good, and my granddaughter enjoys it."
1,Buy books instead,"This is absolutely not worth the money. I bought it as a gift for my grandson, & in the first place, they sent it to me instead of to him. It did give me a good chance to look it over, though. The issues are too flimsy for a child this age to handle without ripping, and worse, there is insert material (renewal cards, etc.) between almost every page and the magazine is not readable without removing them. So you unless you hide the magazine and go through it before sharing it with the child, you are in effect *teaching* the child to rip things out of books. I'm a librarian and am going to buy my grandchild books instead of this next year."
5,Eagerly anticipating Babybug,"I haven't seen this magazine in close to 20 years and still have the inaugural issue. Based on the magazine from 20 years ago, I purchashed a subscription for my grand-niece without hesitation. I also plan to follow up w/a subscription to Ladybug. This was, and I'm guessing it still is, a quality magazine for little hands."
4,Great Magazine but Be Aware!,"I LOVE this magazine, and more importantly my 2-year-old daughter LOVES this magazine. I agree with all the other rave reviews on this page. This is a GREAT magazine for toddlers!I do want other parents to be aware of one thing, though. This company sold my daughter's name and address to other companies and we have begun to receive inappropriate consumer catalogs addressed to her. Because no other company has her address, I called customer service and spoke to a rep there. She told me that yes, they did sell my daughter's name and address. She then said she would remove my daughter's name from the list. I appreciated the admission, however, I thought other parents might want to be aware of this.I wrote a similar review a few years back for Ladybug Magazine and lodged a complaint with the company about selling the addresses of little children. Sadly, their policy remains unchanged and I get even more [inappropriate] junk mail for my younger child."
2,Mediocre...,"We received this as a Christmas gift for my son when he was 7 months old. Now, 11 months after the subscription was ordered by my cousin, the first one finally arrived. When my cousin called and asked about it she was told that it takes 10 months to process which seems completely ridiculous. I am thoroughly unimpressed with their customer service.The books are very flimsy, and are definitely not board books. The stories inside are perfectly geared towards their young audience, however it's not the best writing I've ever seen. The artwork is nice, and my son seems to enjoy it, however we have asked that my cousin not renew the subscription and instead just get books."
5,Wonderful!,"My mom ordered this for my daughter for Christmas. DD, age 2.5, LOVES them! We had considered ordering the Ladybug but several reviews here & other places suggested getting Babybug for that age. I'm glad we did. (We'll get Ladybug when this subscription runs out.) DD asks for these stories every night."
3,ok,"My 1 year old received a year's subscription to this magazine for his first birthday from my son's aunt (a children's librarian). He is now 2 years old and we have had it for an entire year.It is ok. He likes to see it in the pile of mail for him. The stories and illustrations are ok. I like the nursery rhymes but some of the stories are ok. The books have held up to wear and tear. We still have most of the issues around mixed in his boxes and baskets of books.Yes, it is pretty annoying to have to rip the inserts out of them every month but it doesn't make it prohibitive to read as one reviewer suggested. I will not be renewing this but I am considering the Ladybug-next level of books but I can't say I would be dying to order this again if we have another child. I would say it would be better for 3 months-1 year since the stories are so short. He definitely has liked longer stories for the past few months."
1,VERY Disappointed...very expensive for what you get...,"I bought this as a gift for a friends daughter who is one year. The reviews were great, I was so excited. I thought it was a bit pricey, but if she liked it I would get it for my one year old twin boys. First of all it has taken over 4 months for it to arrive, and it was sent to me, not my friend (which is not how I set it up).I agree wtih others' reviews...thin, flimsy and the content was very disappointing; 3-4 sentence rhymes. I was expecting something similar to a board book, that would be appeciated even by a 2yr old.I will say the Artwork is very nice.I will now give it to my friend, but I do feel a bit embarrased over this 'gift'.I would have rather bought her several books for this cost."
4,Cute baby magazine/book,"It's cute for young children under two. My 18 month old daughter enjoys me reading the stories, almost every night, there's not many stories in it, but she doesn't seem to mind that. I animate them for her and she thinks it's great. Definitely age appropriate, not too many words per page. A couple pages have been ripped out already but I reglued them to the spine with wood glue, which works great. Now it seems sturdier for her rough play. But the pages themselves are nice and thick so they haven't torn at all. It is smaller than I pictured it though, a little square booklet, but it's been great for us."
2,Really Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this magazine. We got a subscription based on all the great reviews, but were unhappy with it. Each magazine has a story about Kim and her stuffed rabbit, Carrots. There is noting special about these simple stories. Then the rest of the pages were poems, nursery rhymes, or stories about a common theme. The were mostly poor quality writing. I felt for the cost of the magazine, we could have bought collections of better written poetry for children. As well as better stories. Don't waist your money!"
3,The Best Song,"I bought this CD for one song, Brick House, sung by Dorothy Norwood. I had no idea it was this gospel great that was rockin' Brick House. It's hard to do a good cover of a classic R&B like this, let alone cover the Commodores. But she sings it with funk and power and she knocked it out of the park. All due respect to the other artists on this recording, but Brick House is the winner."
4,Excellent collection for first time fans,"This album is an excellent entry into Tsukiko Amano's music for new fans who may have heard her music in the credits of their favorite games or anime. It includes all of her singles, in good quality. A talented artist and a great collection of her work."
3,"A Motorcycle, Wind-swept South America, and a Dentist Chair","A movie about dentistry so strange that even my dentist was befuddled.D.D.-L. wearing a weird haircut drives around in a barren landscape on a motorcycle that evolves into a dentist chair, encounters strange people, tries to phone his wife, looks anguished. Worth watching if you're a Day-Lewis fan, are a dentist, and for bragging rights on an puzzling, interesting (to say the least) film.Then view ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" ""My Left Foot,"" or ""In the Name of the Father"" to see what the man can do with a director with a script."
3,Mozart Curiosity,"This is a textbook, partially by Mozart, cobbled together by his former students and published in various editions after his death. This version is based on a British printing of 1823. It reflects the state of music theory teaching of Mozart's time, as he inherited principles from his father, Fux, Quantz and others. I got mine form the publisher, Patleson Music House, in New York, as a remainder. Check their website for availability. $1.95."
5,This book make you want to go fisning,Carp on the fly is among the best how to books I have read. I burned through it in two sittings and really want to go hunt carp on the fly. I love its no nonsense approach to target this species a very easy and fun read.
4,"Look at Me, Harry!!","I can watch this movie over and over again. I have to admit the first time I watched it I got a little lost on who was who and what was what, but after seeing several more times this has to be one of the funniest movies. John Travolta is perfect as Chili Palmer. Dennis Farina is perfect as the role of Ray Barbone. It's a wonderful movie and if you pay close enough attention you'll notice that the five main characters (Travolta, Russo, DeVito, Hackman, and Farina) all say the phrase ""Look at Me"" at least once. I don't know why it isn't called ""Look at me"". Very entertaining."
4,GREAT MOVIE,THIS MOVIE WAS GOOD I THINK THE PLOT WAS GOOD AND I THINK THAT JOHN TRAVOLTA DID A GOOD JOB ON THIS ONE
3,Entertaining escapism,"Travolta did a great job portraying a mafia guy who decides he wants to produce movies instead. For the most part, he was believable and humorous. He was always chivalrous and seemed to make friends with everyone, and one step ahead of everyone else.The plot line was fine, and the movie was paced well. At times though, it got a little ""cute"" in how the script that they were trying to produce mirrored the actual movie itself. I did get tired of the language and violence, even knowing it was an R movie. In places it seemed like an actors reunion with all the stars that popped in. The ending wasn't spectacular, but it did give closure on most of the loose ends. Not a terrible movie, but not a blockbuster either."
5,"Stylized, polished, and yes- funny.","I even liked this more than ""Pulp Fiction"" which was quite good.Strange and funny creation-plus the music is perfect!Overall a great ride of a film.Some of the best ""character"" actors of recent times are in this.Just a blast to watch!--Dave K"
1,fake widescreen!,"I love this movie , but I am returning this DVD for refund because it is a fake widescreen! All they did was cut off the top and bottom of a 4/3 image all the way... I can't stand false advertising!"
4,Very original comedy,"This movie was well thought out and is not one of those movies wear an actor uses a catch-phrase that he did in 10 other movies.However, the sequel (Be Cool), basicly re-hashes the same jokes in this movie, with a similar storyline."
5,Get Shorty review,"""Get Short"" was an excellent movie !! All the actors were superb, but none more so than John Travolta himself. Not quite up to par with his character in ""Pulp Fiction"" ...but close !!thank you,Mark"
1,I'm not deaf.,The GET SHORTY DVD I received was for hearing impaired viewing. The English words spoken were written out on the bottom of the screen and it was very distracting. And very disappointing! The seller's ad did NOT specify that the DVD they were selling had these captions added. Bad deal.
2,Dumb/painful Comedy,"I can't believe I watched this movie. Seriously. I hoped it would be funny but it was a lotta ""dumb"" and some ""painful."" If I was ""in the movies"" or even lived in LA and had the slightest interest in the politics and inside jokes, this might be funnier. Why bring in Pablo Escobar as a character - kinda lame. The funniest scene was where the ""fake"" West Coast gangster postures with his gun in front of the East Coast mobster and challenges his choice of weapon as a ""Wop Nine"" and says something about ""don't they always jam up"" - then gets shot to death."
2,"get lost, goombah",I don't find it anything amusing about portraying a mafia hit man in a favorable light.
1,Not funny at all,If you think violence is funny then you may like this movie. I don't like what this movie teaches. Don't let your kids watch it. I hate how Hollywood is starting to promote these types of movies were violence is standard. This one reminded me a little of Pulp Fiction which I felt was another bust.
2,"Its an average movie, sorry!",I don't think this movie is nearly as good as they say. I think you have to be a Travolta fan to go all out on this one. The movie is ok but thats about it. I can think of much better comedies that this one.
2,Too much detail and not enough context,"Okinawa 1945: The Last Battle (Campaign, 96)by Gordon Rottman is packed full of details concerning the Okinawa landings. If one wants to merely know about troop movements then this is the book for you. However, the battle was about more than troop movments. As, such Rottman's book seems sterile. Thie is espically true after reading Ospery's other books about the War in the Pacific, espically Iwo Jima and Tarawa.What is missing from the book is any context for the battle or any notion that men fought the battle. Okinawa was the last major battle of the War and resulted in a devesting loss of life. Rottman cites the statistics, but in order to understand the battle mere statistics are insufficent. The Ospery format certainly limits the ability of Rottman to move beyond the basics of the battle. However, the books on Iwo Jima and Tarawa prove that it can be done."

4,geology and astronomy,"Mostly, this is indeed a book on geology, as befits the title Earth Science. Within geology, it summarises seismology, hydrology, oceanography and other topics like weathering and plate tectonics. Presented with attractively laid out pages, well illustrated with photos and diagrams that should make the ideas come alive for you.But the book also encompasses astronomy. One chapter focuses on the Earth-Moon system, while another takes a look at the rest of the solar system. With a final chapter that goes out to the galaxy. The idea is to give you more perspective on our planet, and that these days, geology is not confined to this planet."
3,"Not the best of the Avengers, but still fun","This collection of the Avengers (issues #141-144 and #147-149) might best be remembered as the first appearance of Patsy Walker as Hellcat. It actually tells two separate Avengers stories. The first involves the Serpent Crown (why the hell would anyone wanna wear that thing, anyway?). The Avengers and Patsy Walker go to investigate Roxxon Oil, who have it in their possession. This soon leads to a battle with the Squadron Supreme, which sends our heroes into an alternate Earth. The remaining team ( Thor and Moondragon), get transported into the past by Immortus, where they find Hawkeye (who had been stuck in the past by Kang), and team-up with the heroes of the wild west (including Two-gun kid) to foil Kang's latest scheme."
2,Don't buy this unless you are a die hard Wrestling fan.,"Many will be dissapointed with this CD, the tunes are similar to the authentic Wrestlers entrance music, but are really not nearly as good. Contains two good tunes; one is Hulk Hogan's entrance music and the other being a rendition of Mankind's original entrance music. Other tracks are poor and added speach does not improve the quality of the CD, however die hard fans will no doubt purchase this CD if for no other reason other than to have it as part of their collection of wrestling memorabilia."
2,missing parts and wrong picture.,"okay, this thing works great but it was missing 6"" extension. Also, handle on magnet is plastic instead of wood."
5,Great Safe Product,"It isn't often I write to brag on a product, but I have the GT 2000 43"" System I use on my table saw. I also have two Spare GT 2000 Which I use on by band saw and they really work great! I've tried a number of products, including some homemade ones, but the Grip-Tite is the best I've used. Using the product while ripping makes me feel much more safe and confident and the set-up is really easy and quick. Thanks for a great product!"
5,toothpicks,"I have read all previous reviews of this Dave Mason Classic, (I to own the Marble vinyl) and can only say I have turned on many a friend to this great recording. Dave lent much to Traffic's 2nd and here on his own proves he is truly gifted. Enjoy folks-don't let this one go unlistened to . Just give the old stuff a listen, long live Rock and all that jazz."
4,Still a Great Listen,"I remember when this came out on vinyl and a friend of mine loaned it to me and said that ""this is like a Sargent Peppers"". He honestly felt that it was that important. I don't know if I would go that far, but the consistency of the writing and the level of muscianship is undisputable. I played the heck out of it back in the day and so I recently bought in on CD. It still holds up and is a friendly return to solid songwriting and thoughtfully constructed arrangements. One song flows into another in a seamless fashion and it gives you a good feeling to take with you, and that is what good music should do."
5,Fine guitar,"I used to spend many a romantic hour with my first wife by the fire in the living room listening to Dave Mason. The track called Look at Look at Me, has one very fine guitar solo in it which I saw him perform at the now defunct Boston Garden back in 1976. Fantastic!"
5,Alone Together...Among my top 5 favorite albums ever!,"I have loved this album for 30 years. Can it be that long? Now that I purchased it on CD I listen to it in the car and at work. I cannot get enough of it. Sad and Deep as You still brings tears. It is haunting. Every song is great..usually with a CD I will skip songs to get to the ""good ones"", but never on this one."
5,Excellent Resource!,"There are so many children's books on the market today that it is difficult to know where to begin when looking for books dealing with particular subjects. This is an excellent resource to help you find just the right book to incorporate into your lessons. The authors have reviewed many books, summarized them, and brought out different values and subjects that can be taught using each one. It is very helpful for anyone who works with children."
1,Wash But Not Dry,This Kit although it works is quite pricey for what you get. Basically it's a paintstick tube in which you draw your soapy water up and push out while scrubbing your car. The wash end of this doesn't do as well as a nice soft brush dipped in a bucket. The squeegy to dry the car with doesn't lay flat enough to evenly take the water off. 2 thumbs down for this kit.
4,Really great bang for your buck,"This was a pretty great deal. Free shipping too? Can't beat it. The only thing I didn't like is that the lip that borders the top of the locker. It is also made of wood. But really great, looks cute, and beats Ikea's price by almost half. Plus, it only took about 25 minutes to put together. Definitely worth your while."
4,My son loves this!,"My 4 year old son loves his ""Secret"" locker. It does not lock but he feels like he can keep personal things inside away from his little brother. This was easy to put together. I would but this again."
3,Not bad for the money,It took a while to put together but wasn't difficult. The white packing foam sticks to the blue paint and I still haven't been able to remove all of the white residue without removing paint. It's a good size for my son's bedside table.
5,"Ornament Display Stand For Objects Up To 8-1/2"" Tall (Set Of 5)","Ornament Display Stand For Objects Up To 8-1/2"" Tall (Set Of 5) I like them to hang my angels on. Great value."
4,"Terrific, but not everything I'd hoped for","I agree with the previous reviews that this recording beautifully reveals many wonderful details in the orchestration that I'd never heard before, particularly in the wind section. But in pursuit of that admirable goal, Stromberg begins to lose one of the score's most magical features: its unabashed romance and exhilarating brio. I can't find one place in this recording where Stromberg allows the strings to truly _glow_ the way they do throughout most of the original soundtrack. And his tempos, while never plodding, are occasionally too safe - the waltz for the Sherwood feast should feel like the raucous party we see on screen, not a polite symphonic affair. For fans of the score, this recording is an essential addition to the original soundtrack, but certainly not a replacement for it."
5,"Great muisc, less than stellar presentation by Amazon","Fabulous Korngold music, beautifully played, and exceptionally well recorded. BUT... Yes, if you look hard enough you will read on this page that this is a CDR, burned on demand. I buy many releases from ArkivMusic this way, and I have never been disapointed. What bothers me about this product is that we are not told that the original liner notes are not included, and that the packaging looks like it was done on someone's laptop. So, am I unhappy? Not really. It's a marvelous recording, the price is right, but I would have preferred buying the original Marco Polo used-- rather than this plain jane set. But it's the music that counts, thats why all five stars are lit.Addendum: There is a tiny interruption of audio between track numbers--- There shouldn't be any. This is sloppy work on the part of whoever is burning these. It' still not enough to make me send this back, but I am disappointed."
2,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"This 1938 ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" soundtrack IS a fantastic, upgraded score, by William Stromberg & Co.! However, what I received is NOT the original Marco Polo CD!! It's a ""NAXOS RECORDS"" copy cd......so just beware, when ordering.....especially with THIS cover on the cd! Just FYI, any Naxos cd is not going to be as good as the original! They NEVER include a copy of the original booklet, or liner notes, that come with the original Marco Polo cds!! Look for the ""ORIGINAL"" Marco Polo cd release of this...if you can find it! Much more worth it..... It's very unfair to the Amazon shopper, when the ""product details"" don't more accurately, truly describe precisely what the shopper will be receiving...."
4,"well, for all Adventures of Robin Hood lovers ... finally this is it!","Adventures of Robin Hood is the movie that made me want to be a filmmaker -- and more than anything, it was the music of this film that did it. From the time I was eleven, I have collected and searched for every bit of music I could find - be it radio recordings with Basil Rathbone narrating, or the ubiquitous Charles Gerhardt recordings. Here, finally is all the music from the movie - properly orchestrated, unedited - and beautifully recorded. It is obviously a work by people who loved this music as much or more than I. And I thank you for it."
1,not seamless and perfect,"I bought this product twice and the first time i bought them they worked well and shot smoothly but when i bought them the second time, the were really crappy and jammed every gun that i shot them out of (or at least tried to). It is a good price for the bbs, but its not worth a gamble every time you buy them and i think that if you tell your customers something, it should be done. these are going back to the seller and i will probably never buy these again."
1,Don't Buy This is false advertisment.,I never recieved the product that was advertised all i got was tiny small packages of multi colors that i did not want. Because it was christmas pressents I had to use the crap that was sent to me. I never recieved my product and believe that this is false advertisment. I will purchase any thing from this company again. Oh you only got 1 star because there was not and option for zero or less.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! SCAM,I bought this and realized the BBs where going pretty fast. It came with 10 bags full of BBs so I just thought each bag had 1000 BBs. I decided to count them with a speed loader and noticed each bag had 600 BBs. When I called Amazon they gave me the phone number of the people who sold them to me. When I called they were very rude and even denied they sold me this product. I just hung up on the douche bags and called Amazon customer service to request a return. I'd already used about 2 bags of BBs so they told me they'd only refund me for a a part of the $ if I returned them so I just decided to keep them. Please save yourselves the trouble and DO NOT order this shit.
4,Great BBs,"I like these bbs the only thing i don't like is that they have seems they are not very rough seems, to where the hurt you gun but you can tell there there. They shoot good and for spring guns they are perfect, in an AEG they would most likely cause gear problems or damage your hop-up.Austin"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!! TOTAL CRAP!!!!,"Urgent.. do not buy! Got these in and they weren't even spherical! Polished perfect grade is a total lie. I tried to shoot these in my AEG and they literally curved 10 feet in the first 8-10 yards. They will screw up your gun and you will be throwing 10 bucks (counting shipping)completely down the drain. It honestly looked like someone took two half spheres and glued them together a millimeter off center! By the way, anyone who actually gave a good review on these clearly didn't buy them."
3,CONSISTENT QUALITY BUT TOO BRIGHT,"being new to airsoft the one thing I can say is "" What a mess"" they sell you these bright fluorescent bb's to make them easier to find and re-use. I don't know anyone who takes the time to recover their ammo.I will buy Cammo Ammo in the future as it dosen't show on the lawn as conspicuosly."
1,im not liking it already,i just purchased my bbs 3 days ago and still the order has not be processedim not liking this alreadyit probably worth the money but the waiting just for processing the order is a pain i can imagine what its like when it comes to shipping
5,Real good,"Well I got this for $7 and like they said, it comes in any color they want to send (I got red) but that aint a problem. they come in two bags of 5000 BBs. They are really nice and polished. The only thing that is kind of bad is that there are little chunks of plastic inside the bag. some are little cylinders and some are just chinks. U really got to pick em out coz the might really jam your gun (especially if you have a wind up mag and thayll get stuck) I use em in my cyma 028 ak and they work just fine.Overall great bu I just hate the chunks!"
4,Cheap and accurate,This ammo is very accurate and a very good price. Only biodegradable ammo is getting 5 stars from me though.
5,great product.,I purchased these as a Christmas gift. I'm sure they will love them and they will work just fine. They came and 10 individually packed bags of a Thousand count.
3,Item ok,"Item as expected, although a different color (orange) and in ten little plastic bag packages. Shoot just fine from my pellet air pistol."
5,Not just a list of tanks.,"Russian Tanks 1900-1970 is not just another book listing tanks and armoured vehicles. The first chapter of the book starts with concepts that Russia was trying to develop before Revolution. The next six chapters deal with the formation of the tank industry, how real warfare forced the tanks to evolve to meet realistic needs, and tanks of the Nuclear Age.The second part of the book is made up of five chapters that DO list and give details about Light Tanks, Heavy Tanks, Self-Propelled Weapons and so on.The first part of the book is the best part. Watching how tanks, based totally on theory and simple ideas, were replaced by new and more effective tanks as the conflicts with Finland and Germany forced the Russians to rethink their designs is pure delight."
3,Frustrating and disappointing,"I recall appreciating The Society of Mind. But in this new book, his best answer to the Mystery of Experience is, ""experiencing something like a color seems simple but is actually complicated"". His main answer to the mega-Mystery of the Experience of Self-Awareness is, ""consciousness is a suitcase term that we use to refer to many different things"". It is almost like he is pretending to not experience these mysteries himself, so that he does not have to seriously engage the question of how/why our brain/minds do these things, and under what conditions other machines might. So frustrating that it makes the book hard to read -- it might have been better to skip over these matters more, if he can't deal with them more usefully."
1,BLAH....................,I FORCED MYSELF TO STAY WITH THIS BOOK TO ABOUT ONE THIRD OF IT.THIS BOOK IS A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. DON'T EVEN BE TEMPTED.GENE ADDINGTON
5,Essential,"Marvin Minksy's follow-up to Society of Mind (SOM) is a more legato paraphrasing of some of the ideas in SOM. As a whole, it may not be the most incredible read, but each sentence or idea in itself is profound. After reading this book, many other books seem flowery, fluffy, and self-important. True (as others have noted) the title is a little misleading, but Marvin's ideas and concepts like panalogies, levels of thinking, imprimers, etc. are solid platforms for the things that humans experience but often don't know how to think about. Moreover, the concepts are general enough to apply to all phenomena of human action, behavior and thought, but succinct enough to be considered rules and logic that will hopefully serve AI coders well in the future..."
4,Society of Mind II,"A good book with interesting ideas. However, there was a fair ammount of rehash from his other book (Society of Mind), there was alot of conjecture with not much expereimentally backed up theory, and of course no sourcecode!"
2,I am not its target audience,"I put this book on the shelf last night about 2/3 done, it will not be finished. I have a back ground in controls engineering and physics simulation, and much of what the author talks about is very similar to these subjects (feedback-control, gain schedualling, non-linear systems, constrained optimization, multi agent interactions etc) yet there is absolutely no use of this body of knowledge. Also the 'style' used in the presented flow diagrams is pain full.From the word 'machine' in the title I had expected a book with at least a hint of pseudo code or math but got none. I think if you have 'cut metal' on anything related to making a computer do anything that a human can do you will not enjoy this book."
3,"Decent film, awful DVD","This is a moderately entertaining late work from John Frankenheimer. The basic premise - a young journalist writes a novel about the Red Brigade in 1970's Italy, only to have it stolen and mistaken for the truth, causing him and his friends to be hunted for murder - is strong. The film itself is hampered by an obviously low budget and a lackluster leading man, though Stone and Golino are quite good. Even with schlocky stuff like this, Frankenheimer's talent with the camera and his actors shines through.The DVD, however, is a complete disaster. Many scenes are in Italian, but Sony has left off the original subtitles, as another reviewer mentioned. Scenes going on for five minutes at a stretch become incomprehensible. In addition, though the case says the film is in 1.66:1 widescreen, it is actually fullscreen.The film is not a masterpiece by any means, but it deserved better treatment than this."
5,Great music to move and groove to!,"This CD is a great collection of line dance music. Every song gets better than the one you just listened to. I play it daily! It's been some time now but I saw The Moody Brothers ""in concert"" in Bristol. Hope they come back to England some day!"
4,Good but not Great,"This was a good book with a so so begining. Too much about how Bates got into the situation he was in, was left out. Where did he get a ship that could travel that far?"
2,Outdated Ideas,"Way too outdated to be helpful! This book is almost 18 years old and the concepts it suggested for the 90's are not workable for the 21st century.There are some of the older program books that still have concepts that are helpful and serve as ""classic worksite books"", but this is not one of them. This book was initally written for non-worksite professional that needed to initiate a wellness program. There are now many free or low cost books and materials to help human resource or benefit types design and delivery wellness programs that will ""work""!"
3,Not what I was expecting,"Dont get me wrong, the lights are nice.. Just not what I was expecting. I wanted my parking lights to be brighter than the stock set of bulds. These were not. They are no brighter than the stock lights when the turn signal is not on. They are a little deeper orange than the stock one and are somewhat brighter when the turn signal is on."
1,TOTAL Waste of Money in my Application,"I bought these for my rear Stop lights thinking they would be brighter (and therefor safer). They are no better at all than the Stock 2 dollar sylvania bulbs they replaced, when used for Stop and Running lights in the rear. I would have returned them if possible, but no way to re-package them."
4,The Look,"I like the look of blue instead of orange in my headlight assembly. These lights don't appear any brighter than stock, just blue when off, orange when on."
4,Excellent,I own both this set and the one on WW 2 Bombers and I thought both sets were excellent. I saw the original programming on the Military Channel when it was first broadcast and I thought it was very well done. Don't undertsand the negative comments below. Disagree completely. I also have a lot of WW II documentaries and I consider these in the top 10%.Richard
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,ONE OF THE WORST DOCUMENTARIES I HAVE EVER PURCHASED AND I OWN DOZENS. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
4,Good overview book,"We recently purchased a 1934 Spanish Eclectic that needs not only restoration of it's former architectural integrity, but an addition to make the home work for us. This book was a good choice to provide us with a photographic ""library"" of Spanish-style homes to reference. I do wish there had been more devotion to the ""casitas"" section of middle-class homes and less to buildings dedicated to government or business; and perhaps more photographs of interiors. But it's still a great find and a wonderful addition for anyone who collects either books on architecture in general or on California architecture specifically."
2,Try Expanding Your Horizons,"This book is great....if you're interested in this style in California.The authors almost completely glitz over the architectural contributions of buildings in Texas and Florida. For example, did they know that there is an air force base (Randolf) in Texas built in the red tile style? Apparently not.California has a lot to offer, but this book ignores the rich and abundant examples TX & FL have ...so 2 stars."
5,Excellent!,Service is good. Condition is mind blowing. Better and Better price than ever seen. Every thing is perfect. Sounds great. i will surely going to buy again.
3,Look at the Cover!,"Those guys on the cover actually wrote this book! What a bunch of geeks.., er I mean, professionals. When you have to know this kind of stuff, these are the kind of people you need to ask. I expect to be mining information from this book for years to come."
2,Too many authors and poor delivery,"This book gets off to a decent start, describing the fundamentals, but the writing style is awkward throughout; it's obvious some authors were more skilled writers, but overall I found the writing style so poor it was a major distraction for me. I had come to expect high quality from Wrox, after reading two extremely well written books by Rod Johnson: Spring Framework and J2EE without EJB, but this fell short.This was my first introduction to C#/.NET world, coming from the land of Java and open-source. I was trying to stay as much as possible in Java-land, using NAnt instead of Visual Studio and sticking to the API/SDK. In completing my project I ended up relying much more on Google and MSDN, but I did get a good handle on the fundamentals from this book."
2,Poor quality control,"I don't think this book deserves a 5 star rating. The quality of material between the chapters are too uneven. Some concepts are explained well in some chapters but not in others.The book should have included more information about the different ways of writing methods, arrays, data access codes..etc. I get the impression that some of the authors are not 100% clear about the subjects they are writing about."
5,Awesome Reference Book on C# 2.0,This is an incredible reference with a ton of great sample code to help you get the most out of the latest version of C#. I highly recommend it!
1,Too much comment,I dont feel very well studying with this book because they write a line of code of example an to explain it they write 2 pages. Too much bla bla bla which make it very difficult to study and read.
