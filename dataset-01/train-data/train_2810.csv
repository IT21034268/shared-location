5,"A unique, uncompromising talent--VIVA AMY!!","Amy Winehouse shows in this luscious DVD that she is the real deal. The best singer/songwriter to come along in ages, and a charming, beautiful performer. What more could one ask? She did NOT appear ""drunk"" to me--just a bit shy, insecure, and pleasantly tipsy. Whatever gets you though the show, Amy! She's got the ""wow factor"" so many manufactured, lip syncing, cookie cutter pop stars lack. This doll has talent to spare. And her band is the bomb. As for the two back-up singers/dancers--phenomenal! Where do these guys find the energy to sing and dance like that for an entire show? This DVD showcases a rare talent--so ignore the tabloid trash and enjoy a genuine star for a change."
5,Amy Winehouse - Live,"This live concert has the best songs from both of her albumns. The jazzy, soulful mix in her voice never disappoints. The band is incredible - tight base lines, and the horn and saxophone section support Amy's unique style and voice at every turn. I saw the concert first on MSN and began to search for a DVD right away. This DVD is a must for anyone that loves music."
5,Amy was awesome!,"I bought the Blu Ray version, which has two Amy concerts. One is the original I Told You I Was Trouble concert and the other is from Porchester Hall (BBC One Sessions). I like the Porchester's concert. Amy's vocals are slurry on the original and she is a little more focused on the Porchester's. My favorite song she did was Know You Now. I'm a big Amy fan and I love how she talks to the audience and somewhat interacts with them. On the Shepherd's Bush Empire concert (original) she still interacts, but I don't know what it is about that one. I barely have the urge to watch that one. I still recommend the DVD/Blu-Ray disc its Amy at her best.RIP QUEEN WINEHOUSE"
4,Why are they always better before rehab?,"If you're a Winehouse, this is it. I like her style. Her band is goood, and the show was very good. I like it."
5,FAST service and product in PERFECT condition. Thanks,I cannot get enough of Amy Winehouse. Thank you for sending this DVD so quickly. It is a wonderful DVD. I absolutely LOVE Amy's brutely honest ways.It would be nice if everyone would be so honest.
2,Too sad to watch,"Maybe I can get through this if I just put it on the tv, leave the room and get busy while listening. Watching it is too painful. She is drunk, continues to drink and get more drunk throughout the show. Breaks my heart. I love her music, but am old enough to be her mother and I can't help but watch with sadness. I realize I may just be too old, and young peeps enjoy this kind of performance, but I know I will never be able to sit and watch it. Will maybe sell on Ebay and just continue to enjoy her music, hope that she gets it together soon. She reminds me of Billie Holiday, and I even wonder at times if she is her reincarnated soul...back here to ""get it right"" but so far not succeeding. Listen to her tunes. There are a few especially on the Frank Album (one in particular) where you would swear it was Billie if you didn't know."
2,I have to agree: TOO SAD,"Based on ""Frank"" and ""Back to Black,"" I think Amy Winehouse is the most talented, interesting, and entertaining artist to come along in at least 30 years; so I went ahead and ordered this DVD even after reading the review by a fan of my age and gender who said it was too sad to watch. However, it really is painful to watch, and I doubt I will watch it again. Unfortunately, we can only wait and hope and pray that Amy will get healthy and confident and someday be able to give us live performances that live up to those two albums. I would advise fans to stick with those CDs and not waste their money on this sad DVD."
2,Pathetic and sad,"I love Amy Winehouse's music. However, in this particular show, she was totally out of this planet. I don't know if she was completely drunk or drugged or both, but she can't pronounce any word properly, let alone sing. She MUMBLES the whole show, and even for a native it's really hard to make out any word she is saying. SAD."
3,Wasted,"I was very excited to get this DVD until the first song. Amy Winehouse is loaded from he moment she steps on stage. While yes she is a great artist and she has a good band, she gives a lackluster performance because of her condition. At least hold it together for a DVD recording... How addicted is she?"
2,SAD,"I love Amy Winehouse's music. However, in this particular show, she was totally out of this planet. I don't know if she was completely drunk or drugged or both, but she can't pronounce any word properly, let alone sing. She MUMBLES the whole show, and even for a native it's really hard to make out any word she is saying. SAD."
1,Sloppy !,"Amy didn't do justice to either her material or her audience.Thought I'd enjoy seeing/hearing her perform the hits/strong vocals; Instead, I got a sloppy performance from someone who seemed disinterested - I couldn't understand the lyrics or the spoken parts.Did she even know/care that she was being taped?Ugh !"
1,Couldnt watch it.,I couldnt watch this one all the way through. Her voice was off as if she was high.
4,A jazz trio in good spirits.,"This 1959 studio session finds the former Miles Davis rhythm section in good form, with Evans leading a solid set of tunes. Evans is looser and less brooding than he would be on many later works. The highlight however, is Philly Joe Jones on drums - the perfect combination of class and flair. Paul Chambers (Mr. PC) is solid as ever. Its hard to understand the inclusion of the last track - from a different date with different players. Though the tune is well done, its obviously out of place."
4,Kako and his cohorts really cooks,I love the melange of instruments used to convey the message and it was well received. I did not care for the vocals but Kako really cooks.
4,"Arthur my dear, you have something here","I thought this collection of songs were very enjoyable to listen to. It is refreashing to hear that they have no words in them, which I think is an oppition that is frequently overlooked by todays artists."
5,Temperature Controlled Soldering Iron System,Well worth the price tag. The best iron for any electronics board work. No adjustments to worry about. Buy a low cost 700 degree tip and it keeps it at 700 degrees so that the solder tinning doesn't boil away every few seconds. Apply solder and more power is automatically fed into the heating element to maintain solder flow. Better than the TC (thermocouple types) because the tips cost one tenth of the price. You can have 3 or 4 tips for any purpose: 1/16 inch for fine work; 1/8 inch for normal work; etc. System is grounded to protect components from static charges.
3,"Great unit, but dated design; no temperture control","I have two of these when they sold for $95. They were US made at the time (don't know about now) and they were a far cry from a outdated 'soldering pencil' where the temperature varied according to how much the pencil was in contact with the work.You can vary the temperature of the tip, but only by changing the tip itself which is inconvenient. For around the same price (and less for no name Chinese imports) you can get a station with temperature control and digital readout which is why I gave it only three stars.Never had any problem with either. I even picked up a replacement cord for the hand unit to extend the reach of the pencil."
4,Comfortable socks,"I really like these socks. They're soft on the inside and fit comfortably around the ankle. For some reason, the green pair felt a little smaller than the other two pairs in the package. I also like the different texture of the material on top of the foot -- it makes the socks more breathable. There is decent cushioning on the bottom of the socks and the toe seams are not bulky."
4,Adidas Women's quarter Sock,"I perchased and returned these socks a number of times. They are great, but some pairs were smaller than others. Very annoying! So, I kept ordering and returning until I had three pairs the same size.Adidas Womens 6-Pack Quarter Socks"
5,Come See,"Awesome-Awesome photography. Includes basic history of various relevant automakers and models. i scored this book used very cheap and absolutely love it for the full-page pictures alone, which are enhanced by the extra-large size of the book itself. Not much technical data, in case that is for what you are looking."
3,only because of one really good song!,"this album was worth it for track 2 -I LOVE that track!!...otherwise, this was the Butthole music that I didn't really go for (unlike 'Psychic Powerless...' which kicks all!)I usually go for reviewing songs, rather than whole albums, because then people can check my other reviews and see if they agree with my choice of favs, and go from there...I guess..."
3,Wow this thing is hot,I was very pleased with the rapid shipment and expeditious delivery of this item although upon my first use of the tool after reading the instructions on the back of the packing material. I was turned off to its use due to the fact that it was getting extremely hot to the touch and it is causing me some concern. As far as vibration goes I was pleased with the performance of the reciprocating tool and did not find it to be very difficult to do even tight areas with. I would recommend this to a friend but I would also recommend that before use they lubricate the shaft even if it says it has been done prior to shipping. One recommendation I would give to the manufacturer is to include the greasing instructions as well as a better set of detailed instructions for use. I was lucky and had already seen some of these first hand but others who are not familiar with the tools may find themselves burning the tool up due to expectation of manufacture.
4,Lots of features for the price,"We ordered four of these to add to an emergency ""go-pack"" for each family member.Undeniably, the fact that these are powered via the sun or hand-crank is a plus for us. The flashlight/lantern feature is nice, as is the radio with an antenna (something a lot of self-powered radios seem to lack). The siren is not loud at all and therefore mostly useless. It's too bad this doesn't have a cell phone charger on it (though it would be almost impossible to always have the right attachments anyway, given how new cell phones come out every month, it seems).For the purposes of an emergency kit, these are great, except for the weak siren. We plan to override this problem with pealess whistles :)"
1,Totally worthless,"No disrespect meant to the 4-star reviewer, but maybe he/she got lucky and didn't 'wind-up' with the (either) defective or hunk-of-junk item I got stuck with. It neither holds a charge after 8 hours of solar charging, nor 'cranking your guts out' for 3+ minutes. In both those instances, the flashlight/lantern LED's only illuminated (weakly) for less than a minute. The only way I could get even an hour's worth of light from this product was to charge it (...which I did first as per the instructions), with the included AC/DC charger. I've never purchased a more worthless product than this item...and believe me, I've come across some real losers. But this one takes the prize as the worst."
4,"All-star band, classic tunes","If you like the Sinatra songbook, and you like modern post-bop jazz, this is the album for you. This band delivers the goods. The lineup:Per Goldschmidt - baritone saxTom Harrell - trumpetNiels Lan Doky - pianoNiels-Henning Orsted Pedersen - bassAlvin Queen - drumsHighlights of the album for me are the exuberant ""Come Fly With Me"" and Tom 'Ballad-Master' Harrell with Goldschmidt on the poignant ""A Man Alone""."
3,waiting further revelations,"span of views not so greatand clarity of photos also not too goodolder book before google earth etcnazca yet to be decoded , its there but not yetexplained ....ME source ? , as via sumerian writings 2,000 bc in peruetc"
5,Have tried a lot of different headsets for use with cell phone. This one works best for me.,"I've tried various brands (Jabra, Platronics, Motorola, other stuff) and this particular Plantronics model seems to me to be superior to all I have tried. Best sound quality for both me and the one listening on the other end. This is the only headset that I have ever used (and I've used it a lot) where the another person at the other end (a friend usually is the one who will tell you these things, not an acquaintance) where others have not told me it's hard to hear me or that my voice sounds odd in this way or that. Maybe someday the Bluetooth stuff will sound as good as this does. For now, I'm sticking with the cord. (Works great on cordless phones in the home, too.)"
4,Better than holding the handset,Sound is quite good. Comfortable and much more convenient when spending long minutes on hold.
3,"OK, but quality reflects the price.","I've gotten so used to using a headset with my iPhone that I wanted one for my office phone. With my iPhone, I went with the Boom headset and haven't regretted it. I thought I might save some money and bought this Plantronics unit.End result? The Plantronics headset is so-so. Maybe I've gotten spoiled by the quality and comfort of the Boom, but this Plantronics headset doesn't measure up. The difference in quality is apparent, even more so over time. The wiring is thinner and more fragile and doesn't have flexible reinforcements at critical stress points. The wire clip is about the size of a clothes-pin! Certainly not inconspicuous. Finally, it lacks an easy to use mute and/or volume control.All-in-all, it's OK but I wouldn't pay more than $20 for it."
2,could not connect,Somehow my phone would not automatically connect with it even though my phone (a motorola v551) had it's bluetooth powered on and the devices had been paired successfully previously. I don't know if the problem was only with my phone though..
3,Not that it is Bad,This is an ok book. But my sons who love books didn't particularly love this one. The CD is enjoyable of course. His music is great. So this is a nice little set. But I wish for us I had spent the money on a actual CD and so got more than I think 5 songs and a book that really isn't read much. I'm just adding my opinion because this is a regret purchase for me and yet the reviews are all terrific. Not a bad item; just not maybe worth the price to me.
5,cedar block,"keeps the moths away. no fuss, no muss. pleasure to do business with. arrived on time as indicated. works well. no complaints to date."
3,Spend a little more money for more comfortable one,"Cyber Acoustics AC-851B USB Stereo Headset OEMI would spend $7-$10 more for a better unit. Trouble is, it's hard to know which are better. This one should be adequate, but my immediate impression was NOT ""wow, this is great,"" but rather, ""this is okay and will do for the price."" I don't know how long it will last as I just bought it.PROS:I have just plugged this in, and it seems to work fine.1. The microphone part is adjustable which is good.2. There is a mute and volume control on the cord and a led on light alsoCONS:The plastic head piece seems to narrow for my head (5'6"" female); It is adjustable longer but not wider, so it seems a little tight, which should probably be good for an hour class but not longer2. The earpads might be better if rounder: they too are tall but not wide, and not 100% wonderful on my ear."
2,Good - but didn't last long enough.,"I bought a set of these headphones for my teenage daughter. The headset that came with some foreign language software had fallen apart and these were a replacement. After only 4 weeks - she was putting them on her head and one of the ear pieces just snapped apart! The wires were still intact, but they are basically not usable anymore. She really liked the sound and the noise cancelling features on them - it's too bad they just didn't last long enough to make the purchase worthwhile."
5,Great Headset for Rosetta,Bought this for Rosetta stone and think it's better than the product that comes with it. Seller was quick and product came as promised. Much Appreciated
3,Works for computer,"I bought this headset thinking that i could use it for the PS2, well if you are doing it for the same reason then dont because it doesn't work for the ps2. it works great on the computer though."
3,Mike falls off,"USB stereo is very convenient, and the sound quality of the headphone is good. Unfortunately, the mike attachment tends to fall off when twisted. I judge the overall design good, but inferior mike mechanism."
1,Headset is trash.. Cannot get audio to go to headset from software like windows media player.,"I hate this piece of crap headset.. The instruction manual does not apply to this piece of crap headset, which I cannot get sound to go through. This product sucks. Their support on the web is terrible.. it says to watch headset videos without a link."
1,Arrived Broken,"WOULD NOT SUGGEST THESE. I had a pair of these from walmart that was similar to these but not a usb, arrived broken straight out of the box i plugged it in once and it worked then wouldent turn on when i plugged it in computer wouldn't recognize it anything. If you can afford it i would suggest getting theRazer Carcharias Gaming Headset (Black)that's what I went with I also wrote a review on them very good quality style and almost everything you could imagine in a dream set."
1,If only...,"I'd love to give a full review of the usability and quality of the product. Unfortunately, the durability of the headphones (or lack thereof) prevented me from doing so. Upon stretching the headphones after first taking them out of the box, the band broke near one of the earpieces and rendered the headphones useless. I hope others have better luck with them, but I ended up buying a different brand instead; I didn't want to risk another break!"
1,oh no,"i loved Brenda Kahn's first record with it's spikey sarcastic approach to urban folk rock...but somewhere along the way, she got a bit too pretentious for my tastes. Destination Anywhere is aimless and pointless and just sounds as lost and hopeless as the title implies. it's a shame because she showed so much talent on the Epiphany In Brooklyn album. but sadly, not much here to praise."
4,A Good Start,"With this just being their debut effort, Kid Sampson are suprisingly Good! The drummer Mike Sullivan is perhaps the most gifted drummer in music today."
1,"Product may be a good one, but it doesn't fit my bed frame.","I have a bed that's about 18 years old. The matress is that old, the box spring is that old and the frame - guess how old that is. The same 18 years old. When I moved from my last residence, one of the clamps was lost in the shuffle. It had to be replaced. I bought this item believing it would make a useful replacement for the lost one.Unfortunately, try as I might, I simply could not get the clamp to fit the horizontal rails. I even called the manufacturer and try as THEY might, it just didn't work. We came to the conclusion that my 18-year-old frame was just too big, and the clamp too small. No.... there is NO Goldilocks in this story - just an unhappy ending.Martin Z."
5,This will help you be an expert at Captivate,"I love the way this person writes a tech manual. It's a workbook so you slowly learn how to use the product and learn how to use more and more features. His writing style is consistent, his choice of bolding makes things easier, and he makes learning so easy that I've adapted his writing style when I do my own tech writing."
3,Could be a great book,"Captivate is a very useful elearning, simulation/demo program that lets you do a multitude of things. This book touches on many of those topics. I work for an instructional team that works with Captivate students and we find this book to be very boring. The sample files are drab and while some of the files on the CD rom in the back of the book are useful, many of the files are bit silly - such as the sound bytes - not real world enough. It does have a decent section in the front that briefly discusses script writing with accompanied files.I don't agree with some of the author's opinions and the choice of a sans-serif font throughout the book - makes it a difficult read.The tech support from Iconlogic has been good. I would like to do plenty of business with this company, but would like to see a better organized book that I can easily use in class.Overall, you won't lose by buying this book. The book and student files could be a bit more interesting."
5,Carlos Puebla gets my vote!,"'A music fan from Washington, DC USA' should realise that not everyone shares the American paranoid view of Cuba. If you think this is good, then listen to the CDs of Carlos Puebla's revolutionary music. Americans, listen and try to understand, if you are big enough."
5,Thailand took the words right out of my mouth,This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. I first watched this movie back when I was around 15 (I'm 30 now) and I have watched it at least once a year since. Christopher Reve and Jane Seymour are incredible.
5,Excellent Story,"This film grabs your attention from begining to end. Great acting and made at a excellent location,Mackinaw Island, Michigan."
5,The Greatest Love Story Of All Time A Must That Everyone See,"This movie is The Best love story movie ever made. It is only second to ""The Wizard Of Oz"" . Christopher Reeves and Jane Seymore portray the most moving charaters that ever hit the screen. Have a box of Kleenex tissues as there will NOT be a dry eye in the house. If this movie does NOT touch your heart, nothing ever will and you need to make an appointment with your doctor to see if you have a heart. A must to see 100 times. END"
5,My all time favorite movie!,This movie is a classic in my opinion. I've probably watched it at least 50 times. I bought this as a gift & they LOVED it!
5,Somewhere in Time,"""Somewhere In Time"" what a love story. I think Jane Seymore and Christopher Reeves did a very good job. The music was beautiful and enhanced the acting. I love this movie. Glad to have, Somewhere In Time, in my collection of the best (in my opinion)"
5,I love it,Very happy with purchase! I love this movie! In my opinion this is one of the best movies Christopher Reeves & Jane Seymour did.
4,A classic,"This is one of those classic love stories with a twist of time travel. It's an older movie, so the cinematography leaves a little to be desired."
4,Sneaks into your heart,"I first saw this movie by accident on TV. It was late one night when I happened upon it and it hooked me. It can come across as cheesy but it so isn't. I think if not for the tremendous acting and chemistry of Reeves and Seymour, the movie would not have been as strong. The story is timeless (no pun intended) and man it makes you wish it was possible. The way he looks at her and the way he kisses her.....holy hell lol. It changes you and makes you really think about life, love and chance. And it is funny too. Reeves gives his character such heart and you are cheering for him through it all. I am so glad I bought the DVD so I can watch it whenever I wish. So worth the money. Heck the hour documentary on the making of the movie is worth the money of the DVD. IT WAS AWESOME!!!"
5,Somewhere in Time,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Very romantic. Wonderful actors filmed just before their prime. Christopher Plummer, Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeves."
5,One of the greatest love stories ever...,"I saw this movie the first time when it first came out about 20 years ago. I never forgot it and how it made me feel - such deep passion and heart wrenching love. I had a bad copy of it on VHS so I was thrilled when I found out that this DVD was coming out. I bought it immediately and watched it over and over. Then I watched the special features and just fell in love with the movie all over again. It was awesome seeing the characters describe what they felt making the movie, the little bits of trivia, etc. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good love story."
3,"The music is great, but...","The soundtrack of this movie is very good including its version of the ""18th Variation on a Theme from A Raphsody of Paginni"" by Rachmaninoff. However, casting Christopher Reeves opposite Jayne Seymour is a real mistake. Specifically, Seymour can act; Reeves cannot.This story, like all time-travel stories, includes the unavoidable time paradox that, in the end, requires thinking people to relegate it to the same trash-heap with cotton candy, snow cones, copies of ""Love Story"" and other cloying materials.This movie also happens, in my opinion, to be the chick flick to end all chick flicks."
2,"Good movie, poor DVD quality","For those of you like me that are sticklers on anamorphic widescreen, do NOT buy this DVD. It is the old ""letterbox"" format, which means you will have a small picture on any wide screen tv, with black bars all the way around. Zooming in on this, of course, results in a very poor picture quality. And they call this a ""Collector's Edition"" -- what a joke. I only gave it 2 stars instead of one because I like the movie so much.When will we get a true widescreen version, or better yet, blu-ray? Wake up, Paramount!"
5,Somewhere in Time,This is such a unique story; it is a love story but that is not all. It is a mystery unlike any other. It is a visually beautiful movie as well. You will want to watch it more than once!
5,Great video,"We made a trip to Machinac Island. The night before we watched the video ""Somewhere in Time"". After being on the island I really wanted to get the video and we got it at Amazon for a fraction of the cost we would have had to pay there."
3,Somewhere in Time,"This video is entertaining, although the storyline is abit unbelievable. Good video, however, for Christopher Reeve fans who would enjoy seeing him in a sentimental film"
5,SOMEWHERE IN TIME,"IF YOU LIKE TO BE LEAD INTO PURE ROMANCE WITHOUT ALL THE FLUFF THIS IS THE ONE TO WATCHI HAD TO HUNT IT DOWN BEFORE COMPUTERS HELPED US OUT AND ALLWAYS HAVE A COPY ON HAND NOW IN ONE FORMAT OR ANOTHER, IT IS JUST BEAUTIFUL AND BOTH LEAD ACTORS ARE TRUELY MAGICAL IN THERE ROLES. SOME MAY FIND IT DATEDALTHOUGH A FRIEND SAT HER TWO [TYPICAL] TEENAGE DAUGHTERS DOWN TO IT RECENTLY AND ALLTHREE OF THEM ATE CHOCS AND PASSED THE TISSUES."
4,Reading the book matters,"I read the book a LONG time ago, and when I saw the movie back then I was disappointed because several details were changed, and back then I was a little hung up about things like that.Fast-forward (a cassette generation euphemism!) about 25 years, and having watched it again, I truly appreciate the movie more. The only problem is that I've lent the movie to three people, and they all had a little difficulty following the plot on the first run through. That being said, the movie is a romantic tragedy that touches your heart strings beautifully."
4,When Romance Meets the Metaphysical,"Immerse yourself in a romantic tale of epic proportions when the past, present, and future, fade together. Watch as a dreamy woman wills her ideal man (Christopher Reeve) from the future into her present life, without either of them truly understanding how it was possible for love to transcend time.There are great spiritual depths to this movie, so I recommend watching it a few times. It was directed by Stephen Simon, the creator of Spiritual Cinema Circle and director of What Dreams May Come, so if you're a fan of either of those then this will be right up your alley."
3,Slow,"Yes, this is an old movie. It barely cuts it for me. The romance is drawn out and there is only about 30 seconds of soundtrack played over and over and over again. The acting is marginal. The story is intriguing, but the ending is frustrating. Sure, it is an ""open"" ending, but for a movie of this genre?"
4,Somewhere in Time,"A beautiful love story, but I found it confusing. Was this love a figment of his imagination? Crossing time and skipping from one place to another in a movie or novel always seems to confuse me. I will look at it again to try to get more sense of what this movie is about."
1,It was so silly I laughed!,"Let me start by saying that my daughter and I love a good romance movie better than anything. Having said that we thought that this movie reeked! The whole premise of traveling back in time was executed very poorly. Also waiting for C.R. to think himself back in time was so drawn out and boring!!!! C.R'S character seemed so weak that I couldn't imagine being attracted to him. The romance scenes made me laugh because you just couldn't take C.R'S advances seriously, he seemed silly. I don't blame Jane Seymour or Chris Reeves for this. I think the screenplay for it was dreadful and the directing just as bad. If you want to watch something romantic watch ""Sense and Sensibility"" with Emma Thomson and Alan Rickman. Now there's a movie worth watching."
5,Truely Moving,"I read the book before watching the movie, the movie was a little different, with a few things left out. It was a very heart warming adaptation of the book by Richard Matheson. I found it odd that the day Christopher Reeve pasted away I had finished reading the book and watched the movie. It has become one of my favourite movies ever, of any genre. The cast is amazing, all the characters were wonderfully played, especially Reeves Collier character.A truely heartwarming, moving, lovley story."
5,it's a love story,"if you're a romantic of the time knows no barrier sort, this is a must. Great music too."
2,Choose a good book instead!,"The story is colorful with some beautiful music and scenes. But it is fanciful, slow and boring. Too bad! Granted, my criteria for movies is high. I prefer something with depth and value. This one is forgetable."
5,Somewhere in Time,This movie is a clasic. It is a movie that you could watch over and over. It has a fan group that meets yearly to discuss and meet fellow actors that were in the movie. I saw this movie when I was in highschool back in 1980 and I still love to watch this movie. It really makes you think and feel for the actors.
1,Get a Life!,"This has to be one of the all-time sappiest movies ever made! If the royalties help out Christopher Reeve, great -- otherwise...it's a waste of time! Does romance mean total fantasy? These folks need to get a life! A real one!"
3,Chick Flick,"...not that there's anything wrong with that! This truly is a romantic film, made especially for the gushy hearted cupid in all of us. It's filmed in gorgeous countryside, and Seymour and Reeve have just enough chemistry to make their attraction believeable. The story is corny and completely unrealistic, but endearing just the same. And yes, you will cry. It's got that kind of ending that you just can't help it...As an aside, it's quite nice to see Christopher Reeve on film, and it makes you feel for his tragic real life loss of mobility even more when you witness his commanding physique in this film. He had a screen presence that I believe his fans truly miss."
4,Good movie with a twist.,"This is a love story with a scientifical twist. I did not expect to like this movie but I did. Notice that the time travel relation is a loophole. The old lady tells him to go back to her so he travel back in time and do so but in order for that to happen he must been there previously otherwise she would never met him, in other words there is no beginning nor end to the timeloop, also the watch that she gives him was given to her by him which in turn was given to him by her and so on going in circles forever. Overall: VERY GOOD"
2,Sentimental romance,"My best friend, whose judgment is usually flawless, recommended this as her absolute favorite film. However, it did not work for me. In short, it's a love story with a cute premise, some interesting period scenes, and easy-on-the-eyes actors; while possibly a good film for a date, it didn't hold my attention."
1,Such lack of hope,"The movie indicates that if you lose someone you love, you should just die as soon as possible, and then you'll see them. For those of us who have lost someone, and choose to try and make a new life, this is maybe the worst movie in the world"
5,Somewhere in Time,"A timeless classic, Jane Seymour and Christopher Reeves are both so perfect for their roles in this beautiful love story. Everyone should see this movie at least once."
5,This is an awesome romantic movie.,I watched this movie after hearing a great recommendation on it. I was overwhelmed with tears and joy at the same time. This was such an awesomely romantic movie. I recommend buying this movie. I am purchasing it as well.
5,One of the Best,"Yes, it's a little corny. But if you can get past the going back in time, it is one of the most heart warming movies I have ever watched. Jane Seymour is what makes this movie great.The part where she is on stage and starts talking to Christoper Reeves will tear your heart out. The only reason I gave it five stars is, cause that's all the stars there are."
1,POOR RECORDING QUALITY,"Dissapointing! this is a great movie that my wife and I love so much, unfortunately, the recording process of this DVD is very poor, I believe it's a bootleg! my old VHS tape is clearer. It's cheap! but not worth it. Sorry, I have to return it."
5,My all time favorite movie.,"No other movie comes close to this one in capturing that eternal--magical-- unguarded moment between two lovers. If you cannot appreciate this movie, you have never really been in love, you've never really kissed someone you loved.Have you ever kissed, and in the midst of it you felt yourself being lifted, your feet are off the ground, you get that sense of being SUSPENDED, up in the clouds, gently, slowly spinning, all inside one kiss. Well, this movie is like that experience.If you want to be reminded of what that experience was like back then, watch this movie. If you want to know what it is like to truly LIVE, watch this movie."
5,The Power of Intent,"I did not see this movie when it was released in 1980. I was thirty one at the time, but thirty one years later I watched it 11/30/11. It came about as I was sharing a piano arrangement that I composed with a friend, they said it triggered a memory that it sounded like the music in ""Some Where in Time"". That was one of the reasons I wanted to watch the movie. I purchased the DVD also after reading the reviews on Amazon. This movie took my breath away. There were other comments that attempted to put the movie down (due to a lack of understanding)but the vibration and the intent behind this movie was powerful. I'm talking about a mindset. That's why it stands at the top of the list as a favorite for many. I believe it's important to keep an open mind. Who says time travel isn't possible? Ninety percent of the things that happen in life cannot be proven, but they exist. I personally believe in a love that transcends time."
5,Such a wonderful movie.,This reminds me of Romeo and Juliet but with time travel. I would recomend this movie to anyone who likes a sweet romance and classic movies.
4,Macinac Island must see,After visiting Macinac Island in Sept. this was a must see movie. I had never seen it but my husband remembered it and we enjoyed watching it together and remembering our fun time in the UP
5,My favorite,"I am not an avid movie watcher. Most I find too violent, too stupid, or too obscene. This movie captivated me from the first time I saw it. The musical score haunted me for days. For those of us lucky enough to have experienced such an all consuming passion in our lives, it brings back memories. For those searching, it gives a taste of what such a love can be. For those critics out there, they are heartless and there is probably no place in their hearts for such a love. The story and the characters simply draw you in if you allow them. This is an unforgettable piece of cinema. I hope there will be future generations of fans that will be drawn in to this film as well. The story is simple - a love that transcends time. I hope the future of this film is timeless as well."
4,A Good Romance,"If you are/were a fan of Christopher Reeves, you will enjoy this movie. It's a romance with mystery. Love eternal over the decades. The Future meets the past and the past wins. A good story with great acting."
5,GREAT movie,"This is one of those movies you have to watch a couple of times a year, A little science fiction for the guys, romance for the ladies. Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour deliver superb performances. it was filmed on mackinac is. whether you buy it or rent it ..WATCH it"
2,Somewhere in time,"I have always loved this movie but, this DVD is a poor copy of the original movie. The resolution and clarity of this DVD copy is bad. The brighter out door scenes are grainy,over exposed,and washed out."
4,Classic Romance,Perhapes one of my most favorite movies.Only complaint is that *ending*.However I love the cast in this movie.The background music and the costumes.So wonderful!
4,Forever My Love,"I'm not exactly a lover of period pieces, but as this movie went on it started to feel as though it was pulling me inside making me a part of it. Laughing when they laughed, crying when they cried. I didn't see the very beginning so the ending caught me off guard. Had I seen it from the start I would have figured it out. I believe that's what made it so enjoyable."
5,An Artful Masterpiece,Reeve and Seymour are a touching combination of perfection for this romance/time travel combo. It grabs fantasy as well as romance viewers in a classical combination. Certainly one of the best.
2,I was bored,"I bought this movie to watch during a car trip to Florida. Watching movies helps the ride go faster. This movie was very slow and I was bored and watching the road more than the movie. I bought it because of the high rating, but it was a waste of my time."
1,dvd unviewable,"The dvd was received on time and in good shape. Unfortunately, the dvd would not play in any dvd player. It does have the code 2,4PAL on it which I understand means it is for foreign county viewing. I would like it return it and get the same movie but for the USA. Please send me the address to return the DVD. Thank you so much for your help."
2,Time not binding.,"The time travel explanation of ""willing"" yourself to a different time period is very fascinating. Jane Seymour is as beautiful as ever. Christopher Reeves is very good as well. Sure, it's a love story but it's a different twist on this genre. It's simply not my type of movie."
1,Could have been better,"This movie has a good story if you like slow moving no action hard to follow movies. But for the rest of us I have seen better, much better. Also, for all of you who want to go to Mackinaw Island, there are NO CARS on the island, I realise that they brought cars on the island just for this movie but it totally ruins the historicalness and majesty of the island. I would recomend seeing another movie, not this."
3,Entertaining but...,"This movie is a poor man's Time and Again. This story was written after Time and Again and is a total ripoff of the story. Time and Again could not be made into a movie because the rights were owned by Robert Redford. Instead, Time and Again was made into a lousy musical and they made the movie Somwhere in Time. If you want to read a great book, get Time and Again and it's sequel."
5,Fabulous. Reeve and Seymour are magical. A must-see.,"This is a film I saw on the big screen first, and have seen it over and over on video. If you like to look back at the way things were, and have a magical experience, see Somewhere in Time. It is celebrating I believe it's 20th year anniversary this October. This movie is timeless with a wonderful musical score."
5,Love Story,A beautiful love story. I've watched this movie over and over. The costumes and setting are perfect.
5,I Guess My Secret Is Out,"I am an ever hopeful romantic. If you're reading this, then likely you are too. But don't fret, your secret's safe with me. This is the story (yes, soppy, sweet and sticky) of a young play write who meets and olde woman after one of his plays but cannot get her out of his head. This propels him on a a unique journey, worthy of an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" to find the woman of his dreams from another time. Amazing story but all in all it's the romance which captured me. Jane Seymour costars as the love interest and Christopher Reeve shows just how he can work outside of his Superman role when given half a chance. I was never a big fan of Seymour but always loved Reeve. The pairing is perfect and the cast all does wonderfully well."
2,Let's cry about time travel!,"I watch a lot of old movies and am very used to melodrama. This film, however, plumbs the depths of manipulative sugary claptrap like no other. If your idea of a good time is wallowing in pointless ""bitter-sweet"" frustration and pity based on a laughably implausible time travel premise, then this is the film for you! I am giving this film two stars instead of one out of great respect for the actors, who did as well as they could with this dreadful material."
5,Great Movie,"This movie, starring Christoper Reeve and Jane Seymour, has a little something for everyone, from romance, to adventure, to time travel. It's worth the price just for the views of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island in Michigan. A much overlooked movie."
4,Somewhere in Time,Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition)A good movie which I am happy we were able to purchase as we just visited Mackinaw Island this year & visited the Grand Hotel where this movie was made.
5,#1 Romantic Movie of All Time !!,"I saw ""Somewhere In Time"" in the theater in 1979 with my ""first love""--It has been a very special movie to me ever since! The music (Rachmaninoff), the scenery (Mackinac Island) & combination of Reeves and Seymour is a timeless romantic masterpiece. Don't be logical when watching this one--Trying to figure out the ""why's"" & ""how's"" will spoil the mood!! Just enjoy!!"
4,ROMANCE THE OLD FASHION WAY,WELL IF YOU ENJOY ROMANCE THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU. CHRITOPHER REEVE LITERALLY DIES FOR LOVE. JANE SEYMOUR IS STUNNING AS THE WOMAN HE FALLS IN LOVE WITH BACK IN 1912. CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER HAS A CAMEO ROLE AS THE OVER PROTECTIVE MENTOR. ALL IN ALL A BRILLIANT CAST. A REAL TEAR JERKER FOR THE LADIES. A GLIMPSE OF WHAT LOVE COULD REALLY BE ABOUT. ENJOY BUT KEEP THE TISSUES HANDY. THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES INCLUDE INTERESTING FACTS RELATING TO THE PRODUCTION OF THE MOVIE AND ARE WELL WORTH THE TIME TO TAKE IN.
4,Why My Perspective Is Valuable:,"In 1980, when this film reached cable TV, I was an insufferably-obnoxious and entirely-nerdy nine-year-old boy. I approached the movie strictly as a fan of time travel (and, obviously, curious to see how ""Superman"" acted in other films.) I was not interested in girls, and I *certaintly* wasn't interested in romance stories.This film just punched right through all that, through the facade of cynicism and superiority young boys so often affect. It's a true tear-jerker -- rather than ""adding"" pathos to a mediocre plot, the situation is inherently conflicted. The romance of it is so undeniable, you don't need to be in love (or even BELIEVE in love) to be carried away by this overwhelming story.Having just ordered the DVD, I am recalling the film from memory. I may update this review after a fresh viewing."
4,Another love story,"It is a sad story, but I like love stories that have twist to them. I like stories that is a little bit off the normal."
4,sweet story,somewhere in time is a sweet movie.the idea of the movie is very romantic.the score by john barry is excellent-with the title theme being one of the most beautiful theme songs of any movie.the pic is worthwhile to see and enjoy.
5,"Haunting, wonderful, absolute best movie and DVD","This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time. I bought the DVD version and boy, was it worth it. To hear Elise say ""Is it you? Is it?"" is like hearing church bells ring. It's a beautiful and haunting story. Being without it in your collection would be like finding a 1979 penny in your pocket. (you have to see the movie... I'm not going to give it away). The DVD version is incredible. The interviews with the cast make the movie even more enjoyable. They discuss the filming, the location, how they all got along... if you like the movie already, buy this DVD, just for the extras."
5,Great Movie,Had not seen it in years so I purchased it and I still believe it is a well done film. Some don't understand the beginning but I think it is left up to interpretation.
1,Disappointing,"I saw this movie many years ago and remembered it as a truely great love story. Unfortunately time has changed my opinion. The plot is great and perhaps under the authorship of another screen writer the movie could have been great. Christopher Reeves acting was disappointing (just another version of Clark Kent). The way the story was implemented was truely unbelievable. Many plot elements didn't make much sense. The author missed many chances for good dramatic development. For example upon first seeing Reeves, Seymor says something like ""Are you him?"" Instead of leaving this thought of meeting Reeves as her destiny, the question is answered by Seymour saying later that her manager warned her about men who will approach her. Too bad, but this is an example of many lost opportunities to create a wonderful story. Get ""What Dreams May Come"" instead. Much better writting."
1,Somewhere in Time DEFECTIVE CD,"I have contacted this seller several times by email asking advice on what to do. NEVER A RESPONSE.This CD arrived at my home, loose in the case and broken. I am NOT happy with this seller at all. When they can't even respond to a problem, that makes me wary of their business ethics."
2,Not great,"I wanted to see a romantic and touching movie. This movie is contrived. The character that Reeve plays acts like a star-struck groupie. Personally, I don't find his behavior to be romantic. He seems like he is just like a groupie that is really excited that this actress is interested in him. This is not romantic to most women nowadays. He is not suave in the role he is playing. It seems like a cheesy 70's contrived romance that does a bad job of it."
1,"Beautiful period piece, but dreadful in every other way","I am a big fan of Jane's work in Dr. Quinn, and I finallysaw SIT on Netflix instant viewing. Although the historicalatmosphere is beautifully evoked, this was a perfectly terriblefilm on every other level. The story is simplistic but Icould overlook all that if it at least hung together. Butthe many unanswered questions (like the watch, what didit symbolize; was the Richard who registered in 1912 thesame one in 1978 or was it a name coincidence) ruin eventhis oversimplified story. Jane was lovely too look atbut her dialogue was very stilted. A big dissapointment afterall the hype I have read on the blogosphere. I recommendDr. Quinn for much more convincing on-screen romance."
1,The worst torque wrench I have ever used,"This torque wrench takes a lot of force to adjust. It is very stiff and hurts your hand. I was tempted to put it in a vice in order to get a grip on the twist handle with two hands. The markings are awful. One side has in-lb in large divisions of 120 and small divisions of 12. For example 75ft-lb is 75x12=900. So set at 840, then move up by 60 which is 60/12=5 small units. The other side is marked in kg-m, but after a few minutes I gave up try to figure out how the small divisions relate to the large divisions. The handle is too short for this range of force."
5,Excellent Product,The 1 ton chain hoist works perfectly. We used it to remove a 600pd. motor with absolutely no problems. Would recommend this product and seller to anyone.
5,Great!,"These are great books, however, the editorial review from kirkus is wrong. These novels may be technically two separate novels, but only in so far as they are two volumes. They are virtually incomprehensible apart from one another.I don't see how you could make any sense of either book without having read them in sequence.But it's an enchanting read - I could not bear a moment without Of Lodz and Love once I had finished Bociany."
5,collect the entire series,My 9 year old son won't rest until he collects the entire series; I'm just happy he wants to read!
5,"Review of Naruto, Vol. 3 purchase","I appreciate Amazon for making this pruchase available to me because if it weren't for Amazon.com and the seller of this item I wouldn't have been able to purchase this item I couldn't find anywhere else for my sons birthday, and this book is very important to him even though it is considered used. Thank you to Amazon.com and the seller."
1,Unbelievably worthless !,"This book contains no photographs, no inscriptions in Arabic script (just sort of Latin letters transliteration, so one does not need any Qufic or Nastaliq understanding for this booklet), no translations, of course, no prices, nothing, but dry and very brief verbal description of hundreds of 'virtual' coins. By its structure and contents the book resembles an inventary journal of a warehouse. I have no guess how this book can be helpful to anybody, novice or experienced...I also really cannot comprehend how this book could get 5-star reviews from some other reviewers - I would seriously question the integrity of their judgement!IMHO, this book is a complete waste of money and is good at most for paper recycling."
2,Simplistic and Repetitive,"Some allegories are written simplistically yet elegantly. Not so here. This book almost seems as though it's written for a child, though I don't think it is. The same points are hammered again and again. Sentences and thoughts are repeated over and over. Repeated. Repeated. For a much better example of a simply written fiction book that examines our reality in the universe, read Richard Bach's Illusions."
4,A very well told tale,"I had to read this book twice before I could write this. It's a quick read so that wasn't a problem. I'll likely read this book over and over again on down my timeline. This is a very good book. When you read it it will give you a lot to think about. So I say, for those wishing to ponder their own existence, this book will do nothing but help."
2,bad dvd disc,The number one disc in the set of six was bad. It kept hanging up and could not be cleaned.
5,Little House on the Prairie by:Jessica Beckner,"I love Little House on the Prairie. I'v only seen through the 7th season, but I can't wait to see season 8. All of my friends don't exactly like Little House, and I get on their nerves occasionaly when I talk about it. My favorite season on DVD so far is season 6 when Almanzo comes and also Percival!I strongly recomend the Little House on the Prairie searies to everyone."
3,Not as good as the first seven seasons...,"Little House is one of my favorite shows! I've always enjoyed watching it. BUT, after season 7, the LHOP writing crew seems to run out of ideas for story lines. Don't get me wrong, it's good, but it's not the same quality as before with the traditional Ingalls family and townspeople."
5,I Love LHOP!,"I love LHOP and wish this wasn't the last one. I was emotinal in how it all ended though. Blowing up Walnut Grove!! How sad, I wish Michael Landon ended it on a happy note but then not everything can end on such a happy note as happens in the typical fairy tale. My family and I have enjoyed the entire 8 seasons and reccomend it to anyone for good wholesome viewing. Be sure to check out what Michael Landon Jr. is doing with his camera these days, you will not be disappointed!"
1,Title Is Misleading...,"The problem with a lot of alleged scientists and hack writers is that they do not do their homework before the spew out a thesis and attempt to get the public to follow them like lemmings. This book is not a representative expose' on the true evidence for the possibility of Bigfoot's existence. As another reviewer put it, the author should have actually gone for a few hikes and explored the country and not just rehashed some schlock that they found in other writers' anti-bigfoot rhetoric. This book displays less about Bigfoot and more about poor writing and research. The publisher must have been blinded by the tabloid title and not even cared about factual information. There are FAR better books on BOTH sides of the ""Bigfoot aisle"". Just let this one continue to sit and get dusty."
2,Bad acting,Horrible casting of King Arthur. No wonder the show was canceled. Once Upon a Time is a thousand times better.
3,worthwile,"may not have been written so greatly, but still worth it, now i have a great crush on eva green whose acting is really really well done, and i start to search tamsin on the net but i prefer seeing her in the series than galleries of her on the net,with no offence on any literary materials, is merlin impotent despite having powers as Morgan says of Merlin when he is held captive in display and cannot help himself (either episode 9 or 10, can't remember as i already returned the dvd i borrowed) or Morgan describes him as such for he cannot in any manner seem to free himself,"
4,So So,"If you are a fan of Eva Green, then by all means get this series. She is excellent as Morgan. The other actors are ok. This is not as good as the HBO series Game of Thrones. I think the writing so far is average at best. The production values are first rate, a pity the story is less well done. I give it 3 starts for Eva Green and one the the rest."
2,Camelot,"The acting is not very good. The plot moves far too quickly to feel you can really understand what's happening and why it's happening. I feel completely lost watching it. I have only a vague memory of how the traditional Camelot story goes- it seems that a person would have to remember most of the details of the story to fully follow the show, even from the first episode. I'm not planning on watching the rest of the series."
1,Car-wreck bad!,"This series falls into an odd position - not good at all and too bad to be really any fun. The sets are like Xena (which was forgivable due to the comedic nature of that series), the dialog ATROCIOUS, and the plot muddled. The acting was a mixed lot - Fiennes PHONED in his performance, but Eva Green gave it her best shot. The ""action"" and the nudity may have spiced things up (ala 'Rome' or 'Spartacus'), if they were handled in a competent way. AVOID this show!"
2,As far as I could go,"I got as far as watching the third episode and decided I had had enough of a poorly written re-telling of an old tale, old themes and characters that did not fit the roles. Maybe I missed the point of some of the previous episodes this isn't a romantic re-telling, it isn't believable, it seems to be a sci-fi but it just didn't make it. The fantasy stuff was silly, the romantic scenes were silly. The director had to be unhappy with the lead actor, costuming was mis-matched, it seemed like the director couldn't decide if the characters should look like cave dwellers or wear futuristic fantasy costumes. Dialogue was ""campy"" and trite. Not a classic flick for sure not even a good made-for-tv series. I guess I'm too old school for any remaking of classic tales other than the way they have already be done, Regrave and Harris, Burton etc."
3,Sleaze and cheeze.. it's average,"I received this DVD set as part of the Vine program and had not heard about it prior to my selecting it. On broad terms, I would rate this series as average when compared to the entire population of shows on television. The average television show is mediocre, but it is something that provides entertainment if you just want to come home from work and zone out on a mindless distraction to pass the time.I found the characters to be rather stock (although Arthur seems to be miscast; he does not seem to be a kingly type). Aside from Arthur, everyone else fits a stereotypical mold and there's alot of overly dramatic acting. Others have commented about it being a low-budget production and that is how it seems to me - they have to keep the cameras in close to make it seem like there are a lot of people, but there really aren't that many people in the kingdom.Overall, it's a forgettable series but it works as a diversion for an hour of entertainment in an evening."
3,"A Great Cast, but the series lacked something","While Camelot has a large following and has had some very good reviews, I was disappointed with the Season One series. Politically correct to the extreme, Camelot does not fit the true time frame of other versions. A brilliant cast, led by Joseph Fiennes does not make up for the so-so writing and the yawn-worthy episodes. I would not recommend this version for those who like historical accuracy."
2,"Camelot - ""skewed""","The acting is fabulous, the visuals spectacular, and the story has been hijacked!This is NOT Camelot.It's Camelot - subverted/perverted. There is nothing legendary, presented. There are no moral victories. All the ""magic"" has been distorted, the ""tale"" misrepresented. Everything pertaining to belief is tossed out and made to be ""everyday,"" normal war, bickering, and terror.All the focal points...Lady of the Lake, Sword of the Stone, and even Merlin are re-written to be, basically, lies.IF you are expecting the series to resemble the legend, don't bother. It's a complete let down to the fantasy kingdom of yesteryear."
1,Not worth your time....,"I really anticipated watching this show and remained hopeful through the first few episodes. However, after about five episodes I stopped watching it and would have rather watched the nature channel. Pretty much everything is poorly done - the writing, the plot/direction of the show, and the acting which all come off as cheesy and sloppy. In my opinion it was hard to make this show ""not"" work because who doesn't want to watch a show about Camelot, but somehow they managed to do that. There are other good shows during this period like ""Pillars of the Earth"" and ""Game of thrones"" worthy of your time..."
3,Main characters are not convincing,"Characters are not true to the time. Arthur has no gravitas, Guinevere acts too ""modern"". The times are depicted in unrealistic manner. Yes I know this is mostly legend, but at least give us a more real backdrop. Otherwise, OK."
4,Camelot: The Complete First Season,I enjoyed this series and thought the movie was good. I'm looking forward to the second part of this series.
2,Hard to belive,"more people liked it than disliked it.Really had a hard time accepting the boy who plays Arthur, seems to me he should have been cast as the farmers pig boy, not as a ledgenday warrior king. I tried very hard to finish watching the series. Well I watched it, it's pretty much crap, but 2 stars for being better than staring at the wall.It was not even close to the anything like the legend, I guess the names were the same, that's the only nice thing I can say."
2,"Not a bad movie, Merlin TV series is much better!","Check out the Merlin TV Series, it is much better than this Camelot! The actors in Camelot do a good job at playing their characters, but storyline progresses much to quickly. The characters have to spend time explaining past events that should have had episodes dedicated to them. The worst thing of all is that this looks like a very low budget movie! Films based on history nearly always require huge budgets in order to be good."
5,Well I enjoyed it..,"I don't understand the hate for Camelot. You just can't go into it comparing it to anything else. You have to know it isn't Game of Thrones II. It's a bit campy, a bit tongue-in-cheek, and there is a bit of scenery chewing. But it was, for me, an incomparable light fantasy escape. My boyfriend hated it, but I loved it! With the love triangle being a primary focus, and with pretty boy Jamie as the lead, it makes me think Camelot is better suited for females."
1,Poor telling of the Arthur legend,"This could have been a great series, there are some good actors (noteably the Merlin character), but the program uses the legend of Camalot to tell a series of cliche modern morality tales."
3,Starts strong.... then.....,"First few episodes I thought: finally a great new show!Unfortunately the second half had much of the same old same old simple-mindedstuff we seen over and over in various shows.What a wasted opportunity! (Great actors, enough budget, cool mystical background.....)"
2,Please Don't Make Me Watch This Ever Again,"I was taught; if you don't have something nice to say, consider keeping quiet. So, this will be a short review...I was raised by my English Grandmother on the Arthurian stories; call them legends if you wish. I love this stuff, always have... always will.Please note that when I say that I love this stuff, I am not referring to the television series in question. For me, this series is just not watchable.Granted, everything about the series seems to be ""inspired by"" the actual Arthurian stories. For the modern, PC, younger audience that did not grow up with the old books and stories this may be just the thing. Not for me.The production quality and the transfer to DVD are good. That is about it."
2,The surf is flat today,"Why is it that king Arthur looks like a surfer ""dude"". And generally speaking the acting is bad and too dramatic. Too childish."
2,Save your money,"If you haven't seen this series, find it online first before you purchase. It's full of inconsistent writing and mis-casting. I wouldn't waste my money to purchase this....but find it online and view it for yourself before you spend your money on something you'd re-gift if someone gave it to you."
3,New twist on familiar tale,"Another take on Arthur and ""Camelot""? Indeed. While the production values here are pretty good, though everything is a bit well-scrubbed and placed in more original settings, the storyline re-workings are what draw a viewer to continue on this newest adventure of ""Camelot"". The development of the antagonistic relationship between half brother, Arthur and half sister, Morgana is the driving force of the dramatic huff-ings and puff-ings that carry the weight of the series. Fortunately, it's enough to carry our interest. At first, I wasn't sure about the lead actor playing Arthur- but the casting risk seems to pay off as we do get to see real growth of the character from the obstacles he has to overcome- many of them of his own making. I will be interested enough to watch a second season..."
3,A CAMELOT for the Kardashian age,"Starz attempts to turn the sturdy legend of King Arthur into a sexy nighttime soap opera with mixed results. Production values are high and most of the cast is game in creator Michael Hirst (of the excellent Showtime series THE TUDORS) and Chris Chibnall's rewrite which is decidedly more John Boorman than it is Lerner & Lowe. Joseph Fiennes gives an interesting portrayal of the magical sage Merlin but the central casting of Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur is perhaps the weakest screen portrayal of the famous king so far. However, the real fun is in watching Eva Green's delicious portrayal of Arthur's evil half sister Morgan le Fey. Whenever she is on the screen, she raises the proceedings up a couple of notches. Recommended for fans of 80s excess like Dynasty and Dallas, but certainly not for fans of T.H. White."
3,"We've seen this before, but it is pretty","First off, the production values on this series are just fine: vivd, colorful, seamless special effects, etc. As for the dramatic side of things, I have not seen this series, so I ordered this set thru Vine on spec. I suspected when I ordered it that I would be seeing something on the order of ""The Tudors"" (royal intrigue, family treachery), but hopefully not another version of ""Spartacus"" (overly stylized violence and sexual ambiguity). I was right. Lots of heaving bosoms, bare bottoms and perfectly white teeth. Ugh."
2,Not again...,"Camelot does to King Arthur what Twilight did to vampires. What used to be a cool, powerful figure is now some thin, late-teens style twerp.I couldn't make it through this whole set, to be perfectly honest, just because Arthur sucks. You can't have a good story revolving around the Camelot/King Arthur legend if your Arthur sucks this bad.Others have mentioned the PC cross-culture stuff, which historically doesn't fit well with the setting, but I don't really expect anything different from my TV these days. That doesn't bug me as much as Arthur being such a tool bag. I miss the days when male leads were masculine. I'm all for strong female characters on TV, but they shouldn't be dudes."
1,Eva Green is the only positive this show has going for it,"Where to start...This show has horrible acting (with the exception of Eva Green), poor script writing and the character Arthur is horribly miscast. This series is a horrible adaptation of a great story.I watched the entire season hoping it would somehow recover but unfortunately it only got worse. Many of the scenes are so bad they become actually comical. Not even worthy of 1 star."
4,Entertaining,"If you are looking to be entertained, this is a good series. It appears that a few of the more interesting characters may not be around for the 2nd season, but this is still worth your time. I would recommend catching it on Netflix streaming before you decide to buy it. Again, it is an entertaining show."
1,"Bad writing, weak story, trashy scenes","Despite a great soundtrack, filming, costumes and locations this series is plagued by bad writing, cheesy acting, trashy love scenes, and weak story. I tried to figure out who will like this series. It could have been interesting, they certainly spent a lot of money on it.Maybe next time the producers should consider spending some money on writers who can actually write a screenplay and won't have to rely on sex to keep the viewers attention."
3,I'm with Lady Morgan!,"5/5 stars for sexy Eva Green as Lady Morgan! ;-)I'm deducting a few points off for that evil criminal Merlin and dishonourable childish King Arthur. Down with both of them! Their actions make this series drag on like a British soap opera!If not for Eva Green as Lady Morgan to focus on, I would not have paid any attention to ""Camelot""!I'm marching off with Eva Green.... I mean, Lady Morgan! ;-PRecommended viewing:Merlin: The Complete First SeasonMerlin: The Complete Second SeasonMerlin: The Complete Third SeasonMerlin: The Complete Fourth SeasonMerlin: The Complete Fifth Season"
2,"O, Fortuna... what have you done?!","I hoped against hope that this show would get better. Never did. The acting was abominable, the casting of a weasel-faced tween as Arthur is laughable at best, and the relationships were hamhanded and superficial. The show has a production quality of campier things like Xena and Hercules... actually a lot worse in some cases. The greatest sin is that with this level of camp, there's no wit to go with it. No wink to the audience to let us know ""Hey, it's just for fun."" Nope... they want you to take this godawful show seriously. In a time where we can watch Spartacus or Game of Thrones as a way to gorge ourselves on wicked political intrigue, fantastic scapes and savage contests of martial brutality, this show falls short in every category. Save your money. While this show is on a premium channel, it's cable access quality. My condolences to Claire Forlani and Joseph Fiennes' career choices. Many happy returns, you poor lot."
1,camelot,"I liked this but wasn't there only one season. If I remember right, they cancelled and left us hanging. I don't think I want to buy the DVD and go through that again."
2,"Promises a lot, but gives only a little.....","If you are considering purchasing Camelot: The Complete First Season, it is probably because you are somewhat of a fan of Arthurian stories, or at least that is what my vantage was in watching a few of the episodes on television. If this describes you, then I promise that if you buy Camelot, you will be sorely disappointed. I wanted to love this series. It is eye catching and, at first glance, isn't afraid to be gritty. However, the dialogue is poorly written and the plot line is plodding and annoyingly predictable. It is pretty to look at though. Maybe watch it with the sound off?"
4,Like this series,"I didn't like this movie at first but I think it's because it came on the week after the series Merlin ended. I love Merlin so much and Camelot didn't settle with me at first. It was so different. But I gave it another week and it defenetly grew on me, and I ended up liking it and will sure watch the next season."
5,Bes show in years,"One of the best show in years it had all the elements action, romance, drama, Brilliant cinematography. The acting was superb the costumes were absolutely stunning! Jamie Campbell Bower is one to watch!"
2,Chris Chibnall strikes again,"CAMELOT isn't perhaps as bad as some of the reviews on here would paint it. It is however awfully mediocre at best. And I don't think that the acting is bad so much as the main roles being completely miscast... I stayed with it for about five episodes in the hope it would get better, but it never did..."
5,I'm Hooked,"Just watched the free trailer on Amazon Streaming, and OK, I'm interested in seeing more. This will be high on my list as soon as my Kindle Fire gets here 11/17 - or possibly earlier, Amazon???? Joseph was great as Merlin."
3,DOESN'T REFRESH THE ARTHURIAN LEGEND PROPERLY,"I gave up on this series somewhere during the third episode. Up to then it had potential especially when it seemed to get the costumes for the period correct but then it became a bit too campy and the usual Arthurian archetypes were a bit peculiar (i.e. Guinevere pulling a knife out on Arthur and pinning him to the ground when she had no combat ability, Arthur looking like a bleached blonde surfer who seems more of a dork than a military hero, etc). There's some saucy, sensual scenes in here as well as your usual run of violence and the settings are well done but I need to look at more than sunsets and this series just doesn't have it. That said, if you haven't studied a lot of the other Arthurian spins or just want to see some swords and sorcery this is an average presentation. WHEN WATCHED: August 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: C to C plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; FRESH TWIST ON THE LEGEND: C to C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus."
3,I can see why it was cancelled,"Being a devotee of the Arthurian legend, I thought I should give this series a chance to win me over. It didn't.In particular, I disliked the portrayal of Arthur. There was nothing remotely kingly about him. Instead Jamie Campbell Brown seems like a Golden Retriever puppy that needs to be housetrained.The scenery is beautiful, but it doesn't make up for the plodding storyline."
3,Please presentation of history,"Robert Bauval kicks off this 3.5 hour compilation with an extended interview, fascinating and convincing. Beginning with his discovery that the three great pyramids of Egypt mirror the size and arrangement of the three stars in Orion's belt, Bauval advocates looking at ancient civilizations with an astronomer's eye to explain the ancient's civilizations' behavior. The sky is a book we don't read anymore, he claims.Legend of the Serpent is the 2nd DVD, describing ""The Biggest Religious Cover Up in History,"" which I think might be a stretch. There's no doubt snakes have been a large part of religious iconography through the ages, and this pretty much covers it.The third DVD is a thought-piece by producer-director Gardiner, his ""history of the world,"" with strong emphasis on the spiritual, Knights Templar and other ""ancient wisdom"" presumably lost or hidden from us now.All in all, not a bad way to learn about the ancients and medieval times."
3,From Secret Societies to Sacred Snakes,"No shock that conspiracies have been around forever. Philip Gardiner has made a career out of studying them, it seems, and he puts a lot of that information into these DVDs. Secret societies, snake worship, all the way back to ancient civilizations, he shows what he believe is fact or myth. Whether or not you agree, it's interesting stuff."
1,ugh,well this one is not one I'm fond of.. i only read it for like 30 minutes.. i think that perhaps a 13 year old boy might be interested in this book but not me.. i really don't think i want to speak nihongo in such a tacky manner.. which is weird because i swear like a sailor in english.. i think i want to have a bit more class than that when i speak japanese.. it might be mildly entertaining to read on an airplane..all and all its awful.. i bought it for 3$ and ended up giving it to a library..
3,An informative but a little out-dated book,"Every language has its own ""dirty words,"" whether you like it or not. If you want to REALLY understand Japanese people and their culture, this book can be a help. This book is loaded with slangish terms and expressions, (by the way, the title ""Zakennayo"" is a ""correct"" phrase,) but even to me(30+ Japanese) many of them seemed either ""might've been cool a decade ago,"" ""my parents might say that,"" or ""only for mafias."" Anyways, read this book to understand Japan, but don't use the phrases unless you don't mind being labelled as a crazy, dangerous foreigner by Japanese people."
2,Austin Powers goes to Japan,"This book is for English speakers struggling with learning Japanese and want a comic book to stimulate some interest in continued learning. The slang is out dated and mostly likely used a few decades ago. The converse would be a Japanese coming to the USA speaking like Austin Powers, ""Groovy Baby!"" Naturally proper etiquette requires you would not speak such words in civilized company. As in the USA using out of date slang is most likely going to result in you getting laughed at, beat up or a combination of both. I say buy the book for a few good laughs and encourage yourself to learn more Japanese. I recommend Barrons CD set although it too is a little dated and when the Japanese women narrators speak they are almost inaudible."
3,Zakennayo!,"I found this book pretty useful- but would have liked it more if it had some way to easily find a word you're looking for, or an index in back so you can look up what page a word is on."
1,Hazardous to international relations,"This is the kind of book that makes me cringe. It goes far beyond its slightly risque predecessor ""Making out in Japanese"" and instead delves right into the downright vulgar. What is absolutely flabbergasting to me is that so many gaijin go out and buy this trash, spend countless hours memorizing its phrases, then actually say them in public. While it may get a few laughs in bars, the Japanese hearing this kind of talk are likely to think to themselves that the speaker is a real low-class loser. Don't buy this book, unless you want to sound like a moron. Instead invest a few more dollars in a REAL Japanese text. I promise, your Japan experience will be far more fulfilling."
3,Hmmm...read the review.,"Okay, on one hand, this book has some high calibre words if you want to piss someone off. However, it loses strength since it doesn't really attack the slang of the language in dictionary form, and depends on the reverse engineering of the dialogue in order to figure out how to use the phrases, etc. It was average, but I've seen better."
4,Still one of the best,Thirty years since this album was put together and memories come flooding back. I have been acquiring OZ music from 60-80s to remind myself that our groups and individuals were every bit as good as overseas productions.Great memories of great music.CheersMike
4,excellently awesome,"I have only heard a little bit of Flick's album Perfect Kellulight, but I am sure that this album is probably just as great as that one. I bought it from a listening station after hearing the track ""one hundred days."" It also has ""false you,"" ""milky way,"" ""something to say,"" and ""i like you."" I for some reason never kept up with what happened to Flick but I plan on buying Perfect Kellulight, like, right now!"
4,I was Surprised,I knew Duffy Jackson's name since I am a drummer but honestly I'd never heard him. This CD cooks. Big Band swing at it's best. AND a tribute to his Dad Chubby Jackson the bass player. If you like Big Band Swing. Get this now.
1,Pretty Dreadful!,"I just finished watching this seemingly endless and pointless film about a young gay documentary filmmaker's pursuit of love. I found the writing somewhat pedestrian, the camerawork and sound less than adequate and the acting acceptable. This is an extremely low budget work in severe need of additional editing, both in terms of its verbose script and lengthy scenes. I'm surprised I stuck with this terribly dull and annoyingly obvious film."
2,Hard to sit through.,While I like Dr. Laura & think a lot like her I'm afraid she missed the mark with this CD/Book. I've enjoyed most of her other books but didn't find this one particularly helpful or interesting. The CD version of the book basically spends hours telling you to get over your bad childhood & move on. It's rarely that easy. The only part of the book I found intersting was Dr. Laura's synopsis of her bad childhood. I think she should write an autobiography.
3,"nice, but could be better..","really my biggest issue is with the case, the items (clippers, file, etc) fall out of it easily."
1,not being recommended,It only taken 2 months for the nail clipper to brake in to 3 pieces. The facial hair scissors finger loops are to small for my fingers to fit in to the loops. In my opinion this purchase was a waste of money.
2,"Clippers are worthless, overall quality average","I was happy to receive this as a gift, but soon became disappointed in the cutting quality of the nail clippers. They do not work as well as the dollar bin clippers from the local pharmacy, so I replaced them.The file works well. I find myself using this more than any other piece in the kit.The case is a good size, but is difficult to close.I added a cuticle clipper to my kit, which fits behind the nail clipper in the picture. The case is big enough to hold an extra tool or two which is nice.Overall, I would not recommend this to anyone else. I am going to end up spending twice as much to replace all of the tools when I wish I just had a different kit to begin with.The lifetime sharpening is a nice idea, but you have to pay to mail the tools back to Tweezerman, and you also have to send them $8 per tool for return shipping. This is more than the price of the tools."
4,Clean up your act,"This set is a good compromise between ""manscaping"" and being a caveman.Trim your nose-hairs, get rid of the unibrow, and keep it in your travel kit."
3,Nice but not great!,"Nice set, but not the sharpest set. Does not make a clean crisp cut. Should have looked at a European made set."
2,much smaller than expected,"tiny, especially for the cost. I was expecting more. Probably my fault for not reading the size in the description"
5,Sony Clie for Dummies,"Knowing little about this type of PDA, I chose the ""Dummies"" aid to assist me. I've used these manuals in the past for other units. While some sections are basic and not needed, many are absolutely necessary to either understand or expand understanding of certain functions. They also allow me to return to areas that weren't needed initially, but surface at a later date. It's much easier for me to sit with the manual in front of me than to scroll through the chapter/section on a computer screen."
2,Disappointing.. None of his best songs,This at best is a 2. I LOVE WALTER HAWKINS!!! Ive been listening to him since I was a kid and he is simply the best! But this dvd was disappointing and I could have pasesed on it.
5,Diamond Dave Shows 'Em How It's Done--Best Album This Year,"One of the best albums I bought this year! Dave has so much character, imagination and life in his voice, he makes the singers in crap bands like Oasis, Matchbox 20, the new Van Halen, etc. all look like the whiny, lifeless little boys they are. Oh yeah, and save yourself the bloated atrocity of the new Van Halen 3 album. Dave is still kicking ass here and the music rocks. It's music 1000 times better than the MTV dung being shoved down people's throats! Give it a try!"
5,Awesome return,"The best thing to come from DLR or from Van Halen since Dave's last album. Is really a return to classic VH sound. If you like classic Van Halen you will love this album, John Lowery (currently with Marilyn Manson) got his start here and he is brilliant."
4,"Dave is back, but outside the US he is hard to get.","This is a great CD to reaffirm that Dave is still alive and kicking. New DLR fans may find the sound a little less bombastic than the usual radio rotation tracks found on the 80's albums, but the diehard DLR fans will immediately recognise the sound. This album apparently took very little studio time to record and master, so don't expect Def Leppard style clarity, just turn it up. In all the album has been one of my best album purchases this year even though it took me six weeks to get it shipped to Australia (Should have used Amazon). After all these years Dave still has something to say, and the tentative success of this relatively low-key album shows that we are all still listening."
5,The DLR Band is a modern rock masterpiece,"David Lee Roth's latest effort lights up the sky with an attitude that is pure Dave. It is an in-your-face attitude that has been missing from rock'n'roll in the 90's. Tracks, such as ""Wawazat"" and ""Relentless"" are incandecent and adptly titled. Vocals are strong and a put away any myth about Dave's singing ability. Dave shines and is inspirational. He makes me want to sing and dance and go get laid. Yeah, sign me up."
1,It is the worst that I've seen,"Is the state of rock so wretched that an album such as this gets raved about? I read all these people gushing over Dave's newest, so I went out and got it (being a big DLR and VH fan). What a mistake! I can't find one song on here that I would like to hear again! If you like Skyscraper and Dave's earlier stuff (from back when he had a clue), I can't imagine that you'll like this. Weak songs, stupid lyrics, inept choruses. And where's this great guitar work I heard about? Sounds pretty pedestrian to me. AWFUL."
4,Who Needs Eddie?,"This CD is really great, though it's hard to follow a classic tune like ""Slam Dunk"" with material of equal quality. It's truly a classic Roth tune, right up there with ""Unchained.""A lot of reviews on this page bemoan the demise of a reunited Van Halen, but everything on this CD beats the pants of ""Me Wise Magic."" For me, Roth was always the magic behind Van Halen. If you could turn his voice off on those early records, they would be pretty pedestrian, even with the great solos (that all sound the same after a while).As I write this review, news of yet another aborted Van Halen reunion has surfaced. Hopefully Roth can close this chapter of his life for good and keep delivering great material -- even if it's only heard by a handful of the faithful."
3,Dave remembers 1984!,"This CD is straight out of the 1984 VH book!! Dave is trying way too hard on this album. Dave at one time was the best, but he worked with the best. Most of the songs make me think that Dave thinks its 1984 again and Van Halen is on every radio. I wish Dave would have gone in to studio and made an honest album with a true to Dave sound. This album is not it!!"
4,Dave's back with THE attitude!,"If music can really move you to do things, this album with make you want to rock out, drink some beer and get laid! It's appropriate the album starts with ""Slam Dunk"", and some other good ones like ""Wawazat"" and ""Relentless"", along with some other goodies with good titles, like ""Lose the Dress (Keep the Shoes)"" and ""Weekend With the Babysitter"". This is his best work since the Van Halen days and his best solo album since Eat 'Em and Smile, and it contains some refreshing guitar on it. Also check out his book, Crazy From the Heat, it's a great read."
1,What record were you listening to?,"If this is Dave's best album, I don't even want to hear his less impressive stuff. I agree with the guy who gave it 1 star. There's not one good song on the whole CD! What a lame effort overall!"
1,Roth fumbles this one!,"DLR had great albums up through ""A lil' ain't enough.""This album, however, was so disappointing that I nearly destroyed it. I LOVE Roth's solo career prior to this album.The guitar work is uninspired, the lyrics are crap, the vocals are sub-par for Roth, etc.When everyone else was accepting Van Hagar, I was holding out for Roth.Silly me. At least Mr. Hagar knew how to run a solo career."
2,An accurate chronology of his life and war in desert,"This video is a brief overview of Lawrence's life from birth to death. Although it was made on a shoestring budget with very inexpensive effects, it does give a very accurate overview of the desert war and Lawrence's role in it. It sticks to the basic facts of Lawrence's life and takes what he said about himself to be true instead of trying to create all sorts of mystery around him. Although the costumes are awful and the actor portraying Lawrence looks (and probably acts) nothing like him, this video would be an excellent presentation for students in a history class. Just the facts!"
1,LAME,"There the same friggen songs as hybrid theory and meteora. Getting sick of this remixed/same songs on every c-d crap. oh yeah the song sounds a little different but, not different or new enough to waiste money on. they should either STICK with hybrid theory and meteora or make somethin new. Now look all you LP fans, I LOVE linkin park. Im just tired of the same songs coming out remixed or normal. and for 15 bucks. not worth it."
5,An excellent option to different diagnosis,"Never a comprehensive book but an excellent practical clinical approach for basics in multiple differential diagnosis accompanied with very very good images overall a great book, it has an interesting chapter with diseases related to an specific clinical manifestation."
5,Good book.,I ordered this book when I became a school administrator. I think you can never learn enough tips from books such as this.
4,It's good if you like a light mystery.,"It's a good book to while away some time. It would be helpful to jot some notes on who people are in the book. If you like light mysteries that are not solved completely at the end, then you will like this book."
4,"A fun, literate page-turner","I read this book over the summer and loved it. The story was believable and kept me interested. The main characters were likeable and the author's way of approaching the rather ""dry""/ academic subject of the Shakespeare authorship was well done and accessible. I didn't know much about the authorship controversy before reading this book, but I found the theories explored both easy to follow and ultimately intriguing. However, what I enjoyed most about this book was the way Sarah Smith depicted Boston and contemporary/ Elizabethan London, and allowed me to escape to these places in an instant."
2,equalman review,This book starts out very intriguing especially for those who are Shakespeare fans and also for Shakespeare neophytes. It's good for the neophytes because you can glean a lot of information in a palatable/fictional format as presented by Smith. The book gets a bit long and painfully detailed midway through. This novel would probably be a 2.5 if the content was edited down significantly. The ending did a poor job of wrapping up the characters and story line.
5,Great Characters and a Great Read!,"For me, Chasing Shakespeares isn't as much about who wrote Shakespeare as it is about why we want to know. In this regard, Joe Roper is an admirable character and a memorable hero. Some of the other characters are less admirable, less heroic, but still interesting. Sarah Smith made me want to know more about all of them. And certainly, there's plenty left unresolved at the end to fill a sequel. Let's hope! I also recommend her mystery series that began with The Vanished Child."
5,Great Escapism!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I got very caught up in the historical references and the intrigue. Although the author freely admits to embellishing or fabricating some of the literary references and historical events, I found this story to be very thought-provoking. Even folks who don't consider themselves to be Shakespeare fans would enjoy this one - a little romance, a little mystery, and a lot of literary education. Anglophiles will love the description of modern-day London!"
5,"Recipes for potpourris, scented candles, and more","Aromatherapy uses aromatic plants to impart a feeling of well-being and peace: Aromatherapy Through The Seasons tells beginners how to incorporate aromatherapy basics into a home and lifestyle. Chapters provide recipes for potpourris, scented candles, moisturizers and more, with plenty of formulas for enhancing all aspects of life."
5,Perfect for Beginners and Useful Long Afterwards,"Paula and Judi have compiled an incredible introduction for someone new to aromatherapy. The book is so easy to follow and read, and the blends are so easy to make and use. In addition, the blends in this book are timeless. You won't outgrow this book. What I liked the best about the blends is you see results immediately. To top it off, it's one of the most beautiful books I've seen. Great on the coffeetable, a great conversation piece, and forever in use. Keep it handy!"
3,"This old version is interesting, but...","if you're looking to run a meeting using parliamentary procedure, buy the 10th ed., which has superceding rules and is in the modern English. This is a reprint of the original of 1907. However, if you just want some information on the basics of order or are wanting to see how these rules have evolved, then you might find this interesting."
1,width size misleading,I ordered the widest slipper in my foot size (EEE) but was unable to even wedge my foot into the slipper. It cost me $9 postage to return for credit. I'm wondering if other Amazon customers had the same experience. Morris Eisenberg
5,Sizes Run Correct,"I also have a heck of a time finding shoes for myself.I wear a size 15 and stores typically don't stock sizes that big.So, buying shoes online you run the risk of not being able to trythem on before buying them. So, you have to read the reviewsand trust what people write. I read the reviews and from what Isee, this slipper runs small. That being said, I ordered a size16 thinking it would fit perfect. The slippers arrived todayand they are too big. The size (at least the big sizes) runcorrect. So I am returning these size 16's and ordering mycorrect size, 15. Hope this helps somebody out.Other than than, these look like quality, warm slippers. Iam sure I will enjoy them when my size finally arrives !"
3,Not the Greatest Thing since Sliced Bread,"Comfy slippers but not the bee's knees. They do run small; my size 9.5 foot is still searching for some more room in the size 10 slippers I bought. I'm sure it will stretch in time with wear. Oddly, these are made in that place that starts with the letter ""C"" and ends with an ""A"" (not California). Had I known, I would have spent a few more $$$ to buy from a US source. One annoying aspect is an extremely poorly placed tag on the inside of the shoe, at the instep (where the elastic band is on the side) that rubs. Again, I imagine the discomfort will lessen over time with wear. I view these as slippers, and would not wear these outside. Perhaps to fetch the newspaper or the mail in my robe, but not when I leave the house. Unless I want the absent-minded look... I am keeping them, but there have to be better and more comfortable choices than these."
2,Company difficulty,"The shoes were fine but dealing with the company is difficult. I need to get a refund and they didn't include a shipping label with the order. In my correspondance with them, they couldn't find my name,address, zip code, nor proof of order! One inquirey was answered, another ignored."
4,Klondikes,Nice slippers. Too bad they are made in China. I hate buying Chinese stuff. How is that helping our economy? This is very upsetting and you should be ashamed that you cannot find American made stuff to sell on-line.
3,Wondering about quality,I've only worn them a short time now and the interior is starting to rub off or bunch up. The exterior feels well made.
2,Review of men's slipper,I had to send the slippers back and will not reorder the same slipper. I ordered a size 12 and they were too big in length but too tight across the top of his foot. We knew there was no way a smaller size would fit him because it would probably be even tighter across the top of his foot. He has a normal foot so we were surprised at the odd proportion of the slipper. The quality of the slipper was good and the price was reasonable.
5,Size Fit Perfectly,"I have always worn a size 10 so I went ahead and bought 10 even though so many reviews said they ran small. They fit perfectly, and I love them. They are very comfortable. They weren't though the first day I wore them. They were tight on my toes and rubbed my ankle a little. After a half hour, I fell in love. They are very nice slippers and fit perfectly. I am glad I didn't buy a size 11 because my foot would be slipping in and out."
5,Just what my husband was looking for!,Fit great and are comfortable. The bottom is supportive and just right for being able to make that quick outdoor trip.
5,Great slippers!,"These slippers fit and feel terrific. As important as fit and feel are, durability certainly ranks right up there. These slippers are of excellent quality and made of tough, durable materials. My second pair (and not the last), the first pair lasted for nearly 4 years and the only reason they ""gave up"" is that I walked through the soles (outside). As these are ""slippers,"" they performed well above their intended role. You can pay more for slippers but it is unlikely you will find better at any price."
1,Problems for tender feet,"When the slippers arrived I had socks on. I tried the slippers and they fit fine and felt great. then I started walking around and could feel somthing under my heel. It was the label that is made of rough cloth and heavily stitched in both slippers. The stiching was so heavy and deep that removing the labels took a sharp razor knife and ten minutes per slipper. OK now no lump under my heel. Then later the socks come off and the not so soft leather that hems the entire opening starts rubing my ankles.I did not expect to need socks while wearing slippers. The design is nice, the trim material down right dumbin my opinion. slippers should be soft where ever they contact your skin."
3,Bought wrong size,"I had read that these were sized smaller than normal so I ordered one size larger. That was a mistake because they're wearable, but too large. I wear thick sox to compensate. For the price they are well made."
3,Snug,Ordered a wide slipper but keep forgetting Chinese wide & American wide are 2 different measurements. Kept product anyway thinking since it is a house slipper it will stretch a little.
5,Great quality,"Without a doubt the best house slippers I have ever purchased in my 85 plus years. They are a great fit and even greater quality. I would heartily endorse this product and will buy again and again. They feel really great and look great! These are the first mail order slippers that have been so great right out of the box. After wearing for a few hours, they get more and more comfortable."
4,Good house shoes,"The slippers are nice and comfortable. Many reviewers suggested ordering a size larger. I did, and the shoes fit fine."
3,not a fit,I am a size 11 in every shoe or slipper I wear. This slipper in size 11 was big enough that I was nearly walking out of the slipper. I returned it disappointinly at my cost ($12.00). Purchase Dockers size 11. Perfect fit.
2,Spaniards invade Mystara,"A large part of this campaign's background constitutes what I consider to be one of the most unoriginal settings ever gotten to print. This setting seems to promote wholesale dumping of real- world history into a fictional setting. Not only is this extremely contrived, but it also is an insult to role-players' creativity in general. The ""setting"" is thinly disguised Central America of approximately sixteenth/seventeenth centuries, spiced with mutations. Pretty much everything is named in very generic Spanish (White Mountain, Blue House, Long River). Most of the campaign seems to emphasize recovery of treasure left by the long-gone Aztec-like culture. There is hardly any role-playing at all: virtually the entire campaign screams ""combat-oriented dungeon crawl"". The Legacies resulting from the ever-present ""Red Curse"" are somewhat interesting, but the setting hardly tangles with the implications of wide-spread mutations. A very poor job from TSR."
1,Not worth the trouble,"I bought one of these for each of my boys. They just did not care for it at all. The Spiderman is really tiny compared to their other action figures and his punch action is NOT easy to work at all. You turn the torso around to make Spiderman punch, but there is NOT a way for little fingers to do this with one hand. They are already asking for a better Spiderman toy."
1,Unfortunate,Do not purchase this item if you have a 5.4 3v liter engine. It will not fit. The Amazon parts finder is incorrect. The 5.4 liter engine pcv valve is built in to the valve cover and is not available separate. Motorcraft EV279 fit a 4.2 liter engine. I returned the item and was charged a restocking fee and do not wish for this to happen to someone else.
5,great collectable,i bought this car for my boyfriend who has an actual car of this type. he was enthusiastic about it and appreciates the gesture. thanks for your help
1,"This isn't a book, it's fuel for my fireplace.","This book is terrible. A fun read, but terrible. It's like eighties action flicks involving Stallone, Ah-nold and Swayze. They are a lot of fun, but don't go looking for anything other than gun and explosions and a hot chick to drool at.Gemmel borrows elements from the Western man-in-black tradtion (go read Shane instead), fantasy's creatures, and sci-fi's vision of parallel worlds with some religion thrown in as a bonus (read Heinlein's Job: Comedy Of Justice). Gemmel can plot - he just can't write. At least, not well. Shannow is a stiff, inflexible, two dimensional character - and the Deacon isn't any better. Flat out? Read this book because it's the last book on the shelf and you have burned the rest for fuel for the fire to heat your home. For any other reason, it's inexcusable."
3,A fun romp,"I've enjoyed Gemmell's novels, particularly the Druss stories. However, after reading most of his books, it becomes obvious they all follow a general formula. It doesn't make them any less fun to read. The formulaic parts just make them comfortable. The was my first John Shannow story and yet, it didn't seem new to me. There's a definite Clint Eastwood-type of western influence on the story, but it is also similar in many ways to Gemmell's ""Hero in the Shadows."" It took me a little while to get oriented to the story. The prologue, in particular, seemed disconnected with the rest of the story for a long time. It's not deep fiction, but it's definitely a fun adventure featuring a flawed hero."
3,Super Reader,"This is definitely the least interesting book of the Jon Shannow stories. Shannow is basically retired, living in peace under a different name.However, a crazed Deacon and his band go around trying to impose their own insane morality on people going happily about their business.When they try some of their tricks around Shannow, the Jerusalem Man returns. Shannow's life is spoiled, and he gets angry."
5,A typical Gemmell book. Keeps you gripped until the twist.,A typical Gemmell book. It will keep you gripped right up to the twist at the end. So far he hasn't written a dud.
4,I really enjoyed listening to Marian,"If you want to hear what a really good piano duet sounds like, check out ""Lady Be Good"". I cannot stop replaying it. When listening to ""When the Saints go Marching In"" I can only think to myself ""Now this is a woman who knows how to play the piano"". It was a very moving and sensative arrangement"
4,A huge timesaver!,"This product will save you an incredible amount of time. Easly trim photos into interesting shapes and create matching mats to place them on. The kit contains the Fiskars Shape Cutter plus a cutting mat (use the self-healing side) and four shape templates. You save quite a bit of money purchasing them in the kit rather than seperate. One bit of warning: the shape cutter takes a little getting used to. Practice on scrap paper the first few times and if you're still having problems go to a local craft store and ask them to demo it for you. I promise once you get the hang of it you'll love it, but it took me a few tries to get it right."
2,Not very useful...,"The ShapeXpress cutting tool is easy to use, and very easy to change the blade, but don't cut well... I don't know if this is 'cause I'm left handed, but the blade turns everytime, can't complete any shape without spoil at the end... If you want good shapes, I better recomend a paper trimmer/guillotine, and a corner paper punch, or shape paper punches.The cutting mat that came in the set is very good."
2,It cuts!,"It's a knife, it cuts things, so its good at that. However the handle and case are cheap, but you get what you pay for. Would recommend this knife to anyone with a couple more dollars to spend."
2,If you enjoy reading dissertations......,"Over 70,000 Mennonites emigrated from Russia in 1874 to seek religious freedom. The author focuses on 35 groups (churches) in Central Kansas from four major areas of Russia. But because of each groups' diversifications and specific differences between the groups themselves, the author was not able to make the information in, or the reading of, the book flow.Not to be considered for ""just a good read,"" or not useful for research or information as there is no index."
3,Okay if you've never written an extension.,"If you need the basics of how to approach extension design, get this book. It will teach you how to build working extensions.However, it's very limited. In spite of their claim that it includes ""Detailed coverage of DW and DW UD internals"", it covers very few of them.But, worth it for beginners."
4,Good Buy For The Money,"I purchased this scope for my CVA muzzleloader. Very clear for the money. I have sighted this scope in and it handled the shock of 150 grain, but the real test will be when one steps out at 100 yds +. If I had to do it over again I would have spent $10-$15 more and got the 2.5-7 x 32 mm. This scope is a fixed magnification scope."
2,all wet,"If this were a fictional story, it would be a pretty good one. My problem with it is that it pretends to tell a young audience - yes, it is a juvenile book, though not so labeled - a multifaceted, deeply moving historical story of bravery and significance. But it does so with grossly misrepresented and/or invented characters, false ""facts,"" and pure historical invention. Once this nonsense enters the mind, it's difficult if not impossible to replace with the truth, which is far more interesting anyhow."
5,What Jackie Taught Us,As a child of the 60's my first impression of Jackie Kennedy Onassis was that of dignity and grace. Flaherty's book is very detailed on how she accomplished this along with the courage she had shown throughout her life. A must read!!!!!!!!
3,A siimple look into the fascinating life of Jackie O,"This book was boring at times, and I found the writing to be quite simplistic. I actually checked the back jacket to see if this woman was actually an author. I hardly think living in the same building as Jackie Kennedy makes one qualified to write a book about her. However, there were some interesting parts, and while I don't think the book was the best thing ever written, it was written respectfully and did bring attention to important lessons like havig manners, having a love for learning, and sticking to your ambitions. I'd reccomend this book, as long as you don't go into it with very high expectations."
1,a very on the surface book,"This book is not for serious readers, people who would hope to find an insighful and serious understanding of the subject. It merely touches the surface of a myriad of interesting questions. The language itself is shalow, repetitious and the few scatterd thoughts of the author are utterly unoriginal and mundane."
3,Nothing New here - But Interesting,"There is nothing new about the ever fascinating Jackie in this book. I guess that would be hard given the volumes deveoted to her. However, the book is well written and the subject matter is always interesting."
3,I sure wish I'd gotten it from the library instead,"I collect Kennedy books so when this one came out I bought it and couldn't wait to get it home. I wasn't satisfied. First,Tina Santi Flaherty didn't actually know Jackie and makes some conclusions that even Mrs. Onassis's friends and colleagues did not make in their books. That made me ""trust"" the book less. I think buying Leticia Baldridge's book or the Eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy would be better bets for the money. In the universe of Kennedy books this is a lesser light."
2,Chapters are repetitive,"Each chapter contains basically the same information presented in a previous chapter. At the end of a chapter, the author uses the same sentences slightly modified to summarize the chapter. The author got a lot of the information from Sarah Bradford's book, ""America's Queen"". I suggest this book for more detail."
2,Decent but overpriced,"It's not a bad package all in all -- lightweight, runs off C batteries or an AC power adapter, charges your iPod when docked, and has dock adapters for all but the newest iPod nano models. It was a pleasant surprise to find that the box also included a 1/8"" phone plug cable for connecting non-iPod devices and a 12V car power adapter.My iPod mini and 5G iPod fit snugly into the dock, and the secure fit makes it much easier to use the click wheel than on competing products where the iPod can wobble a bit.The sound quality is merely adequate and bass is nonexistent. You just can't expect very much from such a small unit. So much for the ""Rich full sound"" promised by the advertising copy.I'm rating it only 2 stars because it's not worth the MSRP. I was able to pick one up for a good deal less than list price because of a sale at the local electronics superstore, but with the normal pricing it just doesn't offer a whole lot for the money."
3,Radio Stations Reset when changing outlets,"Thats my only complaint. I plugged and unplugged from same outlet in my room and it was fine, but once I went to another room I lost all my stations.Its a nice little system though for the price though.Big Plus unlike most systems your iPod is safely enclosed inside so if you are somewhere where it might get splashed, touched my little hands or you just don't want your ipod totally exposed its great. You do have to remove the clear plastic face to get to change your playlists though.Another nice thing is that the little remote tucks nicely on top rear of unit under the handle."
3,Reliability less than expected,"I bought these speakers mainly for the flexibility of power supply: 110V AC, 12V DC, or C batteries. Other nice features are the enclosed iPod dock that provides a bit of protection, FM radio, and the remote. The sound is not too bad, and the price is right. However, the unit I got started failing after less than 3 months. When turned on, it would play OK for a few minutes, then emit a horrible screech and then only noise. Fortunately I bought it at Costco, so I was able to return it without any hassles (I threw away the original box.)If you decide to get it, keep the original box for at least a few months."
1,worked 3 days,"I bought this boombox for use at an event last year. I used it for 3 days. Last year I would have given it 4 stars, but unfortunately, I attempted to use it for the same event this year (1 year later) now I would give it a zero. The speakers won't work for iPod or Radio. There is still power, since the iPod charges. But, nothing comes out of the speakers. I question the quality of iHome after having to return a clock radio for a replacement after 6 months, and now this iHome boombox. So 2/3 iHome products were defective."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the company. They advertise it as compatible with Ipods and that it will charge them while in use. They don't tell you that it will not charge the latest Ipod models and that to even use it with them you have to purchase an additional item (which turned out to be a small piece of foam tape). Since I needed to use the boom box and Ipod where I did not have access to a computer, I had to purchase a separate Ipod charger."
1,Low quality product,"I bought this product two different times. The first time it was missing the AC adapter, so I returned it and swapped it for a new one at a store. This new one would not charge my ipod--instead it produced this burning smell, which made it seem like it was frazzling my ipod.That aside, the sound quality is OK. The volume goes up plenty loud, but if you are really into music you will probably not like the mediocre level of sound quality.I would not recommend this product to anyone. There are many other ipod players to choose from that are similar prices to this one.Don't risk frying your ipod. It would be very costly to replace!"
2,Another bad sounding ipod boombox,"This would be nice for a child or quiet office but the speakers do not offer great sound quality. The ihome ipod system we have mounted in our kitchen has much richer sound than this, I'm not sure why this one sounds so tinny when it's the same brand and price range. I guess there just isn't a portable ipod player in the $50-60 range that offers great sound.So we went up to the $100 range and purchased an Altec Lansing iM600USB Portable Speaker System here on Amazon. The Altec is exactly what we were looking for with all the same features as this radio; but offers richer sound WITH ACTUAL BASS and depth, it's sleeker looking, and has a rechargeable battery! Worth the extra money."
2,"Right features, poor execution","As far as features this has everything I could want. But in reality I found it to be cheaply made and the sound quality is that if a $20 radio. No ""deep rich sound"" as they claim."
5,"For those with a little background, it is a page-turner","While this book may not be so useful to tantric practitioners, for the rest of us it makes this very difficult material much more accessible. Davidson covers a daunting amount of material and does so in an interesting fashion. When I first read it, I couldn't put it down. Since then, I have assigned the book twice to my undergraduate classes. In year-end evaluations, the majority of my students considered it to be invaluable to understanding the rest of the tantric material I assigned. There are a few chapters that offer more detail than is of interest to the non-specialist (such as his chapter on Early Medieval India). But anyone who has tried to piece together portions of Indian dynastic history from original sources that will appreciate the fact that he makes a daunting task look relatively easy!"
2,"Good scholarship, wrong discipline","Here is a professor of religious studies who is not an insider of vajrayana buddhism, and has given himself the task of 'demystifying' it through traditional western historic analysis. Though it is very interesting to hear about the geopolitical situation of the time, he assumes that this alone is what gave rise to the tradition. Thus, it's a newly revamped 'degeneration of buddhism' theory, despite the fact that this is a living religion, and that consultation of those who still practice it yields more valuable insights than an ordinary devotee of scholar ego."
2,Nothing special,"I bought this ear cuff for $9.95 before it turned to $15.95. It's just a plain super thin cuff. If it's not worth the $9.95, it's definitely not worth the $15.95."
4,BREVILLE SMART OVEN,"I USE THIS EVERY DAY.IT MET MY EXPECTATIONS, AFTER READING MANY REVIEWS I DECIDED TO SPLURGE AS IT IS QUITE EXPENSIVE.IWOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
4,Excellent Compilation For The Drum N' Bass Enthusiast,"This cd has a compilation of what drum and bass should be, no crummy dance nor poor mix's, this cd is just great, another great one from ITM"
5,A Great Religious Album,"This is probably the best CD the Brothers Bellamy have done in quite awhile. Everything clicks here. Several songs reveal a great spiritual reverence and beauty, while others contain a nice touch of humor. My favorite cut is ""Spiritually Bankrupt,"" but each song is a gem."
5,Great Christian music for the hippie generation,"In this CD the Bellamy Brothers lend their talents to Christian music with their own country/hippie slant. There's some really pretty songs like ""Beautiful Night"" that I love playing in the evening, or fun ones like ""Old Hippie Saved"" which relates back to the Hippie generation. Great music for anyone who has been through that era and has now made a Christian commitment. It is my 65-year-old husband's favorite CD--we have listened to it over and over and he NEVER fails to laugh over the title song ""Jesus is Coming."""
4,Good Gospel Music,"This was a Hard CD to find, but a great bunch of music for easy listing. thanks for having it. Now if you could find in CD, God came through Bellvile Georgia but he didn,t get of the train, By Tom T. Hall, Iwould love toget my hands on."
4,CD review,"""Jesus is Coming"" by the Bellamy Brothers is a pretty good CD. It takes me a while to warm up to any CD when I first get it. I need to listen to it several times before I really decide if I like it or not. I have a feeling that after several ""listens"" this will be like the rest of my Bellamy collection and It will be one of my favorites."
4,If you like modern talking,"This pop-group reminds me a lot of ""Modern talking"",so if you like that kind of music,you should buy this album.And if you like music from the 80's (in remixed versions) this should be the album for you."
1,Horrible,This book makes me sick. The detail in how pirates torture people they find at sea is disgusting. This is definitely not a book for kids -- if I want my kids to imagine life as a pirate I don't want them pretending to be monsters.
4,Hercules and Goliath posters!,"Spanning the years 1932 - 1970 ""Mighty Movies"" is a visual treat for movie lovers like myself. Packed from cover to cover with around 200 vintage posters of Biblical epics, swashbucklers and sword and sandal spectacles like HERCULES UNCHAINED and GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON. I couldn't help but dream about how wonderful it must have been to watch all these movies in the theater.In addition to all the great posters Bassoff has added lots of information about the movies themselves. One interesting fact I learned was in 1912 the Astor Theatre in Manhattan raised it's ticket price from 15 cents to $1.50 for Guazzoni's now lost QUO VADIS!Here are some of the posters I enjoyed the most:NORTHWEST PASSAGESAMSON AND DELILAHMUTINY ON THE BOUNTYTHE PRODIGALGOLIATH AND THE SINS OF BABYLONGOLIATH AND THE VAMPIRES"
5,Mighty Movies: Movie Poster Art from Hollywood's Greatest Adventure Epics and Spectac,"Terrific publication. Kudos to the seller as well. Book is in ""like new"" condition. Arrived promptly. Colors are bright and clear in each instance and even the corners of the book are straight and unbent.Buy with confidence from this seller !"
5,A Student-friendly Book,A straight-forward book about research in the TESOL (and SLA) field. Not overwhelming at all.
2,Huh??,"I am actually writing this review before I have heard the entire CD. I just need to know why this is the third straight disc that contains ""NYC Girl"" & ""Keys To Your Heart"". I don't get this at all. His last album had 5 repeat songs from the one preceding that, and now this one repeats some of them again. Maybe after his nect release, I will be able to compile a complete disc of new material."
3,Ho-hum,"We got the DVD called Diggers & Dozers about tractors and construction from this set first and it was great. If I'd gotten this one first I probably wouldn't have purchased any of the rest of the series. I'm sure a lot has to do with your little ones interests and ours may grow into liking this one as he gets a little older. He was obsessed with tractors when he was tiny (18 mos) and has really enjoyed the tractor one and still asks for it even now at 3 and will continue to enjoy it for a good while. If your kid is into boats, water craft, or rescue this may be the one for them."
5,MIGHTY MACHINE BOATS,"OUR 5 YEAR OLD NEPHEW LOVES ALL OF THE MIGHTY MACHINE DVD'S. WE HAVE ODERED HIM 6 OF THEM AND HE STILL WANTS MORE . HE WILL SPEND HOURS WATCHING THEM. I NEVER HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT WHAT TO GIVE HIM AS A GIFT AS LONG AS WE INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE MIGHTY MACHINE DVD THEN HE THINKS EVERYTHING ELSE IN HIS GIFT PACKAGE IS ALSO GREAT.THE PRICE FOR THESE ARE REALLY AFFORDABLE WHICH ALSO ALLOWS US TO GET HIM SOME EVEN FOR NON BIRTHDAY,CHRISTMAS EVENTS ETC."
2,Before digital,An older book about lighting for Film cameras. Too basic and just not that helpful in shedding light on the details of shots.
3,Not a good beginners book,This book needs diagrams. Some of the examples are only for the very knowledgeable. There are better books dealing with lighting
4,An excellent starting point,"If you are interested in doing mainly portrait photography, but need to learn more about how to properly and effectively do lighting setups, this book is an excellent place to start. The book has several diagrams of exactly how the lights were setup, along with actual photographs that were taken using each setup.It talks briefly about how to deal with different types of people, and includes a short part on photographing pets as well. There are also sections on lighting still life photography, although this is not the main focus of the book. If people portraits are what you are interested in doing, this book will be an excellent reference. However if you are more interested in photographing still lifes or pets, I'd recommend that you either find another book, or use this in addition to another resource."
3,Too broad to be helpful,"Though there are clearly things in here that will be useful to any photographer I found that, in general, it covered too much material in too little detail. I think you need to be an experienced studio photographer with a lot of gear and equipment already to make much use of this book. I think beginners, like myself, who want to establish a solid foundation will not find it as helpful. That is the situation I am in and wish I'd gotten ""The Portrait"" from the Lighting series."
2,Fair outdoor camera,"Pros -- Nice lens easy setupCons -- Low light focusThis camera takes pretty good pictures in good light. It won't focus in low light. By low light I mean normal night-time in your house lighting. With outdoor lighting, I haven't had a problem. There is a work-around for focusing indoors, that works pretty good. You can fix the focus for 1 or 3 meters, or there is a manual focus setting. The manual focus setting is cumbersome, in that you have to set the zoom then switch to manual focusing. So it is pretty slow.I wouldn't buy this camera again knowing what I know, but I can get some pretty good pictures with it working around its quirks."
3,"Not a bad camera, but there are better ones",This a good camera. I had it for a while until it stopped working and I had to take it back.I upgraded to the Minolta DiMage Z1 but I still very muched like this camera.Cons:
1,Big Disappointment,"I wanted a digital camera with a 10x optical zoom and bought this online without checking it out in a store first. BIG mistake. Had nothing but trouble with auto focus, even on close items. Quality of photos was poor as well (very grainy) even on maximium pixelization. Had to cut my losses on shipping and send it back. I have since checked out the Minolta Z1 in a store and immediately saw a world of difference. I am also going to look at the Olympus 740UZ since I had great performance from my first Olympus (just not enough zoom). I guess Toshiba should stick with what they do well, because cameras is not their forte."
4,Not that bad,"I bought this camera right after it came on the market in order to get better shots of my kids playing baseball and soccer. That is why I wanted the 10X zoom. I immediately realized that a tripod or monopod are required in order to capture zoomed shots that are not blurry. I have managed to capture a lot of very good shots at full zoom using a monopod. Image stabilization would be great, but that adds a lot of cost and bulk to digital cameras. This camera has a lot of manual features that should be explored to get the best out of your pics. It does have crappy flash quality (grainy) most of the time, but that is not why I wanted it. Good camera with lots of high-end features for the price IMHO."
1,What a Nightmare!!!,"When my husband and I saw this camera we were amazed at the features this camera had compared to the cost. Well, I guess you get what you pay for. We were very disappointed in the zoom on this camera. Whenever we would try to zoom it would just be fuzzy and not clear. I did order this camera in November so that I would have it for my baby's first Christmas. Well, on December 23, it broke - it just wouldn't come on anymore. We tried 4 different sets of batteries, a different memory card, we tried everything and it just wouldn't come on. Needless to say, we sent this terrible camera back and we are now going to purchase the Fuji S5000. If I could give this camera 0 stars I would."
3,Measuring Investment Performance,"A good reference book for the basics. It covers rates of return and differences between calculation methodologies. There are some good examples (however, there are some mistakes in these, pages 32, 38 and maybe elsewhere) and the formulae for calculating the results. There doesn't appear to be that much on risk beyond the basic concept and introduction to the topic. In summary, a good general (and gentle) introduction to the glorious world of Performance Measurement, but after reading this you would probably need something more in-depth to expand on certain topics."
3,"Good breadth, less depth","If you are curious about the general breadth of issues related to measurement of investment return, this is a good book. There is a little less on risk. I personally would have liked more examples and math, more depth in general."
2,Mine was usable but be careful...poor packaging,"I already knew it would a cheap plastic adapter from the price, which is fine, but was surprised it was thrown into a large brown envelope for shipping. Obviously it bounced around and a number of plastic tabs were broken off the sides of the product. Also there are extra plastic parts for some models of cars, and one of those was completely broken in half. However what I needed was ok (in fact you have to break off certain plastic tabs for certain models) so I didn't even bother trying to get another one. Installed in my 2001 Ford Escape with no problems."
3,too small,"nice watch but very tiny dial, for my taste anyway. would have loved this watch if it was only a bit bigger."
1,Watch has stopped working,I have owned two Invitca watches. This one is the second one. Both watches have stopped working within 3 years of using (not battery problem as I have verified). I don't feel this is coincident. Invicta = unreliable. Bye-bye Invicta!
2,Mediocre Metal CD,Nothing to see here. Nothing to want either. Songs are boring. Mediocre Metal CD. I think the band invented a new genre: CRAP ROCK.
4,kavana,saw a video of him on Irish TV Bought it love it ...think he is a bit like Justin Timberlake when he was younger.
5,HE CAN MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD,My FIRST KAVANA CD PLAYED IT NON-STOP since the day i received it.Kavana is a white boy who sings R&B.He was popular in the late 90's but fadedRumors say he might be coming out with a cd later this year.Another rumor nothing to do with his music is that he is dating LuLu's Grandson. hmmmm
1,You can do better on your own!,"Please don't rely on these forms to run your business. They're missing the details that make such forms useful in the first place, and there's no fine print telling you to run them past counsel to see if they comply in your state. The terms of use say that you can only use the forms for ""personal or family use"" - so how can you use it for your business? It's clear that the makers didn't give this much thought, so spend a bit of your own time, then run it past a consultant or lawyer - or better yet, hire a consultant to do it for you. You've got better things to do than worry about forms."
3,I hate to be a spoilsport but...,"Callen's books have been so wonderful that I pre ordered this one and waited most impatiently. Guess that's why the disappointment was so huge. 'Spy' is your average regency stuff.Halfway through I contemplated tossing it but, although tedious, I managed to finish it. Just nothing special going on here. sorry, gc."
5,CALLEN'S WORK IS PURE GENIUS,"This book is truly wonderful! I've loved this writers' historicals from way back when she was writing Medievals, and I still love them when she writes in the VICTORIAN era, like this book. Callen's characters act appropriate for the era. This book is lush and well-researched as usual. I can't wait for her next book!!"
2,Inane Romance.. not recommended (D Grade),"This is one romance not to pick up. Unfortunately Callen has quite a few books written and this is not one to be recommended by the author. There is no chemisty between the heroine and hero and the whole spy drama is laughable.This review maybe a bit harsh and if you read this story, you will understand why. The writing is too simple and not at all interesting. The reader will probably not get through the first few chapters.Charlotte comes across as too whiny and a tad immature for a widow in her early twenties.Nick has no dimension. Not much more you can say about that.Katiebabs"
2,Bleh,"This sounded like such an exciting and passionate book, but I couldn't have found it more boring. I tried to feel bad for Charlotte, and I did a little, but she was just so irritating. She lied, she never listened to Nick and found herself in trouble at every turn, she was whiny, she thought she was helping them when she was just in the way - and Nick didn't seem to have much personality. The so-called case? Yawn...not even suspenseful. Do yourself a favor and skip this one by Callen."
4,Hits the ground running,The story starts off quickly and gets right into it. Moves quickly and keeps your attention. The characters are well written and endearing. Very impressed!
5,It really is incredible,"I've been looking for a high-quality body moisturizer and finally found one.Pros:-Light scent, so doesn't compete with my perfume as so many lotions do-Love the pump for convenience-Incredibly thick and rich-I been using it twice a day and saw a MAJOR improvement on the rough patches. My heels have never been this smoothCons:-Okay, I know I listed the thickness as a pro, and it is more of a pro than a con, but I find it's a bit difficult to spread-It's not inexpensive"
3,"Great lotion, shame about the smell","This is a very good lotion and I loved it when you could get the fragrance-free version. But if you're even a little sensitive to smelly products, then don't buy this! The ""fresh clean scent"" is overpowering. I'm giving away the bottle I bought to a friend and moving to another brand."
5,Exceeds Expectations,"This is the best lotion available on the market. I have extremely dry skin and live in a dry, desert climate, but using this lotion has changed my skin. It is easily absorbed and is the only lotion I don't have to reapply after every hand washing. It is thicker than regular lotion so it doesn't leave such a greasy mess. I have tried Aveeno, Cetaphyl, Jergyns, Vaseline brand, etc and never felt completely satisfied as I do with this product. Also, the fragrance is nice but does not irritate my sensitive skin. I couldn't have designed a better product myself. The only problem is keeping it in stock."
3,"Great product, Beware The Packaging!","We purchase this for my elderly mother. She has poor circulation in her legs and uses it to prevent sores. It works great, however as others have said the pump quits working long before the product is gone. I weighed what was left in a 14oz bottle when the pump quit and there was a full 6oz left. It is so thick you can't poor it out. I cut the bottle off above the product to get at what was remaining. So just be aware that if you throw it away when the pump quits you are throwing away almost half the product. I have made Gold Bond aware of this through their web site and am awaiting a responce."
4,Good experience with this product,"When we could no longer find it at discount stores, we turned to the Internet and found savings there. Satisfied with the product and the associated costs."
5,Healing your skin,"I bought this one for my husband and he loves it. It doesn't have too much fragrant smell , good for men to use. It really does heal the skin as they said. I suggest you put it on when your skin still a little wet , it works even better."
5,Favorite lotion of the moment.,"I have very dry hands. They crack, my cuticles are always raw and peeling. I need a heavy duty lotion to protect them. This is it. If I use it it really does the job. Best I have found, yet."
3,"Fine lotion, bad pump","It leaves at least 15-20% of lotion at the bottom. Which given the price of the lotion, I hate to waste. Yes, I can turn the bottle around and get some of it out. But I don't like to do it because it's very inconvenient.How hard is it to design a bottle that doesn't make you choose between inconvenience and waste?"
2,rip off container,this product is excellent. however the pumper container is designed so that one quarter of the product can not be retrieved due to a short extraction tube. for this reason i believe it is a ripoff.
2,It's junk,Skip this one and don't get tricked by the inexpensive price. It's junk. Powdery residue after it soaks in not to be confused with softness. For a buck more there are turns of other great products out there.
1,Dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals and carcinogens,Glad I researched about it early. This product has been classified to be containing dangerously high levels of toxic chemicals.Take a look here: http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/product/245057/Gold_Bond_Ultimate_Healing_Skin_Therapy_Lotion%2C_Aloe/
1,Greasy!,"Given that most of the other reviews here talk about this NOT being greasy, I must have gotten a bad bottle or something. I specifically bought it because of those comments but as soon as I put it on....ugh, grease city. It's been 5 minutes and after lots of hand rubbing, I still have a layer of grease on my hands.Update - it's now been 45 minutes and after lots of hand rubbing during that time, there's still just a layer of grease coating my hands. Lowered my rating from 2 stars to 1 star. This is going straight into the trash can."
2,Very Very Greasy,"Either the definition of greasy is a foreign concept to me, or this lotion is one of the greasiest lotions I've ever used. This lotion definitely absorbs into your skin, so much so that after washing your hands, it's still there. But it is SO greasy. If I touch anything somewhat glossy (e.g. the front surface of any smart phone or tablet) a good 15-20 minutes after applying, it will still leave really greasy smudge marks all over. I don't get that kind of smudging at all, with no lotion applied. It wouldn't surprise me if the ""greasiness"" actually contributes to better, softer skin. But it's definitely greasy. My hands also feel like they have a layer of wax on them after I apply this lotion (especially the back sides)."
5,Great for dry skin,Gold bond lotion is very great for dry skin. It keeps my skin feeling smooth and i don't feel any dryness.
5,The Real Deal,"Leonard Jacobson's writing reminds me of a friends observation - ""People with knowledge write books. People with wisdom write poetry"". Leonard has wisdom. Most pages have short paragraphs that carry an essential truth in a digestible form. If you like Ekhardt Tolle' you ought to read this. It's clearer and somehow communicates deeper."
2,Singing Pan,The pan we received generated a very high frequency pitch when used. Otherwise the pan worked as advertised.
4,Great Dvd,"I got this for my 78 yr old Mother in law for Christmas.She loved it. I loved it as well, but wish there were a few more songs on the cd that comes with it. Or only has 8 songs. But still love Josh."
4,A Young Josh,"The voice is pure. The songs are well done. At this stage of his career, his youthfulness shows up in the DVD in the awkwardness of the transitions between selections."
5,josh groban in concert,"First off, I received the item timely. Thanks to the seller. Secondly, the item was in great condition as described by the seller. Again, thanks. And thirdly, I have enjoyed the dvd and cd. Josh performs flawlessly. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,Absolutely beautiful!,"Josh Groban is an angel sent from heaven! There is nothing more beautiful than the sound of his voice. And to be able to watch him is just an added bonus! The DVD is great and it is nice to also have the live CD that comes along with it. If you are a fan, you will love it all and if you aren't, you will become one! Josh is the most amazingly talented man, and to hear that voice come out of someone so young is almost unbelievable! His music and voice will fill your soul with the most peaceful and beautiful feeling! He is one of a kind! You will see the passion in what he does when you watch him sing. You can't go wrong with this purchase!"
5,Can't stop listening,"I'm a big fan of Josh Groban's so this is a treat to see a concert. Seeing faces to names is a plus too -- his family, his fans, the people behind the whole production, musicians, etc. All the background info. What can I say; Josh could sing the alphabet and I'd be happy. I'd addicted to his voice."
5,Move over Julio,"I think my wife gave the greatest endorsement of this outstanding performance when she greeted seven songs during our first viewing with: ""Ooh!...this one is my favorite"". His songs celebrate the best of humanity. His voice makes mediocre songs sound magnificent. He appears totally at ease on stage, without the least pretension.I must say that this 60 year old prefers his classical and Broadway type pieces to the more electric rock concert style ones. I only hope that we do not lose him to the Pop producers.He has replaced Julio Iglesias as the unquestionable master of the multilingual romantic song.The video and audio of this DVD are excellent. They really made me want to upgrade my system. Overall, a superb work!"
5,"He sing like an Angel, his performance is wonderful.........",".....I never hear an angel singing before I see JOSH, I cann't describe the sensation that I feel when I see JOSH GROBAN singing, I feel like a MAGICAL PEACE sensation inside me. Is really amazing to see his beautiful young-face feeling each song, each word in this concert. I HIGH RECOMMENDED to hear jOSH in BAD DAYS, I use his CD's like a spiritual-food to my soul!!!!!"
4,Josh Groban's DVD,I ordered this because it came with the CD and I really like Josh Grobans voice but I ordered the DVD because my cousin is playing in the orchestra. I could do without the solo violin player in the DVD and didn't think that Ms. Scott matched Josh's voice in singing The Prayer.
2,Terrible Quality,"My wife only had this watch a few months before it started telling the wrong time. She had to take it into a watch repair shop and replace/fix some parts. A few months after that the strap broke! Never buying another Nike watch! They can do shoes, but that's about it.FYI, She does like the design so super glued the strap and she still wears this watch. This is why it gets 2 stars."
5,get it,"jindra is a highly trained professional dancer. she is lovely, elegant and a fantastic teacher.the other reviewer who complained about the counting must not understand that counting by a dance teacher is normal and expected in high level and professional dance lessons. the counting facilitates understanding of where the movement fits in with the music. perhaps the other reviewer does not understand how dance works with music in a numeric system.jindra has lovely posture and attention should be paid to the sections regarding posture. this is where you will learn to carry yourself as a dancer!over all, a great dvd. try it!"
4,very pretty,"definitely nice for a slim girl in a dress. nice craft and it has the words ""14K"" on it. At the price I paid for, it is a steal."
5,A true scholor and lover of swift,I strongly applaud this wonderful book. The author is a connoisseur and scholar of this writer and truely appreciates Swift's sharp satire. I recommend this book for all lovers of Swift. LL
4,The Other Voice,"Having used this text as an accompaniment to the Course in Miracles discussion guide, I purchased this book as a gift for our pastor. He, too, was delighted."
5,Absolutely wonderful!,"This book is a must for students of The Course in Miracles! Its clarity, its sincerity, its simplicity..... beyond words. I'm so glad I found this book and highly recommend it. If the words of the Course are sometimes confusing, this will certainly make things easier to understand! I can't wait for the next book to come out on the last chapters of the Course."
4,Leicester Bangs Review (2007):,"he Kamikaze Hearts - Oneida Road (Tangled Up!)Nodding respectfully to both Jay Farrar and Michael Stipe as they overtake on the outside, The Kamikaze Hearts seem well placed for `next big thing' status in the indie folk / alt. country stakes. Certainly a UK label helps - Tangled Up appears to be part of the well respected One Little Indian media empire - and this fine debut should speed matters along. Oneida Road does just about everything right.The ghost of Son Volt is roused on ""Ash Wednesday"" and equally so on ""No One called You A Failure'""and while they don't appear to display the lightness of touch of a Mark Olson, or Ryan Adams at his early peak, they do manage to instill the timelessness into their sound that only the very best of their chosen genre exhibit. A deft achievement, all round."
2,it's a 12-pack,"Amazon advertizes this as a 24-pack. It's really a 12-pack. Of course, each joiner plate has two halves, which is why some brainiac called it a 24-pack....Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do. I don't know why they made these things out of plastic, though. Eventually, they'll break if they're load bearing."
3,good mill - but best feature is also biggest flaw.,"These Vic Firth mills are beautifully lacquered, shapely, not too huge, and they are easy to fill and use. I bought one because of the colors and shiny surface. The mills look just great in the kitchen. However, I had to order three from Amazon before I recieved one that wasn't damaged on one of the edges, with a sizeable ding or chip in the lacquer that revealed the wood underneath.Once I got one that was not damaged, I saw that even under my own careful custody, the edge soon chipped, with wood exposed.The shiny paint is the reason I bought it in the first place, but I have treated it quite carefully and it still chipped. So it's a tradeoff. If you aren't bothered by the appearance, it's a fine, working mill."
1,Don't buy for Kindle,"Meditation: Achieving Inner Peace and Tranquility In Your Life (Little Books and CDs)Do not purchase this for Kindle because the meditation part is just read straight to you with no pauses or, reader inflection. Ugh! Waste of my money!!! Very tiny bit of information in book part then the meditation read by Kindle not by author. Just buyer beware. No negative reflection on the author just the Kindle processing of audible content. Amazon can take this Kindle book back!"
3,Disapointed,"Ordered via Amazon because it not available on Kindle & because I wanted the CD, unfortunately it came without the CD and now I'm told CD not available. Still working with World Books"
5,Mediation: Achieving Inner Peace & Tranquility in your life,It was wonderful. It teaches you how to meditate. I tell my patients about it to help reduce stress.
5,Excellent Meditation,Both the book and the CD with the guided meditation are excellent. The meditation takes one literally out of the body into the universe. An incredible sensation even for one who has meditated during many years. Thank you Brian for your knowledge and wisdom. Delivery was rather slow though).Meditation: Achieving Inner Peace and Tranquility In Your Life (Little Books and CDs)
5,Love this!,He does a wonderful job of talking you through the meditation. The book that accompanies it is a good quick read.
5,The best!,"This is absolutely the best meditation CD I have ever tried! Amazing, it works wonderfully."
4,CD Meditation too fast...slow down,"I bought this book mainly for the meditation cd and it is a good one if only he would slow down. The visualization is fantastic but I feel like I want to say ""wait a minute, I'm not there yet"". His voice is calm and soothing and this would be one of my favorite meditation tapes if the pace was slower. The book itself was short and sweet but I enjoyed it."
1,Disappointed,"Enjoyed the written part on my Kindle, the written CD is useless... We could have received a CD in the mail we paid enough to have one. I would have to buy another book to get aCD."
3,A very OK look,"I had to order these ties at the last minute for my wedding, and they showed up in a very timely manner. The color was NOT what we were looking for, but that's the risk you take with ordering anything online. But we made the most of it...they're a nice color if this shade of red is part of your color pallet."
5,a MUST read!,"Schoeneman's fantastic expose is as FUN! as it is smart, satirical and real. The parties, rumors and glitzy indulgence of NYC's most- popular will keep you turning the pages as fast as you can!"
1,"should be glamorous, merely dull.","This novel is virtually unreadable. There is too much exposition, and of a sort that makes me think that every character (and every quip) is a thinly veiled and unimaginatively retold from the author's own life -- invented characters would not be nearly so dull or indistinct. It's unfortunate because there probably is a rich vein of story here, but the depths have been left undisturbed.She's certainly been there, but lacks the skill bring her life to life on the page, and has little perspective or irony to offer in the telling. Thoroughly dissapointing."
2,Not my favorite,"I just couldn't get into this book. I really wanted to like it, it just fell short for me."
4,Eye-opening look at the 'quid pro quo' nature of the gossip game,"""4% Famous"" is a book I suspect I'd like and appreciate more were I more attuned to the NYC gossip scene. Given Deborah Schoeneman inside-ish background to these rarefied circles, it's a fair bet that much of what she spools out here in 269 quickly and eagerly consumed pages draws very deeply from actual goings on reported by New York magazine during her tenure there. But even without that level of knowledge, I thought ""4% Famous"" was a compelling and enlightening read. I say 'enlightening' because of the way it lays bare the gossip game, especially - as one of the professional reviews on this page notes - its 'quid pro quo' nature. Watching the horse-trading of items so each writer could protect their respective interests was eye-opening."
1,Disappointing!!,Disappointing recording!There is still a long ways to go before this artist can display any depth of Indian music!
3,Haven't heard it yet!,"I purchased ""Anourag"" today, but haven't opened it yet. I decided to read the reviews on this site first. The reviews are either highly favorable or very negative. It seems that the negative reviews have all been submitted by people with Indian names. I am wondering if their knowledge and understanding of the complexities of Indian music is really so much greater than that of anyone else listening to, and evaluating this music. I have heard Ravi and Anoushka Shankar play together, in person, on two occasions, and both concerts were wonderful."
3,"No more ""Beginner's Mind""","This review will probably differ from the majority, but I hear something really important lost... call it ""Beginner's Mind,"" or a certain openness to experimentation and freeform musicianship... I don't know what it is, only that Anoushka's first release seems so much 'better'. Here she tries getting fancy, this music has ""attitude"" and seems to have lost the simple groundedness of the original, although likely it will appeal to a much broader audience. Indeed, it seems to be *trying* to ""appeal"" and thereby loses all its appeal (to me). Perhaps it was inevitable -- ""followups"" are never the same as the original (most evident in films, but it can be noticed in music as well).I may be alone in this point of view, but this is an honest review from the heart, and after purchasing this CD I recommend it only if you consider 'fanciness', 'attitude' and 'mass appeal' to be 'improvements'. Otherwise, try the original!"
5,Outstanding complete guide,"As an MBA with strong marketing orientation and small business owner and marketer, I was interested to see how detailed and complete this book was relative to the topic. I was pleasantly surprised and reminded of some aspects I had forgotten, and learned somethings (my real motive for purchasing).As an educator, I was concerned about how hard it would be to read and understand. The authors have done an outstanding job in this area as well.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who operates a business or is interested in marketing techniques and strategies."
1,"Rattle's Clinker (Simon says, ""Hold Your Nose!"")","Okay, I'll bite...In an alternate universe, one wonders what Duke and Stray might have given us if they adapted Brahms, Mahler and Beethoven symphonies for their orchestra.EKE's original long form compositions are true works of genius. Note Ellington Suites written for the Queen England in 1959 or his clever, uncompromising jazz nod to Tchaikovsky in ""Arabesque Cookie"" and Grieg's ""Peer Gynt"".There are conductors who could handle a project like this credibly: Andre Previn, Gunther Schuller? That said, and despite heroic efforts of soloists both gifted and renown, nothing can save Sir Rattle and his orchestra (Cough, ""band""). They are out of their element and beyond redemption on this album.One star because Clark Terry is so beautiful. Nothing he contributes to can be all bad."
1,This is gift wrap NOT a book,"I wish I had read the reviews before I ordered this item. It looks like Amazon.com has not read the reviews or they would have known there was a problem with their item description. The gift wrap is pretty, but not the type of thing I buy."
4,on time but diferent,"the sunglasses was not gradient violet, it was the RB 4081 710/13 3N which is brown. but we like the color anyway."
3,Closetmaid pole caps,"The items arrived quickly; however, one end cap was broken. As luck would have it, there was an extra in one of the Closetmaid systems I ordered, so it worked out ok."
1,Not 15ft cable - 6ft cable instead,"I just placed the order. They contacted me 3 hours later to tell me that it was a print error and that it is actually a 6 foot cable. They offered to refund my money or ship me a 6 foot cable:""I have problem with your order, Power Cord - 15 Feet.""""15-Feet is not in stock, it should have been 6-Feet, it was listed by my mistake.""""How should I process your order?""""I can issue a immediate refund or I can ship 6-Feet Power Cord by 2nd Day Air (USPS Priority Mail).""""Sorry for you inconvenience and thank you for your order.""If this is the wrong part or the wrong price for the right part, they need to fix it now that they know that it is wrong.I appreciate the fact that they did not just ship me the wrong part and that they contacted me as soon as they learned of their error.I will now look for the ""right"" part.Note: They cancelled my order immediately upon my request - another positive for the vendor"
3,Hard to follow at times. No real ending.,I loved Grace Jordan's Life Below Hells Canyon and wanted to read more of her books. This one had its ups and downs. I found it hard to get into initially but then began to enjoy it. Names of characters were similiar and were hard to distinguish at times. Was disappointed at the ending as it really left alot hanging like there was going to be a sequel but there's not. Not a bad read but not a terrific one either.
1,Deserves 0 stars,"I would give this book zero stars, but the minimum was one. I use it only when I have to and refer to Schaum's Thermodynamics Outline for all concepts. My Professor uses this book and the average grade in the class has been an F without curving. The book is organized chaos!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"If you're the head of a university, don't get this book at all! You're students will loathe it. If you're a student looking for a study aid-think again, this book is simply terrible.Sandler has no idea how to put what he knows into a manner that undergrads will understand, not at all. Save yourself a heart attack and look somewhere else for a thermo book."
3,Overly Tedious for Undergraduate Use,"I used this book in my undergraduate Thermodynamics classes. While it is detailed and thorough, I had a very difficult time learning from it. The example problems are not particularly illuminating, at least for the problem-solving approach most engineers desire, and the approach is overly precise for undergraduate use. I also had a hard time finding what I was looking for when I picked it up to reference. I bought an older version of Smith and Van Ness' Thermodynamics book, and I usually use that for reference now. If you are looking for a precise, rigorous textbook, this is for you. If you want a book more geared towards problem solving, buy Smith and Van Ness."
2,Not for the undergrad!!!!!!,It always gets to me why university professors think they have to assign an upper-grad level book to undergrads students because their doing a favor for their collegue (author) instead of thinking toward their students. This book is definetly an upper grad level book. It has few examples and is written at a level that is not introductory. I'm not saying this isn't a good book but what I'm saying is it's NOT for the undergraduate student. Professors need to think of their students first!!!!!! The 2 stars are rated toward undergrad level.
2,Not for students who are starting out in thermo,"This book is really complex and not helpful to learn from if you've never taken (or briefly taken) thermodynamics before. You definitely need the teacher to explain what is going on in the book (which mine doesn't so relying on the book doesn't help). The problems are mostly different from the examples in the book and definitely not straightforward at all (I would not have been able to solve some of the problems if my teacher didn't show me how to do them because some are tricky and you need to know little tricks here and there). Furthermore, if you are one of those persons that needs to see almost every step to solving problems, this book skips quite a bit of steps and leaves you wondering how they got there. It would be a great book if you already know thermodynamics and are a graduate student. For those taking thermo (for some crazy requisite, like I need to despite the fact that I'm in environmental engineering) not a good textbook."
2,Bringing chaos to order,"Reading this book is like peeling an onion in that it has no well defined core. It is also like walking into a jungle without a map since it is so badly organized. His skill for manipulating equations is marginal, making things even worse. In a few places, the author confuses a necessary condition with a sufficient condition. The book also contains many logical and conceptual errors. It would have hit the garbage a long time ago if it wasn't a textbook.Having said that, the book has several good sections in it, along with a wealth of information, if you know what (and where) you are looking for. Most of basic elements are in the book. But, you have to know how to weave a coherent story out of them in order to benefit from the book. I should add that problems at the end of each chapter are quite good."
3,Very dense and rapid upper level thermodynamics textbook,"This book is extremely dense and hard to follow. It is also not a good introductory thermodynamics book, but suited to grad/phd level multi-phase/component thermodynamics. It is missing details and derivations, which make it hard to follow the progression of the book. Expect to need a supplemental explanation of topics covered in it."
1,"Cheap, waste of money","My grandson took this out of the box and within seconds, it cracked. It is cheap, poorly made and has no soft liners on the inside."
4,"A great, relatively unknown, session","Not sure what the other reviewer means by short cuts, because none is less than almost 7 minutes in duration, with three logging in at over 9 minutes:Autumn Leaves 7:59So What 6:42All Blues 10:25I thought about U 7:26'Round Midnight 9:07Davis 7:03My Funny Valentine 9:33Dear Old Stockholm 7:30Not every horn player plays on each cut, so there is plenty of solo room for Nick Payton, George Coleman, Roy Hargrove, Grover, Eddie Henderson, Joe Locke, Benny Golson. The rhythm section stays consistent-- Jackie Byard, Ron Carter and Ed Thigpen (a fantastic section).The playing is all ""top shelf"" by a combination of seasoned vets and younger newcomers at the time (Nick, Roy and Joe). Must have been fun for all of them and it shows on this disc.Highly recommended."
2,not so great,"Pretty enough, but impossible to control the size of the grind which pretty much varies from half corn to fine and anywhere in between. Does not hold much inside and you need to go and get a pair of pliers every time you need to refill it since the retaining nut somehow becomes screwed on very tightly by itself with normal use.Would give this product line a pass since the grind mechanism is probably the same for all."
3,"Pretty good, not great","I actually picked this one up from a half-price table. I'm more of a ""like a love story in my sci/fi-fantasy"" novels than a ""like sci/fi-fantasy in my romance"" novels kind of reader so that might be why I found it a tad on the light and frothy side. (Not enough pages for a gal used to trilogies!) Not a bad book at all though, I'm glad I bought it."
1,Lousy ink.,"The result of this ""bubble gum pink"" was to produce an essentially off-white look with a very very soft shade of pink. This is not what I expected from a ""bubble gum pink"". I will only use the product now if I want to start with an off-white look for a base before adding other colors. As an aside, I am a real fan of Jacquard products so I view this color as an anomaly (it happens!)."
5,A thinking persons version of James dean.,"I gave a copy of the book to my daughter,some stories never get old, this was a fresh new spin,on James Dean, it is a well written, and tho a ""bleak""look at his life, it was told very heart warming and honest.You can't put it down."
1,What a waste of time,Ever forced yourself to finish something you've started in the hopes that it might get better?That was me with this book. Bought it based off the cover art and the synopsis. If only the guy that wrote the synopsis had written the book. Words fail to describe the total waste of time finishing this book. The author is jumping all over different time periods and leaving it up to the reader to decide when something is taking place in the past or present.I was hoping for at least some suspense or maybe even horror. I was disappointed.If this won the Bram Stroker Award nothing else was offered.
1,Spoiler please!,"Peter Straub, Ramsey Campbell,T M Wright- they write complex but you can understand them. This book is impossibley complex. Who was main hero, why he did not recognize his own address on parcel? who was dog that came to his home? who was the old guy in the begining? I missed a lot. please - auther or someone - write review with note: ' this is spoiler' and EXPLAIN everything."
2,Who are the Keepers again? I'm still confused.....,"Well, I bought this book because the author, basically, lives right around the corner (so to speak). I read the first part with gusto and then I started to lose interest.....and after forcing myself to finish the book I find I am STILL CONFUSED! (never a good thing)..... I thought the writing was good, the characters were developed well, but there was just something missing all the way through which I hoped would be clear by the end of the novel. I was wrong! I also had a very difficult time imagining all the creatures in the basement of the Keepers facility...it just didn't ring true for me. PLEASE .... SOMEONE.... post a review and let me know who the Keepers really are?"
4,Keepers,"This was a great read...full of twists and turns, it keeps you going until the last page! I see this one being turned into a film someday. A littl sci-fi, a big helping of horror, The Island of Dr Moreau meets Donnie Darko. Good book."
1,Runs Out of Gas Too Soon,"Keepers starts well with the main character seeing a man mortally injured in traffic. Then it bogs down in repressed memories and a subplot with an autistic nephew who seems to have wandered in from King's DREAMCATCHER.The nephew draws detailed graphic novels (they're not called comic books any more) that anticipate things that are happening in real life.Finally the story wanders into fantasy with no surprises. Worse yet, none of the characters were well enough developed that I'd care what happens to them.Worse yet is the nature of the Keepers. Braunbeck seems unsure of just what to do with them. Sometimes they seem benevolent, sometimes they seem menacing. But I never believed them so their nature was unimportant.KEEPERS reads like a junior novel for preteens that's been rewritten to be passed of on adults. At least I bought a used copy so I didn't get rooked for full price."
2,"No real characterization, thin plot","So very little happens in this book. The whole thing is just ""fight a bunch of monsters, make camp, fight some more monsters, go back to town, fight some more monsters"". Seriously, it's a book version of the game Baldur's Gate. I know that it is a book written off of a D&D module, but, to me, there ought to at least be a story outside of [fight] & slash, rest, [fight] & slash. There is just the tiniest hinting at developing the characters and even then, it is just to define them as a certain ...type. The only reason I even bothered to give it 2 stars was because the combat is decently written. It was a fast read and not entirely unenjoyable, but I would not recommend this book to anyone who had not played the module."
2,Cookie Cutter Fantasy,Instead of breathing life into these old modules they make flesh them out with predictable plots and one-dimensional characters. So much more could have been done with this book that one small review cannot cover even a 10th.
3,Review,"It's an interesting concept to write books about classic modules. I purchased ""Keep"" because I felt I would relive old memories from when I played it. However, the characters in the book did things a lot differently than we did so many years ago and the nostalgia just wasn't there. However, it's not a bad read, just not what I expected."
4,CHECK-IN CHECK OUT,THIS IS IS WELL WRITTEN BOOK IT COVERS ALL THE ISSUES ABOUT RUNNING A HOTEL/MOTEL.I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY HELPFUL.
3,I wanted this to work so bad...,"... but it never did on my nikon D40 w/ SB-400. I dorked with it for several hours, trying every setting in an attempt to get it working. If you get the camera into iTTL control mode for the flash it will make the flash go off but never quite in sync with the shutter resulting in a dark photo everytime. bummer :( Sometimes it doesn't pay to be cheap. Someday I hope to shell out for the nikon equivalent since off camera flash is rad.Update: Works great with my D7000!!"
5,Contents...,"An amusing commentary on man's sexual cunning and woman's gullibility.The man in this case is Devlin Birchfield, ""The Grasshopper,"" extraordinarily good looking and a self-styled sexual superman. The woman is not one but many: various inhabitants...young and old, attractive and not, passionate and cold...of a quiet residential town. One autumn Devlin leaves his hermitage in the wild woods and invades this town for the winter, there to seduce woman after woman.But when spring comes, and Devlin is ready to return to the woods, civilized society, to which he has so kindly and skillfully introduced the joys of the flesh, makes it ultimate demand upon him...that he be sacrificed.Funny, fresh, delightful and ingenious."
4,safe arrival of Charlie Byrd,"The Cd arrived promptly and in excellent condition....this Cd is a re issue of a LP I had many years ago, and I was thrilled to reaquaint my ears with the wonderful Charlie Byrd...thank you!Pamela Ferguson (Melbourne,Australia)"
5,entralling story,"Even though the reader knows in advance how the narrative turns out,the details make it interesting. Thye Portuguese did their leg work.They had sent spies to the near East and the Far East. This spice comesfrom here. That spice comes from there. They knew precisely what they weregoing to do. Cut out the middlemen, Muslims, Venetians, and everybody else.So the dash from the Cape to India was merely the culmination of a plan thattook more than a cdentury to pull off."
2,What about parents?,"I am a HUGE Cussler fan, but Clive, you got lost in the story. The storyline concept is interesting, the characters could use more development (which is usually a Cussler strength). However, reading the book through the eyes of a parent, I wonder what the story teaches young children when the concept is to lie to your parents and run away from home in order to achieve an adventure with no consequences?"
5,Recieved The Adventures of Vin Fiz,Arrived in great condition. This is a Christmas Gift. I am sure that my Grandson will love it. Thank you.
4,"Very Good, Worth Reading, But...","I can understand why Lucas loved/hated Emma, but to leave the entire country? For seven years? A bit extreme to me. Lucas didn't know he was wrong about Emma simply because he refused to ever speak to her again. Which was unfortunate. Just goes to show that unforgiveness isn't always the wisest course of action. In truth, Emma was a brave, selfless, honorable woman, not to mention very beautiful.The story was interesting all the way through, but a couple of things bothered me. First, Lucas almost came across as a ""mama's boy."" Then, when he found out who had attacked Emma, in his thoughts he displayed compassion, understanding, outrage on her behalf, and remorse and guilt for all that he'd put her through. Then he blew it when he said to himself, ""____ had had her first."" How appalling."
2,"Good Evans, It Doesn't Getz Any Worse Than This.","First of all, excuse my horrible and tasteless puns. Do yourself a favor, and don't sink to a lower level by purchasing this album. As both a jazz listener and performer, Getz and Bill Evans are my two favorite jazz artists. This album remains the biggest disappointment out of my entire Getz collection of 20+ CDs; the same goes for my Bill Evans collection. I really don't know what the other reviewers are thinking here. Getz's solos on the disc are clearly uninspired and don't even come close to revealing his uncanny mastery. Obviously, Evans and Getz still play well--but not nearly at the level they do on a host of other albums. Pick up ""Getz and JJ at the Opera House"", or Bill Evans' double-self-overdubbed ""Conversations With Myself"". Both are on the impeccable Verve label, and are a far better way to spend your money."
3,"Interesting, but not up to the '64 Album","In the liner notes of this release, the critic notes that both Evans and Getz had been disappointed in their '64 studio collaborationStan Getz & Bill Evans. As a result, that album was shelved and then finally released in '74. The general tone of the liner notes is that on these live recordings, Evans and Getz finally achieved the chemistry that was lacking before (interesting, since Evans becomes disgusted and completely drops out of the second track, Stan's Blues). Nonetheless, the Grandfather's Waltz on this album is nicely stretched out compared with the original.What really puts me on the side of the '64 album is the long stretch of ballads that starts from But Beautiful and ends with Loverman. Elvin Jones's performance on the '64 album really lights a fire under their asses, and you end up with a much punchier set of recordings."
1,Save yourself the trouble...,"This may in fact be the worst book I've ever purchased.Fully 80% of the 'projects' are ""cut a piece of pipe, put a cap on it, and place it over something sharp"" The other 20% are ""cut a piece of pipe, put a cap on it, screw it to the wall and put things in it""The 'furniture' portion of the book (which is what I was really after) says ""pvc furniture is so popular that you should check your local hardware store for specialty joints and designs""There are /no/ scale drawings/plans, just the occasional drawing of a piece of pipe with a cap on it.I was unable to find anything in this book that was useful to me, and nothing that was any more complex than 'holder' or 'cover'."
2,Disappointed,"There are some good ideas in this book, but many projects were not completed with a few simple sketches or explanations. Also too many of the projects were useless ideas. I also bought one for my daughter and she came to the same conclusion as I did. She said ""Dad I think you wasted your money"".I think a thoughtful rewrite of this book would make it a winner as both my daughter and I have seen many other good uses for PVC pipe."
4,Ignore DLA2's review!,"This is a really good book. I don't know why DLA2 reviewer was so negative. He complains because the book is simple and easy to understand? hey, building with PVC pipe is not rocket science! Sanders includes many useful designs and all info that is needed to build them. While not as good (it IS good, just has a narrower appeal) as his previous book, The Self Reliant Homesteader, PVC Project Book is well worth the purhcase price, and a solid second book for the author."
1,Save your money,This is a fine book to give to a ten year old or perhaps some cub scouts. It might be to simple for them. I am terribly disappointed.
1,PVC book,The book didn't help me at all it is out dated I needed sizes and lengths not ideas I would not tell people to buy it
3,Some Good Ideas,"This book has some fun ideas for helpful everyday projects made from PVC. The introduction gives helpful information on the history of PVC and plastics in general, and gives advice on working with the different kinds of PVC. The book would be improved, however, if there were photos of every project described, and if there were detailed lists of the parts for each project. Nevertheless, I found that the projects described led me to think of other uses for PVC. For the price, it is a useful book."
5,Perfect fit!,This ring goes perfectly with the multi-stone ring I ordered from the same seller. The silver band doesn't just flake away and turn my finger green like cheat rings do. It's a lovely ring that I will keep and wear for years! It's good enough quality to wear all the time!
4,Beautiful Ring,"I brought this ring as a gift to myself and I love it. Garnet is my birthstone. The stones are a little redder than I like...almost like a ruby, but it's still a beautiful ring for the price."
2,"Looks nice, but didn't last","This is a very pretty watch. The face is a little big for a woman's wrist, but still looks delicate enough. 3 weeks after I got it there was a huge crack across the crystal though, so it had a pretty short life."
2,They don't fit!,"The Groovy Girls clothes are so cute, but they don't fit the dolls! They are too tight which makes the velcro closure constantly come apart."
1,What is going on here?,"The amazon people should be ashamed of themselves. They are obviously trying to trick people into buying this video under the impression that they are getting the jack nicholson movie. Key evidence: look at the list of ""other dvd's these customers bought"" - they're all feature films. This product is an instructional video. And I would love if someone could explain to me why it's $90 for an instructional video that is only 21 minutes long. How on earth can something that short in length be so much money? I also like how they advertise ""buy together with Adam Sandler's Anger management for only $110"". What? What?! That's not a deal. I damn near wet my pants when I saw this total debacle. Buyer beware - either that, or just ask yourself ""Why is something that stars Adam Sandler $90?"""
3,Not the Adam Sandler-Jack Nicholson movie!,"Don't look here if you want the Adam Sandler-Jack Nicholson theatrical feature. This ""Anger Management"" is a 21-minute instructional DVD. Perhaps Sandler could have used this before he had to see Jack..."
3,Too sweet-- needs flavor.,"way too sweet. I love Betty Lou's products but this was a rare disapointment. Way too sweet, with not enough blueberry flavor."
1,"Cute Vans, poor quality!","These have held up well, better than some of the other plan city vehicles we have purchased. Wish they had an ice cream truck though. Thought that would be a better choice over a bank truck.Update, these only lasted a few months past the initial review and when I contacted Plan Toys to talk about quality issues and replacement parts I got the cold shoulder. . . .so much for my love affair with plan toys! I am desperate to find good ""green"" toys for my child, but when a company can't give me the time of day to try to replace busted wheels then I guess its time to call it quits! The idea of wooden toys is great if they last longer than their plastic counterparts. . . ."
3,Nostalgia ain't enough,"After playing it I realized that these songs have been done much better by other musicians and this really served as a portal to more hard core traditional folk music for me. It is nice to have ""Mole's Moan"" which was just everywhere you turned in Boston at the time. Unfortunately that time as expressed on this set is dated."
1,PUT ME IN A COMA,"might be time to hang it up, Tom. Unbelievably dated and boring. The absolute worst version of ""San Francisco Bay Blues""."
5,A Doozy of a Duo,"A Very cheap and Perfect way to waste 3 hours. Double Lorenzo Lamas (Snakeater Series), enough said. Check out Raptor Island as well, if your into nonsense."
2,Bad language and bad acting.,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
4,Fobus holster for SP-101,"The material this holster is made of appears very durable. It will likely last a considerable period. The weapon fits into the holster perfectly and smoothly. With proper adjustment of tension, the holster with weapon can be turned upside down and shaken without the weapon falling out. Yet when mounted in the customary fashion the weapon is easily withdrawn. The trigger is completely covered.It is slightly difficult to mount on a 1 3/4 inch gun belt. There are two sets of belt slots. One set accommodates belts up to 1 1/2 inches and the other belts up to 1 7/8 inches. The holster clasps the belt tightly so that it does not easily slide from its intended position.This model does not have provision to change the angle the holster is mounted. It is mounted at about a 90 degree angle which can be uncomfortable for some especially if a cross side draw is used."
3,Range holster.,"This is a well made holster.... for the range. It fits nicely on a belt but if you want to have a fast draw this is not the type of holster you want. When you go to draw the gun out the holster comes up with it. It does not have something to hold down the holster itself. I receantly took it to the range and in order to pull the gun out I had to use two hands. It fits nice and snug just like advertised with an ajustment screw. I thought that I must be doing something wrong because the holster kept coming up(so I read the instructions that comes on the package it was shipped in, I know who reads instructions for a holster right?)the instructions were for a paddle holster and not for the belt holster, so for the range I think it will do the job if you dont mind holding it down while you draw.For the price I guess you really cant complain after all you get what you pay for right!"
3,Hard to use,"Had a hard time figuring out how to get my gun out. Had to stop using this holster when I installed laser sight grips, it didn't fit anymore."
3,nice fit - not sturdy,"These have a nice fit, but I think they already have a small run. but other than that.. I'm full hipped and these fit comfortably."
5,Optimism via science and philosophy,"This is a fine example of intelligent but accessible writing in which science, philosophy and theory combine to inspire hope. Dr. Skutch has studied aggression and behavior of avian species,and he has witnessed a great deal of destruction in Meso-America. Amazingly, he is able to use his experience to illustrate a path for harmony in contemporary society. I may not agree with every detail, but his overall concepts and optimistic viewpoint are compelling and worthy of serious study by anyone concerned with our planet's future."
3,What were they thinking?,"I have seen this cartoon when it firsted aired on Fox and I was disappointed in it. It is not what you'ld expect from two people who put on an outstanding show every night. The premise of the cartoon is two travellers who try to restore the magic to Sarmoti. However, someone put in too many references to mythology, legends, and fairy tales. In my opinion, this took away from the cartoon and it made me wonder if the writer wrote it 5 minutes before they did the show. It was majorly disappointing that Siegfried and Roy did not do their own voices. I guess they thought that it stunk, too. As far as the videotape goes, they edited the hell out of it, so much that scenes are missing from it. The only way to notice this is if you have seen it on tv first. The best part of the cartoon is when you see pieces of their stage show at the end. I recommend that you get this tape only if you are a fan of theirs because it isn't all that great to watch."
3,Masters of the ... eh? Slightly Interesting,"To be Honest, I've never been a big fan of Siegfried & Roy. I just remember watching this when it came out on TV and seeing those creepy Specters, Greed, Envy, and Pride. they instantly hit me as awesome, and I knew I had to see them again.also the voice acting was top notch, and stilt's comic relief played off well. anywho, the special is pretty cool, and I think it came out at the right time, another reason the '90s rocked."
4,Endangered Recipes: Too Good to be Forgotten,"I love collecting recipe books and I find so many of the ""nearly forgotten"" recipes are really great. I love experimenting with them."
1,Endangered recipes - not!,"I was disappointed in this book. I doubt that I will ever make any of these dishes - none of them seem ""endangered"" to me."
5,Great early recording,"I should of course first disclose that I do not know very much about classical music, but as far as I can tell this is a fantastic recording.This 3-cd set is a reissue of the early classical recordings that Vanessa-Mae made before crossing over into pop. It is a fantastic set because it offers a wide range of music: Tchaaikovsky, Kreisler, Beethoven, Paganini, Sarasate, Bach, Brahms and others. Vanessa-Mae's playing is fantastic throughout. I have always felt that she is a much stronger classical than pop player -- she really does not bring much uniqueness to pop music (just electronic supporting instruments) -- however, her remarkable classical mastery is easily evident even to an inexperienced person like me.All-in-all, the recording is remarkably mature and holds up well in comparison to VM's later classical recordings. Most highly recommended!"
4,Fiddle Safe and Sound,"The Backpack case solves my concerns about my fiddle and bow really well, and I can carry the case by hand or strap it on my back while i carry my guitar at the same time. The set-up is a little heavier than I thought it would be, but I think the protection factor for the fiddle is worth it. There is enough room on the inside of the case under the neck to store the shoulder rest without changing it, which is great! I think the whole thing is well-made, and expect it to last a long time. Definitely worth the price."
3,Could be half the number of pages...,"I would not say the book is not good at all. But the information could be passed in very less pages. There are lots of repetitive sayings. Too many vague and generic assumptions and advises. I wouldn't consider it as a 'how-to'. At most, a very general guidance to managers. Definitively is not for the technical team in the project."
2,disappointing,"From the reviews, I thought I would love this book. After 40 pgs I found this book to be choppy and disconnected. What about all the french in there that most people would not understand. I did not care for it and did not finish reading it."
4,One of the best how-to guide on valuation,"This is one of the most complete books on valuation in the market. The others are Valuation from Copeland and Damodaran on Valuation.It contains concepts and technicalities, such as CFROI, PEG or how to include management options in valuation, not found in other books -though I rather that he expanded more on this-.The only drawbacks I find in Damodaran books are the limited attention to real-world balance sheet problems one may face (ie: effects of Minority Interests in valuation) and the no-mention policy for valuing banks. In this category, Copeland's Valuation book is better. Of course, this particular book is only meant to value tech firms !!!If you want a really in-depth valuation book, just buy it."
5,Customer,The product was very good. Alot cheaper than in the stores. And it was exactly the same thing. Im using it now and have no problems with it.
5,excellent grill pan,"wonderful grill pan. I grill everything on it. Nothing sticks to it, it's very easy to wash. The only thing I'm not happy about, it doesn't come with the lid which I would love to have."
5,Perfect Size Little Pan,"We purchased this pan for its size and for the ridges in the bottom. Our explicit use is for cooking bacon and while we are sure it works for plenty of other things it works perfectly for our bacon mornings! It also works really well for omelets too but for us it was a no brainer to buy because the standard pans are just too small to cook any decent size portion of bacon. FYI, the ridges also help keep the whatever you are making from burning. Either way if you're looking for a good pan to cook up some bacon look no further. As an aside, the pan is very light and almost seems flimsy but our opinion is that it's just a light pan that does its job well."
1,This is NOT Calphalon Professional,"I foolishly bought this & was very disappointed. The stem handle is sharp on the under side, being a fold-over design which is uncomfortable to hold. Also, the pan was not level so even heating was impossible. I sent it back immediately.It felt cheap, it did not say Calphalon anywhere, as said by another reviewer, not the packaging box or the pan had any identifiers. What WAS included was a pamphlet on how to care for Calphalon products in general, nothing specific to this pan, nor was there a guarantee on the packaging, which is found on true Calphalon pans. To see what a real Calpahlon grill pan looks like, go to Williams Sonoma or the Calphalon websites. That item looks little like this one advertised on Amazon but does have the identifying marks on the quality handle and a guarantee.Don't buy this cheap pan, find the quality true product somewhere else."
2,Too simplistic,Bought this book since it was a stand-alone book on Jesus entering Jerusalem for that season where we were talking about it at church. Was very disappointed. It is so simplistic that it misses the story.
4,Spider-man 3 wall hanging web,"If you have a Spider-man 3 (dark Spidey) fan in your family, this is the toy for them. However, if the arms are bent too far up, they will snap off. I have now gotten 4 of these for my grandson because he keeps breaking the arms. Nevertheless, it is still his favorite toy by far."
2,Hasbro doesnt quiete cut it with Spidey 3!,"Im a big movie figure collector. From DC to Marvel. But this time when I bought the first Spidey 3 figures, I was dissapointed. Toy Biz made the first 2 movies better; more realistic, and bigger. These figures are much smaller. Hasbro has to step it up, if they want the 4th Film."
1,Which Brief Encounter?,"With all due respect to the last writer, I find that review absolutely incredible. It's more than that - it is ridiculous; unless of course he/she is refering to the original B/W 1940s Brief Encounter starring Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson. That was a classic. Is the reviewer aware that he/she has lavished praise on the 1970s version with Richard Burton and Sophie Loren? Oh yes, it's a nice enough love story - in a daytime soapy sort of way. But it also happens to be the worst remake in the entire history of remakes!"
4,Skagged!,"I greatly enjoyed this CD except for the last two cuts, ""Kitty Magennis"" and ""Christmas Time's A'Comin'.""""Kitty Magennis"" seemed too bland and didn't have anything to recommend it. The presence of the Ricky Skaggs song felt like an attempt to make the CD more ""Christmassy."" Its inclusion in the collection felt like an afterthought or a ""throwaway"" cut."
1,great description of the bracelet!,"bicone, cool blue waves, swirls--I love the description! It makes the bracelet sound like the perfect vacation!"
5,Good first album!,Really nice first album by Bay Area (California) artist David Franklin which features songs written from the heart. Nice guitars and melodies make this a wonderful collection of songs.
1,WARNING: CONTAINS LARD,"Yes, I grew up with these too. I was going to purchase some for old time's sake and checked the website. Contains lard. In this day of heart and cholesterol awareness, I'm surprised that this is still the case. It shouldn't be that difficult to change the recipe slightly to eliminate lard, and call it a vegetarian friendly product."
1,Wha?,"HOW ON EARTH do they think a package of corn muffin mix that sells for under two dollars in Kansas, USA is worth fourteen dollars?! What a ripoff! The muffin mix is good, and I'd give it 4 stars, but NOT at that price."
5,Not Many Salsa Cd's like this out there & It's Live!!!!!,Manny Oquendo Y Libre Live The band is great the singers are incredible and most important the sound is right on!!!! Most Live Cd's have pretty bad sound and regardless of the band the cd suffers. But not here get it Collector's and the ocasional salsa fan will wnjoy this.
1,A DVD TO BE HEARD AND NOT SEEN,"The entire TV production crew should have been fired after the taping of this concert. The evidence is in 80% of the video. I've never seen so many technical people intruding on a concert. Every close-up of the conductor showed TV crew beyond him -- eating snacks, chewing gum, talking and daydreaming. Whenever the camera was trained on Montserrat Marti, you saw more technical people beyond her. When the camera pulled back to show the entire orchestra and chorus, there were giant shadows on the walls of the cathedral from crewmembers walking around in front of the TV lights.It gets one star as a DVD. If it were being judged for just the music, it should have four stars. It's worth the price just for the wonderful mother-daughter duet (Montserrat Caballe and Montserrat Marti) on ""Leise Rieselt Der Schnee."" Luckily, you can listen to the audio without the video."
4,Kit was complete with everything I needed except.,I didn't realize that the Suzuki 600 didn't have a gasket for the valve cover I would've like to have had this for my bike would make a good addition wink wink.
5,WHAT IS BLACKLOCK'S PHONE NUMBER?????????,"I have only gotten to the part where you have to enter Blacklock's phone number as the door code. I have the paper, but I can't read a thing! Can someone tell me the door code? Or at least his phone number? Or is there something I need to find to help me read the paper? No body in the game will help me! PLEASE HELP!!!! PLEASE!!!"
5,Best Game EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game is the absolute best game ever made. I got this game for christmas and I can't stop playing it. At first I thought it was easy but it can be very hard. Anybody who needs help listen up. 1.To find Blacklocks house follow the blue signs with the white trees.2.To herd the sheep STAY IN A TROT!!!
4,This game is fun,"This game is fun! To catch Blacklock, you have to cut him off across the trail and use shortcuts to not let him get away! It's very entertaining. There's even a part where you have to herd sheep and horses!!!!!! Very cool!I was just wondering if this was the same game as ""Stud Farm Inheritance"" with Pippa Funnell. Please let me know!"
3,Fun but confusing,This game is very confusing and I dont get it. I am stuck on the part where you have to heard the sheep. How do you do it. Please post a review.Thanks.
3,alright,"this game is okay. im still halfway through it and was stuck with the collected and extended canter, but i read some other reviews and learned that you need to gallop, thanks for posting that! the horses were really ugly in this game, and the graphics weren't all that great. (champion dreams: first to ride has MUCH better graphics, and prettier horses.) the horse's gaits are also kind of messed up, like the trot is really awkward looking. i don't really like how you end up with all these horses, though, because you need to spend so much time caring for them. (i dont like paying davy credits:-) ). i mean, grooming one horse is fun, but when you have 6, it gets a bit tiring! if you're looking for a good horsie game, i would definitely reccomend champion dreams: first to ride. its got just as good of a plot as this game, but the horses are prettier and its just more fun overall."
3,From a 13yr old that has played many horse games,"This is a fun game that keeps you at the edge of your seat, but the horses were very unrealistic looking and there were lots of downsides to this game. It was more about a mystery rather than about horses, although you did get to do showjumping, crosscountry, and dressage(Which were all unrealistic looking). Grooming the horses was also one of the downsides, it took forever to groom your horses(Expecially when you got up to 10 horses to take care of!). I would absolutly love this game if only they made the movements of the horses look better(walk, trot, canter),the tack look better,and really just focus it more on the horses. If you love mysteries more than horses, than I would deffenently reccomend this game. But on the other hand, if you like horses better than mysteries You would love these horse games:Equestrian Chalenge*Lets Ride-Friends Forever*(Love this game!!)Lets Ride-Riding StarNONE OF THESE GAMES ABOVE HAVE MYSTERIES IN THEM :D"
5,Best Game!,"I love this game. I think you should get it with the other Saddle Up game. There both fun but I like this the best. Also, I have an answer for the person who's looking for Mr Blacklock's house. You know the blue sign? Follow it and you'll find his house! : ) I love this game!!"
1,"sucks, technically, couldn't play it",The kudosoft website is closed. Ubi doesn't support this game. The game can't be completed because the grooming task will not complete. The meter rises to the top but the green light never comes on. This is very saddening for a seven year old and very frustrating for her father. This is not the first time we've had problems with Ubi. I would sooner throw my money away before I would buy another UbiSoft game.
1,Hard For Children,"I thought this game would be fun. Because i LOVE horses. But its not. Its really hard and the horses suck. if anyone knows how to catch mr. blacklock on the motor cycle, PLEASE HELP!!!!! I've tried so many times!!!!!!!!!!"
4,FYI Doesn't fit 2003 Chevy Suburban,"Bosch products are great. However this according to the ""Auto Make sure it Fits!"" app it was supposed to fit my Suburban. The wires i recieved were about 3 inches to long and the boots didn't fit over the the ignition coils."
1,does not fit,"I ordered these wires for a 19999 Chevy silverado v8 5.3. Used the make sure this fits your vehicle and it said it did but what I got was the part number that I ordered but it fits a 6 cylinder jeep as per the label on the box. Now they are asking me to pay shipping back due to there error, I'm not happy."
1,Coffee air pot,"I have purchased only Tiger air pots, 3.0 liters for many years. This one does not hold the heat like my old Tiger stainless steel. When it arrived, I had to place the ""drip"" section (where the coffee comes out). I should have realized the quality was in question because whenever we pressed the top, the coffee would drip a couple times after you were finished pumping. I will just use it in our camper rather than send it back. In the meantime, I will continue looking for another one."
4,Very Good,This book has a variety of designs. The patterns are very easy to follow. Designs range from tiny to large. I'm very happy with this purchase.
2,Not good,"This video which tries to showcase the life of Richard Lionheart is inaccurate and very badly produced. It seems that the director have spend very little time reading about King Richard I, and the books that he read must have been very thin. Avoid this, there must be better sources out there. If you are interested in the life og Richard I, then read any book on the subject written by John Gillingham."
3,Video of the life of Richard the Lion Heart,"This sixty minute video tape history of Richard the Lion Heart was a BBC series about 40 some years ago. It was part of a long series of programs about great personalities. It was clear it was done on a small budget, and they did not have all the 'tricks' of todays computers at imaging, changing scenes smoothly. But for the price, just a few dollars one gets most of the history of that period in the late 1100's in England and Europe. If one is interested in Richard the English king, it is a worthwhile video."
1,May confirm your worst impressions,"In this collection of mostly instrumental-orchestral covers of his own songs, Burt Bacharach elevates Hal David's lyrics by omission, makes Dionne Warwick look like an interpretive genius, and turns himself into a muzak machine. If you're looking to find out why Bacharach has been granted songwriting deification by some of today's top recording artists, try the original hit versions on the Very Best of BB."
3,"Cute, light read",Not an amazing book but one that's enjoyable enough. It's full of short stories about life on the farm. Some really made me smile or laugh but some were obviously filler to make enough for a book. If you're interested in country living or want a book to pick up now and then this would be a good one for you.
1,would not by again,"The foil cutter broke on the 4th use.The mechanism works, but wore out fast and the directions were not specific. I was surprised that I did not find a youtube video to show its use. There are pictures on the back of the box to demonstrate, but there are not easy for someone who is not mechanically inclined to figure out.I cannot open the 8th bottle of wine since I purchased this because it is broken."
2,"That ""Magical Fruit"" Issue....","I felt I had to warn people about this product. It's not that it's a bad company, or bad product per se. Powdered hummus isn't all that great, but I do see the benefit and convenience of it.The problem is the effect one experiences after consuming it. While every other form of hummus I've tried over the years hasn't caused such a problem, for some reason this company's powdered product does. And it's bad, like, painful bad.So, I suggest if you haven't tried it yet, perhaps buy one box locally and try it first, before committing to a full pack."
1,Lemon Oil to the Extreme,"Unless you like a little hummus with your lemon oil...do not buy this product... To my taste, the lemon oil completely overwhelms every other ingredient."
1,Really does taste like furniture polish,"I bought this hoping to save my self a few bucks as I go through hummus pretty fast. For me this has two tastes, the when you first put the food in your mouth, and then about 30 seconds after you swallow. The first part just tasted bland, and I though I could spice it up a bit. The after taste is what got me. The after taste tastes like furniture polish smells like. Some of the reviews blamed this on the lemon flavoring - I bought this for the lemon flavoring, but again it tastes like furniture polish smells like - not like hummus flavored with lemon."
2,Cheap & Bitter Powder Aftertaste,"This has a cheap flavor, and I could definitely taste a powdered chalky taste with a bitter aftertaste. I tried adding more olive oil, some spices, etc to try to use it all, but it just doesn't taste good. I won't be getting this again."
4,Under the Unminding Skies - Great Music!,An amazing collection with some familiar sound! Patrick Park does not let you down!
1,Beware of all books by Silverthorne Publishing,"I have purchased a number of methods from Martin J. Silverthorne. Some he claims to have devised himself. Some he says others helped. I have found them to be innacurate in the profit results that they all display. Recently I attempted to get back an overcharge to my account from them because they charged me 4 times for a system I purchased once. I have been ignored a number of times. I decided to do some investigating on my own. I could not find a listing at all for the address that they use. The fax number they list does not work. In addition to all this, I could not find a listing at all for a Martin J. Silverthorne in the US. I find it a little funny that the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars, and the reviews with 5 stars sound like something written by a marketing department. I would like to warn everyone to stay away from all material from this company."
3,COMMENTS ON POWER SLOTS BOOK,"In all candor, I expected the book to be more than it was.....however, inasmuch as it concerned the slot machines, it was well written and detailed and probably as positive as you could get relative to playing the slots!"
1,Don't get scammed,I have bought several publishings from this company. Each publishing is a endless circle of telling you to buy another one of there publishings. They offer a 100% garuntee and dont honor it. If you email them they might respond once and tell you that your refund was submitted to your credit card and it is your credit card companies fault you have not got your refund. Dont be scammed like me and many others. Never purchase any publishings by Martin J. Silverthorne.
2,This Book Nearly Duplicates His Other Book,"I bought 'Soul Psychology: How to Clear Negative Emotions and Spiritualize Your Life' and found it five stars worth. I was disappointed in this book due to the extremely heavy overlap between the two books. Personally, I found the other book better written and with greater content."
1,not happy,"the book itself was not in bad physical condition but there were notes and underlining all through it, if i had known this i would not have purchased it!"
1,pitfall,"This book is a pitfall, just like many others out there. The only reason I gave it one star is because perhaps it might be a good lesson, especially for people who like to think they are better than others, more spiritual and advanced.If you follow the teachings of this book you are going to be stuck with your 'clearing procedures' forever. You will also provide a good feeding ground for all kinds of non-physical entities feeding on your energy and using your physical body for their own agendas.Your ego is the best guidance and protection you are given in this reality, getting rid of it is opening yourself up to invasion.Think well about the whole ascension concept, what really happens to you when you ascend, where do you go?The best way for people to grow and learn is to trust their inner guidance. Go out in the nature, watch what's around you, use your senses and learn. Don't listen to 'big cats' trying to get your attention and distracting you."
5,excellent,Excellent acting by the whole cast It kept my interst the whole timeMichelle was very appealing and the movie was of good length
1,Horrible,"This is the unholy combination of dried apricots, inner tubes, and fig newtons. Avoid at all costs. Also, there is no satisfaction policy from manufacturer - just instructions explaining how to store their food products. Check out the manufacturer website.I'd recommend the cherry flavored bars as the those do taste somewhat like cherry pie, and the strawberry and blueberry are also good."
5,"""silent whisper""","I've bought directly from the chief instructor the tapes and its hard to train with out slow motion movement so its great!!!!wish they've done it in the slow mode so will be good for the newly students to learn more details,footwerks and he's aikido he got a point in movements etc . I feel like added more or download more on my martial arts (IQ)glim@asia.com 626-2731777."
3,Good sound but not compatable with most tvs,"The sound is.. decent, especially for the price.However there are 3 RCA cables that need to be plugged into a TV, instead of the common one or two. For those of you that don't really understand what that means, theres 6 plugs to put in your TV, 3 red, 3 white. Most TV's simply have one red and one white reserved."
2,They don't fit!,"Groovy Girls are my daughter's new favorite dolls. But, the clothes don't fit. They are too tight and the velcro closure won't stay together. I won't buy anymore clothes until they improve the quality."
3,"OK, but one can do better than this.","It's difficult to find a recording of Mahler's 4th where there isn't SOMETHING to like; it's the most accessible of his symphonies.If we start with the assumption of good sound quality and orchestral playing, there isn't much here beyond that. Try the Bernstein (SONY, not the DG)or Abbado (Berlin)for a totally different experience. If you want 'cooler' but beautiful sounding, Chailly or Maazel (VPO, Sony)are superior to this one IMHO."
5,"Excellent, Honest, Quick Reference",My husband and I use this book all the time to get some perspective on issues we are dealing with. It is gently written and simple to understand with some great ideas on what to try in different situations. I've actually had my husband call me up on the phone and ask me to look something up in this book for him. Highly reccommended!!!!!
4,You can never go wrong with Fred Rogers,"This book is written in simple terms. Fred Rogers encourages as much forgiveness and understanding of ourselves as parents as he does of our children. He recognized that it isn't much easier being the parent than it is being the child, and that we can give ourselves credit for loving and caring about our children, even when we later decide to change some aspect of our parenting."
3,A humorous look at cultural conflict,"""Defensive Japanese: How to respond to the rude, impolite and insensitive"" is a book of cartoon illustrations of typical encounters that a foreigner might encounter while traveling/living in Japan, accompanied by some Japanese phrases of varying politeness to help or hinder the situation. Things like being stared at on public transportation, language leeches hitting you for some free English lessons, being laughed at for speaking Japanese, etc...I have personally encountered almost every situation in the book, with the exception of the ones about being overcharged, and I have to say I did get a few chuckles from reading this. I don't know how well it works for learning new Japanese phrases, as the book is all in romaji and gives no grammar tips or direct translation of what is being said. You are more likely to make a greater fool of yourself trying to use these phrases.It is good for a laugh, and would make a nice gift to anyone in Japan for an extended stay."
4,Fantastic,"This is a great book for beginers to experts in the saltwater fish/marine department. Its very simple, yet detailed. An overall great book that I highly recommend."
5,Outstanding Book!,"This book is so funny and makes the study of Italian enjoyable. It is challenging and yet not too difficult to comprehend. WIth review of the stories, you can really get a glimpse of Italian humor. Highly recommended, even for beginners."
5,Great Product,"Starting at 15 months, my child refused to ride in the stroller. He is very curious and the stroller limited what he was able to see. We did a lot of research and decided to order this product (the best price at the time was on amazon) and he absolutely loves it. We still have the stroller but never use it. The pack itself is very light weight and does not take up too much room in the car. It is great for walks and running errands. It does take a little time to adjust the weight on your back, but the pack distributes the weight across your back."
4,Suprisingly good...Another great artist ignored,"In the editorial review, it notes that this material was initially released in the UK. Frequently it seems, I turn to Europe to find out what's really going on in Americana/alt-country. Ironic... I purchased it this year due to word of mouth, four years after it's initial release. This is deserving of a much wider audience. Northeast Kingdom, the ""newer"" CD was released in 1998. It is also excellent and largely ignored.The audio clips of The Knitter, although excellent, are not necessarily representative. The first four songs have much more electric guitar and rock sound than the remaining seven (which are more acoustic based). Enjoy and tell your friends what they're missing."
1,What a disappointment!,"I have an earlier edition of this book, and thought that this one would bring things up to date. However, the author is stuck somewhere during the 1970's through the early 1990's. He apparantly hasn't heard of games like TOAW from TalonSoft, or the Close Combat series from Atomic. He even mentions GEnie (wastes several pages instructing his readers how to play online games there) and refers to PC's as ""IBM compatible"". The maps he uses in his example game have been reduced in size, and to top it all off, there's no index (no real need for it--there's not much useful information here). This book is just hopelessly out-of-date. I wish that I wouldn't have to give it any stars. I wonder if Dunnigan actually revised this book himself, or that the publisher hired some hack to do the job. TWO THUMBS DOWN!"
2,Nice chair with major problems,"The chair is very nice looking, comfortable and roomy. It will easily accommodate a very large person. As noted in reviews of other colours, it's a little hard to recline for an average sized person, but quite easy for a tall person. The problem with mine was that the locking mechanism didn't hold the chair in position. No matter what I did, whatever position it was locked in, the chair slid from reclining to upright every time. As I was planning to mostly use it in the reclining position, it is being returned. I didn't see this problem mentioned in the reviews I read, so it may not be a common occurrence, but be aware that this could be a problem."
2,No one to contact,Within 30 days of receiving the chairs the elastic on the headrests was totally stretched to the point it will not hold up the headrests. The plastic guards on the bottom of the legs broke off on both chairs with little exposure to the sun. Even worse their e-mail address is non-responsive and no one answers the phone or messages left. Not a good product for the price and terrible customer service.
4,Insightful,"Makes us ""church members"" think twice about non traditional ways of leading people to Christ. I like her books she has a christian message for all."
5,Must-Read For Anyone,"Wow, all I can say is that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Mr. Elder's book is such an eye-opener. What makes this book so great is that it isn't ""opinion-disguised-as-fact,"" it's just plain ol' numbers laid out there! Mr. Elder gives a perfectly logical explanation of just what those statistics mean for America, and for a lot of people they mean just what they have been thinking for such a long time about what America is really all about."
5,Plain-Sense Talk,"If Larry Elder can make so much sense in less than 400 pages, why can't our political leaders in 2-6 years?Elder's arguments are a mix of traditional liberal and conservative views, and are right on the money. You're against abortion? Don't have one. You think outlawing guns will stop outlaws from getting them? Look at the unsuccessful war on drugs. Democrat or Republican? Same old same old. As Sean Hannity has said, no one argues the Libertarian point of view better than Elder.And no one book covers as many controversial issues in plain-sense language like this one."
2,What Larry Elder Really Cares About,"The only thing Mr. Elder really cares about is himself.While he is a very articulate voice for many good and important ideas, his self-righteous, pompous, ego-driven attitude interferes with any sense of balance and human compassion and make him and his intellect, sadly, less valuable than they otherwise could be. In time, with a little mellowing and some self-reflection, his books and his voice will add great value to our society."
4,The Undercurrent of America,"Although libertarianism is fatally flawed in the America, Larry Elder brings power to this point of view. Technically, I thought the book was poorly edited and repetitive at times, but that doesn't weaken his arguments for increasing personal liberty and reducing government intrusion. I think most Americans would strongly agree with the basic principles.I think Mr. Elder's weakest arguments were for the legalization of all drugs. Many Americans would consider marijuana, but drugs like heroine demand hard evidence and not just fuzzy principles.As a conservative libertarian, I hope everyone in the U.S. will read this book and open their mind to these issues. This book could be a gateway to more pedantic, but scholarly books like John Lott's, ""More Guns, Less Crime""."
3,Elder's right on the war on drugs.,"Larry Elder in this book from 10 years ago lays bare the case that the drug war is destroying America. He is right and it is most unfortunate that 10 years after the publication of this book we still have only made glacial like progress to ending this dumb war. Heck, most states dont even have medical marijuana yet. Elder states that drugs being illegal drives up the price and because of the increased price of drugs, drug addicts commit crimes to fuel their addictions. He brings up that the drug war gives many in the inner cities (in particular young African American males) crimainl records that haunt them for life. He brings up the fact that the drug laws make a mockery of our constitutional rights. DRCnet and NORML are two organizations that in the past 10 years since Elder's book was published have fought to lessen the war on drugs. But alas, few politicans (as 10 years ago) are willing to end it. How much longer can this go on?"
3,"Entertaining, makes good points, but...","Having been somewhat familiar with Mr. Elder, I decided to give this book a read. I must say that Mr. Elder is a very entertaining character. The titles of each chapter invoke laughter alone. He makes some very good points about race relations, how whites bend over backward for fear of being labeled ""racist"". Despite this, I don't think this is the best defense of the libertarian position. Mr. Elder does seem to retreat towards a more ""conservative"" position as a previous reviewer eluded to. I happen to believe in individual autonomy, with responsibility of course, so I don't agree with religious conservatives.Overall, this is a pretty good read. If you are looking for a good scholarly case for libertarianism, there are better books out there, specifically Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith. I cannot recommend that book enough. I suggest checking Mr. Elder's book out from the library, rather than buying it."
5,A Must Read for every American,"I loved this book, and I have recommended it to many friends. He is a tell-it-how-it-is type of guy, and he says the truths about American society and politics where nobody else will. Not only will it make you think about the current position America is in, but he will also give you tips that are applicable to real life. He talks about a ""victicrat,"" a person who always falls into the victim perspective. In other words, these people think everything is somebody else's fault. By realizing this pitfall, the victicrat can move on to being a more successful person by refusing to take the victicrat stance. I also recommend Dr. Phil McGraw - similar philosophies. LARRY ELDER is a great writer. If we all listened to what he has to say, we would be MUCH BETTER OFF!"
2,The Ten Things He Says To Sellout Black America.,"I read this book and it was terrible, it definately is meant to be for White folks who feel guilty about Slavery and 400 years of oppression of Black people.Larry Elder is a Sellout (and an Idiot).He wants to cite examples of two or three Black people-out of 100 million Black folks throughout history-who have become White, and he holds those two or three people up as a shining example of how striving to be White works.It's simply stupid. If only two Blacks have made it to Five Star General in 100 years then somethin' ain't workin'Order The Sellout Diaries Volume 1 ""Everything You Wanted To Know About Sellouts But Were Afraid To Ask"".No Sellout.Theron K. Cal"
1,"""Toe-Tag"" Liberals Have Nothing to Fear from Elder.","Larry Elder's arguments would have been more persuasive if he had tempered them with a little compassion. While he makes good sense on such issues like legalization of drugs, his take on health care and the minimum wage leave me wondering if all libertarians are so cold-hearted. No insurance? Go to an ER--who cares if you have to wait hours for treatment. The insured rich get better health care because they deserve it. Health care is not a right guaranteed under the Constitution, in Elder's view, so the government is not obligated to make sure that all Americans have access to good health care.The book reads like a series of soundbites from his radio program. Poor writing, poor editing, no apparent fact-checking--beware if you want to use his arguments to slap down us ""toe-tag liberals."""
5,Let the truth be told!,"Larry Elder's book is more than just a statement on the problems that have been raising controversy in America today. It is a call to arms for all believers in individual liberty and personal responsibility. Mr. Elder shows true bravado by proving he is not afraid to dispence a little truth in a world that is so quick to look to the mainstream liberal media for answers. This is a very important book because it puts ideas of great thinkers like Sowell, Friedman, Hayek, and the author himself (Yes Larry is truely a ""Sage"") into an understandable and readable text. Years from now, Larry's book will be (or at least should be!) looked upon as one of the first great pieces of political thought of the 21st century."
4,"Great Book, readable, informative, but imperfect","This is a great book, but to save time let me concentrate on a key point of disagreement. I think Elder underplays the continuation of white on black racism in this society, perhaps in part because he does business on ""the Coast"" rather than Middle America. But times have changed dramatically and it is not the obstacle it once was. So it is a matter of responsibilty for African-Americans to look past victimization and the victimization-whining industry in order to move forward. But Elder's too glib dismissal of the ongoing existence of racial prejudice will lose credibility, especially among African-Americans who otherwise desperately need his message."
4,Surprisingly Insightful,"Whether you consider yourself a liberal or a conservative, this book by Mr. Elder is sure to have you re-examine your views on issues that face us each day. From our educational system to Social Security; Foreign Aid to Corporate Welfare/Social Welfare; Gun control to Campaign Finance Reform, Mr. Elder gives an insightful perspective as to the LIBERTARIAN take on these issues. Whether you agree or not, you must give due credit to his research and opinion."
4,The Government is the one on Welfare,"I agree with mostly everything on this book except for his views on Maternity Leave. We're way on our way to becoming socialist and our government thinks they have the recipe figured out; (uhm! lets see, 40% take away from the people and regulate, 60% free market, that sounds just about the right combination) <:-0.Some facts were not backed up as they could have been, but overall, he makes almost all of his points convincingly. Responsibility and accountablility are the root of progress, not paternalism."
5,Never before has a writer so paralleled my own thoughts,Mr. Elder cuts through the obscurity of inter-racial politics and relations and exposes the confounding factors that so substantially inhibit our society. He also provides a vivid blue print for any one to be successful in our country. With out a doubt this work will be remember as voice of truth in a time when the majority of our society is greatly miss lead.Thank you Mr. Elder
4,A great read,"I have often considered myself to be pretty liberal, but thisbook really has made be look at atleast somethings differently, likewhy there is not as much differnce between republicans and democratsas people like to think. Larry Elder also does bring up some goodpoints on the drug war, gun control and the economy, about howgovernment intervention in these areas may be hurting people often thepoor and racial minorities. Elder has a persepective on race that isnot often heard, mabye race relations are really getting better andthat existing programs like affirmative action may not work that well."
5,Courageous!,Everyone that can read needs to read this book.Larry Elder has taken a courageous stand against the politicians and leaders of this country. Why are there not more of us standing up for what is right? He makes me ashamed that I do nothing but complain and never speak out about what I believe in.If he ever wants to run for president I would back him all the way.
4,MORE INSIGHTFUL CONSERVATIVE TALK,"For conservatives it's more of what you already know & have predilections about: gun control, schools, economics race & as always Larry provides plenty of research evidence. There is a latent cockiness to this read in some parts, as some would bemoan but it's insignificant. This book scores high in my opinion - relegating the $60.00 I spent on books & time I spent in my college Sociology class even more worthless. I would recommend it to anyone trying to find their own opinion on these social topics, certainly to teenagers, college students & perhaps government employees simply because it is a collection of facts which are hard to get. My only exception is if you are a minority I'd recommend skipping this book & reading ""Stupid Black Men"" - (overlook the name & just read it) as it speaks to us directly whereas this book ""10 Things You Can't Say..."" I found to be more race neutral."
5,Read this book with your eyes open,All I can say is everyone must read this book. Do not be fooled any more. Larry Elder really hits the nail on the head. READ THIS BOOK!!
1,Facts?,"I'll admit right off the bat that I haven't read this book. But someone just quoted some ""facts"" from this book to me, that I happen to know are inaccurate. I can't swear that she quoted Elder correctly, but if she did, then I would suggest that all of you who enjoyed this book so much go back and do your own research. If the man is drawing his conclusions from false premises, then his arguments aren't worth a thing. I'll admit that I'm a liberal, but I have no problem with open dialogue with conservatives who get their facts and figures correct. But how can you even begin to disagree with someone who isn't dealing with reality? (And before you call me a hypocrite, yes, I'm going to go and read this book for myself now...)"
5,A surprised conservative,"Although I have read articles by Larry Elder for the past year I did not realize he was a libertarian. In this book, Mr. Elder describes several divisive areas in an easy to read and understand approach. His perspective as a hard working, intelligent, no nonsense guy is balanced nicely with antidotes from situations in his life.The chapters on racism expose problems and issues from both sides of the equation. Yet this does not slide into a negative finger-pointing situation, instead Mr. Elder uses hard numbers and examples to get the reader past the emotional reaction.I do not agree with the libertarian position on several issues; however, this book has made me realize that I have more areas that I agree with then disagree with."
5,Awesome!,This is an excellent movie and reminds me of childhood. I'm so happy I finally found a copy of it.
4,Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland,Excellent! For any of those that remember this movie from the 80's. Classic Care Bears. Video was in great condition. Came quickly. Was packaged in a plastic case in a cardboard box. Greatly protected.
4,Not your usual rhetoric,"Mr. Chenoweth manages to avoid the typical anti party hate rhetoric that is common in most stories of this type. For those who have not read many of them, most contemporary American Revolution novels are full of anti Democrat or Anti Republican propaganda. Instead Mr. Chenoweth has focused on the corruptness of the system and those who perpetuate it, with no mention of party affiliation; making this a book with much broader appeal.In structure, elegance/use of grammar and plot development the story reads like many others available as internet fiction (without the 19$ price). Still, the book is VERY entertaining, offers a different angel in this sub genre and shows that this author did his research and put a lot of heart into the story.I would recommend it as an entertaining story, not a literary masterpiece.And as always:Would I look at any other books by this author in the future? YesWould I spend list price on it again? Yes"
3,incandescent lamps,"The incandescent light bulb is over 100 years old. It's not the most efficient thing for turning electricity into light. Well meaning governments are legislating the use of compact flourescent lamps, and the banning of Incancesents. What's wrong with this? I have several friends with Lyme disease, who are bothered by the flicker of flourescent lamps. Possibly people with epilepsy are similarly bothered. They must use incancescent light bulbs. What about them? Brian Sinclair"
5,Great for video capture! Even better now that Vista is supported!!,"I absolutely loved this unit when i had it on my XP machine, so I figured it would be the same when I upgraded to a Vista computer. Apparently the drivers were not compatible for it. I scoured the internet looking for them and could not find them wherever. I felt dis-heartened to think I spent so much money only for it to go to waste. On a last option, I contacted Kworld tech support. Within a few hours, they replied with links to Vista drivers. I was up and running within 30 minutes. Thank goodness for small wonders. For those of you that needs drivers for VISTA:Please click below link and download the latest driver& application.PVR-TV 883/ PVR-TV 883 pro-IIDownload driver:[...]Download application:[...]"
1,Should have done more research,Bought this thinking it will be better to have hardware encoding. But the driver doesn't work with window 7 64bit. The interal firewire connector is in an angle and the firewire cable supplied is too large for the available space. Maybe it will work with xp. Buy at your own risk.
3,"""Flustration""",I liked the plot and story line. But This i love you before sex and hate you right after sex time and again through out the whole book turned me off. The hero was an arrogant B and the girl was a sucker for him. The ending left you wondering what happened to the Aunt and if (SPOILER) William was ever told he was not the father. I like most of C.F's books but this is not one of them in my opinion. SorryDream Catcher
1,Worked great! Until... It Broke!,"Band worked well for about 3 weeks, 12 workouts, until it the band broke off at the handle causing it to fling up and hit me in the face. Not cool. I also bought the Super Heavy (black) Band for more resistance and now am afraid that the same thing might happen. Nice to travel with, however I would have liked to get my moneys worth before it snapped."
2,Ok cables but there are better ones out there,"I bought this cable and another one to replace cables that broke, but then this cable broke within about 1 month of using it it snapped. I went on the website and filled out the forms, called, and emailed about 2 times. I didn't get any responses but after my next email they called me to tell me they were sending me new ones, I just had to send them pictures of the broken cables. The new ones got to my house within a week and have been good so far.The cables are ok, not sure if I would buy them again."
1,Resistance Cable Unacceptable Quality,I used the resitstance band maybe a total of 10 times and the cable broke away from the handle. Luckily it didn't snap back in my face. Total waste of money. I can't recommend this brand to anyone. My health club uses Power Systems bands and we've never had any problems with them. They eventually wear out but they take a beating from the members.
2,poor quality,This band is a very poor quality...I've used it 4 times .and on the 4th time the support handle popped off nearly hitting my face from doing a par put-downs ..so wasn't happy.about that ..invest in a better quality band ..like the one in beach body ..
2,Could be hazardous to your health,"I used these items as part of my physical therapy regime, meaning I have not/did not put them through rigorous workouts. They snapped while in use leaving a warm comfortably delightful feeling in the area of my injury. Good thing it wasn't a groin injury..."
5,One of the best,"This is probably the best book I own on Mac programming. It goes into the lower level, hard-core topics that other books are afraid to touch. As I read it straight through, cover to cover, I see how I've been doing things wrong, and I constantly refer back to concepts I just read when I write new code. It makes me the envy of all my peers."
1,PRODUCT NOT RECEIVED,"I generally do not leave negative feed back, but we have yet to receive our score boards, even though last e-mail confirmation changed from shipped to received - the money has been deducted from our club account - Buckaball has been corresponding with me, but nothing has been resolved as of yet - I would be very hesitant to purchase anything else from this company. S. Redding"
4,Impressive Jazz,"I found a copy of this CD in the bargain bin of a shop about 10 years ago, curious about Gil-Scott Heron singing two tracks on here: ""Is That Jazz"" and ""Blue Collar."" Plus, Joey Defrancesco plays some organ. To cut a long story --- and a long CD --- short, there is some fine funky jazz music on here. Holloway is an impressive sax player and also does justice to compositions by Freddie Hubbard and Lee Morgan."
3,refurbished iPod nano deal,I'm not sure what I think of my iPod nano yet. The promised delivery from Amazon was dead on. Amazon delivers when they say they will deliver. The nano did suffer a completely dead battery two days after it was delivered but I was able to get it traded out for another refurbished nano within an hour of walking into the Apple store. The replacement usually worns but hangs up and requires a reboot now and then. I'll take it back to the Apple story again and see what happens.
3,"Pretty, handy, but does rust","I had this outside for the last 12 weeks of the growing season last year. When I folded it up to store it for the Winter, I found several patches of rust. It was especially bad along the seams. I had specifically searched for a folding rack that was weather resistant. This is not weather resistant. If you buy it, put some rust protection on it before setting it outside."
5,Fantastic-essential reading for anyone interested in 1798,"In this the 200th anniversary year of the rebellion, this is essential reading. the book destroys the myths of republicanism and patriotism, and shows what the human spirit can endure despite overwhelming odds."
5,Best Irish Historical Novels,One of my primary interests is Irish history. It is my opinion that Thomas Flanagan is the best writer of Irish historical novels. I read his three books when they were originally published but I recently had the pleasure to reread them. The Year of the French starts his tale and it is a memorable story. I got caught up in the characters and could place myself in the time the events occurred. Flanagan is a masterful story teller. It is too bad that he did not write more books. I strongly recommend his other two books:The Tenants of TimeThe End of the Hunt
3,Heady Stuff,"I kept with the reading even when it was difficult. The writing is elevated prose, almost poetry, but the characters and events, I had difficulty tracking. For those deeply interested in Irish history, it's worth the effort."
5,Miracles really do happen!,"This little book is an anthology, a record of miracles that have happened to people from Paul Crouch, founder of Trinity Broadcasting Network, to every day, ordinary folks like you and me. The stories inside the book are testimonies of amazing acts of God in the daily lives of God's people. The writing is fast paced and easy to read. This book invites you to believe in the miraculous. It's a good read - you won't want to put it down!!"
5,pure fun,"Let me start by telling you that the setting is in a Bally's gym and she is leading a Bellydance workout class.With that being said, I love this video. Amira is such a joy to watch for the workout and her perfomance. She actually looks like she is enjoying herself.It is such an encouragement to see that there are different ages (yes, there are kids here too) and body types here. So you don't have to have a 24-inch waist to do this. Amira even goes to some people in the class to show them the proper way to do the various exercises. If you want to see the workout done right,you'd have to watch Amira herself. If you look at the rest of the class you won't feel so bad because even with the little imperfections during the workout, you can tell that they are still having fun.There is a section in the video where it says free style for a beautiful body, and in here you just dance for the sake of dancing and of course have fun while you're at it."
4,So Good So Far,"This tent was easy to put up in the dark, (I did pre assemble before I left, and did get a rip though). Had a downpour and no water entered. Seems like a great product, especially for the price.. this is my third brand of tent, and so far the driest. Its pretty spacious, with lots of pockets. I think the lightweight feature and easy assembly is the best feature of the product."
4,Great music,"If you like the Byrds,The Beatles or any number of early 60's artists this CD will appeal to you. Great songs,well done, Lloyd pays homage to his roots. I highly recommend it."
2,The poor man's Marshall Crenshaw,"This disc contains unremarkable performances of average material, except for the absence of a good melody, and excepting ""In a Perfect World,"" which is a pretty decent song."
2,It's like one big ad,"Ping is just a big ad for Yahoo! It has information (emoticons) that's available on the internet for free. Also the little stories by users are cute, but still lame."
3,it was okay,"i liked it, it was sweet with drama with the characters. it had me on the edge of my seat...really wasn't a romance novel that i would read again, but still was nice"
2,"A pamphlet, not a book","At all of 43 pages this book is certainly not worth the price. Most of the information is useful only if you've never heard of detectors or coin hunting. That said, the author is enthusiastic and does give some ideas for beginners."
4,Helpful Information,I was given this book as a gift. It gave helpful information to go along with my medal detector Christmas present. As a beginner the information was useful. I recommend this book for anyone who is new to detecting and just wants basic information. Kathy W.
2,Don't bother,Book was very short with some interesting points. Some were useful and others were very obvious. Seems more like the author put this book out to make a quick buck.
5,Kids love it,My twin 4 year olds love Fireman Sam. They sing the opening song even when their not watching it. Show teaches kids about safety. Adults will enjoy it also.
1,Hecky Naw!!,"The movie was terrible even for me, I mean I am a fan of cornball movies but this is the worst I had seen in a long time. Costas Mandylor and the man who performed as Dr. Chopper held up the movie. Towards the end the actress told Dr. Chopper, ""I want you to meet someone, ""My inner b***h"" then she throws a garbage can, I thought she was going to pull out a razor or something. Horrible!!!"
4,Unreal Tournament is unreal,I bought this for my 47 year old kid of a fiance and he just loves it. He plays at least once a day sometimes more and not for only a few minutes either.
2,Low GP dont get this game,"I have a gfocer 8600 gt and when i tried to play this games, i felt like i came back to the atari days, the resolution suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! big time but i guess isn't the game fault is my computer's"
2,They borked this one up..,There's plenty to complain about so I won't. Go read around on some UT forums and you'll see what I'm talking about. The game was released unfinished. The amount of people playing online is very low. I have a feeling some of the good reviews here have a vested interest in seeing this game do well.Don't waste your money until you've done some research.
5,GAME IS A MUST HAVE!,"The game is awesome. Truly great. Why anyone would give it a bad review beats me. This is a great replacement for ut2004 and i can't too see what the mod community puts out.Pros: Beautiful game if you have the correct hardware. Awesome weapons and new vehicles. Gameplay is fast and fun.Cons: Not enough default maps, More player skin choices."
2,Extremely disappointed,I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this game. I have come to expect much more from the Unreal franchise.
5,Simply FUN!,"This game is fun for anyone who likes the Halo type games.UT3 had better graphics than Halo, but overall, the game play and user allowable mods are what I love... multiplayer gaming is awesome now that you can play against PC and PS3 games, cant waith for xBox too.This game exceeds my expectations, I played Halo 3 and would give that a 9, while UT3 gets 10!"
3,Frantic Pace...,"The game is nice enough, but the pace of it is frantic. It seems like it is moving way to fast to be able to actually navigate and aim. I've played my share of FPS, and I felt like a button pusher on this one. Not bad if you are into that I guess!"
3,Game or Tool?,"For starters let me just say i bought this game to use the Unreal Editor, I've never really enjoyed an Unreal Tournament game. I've always been more of a Counterstrike kind of guy. That being said Unreal Tournament III hasn't changed my position on the matter.The graphics are pretty phenomenal but be warned if your PC barely meets the system requirements expect to set your settings low in order to play the game fluidly.Gameplay though hasn't changed much and don't expect a single player experience. The campaign is just a bunch of random skirmishes like an online match but with cpu opponents. However there is an option to play through the campaign mode online which sadly doesn't do much.I'm just gonna end by saying Unreal Tournament III should only be purchased by diehard fans of the series or people that want to mess with the Unreal Editor."
2,3+ years for a half finished game!!!,"I run a UT2k4 gameserver and couldn't wait for UT3, had a 32 player server all ready to go, then we find out that there is no Linux based server yet, so on to a windows server we go. Where to begin, dark boring maps, same weapons, cheesy new items (white arrows, Hoverboard.)On the admin side there is no webadmin, which makes managing the server a PITA, no working redirect using compression!!Overall they released a 1/2 finished game it's a shame, UT99 and UT2k4 were such great games, seems like they are more interested in getting this ready for console play. :("
2,boring - no single player,the story mode campaign is the exact same thing as the multiplayer arena except with dialogue. Does have nice graphics though. So if you're looking for a JUST multiplayer deathmatch kind of game then give this a look.
1,No install disc was included,"I gave this as a gift to my husband Christmas morning, imagine my surprise when the case only had the patch disc and no install disc...very unhappy!"
1,Disappointment.,"Nobody was playing this game, so I sold it. The graphics were so ""good"" that they are too tasking on all but the most extreme gaming PC. Your FPS will be low, or you'll turn the graphics down till they look worse than UT2K4.If this is the future of PC gaming, I'll just buy a console. Maybe then when I get online, there will be people playing it. My final connect showed less than 100 people playing on any one game type."
1,Warning do not buy this game!!,"If you have a router and plan on running your own server so you and your friends can go head to head like the old 99 Ut , think agian. Even if you know how to port forward, epic programed the game to throw its hands up in the air and say, oh no Nat on a router who would ever do such a thing. Disabling it doesnt work, countless hours google-ing. Nothing , absolute trash. I am thinking of demanding my money back from best buy... Thanks epic, you really let the Ut fans down.$50.00 bucks less for me, and a $50 dollar rip off in your wallet."
5,another SWEEEET UT game!,"Easily the best of the UT franchise, UTIII brings you top-notch graphics and even more intense, accelerated gameplay. In terms of gameplay, it includes all of the same game modes (CTF, death match, team DM, warfare, etc) from UT4, but with better vehicles, amazing graphics, and a pretty cool story. Of course, if you like the UT games youre probably not in them for the story : ) BUY this game! UT3 doesnt disappoint!!!!"
4,Nothing New,"I bought this game for my husband for Christmas. I am not a gamer, so I collected information from him for this review. He reports that the game is fun to play, but hasn't really changed much from earlier versions."
3,Dictionary Format,"Very much inclusive of even slight variations on a theme, with materials drawn from any recordable usage. Hard to read just for the enjoyment of reading, certainly suited to looking up a proverb you are already familiar with in order to discover it's origins. This book will soon be rendered mute simply by people looking the information up on the internet."
1,cracked,"I'm one of the lucky unlucky ones. I got one of these as a gift then waited a year to use it (I was very new to homemaking). When I did use it for the very first time the stoneware cracked all the way from the bottom up one side. I have successfully used it for several years now with only a few minor leaks, but I know that dinner might be a disaster every time I turn it on. It finally split while I was washing it today. To replace just the pot costs as much as a new one in stores. Buyer beware."
3,cracked crock,"I've used this pot about a dozen times over the past year. Great for cooking a large batch of chili or stew. Cleaning up today, I noticed a crack that ran all the way around the bottom inside. It doesn't appear to go through the stoneware, but its probably not save to continue use. I noticed that another reviewer had a similar experience.I'll probably just buy another one, but somebody ought to keep count."
2,Doesn't compare...,"I have had this crockpot for about three years now. I got a Hamilton Beach about six months later. My Rival one has cracks all the way around the walls and bottom of the pot, and there is one that goes all the way through the bottom, just waiting to split. My HB, on the other hand, has ZERO cracks! I use these just about every day for dinner or homemade broth. I am about to buy a replacement for this one, and it'll be a Hamilton Beach crock pot. I gave it two stars, as it worked well throughout those three years."
3,Alright for price,"the crockpot seems alright for the price but not as good as I expected. It is rather large and definitely can feed more than 4-6 people. i made beef stew first in it and it didn't come out as well as I expected, even tho I followed a recipe for time, ingredients, etc. this crockpot is also available at stores like walmart for less so I'd recommend just getting one from there and saving on shipping & time."
1,failed after one use,"The slow cooker worked well the first time I used it. The second time, the light turned on, but it never heated up. I was disappointed, because the size was perfect for me. I'll try another brand."
2,Disappointed that there was no timer,"I guess I didn't realize it didn't come with, or didn't realize how much I would need, an automatic timer (that shuts the whole thing off when the pre-set cooking time has been reached). What's the point of having something cook while you're away if you have to plan to be home at a certain time to shut it off? My next crock pot will *definitely* have an automatic timer!"
1,Piece of crap,"Well Amazon sent me a crock pot made by a different manufacturer. I ordered one made by Rival. They sent one made by Crock-Pot. The one they sent is one readily available in stores nearby. I could have bought one there, cheaper. The reason I ordered it through Amazon was because I wanted the Rival. Thus, Amazon cheated me. It's too much hassle sending it back so I'll just put it in the trash. The one they sent doesn't even have a real lid. It's got this fake thing with a knob on top you have to remove with a screwdriver every time you use the pot to clean the fake lid, and the metal surrounding the glass portion of the fake lid is impossible to clean, so the pot is unsanitary and useless. The cheap pot they sent, the Crock-Pot is also made in China so I'll look for an American made product with a real lid."
4,Nice CrockPot,I got this to replace a very small crock I had. This is a nice size...plenty of space without being too big. Crock looks nice on the table to serve out of and fits in the refrigerator well if I do not want to divide up leftovers into smaller containers right away.Outer heating element part is lightweight and wipes clean well. The high setting seems to be a bit hot. I use it only for an hour tops before turning on low. --definitely would use on warm if leaving on for more than 4 hrs.Crock lifts out nicely because it isn't too heavy. --don't like lifting weights in the kitchen :) The crock cleans nicely even if there is a baked on mess. --simply rinse out excess debri and add hot soapy water to soak awhile....cleans easy.Food tastes great and the heavy lid helps greatly to hold in heat and moisture while food is cooking.
4,Solid Crock-pot,"I needed this for my dorm. Now I can make cheap soup with ease. I've already made two big batches of soup and real turkey stock from simmering a turkey carcass and bones. It works really. This is not a RIVAL brand crockpot, however, so the product image description that shows it as a RIVAL brand appliance is misleading."
1,Dangerous Crock Pot,"I got this Crock Pot as a wedding gift and used it for about a year. As far as crock pots go, I think it worked great. However, last week I plugged it in, and there was a huge spark and smoke coming from the crock pot. There was also a burn mark on my counter. When I flipped the crock pot over, I saw that the plastic casing around the very base of the electrical cord ( where the cord meets the crock pot) had worn and the internal metal wires of the power cord were exposed. My husband ( who is an electrical engineer) told me that if I had been touching something metal ( like the stove)when I plugged it in, I could have been seriously injured or killed.If you own or buy this crock pot, please check the base from time to time for ware on the electrical cord. Mine wore out after normal use for 1 year. I often leave my crock pot on when I go out and I shudder to think what may have happened if it had started fire."
4,Great!!!,"I need a decent size pot to feed a family. This one is great. Cooks well, easy to clean. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I wish it had a timer. Super product, i reccomend this product highly."
4,Nice crock,"Basic slow cooker without bells and whistles handles meals such as pot roast and lamb stew well. Interior ceramic crock pot is constructed well. The aluminum heating shell seems rather flimsy by comparison. For simple preparations of all-day-cooking meals, it's hard to beat at the price."
1,Pot Cracked,"While using the crockpot for just the SECOND time, I noticed a crack that ran around approximately 1/3 of the perimeter of the crock's top edge. I did not put anything into the pot that was too cold/too hot, did not drop the pot or hit it against anything, did not place it in the refrigerator while still hot, did not put it on the stove or in the oven (should I go on?). I have another Crock-Pot that is about 15 years old and still going strong. I am extremely disappointed about this purchase and not optimistic about Rival's response."
4,Cheap and Gooooood,"This is great. Classic cooker... low price...this model does not burn food, the heat settings both work well and it is simply white so it looks somewhat modern and can fit in to a newer kitchen.Soup is a breeze with a crock-pot. Just toss a bunch of stuff insode and its ready a few hours later... and it is flavor filled.This is a simple, basic and fun tool for the kitchen."
4,Great Cooker for the Price,"Nice, basic cooker. Nothing fancy but gets the job done. I have always had good experiences with Rival products."
1,Boils even on the low setting! Rival CS is no help.,"My crockpot causes liquids to go to a rolling boil, even on the low setting (and even when the crockpot is filled to the appropriate level)! The liquid then spills out the top and into the metallic part of the cooker and onto the counter top. What a mess! Rival customer service blamed the problem on me. Right... I must have turned the dial too fast or something!I'm going to dump this for another brand."
2,"Ok crockpot, but...","I bought this crockpot to replace an older one that went out. I have used crockpots successfully for many years, so this is not user error. The low setting is actually high, and the high is even higher. I have to alter all of my recipes, and my supervision of the crockpot as though I were cooking on high. Many times the food around the sides and the bottom scortches. And yes, I am using plenty of liquid.I would not buy this item again. I will be replacing it soon with a higher quality crockpot."
1,Earlier models RECALLED for safety reasons,"The Consumer Product Safety Commission has recalled all Rival Crockpots made before September 04. Anyone who has bought a crockpot can call them and get it replaced. This is the second recall of these crockpots for the same reason, so they obviously didn't improve the product after the first recall. Seewww.rivalrecall.com(...)."
5,The Absolute Best,"When I purchased this unit I was with my mom and sister and we all purchased identical units. My mother and I absolutely loved this crockpot, but my sister constantly complained. One day during a family get together at my sister's house I noticed she was cooking with very little liquid and at an extremely high temperature and started to complain that the food was overcooking and that her unit must be defective. I had to tactfully hint at her to read the instruction manual and after she did so, she never again had a problem. It just goes to show what can be accomplished when you read the instructions. They say 99% of product malfuntions are due to human error and I guess this proves it."
3,Defective lids on some Rival crockpots-cookers,Handle on lid of my Rival Crock Pot came loose. Had not used it very many times. Tried to tighten handle but it came apart. Plastic that held it together just crumbled. Apparently the heat from crock pot damaged it although it was used mostly on low and should have been able to withstand the heat. Thinking twice about buying another Rival with that type of lid.
5,rival 6 quart crock pot,"I am very happy with the crock pot, and highly recommend it. It makes meal preparation very easy"
1,poor design,this particular brace has no tension rod...it merely screws in to studs on left side then right side and merely connects them in the middle to support the box...but there is no obvious tension force being applied horizontally against the studs. The pictures above do not match the product. Look for a different product for this job.
2,Not the MTB I grew up with,"This band might have the name ""The Marshall Tucker Band"", and Doug Gray is certainly the singer, but rest assured, they're NOT the Marshall Tucker Band that most of is long time fans know and love. What do they lack? Toy Caldwell, Tommy Caldwell, Paul Riddle. I'm not 100% sure, but I don't think that Jerry Eubanks is on this disc either. In my opinion, without these guys they just don't have the same fire and jam-a-bility that the Tucker Boys of old had. It's true, this CD is better than some of their other ""recent"" releases. Call me old fashioned, but if I want to hear Tucker do the blues, I'll throw on my well wornWhere We All Belongdisc, or the newer release,Stompin' Room Only (Unreleased Live Recording)."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed it!,Doug`s vocals were as strong as I`ve heard them in years.There`s nothing better than the blues ecept for Tucker doing the blues.
4,Excellent Product,"My skin is quite sensitive, and I have rosacea. Neova's Milk Cleanser is mild, yet leaves skin feeling clean and smooth. I've used this product for over one year. Additionally, with the cleanser, I use twice daily a Clarisonic (delicate brush), which helps to keep my skin tone in good condition."
4,So far so good,"Bought this the other day after returning 1. a Sony DVD recorded that cost $200 and did not read new discs and failed after a few burns, 2. the Samsung 130 recorder $135 that could not read lower end blank DVD-Rs. I knew nothing about Lite-On, but it was on sale at BJs for $100. First impressions is that it CAN read the DVD-Rs that the other two could not, and the pic quality appears much better than the samsung and about the same as the sony. I am a little concerned that the other older lite-on burner failed after a year (according to the other cust reviews), but so far this is great for the price, or even upwards of $200."
4,Keeps the deer damage to a minimum,I actually harvested beans this year because of this product. Usually the deer eat the young plants to the ground.
1,water,"I tried and tried but it did absolutely nothing. So I tasted it and to my surprise, It was water."
3,Interesting stories,"I found Standing Next to History to be filled with some great stories about Joe's relationships. I found it hard to get past the numerous typos however. Every occurance of the word ""I"" which is followed by a year is replaced with a one (1). For example: ...after we first met in 1972,1 thought he was a great guy."
3,Secrecy?,"Aren't agents forbidden by law to write or publicize insider details? or any details regarding protocol, etc. I guess the confidentiality agreements celebrities make mexican illegal immigrants sign are stronger legal documents than what the secret service uses...."
3,A Great Read,"This is the book I wanted to read about the Secret Service. There is a deep credibility to the author`s telling, a sense of his professionalism, commitment and pride in his service. Mr. Petro wasn't ""dishing the dirt"", but was taking this reader into the history he lived. It seemed to me that he took great pains to be equitable, even charitable towards those he worked with, his counterparts from other countries and most especially those he had the privilege of protecting. I am grateful for his service, his sacrifice and the tenor he employed in writing this book."
4,Great Book,I found this to be one of the better books I've read this year. Excellent information with out over playing it. A good guy doing a difficult job.
5,Recommended for those interested in the Reagan Era and the Secret Service,"If you have any interest in the presidency of Ronald Reagan or the Secret Service, I highly recommend this book. The tone is very matter-of-fact, but what comes through is what an honorable person Joseph Petro is. He lost out on a possible N.F.L career when he was drafted for the Viet Nam War, but our country, and especially its elected officials during the time of his service, gained a great deal.A very engaging book."
4,Entertaining Read,This is a pretty interesting read. Petro gives us a glimpse at a side of the president few people get to see. It is also interesting to learn that there is a good deal of politics inside the secret service itself.For me this was very entertaining and enlightening. A good book but not a great book.
4,Very enjoyable!,"I had been wanting this book for several years after seeing it reviewed on one of the talk shows. This book was very interesting especially when the author talks of his experiences with the different presidents especially Reagan, who he covers more than any others. I enjoyed the behind the scene looks at what it takes to actually move a president from place to place and to different countries. I did not care for the discussions of internal politics of the Secret Service, I found those parts pretty boring.I am glad I finally found this book and had a chance to read it."
5,"Excellent book, amazing glimpse into the Presidency","This book is really three books in one: it is an amazing look inside the Secret Service's daily operations, it is a history book, and it is a book offering insight into who Ronald Reagan really was as a man and a President, told by someone who, as the title says, was standing right there watching and experiencing it.In this book you get to read fascinating stories from a man with a unique perspective - not an aide, not a close friend nor family member, not a political rival, but a man who willingly took on the responsibility of physically protecting the President.You will get to read about the time that Air Force One almost crashed, and how often the SS fights with foreign countries about whether or not they can carry guns while protecting the President. (?!??!)In all, a fascinating and easy read that offers a unique insight - truly behind closed doors - into the Secret Service and the Reagan Presidency."
5,STANDING NEXT TO HISTORY,"VERY WELL WRITTEN. ALMOST TOO EXTENSIVE BUT STILL DIDN'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN UNTIL IT WAS FINISHED. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED; EXPECTED A ""DRYER"" HISTORY OF THE SECRET SERVICE. WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN OUR HISTORY AND WHAT IT TAKES TO MAINTAIN OUR DEMOCRACY."
3,Not as interesting as expected .,"This book was ok, I just expected it to be more riveting. A friend read it and enjoyed it, so I bought it."
4,USSS protection of a president,"If you would like an insiders view of the Reagan years, this is a great book, or if you have an interest in how the United States Secret Service works protecting our President and Vice President, there are many interesting examples and stories. ."
2,Standing next to history is really not,"When I purchased this book I thought I was purchasing and would get hardback,instead I got the paperback version. If you're looking for details, culture or how things run in the secret service, the book's got it - otherwise it reads monotone."
4,Standing Next to History : An Agent's Life Inside the Secret,"While this book may be a good read, I do not suggest using it for reference in an essay. Some of the facts seem to be missing. After all, we are not going to learn anything the secret service doesn't want us to know, and the facts may be changed, barely mentioned, or not even mentioned so that the reader doesn't hold any impression the secret service does not want them to have.Furthermore THE PRIOR review sounds too much like a ""I'm selling it on the behalf of the publisher"" kind of review. Not a simpler note, it imparts knowledge of the book, but has no commentary beyond what a typical ""must buy"" review would be like."
4,Standing Next to History,"This book gave some very interesting and revealing insight into the Secret Services' job of providing protection to the highest officers of our government. After some rocky beginnings when holders of high office were either killed or wounded or suffered some close calls from those who want to kill this nation's leaders the Secret Service is doing much better. It would provide a fine career for young, intelligent, dedicated persons."
5,"Solid, Factual and Compelling",Mr. Petro had every opportunity to sensationalize what was obviously a fascinating career in the midst of some of the most important people of the last century. He did not. He wrote an excellent book based on fact and experience and it was compelling without the need to embellish. A solid and quick read for anyone with an itch for American History.
3,could be better,"If you are more interested in the haunting itself rather than whatever happened to make it occur, this book is for you. The stories are shortand and unsatisfying. It is nicely written but the material itself could use a ittle help."
5,"Not just pretty pictures, a compelling story, too","This is a stunning book--amazing photos of amazing trees. But the text is equally good. I enjoyed all the stories about the trees, and how Balog got the photos. Give this book to your favorite tree lover, photography lover, or anyone who wants a unique view of America."
3,"actually 1/2 inch drive, not 3/8","ordered looking for a 3/8 drive torque wrench, when it arrived it was a 1/2 inch. Not worth sending back, so I have an extra 1/2 inch torque wrench"
4,"Sure, it's partisan! That's the idea!","A wonderful hate-fest for Bush haters (and there are a lot of them)! And plenty of facts along with the invective. I didn't agree with absolutely everything in the book, but a lot of it was right on target. Wonderful essays, cartoons and quotes from the Misunderestimated Man. Why should the cons have all the fun being partisan and nasty?I was a bit surprised not to see some negative review by an outraged conservative, but then, would a Bush partisan actually ever buy this book?"
3,What a perfect title!,"The only thing dumber than George W. Bush, are the people who voted for him. After reading this book, I have an even lower opinion of this moron! And I didn't think it could get any lower. You are ruining our country, please resign as our president! And don't touch Social Security! We are in bad enough shape as it is thanks to you. If you despise this president as much as I do, then this is the book to get."
1,The title speaks volumes,Hate-filled people attract or convince very few people. At least this book is up-front about its level of rhetoric.
2,Pass on this,This is primarily a collection of powerpoints-gone-DVD with a lifeless narrator. I am a huge fan of WWII material and this really fell short. Save your money for documentaries made by the big guys.
4,Much better than the rest,4-1/2 Stars.Easy to assemble.Framework Materials of good quality.Seems to be sturdy and easy to use.Wheels a little chincy but seem to workYes I would recommend this over all the others I've looked at.
1,Poor feminist trash...,"One of the worst movies that I've seen lately.Even good actors cannot help a stupid script.In Samuel's place I would throw out such a wife without any regrets,even after 20 years of living together.His crying and begging her to return,outbursts of rage and silly revenge acts don't cause any sympathy.Suzanne's behaviour doesn't make any sense.A spoiled with luxury and bored housewife,looking for love-sex adventures, destroying her family's life and finally commiting a crime.For what? Don't waste your time on this schlock!"
1,Leaving,"I did not like it. She was a mess, I just did not like how desperate she was in the relationship with her lover... I just don't know what he saw in her as she always looked very dirty, messy.Don't recommend it."
3,WTH was THAT?,"ookay, this is a wonderful intense, raw and talented performance by KST. BUT the story itself and the representation of particular characters talks some MIGHTY shizz. These are not nice people - not the wife, not the third party and obviously not the husband. But watch the former two when they take and when they drink the stolen wine. That's telling.I guess this will speak to anyone married for the wrong reasons and the rest of us will be completely appalled. So if you like Lady Chatterly, Madame Bovary and god help us all, The English Patient. This may echo with you. THIS is why divorce law is a profitable profession. holy cats"
2,Can't re-arrange numbers on board leads to a sub-par experience.,"The board is not fully-randomizable (desert is in the middle, numbers are glued on). That lowers the replay-value substantially. Just get the real edition; it's only $10 moreThe Settlers of Catan."
3,Super Tiny & Not Travel Hearty,"A few notes:-Lots of tiny pieces; hard to see some of the symbols. I cannot imagine trying to play this game in actual travel conditions, such as a train or plane (plane especially, since you really have to have 3-4 players).-There are no extra pieces, so if you lose one of those tiny little things (i.e. in some well-placed crack on the train) you are out of luck!-NOT a 2-person game as the Amazon site claims. Sure, you can play it as a 2-person game (search the internet for 2-player Catan) but it is designed for 3-4 players.-Otherwise, game play is good, but given the comments above I question my decision to purchase this over the regular edition."
4,Settlers Rocks,This is a really fun game. I did not understand from the description that I was getting a smaller (travel) version of the game but it's OK for the price. I have not played the travel version because they are gifts so I can't really say much about how the travel version compares to the bigger version.
2,this version of Catan is Not big enough for a gift,"I purchased this version of Catan to offer as Christmas gift because I liked the framed board. But when I received it, i was disappointed. It is very small. I don't even want to play on it. I returned it and ordered the regular version."
5,Great For on the GO!,"I love this game, and when i saw that they had a portable edition i just had to get it! Shortly after it arrived my family and i went on a cruise to Alaska, and we took this with us to play on the plane and during down time."
4,Great little version of the classic Catan.,This is a great version of the classic Settlers of Catan if you want to have the full experience of play without resorting to the dice game. The only complaints with this version are that you can't reassign the values of the tiles and the dessert is always in the middle ... that and the fact that the cards are very tiny are my only complaints. I would suggest that you rubber band the box so that you don't lose components or just be careful not to toss it into your trunk. I keep this game in my trunk at all times as it is quick and easy to play.
4,"Very nice, but ...","... not innovative enough! What could really have been made better is the box itself. What you get is literally the normal size game box just shrinked. It's about 4 1/2 cm think and most of the space inside is just air. They could have easily fit everything into a 2cm thick box. The box is also made out of cardboard - if you really take it with you travelling, that box won't hold long. A plastic box would have been much better.Other than that the numbers can't be swapped and for the size of the box, the streets, etc are really, really small. Having said that, I wouldn't have taken the big game with me travelling. Overall, if I find another thinner box this game is ideal for travelling..."
5,Good family fun,We were introduced to this game by some friends and it is relatively easy to learn and is fun to play. Even my 7 year old can play with us. The only problem is the human factor... some people can take too long to make a decision about their move. So choose who you play with - but you can't blame the game for that. It is is fun and we play it about 3-4 times per month (sometimes that much on a holiday weekend).I would not hesitate to buy again.
5,Great boots,I love em. They fit my enormous feet perfectly and I haven't slipped on the ice yet. Thanks to me for buying them for myself. :)
5,great boot,"I got this boot not expecting much but wow, I was wrong. These things are very light, can take a pounding, and look great too. The insulation (200g) is really not enough to keep you too warm but on the otherside, it does not make your foot sweat either! If you are thinking about buying these or timberlands Pit Boss version, get these. They are leaps and bounds ahead of the pit boss."
3,great shoes,i like the shoes but they were the wrong size. i was wondering if you can send me a new pair out to me
3,Wrong Item,"This boot was very nicely made however, it wasn't the boot that my son wanted so I had to return them to Altec.com. I am still waiting for the refund but I don't know whether it should come from amazon (which is the name on my credit card) or altec (who charged me for the correct boot). Please let me know how long it takes for a refund. thank you."
5,Great boots!,"I've had a few pairs of regular Timberland Premium boots before and the first pair lasted a long time (17 yrs). I don't wear them every day but the first pair was used while riding dirt bikes, hiking, snow, etc. My last pair was sent in after only a couple of years due to a rip in the seams and leather, not from abuse. I bought these thinking they'll be a bit tougher. I've had them for a few weeks now and they're much more comfortable and feel like my first pair. I don't wear them daily but have worn them for 3 days straight just to break them in and they're really comfortable. Highly recommended."
3,"Good Fit, Comfortable, Don't Hold Up","Ive been buying these boots for about two years now, and the only reason I kept going back and purchasing them was for the fit/comfort. No break in period for these boots the fit great right out of the box. I work in road construction, and these boots do not hold up. They are good for about four months of hard work then they just start to fall apart. The steel toe wears through the leather, the stitches on the sides pop, and the soles wear out faster than cheap tires on a dragster. Ive probably spent at least 600 dollars over the past few years on these boots, and now Ive switched to a more expensive better warrantied boot. If you want a temporary boot that looks good and fits great these are for you, but for around fifty more dollars you can get yourself something that will last a lot longer."
4,Still good,Been using this model boot for 10 years and they're still good. Gladd I was able to get them for a good price at Amazon.
4,Great boot,"Great boot very comfy nice to find extended size and width going to add a little more in sole padding for waliking on hard surfaces all day, but that is my prefrence. recommended."
4,Great boots!,"They're a little heavy, but not as heavy as the premium ones by Timberland. They're comfortable and fashionable. The reason I took one star off is because they could be lighter, and they also run a bit small."
5,most comfortable work boots,You can be on your feet all day in these on concrete floors no problem. The sole and boot last and last the only part that will finally give up is the inside insert. Thanks for the wide option.
5,I love these boots,"These boots are perfect! I can wear them all day long. Great for working inside and outside, in all kinds of weather."
5,The Perfect Boot,Perfect for any condition. Warm enough for cold days yet not too insulated for warm days or indoors.I waterproofed them with mink oil and they darkened slightly but not enough to realize a major difference in fact they look better. Can wear them all day with comfort. Very nice.
3,ok,"excelente producto, muy comodas y elegantes, llego en buen tiempo y no hubo retraso alguno pronto he de realizar otra compra de las mismas botas."
5,Timberland Boots,"These work boots are great! They are very comfortable and seem to be very durable as well. I would recommend going to a store to try a pair of these on first, then ordering them from amazon. They seem to run just a tad large."
2,Too expensive for a printed copy,"George Lane is one of the best technical analyst out there, his stochastic indicator did really good for some time in the dow jones market although parameters should be changed from time to time based on the market movements still stochastic is considered one of the best indicators ever made.It is very important to understand the correct equation is not preserved in all analysis software therefore its important to take the original equation and compare it with the one available in these software. In this PRINTED COPY! It's not a book! he discuss how to use it along with RSI I will not say I didn't like it but again it's not the HOLY GRAIL indicator, at the end of the day I end up putting it in the shelf and never used it.It is good to have a copy of George Lane work but not at this price!!! Specially that we are talking about a copy which literally been printed and put together for you!"
2,bar stool review,I was surprised at how light these stools were. I have decided not to use them for sitting on but as plant stands. I would not feel comfortable having any adult use them for sitting on.
2,"Great plant stands, bad stools.",Title says it all.These are not sturdy at all - my youngest weighs 100 lbs and they can't take that weight without wobbling.They also have little plastic buttons on the feet. These will crack and fall off and the feet will then damage any kind of wood or linoleum flooring.They are uncomfortable - but you can tell that from the picture.However - these make fabulous plant stands. I gave the set to my sister who put them near her pool. They look great there!These are also somewhere between a brown and oiled bronze color.
2,"Not barstools, they are counter height.","The stools are cute, FOR THE PRICE, not very sturdy though. But, they are only counter height. I needed bar height so I have returned the stools."
4,"Awesome plant stands, not for sitting though...","First off, I must say the info on the stools is wrong. They're 26"", not 22"".Second, they are a chocolate brown color, and look awesome in my living room with the rest of the wood work and end tables. You could use them to sit on but why would you. They are sturdy but don't look like they can support a person comfortably and safely. But they do make great plant stands. They arrived packaged in bubble wrap. Not bad for the price. I recommend if you're looking for plant stands or for your patio but not to use for sitting. And they arrived at 26"" high, 2 sets. -R"
1,beware buyer,I have bought several publishings from this company. Each publishing is a endless circle of telling you to buy another one of there publishings. They offer a 100% garuntee and dont honor it. If you email them they might respond once and tell you that your refund was submitted to your credit card and it is your credit card companies fault you have not got your refund. Dont be scammed like me and many others. Never purchase any publishings by Martin J. Silverthorne.
3,Good Premise,"I found the ""concept"" of the novel very imaginative and original. The book was good overall but felt the conclusion of the book unsatisfying and unexplained. Loose ends were taken care of with a single ""gunshot."""
1,"No Flow, Didn't Care About the Character","I read all the good reviews and was looking forward to receiving this book. I was extremely disappointed. Although the premise was excellent, I found the story to be jumpy and hard to follow. Just when you got to know characters, it was time to move on. I kept waiting for the 'real' part to actually begin. There was no flow and I couldn't have cared less what happened to the hero in the end. I never even read the last 60 pages. I just couldn't do it."
3,Pretty Good,It is a short book filled with facts about World War II. It proved to be very intersting.
4,Clear but poor pronunciation,I bought this to improve my understanding of the Gita. The reader is American and easy to understand but has no idea of Sanskrit pronunciation. New age music in the background. Although this is irritating I am finding the CDs to be useful.
3,Decent Phone But Poor Sound Quality,"I have had the z525a for three (3) months now. I had to replace it because I received a message from Cingular that my Nokia 6190 (which served me flawlessly for six years) was about to be ""retired"".PROS:Beautiful designLots of featuresLong battery lifeGood receptionGood priceCONS:Sound quality is ""tinny"" (the 6190 was far superior)PTT button is very annoyingCamera takes cheesy quality photosBOTTOM LINE:A great phone for someone on a budget."
1,"Cute look, horrible phone",I picked this phone based on it's sized. I was happy with it for the first month or so but then it started to turn itself off for no reason. I am now on my second phone and it's starting to do the same thing. Unfortunely I'm stuck with this for another year before I can upgrade to a different brand. Very happy with Cingular service just not the phone.
1,HORRIBLE!,I HATE this phone! I got it as an insurance replacement for the Sony Z500 and I've already had THIS one replaced twice. The reception is terrible and the earpeice speaker is even worse. The last one the ear speaker stopped working all together after about 2 weeks. And don't even get me started with the ridiculous PTT button! Could they have put it in a worse place?
2,I've had better,"While I do like the fixed antenna feature and had looked forward to customizing my phone with the interchangable faceplate and battery cover, I was forced to switch phones due to horribly spotty reception (while my roommate got great service with a much older Cingular phone) and a very slow operating system. Also, the push-to-talk button is way too easy to accidentally push, and is an obnoxious reminder of the service even if you due opt to use it."
2,At least it's cool looking.,"Mistake. The reception on this phone is terrible. I've been with Cingular in the same location for over 10 years and have had 5 or more phones through their service. Previous phone was a Motorola V60, while not as fancy, the reception was twice as good. I have to walk outside of my house now to take a call. Not recommended."
1,Display blanks out,"Most people have covered the pros and cons of this phone in their reviews, I just wanted to add that this is the third time I've had to replace this exact phone and model due to the screen blanking out. It goes all white and while the phone still functions, you cannot see anything happening on the screen so no texting and you can't make a call unless you have the person's number memorized (and who does since the advent of the contacts list!)Would not recommend this phone at all. Needless to say I'm getting a different brand this time."
3,Lots of features but terrible reception,"The Sony Ericksson Z525 phone has lots of great features including a motorola bluetooth with the plan I purchased. However, the reception on the phone is terrible. When I speak on the phone, about every third word is cut out on both ends of the conversation. The wireless bluetooth for some reason does not work any longer and the phone cannot connect to it after only two weeks. There are better phones out there - this is not worth the money and time."
2,Was ok for a little while,"I got this phone from AT&T's store almost two years ago. It worked wonderfully and I loved it until just a couple weeks ago. I have read about it and almost everyone else who has gotten this phone had the same problem. The internal screen just stays completely white and won't change and the external is completely blue. They just won't change. The phone still works, you just can't see what you're doing. Overall, I would not recommend this phone if you are under a 2-year contract"
1,If you enjoy using your cell phone- don't buy this one!,I have had this phone for 2 years (stuck in a contract) and it is the worst phone I have ever had. I replaced the phone prior to the 30 days thinking I got a bad phone but the same problems occured with the new phone as well. I will never purchase a Sony Ericsson phone again. I have had the most dropped calls with this phone. The phone will lock or freeze in the middle of calls and I have to take out the battery and restart the phone- and my conversation. Sometimes after doing this the phone still doesn't work. It likes to take pictures when it is in my pocket or in my purse. It also doesn't always want to turn on or off. I have to hold down the button multiple times before it will even think about turning off/on. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.
4,"Pretty decent phone, a few flaws","I've used this phone for about 2 years now. It's fairly stolid. I haven't broken it yet. In terms of functionality, I could only wish it could send DTMF tones while in a call from the phonebook. The biggest annoyance about this phone is the camera button on the side; this location causes occasional random picture taking when the phone is kept in purses or pockets where the side camera button is easily triggered. The other +/-side button also sometimes causes problems (it can also be used to forward calls you don't want to pick up to voicemail when pressed and held while it's ringing). The problem is that sometimes when I try to answer a call I want to pick up, I accidentally trigger voicemail forwarding... The upside of the side +/- button is that I use it daily as an alarm snooze and it also controls call volume easily during calls."
4,Great for the price if you fix the PTT problem,"I got this phone a couple of days ago. The PTT button can drive you nuts every time you handle the phone. There is no way to keep from hitting it because ther is no way to disable it. Was ready to return the phone until I read some posts in the Cingular Sony Ericsson forum. After prying out the button and cutting off the little knob on the button, the button is noe diabled. I am not sure how people who use PTT will be able to stand this phone, however, since I do not use PTT, disbling works for me. Otherwise the phone is great."
1,Display kept breaking...,"I am on my third phone from them because each time it breaks, AT&T will only send me the same type of phone. They say that if it breaks one more time, they will send me a different type. The reason why I had to send my phones back was because the screens would stop displaying anything after a while. I know two friends that had the same phone and both encountered the same problems. The phone itself is easy to use and nice, but the display breaking so often is not very much fun..."
2,you get what you pay for,"I have had this phone for over a year and now rarely make phone calls due to the unreliability of this phone. On 3 of 4 calls made, it will, almost without fail, make a loud buzzing noise (able to be heard by both parties)and not reconnect to the line, causing you to have to disconnect and redial. Sometimes it doesn't even ring when I have an incoming call and I miss the few phone calls I still get. I have also met 2 other people with this phone through my work who absolutely hate it but, like me, are locked in because they can't afford to upgrade and their plans won't let them change. I have met one person who has it that has no problems with it at all. If you are looking for a cheap phone, you may not want to take your chances with this one"
2,"Bad phone, good features","So I had this one for almost a year now... within that year i've replace it twice! i hate the fact that the screen blanks out all the time. Good thing i had warranty on it or else i wouldn't get it for a second time. I'm mad because right not as we speak the screen is broken once again! for the second time! i love the fact that the phone has sooo many great features, and it works great but when it's dropped or turned off the screen will blank out. I still have my warranty for another month but i'm not willing to replace this phone for the 3rd time.. it's a waste of time! so if u need a good phone that will last more than a year then don't get this phone it will be a waste of your time!"
2,Do Not Purchase For Use With Your Car's Handsfree,"I purchased this phone for use in my 2006 Acura TL and its Bluetooth handsfree system. Unfortunatly, the phone is ""Quirky"" as the customer support person said. I say it does not work.The Sony represenative I talked with said the phone does not work well with Acura, BMW, Jeep, or Audi handsfree systems. In my car that meens it works fine for incoming calls using the hands free system - but it is unable to call out. All in all a major disapointment. I would avoid this phone if you would like to use it in this way."
2,PTT button is annoying - phone died after getting a bit wet,"The push to talk button is wrongly placed.I end up clicking it at least a couple of times a day and end up cancelling the ""Do you wish to initialize PTT?"" popup.Also the display part of the clam shell seems a bit fragile, shakes a bit unless you open it all the way to the end. I ordered it online at another site without trying it at a store. You might want to check one out personally before ordering it.Also the speaker adds a whole lotta noise to the conversation. Am plng to add a blue tooth headset to get over the speaker phone noise.--------------------------------------------------------------------------the phone is very flimsy...i have had instances where my nokia phones got wet inthe rains and worked perfectly fine. My friend even dropped his in a puddle and it started working after it dried up. This one just died on me. Very flimsy!"
1,Display died,"I've just finished calling AT&T yet again to say the display died on my phone. I had the first one for a few months before it happened. They replaced it. The second phone lasted only a couple of months before the same thing happened. I'm dead in the water without the display. I can't call anyone unless I know their number, can't see if I've missed a call or have a message, can't see if my battery needs charging. They won't give me a different model. And if I want a replacement in less than 5 business days, I have to pay $12 for shipping. I am a very unsatisfied customer and will ditch this phone as soon as I'm eligible for an upgrade."
3,Defective phone?,"I got this phone in April of this year with the recommendation that it had superior reception. Well, wrong. It gets tenuous reception at best. What my real problem with this model is that it is just plain defective! I went through 4 separate phone with 4 separate problems. I finally petitioned cingular for a different phone. Other than that I was happy with the ease of use (I'm no techie) apperance."
2,Avoid !,"Two of my friends had this phone. In both cases the phone died in the same fashion after 15 and 19 months. The screen went blank/ white and nothing could fix it. If you do a web search on Z520 blank screen, you can find that a good chucnk of these phone have this problem!Good luck!"
1,Horrible refurbished-like phone,"Pros: nice user interface, highly customizable.Cons: horribly cheap outside design; when the phone is closed, you can see how poorly the flip is aligned; when you open the flip, you always have to wait about one or two seconds until the phone turns itself on; every time you speak on the phone, the Push-To-Talk (PTT) button gets pressed due to the way one is likely to hold the phone.This is one of the worst GSM phones that I've ever seen. When will Cingular start selling proper Sony Ericsson phones like K800i, W800i, W810i or W950i?"
3,Climbing The Mountains Of Madness...,"HIGH LANE (aka: VERTIGE) is about a group of rock climbers who venture into the Croatian mountains. All is well until horrible ""accidents"" befall them, and they begin running into a series of deadly traps. HIGH LANE is a DESCENT / WRONG TURN-type hybrid. I liked most of this movie, right up to the point when the feral madman is revealed. Yes, he's ""bonkers"". He just isn't all that terrifying. His lair is rather creepy, but nothing we haven't grown to expect from these sort of guys. Still, HL is worth a peek..."
4,Not a Bad Part Two,"The BBC sucked me in with their Planet Earth program when it first aired on American television. On the strength of that product alone I went and purchased both of these BBC High-Definition Natural History Collections. With both of them, the main feature (in this case, ""Life"") is obviously very well done and enjoyable to view. The others are more 4 star quality programs and don't feel as satisfying as watching the main offering.If you're into nature documentaries at all, the full set of Collection 1 and 2 may be an amazing start to your own disc based collection."
1,DIFFICULT BOOK FOR BEGINNERS!,"I found this book to be difficult especially since I have never learned anything about anatomy before. I do not recommend that a novice to anatomy buy this book. It would be better for someone that has already learned anatomy or a professional because it's a condensced version of the muscles and their actions. The material is sometimes too general or too wordy, which makes for difficult memorization and learning. The CD-ROM videos are good, but the rest of the material on the CD is already in the book. The quizzes at the back of the book are somewhat helpful with learning the material."
2,Just OK,"I got this book because of the combination of text and DVD. I had to try the CD-rom on 3 computers before I was able to install it. Once installed, I wasn't thrilled with the videos. I thought I'd get snippets of athletes in motion with audio to go with it, but it's just shots of a single person performing a muslce action multiple times(adduction, abduction, etc.) The activity examples given in the text were good, but in all I wouldn't recommend this for trying to learn muscle anatomy. Not worth the $40."
5,Get it for the CD,Get this book for the CD. It allows you to pick exercises and see what muscles are involved. It's wonderful.
2,Informative but boring,"Can't we lay out our super informative books like ""for dummies""....Maybe that's what I need. I just want to pass a group exercise test...not go be a professional doctor. I know this is a truly educational book...but I wish it was laid out a little more for the non-scientific minds..."
1,Simply awful,"The title is a tipoff of what to expect, since Verne never wrote about a rocket to the moon. (The adventurers in ""From the Earth to the Moon"" were launched from a 900-foot long cannon.) This movie, like the title, has little to do with Verne... or good storytelling, for that matter. Adding insult to injury, as others have noted, the video transfer is lousy. Want Verne? Read a book. Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
3,Clear and Easy to use Reference,"Suitable for the everage user who needs to improve his/her mastery of the language. It not only covers grammar, usage and punctuation, but also has a section on the writing process - an added bonus! But what I like most about this book is that it has clear explanation on Traditional Grammar and Functional Grammar so that the reader would have a clearer picture on what grammar really is."
4,Fun Book,My daughter moved a year ago to Holland and got me this book. It has great comments into the Dutch people and some of their cooking techniques. It offers a variety of recipes for thier Hotchpotch and Dutch oven cooking. Entertaining as well as some great recipes.
1,"Immoral behavior, Violence,Secular progressive point of view","My son chose this book for an 'outside reading' book report and while I agree, it was exciting and action-packed, it also validated immoral behavior and was violence packed as well. The message 'implied' by the author is inexcusable material for children's reading and in my opinion is VERY inappropriate. If it were a movie, it would be at least PG13, but more likely rated R for violence. The book is dark, sinister, and has an extremely negative message regarding our country, our president, and our realtionship to other nations around the world. I regret that my son read it before I did and I will definitely not make any further purchases of books by this author."
2,Mediocre Book With Stupid Ending,I had a good mindset goin into this book because all of the other books in the Alex Rider series were pretty good and his new book Raven's Gate was pretty good to. But I was suprised when I read the book at how much different it was. It wasn't good at all it was just OK. Then the ending came and it was extremely bad. I would not reccomend this book to anyone!
1,Amazing,A great adventure. I can not stop reading it. I love the other alex rider books also i have all of them.
1,this is such a boring book,"this book is nothing but blah blah blah. it gave my son nightmares and the cliffhangers are boring. we all know alex is going to survive, okay? if you faint at the sight of gasoline, or are prone to vomiting when somebody is talking to you, do not read this book."
4,Scorpia,The fourth book in the Alex Rider series had the most captavating plot yet and seemed slightly more realistic. By countinuing this series I believe that Anthony Horwitz can only destroy the belief of Alex Rider.
4,alex does it again and ends with a bullet in his tummy,this is a great book but it seems that its not as good as the others.buy stormbreaker
5,Very good book,"I read this book last summer. I have read all of Horowitz's other books and this, by far, has the most surprizing ending! I highly recomend this book."
5,Scorpia,Ugdhcdgdydhdjdh eddy subduedEffects tagged Gregg gcvtc g f2f chef. Cc f2f v. G cc x. Gandhi. Cc g v
4,why not cheeper,why 12 bucks! what the heck. It is a great book though. i think that this is the best scires ever made.
5,Awesome,This is the best book of the series. You have to read this book. I only wish point blank was better
4,Not Your Regular Spy Story,"This novel explores Alex Rider's dark side. It is a fascinating read and the author seems more creative in his approach than in the previous novels. As always, the action moves quickly and the suspense is high. The Alex Rider series is one of the best series for teenage boys being written right now."
5,By far the best book of Alex Rider,"I read this book years ago, and this is the only Alex Rider book I can come back to read. Don't get me wrong they are all great for all ages, but Scorpia is a masterpiece. This is the only book of the series (not counting the last one that comes out in a month) that has a special twist and gives the reader a different setting and story. Can't wait for the last one to come out!!"
4,Jake on Scorpia,"I have read Anthony Horowitz books before but had stopped for a long time. I recently had to read a book for a class in high school and I choose to read the book Scorpia since it was the only Anthony Horowitz book that I have not read. I thought the book was kind of boring in the beginning because it started with Alex Rider going on a vacation and then ends up working for M16 for no reason. But what made this Alex Rider book different from the others is that he ended up working for some body else for one week. That helped him figure out what had happened to his parents. This book does put you on the edge of your seat because of all the action, and how it all turns out in the end."
5,the best of the best :),"By far Anthoney Horowitz has written one of the best, top-selling book series ever!Alex Rider is awsome! I think scorpia is one of the best of his works!!I really liked Niles character, even though he's evil. The plot of most of the Alex Rider books gets me so excited, one time fell asleep reading! If you are a reluctant reader in grade 5 or up, you'll love Alex Rider. Even if you're in grade 4, you could still handle it (I did beacause I was Reading R.A. Salvatore books in second grade!). I hope you will enjoy this series!!!"
4,Scorpia,This book is great. It picks up and we again are on a whirl wind ride with kid spy Alex Rider. In this book he learns secrects about his past and has to make a tough discion about his future. I reccomend it!
4,A great addition to the series,"Scorpia is the fifth book in the Alex Rider series. In this book Alex goes vacationing in Italy. While in Italy, he discovers an evil organization called Scorpia. When the leader of Scorpia tells Alex that his father was once in Scorpia, Alex decides that he wants to join so he can follow his father's footsteps. Scorpia sends Alex to kill someone at MI6. MI6 finds out what Scorpia is up to so they try and stop them. Scorpia is going to try and kill a lot of people with a plan that they call Invisible Sword. In this book you find out a lot more information about Alex's uncle and Alex's father. Read this book if you want find out all the surprises in this book.I liked this book because it kept my attention. There was talking, but the things that they talked about made me want to read on.I recommend this book to someone who might not like reading that much. This book keeps your attention and I would say that it makes reading fun."
5,"Horowitz, you have done it again!!!","Anthony Horowitz has definitely created a masterpiece here. This book is simply the best. If you're into action, read this. Alex Rider, a reluctant MI6 teenage spy, is now chasing his parents' history. Alex Rider has many surprises with Scorpio, the organisation mentioned to him by Yassen just before his death. An action packed book which even has one final twist in the last few pages. I just couldn't put it down. BRILLIANT!!!!!!!"
5,"Love, love, love them!","I love these bowls. The little one is great for side dishes and the big one is nice for a main course, as long as you aren't feeding tons of people. Mine arrived undamaged. They hold up so well!"
3,Arrived smashed!,"Would have liked these, since I have the larger one, but they arrived totally smashed due to inadequate packaging. Got a refund at least."
1,Useless for large print jobs,"First of all, the wrong picture is posted. The Q2443B is a small unit that fits on top of the 4200/4300 printer; it's not a full-size 'finisher' as shown.Now, while this is described as a ""500 sheet stapler/stacker"" please be aware that it is limited to just *15 page* staple jobs! So it's useless for large print jobs. And, as for 'stacking' it's no different than a regular output bin, i.e., don't expect it to do sorting or even off-setting (placing each print job shifted to the side so that you can easily find them separately)."
4,Greendale by Neil Young,"You'll either love it or hate it, but it is quintessential Neil Young. A welcome addition to my library!"
1,Neil Yawn and Lazy Horse,"Remember ""Weld""? Remember ""Ragged Glory""? Remember ""Everyone Knows This Is Nowhere""?Well, keep remembering because there is nothing like that here. I have been listening to this album for a week and keep falling asleep by track two or three.I wonder - is there any way to euthanize a recording?"
2,dog dislikes it,"The problem with this item is the constant tension on the cable, always pulling on your dog, and being off the ground it ends up across her face when she turns or gets under one leg or another. If the cable were on the ground it wouldn't be a problem but the rewind tension keeps it up to her chest where it attaches to her collar.I ended up attaching vice grips to the cable after pulling it all the way out to keep it from retracting.It does what it says and seems sturdy enough. Dog just doesn't like it. She's an Australian shepherd at about 50 lbs."
3,Bigger Packed,"I'm a International customer and the size of the box increase dramatically the price of the final shipping, and this company refuse to send this item in a different package just for include advertisement and catalogs of his products. This advertisements cost to me a lot of extra money.By the other hand, this item arrives in good conditions and at time."
3,More style than substance,"Stumbling upon this book at the library, I looked forward to reading it. It's short, and focuses much more on fancy graphics than advice - which means it looks cool but doesn't say a whole lot. You can read it in less than 30 minutes, even after looking at the pictures! The advice starts out on the topic of sex and then moves into relationships - I found the sex advice to be the most fun and most shocking (in a good way), and the relationship advice to be pretty weak. Not surprising, I suppose, when you consider the author's occupation! A fun read, but nothing here you can't get in a more thorough book."
3,Photogenic!,"The Player's Handbook is a hybrid of graphical photography and straightforward dating advice for female ""player's"". The graphics are of the variety found in chic magazines. Moreover, one gets a sense of cool while browsing through the pages. Her advice is honest and most likely taken from accounts of her own life. I give it 3 1/2 stars. Nothing earthshaking, yet simple and elegant enough to purchase as a gift (you might wanna purchase a used copy though)."
2,Hmmm,Took eight and a half minutes to read the entire book. Quips are mostly based on common sense approach to the opposite sex. Nothing really new...but there are pictures. wow lol
3,Good to read when you just broke up with a jerk,"When you realize you've been played, this book is a good book to read and know that if you choose you can also play others. I don't think being a player is a great thing, but this book will just remind you that you can do the same, with some self-respect and dignity, if you choose. The format is cheesy. It's not worth the price. Actually I don't recommend purchasing it. But I recommend flipping through it for the nuggets of wisdom. My favorite page is the vending machine - ""[Something] A Plenty"" with varying sizes of equipment inside. It puts things into perspective nicely."
5,Players handbook review,"That book is so cool. I call it the Bible! I would like to buy more copies for my friends. I only had it a couple weeks and a friend already borrowed it. wonder if I'll ever get it back.it was a good transaction, it arrived on time and was in good condition."
5,Certainly Award Winning!!!!!,"Ladies and Gentlemen,It's a Great Book in a small size. It talks less but teaches a lot. You get entertained and educated while you go through pages of one of The Top Topics in Our Lives - Man and Woman relationship.I'd say it is a brand new approach to publishing.This is a good example of low budget, but award deserving book.Amassing combination of colors and incredible flow of various style illustrations.Custom made outfit for single page theme...Simply unbelievable...So much creativity, so much energy, so much enthusiasm....Shocking, surprising, admiring....What a great teamwork.Congratulations!!!!"
3,My review,"Ordered one size and it was a little too tight, exchanged it for one size up and now its too big in the waist."
3,Once and Future Cousineau,"People who say that a book was ""not what I expected"" are unfair. After all, an author can hardly be faulted for other people's expectations. In this case, however, the expectations were raised by the author himself. I began by reading chapter 2, an outstanding, thought-provoking chapter on the myths of time. I bought the book on the strength of this chapter, and ended up sorely disappointed. The rest of the book is far less compelling, and often is annoyingly self-focused. Cousineau's recitals of all the important people he has met and known in the great places he has visited work neither as a good memoir nor as a good book on myth (although, in fairness, there are a number of worthwhile passages and a few excellent ones)."
1,ott-lite true lite replacement bulb 18 watt,"I have been having problems with the correct 18 watt bulb.It does not fit into my lamp.I have returned this bulb twice. Last bulb sent back Jan.16,2013. In fact they sent me 2 bulbs which I did not request. The model on my lamp is 00119353. I have had this lamp for about 13 years,bought from Jo-ann's Fabric. They could not replace this bulb because they discontire this model. So I was told to contact off-lite. The bill was $49.98,which was paid MC.returned 1-16-13 2 bulbs1201 E. 12th ave.North Kansas city,Mo.64116authorization #813-6210058/FLNorth Kansas city,64116."
5,OTT-LITE TRUECOLOR REPLACEMENT BULB,WHEN MINE BURNED OUT I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE I COULD ORDER THROUGHAMAZON....NO FUSS..NO MUSS..AS USUAL. VERY HAPPY WITH MOST EVERYTHINGI BUY THROUGH AMAZON.
2,LASTED ONLY ABOUT 7 MONTHS---,"I purchased this item from Amazon on 02/21/2010 but the bulb is dead already. Under the technical detail, the company claims that it will last 10,000 hours, which is equivalent to more than 416 days of straight use, but it wasn't true for me. I believe I used it less than 1,000 hours..."
2,Dissapointing,"After having read and enjoyed Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, I was eager to gobble up another title from Sijie. Whereas I was immediately drawn into Balzac, I just couldn't find myself ever getting into the story of Mr. Muo. It just ambled along, with infrequent glimpses of the genius I saw in Balzac. This story never gets off the ground, and the ending was very much a disappointment. Skip this one, read Sijie's first novel instead."
3,"Convoluted, enjoyable tale","This is the story of a man trying to get the woman he loved (unrequittedly) in college out of jail. The characters are likeable, and I really enjoy this author's writing style. I didn't mind the meandering nature of the plot - except for one thing. The story didn't seem to have an ending, it just seemed to reach a certain point of convolutedness and then stop. For that reason, I'm not able to give this book a higher rating."
3,Long strange trip,"This was one of the strangest books I have read. The Virgin's Dilemma could have been an alternate title. If you don't mind most of the book having to do with a very out of place man, trying to rescue his ""virgin"" sweetie form jail, while wrestling with his virginity and asking about the virginity of various young women he meets, this is the book for you."
2,What the....!!??,I have no idea what this book is all about. Completely unintelligible. The other reviews seem to have been written about some other novel. Skip it!
5,There will never be another Spike Jones,"It's difficult to write this review, because I haven't stopped laughing since I put the first of the four excellent discs into my player. I've been a fan of Spike Jones since I was a kid, but being in Australia, we never got to see any of his TV appearances in the Colgate and other shows. These DVDs bring out the best of Spike's comic genius. The comedy sketches are a bit old fashioned and the rather 'in your face' commercials pushing tooth paste and cleaning agents in the Colgate shows we could do without, but the musical items are an absolute gem. Spike may have murdered the classics, but he and his masterful musicians provided an entertainment that the world desperately needs, moreso today than it ever did. Regardless of the commercials and comedy sketches which seem slow and ponderous by today's standards, the four discs in this pack are excellent value. If you don't get at least a dozen laughs out of all the discs, you'd better have your pulse checked."
4,Craftwise Volume 1: Candle Magick,I enjoyed watching this informative video on candle magick! This one was a AWESOME video because the presenter Petter Paddon gives the right mixture of information and humour. I have order other videos on spells and candle magick and some were so MIND NUMBING BORING that I had a hard time staying awake let alone be interested in watching - the others were very close to a Hollywood movie feel! I will be ordering the rest of The Craftwise Series!!!!Craftwise Volume 1: Candle Magick
1,Does not detangle,"This product does not detangle my hair at all! I bought this at my local drugstore in place of my usual Biolage leave in tonic when it wasn't available. I will say it may have added a bit of volume to my hair when used before blow-drying, but it's not worth ripping out my hair after i shower. Will not purchase again or recommend."
1,Nut butter balls,These had a bizarre flavor and a chalky consistency. Neither my husband nor I liked them so we gave them away.
5,Delicious,Delicious. Those that normally eat whole grains and nuts will enjoy them. Great for the summer hike or beach since they don't melt.
5,Warning-These are addictive,"Probably the best vegan treat I've had. Nice consistency and mouth feel. Packed with nuts, flavor (and calories)."
4,Good But!!,"I have only one complaint. Where Eileen is not direct in confronting James. She is established as a strong direct character and in this one instance she deviates from that character. This deviation from character, of course, sets up the rest of the book but was unbelieveable."
5,If you like Madeline Hunter and other smart authors...Read This!,"I cannot believe I am the first to write a review of this amazing novel. I just finished my second reading of this book and absolutley loved it, again!! If you like smart romance novels, with great history and fabulous story telling, this is your book. It is not a sexcapade, but is very sensual. Most of all, the story of Eileen and Neil races along and grips the reader. Have fun!"
2,It promised so much but didn't really deliver,"Okay come on why do we buy romance novels? Because we really like the mushy stuff right. Well it really wasn't there. I enjoyed the plot and thought that the book had so much potential but I was sorely disappointed that Eileen keeps Neil at bay so long and when finally she surrenders to his love she is forcefully kept away from him almost the entire time. And Neil falls in love with her so fast, there is no wooing or soft kisses. Or even much professions of passionate love, and when they finally do come around to making love it's over just like that. I must say I was pretty bored. It felt like I was reading a good historical novel but not a romance. Dissapointing to say the least."
5,The Dude,"An Essential Rap Record for all those who enjoy just some smooth/cool gangsta shh... Everything about this album has already been said earlier. Just do yourself the favor and cop it. His BEST, in my opinion.P.S. Make sure you play this LOUD when driving around. Peace!"
3,Funny,"This guy has the funniest rap style ever, in the history of rap music. He really doesn't rap. He sing raps in that sleazy way of his.I do like ""Sticky Green"" w/Scarface, ""Georgy"", ""Don't Wait""w/DMG & Spice 1, & ""Like A Sweet"" w/Scarface,Jugg Mugg and a couple others. He works best with guests. It's a funny album though. Buy it if you wanna laugh!hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha whooo!"
5,DEVIN THE DUDE,"yo that devin cd is off the hinges. He is one of the best rap artist to come out of the dirty south no doubt. forget no limit records or cash money cause the boys from rap a lot have been here for years and with artist like devin will stay on top in tha dirty. he's lyrics are great and the beats are just perfect for him. this cd is the sleeper of the year forget about it. put the cd in and don't worry about skipping any of the tracks they're all tight. ""do what you do"" devin i will always buy your cd's"
4,Too Short Make room for Devin the Dude!,"Its a shame when someone like Devin has been around for so long and does not get any recognition. Well on this album he hasn't changed much from his ways of old. His lyrical content reminds me of a smoother Too Short. I know alot of people will disagree but he may be better. Although the album consist of the usual alcohol, weed, and women, Devin does deliver knowledge that a tru rap head can appreciate. He also give views on how he live his life and how people will look down on you no matter what you do."
5,Shine Man Adds Light to the Holidays,"This story of finding the divine in people during the Great Depression is a gentle way of helping children (and their adult loved ones)focus on what's most important about the holiday season. Illustrations are reminiscent of Dickens, but set in the 1930's in this country. I'll think of this story (especially the last two pages)when I behold the stars in a bright December sky."
3,Touching story,"It has a good ""Do unto others"" message, and would be a good Christmas book to read to your children."
1,Plastic Cases,"Make sure you are aware these cases are for CASSETTE tapes. I ordered them thinking they were the old VHS tape holders and boy was I surprised. Now I have 25 dollars thrown down the drain. I was needing VHS holders for a project in my classroom.Oh well, live and learn."
4,Cool,its cute deck with cute images. the booklet has each card meaning with little cute easy spells. overall its cute deck and easy to go with. the spells are simply to-do kind of spells and cute to be done.
3,Do not buy it.,It is the first thing to break on the Super Cub.Fly your Super Cub Without it and it will fly just fine. Save your money for your next Airplane.
4,good,it was good and it worked great.when buying i suggest buying more than one.it is a cheap part that breakes easily and often.
4,Lively Leads & No Hiss,"'Louis Armstrong And King Oliver' should be considered a preview of the Hot Fives & Sevens that was to come. Armstrong's first recordings with King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band are more ensemble oriented. He's the second cornet to King Oliver's cornet. (The cornet was a predecessor to the modern trumpet.) The double cornet breaks make for some lively dancehall jazz. . . This one also has seven tracks from the Red Onion Jazz Babies. They hail from Armstrong's first stint in New York City. ""Cake Walking Babies From Home"" is some of the earliest magic that Armstrong put to wax. This version is worth the price of admission. . . The sound quality for these 1923/1924 recordings is terrific. The early 90's compact disc are a lot better than the 1980's cassette of this material. This release does justice to the early recorded work of Louis Armstrong."
3,"Superceded, in part","This CD contains the Gennett, not the Okeh sides, less than half of the seminal early 78's recorded by Joe Oliver & Louis Armstrong. The two-CD set on Challenge includes all of these important early recordings of African American jazz music, re-mastered by the late great John R.T. Davies. To my ears, the Challenge set offers enormously better sound quality. And, oddly enough, it's cheaper on Amazon than the Milestone product, at least at this writing. But caveat emptor! I have seen a bootleg of the Challenge set floating around the used jazz bins in Chicago.However, enthusiasts of the young Louis Armstrong may want to consider this CD for its inclusion of the Red Onion Jazz Babies sides, prototypes, you might say, of the Hot Five's and Hot Seven's. I don't know where else these might be available on CD. And these transfers, for some reason, are a bit more listenable on the Milestone issue than are the King Oliver numbers."
1,"Lousy Sound -- Get ""Complete Set""","You can hear from the Windows Media samples that the tracks have been filtered to death. A much more vibrant transcription of the same recordings is the wonderful ""King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set""."
3,Better than nothing,"It's a nice look at Yogananda but its very short and there is not enough details on his life, the last part is a short slide show with shots of places he has been. It's nice to see but I was wanting more info and live shots of him talking.It's better then nothing but it would be nice to see a livetape of his talks.I recomend it for informed followers who are just happy to get a glimpse of the Great Teacher.He is an incrediable teacher and I suggest reading Man's Eternal Quest, and Yogananda's interpetation of the Gita.God Bless. Hope this helped."
5,intreaguing novel! time for a hollywood movie?,I'm thinking its time for Akitada Sugawara to make his big-screen debut! Anyone agree? Asano Tadanobu as Akitada maybe??? ;-)
2,Disappointed,Tora Tora Tora. Always getting lost; always finding a poor defenceless waif as in susequant novels. He just takes up way too much of the plot for me.
3,Awkward and stilted,"I agree with the previous reviewer who said ""It is the perfect book to read at the beach or on a plane. The writing is not very deep, vivid or profound."" It's OK, but nothing more. The mystery is very obvious and I found the writing very stilted and awkward-as if it were a translation by someone who was not very comfortable with English. Nor did I learn very much about the customs of the time. I am very thankful I borrowed it from the library."
4,"Very good guitar, but jazz is Byrd's best muse.","I don't regret buying this CD at all. I was looking for some of Byrd's recording that were not bossa nova, and there should be a place for this one in any collection of Charlie Byrd recordings. The recordings and performances are well done, but they just are not ""Charlie Byrd"", though. If you are looking specifically for classical guitar, consider Andres Segovia, Julian Bream or John Williams before moving on to this CD."
1,disk two unwatchable in this package of Vigilante Western Collection,the Vigiante western collection -- the dvd comes with two disks the disk two with three of the movies is so fussy and out of focus you can not watch any of the movies so you really only get two movies in the disk. not really sells fault yet they should be responcable for what they sell
1,ONE BIG BLUR,"AND GOD SAID TO CAIN is the worst looking one of this bunch---akin to having glacoma, the dupe is so bad; even 1950s tv kinascopes look better.WHITE COMMANCHE is the 2nd bad looking one of the bunch, and it's very much a USA movie, starring william shatner of all people.The other movies were made in spain/italy, with KEOMA having joan baez or some joan baez wannabe singing the god-awful title tune.there really are other five movies for under five dollars collections that are better than this."
1,old boring movies,"If youre looking for western action movies, these are old tv movies, old black and white bad quality and boring. I think so."
1,This was a gross disappointment,I had purchased Rowan's Legacy with this cd and it was like night and day. I actually threw it away and Lil Wayne is the only other artist to share that mark of indistinction. I like Rice and Rowan but this was a mess and no song saved the puddle.
4,Love Music? Love Chops? Get this Album!,"I'm not a big bluegrass fan - I have a handful of albums in my collection. But I CAN listen to almost any genre (sorry, rappers) when it's apparent that the musicians know what they're doing and do it with panache. And that's what's happening here. What a treat 'Quartet' is! Awesome playing, authentic, seasoned vocals, and great tunes.Whether you're a bluegrass lover, or just love good music done well, check this one out - it's close to ""Perfection""!"
2,Judas Kiss,This movie had a lot of unnecessary nudity and a lot of bad language. Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman were the best part of this movie and were very believeable as Americans. Alan Rickman never gives a bad performance no matter how bad the movie is.
5,Refreshing,"The film is incredible. It never gets dull. The cast is powerful and complex. It stimulates the mind, body, & soul. Carla Gugino (Coco) is spectacular. She is the fire of the film which is enforced with her attire. - RED - Fabulous script and settings. You could not pick a better location then New Orleans, LA!"
2,Rent it first,"Buy this only is you're crazy about Alan Rickman or Emma Thompson. The two British actors are the best part about this movie made in the Deep South but neither one of them has enough screen time. Their New Orleans' accents are passable and their roles are out of the ordinary. The movie's premise is good, but the flashback techniques slow it down. The gratuitous sex scenes don't do a lot for it, either. Fortunately, Rickman, Thompson and abductee Greg Wise reunite in ""Sense and Sensibility,"" a movie anyone would be proud to own."
3,"Oh, the ACCENTS!!!!!","I'm gonna start and say I did enjoy the movie, but Alan & Emma seriously could've used a good dialect coach. I'm from New Orleans, the majority of us do not talk like that! Alan's never been good at playing American accents, there's always a hint of his British that pokes through, but he did give a solid performance."
2,"Stock characters, stock plot, not much Emma T","Well, I watched this movie. I watched the bad accents, the gratuitous sex. the insipid characters (or caricatures). There is the tired cop and the cynical FBI agent, the Police Captain who seems to want the case solved but then does everything he can to block progress, and the US Senator who blusters about justice on TV but about &#145;pulling every string I can get you fired&#146; in private.The plot involves a kidnapping that goes awry and the centers mostly on the grifters as they try to make things right get the loot and not get caught. It was a forgettable group with the typical wackoo muscle guy and the Harvard intellectual and staring a pair of low-life lovers hoping for the big score.Don&#146;t waste your time getting this movie for 10 minutes of Emma Thompson."
1,God awful.,"There's a dialect coach listed in the credits, and her license should be yanked. And burned. Those accents are the worst I've ever heard in any number of crappy movies set in New Orleans. To be fair, maybe the plot was worthwhile, or maybe the performances got better as things developed. But we couldn't listen to it for more than 10 minutes."
2,What on earth were they thinking???,"I understand Emma Thompson was pressed to read this screenplay at an event and was instantly interested. She then persuaded her friend Alan Rickman to become involved. What on earth were they thinking??? It's hard to believe that the woman who wrote the brilliant screenplay for ""Sense and Sensibility"" could have been impressed with this dud. Thompson is my favorite actress and Rickman is my favorite actor, but, oh my God, the accents are terrible! I used to say I would pay to hear Rickman read the phonebook but I would want that money back if he used THIS accent. Rickman can now sympathize with his co-star Kevin Costner's laughable attempt at a British accent in Robin Hood! There is nothing new in this plot, and the sex scenes give new meaning to gratuitous. Save your money...but if you adore the velvet voice of Alan Rickman speaking the King's English as no one else can, listen to his audiobook recording of ""The Return of the Native""...over 15 hours of ecstacy!!"
1,Only If You Love Alan or Emma,"Only watch this movie if you're a fan of Alan Rickman or Emma Thompson (however their roles aren't that big), and maybe Simon Baker. The rest of the cast is forgettable and the story is so-so. Alan puts his usual droll and entertaining spin on his cop character (how many bad cups of coffee can he choke down?) and Emma is very funny as an FBI agent. It was fun to keep tabs on who had the more believable N'awlins accent (it changed from scene to scene) and I really wished those two had more action together."
5,Made me forget I was ironing!!,"And since I dislike ironing, I would give this 10 stars if I could. Engrossing plot and twists; great lines and acting. Can Hollywood please take note and make more films like this. And advertize them as if they were Jurassic Park III. Yeah, I should wakeup now, huh? :)"
4,Spider's Web,"Aside from the language, I found this movie engaging. It was fun trying to figure things out with the clues. I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone but I was surprised at the ending. The characters were interesting. Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson had believable accents and their repartee was interesting and, at times, funny. Carla Gugino was very good in her role. Simon Baker's character was so different from the roles I'm used to seeing him play. Be sure to watch the movie until the very end."
3,A must for fans of Alan Rickman and/or Emma Thompson,"This thriller is better watched for the undeniable chemistry between Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman than for anything else. That said, that's more than most movies have going for them."
2,No glass,"The product description clearly states that the pillars come with glass to block the wind. Assuming the first shipment with no glass was a mistake, Amazon sent another set. Still no glass. Luckily, the person who received the item was able to find a glass cylander from a craft store to fit inside. However, the pillar is definitely not worth the money."
5,some good info. seems a bit outdated,"I read through the entire book. There were some sections that were a little politically correct for my stomache. Some sections that I really didn't agree with. Some sections were a bit out dated. They didn't agree with my training. However the several chapters that wen't through what to say, and the mediums with which to say them make the book worth the price 2 times over."
1,Useless,"The batteries arrived earlier than expected, which was great. They lasted for 2days and died."
3,Last book of the jewel trilogy,"Amber is the last book of the jewel trilogy, i would give this book a great review but in all honesty i only read it because i was not going to leave the trilogy unread but this book was not up to scratch in my opinion.Storyline was decent but this will not be one of the good friends that i put back in the shelf to revisit later.This story follows the last sibling Kendra Chase, determined not to marry a duke, but that is exactley what happens. He is handsomebut he has secrets that he keeps from her. Can Kendra learn to love a duke?"
4,It was enough,I'm not saying it was not good but it was not great however I did give it four stars because it kept my attention. The hero and heroine have a lot to do trust and loyalty. My only real probelm was when the hero had to return home and we have yet another mystery to sovle when I'm not even sure about the first mystery of why he was a highwaymen. Any way I liked the other characters and so I plan to read the other books.
4,Much more engaging a read than AMETHYST,"Lauren Royal's, AMETHYST had me dying to reach the end because personally I found it lacking in spirit. Amethyst was a silly twit of a girl with far too many romantic notions, however Colin and his family made the story worth my time...that and the fact that once started, I cannot leave a book unfinished. I was intrigued enough about the other Chases to read AMBER...which I found to be entertaining and full of spirit where AMETHYST was not. Kendra was strong-willed and possessed more backbone than Amethyst had shown in Royal's debut. Trick was interesting and realistic, yet still maintaining the fantastic image, fiction readers crave. A lot more impressive this time Ms.Royal! Cannot wait to read Violet and Emerald!"
5,Great read!,"Great book and series! I really enjoyed this series, this book imparticular. The Kendra is so funny and Trick makes a great highwayman and Duke. (Although I think I like him as a highwayman best :) )"
5,great,A funny-exciting adventure filled series. The characters are very real with great love filled hearts. Definate reading materiAl. Imaging the homes/castles was easy.
3,A good overview of the Normandy Invasion.,"This is a good overview from the British perspective of the Normandy Invasion. Gilbert points out that Churchill prepared the way for a return to France after the defeat in France. He did this by fostering the French Resistance, making guerrilla raids on the coast, and letting the captive population know the real news. When the Americans did enter the war, the British led the way in leadership on the invasion. Gilbert insists that it was not Churchill who was a critic of the French option rather than the soft under belly of Europe.Gilbert does a good job of portraying the strategy of the invasion, rather than of the actual fighting. The actual invasion is covered in only three of the ten chapters. The rest details the preparation and the end result. As Gilbert reminds us, if the invasion had failed, the population of Europe might have led very different lives. A good read."
2,"Lists, quotes and anecdotes","Lists, quotes and corporate anecdotes pretty much sum up this book. It's light reading and quirky, but I didn't walk away with a single idea to take to my team at work."
5,Maybe not that well known but it should be,"I actually stumbled on here looking for the album cover on Pagan Irish and saw no-one has written a review. That just makes no sense because this is truly an awesome album. It has been around awhile. I used to listen to it heaps and know every song really well. Now and again, I get a song come up on my random playlist and still really enjoy it. Some songs have a soulful blues feel - other quite a joyful bluegrass feel. They all have unmistakable Celtic texture with his rich Irish lilt - and inspiring lyrics - which is what makes ithe album such a great mix. I don't know much about Kieran Kennedy although just looking now I see he on MySpace. I see he has another album Foxymoron so I am off to check it out. Used to look for a new album years ago but gave up so good news to have discovered it. If you like original singer songwriter with irish feel but still contemporary - Pagan Irish is for you!"
5,A Travel Addict's Fix,"Aficianados of travel books will delight in ""Dead Men Don't Leave Tips"".Travel is truly an art mastered by few and Brandon Wilson reveals an expertise that inspires. His rich descriptions transport the reader into the unfamiliar and his ability to delve into the cultural core of the humanity he encounters is sure to nourish the spirit.His writing style is a hybrid of Paul Theroux and Tom Robbins, combining the raw frankness and keen observation of Theroux with the intelligent humor and playful language of Robbins.Africa offers travelers the height of potentiality and Brandon Wilson embraces opportunity with constant relish. Readers who have a penchant for traveling will happily devour this book and be sorry it ended. I was!"
3,Interesting adventures that need some editing,"Brandown Wilson shares some interesting stories but suffers greatly from self-publishing. His choice to publish this without the trained eye of an editor short circuits some interesting tales.Travel in Africa is never easy and Wilson does include the difficulties of travel with a group, especially with people one hasn't previously met. But the stories seem to have no cohesion, and often, no real conclusion. We lurch from tale to tale in this travelogue.Travel in difficult circumstances can often lead to self-reflection. Some of my favorite writings find the author learning lessons of self and humanity through their adventures. Unfortunately, Wilson seems to learn little more than the physical aspects of Africa."
3,Dead Men Don't Leave Tips: Adventures X Africa,"I purchased this book for my husband who only reads non-fiction. He stated that it is ""dry"" and written like a diary. It is not engaging nor funny. I hope he picks it back up to finishe reading...or I guess I will to feel we got our monies worth."
3,A compelling read with some good belly laughs!,"I climbed right into Brandon Wilson's boots and was sad to have to jump out at journey's end. I think what made this such an engaging read was that it was not written by a well-known author, but an average joe on a quest for deeper life experience, so I could relate. Like many of our favourite travel writers, Wilson is sensitive yet intrepid, insightful, with a dry crusty sense of humour, and he paints a colourful portrait of a mysterious land and the characters he runs into along the way. Though there were definitely issues in the editing/proofreading dept, it was still a most compelling read!"
2,Not a good example of Africa travel writing,"I really wanted to like this book. I love stories of Africa, having lived in both Tanzania and Zimbabwe. Furthermore, I am originally from Hawaii, where the author lives, so I was enthused for the book and open to read about the author's experiences.I'm sorry to say, the book did not meet my expectations. The author is inconsistent. he glosses over interesting parts quickly, yet spends way too much time griping about his fellow travelers. He makes countless errors, as well. He sometimes comes across as arrogant, due to his put downs of other travelers. Simply put, he focuses on all the wrong aspects of the journey and the result is that the story is simply not enjoyable.There are much better books about Africa out there. Skip this one."
1,My New Wash Cloth!,"Gets Dirty Really Fast, And After A Few Washes, It Start's To Fade (pretty soon i had a plain white shirt), But Hey, At Least It Looked Cool For Awhile."
5,Awesome book for anyone looking to learn low-level,"This book fills in most gaps you might encounter while learning about the low-level BSD/Mach aspect of Mac OS X and Darwin. Mach and BSD iokit is described in detail, and there are tons of useful code examples all over the book. This book even explains ipc and pipes very well, and isn't the size of the bible, like other books. It gets to the point as soon as you get past the TOC."
4,Odd format... great content... scary title,"When I first received this book, I was intimidated by the advanced topics in the table of contents and also the format of the book. It looked painfully dry and highly complicated, but as I started reading the book, I realized it is very reader-friendly. This books very well describes the unix tools for version control, testing, and development. There is a very useful chapter on subversion which gives enough introduction to get things rolling. It also provides topics on os X technologies that you won't find in other books such as Bonjour, Multi-Processing, and Keychain management. I think it is an essential complement to any Cocoa development book.Advanced topics are described with a very easy language and I was able to read almost half of the book in a few days, and trust me, I'm a slow reader. I recommend this book to all Mac OS X programmers and Cocoa Aficionados."
4,A bit dated but excellent content,"A must have for any serious MAC OS developer. Written in 2005, some of the content in this book is dated, mostly those chapters related to Frameworks and performance tools. However the book mostly focuses on the internals of MAC OS which is a mature unix platform that hardly ever changes over the years. Therefore most of the content in this book is still very much relevant to current MAC OS."
4,A great resource,"Don't expect to learn to code from this book, but once you know how this book will help you solve any problems that you run across.I don't think that I'll ever read it cover-to-cover, but I know that it will always be in my library."
2,Not very useful,Not that useful for my trip: didn't show rail lines or have inset maps of major cities.
1,Buyer beware,I purchased this dvd a while back and when I tried playing it found out it was a blank DVD! I have called and emailed te company serveral times since then but have no response.$29.99 for a Blank dvd is a pretty expensive price.
5,Beautiful Losers is a Winner!,"Beautiful Losers is a touching piece. It gave me insight into these artists' lifestyles. They seemed to believe they were outsiders, but they were the ones who shaped a whole new movement of pop culture. They continued to impress me through out the film with their ambitious, unique, similar minds and talent to create art. It was fun to watch and made me remember that I was once a creative person who can just as easily become creative again."
4,Pursuit of DB Cooper,"This is a good action film. Lots of fun. I was the Location Manager on this picture and we made two moves while filming. WE shot about half the film in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and the other half in Tucson, AZ. Believe it or not, when Treat William jumps out of the plane, he actually lands on Mt. Lemmon here in Tucson. I had lots of fun working on it and I think it turned out really good. If you like older, action films with lots of humor, you will like the film. Something to look for...The rapids were in Jackson and when they went over the falls, that was actually done...with doubles, of course. Also, we rented the Baseball Padres 727-100 and I had to get permission from the FAA to open the back so he could jump out. You will have fun with this film and I recommend it highly."
3,A Bit like Smokey and the Bandit,"This movie was okay, I was kind of hoping for a bit more truth to it. There was one scene where my hubby and I looked at each other with a 'what the heck' look. Parts of it seemed a bit like Smokey and the Bandit. A lot of extra characters and car chases. Was pretty disappointed."
1,nice moments but there are better film composers,"Philip Glass is a good composer. I can't say i hated all of the soundtrack. When he doesn't go back to the minimalist patterns there are some moments of beauty. But most of the time i must say the music was too melodramatic and moving when the film didn't ask for such texture.This CD might be something nice to hear on your free ""I love philip Glass"" time.But as a Soundtrack i think it made the film more romantic than it is.I must say the hours worked better."
3,Rangefinder BY newcon,"Nice range finder, but the cons are as follows. First... you can't see anything in dim light. Numbers are not illuminated. So good daylight is the only time to use it. Second, I had used mine once and it broke; so get the warranty because you'll need it. For the price; not bad. Just don't expect much."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,I adored this film as a child and as an adult I still love it and find myself humming the songs on occasion. I have seen numerous film versions of The Wind in the Willows and this one is something special. (I enjoy the Cosgrove Hall TV series as a TV series but still find this to be the best film adaptation of the original book.) The voices are perfect for the characters and the songs range from humorous to moving. My original copy of this film was taped from TV and even with commercials and severe weather warnings it was watched again and again. I now have the VHS and find I enjoy the humor in the film even more now that I am an adult and can appreciate the quality of this production.They just don't make animated films like this anymore. It has so much of the Edwardian spirit of the novel and the dignity... no wise-cracking sidekicks or modern slang.It is almost criminal that this has never been released on DVD. A new generation deserves to experience it!
5,Blues at it`s best,"This is a Great album! if You like listning to root blues performers like Mississippi John Hurt or Lightning Hopkins, this is one for You!"
5,An excellent book to read aloud to your children.,"The chapters are just the right length for reading aloud to your children - at bedtime, or whenever you want to spend quality time with them. The illustrations accurately conveyed my impressions of how the characters should appear. My son was 4 1/2 when we read ""The Secret of Council Hill"", and he was very attentive. He is now five, and has been waiting with bated breath (as have I) for the sequel, ""The Secret of Spring Mill"", and now that it is ""out"" and we have ordered it, we are anxious to continue on our adventures with Beth and Ryan. As a parent who reads to his son every day, I highly recommend Mr. Arnold's work."
3,Better books available,"My AP Language students found this boring to read and so did I. ""The Language of Composition"" by Shea, et al. is an infinitely better text, more readable and more directed at the AP Language test with great examples and essays that illustrate the main points."
4,Everyday Use:Rhetoric at Work in Reading and Writing,I needed the book for class and it has helped in writing my assignments.Expensive book for a High school class though.
2,"It works in a way, but I don't trust it","I bought this a year ago at what was then an incredibly low price.My internal data drive crashed about 3 months ago and this saved my life. All my backup data was restored!Nevertheless, the software is poor. It barely works. It does not reliably delete previous backups, and my Maxtor is now almost full, but shouldn't be. In addition Maxtor has a bad reputation for reliability.I just ordered a Fantom Green Drive to replace it because the Maxtor scares me."
3,This CD was ok.,I thought this CD was a lot of the same. I expected a little bit more variety but it is still worth listening to.
4,Great Banjo Spectacular,I first heard about this CD on the Ellen DeGeneres Show. The band performed and had me hooked. I am very pleased with the CD. I thoroughly enjoy every track.
5,Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular,"Bluegrass at its best! Toe tappin', ear to ear grinnin', you can smell the mountain air from here entertainment!"
3,Incorrect Advertising,"I've bought virtually every Euro-thriller and Spaghetti western that Pop Flix has issued because some of the titles are difficult to locate and often come in the letterboxed format. The ""Mafia Kingpin"" DVD collection advertises ""The Master Touch"" as a widescreen print, but it turned out to be Full screen when I played it on the Blu-Ray player. I checked ""Violent Naples"" and ""The Cynic, the Rat, and the Fist"" and both of them are in widescreen. I've been searching for a widescreen print of ""The Master Touch"" for years, but I haven't found one yet. I wasn't concerned about the other Jack Palance movies on the second disc. It is really a shame that ""The Master Touch"" was not presented in widescreen because the cinematography was done by ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" lenser Tonino delli Colli. If you're searching for a widescreen copy of ""The Master Touch"" don't make the same mistake that I made. I am happy about ""Violent Naples"" and ""The Cynic, the Rat, and the Fist."""
1,Washed out picture + Terrible acting + Bad action scenes,"The picture is washed out. The acting is stiff, and clumsy. It's terrible. The action scenes look awkward.In short, it's a waste of money. I bought it on sale from the local Walmart. I gave it to charity after that."
3,So-So,"I was disappointed in this book. Way too much time was spent on telling you how to build your own self-esteem. Some of the review exercises are overly simplistic. I emailed a work situation and question to the author; she replied that she charges $85 for a one hour telephone consultation fee. Hmmm, $85 plus the $20 I already spent on the book. Sorry, not worth it, even at only the book cost."
3,pretty good,"The narrator of the book, Richard Samuels, says he is an Honors English student. Why then, I wondered, would he make such a stupid grammatical error as he does with the TITLE of the book? Kaplow's love of, and knowledge of, the era, is encyclopedic, and this shines through. The premise is intriguing and the book well-written. There was, however, a contemporary feeling to the book: I didn't for a minute believe I was in the 1930s, even with all the attention paid to period detail. And either Mr. Kaplow or his proofreader needs a proofreader: the Mercury Theater actor Martin Gabel did not spell his last name like the glorious Clark."
2,"Authentic?? Sounds ""corny"" to me!!","This book is said to make one feel the texture, smells and sounds of NYC in the 30's so I was put off by corn appearing as a ""street food"" - maybe in other cities - ( I did see it in Belgrade during the late summer of 1973) However to have steaming corn during a season when people wear warm fur coats??? Be real!! Pretzels- yes; roasted chestnuts - yes; true, I may have missed something that is otherwise good but corn on the streets of NYC in cold weather as common street food strains credulity and ruined this book for me. Perhaps if it had not been praised for authenticity (which is what I was looking for) I might have accepted this as a trivial point but not under the circumstances."
5,FINELY WROUGHT,"Last week I discovered Kaplow's work through the Wall Street Journal article on Lilian Jackson Braun. I read Kaplow's parody ""The Cat Who Killed Lilian Jackson Braun"" which was a broad and highly enjoyable sex-farce. On the basis of that I bought ""Me and Orson Welles"" which is really a remarkable novel. Not only was it funny and fast-paced, but there was something genuine at its core: a mediation on a young man's dreams of glory. The story is lightning fast, dramatic, and highly compelling. I read it in two sittings. It's a glorious short novel: bright and thought-provoking. And it's also one of the best portraits of celebrity monsters I've ever read. Welles comes off as both brilliant and a bastard. Highly recommend this one."
2,Poorly written,I thought it would be better. It kind of seems like the kind of story one would write in a creative writing class in high school but some 200 pages longer.
3,"Interesting, if a bit prosaic","While I'm a big fan of erotica, and have enjoyed several of the Mammoth books over the years, I found myself thinking ""same old, same old"" while perusing this volume. Sure there are gems from many of my favorite authors (Rachel Kramer Bussel, Simon Sheppard, Cheyenne Blue, Cecilia Tan), but there also were a few that didn't float my boat. Real standouts included the amazing ""Swimmer's Body"" by respected author, Patrick Califia, and the funny ""The End of Daphne Greenwood's Travel Career"" by Tara Alton.Overall, a good, solid read that won't disappoint."
5,BEYOND OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS GAME IS PROBALLY THE BEST SOCCCER GAME EVER MADE. ALTOUGH THE WORLD CUP IS OVER, IT WILL LIVE FOR EVER WITH THIS GAME.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,An excelent resource for fans of The Seventh Seal RPG,"This is player's guide to the Role Playing Game The Seventh Seal is an invaluable resource to players and game masters alike. It reveals three new archangels that the player characters can owe allegiance to; it gives insight into the creation of realistic, round characters, and it fleshes out the background of the Seventh Seal world.The one drawback is that much of the material in the book might have been better suited to a Game Master's Guide. Some of the revelations in this book could unbalance the game, or give away secrets better kept for the GM only.This is an outstanding book, and is a must for any fan of The Seventh Seal. But, GM's be warned: take a look at this book before your players do."
4,Braun energy cells,I purchased the Braun curling iron last year and to my surprise after several months no store around my area carried the energy cells. This made the new curling iron useless. I looked around for several months. They all discontinued selling the energy cells.When I had purchased these cells before the price was outrageous just for 2. I looked on line and sure enough I found the cells on Amazon for such a great price and for 6 cells no less. I will continue to purchase my Braun energy cells from Amazon.
5,Great find for pacemaker patients,"I have trouble finding these cells in stores. Walgreens stopped carrying them about a year ago, and Ulta rarely has them in stock. Having a pacemaker and being advised not to get an electical curling iron close to the device, the cordless Braun has met my need to style my hair. Now I have found this source to replace my cells. I will say that this is not a year's worth for me - probably 4-5 months. But the price is great, and the frustration for the search is over!"
4,braun refil year order,"If you don't use this product all the time it could be a year, but this is used every day and it is about 6 months worth. But it1 Year Supply of Braun CT2 Hair Styler Energy Cells, 6 Energy Cellsis great to find a supplier because the stores here no longer carry it."
5,Fair prices,The items were as descibed and the price was fair. I've purchased them before and probably will again. also good service from the vendor.
4,"Great product, but boxes opened","I have been using Braun butane cartridges for years, buying them either in the store or on-line but this time the cartridges arrived with all of the boxes opened (the seals were broken) making me wonder why? Were these seconds or refills? I haven't used one yet but I hope they work."
3,beware leaky cells,"Great to find this product. Unavailable in retail stores. This curling iron is great for travel, but also everyday use as you are unlikely to burn yourself, which is a real problem with the electric cord curling irons. So happy to have refills. But BEWARE!! I have put cells in my Braun cordless, carefully turning it off, and found the cell empty of fluid in the morning, three times in a row. This never happened before. So now I take the iron apart. The Butane is highly flammable. Where is it going??"
3,"Pretty basic, doesn't include nut","This is a pretty basic piece that works just fine. Note that it does NOT include a nut to attach either end, but that it's a standard part you can buy at a local hardware store."
1,2-Lamp Socket,"The socket is quite light weight, even on the flimsy side. Of the four purchased, one was different from the others and arrived broken. With insufficient time to make an exchange, I purchased an alternative elsewhere."
3,Business as usual,Its a nice peek into the industry for those that are not part of it. As exagerrated as parts of it may sound its rather mild compared to things that could occur.Its all from a writers standpoint so perhaps this is from their side of the fence.
1,Pages in 2003 edition are way too small,"From what I can see, the content is the same as the 1994 edition, however, the pages are so small that many illustrations are printed over onto 2 pages. The colors are better in the 1994 edition also.Buy the 1994 edition, it is beautifully illustrated, with descriptions are complete, without boring you too much information."
4,Lovely But Limited,"This book is set up differently from others I've seen in that it is divided into categories such as plants, animals, water, etc. The result is an easier reference than some other books I've used. Definitions are well-written.... as if the author is speaking with you rather than dictating dry facts. The illustrations are lovely, too. On the downside, the illustrations take up space that may otherwise have been used for additional listings. This book is, I think, a matter of quality over quantity, which is fine for me."
5,We are mentioned-it hits home-a must read !,"We, Joanne & Ralph Cline, are mentioned in this book. After reading the book a couple of times we personally believe that DeGarmo & Tartaglia have hit the biggest reason people join Network companies like Shaklee,,,it is Heart to Heart,,,and that makes this world revolve. After almost 3 decades in Network Marketing we feel people considering joining our industry would be well advised to read this book. It is an easy read in simple language. After you read it you will understand why we have been involved in Network Marketing for almost 3 decades. We are in our mid seventies and looking forward to the next 30 years in the business."
4,Good for someone who knows what's what...,"I've never taken a bellydance class or used another video and this one got me a bit lost. I enjoyed the parts I could follow, but this is not a video for the novice. I got lost and frustrated and so it's gone back on the shelf until I get a good beginners video. I liked the moves library, but I wasn't able to get enough into the moves to give an honest opinion of the actual workout."
1,This has mostly clips from other dvd's,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. Her workout was very poorly cued (as usual) and a lot of her ""extras"" were just clips from her other DVD's. There is no amount of money she could pay me to endorse this DVD. I was getting excited about trying this dvd but her lack of energy and enthusiasm really made me feel like she didn't love her workout, if she can't love her workout then what would motivate me to try to be like her?"
3,Where's the dancing?,"i don't recomend this dvd for beginners at all. The cardio workout is complicated and and the moves/combinations aren't explained. after a few tries i sort of got the hang of it but i still wasn't happy about how it wasn't a coherent dance; there were just too many pauses. the individual isolation workouts i really enjoy and have had fun creating my own workouts every day, but i still don't feel like i'm dancing."
2,bellydance video,Either I don't know how to work my DVD player or this DVD is very hard to follow or defective. I have become uninterestedand frustrated. When I can get to an excercise it's okay but still not very easy to follow. I have been wanting to return it just have not had time. Thanks
3,A bit disappointed,"I have the other videos from Rania and had hoped that the cardio would be a new sequence, it was not. The cardio sequence comprises extractions from her other fitness dvds hip hop hip drop, cardio shimmy, too hip, pure sweat. The combining of these serves no purpose for me in this dvd.To get a workout I select customize your workout in order to get my workout.Rania is an awesome instructor and I hope that she produces a dvd with a fresh challenging cardio session that is fun, challenging and lasts for at least 50 minutes .Don't buy if you have her other fitness dvds.Buy if you don't have her other dvds"
5,Great to workout with,"I enjoy working out with Rania. This incorporates her other videos into this one DVD. It has a 30 minute cardio belly dance routine made up of her best cardio workouts and it has several 10 minute segments of her by herself doing a routine with you. It offers set programs you can choose from for your workout depending upon your time schedule. Even if you don't know how to belly dance, just review her how to section to learn the move and you are on your way. If only she had a 10 minute shimmy workout though. I would be extremely happy with that."
4,Useful if you already own Rania DVDs,"I have several other Rania DVDs and videos. This one is NOT an original DVD, but a cut-and-paste product from her prior videos. It would be useful to someone who owned the other videos and just wanted a pre-made, quickie, slap-together workout from them for each day of the week. If you don't own Rania's other videos, though, you could easily get confused, as the instruction is minimal at best. So yes, you might want to purchase this video, but in my opinion you'll get more from it if you purchase Rania's other videos first."
2,Look elsewhere,"This DVD was just silly. The workout was pretty good but the things that bothered me were her 'lunges' were always with the same leg and if I had been able to do this more times I would have really noticed it I'm sure. The chapters were too short by the time you worked up to a good heart rate it was over! This was just bad. Unfortunately I've found that to be true with these workout DVD's that have the 'chapter workouts' to give lazies the false hope that a 10 minute workout 3/ week is sufficient. Oh, the best part is that the lighting is off also~ you can see the girls are wearing makeup on their abs to make them look like 6 packs. I am not surprized by this but its pretty tacky looking. LMAO!"
2,"The idea is good, but...","I really like the idea of this dvd. I have Shiva Rea's ""Yoga Shakti"" and it has a great interactive, customize your own workout kind of thing. But with this dvd, you have to click on what you want, do it, then go and click the next segment, rather than allowing you to chose all and workout sequentially. Maybe mine's defective?The cardio routine is okay. If I hadn't taken belly dancing for 2 years, I would have been completely lost. She moves quickly from sequence to sequence without really explaining what and how to do it. It takes a few times to get it. I actually just did my own dance routines when I got lost. I would recommend that anyone who doesn't have belly dancing experience look over the video library and watch the workouts first.The flexibility training section stinks--get a good yoga dvd for flexibility. The other workout segments are okay.Rania and her dancers are kind of cheesy. In general, I wish I had saved the money."
2,Revising preveious opinion,At first I was disappointed by this DVD. Seemed like a rehash of previous DVD's. And it is. But they are cleverly clipped and spliced to make over 50 different workouts and like 8 different training tracks. I must say I've warmed up to this DVD now I quite enjoy it.
4,I love it!,"I just got this DVD and that is why I gave it 4 stars. I have used it twice and let e tell ya I feel the burn. I am currently taking bellydance classes and I wanted something to follow inbetween classes. I was also hoping to get a great workout. With this DVD I found both aspects I was looking for. I think the instruction is great Rania is very easy to follow. YOu may not get it at first, but you will get it if you keep trying. I'm glad it's not too easy. I also worked up a sweat and could feel my muscles burning. That's what I was looking for."
2,Disappointing Quality!,"I purchased this product as a gift to my sister and was severely disappointed to learn that the whole binder was poorly assembled. I relied on the quality of Martha Stewart and her company's products but what I received was the binder clearly fallen out of the bookcover. Unfortunately, I did not learn this until after I gifted the book to my sister as I received the product in pre-shrinked wrap. Again, I would caution consumers from this product as you will be sorely disappointed in its quality."
1,Ring and Spine Separation,"I bought this book as a gift for my fiancee. This evening in front of her family, the rings and spine separated. This has happened to other reviewers (check the 1-star reviews).This book is not the long-lasting, keepsake type of book I had hoped it would be."
4,"Good Planner, But","A very good wedding planner, the 3-hole puch style is very practical and comfortable to use. It is a very well organized book with a lot of useful tips, timelines, checklists, etc.It covers every aspect in the long way to these remarkable days. The different chapters include: Getting Started, Guests and invitations, Stationery, Fashion & Beauty, Ceremony, Reception, Flowers, Music, Photography and up to the Honeymoon.In all fairness, few sections needed a little more attention like the reception.The flower section is by far the best and the most detailed section, with a lot of color photos of flowers."
3,I found a better one,"Ok so I've been looking for the right binder for a while. I'm doing an Indian wedding so I wanted something that can cover ALL the questions. ""The Bride's Essential Wedding Planner - Deluxe edition"" by Amy Nebens is a better one.I was almost sold on getting this book the till I went to the bookstore to see it 1st.Cons:- No index- too many useless pictures. You can find that on the internet or in magazines with more variety.- not enough substancePros:The color scheme. It's pretty.I eventually bought ""The Bride's Essential Wedding Planner - Deluxe edition"" by Amy Nebens for almost the same price. Pros on that one are: how to write thank you notes, invitations, etc. checklists, photo poses list, money saving tips,etc. It just seemed more practical for me than alot of same filler pictures that I can get from the internet. Con: No magazine pictures, but I can add those :)Hope this helps."
1,Horrible!,"Just to be clear, I've never before been so upset with an item that I felt the need to leave a review to warn others.Problems with this item:1. Many of the pages (especially the photos) are available on the Martha Weddings website.2. The first time I opened the binder the rings broke off from the binding.3. The information is mostly useless.I actually went to register at JC Penny's this weekend and the binder they gave me for FREE was 100 times better than this one!"
3,OK - not impressed,I gave this 3 stars only because of the floral section - the photo pages of different colors/types of flowers were great. Mine came damaged and after looking through the rest of the content I decided it wasn't worth exchanging and just returned it. I prefer online planning sites and excel to photocopying pages and writing details like guest addresses out by hand.
1,Avoid this one - shoddy quality,I bought this for my daughter and it started to fall apart not long after we bought it. My daughter was in tears and felt cheated. The marriage is also not going well. I think she blames Martha.
4,"Great content, cheap binder","First, it arrived with one of the rivets broken (completely sealed - just broken) so I had to fasten another one on to keep everything together. The contents of the binder are wonderful - great ideas, planning tips, and something I can write notes with to pass on to my children. I wish the folders in the back were higher quality, one of them I had to turn into a brochure holder because the excess glue inside prevented full size papers from fitting properly. All in all, I don't regret the purchase and it has a lot of helpful information, just poor quality."
1,Bad manufacturing - DON'T BUY,"This planner has all the content I wanted, but the manufacturing is terrible. The top rivet on the binder broke after less than three weeks, so I ordered a replacement. The replacement arrived broken. Very disappointing. Amazon did well, however; they said they would refund my money and pull the item."
3,Not for non traditional,"Unlike some of the shared reviews, my book came in perfect condition. However once I looked at it I realized that it was not for me. This is more set up for a coulpe that is having a really tradional wedding. If you want something more simple or you are from a small town, this might not be what you are looking for."
1,Ongoing defective product,This review is written with a heavy heart. I am devoted to Martha Stewart products. This product does not meet the high standards that are typical of the brand. The Planner arrived and upon opening we found the center post was not attached to the cover.The Planner was returned and a new one was sent. Sadly the same problem was observed before the shrink wrap was removed.That one was returned as well. We will go to a brick and mortar store to find a useable Planner.
2,A little disappointed,"The content was light and there were only 5 folder pockets in the binder for storage. Would've been nice if they had one for every category in the book, ex. flowers, cake, reception, food, etc. It is nice to have a binder for all this but more of an organizer would've been better. I expected more from Martha, more ideas, more pictures. Just More."
3,Not sure if it works,This shampoo is supposed to stop hair loss in ten days. Not sure if it does that or not. Been using it for approximately 1 month maybe longer. I always had short hair so it never got stuck in the drain to notice a difference. I have a feeling that it probably does not work since it does not say anything on the bottle about hair loss or hair growth.It does smell nice and my hair is definitely clean.If nothing else works for you then give it a try. I figured for the price if nothing else I had a bottle of shampoo.
4,I like it,I like that shampoo ..I think it would be much better if you use conditioner with it ..Thanks .
2,Makes no changes in hair loss after one plus month of use,After a month plus of used. Did not notice any changes in hair loss. Continue to lose hair as usual
5,Great product,This shampoo is an excellent product. My wife has been using it for many years to prevent hair falling. It does a great job on scalp and hair. We recommend it.
3,Good book,"There are not many books about adolescent nutrition, but this one is very complete. It is a little old, but the information is really good."
3,"Good, but not...","These bearings are good, but they take longer then a normal bearing to break in. But thats not why I gave it three stars. I gave it three stars because for the price they just aren't worth it. I have 2 sets of reds bearings. They spin smoother and longer then these, and for much less. So They are good, but if Your gonna want good bearings, get reds..."
2,Not worth it,One of my friends sold me some new swiss bones and there no better than the cheap ABEC 7 i bought for $15.00
3,Bearings,They did not come in perfect condition one of the bearings rolls roughly. I tried re-lubricating them and it did nothing. Overall I am kind of disappointed with the condition of the bearings.
5,Best bearings out there.,"I have been riding Bones Swiss for 20+ years and they never disappoint. Sometimes they're too fast, if that's possible."
3,A tutorial on USB to PS/2 adaptors,"OK, folks, listen up. There are two kinds of USB - PS/2 adapters. There's this kind, which simply changes one plug for another. It doesn't do any signal processing at all - it's just a dumb plug changer. For most of you, this will not work, because in order to use a PS/2 keyboard with a USB plug in the back of your computer, your adapter needs to change the signal somewhat. That's why you see the more expensive adapters - about $12 to $15. Those have circuitry inside them that actually changes the PS/2 output of your keyboard into a signal that the USB input of your computer will recognize. I learned this the hard way, too."
2,REPLACEMENT adapter,"The description here does not tell the whole story. The manufacturer's website states:""This product is designed as a replacement adapter for keyboards that originally shipped with a PS/2 to USB converter. If your product did not ship with a converter, we suggest trying a USBPS2PC instead.""I believe this is why the other reviewers are complaining that the product doesn't work. I'm going to buy the ""USBPS2PC"", which I also found on Amazon (product number B00028OP2Y)."
1,Frustration,"These PS2-USB ""adapters"" are the worst thing to ever come from mankind. Why? All they do is switch over wires to a different plug. They do not ""magically"" make ps2 products usb compatible or the other way around. Almost never in the product description is this told. Many people have bought these to be very disappointed that they don't work. On the other hand, if you know you have a compatible keyboard, they work well. Make sure your keyboard states it's compatible with usb-ps2 adapters before buying an adapter! The work of actually converting formats is done by the keyboard, not the ""adapter""."
1,Bottomline: It does not work with either of my PS2 keyboards,"When plugged into an USB port, windows XP complains that the device cannot be recognized. I tried both USB 1.1 and USB 2.0 ports on an old compaq presario and new dell computers. The same problem."
1,"It didn't work for me, either","I should have paid more attention to the reviews as this didn't work for me, either. I got the same message, doesn't recognize usb. I don't know if there could be a driver for this. I don't think the product is necessarily defective, it just doesn't work with Windows XP."
1,Waste of money,"Amazon should remove usless products such as these from their warehouse, what is the point of this product if the whole intent behind the buyers purchase, is that it will work turn a ps2 keyboard into a USB keyboard? Waste of money, I leared the hard way to read the reviews first, but amazon should take proactive steps to remove clutter such as this.Bottom line - this is the type of product you would expect from skymall."
1,wellllllllll,I tried one of these cute little adapters and it did not work so I got a replacement and it did not work either. After the first one did not work I ordered another brand and it is working beautifully. I would definitely stay away from this product.
1,It didn't work.,For some reason it did not work. I plugged my keyboard into it and inserted it in my computer but it would not make the keyboard work
1,Usb adapter,Well I am not happy I ordered this item paid more for shipping then the item and when I hooked it up it doesn't work.I can see the light come on on the keyboard but it goes out right away. So the connection is bad so it doesn't work.But to return it would be a waste of time and money cause its just not worth it.
3,wrong desc,description wrongone two three fourfive six seven eightqwertywaswaswaswaswasan not here there fore
1,Don't buy this piece of garbage.,This item doesn't work.I don't understand why the seller sent me this terrible thing.He has no professionalism in his job and duty.
1,PS2 to USB Keyboard Adapter,Product did not work for my application. Bought a new Dell PC & didn't like the new keyboard. Bought this adapter so I could use my old keyboard....no go. Could not get it to work.
1,did not work as stated,"Well when I plugged it into my computer I was given an error message stating this is an unrecognizable usb device. Not worth the money I paid for it, not worth the hassle of sending it back. Live & learn.If it is real cheap there must be a reason. They don't work so had to buy a usb keyboard anyway. Wasted my time with the adapter."
2,If you have to pay freight -- go local. Freight costs more than item.,"Unless you are a prime member - go buy this locally. There is nothing ""wrong"" with it - but the freight costs more than the adapter itself."
1,Connector fails to work,Do not waste your money on this. It is not worth my time to even return it. Does not work on my HP laptop running Windows XP SP2 nor on my Vista (as a test).
2,Adapter for keyboard,This item did not help with my problem. I will keep it and press on. I was trying to use it to hookup an external keyboard for a laptop. My laptop rejected it.
2,Don't order this to install a keyboard,"Well, I ran into the same problems that are described in the other reviews. I guess I should have read them before I ordered two of them. It pays to read the reviews my friends. I think I will always read them from now on."
1,Does not work,"Product does not work. It is a waste of money. The product was very inexpensive, but they killed you on the shipping. Again this product does not work, don't waste your money."
1,This product is for sale but not obtainable!,"Do not try to buy this adapter. Amazon shows it for sale but the supplier ""brilliantstore"" states that it does not and will not have it available.Amazon refers you to brilliantstore and BS refers you to Amazon. A classic ""Catch 22"". My msgs to Amazon Cust Svc telling them to stop offering this product have not been answered.To begin with (BS) sent me a mouse adapter, not a keyboard adapter. They are willing to refund my purchase (if I remove my previous ""poor"" review) but that's not the point. You simply can't buy this item!I accidentally gave this item a 1-star. It's zero stars but I can't correct it now."
1,Just doesn't work,"Though I have a keyboard that should meet the standards for this device, which are that it is designed to work either as PS2 or USB and that it came with an adaptor, this simply did not work."
1,Misrepresented,Does not work with a keyboard. The seller didn't say that.Do not buy this to use for any keyboard. It works with a mouse only.
1,Waste of money,I ordered two of these devices so that the great keyboard I have that is PS/2 would work with my new computer.Neither of them worked.I took them to work with me where we have a large quantity of keyboards to test these with.Same thing.Do not waste any time or money thinking these will work for you.
1,Aggg...should have read the poor reviews...clicked too fast...,"I should have read the poor reviews. I wanted to go back to an older familiar keyboard, did a quick check on male/female and the color code and quickly hit click. This can't be complicated right? Quick, move on. Wait for adapter. Surprise! This won't work! They really should be clear in the description - IF YOU HAVE THIS ALREADY AND IT WORKS, HERE'S A ""REPLACEMENT"" LIKE IN THE TITLE. It won't work for anyone else as it lacks the smarts to actually convert a PS2 signal into a USB signal. It's just a physical plug for people who already had the smarts in their PCs (usually from factory) to do this. No drivers on the web either to get around this."
1,Didn't Work,"Apparently, not all keyboards with PS2-type cables can be connected to a USB port with a simple adaptor like this. My keyboard was only 2-3 years old, so we weren't dealing with an ancient device, but it failed to work with this adaptor. I suggest that, if you want to attach a keyboard with a PS2 connector to a PC with a USB port, you do some investigating to see if just using an adaptor will work for it."
1,This item does not work,"I purchased this item to replace on older Radio Shack item. I was happy to see the product was much smaller, no long wire going from the PS2 to the USB. However, the product failed to work. No matter what I tried, I could not get the keyboard to work. I wound up buying another one from Radio Shack"
2,Not for Dell PCs,"I purchased 20 of these devices to convert PS2 Russian keyboards for a language classroom. We purchased new Dells that no longer have PS2 ports. Since the keyboards are so expensive, we decided to purchase converters instead of adding the PS2 board. I tried 6 of the converters on 4 different Dell computers and every USB port on the PCs. If it was detected at all, I received an error that it wasn't going to work properly and, sure enough, the keyboards weren't recognized. So I sent them back to Amazon and purchased dual splitters instead - and they worked perfectly. I have to comment that Amazon was a joy in the return process. I've never had to return anything before. I've always been hesitant about purchasing certain items for fear of the return process in the event I wasn't happy. But, this experience has proved to me that I don't have to worry. Thank you Amazon!!!"
1,who needs it?,"It does not connect ps2 keyboards with the usb computer 'cause it is ""passive"" device... No information about it both on the box and on the amazon's web page. Moreover, the device is called ""Keyboard Adapter""! It is a piece of junk. I sent it back despite it was cheap."
1,adapter,Did not work the keyboard does not function with this adapter. Product did not give any warnings it was not compatible with certain brands.
1,Live and Learn,"So *this* is why the guy on the big auction site is practically giving these things away, with free shipping - they're useless.(And he stuck an extra one in the package - I think he just wants to free up the storage space taken up by a bazillion of these doodads.)So head on over there if you're (like me) dumb enough to invest in one of these. Hey, you'll get an extra one to throw in a Christmas stocking of a relative that gave you that tie last year!"
1,Junk,"New Win7 machine does not recognize this device. Keyboard is recognized with a different adapter; therefore, the problem appears to be the adapter."
2,Not for MAC,"I have a lot of old keyboards lying around my house and rather than buy a brand new keyboard, I figured I'd save some money and buy an adapter instead.When I got it, I tried using it with my MAC (OSX 10.5.8) and it didn't recognize it. I tried with three separate keyboards and none of them worked. I haven't touched it since, so I don't know if it's a problem with the keyboard, my computer, or the adapter. I haven't tried it with a Windows machine either.My advice is if you're looking to use this for a MAC, either go and spend a little more money for a working adapter, do your research, or buy a new keyboard."
1,unfortunate review,The item did not work. I took it to Best Buy who verified that it didn't work. It only cost less than $2.00 so I am not concerned with it.I write this to help others who might plan to depend on it.
3,didn't work,"got this to be able to use my old, comfortable keyboard on my new computer since i didn't want to use the computer's wireless keyboard, but couldn't get it to work. It might not be the adapter, but the computer."
2,DOES NOT WORK WELL,The product does not do a true translation of the keyboard.Although it was inexpensive you are better off spending a few more dollars and buying a new keyboard.
1,"Hmm, wish i would of read the other reviews before ordering","Yup, doesn't work....i should of read the reviews to know this would not convert my old keyboard to work with my new computer, shucks!!!! well it was only 5 bucks, guess it will just go in the usless computer drawer i have never to be used at all."
1,it does not work.,It does not work. It connects fine but the keyboard does not work. They should advertise that for some computers it does not work.
3,OK adapter,"Although this adapter fits well, I expected it to allow me to use a PS/2 keyboard in a USB slot. The adapter allowed me to plug the keyboard in but I did not get functionality - my bad."
2,The picture doesn't show the true item!,"I needed the male and you sent me the female.The picture on the site doesn't really show if it's male or female.And the description doesn't say, male or female!"
1,Keyboard replacement didn't replace.,This adapter would not connect any working PS/2 keyboard to the USB port on either of the two PCs I needed to connect. Very unsatisfactory.I solved my problem with a different (keyboard & mouse) adapter.
1,Product does not work.,As simple as the product seems. It did not work with my microsoft keyboard. The keyboard itself works well with the computer. But when connected using the PS2 to USB converter there are driver issues. The keyboard is not recognized as a valid USB device and hence does not work.
1,Does not work,I should have read more reviews before I bought it.It does not work for my keyboard with a PS2 plug.
1,Does not work with Dell keyboard,I bought this because py PS2 port stopped working and instead of buying a new USB keyboard I bought this. So i Plugged my PS2 keyboard into this and then into the USB port but it just doesn't work at all. The computer can't even recognize it as being plugged in!!!
1,It didn't work for me.....,"I was attempting to use this to connect a PS2 keyboard to my HP Workstation, and then move the mouse and keyboard to a KVM Switch. It just doesn't work- I tried connecting it every USB port on the computer, and neither Ubuntu 10.04 or Windows XP Pro could find it. Save a little money here, and purchase something a bit more expensive, but functional-[...] USB TO PS/2 KEYBOARD ( USBPS2PC ) is what ultimately worked for me."
2,Might not work on factory USB/PS2 keyboards,Did not work for me. I assumed my keyboard originally came with one of these and so this one should work but I am not sure if this is true. So I deleted my old review to give benefit of the doubt.
1,parts issues...,"Had mine for about 1 year, regulator stopped working and it turned out to be a stripped screw under the regulator knob. Guess what? You can't buy a replacement nut and screw, you have to buy the whole ($92.00) regulator manifold assembly! Of course the nut and screw are ""special"" (left hand threads, square top...). I'm switching to Makita..."
5,Awesome Machine,"This is my first compressor, and I love it! Mine pressurizes up to 210. I could not find the cut in pressure anywhere, on mine it is about 170, so I was very happy with that. I was a little dissapointed with the tires as they are not as heavy duty as the rest of the unit is. The location of the valve to empy the tank is easy enough, but being on the bottom of the tank, it is kinda hard to get to, but not bad. There are holes in the frame at the bottom so I am going to replace the tires with some a little more substancial."
1,DeWalt 15 Gallon Compressor,"Nice size compressor for a home garage or home work shop. However, it only ran for a half hour and failed! It was making a terrible noise, I removed the schroud cover and found the piston was slapping around in the cylinder. The crank shaft is not sealed (open crank). This is a recipe for failure. I am amazed that DeWALT would sell such a piece of junk!I elected to take a refund rather than a replacement. I'm glad I didn't get rid of my Rigid twin tank portable."
5,Seems like a quality refurb,"The only thing that I noticed about this unit is that the yellow seems to have faded (as if the original unit was used outside frequently). The compressor itself works great. It does take some time to actually fill the tank, but once filled, it can run tools for resonable periods of time with no issues. The quick disconnect is a little bit finicky, but it may just need to get worked in. Hopefully this will stay working for a long time."
3,"It is 5.0 scfm now, not 5.4!","Kinda weird, but my compressor has 5.0 scfm written on plastic cover instead of 5.4 as on pics in this description. I wonder: why and why Amazon still advertises it as 5.4 scfm unit?"
1,Came to me damaged had to return to sender,item came off the ups truck damaged before it even hit my door - never accepted it the shipment as even the ups driver said it looked messed up - beware!!
3,Dewalt compressor,The compressor came in a carton with no protective material around it. The housing was ajar as a result. This was entirely unacceptable. I haven't turned it on yet. Hopefully it works.
2,"can't constantly run a 5"" orbital sander","I bought this because of the price and the fact that the ad says it can easily operate air sanders. Well, after 1min 45sec, the air is below 80lbs which is what is needed to operate my 5"" orbital. When I was making 2 cabinet doors out of cherry wood, I found myself waiting for pressure recovery twice as much as I was sanding. It takes 3 1/2min. to fully recover to 200lbs after I stop sanding at 70 lbs of tank pressure."
1,"Caution, this may be a second, or a refubished unit","Use caution. I just sent the second one back to Amazon. Both units were obviously damaged prior to shipment, as you could see where some other party received the same non-functional unit prior to me, and returned it in the re-taped box 3 or 4 times. I used the identical compressor of a friend, and knew this is just what I needed. Unfortunate for me that Amazon is dealing with a supplier such as this one that I had to go through. Definitely buy a Dewalt compressor, but think about an alternate source. Amazon was willing to take both units back, but having the frustration and downtime to return both units make this transaction undesirable."
1,Good unit; very bad parts avalability,"I have had this unit for about 2 years and used it only on a DIY basis with a total of maybe 30 to 40 hours. Last week started it for some air for a blowing job and at about 120psi motor statrted to cut in and out, run slowly and make a very bad noise, so shut it down. Opened the cover and there were no visable falts other than brush sparking.From the noise, sparking and reduced speed, I'm sure the motor is bad. Tried to buy a new motor and much to the surprise of the DeWalt service Center teck, there is no motor avalable. I consider not having complete parts avalability a totally unacceptable business practice on DeWalt's part. Is this an other case of the bean counters killing a product and in the end a company?"
5,Slightly newer version,"I bought one of these last night for 359 at home depot. After taking it out of the box, I saw that it was slightly different from the others that I had seen at the store. Perhaps Dewalt made some changes to the product. The differences that I noted were: 1) the cord is longer; about 5 ft. 2) the plastic shroud covers all of the pressure lines. 3) The on/off switch is different; it feels cheaper. 4) The valve on the bottom of the tank is different. On a flat surface, the relief valve now has about 1mm of clearance so it can open all the way; that's definitely an improvement. Overall, I would say that this air compressor has very good performance for its size and weight. I'm satisfied with the price and excited to see how it performs under load. I made sure to break in the motor/pump as per the manual, so hopefully this compressor will be maintenance-free for a long time."
4,Memoir by proxy,"I would call this a secondary memoir -- the author's father survived the Holocaust and recounted it to his son, who wrote this book. The son is a gifted writer and his descriptions are haunting. The father hid ""in plain sight"" through most of the war, disguised as a Polish/Lithuanian/Muslim Tatar farm worker in Germany, and very nearly joined the Lithuanian SS to complete his disguise. Fortunately liberation came before the SS, who had accepted his application, called him up for duty.I think this book would be best appreciated by educated people due to its many references to history and classical literature (of both the Western and Jewish kind). I only wish the author had gone into more detail about his father's background before the war and his life afterward. I'm not even sure how old his father was when the Nazis took over his life -- I'm guessing something like 16 or 18, but it never says."
1,This isn't what you're looking for...,"If you're looking for the French film ""La Haine"" a.k.a. ""Hate"", THIS AIN'T IT. Save yourself 89.95 and find a used copy somewhere else..."
4,hate,la haine is a great movie from the director of the crimson river but is not worth 90 dollars. try amazons uk site it will be cheaper.
5,tasty grooms cake,"These tea biscuits worked perfectly in making the groom's cake used at the royal wedding. The cake was quite tasty, but one must keep in mind that the British do not sweeten their sweets to the degree that the Americans do. Still, it was fun and easy to make, and created enthusiasm for all of us who watched the 'wedding'."
4,its ok for classical,"I am not dissatisfied with classical operetic music. But somehow making this Christmas music didn't do it for me. I was brought up on ""rudolph the red nosed reindeer, frosty the snowman -- and Bing Crosby and Burl Ives -- so Christmas is just different for me than this opera type. Hey I tried is, musically speaking it is flawless, but it is not the christmas type music I like.."
5,A great read!,"Lethal Dose is a well-written book full of clever twists and several sub-plots that all tie together nicely in the end. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and I think it stacks up favourably to many of John Grisham's thrillers. It's that good! Lethal Dose an easy book to read and one that kept me reading anxiously to find out what was going to happen next - and it kept me guessing right to the end. The characters are well developed and you do care for them and want the heroes to succeed. Jeff Buick has managed to fit action, adventure, suspense, romance, humour and even some gruesome murders into this book. If that wasn't enough, he threw in some corporate spying and a paid assasin or two just for fun. But it all works and keeps the pages turning. The pacing is great and I didn't know ""who done it"" until the very end. Buy this book! I am sure you will enjoy it."
3,"Impressive,if not totally original.","Very much in the vein of Rainbow,Deep Purple,and similar acts,this album showcases John West as an up and coming voice in rock.He follows in the footsteps of Hughes,Perry,and Turner,demonstrating an amazing range and a lot of power and soulfulness."
4,"Superb sound, imperfect track list","Milestone's Blind Lemon Jefferson-collection gathers 25 of the seminal Texas bluesman's best songs, including the eerie ""Black Snake Moan"", the macabre ""Hangman's Blues"", and the classic ""Jack O' Diamonds Blues"", and the sound is surprisingly good. (Yes, I wish it had been better, too, but the original masters are long lost, and compared to other Blind Lemon-compilations, this one is actually very impressive.)The only downside is that the song selection is not as good as it could have been...several of Lemon's best songs are missing, including ""See That My Grave Is Kept Clean"" and ""'Lectric Chair Blues"". But the sound? Really good."
4,"Bucket List ""must read"" for anyone from the Salinas Valley....","I had hoped that the book would still have the dust cover, but that was the only negative mark. I purchased it after meeting someone while wine tasting who was familiarizing herself with our area. She inspired me to read it, as I'm a native and lifelong resident of this beautiful valley and live just two miles from the river. Thanks!"
1,Book,"Don't know didn't read it, bought it for class never used it. not even once, it really pissed me off"
1,very limited vocabulary with no prounciation assistance,"We would consider it generous to award this book one star. 1) We have never before seen a dictionary which did not offer assistance with pronounciation. 2) We have been unable to locate many words in common usage. (Perhaps the most common, Chanukah.) Perhaps we were expecting another Leo Rosten. We were very disappointed."
1,I got screwed,"I ordered book Dictionary of Popular Yiddish Words and Phrases and Proverbs a thick book described as fairly new and I got an old pocket book with a stinky yellowish pages probably remembering my grandfather. The title was A Dictionary of Yiddish Slang & Idioms.So, I assume it was a typical trick some people use to stick somebody else with some crop.The seller sent me email asking for recommendation and I described to him how I feel about this transaction - never heard from him since. Typical for some."
1,Wrong,Your information on what this item fits is wrong. This set of wires does not fit my car. Another person commented on it also.
1,Does not fit Audi A4,The spark plug wire set does not fit Audi A4. The box even says that the set fits a dodge truck...
5,"Wonderful Entertainment - A Glorious Compilation, thankyou David Garrick",This is a terrific album of such variation and entertainment.A very worthy addition to one's music collectionThank you David Garrick for the memories.You can be certain this will get a regular airing over the airways of Tasmania.A great buy and excellent value!
2,An Enigma,"Sadly, this book is poorly written. I found it hard to take seriously at first simply because of silly mistakes and poor grammer. Quite often thoughts are unfinished and examples are incomplete. If you are an English teacher, avoid this book.However, the poor writing belies the seriousness and correctness of the content of this book. The concepts and ideals presented are rock solid. If you truly want to be a great leader, then plow through this book and apply the principals the author is trying to convey.Speaking strictly from a message point of view, this material is easily 5 stars. A serious rewrite would make this book a best seller."
3,Good but confusing,Ok the book was good but in my opinion by far not the best one of the series. All this entire book does is open up tons more questions as well as kill off all the main people. I have never seen the wingman series and was reading this as a stand alone series. I quite liked the series up untill this book but this book confused me. He opened up all kinds of questions in the third book then in the fourth book he ignores them and takes another approach. But in all a good book
3,Original artists;not necessarily original recordings,"While this is a great collection-most of the songs sound a little off. In small print at the bottom of box it reveals that while these are the original artists, the songs are new stereo recordings which I assume were done recently. Only a handful of the songs are the original recordings.Guess I should've known better - a 3 CD box set for less than $10 would be quite a good deal. 4 stars for content and 2 stars for the disappointing re-recordings = 3 stars"
1,Not even worth one star,"After the title of each song, the artist is listed. Well guess what? Maybe two of the songs are by the original artist. Amazon should not mislead their customers. It should clearly state that these songs are performed by others."
1,Not as Advertised,"Maybe there are some ion hair dryers out there that actually eliminate frizzy hair (of which I have an abundance), but this is not one of them. This is also a heavy and awkward hair dryer to use, and there are only two settings, neither of which works especially well for styling. If you want cold air, you have to continuously depress a button, which is another annoyance.This is my first -- and last -- Conair hair dryer, and I plan to replace it very soon."
3,Average dryer--there are probably better choices,"I've owned this dry over a year. I have fairly short, fine hair. I do not think it is quiet, and as others have stated it does seem to really blow my hair all over the place. I do use the concentrator nozzle to direct the heat somewhat, but it still is challenging to direct the flow where I want it. The cool button is a pain to have to hold down in order to get cool flow. As for the ""ion"" effect, I honestly don't know if I see it with this dryer. Thankfully, I have not had any issues with sparks, burning, etc.; yet I would not repurchase--there are better dryers out there."
4,Great Blower,This is my second Conair Ion Shine Blow Dryer. I keep one in my luggage and the other at home. It is lightweight and does a great job.
1,Not all it's cracked up to be,"I bought it to take traveling. Tried it out at home (thank goodness). It may work for long, straight hair that just needs drying, but for shorter hair that needs styling with a brush, this doesn't work at all. It blows the hair in all directions..off of the styling brush, off of curlers. Even the concentrator nozzle doesn't help..my hair wound up literally standing on end! I'm returning it and trying something else."
3,Odd but entertaining.,I enjoyed reading this book up until she thought Jack Weaver was the devil. Every chapter after that was her trying to convince that he was or wasn't the devil. The whole thing revolved around that ans not her career as much as it did in the beginning. Basically the book went from a great read to trash.
2,Too far out...,"Maybe I have a problem suspending disbelief but this book just left me wanting something more. I couldn't tell if it was supposed to be humorous, dramatic or what, and then it ended on such a weird note. I mean seriously, the devil? The story kept me entertained, until I realized that the main character seriously believed that her boyfriend was the devil... then McInnis lost me. I would try out another book of hers though, because it was well written. I just personally did not enjoy the story."
1,Devil did not Care,"I bought this book at the bookstore because it looked like a cute idea. The last line on the jacket cover reads, ""or has she fallen for the devil himself?"" I thought it was catchy, I didn't think she was FOR REAL. Come on, the TV executive was really SATAN? Give me a break. I read A LOT! And I'm sorry Sheri McInnis I know this is your first book, but this is the first book I couldn't read cover to cover. I had to FORCE myself to get to the middle, because as the other reviewer said, I wanted to see if there was some twist in the plot, but unfortunately there was not. The book was unimaginative, way too far fetched, and just plain terrible. The beginning was good, but the book itself was campy and just plain cheesy. Awful!"
2,Disappointed in Texas,"I started this book on Sat. morning and finished it at 2 AM Sun. morning. The ending left me deflated and dejected. I am the kind of reader that likes everything all tied up with a big bow. This certainly did not do that. It was a cute story and could have been better had McInnis had let Jack & Sally try to come to some better conclusion to their relationship. I think Jack would have come around with Sally's love and caring and become a better man for it and for their child. I just don't feel the characters were left deflated too. When I closed the book at 2AM, my thought was ""is this it, that's the ending? Boy that was a waste of time and money."" If McInnis writes another book, I sincerely hope that she will develop the characters better and give them chances to work out their relationships in a better way. Since there was so much ""religion"" in this book, I think the charcters should have given each other a second chance and a little forgiveness would have gone a long way."
4,Funny but disappointing ending,"I laughed out loud reading this book until the middle part. I too had hoped that her boyfriend was not the ""devil"" but from what I gethered in the ending he was. Truly disappointing ending. I would have given it a five had it not been for the ending. How could such a light read become so heavy in the end."
3,Cute read but a little discomforting,"When I picked up this book and read the jacket, I wasn't sure whether the reference to falling in love with the devil was literal or figurative. I was hoping it was metaphorically speaking, because I wasn't so ready for a satanic chick lit. I gave the book a shot and I THINK, after reading the book, it's literal. But I still am not sure!I didn't find the heroine annoying like many other reviewers, but I was distraught that this dream guy really was supposed to be the devil. I kept hoping that he wasn't and that something in the end would explain all the strange, satanic events but nothing did! So yes, the ending pretty much sucked.. but everything else was good! (but again, strange and satanic)"
5,One HECK of a good book,I thought this book was so sexy and fun. I totally got lost in the story. I'm an actress and loved the details about LA and NYC. It seems very realistic. But I don't think Jack is the devil-I think he's a great guy and they get back together.
2,Help stamp out Catholic guilt!,"The premise sounds amusing..is this handsome devil really The Devil? But far from being humorous it is really a dark piece of work. Sally is loaded with more guilt than one would find in ten confessionals. I really felt sad reading this so-called light summer reading. Poor Sally! She meets the man of her dreams and is then tormented by her happiness. We start hoping that this love affair will really work out and her misgivings are explainable. But, the ending is anticlimatic and the loose threads aren't tied up. Will someone please give Sally absoulution and let her go on with her life?"
3,Cute Book But Annoying Heroine,"Although I did enjoy this book, I found myself becoming increasingly annoyed at Sally, the heroine. First of all, she is stuck in a dead-end life until she meets Jack. Her boyfriend says he loves her but doesn't seem to want to commit; her day job is nothing to brag about; and her acting career is totally stalled. Then she meets Jack, who opens doors for her, and feels guilty about the help she is getting. Although her more successful rival for television roles and Jack's romantic rival David are taken out of the picture, neither of them are permanently injured. Then she begins to believe that he's the devil. I can't understand her or admire her at all. Jack has done nothing except show no remorse for other people's tragedies, and yet she's willing to run away from love, happiness, and success. Unbelievable! The ending isn't bad, but it seems to be something of a copout. I did enjoy it, but it's forgettable."
1,creepy,"This book wasn't badly written It started off well-paced and the first part of the story was enjoyable. But the whole ""devil"" theme gave me the creeps and the ending was just stupid. I did finish it, mostly out of disbelief that this guy was really Satan, and I kept hoping that there would be some plot twist that would save the story. But, no, it just kept getting more weird and then it ended. I threw my copy in the trash, because I couldn't give it to anybody else and it was too creepy to keep in my house."
3,A good read,It was a pretty good read. The humor was kind of dark. I wasn't really thrilled with how the author ended the book. But it was a very interesting read.
2,Good Start; Bad Finish,"McInnis can write and has some interesting things to say. I loved this book until Sally's tiresome questions about what ""was right"" and whether her boyfriend was the devil became a major bore. The storyline goes downhill then and ends with a thump. Sally is self-righteous, constantly passing judgement, yet has all the basic character flaws and then some, of a regular person. I tossed my copy. It wasn't worth passing onto someone else."
2,Words you Shoold Kno-w,"I recently purchased the Kindle version of this book. If you liked the title of this review, you'll love this book. The concept and format of the book are good but, as the previous reviewer noted, the editing is terrible. There are frequent misspellings and the pronunciation guide leaves much to be desired."
5,Buy This Book,"If you're looking for a book of tons of words to learn, buy this book. It's fun to learn these interesting new words. We took this book with us as we drove across the country. Each day we'd looked at a word and try using it in conversation throughout the rest of the day."
5,Great heavy duty sockets,"I have not used these with an impact tool, but I love them for normal hand use. They are super heavy, with nice fit and finish. I have used them with 5 foot breaker bars and have found them very durable...I have broken 1/2"" drive extension bars while using these sockets with never any damage to the sockets. I only paid 10 bucks for the set and will buy the metric set if I ever find it for the same price."
5,Wonderful,"This is utensil saving stuffer. It is dishwasher safe, and saves your fingers and everything else. Heavier plastic that isn't cheap you don't have to worry about breaking it while pushing food down the disposal."
4,skillet review,This fry pan was easy to season and I have had no problems with it. It's been nice to have that sense of childhood from owning your own cast iron fry pan. Would recommend this to anyone who wants a good cast iron fry pan.

2,Not A Fan,Positive: The fabric is soft.Negative: My main concern was getting a Duvet cover that fit our down comforter. I measured and looked and looked for a cover that would fit. This listed measurements that seemed to be right on but there is too much cover for the comforter. It drives me nuts having excess fabric. I had to pin the corners on the inside to keep the comforter in place and the buttons come out of their button holes easily. I think the whole experience has made me want to switch to a coverlet instead of a down comforter with duvet cover. It's been hard to find what I really need.
4,The good and the bad....,"My original wheel had an off center but for the tire. This made the back end bounce up and down... Not much but I figured I would buy another one and get one that is symmetrical... Wrong... Same cut. Same batch?Well, now I have a replacement... Actually, I might use it on a tail skid plane I own to give it a wheel in the back."
5,"An Amazing Treat, The playing is Magnificent!","I've owned this album for at least 20 years. First on vinyl and then on CD. It ranks as one of my top 5. Even after all these years it is still an amazing treat to hear Sonny, McCoy, Ron and Al playing together. The music is often ferocious with The Cutting Edge as a tour de force. Everyone on this recording is playing above and beyond. Everytime I put this cd on I'm amazed. Get this CD!"
2,Doesn't look like plant on computer,"I could have bought a plant in my home town for alot cheaper that looked as good as the one I received. Almost every point on the plant is gone, brown or broke. The pictures of the dwarf snake plant that you show is nothing to compare to how bad the real plant looks. I will not order again!!"
5,Linnea Cloth Doll,"I purchased this doll along with the book and DVD, Linnea in Monet's Garden to give as a birthday gift. The doll is cute and looks like the character in the book."
4,There are two cities.,There is not much I can say. The only important thing is that some people will like it and others have the opposite reaction. People should read it because it is an interesting book.
1,Buyers Hitch Adapter,"Very poor workmanship for the price. It works, but shameful looking piece of metal. Also made in India, so look for something American made instead."
5,Adding My Voice,"Teot's War & Bloodstorm have been with me since I bought them--through high school, college, and five moves. I look in the G's in the Sci-Fi section first thing, even after all these years, out of hopeful habit. Great books; I'm sad I can't replace the originals since they're held together by tape and fondness. Maybe some smart publisher will notice how much reader loyalty is here."
3,pretty good,"I am not sure what i was expecting, but it wasnt this. i think this book is more for those who actually perform ceremonies as a career, or something. i just wanted some good alternative ideas to holidays and the traditional christian way of doing things here in this country, which the book did provide. but i got lost in the details of the verbage suggested during ritual. although i will keep the book on my shelf and maybe look through it every now and then."
3,Wireless works but Regular batteries don't last long,"Regular batteries only last through about 4 albums. The only practical way to use this player is with rechargeable batteries. I am satisfied however, with the wireless aspect which works with no problems."
2,Don't waste your money,It was great while it worked. Just didn't last very long. Save your money and get something better.
2,Old and cheap,The item was not a very good item. CD players are out dated and I should have thought about that
4,What you don't find out until you open the box:,"Product works well, but takes a little more time than a regular CD player to load a CD when you first put it in. Also, when turned off in middle of a track, will not return to it's place. Note that the car adapter has the option of charging rechargable batteries if rechargables are in the CD player, but it does not have a sensor for when to stop charging, so you have to stop it manually. This machine eats batteries like a hog when transmitting, so be sure to use the car adapter.Everything else works basically as described, but watch for interference on the radio transmitter. (No big deal, just change the freq.)I got this product at a bargain price (16.98 shipped!) at amazon.com on black friday, and wouldn't necessarily recommend buying it for the list price."
2,OK Player - Bad Transmitter,"I got this to use in the car since my tape deck died. The player itself is OK. It didn't skip at all. The FM transmitter was not very good, though. There was a constant whine and the sound was distorted during volume peaks in music. I ended up returning it."
2,Coby Mp3 cd player,"a bit disappointing, as it doesn't last long with batteries.But, when it is working, very good sound."
1,Not at all what I was hoping for,"I much preferred ""Siblings Without Rivalry"" as a helpful resource for sibling bickering.This author's approach is much too hands-off, basically taking a stance of not getting involved and letting the kids battle things out on their own. I believe the job of a parent is to teach and guide interpersonal skills, not let the playground/bully mentality decide how interactions should go.The book is also interspersed with foul language that could easily have been omitted while still getting the point across."
2,The plural of anecdote is not data,"The author knows that in his family sibling rivalry is just a bid for parental attention. Once the kids are no longer rewarded with parental attention when they fight, the fighting will stop. He gives an example of a child that plays nicely in the kitchen while a parent cooks but stops coloring and picks a fight when a sibling enters.While it may be true in some cases, in our family there are other reasons for sibling rivalry. Since sibling rivalry has many causes not addressed by the author his one size fits all solution is of little use to me."
1,"I was assualuted with the ""F"" word!","I have 4 children so I am always on the look out for new and interesting ways to handle sibling bickering. The book is written in a dialouge format which is a quick and easy read. I flipped open the book randomly to read a couple of pages. I was then shocked to see the ""F"" word not once but multiple times. The dialouge was being said by the CHILDREN! This is outrageous! The author could have made the same point with out the use of foul language. This book should have a warning on the front cover of the language inside. I have quit reading this book. The author in my mind has no morals and therefore must have nothing for me to learn. He will not have my time nor my money. Save yourself the assault and do not read this book!"
2,This is an average book at best,"This book is extremely weak in its photography and style. Pictures and fashions are dated, and creativity of poses and lighting makes for bland entertainment, or instruction for that matter.It starts to show some glimmer of hope when it mentions how to pose hands and shows pictures of does and don'ts for posing them. But it stops short and doesn't offer much more (a little yes, but not much) for other parts of the body either. It never lends advice to subtle but important aspects of arrangements of posture or eye placement.The good news about this book, is Amazon will take it back!"
3,Well Built Cuff,"I bought this for use on our home gym because of articles on the Internet describing using a gym to stretch the spine by laying on the floor, and elevating and ""weighting"" the legs, as a sort of spinal decompression / traction. I found this to be difficult to do because of the positioning, and for me was not effective. So, even though these cuffs are very durable in construction with the fabric, metal ring, and construction (reasons why I selected it over some competitors), and decently priced, it does not see much use in our family's use of our gym. For it's designed purpose, it appears to be able to provide many years of use."
5,Great Ankle Cuff,I love the pair of cuffs that I bought. They are very comfortable and the velcro is extremely strong. They are not bulky at all so I can wear them throughout my whole workout. I am very happy with them
5,You really Ott to have one of these critters,"The lamp itself easy designed for some sort of industrial type of use with a tall and long reach. I use them over the bed and on both sides of the chair. I originally purchased them for my loom because they give true light and stayed well out of the way. They do not over heat like halogen. I should have bought more to the lamps when they were still being manufactured. I think they had a bad batch witch did them in but I cannot find a replacement with the same height or reach.Now it is getting hard to find these replacement bulbs. Like other fluorescents they seem to last forever but someday they will finally go south. When one does go you can tell that the replacement is brighter than the survivor. So the survivor has to be dispatched before its time to keep an even intensity from the two directions needed to see the threads on the loom.In any event these I was glad to find a replacement source.""Bring the Power of Natural Daylight Indoors"""
3,Fortune fish says shipping is outragous,I use to get these fish out of the gumball machines when I was younger. They are fun to play with.I don't understand why they are charging $4.98 shipping for something that could be mailed for the cost of a stamp. If you can't make a profit off of what you sell maybe you should sell something else.
5,Great!,"I painted a 50 year old vinyl bicycle seat and it turned out GREAT! Now, I have yet to ride on it, as the bike is still in pieces so not 100% sure what the durability is yet, but the stuff seems to be ""bonding with the original surface"" as claimed.One point, I'm a novice and had to really REALLY stretch the seat cover onto the seat pan using whatever tools were within reach (wrench etc) and where I was doing that the paint did come off. I plan to clean it up and recoat that portion. I feel that is more my mistake than the product."
5,Probiotics as dietary supplement,"Recently I bought a package of Ultimate Probiotic 4-Billion tabs, which so far has helped recovering my intestinal flora to its healthy condition. It can be seen the effect, but not only due to this, as there are less reactions to food that previously caused a kind of digestive disorder or manifested on my skin. I also take care of diet that supports good intestinal health."
1,Where is Ruben?,I thought this was suppose to be Ruben's remix not Kayne West. That a waste of Money..
5,"Review for ""What If"" by Ruben Studdard","I bought this single on a 12"" LP and listened to the Kanye West Remix first. I'm not a particular fan of Kanye West but I absolutely love Ruben Studdard. The Kanye West Remix is excellent; FAR superior to the original version, which appeared on his smash album ""Soulful"". Whoever thinks that the remix is all Kanye West needs to have their head examined. Ruben sang practically the whole song. Kanye only rapped a little. The remix is VERY good."
1,RAP RAP RUBEN!,"This single is horrid! Unbelievable, what happened to that voice? Terrible, I do not recommend to anyone!"
1,RUBEN WHO? THIS IS ALL KANYE WEST!,"Hello is this single remix supposed to reflect Ruben? I don't think so, it;s all kanye west. Huge dissapointment, I do not recommend this remix because the one on the cd was ok. Not good but better then this remix."
1,what happened?,"what happened to the smooth, powerful voice of the velvet teddy bear? These songs don't beign to showcase his talent. I hope he goes back to the kind of old songs that he did before - forget the rap!"
1,HELP! HELP! HELP! He's Sinking,"this boy is sinking as fast as hes gaining weight. Since one does an idol need help to sell a cd or even a song. This is pathetic with kanye west. What happened ruben? Your concerts aren't selling, your cd has sunk to all time lows and now this single remixed with Kanye West. Pathetic and this single sucks."
1,WASTE OF TIME,"A total waste of time. The song ""What If"" was a mistake in the first place but to add Kanye West to it, just made it worse. Ruben Studdard is not the teddy bear and maybe he should go back to ricky and play house together. Totally unprofessional and Kanye, man your way to cool for this crap."
2,Sorry Ruben,But this is even worse than the orginal version and it sounded just like Sorry2004. You have betrayed your fans by going rap. We loved hearing you sing real songs on AI. Now you have added a rapper and it's not even your song anymore. You can barely be heard! You really need to get better material.
5,Seller was top-notch,Originally ordered the wrong bulb from this seller. They were extremely helpful with finding the right bulb for my desk lamp and immediately shipped a new bulb out to me. Would definitely recommend buying from them.
4,Its a light bulb.,the light bulb fits and works. It does the job it is meant to do. Ain't it great yea ya.
5,Ott-lite truecolor,"unfortunate you can only find this bulb online now, guess the newer ott-lites were made to use the regular bulbs without the pins."
5,Very informative book,"Ms. Howe is an extremely strong woman. Her courage to step out of the Catholic church and to discover truth should be a great example to all. I have heard Ms. Howe speak and I believe that not only is her message the truth, but also it is presented very well. I learned a lot from her book and I am thankful for her ministry."
5,Adorable!!,These doggy sunglasses are hard to review in writing... they are the cutest things for dogs and dog lovers :) thank you for such a fun product!
2,"another one grinds the dust, hey, hey, hey.....","Very easy set up. Not out of round, like some of the grinding stones reviewed here. A good feature is the stepped down arbor inserts. Will fit from 1/2"" and up. Yes this is a repeat, but what is there to say about grinding stones, eh ?Update: 12/6/12....Now that I've had time to use this stone for a while, I feel obliged to update this review. This is the softest stone I've ever used. It literally leaves a grove in the wheel when you grind anything thats not flat. It also spits dust out everywhere. Therefore I delisted from a 5, to a 2 star review. I think you would be better off at Sears."
2,Dissapointing - this book will not make you a better fighter,"The single most usefull concept is to start all your kicks the same way not to telegraph your moves. Beyond that, it all just pictures that display Wallace incredible ability to raise his knee and do lots of kicks without ever lowering it again. (You can also get those from old Black Belt Magazines).The text refers to Wallace in third person and most likely was writen by someone else. It also repets itself all over the book."
4,Kicking Guide,This book is not very complicated. It is well illustrated. Wallace was an amazing kicker that won even though all his kicks came from the same side. His explanations will help refine anyone's sparring tactics. I have used several of the things that I learned to great effect. You should consider his other book as well.
5,Great info on stretching and kicking,"Bill ""Superfoot"" Wallace is a legend in the martial arts community. His book is informative and detailed. Tough stuff to conquer but worth the effort."
4,Perfect if you have the ipod mini !,"Charges the iPod mini and little static interruption. The case is great for protecting your iPod...I dropped it on the ground once and no damage to the iPod. The sound was low in my husband's car, but fine in my car; I turned up the volume in my car and it was fine."
2,Awsome book!!!,Its a great book with a big twist in it. But 4 some strange reason I cant get the sample in the store I only borrowed the book and its the best book ive ever read.
1,A self proclaimed dance cd...that you can't dance to,"I thought this was supposed to be a dance cd...guess not. The first 6 tracks have goofy sudden stops that drag on and kill the beat, no chance of dancing to them...sad really, they mixed it up well, but just chose really poor songs."
4,"Great Information, If You Can Work At It Full Time","This book is very complete, and almost a definitive reference to the 'state of the art' at the time it was written. For anyone aspiring to work full time in this field, it's a five-star work. Of course, information changes rapidly in this field, and some of the content is already dated, and there have been important developments since its publication.Where I think it falls short is in failing to deliver a good ""fast food"" solution for those who don't have 40 hours a week dedicated to search engine positioning. All of the information is in here, but there's no clear sense of what the top priority actions should be, for a typical small website.As search engine experts go, you can't do much better than the author and his team at iProspect.com. If you've got the time to work through a dense 500+ pages, and apply the knowledge, this is a great book for you."
4,a step up from their last 2,"not that they were bad albums, but CO1 and americana never really stuck with me. they were just a little too poppy. this is one of their best cds, with the only problem being the length. there is a wide variety of sounds on this, from rock to punk to ska, but its all good. the best songs are neocon, the worst hangover ever, and my favorite, spare me the details."
3,Good but not close to their best,Good but not great. Maybe it will grow on me the more I listen to it. It does not quite have the catchy tunes of past releases.I don't find myself wanting to listen to it over and over.
1,Don't Bother,"At some point in their career, The Offspring decided there was not as much money to be made in edgy, raw rock agression (re: their earlier work) as there was in pop-lite. It wasn't that big of a deal anyway, because those listening to their superior work in the early 90s, were now all too busy punching keys in their cubicles to be questioning The Offspring's complete and inexplicable artistic u-turn."
2,THIS IS NOT GOOD OFFSPRING,"It isn't and I do not understand how the same band that released such cds as Smash or Ignition could release this. It has official sellouts written all over it. When they realesed Americana I went into denial that they could possibly sellout but this is the wakup call. They have strayed too far from their roots and just care about being played on MTV and in Teen Movies now. If you want to find out what the Offpring sounded like when they were good buy Smash, you wont be dissapointed."
3,an arc,"of stupidity. they start out stupid, they gain some sort of godly gift (smash, americana) and than they go out where they began. They're is some good tracks on here the noose, hit that, worst hangover ever and spare me the details, the rest are samey and boring. maybe next time."
2,downward spiral for 3 albums now,"i can honestly say i am a big fan of the offspring. i'll always buy their new albums and hell support them when people say they suck. at americana i saw a downfall of who they were. sure americana had its few moments (have you ever and the kid's aren't alright) it also had its share of bad ones. conspiracy of one came out, the first 4 tracks were great, i had renewed faith in the band, then came the rest of the cd. living in chaos was a lame Limp Bizkit wannabe song. now Splinter. Ok, the noose is a GREAT song, the rest...... well you be the judge. Sorry guy's maybe ron welty was right and got out of there in enough time."
5,great album kicks ass,"The Offspring with this album did it again for good! i love it I think ""Hit That"" is not a strong single of though it could have been another like ""Da Hui"" even though most all the song would be banned or with beeps but great album by them"
4,Doesn't Dissapoint,"The seventh disc from the California group is both the hard-hitting punk and goofy hijinks we've all come to expect. Spliter opens with ""Neocon,"" a mintue-long track that can't really be a song, but carries a message. By track two, it's the same old Offspring we all love. ""The Noose"" is one of the better tracks. Track four, ""Hit That,"" was the album's first single. It deals with mature, real-life problems in the Offspring's very immature style. Decent, but not as good as former singles.The really great tracks on this CD are ""The Worst Hangover Ever,"" ""Spare me the Details,"" and ""The Noose."" The rest of the album is decent but not outstanding. ""Da Hui"" seemed stupid until I found out what the song is about. The album ends with the humorous ""When You're in Prison,"" a olden-days sounding song, advising inmates ""don't pick up the soap/ it's bad for you.""If you are new to the band, go buy Smash before buying this one. However, all veteran fans of the band should buy for sure."
4,Good Album,"This offspring album is short, but good. It isn't blow you out of the water great, but its a nice album. The first single, hit that, is an okay song, not really there best work though. The best song on the cd is spare me the details. It's solid all the way through and also has a little bit of comedy to it. My two other personal favorites were The worst hangover ever and when your in prison. When your in prison has an orchestra playing, which is unusual for rock. It is also pretty funny. The worst hangover ever is an awesome song. This album isn't a waste of money, which other people seem to think. Buy it."
4,Not as catchy as Smash,"I bought this on day one of release in Australia on December 1 and was a tad disappointed by the shortness of the album, and that no tracks leapt out at me like their earlier stuff, especially on ""Smash"" and ""Ixnay on the Hombre"". However, after repeated listens it has grown on me, but I still can't put it right up there yet.The Australian version comes with a bonus DVD,which as a video of ""Da Hui"", the making of the ""Da Hui"" video, plus an interview with Dexter and Noodles about the making of the album. That is not bad and worth a look for Offspring freaks."
2,whatever.....,"I just want to say that the guy below me has no idea what he is talking about. The Offspring's best CD by far is Smash. Their self-titled cd is also an excellent cd. other than that, their other cds have a lot of holes in them. This cd is by far their worst. There are too many goofy songs. They don't play punk music anymore like they used to. Just listen to smash, then listen to this cd....you'll see what I mean."
3,Could Have Been Better!!,"I'm not saying this CD is bad, but its not that good. It's nothing like the old offspring, this cd has a couple hits, but all the other songs sound old and not that good. If you want a perfect cd, get offsprings ""smash"" or ""Americana"", this Cd is allright though, i would't buy it but get it as a presnt or something!!"
4,3 1/2-4 Stars for the best punk band ever!,"ok i was a bit disapointed in the cd. its unlike all of their other ones. yeah they still have their offspringish taste in MOST of the songs but not in all. Also what got me mad was the inside covers, usually offspring is really creative in making th most confusing picture cartoons but these wern't as cool. im still a great offspring fan i just dont like this cd as much but its still is goodNeocon-9The Noose-9.5Long Way Home-8.5Hit That-7Race Against Myself-7-8.5Cant Get My Head Around You-10The Worst Hangover Ever-7-8.5Never Gonna Find Me-9.5Lightning Rod-8.5Spare me The Details-8.5Da Hui-9.5When You're In Prison-6 (what was the point of this song that was dumb)Offspring had a great rep until this cd id buy it but i warn u its not their best"
1,Clean versions suck,"What's the point of a clean version of a CD. It's just stupid. Your kids aren't gonna have nightmares of hearing some ""bad"" words. It's so blown out of proportion this cencorship thing. Wake up, your an idiot if you buy this instead of the origional."
2,Dissapointing,"I want to start this by saying that I have liked Tbe Offspring since I first heard their self titled album when I was younger. I really thought that waiting 3 years for a new album would have been worth it. I was wrong. While the cd is far from abysmal, it feels rushed. Not only that, but the song ""Da Hui"" is just a repetitive and awful use of the f-word and ""When Your In Prison"" isn't even a real Offspring song. There are some good tracks in here, such as ""long way home"" and ""race against myself"". However, for an album that clocks in at a little under a half hour it's a big letdown for a band that, while never exceptional, has always at least made entertaining music."
2,where did the Opffspring go wrong?,"This has to be the weakest album that the Offspring have ever made. Somwhere between ""Ixnay on the Hombre"" and ""Americana"", the Offspring went from creating deliciously intense punk rock to mediocre pop music. The tracks on this album range from decent (""Can't get my head around you"", ""never gonna find me"") to downright abysmal (""Worst Hangover ever"", ""When You're in Prison""). Also, being only 29 minutes long, this album is rediculously short. Mabye that's a blessing considering that the quality of the songs on this album will make you want to press the eject button on your CD player after the first five minutes anyway."
3,Not a step forward.,"I love the Offspring. I have all their records. I will buy all of their future releases the day they come out. I promise.""Splinter"" will provide a song or two for my semi-annual mix CD, but nothing more. Their choruses used to be more catchy than herpes. Now, not so much.The single ""Hit That"" sounds great on the car radio, and I have high hopes for ""Spare Me The Details"". But there are many great fragments of potential classics that fail to solidify.The Offspring have always had a penchant for novelty songs, and here there are two...the one about a hangover and the one about prison. They're fine, and as always, good for a chuckle, but you can't keep playing them over and over.I never tire of ""Come Out and Play"", or ""Denial, Revisited"", or ""Don't Pick It Up""...but beside those tunes mentioned above, nothing sticks this time.The band sounds great though. They make terrific noise. And they sound like they're having fun...it's just that I'm a big fan and I wanted more."
4,"Its the offspring, of course its good!!",Again the offspring came out this year and schooled the new pop punksters like good charrolet and simpel plan. Its a shame more peapol are buying simpel plan records than this. Anyways a must have for any offspring fan or someone who wants to here pop-punk done right(also check out the ramones).
3,"Not their best, yet not as bad as they say...","While it's obviously no ""Conspiracy of One"" or ""Ixnay on the Hombre"", it's a solid release. And for the first time in a while, an album that doesn't sound kind of similar to past albums. My personal favorite track on this CD happens to be ""The Noose,"" seeing as how I pretty much enjoy their more fast paced numbers. ""When You're In Prison"" seems to be getting a lot of flak from reviewers in general, but I think they missed the point... track 12 was meant to be a JOKE!!!! Lighgten up. Anyway, to sum it up, I don't have to tell Offspring fans to buy it, chances are, they bought it already. But for the more casual fan, it's worth a listen. Just don't expect the next ""Ixnay..."""
3,offspring nearing the end of there career,"having bought all the offspring cd's, i have to say this one wasn't bad but didn't bring anything new.my first complaint is that it's way to damn short, but then again it is the offspring and most of there albums are short. i also have to complain that some of these songs sound alot like there older songs, and the lyrics of most of these songs carry plots that have been used in alot of other songs (there's and other musicians)....which of course means i felt that ""da hui"" could've used some better lyricsthey did a good job with the worst hangover ever, and it is a very fun cdbut i'm afraid that this cd is where the offsprings career starts to go downhill, it's a shame"
5,The Offspring does it again! GREAT CD,The offspring has come out with many good cds. This one is an exception. ITS A GREAT CD. Americana was the first good CD and then Conspirisy of One was just AWESOME. Now this? WOW! 3 Great CDs in a row. Hard to find amung todays popular bands. GO OFFSPRING AND BUY THIS CD TODAY!
5,"Wow, ok","Ive made a review before, but I had to make another oen cuz they negative reviews are rediculus, anyone that likes Offspring will like this CD, its just as good as any of their other ones, its actually more on the top. All the songs are good, go ahead and find out! Its a great CD!!anyone who gives this 1 or 2 stars either 1. has not even heard the CD, or 2. dislikes the offspring or their genre!"
3,A Little Dissappointing...,"But still fun. I enjoyed this album enough to maybe listen to it again in the future. The Offspring took a new approach with this album. It really reminded me of THE HIPPOS (whose new album is also AMAZING), but they were missing something. Can't quite put my finger on it, but I am listening to THE HIPPOS new album right now and I like that one a little better. But still... It's solid. GO Get it!"
3,All their albums are good,"All Offsprings albums are good. But lets face it people, I don't think history will be too generous to this band. They are average at best. Their huge album was their album from 1994. They always put out good songs, but I just don't know. Some bands you just don't take seriously and that is a band like Offspring. Their album from 1997 was also very good and the one after it too. I have all their albums except the very first one I think."
2,Shame!!,"I've been a fan of The Offspring for about ten years, and without a doubt this has got to be their worst LP yet. All the songs are nothing but a rehash from past albums. I played this CD to my wife and then played Orignial Prankster and Americana. She thought they all were one and the same, and so do I. It's a true shame The Offspring has turned into such punk boy-band (read: bread-and-butter beats, pop). This one is going to the hall of shame.Don't bother."
2,They've lost it.,"There's no nice way to say it, this album is a disapointment. You could kind of tell this band was going downhill after Americana which was their last awesome album. Conspiracy Of One was good but didn't have the overall quality of Americana or Smash.Anyway Ron Welty's departure is painfully obvious and there's some stupid pointless tracks on this album like ""When You're in Prison"" which should have been a joke hidden track but isn't.The whole album feels like they didn't give %100 and just kind of slopped it together.There's still a few good tracks like ""Hit That"" and ""Can't Get My Head Around You"" Those have the feel of old school Offspring tracks, but overall I think this band is slowly losing it as much as I hate to admit it."
2,"A ""Hangover""","Splinter is a medicore album just as offspring is changing to a medicore band. There are some nice tracks on it e.g ""the worst hangover ever"" but is this the same band who realeased ""smash"" or ""americana""? when i first herad the new tracks on the cd i couldnt believe what im hearing. pop-lyrics and songs that reminded me on the soundtrack of ""monkey island"". dont misunderstand me. the album is not that bad, but theres a world between the first two albums and the last two one. and i liked the other world much better. sorry dexter"
3,Worst CD of The Offspring,"Neocon 4/5- Good introThe Noose 5/5- Very fast, great chorus, one of the bests of the CDThe Long Way Home 4/5- Good song, good final partHit That 6/5- Very catchy, good keyboards, incredible chorusRace Aganist Myself 2/5- Booooring, i hate the chorus(Cant't Get my) Head Around You 5/5- Good inro, good riffsThe Worst Hangover Ever 1/5- Wow, terrible ska-song, i hate this songNever Gonna Find Me 5/5- Fast, good chorus, the final part is greatLighting Rod 6/5- Excellent song, amazing chorus, the part ""throw me down"" reminds me ""no way out"" from Get it Right from IgnitionSpare me the Details 4/5- Good piano, great balladDa Hui 3/5- Very fast, not a great songwhen You're in Prison 0/5- Jaja, this is an horrible song, boring, terible, very stupid"
4,The Wait Paid Off,"Personally I have never been in love with The Offsprings albums since ""Ixnay on the Hombre"". When Americana hit, it made it seem like The Offspring had completely sold out from their punk roots (SEE: Smash, Ignition, or Ixnay on the Hombre, then listen to Americana and Conspiracy of one and compare them.) But, Splinter seemed to be almost a leap into the past for them, with hard punk driven tracks like ""Never Gonna Find Me"", and a few softer but still good tracks like ""Spare Me The Details"", they have come out with what I think is a better album then what precedes it. I am still waiting for The Offspring to come out with another amazing album like ""Smash"", but the chances are slim. If you liked this album you would probably like ""Conspiracy Of One"", or ""Americana"", but my suggestions to you is you listen to their earlier albums like ""Smash"", or ""Ixnay On The Hombre""."
