5,Remarkable,"I recently discovered this wonderful band, and have yet to find a bad CD by them. One may quibble over how much synth is too much, but at the heart of all this is some astoundingly beautiful music. I find it suits hot, sunny days as much as dour, rainy ones. Great music is great music no matter where or when it's played."
5,Getting started in Fly tying,"I have never tied flies before and just started fly fishing a year ago. This book provides detailed instructions and illustrations on how to tie a variety of flies. Even if you have never done this before. The book covers materials, various patterns, knots, and more. The illustrations are large, colorful, and easy to understand. A very good book for a beginner."
2,"Been there, done that","While the Freestylers rocked hard with their debut album in 1999, the same old samples and grooves just doesn't cut it two years later. It seems as the guys didn't notice the scene went on and the still chewing on the tried and buyed oldschool hiphop-breakz. Half the Pressure Point album could have been well written in 1999, you won't tell the difference. There are some promising tracks like Now Is The Time, Calling or Blowin Ya Brainz kicking a hole in the woofer, but in overall the new stuff fails on too much subjects, mostly the ever recurring samples from the album We Rock Hard. The Freestylers ran out of money for new effects and sample CDs. Too bad."
3,Finally Sinbad on DVD,"I do not like B-movies but this one is great. I only started waching this do to how hot sinbad was an he was such a man you know what I mean any way like what every one else said bad acting and under use of props still enjoyable to watch. I, like so many others have waited forever for them to release this dvd lets hope they do not make us wait to long for the other seasons. I personally like the other seasons better due to sinbad was more hot with longer hair and the shodow beard and he was less boyish."
5,Loved the show! Pop adventure,"Absolutely loved the show, can't wait to get my copy - found it Much cheaper at Amazon.ca (Canada). The 2010 release was only done in Canada, so if you are crossing the border, pick it up. Otherwise, go to Amazon.ca. You pay the international shipping, but it is still cheaper."
1,"Still can't get it to work! ""Royal"" has horrible customer service!","I bought this from another store, and I still can't get it to work! I have a PC with Windows XP. The software that comes with the unit is not very user friendly, and the customer service is atrocious (or non-existent!). I would definitely buy from a different company. I'm looking at the ICON units right now."
5,I Can't Live Without This Kind Of Hip-Hop!,"Eminem,Dr.Dre,Snoop Dog-nothing personel but THIS ishow it's done.I like LL's stuff in general but ""Radio"" standsalone as the early,primal Def Jam-era example of tough,minimalisthip-hop.But a big change is that LL Cool J adds song structureto the raps with ""Dear Yvette"" including backup vocals,evergloriously off key as they are.his debut 12"" incher ""I Need A Beat"" is also here as are ""You Can't Dance"",""Dangerous"" and""You'll Rock""-all beat heavy street jams worthy of Run DMCbeat box Bronx rap circa mid 1980's.The catchy ""I Want You"" isn'tlisted on the back oof the CD but it's a definate highlites.LL'sclever boasts like ""I've got more rhymes then Edgar Allen Poe""and his declaration of ""I Can't live without my radio!"" makethis a heavy,boasting album worthy of this rapper's savvy."
2,It was okay. I think more technique was needed.,"I think there is a need for ""YOUNGER"" dancers. The dramatization of the roles is way over acted. There needs to be more concintration on the technical part and less on the ""ACTING"". This will enable to be rise to the level of the other classical ballet companies."
1,Not worth the postage,A poor group of ideas for improving your sailboat that most owners could readily think of and improve for themselves.Returned ! The book title overates the content.
4,pretty good,This product is a pretty good buy. It's definitely worth the 30 bucks and it's very user friendly. The only small problem with it is some of the minor things like playlist and things aren't as user friendly but aside from that it's been doing a great job and I'm definitely enjoying it!
3,Strictly for DJs,"Item received in brand new condition. No complaints about condition of item, but I am not a DJ nor am I trying to be. I'm still learning how to use system in order to mix soundfiles. Directions in manual not useful at all, you must learn through trial and error process or through others who are experienced in using program."
1,Misleading image/photo,"The image attached to the ad is not what is being sold. The item for sale has less ""staying power"" even when fully charged - only 600mAh, less than 750mAh. Your image of the item is misleading."
2,Not up to par,"I have read several of Gifford's books and this is the first one that I didn't enjoy. I am being kind by giving 2 stars. The plot was completely unbelievable. Gifford's other books Wind Chill, Assassini, Praetorian, have some feeling of historical context. Not one of the characters is this book was convincing. Marines in uniform at a political convention! Come on. In the forward the author talks about doing research at the White House. Ok, he may have accurately described the oval office. I really was looking forward to reading this book because of the others that I have read and was disappointed. I had just enough interest in it to finish it. Don't waste your time if you were going to read it based on his previous work.Gifford needs to stick with Nazis not Washington Pseudo-Thrillers"
3,Dancing thru Washington politics,"While the author dances his way and guides the reader through the maze of national politics, he does have a bit of trouble with the music...or at least recognizing the musician. The musician, Mr. Gifford, is Johnny Mercer ... not Jimmy. People in Savannah are proud of their 'native son'. Rightly so. The book itself is a good companion to have on a lazy wet day. It's one to spend a few hours with while curled up in a favorite chair or under a shady elm in the late afternoon. A word of warning though. Do not take this book to bed with you. You may have trouble putting it down and getting some sleep. Your boss won't appreciate you napping at your desk the next day. If you must read this at bedtime, make sure you don't have to get up early the next morning. You might not make it."
4,A Satisfying Selection,"This CD contains most of Ravel's best-loved orchestral pieces, and Ozawa's penchant for orchestral flair is a good match. I especially enjoy his handling of Rapsodie espagnole, a work that necessitates wild bursts of sound, not too carefully measured (the same with Alborada del Gracioso); but his softer, more intimate interpretation of Valses nobles et sentimentales, while contrasting, is no less adept.This isn't my favorite rendition of La Valse, but it's still terrific. It's great to have so many of Ravel's most important orchestral works on a single, excellent recording. I recommend it quite highly."
4,Beautiful & instructive...,"I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Middle Age period, the grim realities of war at that time, etc... This book is also perfect if you're looking for realistic documentation, for example before a role playing game or a play."
3,A bit disappointing,"I found this season to be less entertaining than the previous 3. The performances are great it is the story lines that disappointed me. I realize too that back in the day during its original run. this was when I began to loose interest in the show, but that is purely personal."
1,Mediocrity and hypocrisy,"I approached this book as a (former) Matthiessen fan and came away disappointed by the mediocre prose. This was basic, boring descriptive travelogue, repetitious at times, with absolutely no noteworthy or novel insights. But the final telling failure of this book was an element of momentous liberal hypocrisy. Matthiessen chastises the Bush administration for its stance on global warming and places the blame for the impending global destruction at the feet of W, but chooses to ignore his own contributions. Pray tell, how does he justify the carbon emmissions he contributed to the atmosphere to drag his sorry carcass from the Northern hemisphere to Antarctica not just once, but twice? What would he think if the first carbon-reduction agreement was to ban all recreational travel to Antarctica as has been proposed by the Obama administration? (And don't tell me he planted a tree somewhere as a carbon-offset balm for the guilty consciences of the jet-setting liberal elite)"
2,Appalling!,"I recently returned from South Georgia/Antarctica and immediatly ordered Peter Matthiessen's book. In his very first sentence is an error so great (Punta Arenas,located in Argentina) that I suddenly found myself searching for further errors. YES--I found them and I'm only on page 31!! Still--I will finish the book and probably find some enjoyment from it, if only that I want deeper conversation about a wilderness I came to love."
3,"Beautiful descriptions, but not much else","This rambling memoir details two trips that the author made to Antarctica with Victor Emmanuel Nature Tours, which specializes in birding trips. Peter Matthiessen beautifully describes several scenes from the Antarctic, which made me long to visit this stark landscape filled with life.However, the book has no real direction. It reads like a journal, albeit a well-written one with a greater-than-average literacy quotient. The author makes little attempt to introduce any of his fellow-travelers or to show a personal journey of the mind to mirror the Antarctic voyages. Eventually, it just stops, rather than ends. He digresses from accounts of his voyage to describe the adventures of early polar explorers, or to comment on issues such as global warming and whaling. Although these asides are interesting and well-reasoned, there are better sources for each topic.Birders and armchair travelers may enjoy the descriptions of his wildlife encounters, however."
2,Mediocre Book About a Miraculous Place,"Peter Matthiessen is most honestly characterized as a ""writer's writer"" in that his works most favorably impress literary critics more than they garner mass reader appeal. This effort is a mediocre travel memoir of two different voyages to Antarctica and for each trip the author fills the pages with interesting historical, geographical and natural facts. Unfortunatly this book has no ""heart and soul"". ""End of the Earth"" merely 'reports' two stories on Antarctica as if Peter Matthiessen could take it or leave it. The usual book jacket accolades recite ""...he blends a vision of harsh beauty, a traveler's love of adventure, and a profound appreciation for the splendors and extraordinary wildlife of a forbidding yet fragile world of ice"". If only that were true this could have been a great book."
5,This Was Great!,"This book was a great book! It's good for just reading and also for facts. I'm using it for a trem paper I have to do on the origins of conflict in Northern Ireland. It helped me alot. You can find out aboutThe Holocaust and World War 2, ""The Troubles""in Noprthern Ireland, and The Isreli/Palestinian Confict. It was a great book. Allie"
2,Not about hate,"The first two sections of this book, concerning World War II's Holocaust and the ""troubles"" in Northern Ireland convey the feelings of youngsters surrounded by hate and violence.The third covers the Arab conflict with Israel.These vignettes all cover experiences from a single point of view, and are filled with emotion, but almost no fact.I can't say this is a good introduction to young readers of the experience of war. It's an opportunity gone to waste."
4,Review of Sunbeam 3966 Classic Iron,This is a very nice iron which I purchased within the past few months from an Amazon.com seller. The soleplate is non-stick like many irons. The only thing I don't like is the somewhat rough texture of the soleplate which was very smooth on my previous iron. I like the stainless steel body of this Sunbeam Classic iron and its performance is very good. A small plastic 'pitcher' comes with the iron to make it easy to put water into the iron for steam. I use only filtered water (reverse osmosis) in the iron since hard water deposits can damage an iron. Distilled water is also perfect for use in a steam iron. This iron was much more reasonable in cost than my previous mostly plastic iron (different brand name) which I dropped several times and finally had to throw away. A heavier iron such as this Sunbeam does not tend to fall off the ironing board if handled correctly.
2,doesn't keep proper time,"I ordered both the clear rhinestone and the multicolored. The multicolored works purfectly and looks great I get compliments nearly every time I wear it. However, the clear one does not keep accurate time, the hands are subject to just jump ahead. I kept both of them since the return cost and hassle would have not been worth it to me personally. I do love the one that works properly."
3,"Ok, but I can't use anymore.","I like the range of supplemental vitamins and minerals and herbs in this. However, I have been diagnosed with soy allergy! Can't use this anymore! That is a bummer. It has a good blend of ingredients, except for the soy. Plus, after doing research online, it seems we may all want to consider staying away from soy. If it was not for the soy I would ocntinue to take these. But, I have had to toss my bottle."
5,Powerful Resource for Deliverance,"With its very thorough breakdown of the Gates, this book is a must-read for all who have longed for blessing and freedom. I was greatly impressed by Nancy's fluent knowledge of the subject. I believe that this book will be a powerful tool for the beginner, the advanced, and every level in-between. It will serve as a trusted resource in guiding the hands through the often confusing battlefield of spiritual warfare and deliverance. As the Presiding Prelate of Voice of Joy Ministries, International, I have made Weapons of Mass Deliverance required reading for all of the covenant churches and ministries within our Network. To all pastors, ministry leaders, and believers in general, please make this book a necessary addition to your library.Rev. Bishop Allen B. Coleman, Presiding PrelateVOICE OF JOY MINISTRIES, INTERNATIONALINTERNATIONAL FELLOWSHIP OF COVENANT CHURCHES & MINISTRIES"
5,Great keys for deliverance!!!,"The Lord has given Nancy keys to the gates, gates that can be holding us back in our walk with Him. She shows us what enemy is at what gate and how to pray against that enemy for complete deliverance and victory. There are many wonderful nuggets of wisdom and I enjoyed Nancy's tranparency as she gave her personal testimonies of things that she has dealt with and the victories she has received at the gates. I especially like the prayers she has written at the back of the book. They are very anointed and powerful. These prayers are a great way to be praying for breakthrough for yourself and others. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to defeat the enemy in their life and walk in victory."
3,Farewell,"While the knock on this CD is that it was put together solely to fulfill contractual obligations and so contains uninspired writing and playing, there is still much to enjoy, if one can look beyond expectations.Wayne Shorter may be missing from most of the CD, but when he shows up, it is worth the wait. His short, intense solo on ""Jungle Stuff Pt 1"" is, as always, brilliant. The fact that you wish it were longer is testament to this fact. The tune itself is catchy, falling generally into the ""World Music"" category of WR tunes.The other highlight is Carlos Santana. Guitar was never a key part of WR (Ralph Towner notwithstanding), but here Santana generates a lot of heat on the title track and contributes a great solo on ""Man with Copper Fingers."" The sound IS different than prior WR, but is that necessarily bad?Try listening without the WR expectations and see....there is a LOT of music out there that is far, far worse than this."
4,no no no,"Wayne and Zawinul both wanted to end WR because they wanted to do solo work and WR took up lots of their time. Especially Zawinul, who usually had the most work putting together the material. This was a mutual finish to a beautiful legacy, and there are one or two outstanding cuts on this album. You may make it your last WR album, but don't pass it over."
3,"Weather Report's ""Swan Song"" ;(,,,,,,","""Jungle Stuff, Part #1"" is the BEST song on this last of the Weather Report recordings. I LOVE the almost hypnotic, rhythmic tempo. It's so sad that this pioneer fusion/jazz group ""checked out"" like this. My overall favorite Weather Report effort is ""Heavy Weather"" (EVERY cut on that disc is ""superb""!!!). My favorite ""WR"" ballad is the hauntingly beautiful, ""A Remark you Made""... a STUNNING performance! Again, it's too bad that a group with so much talent went out the way they did with this recording."
2,Contractual obligation only,"Weather Report broke up after ""Sportin' Life"" was released, but they owed Columbia one more album. Wayne Shorter had other commitments and could barely participate. So Joe Zawinul went through his Rolodex and called up friends (Carlos Santana) and old band members (Peter Erskine) to help out. Needless to say there isn't much of real interest here; lots of Zawinul synth, and that's about it."
1,Don't waste your time.,"I am surprised that this rewrite of ""Who Moved My Cheese""was ever published. Stick with the original and save yourmoney.As this book is a thinly disguised rewrite of Spencer Johnson'snow classic text, it should be no surprise that this book isnot worth keeping. If you doubt my review, on the day that Iwrote this, there were 13 used copies available.The favorable review from Wisconsin must havebeen from the Publisher."
3,A Minor Book by a Major Writer,"I've long enjoyed THE STORY OF ROLF AND THE VIKING BOW by Allen French. My first reading of that book was at the age of twelve, and I remembered it fondly. Re-reading it was a pleasure, even with the somewhat stilted language. THE RED KEEP was another pleasure, while somewhat less. This book, I'm afraid to say, is not French's best work, which still makes it better than most. The story moved too slowly for me, though it had a fine, brooding quality, and the characterization was excellent. A fine tale of intrigue and justice set in twelfth century England. I do hope that some of French's other work, including SIR MARROCK find their way back into print. Recommended to boys of all ages."
2,The Lost Baron isn't really worth reading...,"A big reason I didn't like this book very much was because it didn't get good till the last 1 or 2 chapters. (Well, that's my opinion.) The rest of the book was just bland."
2,this game won't work on all PC's,I bought 2 copies of this game. It installed and runs fine on my brother's Dell desktop running Windows Vista. It installed and runs fine on my Toshiba laptop running Windows XP. It will not install or run on my HP Pavilion desktop running Windows XP. Previous versions of this game and other Hoyle games installed and work fine but not this one.I would not recommend purchasing this product if you have an HP computer and don't have a laptop or desktop of another brand to play it on.
2,Buggy and Difficult Install - But Fun,"First, the install is counter-intuitive. When you run the install CD you have to figure out to click the ""Hoyle"" Banner running across the screen instead of ""Install"". Also had issues with this thing eating CPU cycles and overheating a P4 Dell. I suspect a memory leak. The support is pretty weak too. But the game looks nice while it is running. Turns you computer into a lovely space heater."
2,Beware,"Does not work well with Vista. ""Clunky"". If you are running Vista, make sure game(s)you buy/use are compatable. Another lesson learned"
2,needs more info,the only disappointing thing with this product are the game selections. what is included is just ok. there was no way to tell what games were on this cd.
3,False Advertisement,"Plays very well, but was suppose to come in a Jewel case. It did not. This seller should not advertise it is coming in a jewel case when it does not. Thanks!!"
1,Waste of money,The item lacked full description on amazon's website. From the way it was described I thought it might have had all the Hoyle card games I wanted. When I rec'd the disk I found that it didn't.The price $8.69 (the website showed the price as $8.49)for the disk + $4.98 shipping. I returned it to amazon who only refunded $3.91 after deducting the return shipping fee of $4.98.I feel totally ripped off by amazon regarding this purchase and will likely not buy anything other than books from them in the future.
2,inaccurate information,This is not for Windows ME as is listed in the description. Not what I was looking for. I want to play a card game and am not interested in characters comments.
1,Year released may be a problem,I love it BUT AMAZON IS NOT SPECIFYING what year the release is. Microsoft has stopped any use of the 2004 version which I bought last year. Any attempt to play brings a warning that images are not registered with Microsoft. I specifcallybought replacements of the 2004 disc because I read many opinions on line that the bridge was better than in later versions. I believe there was a sale of the company and that seems to have led to a failure to keep older versions' registrycurrent. Know you may be buying unusable product.
4,Basic but OK,It has all of the games you expect and is fun to play. No tutorials and it occasionally stalls on my netbook using XP. All in it is fun and worth the money
3,No Jewel Case,I would have gave this 5 stars but since they said that it came a in a JEWEL CASE NOT SO came in a card broad box with the Hoyle Sleeve. I think you will love the game it's self many hours of fun.
4,card game,"Nice software, fun to play with, but what's not very practicle is that you have to load the CD in it before playing everytime you want to play.Some games have the tutorial options some don't, and reading the card game rules is not very pleasant."
4,this toy rox!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,my friend has this yo yo and i cant put it down! he got it at toys r us for fifteen dollars and i saw here that this is the best price. my friend got a rip off. but this is the best yo yo i have ever delt with and i think it would be a good thing to buy. at school yo yo is the new rage and this one is the best one that anyone has. SO BUY IT NOW OR IT WILL TEMPT YOU FOREVER!
5,Great Book For My Office Waiting Room,"I love this little book. I keep it in my office waiting room. It is small and the bright cover attracts attention.I was drawn to this book originally by the Peter Max art.I love the short quotes from people like Bob Hope to Jimmy Carter on the question ""what is spirit?"" The answers range from silly to serious.It is a great waiting room book because when your client is called they wont be in the middle of a long magazine article when you call them in. ( I have a small day spa).Other books I keep in my waiting room that clients seem to enjoy is ""Living Juicy"" (cant recall author) and "" You can heal your life"" by Louise Hay.These books are colorful and you can pick them up and be inspired by just reading one simple quote or page.I also recommend them for the person with ADD that cant sit down and read for long periods of time or a nice gift book for someone who can use a little inspiration. The bright colors are uplifting and joyful to look at.Great little book."
1,do not order from 6ave.,"this is an old posting for 6ave, they will not ship you this subwoofer. i received the kfc-w3012 which is worse than the 3011. just go and change who you are buying this from under the ""new"" at ""$that price"", waste of my time from 6ave waiting for a sub to come in and it was not even the right one."
3,A great book for UGLY people like me,"I thought this was a pretty good book for ugly people like me. Surely the author's experiences expressed in the book related to their and my lives. Having the name Tim, I feel a real bond with the author Tim Mathew. I believe the authors Mr. Dunn and Mr. Mathews would be delightful people to meet in real life. Hopefully we could get togethr some time and have brunch at the local bistro."
1,...which ever ...,After reading the book I learned how ... Mr. Mathew is. I heard many things about Mr. Mathew from his students and this totally makes a fool out of him. Wow he really was a ... one in college! THe book made me laugh at him because I have seen him and he really is ...!
5,Awesome Comp.,"These 2 CD's really show what Southern California punk is really all about. The San Diego CD is one of the best compilations I have ever heard, with awesome tracks from Against The Wall, Pivit, Lucky 7, and surprisingly, Dogwood. The CD is a great travel partner. Due to the massive variety included in this set of CD's, one could never get bored because the music never sounds the same twice in a row. The Orange County CD is more of a ska CD, with some better than average tracks. However, the majority of the CD sounds like a typical New York gutter band. For the price, go for it. The San Diego CD will keep you in amazement as the ballads rip through your head. Trust me. It is a great buy."
3,as expected,These are white undershirts with pockets. They covered my body without causing me any serious injury or shame. Mission accompllished.
3,Satisfied Customer,This multi-family push button switch replaces an identical switch that was only 4 years old. The top button broke and I had to replace the unit. Normal usage of this type switch should last much longer.
2,Good for medical professionals but not for students,"I am an RT instructor and I chose this book as a text book for my arterial blood gas analysis class. the students found it very difficult to understand and some of the formulas have been abreviated to the point that a novice will have trouble understanding them. This is a very good review for anyone who already has a general understanding of acid base, blood gas and electrolyte interpretation and can clear up some misconceptions, however, this book is not adequate for someone just learning the basics. My students were very unhappy and I wound up not using the text nearly as much as I had planned."
2,Not a fan of this book,"I wasn't a fan, I read a previous book and loved it but Marjorie came across as a selfish child who married a man in the excitement of the moment and when he was called away before the honeymoon could happen, got cold feet. The storyline just wasn't attractive to me."
5,Fantastic!,"I cannot say enough about this book, especially for parents who have adopted from China. I bought this book for my daughter Rachel, sight unseen, because I knew that Ying Ying Fry was from the same city in China as my daughter Rachel. It is an understatement to say that I was shocked and surprised to learn that not only are they both from the same orphanage, but my daughter's picture actually appears in the book! (the pics for the book were taken one month before we travelled to adopt our daughter). It's great to have a book to share with Rachel about her city, about her first year of life, that is written by a child for children! If you have any connection to the Chinese adoption process, you must have this book!"
5,Exceded my expectations,"I cannot imagine better performance from such inexpensive speakers. I listen to a wide variety of music such as rock, hip hop, and classical and all sound great.Please note that these have a protective layer on them so that you do not get interference that you get from most all other computer speakers! this is a huge feature. sounds quality and sleek look can't be beat."
5,great sound!,"I love these speakers. After enjoying them in my small computer room, I purchased these as a gift for my daughter and son-in-law who watch DVD's on their computer screen. Now, they'll not only actually hear them but hear them with speakers that give clarity and depth (with minimal investment of money!)I tried to order black speakers, but white ones arrived. Good thing the sound isn't impacted!"
4,JBL Creature,"I had received it several weeks ago, At first it didn't kick in but when it did.....WOW. An excellent system for the money and GREAT looking"
2,"Big name, little sound","I've always been a fan of JBL speakers, but this Creature thing is a huge disappointment. In short, the speaker system only provides highs and lows. There is no midrange sound to speak of. I had to close my eyes and fiddle with the treble and bass controls for a good 5 mins before I could justify not returning it (too much trouble). To be honest, I get better sound out of my Altec Lansing portable speaker set than I do out of the JBL Creature.Big disappointment."
4,sound and price,"I bought a Jbl creature II 3-piece powered speaker system ,the sound is good,and the price is good too.then I recommend my two friend,they bought too.they feel great joy at the sound and the price."
3,a bit of hype,"still tinny after all this time! wanted to like them, desperately! but, you get what you pay for and these are all about design, not sound."
4,JBL Creature II's a Good Value,"This Creature II was a replacement for the factory provided speakers for our Dell, which had failed and were not under warranty any longer. The JBL purchase turned out to be a very pleasant surprise overall. The quality of sound is definitely a step up from the previous set.Only one detraction is the AC power ""brick"" is surprisingly bulky and becomes almost too hot to touch after being attached to power."
2,So-So Speakers,"I'm not too happy that I made this purchase for the sound quality is fair at best, and the volume is lacking. I would return the speakers, but the packaging is too difficult to put back in the box, so I will likely be giving the speakers away."
5,Speaker System,I am very please with my purchase. It came in a timely fashion and was easy to hook up to my Mac. I also like the power the little speakers have I can go into my office crank the music and finally get some work done!
5,Great Sound for a Great Price,"I had these speakers for a few years and paid full price at the time. When I saw that Amazon was selling them for so much less I decided to pick up a spare set just in case I blew out the first. I have had the first set for 4 years now. I noticed that a few people had trouble hooking up the speakers. It has been mentioned already but I want to repeat it - the plugs have a specific configuration to plug in fully and as long as you do that the speakers work just fine. Setting it up is a breeze. The sound is much better than what I get from the built ins in the iMac. That is why I bought these speakers in the first place. I do get some distortion when played very loud and especially with lots of base. I have gotten used to the ""creature"" appearance. The speakers are small and have a good cord length if you need to place them some distance from the computer. All in all I would rate this speaker system as a best buy."
4,Great For the Money!,"Not Much to Review....JBL At this price? If you want midrange look for something else$ If you have a Mac, the Creature 11 goes great with. A lot of cords come with System!! After getting this I'm happy with the price...but I would spend more money on my next system!! Hope this helps..."
3,Disappointed with the sound Quality,"These speakers look really nice and are very well made. I am an audio enthusiast and bought these based on reviews. They get very good ratings on a number of sites. They sound very ""hollow"" to me though. There is no mid-range to speak of. I wish they sounded better because they have little LED lights on the satellites which is very cool."
3,Good small speakers -- for as long as they last.,"I just bought my second set of Creature speakers because the price was roughly 50% of the price of my first set. The sound is great for a low cost laptop setup. The downside is the first set lasted about three years and then what?? The landfill?? The left speaker stopped working and the problem turned out to be inside the main creature. You can buy new small creatures but you can't replace the main creature. In other words, like much that is produced today, these speakers are produced to last a few years and then be chucked. They're too inexpensive to send them back for an expensive repair and JBL doesn't design them to be reparable by having the most likely parts available to order. I have a tinkerer friend who wants to give it a go but when are companies going to learn that the way they produce products has an adverse effect on the environment."
5,small pieces with sensibility,They fit into small space. And very good sound even for classic music....express any sensitive note. I am very happy to purchase this.
1,"All treble and bass, no midrange!","I work with a live sound system installer that has used professional JBL concert speakers for 20+ years. So I was astounded to hear what passed as acceptable for their ""consumer"" line. Simply put, the subwoofer puts out deep bass, while the two little speakers put out a mid-treble range... but nothing in between! I thought, ""WTF happened to my music?"" It's almost as if they just forgot to add a woofer to the mid-range satellite speakers. The music sounds weak and distorted. (These were uncompressed Apple Lossless tracks, btw.) Try something else, please."
3,Lasted... a while,"I bought these in 2006. They looked very cool. However, they only lasted a few years. The volume they were able to produce became less and less until they were unusable, and I had to add them to my 'electronic junk- to recycle' pile. Also, even when they did work, they drew like 20W of standby power even when they were off, which is incredibly wasteful. Long on style, short on substance. I would have expected better from JBL."
4,Studio Apt. speakers,"I'm in a place that's only 18' x 23"" and they're perfect for it. I can't believe how much they'll fill up the room. If this was a much larger room, they wouldn't work as well. Actually, the sub-woofer could power an even larger room. I have to be careful I'm not disturbing the neighbors!"
1,Poor mid range sound,I bought these speakers based on the excellent reviews that it received from other uses. I cannot understand why it is rated so high. There is practically no mid range sound in the speakers. The subwoofer and the two speakers handled the low and high frequency sounds but the voice in songs is not present at all. On a normal rock song the singer was heard faint from a distance while in music predominated by vocals I cannot hear much except squeaks. No amount of tweaking with the bass and treble knobs or the equalizer in my computer could fix the problem. I am returning the product for a refund.
4,"Great for the average listener, not so for audiophiles","Cool! Beautiful! Strange! These are three words that could easily describe JBL's Creature II speaker system. I bought these to increase the sound of my laptop, and so far they're pretty great. They are sleek and almost alien-esque in shape, and sound great; I do agree with some reviewers who claim they sound hollow, as certain DVDs of mine do sound as such. However, there are many pros about the JBL Creature IIs, including but not limited to the touch-sensitive volume control buttons, which adds to its appeal. Recommended for the average listener, but not for the genuine audiophile."
5,Excellent Sound For the Price,"We use these speakers with our iPod, and did a lot of comparison shopping actually listening to various setups before choosing these - virtually all others were more expensive - including the Bose iPod speakers - and frankly none produced a better sound. In fact, these speakers give a full, rich sound way above their price. Obviously, as a desktop system they are not intended to blow your sox off, but they have caused more than one friend to scratch their head and ask, ""Where is all that sound coming from."" We love them. And they look cool, too."
1,what a rip off!,"Had these speakers for less than 6 mos. when the speakers stopped working. I could hear a little coming out of the sub-woofer but nothing else. I called JBL and they said send them back. it has been a month and I have not seen a replacement yet. Harmon/ JBL's customer service sucks and when you call them they will repeat the mantra that it will be another 2 weeks. obviously Harmon knows they have problems with these and they are just passifying the customer when they call in.I do not recommend buying these or any other Harmon product. if you need computer speakers, take a look at Altec Lansing."
3,JBL Creature II 3-Piece Powered Speaker System,just a very nice looking accessory for your withe mac book.the sound is not what i was expecting
5,Great sound at a great price,"I have a portable XM radio for work and needed a pair a speakers and found these JBLs and the price was incredible, I ordered them and the set up easy and the sound was JBL all the way deep bass and rich treble. I you need speakers for an Ipod or laptop or XM I give these a thumbs up on quality, sound and great price.JBL Creature II 3-Piece Powered Speaker System"
5,Just amazing speakers,"I bought this speakers for my iMac. I have a white iMac, so it just match perfectly. Sound quality is pretty good!!!"
2,Looks = great; Price = cheap; Sound = you can do better,"For about $40 you can get decent sounding speakers, but these don't have sound you can find in comparably priced speakers. I think you can do better than these... You would expect something with a subwoofer to be able to really kick out sound. These don't.If you're more picky about the looks, AND if you intend to use these for your personal use when you sit 3 feet away, and if you're not trying to fill a room with sound, then you won't be disappointed with these.But if you're picky about sound, skip these and go with something from Altec Lansing... or spend more money and get some Harmon Kardon SoundSticks. I have the HK Sound Sticks (about $100 more) and have never been disappointed."
4,Great sound!,"This system is great except for one thing... there is no head phone jack :(, but other than that it pushes great bass."
5,Loveeeeeeeee It!,"These speakers are worth double every penny paid for em'!!I love the sound, Its crisp, clear and balanced - without the constant rotating the frequency wheel! - the only slight problem I have is with hard rock // metal music - the SCREECH!!!!! - but thats because these speakers are power packed and I turned the volume too high ;-)Oh and the LOOK! .. the LOOK! ... The LOOK!!!!!!Every guest I have had, ask.. Hey what is that, A Camera? A Security system? ..etc...etc.. and how great and eloquent it looks on top of the Dell UltraSharp :PAliens have abducted me.Now only the Creature III can save me."
5,Amazing!!!,"These are fantastic speakers. I use them with my iBook and iPod to play music in my dorm room. One of my main interests was size and style-- I wanted speakers that wouldn't take up my whole desk and that would look good with my beautiful white Apple products. These fit the bill. The subwoofer sits on the floor beside my desk, and the two satellites are on either side of my laptop on my desk. The system sounds great!I was trying to decide between these and the Harman Kardon Soundsticks, but chose these because they're so much smaller, and cost less. My next door neighbor has the Soundsticks, and I honestly don't notice that much of a difference in the sound between the two.Once you get your equalizer levels right, you'd never know that all that sound is coming from such small speakers. The subwoofer sounds tight, there's plenty of midrange, and the highs are crisp and clear. Plus, they look SO COOL!I really can't believe that I got speakers this great for such a low price!!"
3,Poor sound quality,"Look good. Sound poor. I'm far from an audiophile, but it's obvious to anyone that these speakers were made with design in mind, with sound as more of an after-thought. Tinny and hollow, music is unenjoyable to listen to on this system. Spend the extra money on a worthwhile system unless you plan on using these only for gaming and possibly movies, if you don't mind the tenuous sound you'll get."
4,"WOW, good lil' speakers!! Good sound","These are really good mediocre speakers, but they won't ""blow"" you away. They are good computer speakers for a one room sound system, but isn't good for a whole house solution. BUT great sounding speakers for a 1 or 2 room sound system, and awesome for computers!! SOOOO much better than your typical computer speakers. The two speakers are really little and take up very little space. The subwoofer is pretty big and takes up alot of room wherever you put it. I gave it four stars because the treble and bass knobs are kinda flimsy and are wobbly. AND also if you try to blast it, you get either a real tinny sound or too much bass..it just may take some playing to get it just right......but I have to say, these are the best computer speakers I have gotten, and I have had quite a few high dolllar computer speakers...I paid a fraction of the cost for these compared to others, and these compete really well...awesome!!"
4,JBL Speakers Review,"For relatively inexpensive speakers, these produce a high quality sound with ample bass from the sub-woofer. I would recommend these to anyone who wants to spend less than $73 including S&H."
3,Nice sound from small speakers.,The JBL Creature II pc speakers have a better than average sound for a 2.1 system. The controls are easy to use with separate bass and treble controls on sub and volume control on of the small speakers. They are loud enough for an average room.
2,Cute but quiet,"Cute product.... fast delivery... arrived in excellent shape. I was, however, somewhat disappointed with the product overall. ""Loudest"" volume is still too soft to be heard mere feet from the computer. The on/off button is on the BACK of the subwoofer... not too convenient. Would not buy it again."
2,Aesthetically pleasing to the eye but not the ear,"Classic case of 'looks good, sounds horrible'. And I don't mean they sound marginal. The sound IS that bad. Which is is disappointing because there are very few PC/MAC speaker setups that have white cables (cabling) rather than black if you're concerned about that sort of thing."
4,nice speakers,"the speakers are really nice, esp. the bass.i ordered them by standard shipping yesterday, and I got them this morning, which was really surprising.the speakers are small enough not to take much space on desk and the sound quality is still nicesetting it up was very easy, page 1 of the instruction is all you need. or simply just plug in the wires with matching colors."
5,On time and Perfect!!!!,The item arrived on time without any harm and was all that i had asked for and more!
1,Poor Quality,"I got these speakers for my iPod and thought they would work great. They look cool but mine broke two days later. I returned them and got my money back. Also, the sound is bad."
3,Bass is too overwhelming,"The sound clarity is very high (I have to admit), BUT its either too much or not enough bass, you see there are two knobs on the sub-woofer one for treble (which is fine) and the other for bass and that is were the problem is, when its on the middle the bass is to much, and if you turn it down a bit you lose most of the bass. So it's very hard to balance.I would suggest a two speaker set (with out a sub-woofer)"
2,Big sound but then............,"My problem is that the ""touch"" sensitive volume controls on the little speakers gets stuck, either too loud or no sound at all.Oh yeah, you can't do anything to FIX the problem. So, Get a good deal, and then not be able to use them. Ever ask yourself WHY the price deal??? Now you know why!"
2,"great look, sound not so hot","I just can't deal with the sound quality. Plenty of bass, plenty of treble, but there's just not enough midrange. Turning the bass up doesn't help. It doesn't sound full, and it gives me a headache.On the bright side, this is a very cool looking speaker system. The volume buttons are cool, but I would prefer a knob that I can turn up and down quickly rather than pressing buttons repeatedly. The speakers are nice and small, which is why I bought it, since I have weird constraints on the size of the speakers that can fit on my desk, and all the other systems I looked at have speakers that are too tall. But I'll have to keep looking, since there's no point in buying speakers that don't sound acceptable."
5,My Review,"I liked these speakers. You have to have a little bit of room, well just more than a ""little bit"". They're pretty small, but put out a lot of power. You can really ""fill"" a room with the sound that it puts out. One thing I really liked was the long cords, they aren't hard to stach somewhere, but you can make your own little sound surround station."
1,It stopped working after the first week!,"I am now trying to find something to replace it with, since it was the last in stock with WholesaleAV and the product is discontinued. The worst part is that it was a Christmas present..."
1,jbls - i should have known.,"do not buy these speakers. amazon clearly knows there's a problem. i received the first set, nothing out of the left speaker, like a lot of other reviews mentioned. after returning those, a second set was shipped to me.. same problem. the thing is, you can't just swap the speakers and use, say, two right speakers because the volume control is on the right satellite and also the connectors are different. triangular connector on the left, square on the right. amazon's customer service is in the process of refunding my money at which point i will do what i should have done in the first place, pay more and get something decent. there's a reason these speakers are $40."
2,Not really good. Sound breaks up easily,"These speakers are small and look cool, but they do not do the job whether hooked to a computer or an iPod directly. They cannot handle any amount of volume. They are too tinny and the bass is too flat. The combination of the speakers really does not work. I boutght them for my house or office to simply listen to music while doing work and they were not good for even that. Go with Altec Lansing. That is a much better product."
4,Not a bad product for the money,"This is a good product considering the price. Sound is decent and it's a good sound system for a laptop in a classroom. As a teacher, this sound system provides what is required for the price. Not wonderful, but not bad either. I'm happy with its performance."
5,Great Price and Worth the Money,I don't know a whole lot about computer speakers but these are everything I could need. Good sound at a great price.
4,A little tinny but great for 40$,"These speakers cost me 40$ and they sound great for speakers that cost me 40$. If you are an audiophile looking for the perfect sound, keep looking, but these speakers are fantastic for the value. Highly recommended."
4,Good sound for the price,"I purchased these speakers December 2007 to give to my son for Christmas, to go with his new iPod. We have other JBL speakers, which are incredible, so that's why I decided to go with these. My son and I just set up his speakers yesterday, and they do sound quite good (this is in a somewhat small bedroom. He thinks they are very ""cool"" looking, and the touch volume controls, and funky but handy bass and treble controls add to the ""cool"" factor. I do have one complaint, though, and that is that the on/off button is on the back, so I find that inconvenient to get to. We had to angle the big thing (can't think of the name!) so that it would be easier to reach the button. He doesn't mind, and they're his, so he's happy. All in all, a great product for $41!"
2,DISTORTION!!!,"At first I thought this was a good product but when I turned it up a LITTLE, the bass distorted. The treble was fine, though. So, if you want bass that doesn't distort, this is not the product for you."
1,Gimmicky and stupid,"The only thing these speakers have going for them is their unusual appearance. The touch-sensitive volume control is needlessly complex (why would anyone consider it better than, say, a KNOB?), and offer no indication of how loud the volume is. The volume control stopped working entirely five minutes after I started using the speakers.The bass was fine, but the sound was tinny and crackly no matter what I set the treble to. And the sound quality is downright awful from a distance... not only can these not fill a room with sound, but they don't sound right unless you're sitting right in front of your computer."
1,don't know ?,I don't know ? see I paid for the system on was ripped off when all I got in the mail was a stinking power cord !
1,"beautiful, but acoustically flawed","my friends proudly showed me these speakers that they are able to plug right into their Ipod. the futuristic design is wonderful. trouble is, they sound terrible. my old $58 boom box has a far fuller sound then these. these kinda sound like my childhood AM transistor radio - tinny, no mid-range. if you want decent sounding speakers and not just pretty things, keep looking..."
2,NOT WIRELESS,"FOR SOME REASON I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEDESCRIPTION SAID THESE WERE WIRELESS SPEAKERS. I HAVETO RETURN THEM, BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF THE QUALITYOF THE SOUND IS GOOD OR NOT."
3,Don't buy this version,"Virus is a good movie and I would rate it a 4 for those who like the ""end of the world"" Sci Fi type movies that have hope. Unfortunately this version is in EP and is such a poor copy that I cannot recommend it. There may be other sources for better copies. I wish the product description had said it was EP, that would have pointed me in the right direction. As a result the 4 for movie, and 1 for quality of this type make it a 3 at best."
4,little horror,"i saw this when i was little and my whole family fell asleep. people are on this boat and they get attacked by this virus, that is some computer thing. i dunt remember what happned, but what is this movie rated??"
4,An Exceptional Album,"I've always had a large amount of respect for the music of Til Tuesday. I've had this album a few years, and I think it is their best. The first album and the third album are also good, but this release was their shining moment. These are some very well-written and intelligently crafted songs. You can tell that a lot of work was put into them. Aimee Mann is a good singer. ""What About Love"" is an amazing song, and the synth playing is really good. ""David Denies"" is also one of best on here too. If you're not sure which release to get, this is the best one in my opinion. Very good album."
3,A good album.,"I think that Welcome Home is a satisfying release from 'Til Tuesday. All of the songs are pretty good. I think this second album is just as listenable as the first one. Welcome Home has a fuller sound to it, though. I also find Welcome Home to be a bit mellower than Voices Carry. This disc also has a nice production. The musicianship is very tight and talented. Aimee Mann does a nice job with the vocal and bass guitar duties. There are some really nice choruses throughout. My favorite songs are ""What About Love,"" ""David Denies,"" and ""Have Mercy."" ""What About Love"" is a really good song. The keyboard playing really grabbed me when I first heard it a few years ago. The album's songwriting is good. Welcome Home is worth a listen."
4,Could not find this anywhere but with Amazon.,"Loved this when it came out originally. Lost it but will be able to get my hands on it again thanks to Amazon. Great 80s classic. ""Coming up Close"" and ""On Sunday"" are just exceptional melancholy pieces that haunt you long after the listen."
4,above average prog,"This was actually recorded in 1992, I have no idea whats happened to these guys since then. This CD is an enjoyable listen for those who like prog with alot of keys ala ELP or Cairo. There are almost too many changes in some of the songs, as if they were trying to cram everything onto one album. Organ changes to synth changes to fuzz guitar to chorused guitar etc... all interspersed with chants, whale noises and just about anything else you can think of. The end result, while being fun, can be annoying as just when you think you've caught a groove it changes direction. The playing is all top notch, the vocals are good (4 members sing) and the production is good. I would rate this as an above average first release and would really have liked to what these guys could have done as a followup."
5,Love These Books!,"Wow, a book starring a woman mechanic; I love it! Having Mohawk blood, I also enjoyed it that the heroine is an American Indian. Very fun reading this series!"
5,Patricia Briggs does it again!,"Great story! The first book I read by Ms. Briggs was Masques - years ago, and it's still one of my favorites. I love how she brings ""otherwordly"" beings into the modern world with Moon Called. I liked it so much I ordered the next two in the series on Two Day Shipping. Definately a great read. I can't wait to read the next ones."
5,Excellent,"Excellent. I'm excited to have a few authors that are intriguing, I've just added a new one."
5,I hope this is the beginning of a series...a long series!,"Plenty of action, just enough romance, and believable magic makes this a five star read. Mercy's tough without being bullet proof, independent without being absurd, and sexy without being ridiculous. Don't get me wrong, I love well written sex scenes and have a deep appreciation for fantasy erotica, but I truly respect an author who doesn't have to lean the narrative on them like a crutch. If this is your first Brigg's novel, don't let it be your last. They are all good reads."
5,So Good You Can't Put it Down!,"I had to force myself to put the book down and go to bed. This one will keep you up for sure.Actually, the book reminds me a lot of Kelley Armstrong's ""Bitten"" but I think ""Moon Called"" is better. Mercy is a great character. She's easy to relate to and very likable. The males in the book are strong without being obnoxious. Briggs manages to avoid a lot of pitfalls other authors who write about supernatural characters fall into; such as overly aggressive males and bitchy females.I also like that Briggs brings into the book common issues such as ""coming out of the closet,"" using the term to refer to sexuality as well as a character's fae nature. It brings a kind of realism to a subject that would otherwise be unbelievable in an everyday context.Oh how I hope this is the beginning of a long series!"
3,"Well written, but ultimately boring","I had to struggle through this book (literally kept falling asleep when I tried to read it at night), even though it was very well written. It was just boring, I didn't really connect with any of the characters, save perhaps Samuel and only because I actually started with the Alpha & Omega series before starting this one. I don't really have anything bad to say, quite frankly because it was pretty unremarkable, and nothing jumped one way or the other. I'm giving it three stars because, it wasn't terrible (like an Anita Blake novel, ugh!), it actually was well written, because I like the Alpha & Omega world enough to give this one a chance ad because I'm willing to write this off as a first book flub, where sometimes authors are actually getting to know their characters as much as readers are."
5,Don't judge a coyote by its cover,At first I thought this book was going to be silly but once I started reading I couldn't stop. Which on its own right is a miracle because I don't usually like reading because if it doesn't interest me within the first few pages I am not gonna read it. This book made me buy more of her work and its all good in a week I read 4 books :) it's so good I would highly reccomend it.
5,A really great story,"I really enjoyed this book. Patricia Briggs has done something very difficult. She has successfully created a new paranormal world with werewolves, vampires, witches, and now ""skinwalkers"". I was engrossed in the story, and read it in two days. I will definitely be looking for a continuation of Mercedes story."
3,"Slow Starting, But Still Good","I liked this one. I felt it was very slow starting, though it did pick up a bit a few chapters in. I enjoyed this, but initially, I wasn't sure I'd be continuing with the series. I decided to take a chance though, and read the next one. After reading them both, I've decided I like this series a lot more than I initially thought. This one is not a four star book for me, but it's interesting, and different from most other paranormals I've read, which is why I decided to continue with the series. I have no problem recommending this to other paranormal fans."
4,Good Start for Series,"This book definitely ended better than it began. It started off a little slow, but when I finished it, I couldn't wait to pick up the next book in the series, Blood Bound. I recently started reading this genre, and I had never read any stories featuring fae or any other magical creatures-I just never had the interest in this genre before because it all seemed too unbelievable to me. But Briggs has a way of making even the unbelievable, believable. If you like paranormal/urban fantasy books, this is the series for you."
3,"good plot, but mediocre writing","The idea/ plot for this is rather interesting. However, the writing/editing left something to be desired. Often the scenes were confusing, with random phrases or words that made no sense in context. The characters were somewhat well developed, but the backstory was vague and undefined, and confusing at best. The 'romance' portion was ridiculous and out of nowhere, clearly thrown in haphazardly, almost as an afterthought.This book would be much improved by decent editing."
5,Loved this book,"I'm not going to write a summary for the book since there are already several reviews that include a summary. I will say however, that a book store employee recommended this book to me; i was sceptical at first, but the book soon won me over. I'll be buying whatever book comes out for this series. It deserves the five stars i gave it and more."
4,Quite good,Let me start off by saying I was not so sure about this book and I rarely buy a book that had more than 3-4 in the series as I get really tired of the drama and repetition. I really enjoyed this book and will be buying book 2.
5,Quick and Intriguing read,"Mercy Thompson isn't a werewolf, but she was raised by them. She is a sort of shapeshifter and turns into a coyote which gives her a good sense of smell and hearing. She works as a mechanic, but gets involved in werewolf business when a newly changed wolf shows up at her shop.This story moves very quickly and Mercy is a captivating character that keeps you reading through the night. All of the characters are interesting and unique. There's a lot of macho guys in the novel, but Mercy holds her own against them. Another thing I appreciated was that Mercy didn't immediately sleep with all the guys she was attracted to like in many paranormal novels. When the romance comes it feels real rather than blind lust."
4,Interesting characters,"I stumbled upon this book after reading a few of the Kitty books (which I couldn't get in to). The main character, Mercy, is really well-developed and likable, as are most of the book's chraracters, and the story is interesting and moves well. I won't go into detail about the story b/c plenty of other reviewers have, but with this genre I sometimes find the action moves along artificially, which authors can get away with because the world is a made-up one. But in Moon Called, the characters' actions and relationships with eachother seemed natural and relatable, even though they're werewolves, vampires, fae, etc... It added a lot to the overall story & kept me caring about what happened."
4,A wonderful start,"This book was quite an enjoyable read. I read it in one sitting. The heroine is quite likable and provocative, and it was a startling pleasure to enjoy her forays into various relationships and political dealings. I highly recommend this novel and am quite eager for the next installment."
4,Very enjoyable story,"I really enjoyed this story. It has a very strong female character who knows who she is and who isn't perfect. She is a walker who can turn into a coyote and she seems to be the only one around. The world of vampires, werewolves, fae and walkers is very interesting as well. This is a complete book in of itself, but if it's not the first of a series, I'm going to be very disappointed because I want to know a lot more about that world. Actually, Patricia Briggs was an unfamilar author for me. I thought that this was part of a well developed series and was surprised that it wasn't.This is not a romance, it's a fantasy mystery. I state that because some of the other reviews discuss the romantic elements and vamp/were/fae romances are very popular right now.I want to read another book about the coyote girl raised by the wolves..."
3,"not the best, but not the worst","I had looked forward to getting this book for a while and when I ot it I was slightly dissapointed. Mercy in the book is a mechainic, and she able to change her form into a coyote. She lives next door to an alpha male werewolf. This is a romance book minus the romance. It does have a good story, and the plot is good, but if you are seeking smut and romance this is not the book."
5,Everything that LKH's books should be... but aren't.,"Great mystery. Plenty of red herrings and twists to keep on interested. A great feel for werewolf, vampire, and fae politics - without being preachy.The heroine is very likeable. Tough without being a ""Mary Sue"". Smart without feeling a need to make the men around her feel stupid. Funny without being camp.All in all, a very good read. None of the so called ""erotica"" that Laurell K. Hamilton insists on brow beating us with, but lots of romantic interests and possible future romance.I particularly like that this heroine is a self confident business owner, who accepts what she is. She recognizes her limitations of size and strength (against both men and wolves), and accepts that it's okay to leave the fight to others every once in a while.I will definitely be reading this author again."
3,"Great heroine, total gabfest","Patricia Briggs has talent - a lot of it. Her character Mercy is tough, smart, and capable - but savvy enough to know her own limitations. She's a skinwalker - a coyote - and inhabits a dangerous world of weres, vamps, ""faes"", witches and other supernaturals, managing to navigate them all without getting herself killed.Mercy is great. This book however, is a case of a superior character inhabiting a so-so story, way too talky and plodding. In the last 100 pages I found myself foundering on every other page keeping all the characters straight, and having to do so because very little happened a lot of the time except endless discussion of were politics. The dialogue is good, don't get me wrong - but the action was pretty lacking and just had too many characters of lesser importance to track. I want better for Mercy in the next installment - more balance of action and dialogue that's worthy of a great new heroine."
5,Better than what LKH used to be like,"I read Moon Called by Patricia Briggs a few weeks ago, and loved it! Ihad never heard of the author, and I'm glad I found her. Moon Calledis everything Laurel K. Hamilton USED to be like before she startedwriting group-therapy-through-porn fiction. Story takes place inmodern time, lots of fae politics, shapeshifters, vampires etc... allin fresh new mythologies with a blend of European and Native Americanlegends.Mercy Thompson is the main heroine. She's an auto mechanic withmagical abilities thrown into the intrigue of the fae. She's toughwithout being annoying, sexy without having to shove it in the reader'sface.The only down side is that so far this is a stand-alone book. I like agood series to get lost in. Moon Called ends in a satisfying way, butis left open to a series. I hope Briggs is furiously typing now."
4,Thank you....,"to all the people who wrote positive reviews about this book prompting me to buy it. I'm not an avid reader of this genre, but as someone who once loved the Anita Blake series this series is just what the doctor ordered. I can now find relief for what was ailing my aching heart.I love the world and the characters Patricia Briggs created. Mercy is great. I gave this book 4 stars because I thought at one point the author got a little wordy and I was getting confused about Mercy's reasoning about the kidnap. But I've already read Blood Bound and that is going to be a 5 start review. I can't wait for book 3!"
4,A Fun Read,"From the first page this book caught my interest, a great hook that seemed to effortlessly make me want to keep on reading. The characters were well written, though perhaps not as deep as I usually prefer. Yet the exciting tale and very well done description of werewolves proved more then enough to make up for the simplistic characters. More often then not the supernatural beings are given to much of an otherworldly feel, making them to hard to believe in. Briggs gives werewolves, fae, and vampires such an earthly feel that it wonderfully easy to see them as truly real people. This is the most important aspect of this story, at least for me. Her well formed ideas of supernatural beings politics and lifestyles give us the reader strong tools to just be, and believe within her world. It was a fun read and I am ordering the rest in this series now!"
3,More of a 3.5 star book!,"For the most part I really enjoyed this book. I liked the characters and their development throughout the story. I especially like Mercy. The plot was interesting and kept me reading. My only problem was at times, it was hard to follow. I found myself having to reread paragraphs (or pages) to make sure I understood what was happening. In fact I had to reread the section with the vampires more than once because I was completely confused. I enjoyed reading more about the werewolves and how their dominance works. And I was right in thinking that reading Moon Called (and maybe more of the series) first would have been better when reading Cry Wolf. Overall, still a likeable read."
4,Yeah! Thank you WoodWitchDame!,"What an excellent book! I'm working my way down the Favorite Paranormal Romance Authors List that was put together by WoodWitchDame (thank you, by the way, for all your work on that) and was getting a little discouraged. I was finding very few that I enjoyed. But thank you for Kelley Armstrong (Darkest Powers) and now Patricia Briggs. The only reason I took off a star was for the imbicilic cover. Seriously, I've worked on cars and while I'm in decent shape, I can honestly say I've never tied my shirt up under my boobs to change the oil. So, rip off the cover and sit back and enjoy the story, cuz I just found myself a new series. Thank you Briggs."
3,Glad I stayed with the series,"I wasn't feeling this book at first, but I stuck with it. Now, I am glad I did, the next 2 or 3 books in the series are amazing!"
5,A gem!,"I don't know why people compare Patricia Brigg's Mercy Thompson series to Kim Harrison's books. Briggs is at least 10x better in plot development, character development and writing styles. Brigg's characters are more complex yet believable. The twists in plots are pleasant surprises."
3,Couldn't Hold a Candle to LKH,This book was just okay for me. It was a slow read and only a little interesting.Mercy is a shapeshifter that turns into a coyote. She gets involved with some werewolves and vampires and they solve a crime together. It seems like Briggs is setting this up to be a series because she introduces so many characters. The characters are kind of interesting but really have no sparks or chemistry between them.
3,Briggs,"Too much copy-cat from the original authors in this genre. Engaging though, and a reader new to the genre would enjoy it without requiring too much paranormal knowledge."
1,Drawn out to say the least,"I hate to say this, but this book is very disappointing. I can't believe people are giving this anything above a 2 star. There is no excitement, romance or anything to keep your attention. I have read manyparanormal-romance-thriller series (Night Huntress, Vampire Academy, and the Sookie Stackhouse series are all wonderful) and I still can't get over how let down I was by this book. The author spends so much time describing everything that there is little conversation between the characters. I kept reading and reading thinking that is was only because it was the first book of the series, but the book never got any better."
1,"Not ""The Next Big Thing""","I picked up the Mercy Thompson series on the recommendation of a friend. After reading the ""Twilight"" series, I was looking for a new supernatural/fantasy series, but boy was I disappointed! ""Moon Called"" was so terrible that I didn't even finish. I read the first few chapters and couldn't bring myself to continue. This series is NOT what it's cracked up to be! I am shocked at all of the positive reviews, because nothing about this book is good. The writing is simple, the story isn't intriguing, and the characters are one-dimensional. Do not waste your time on this book."
5,one of his best!,"I love all his books. This one of the best he has written, complex, multi-layer, engaging."
1,A boring waste of money,"I am so mad I believed all the good reviews this book received. I bought it and could not even finish it. I forced myself to make it halfway then I gave up. I kept waiting for something to happen but it never did.First of all the plot was lame. And as another writer points out, there were tons of waste. Probably to make the word count.Second, because it was written in first person, you never got any interaction from the other characters. This leaves you with only what could be ""seen"" from the heroine, who by the way was also boring, leaving flat characters that had potential but couldn't deliver.Not sure if this was fantasy fiction or paranormal, but I won't be reading another by this author.Wish I could get my money back."
4,wonderful,"A great start to a new werewolf series, although Mercy techincally is a shifter, not a were. Some bad things are happening to the weres in Mercy's community and she is obliged to help out her aplhpa neighbor to solve the case. A great read, with a good sequel. This is a promising series."
3,Very little romance,"I still enjoyed the book & will read the rest in the series because I like the characters. But, its not a romance! So don't expect much sizzle."
5,Well worth your time,I usually prefer a series in this genre to focus on a different character each book but this one is definitely an exception. Mercy is always the main character but you're always getting new background on her and all of the other lovable (and hatable) characters. I have read all four books and really enjoyed every one.
3,Thoughts about the book. . .,"Somewhat interesting story about a shapeshifting human and her werewolf friends. Sometimes difficult to follow. I'm not sure I completely understand the conflict or the resolution. . . The book was somewhat entertaining and had a few twists. At this time, I don't think I will want to read the next 3 books in the series."
4,A good start,"I enjoyed the book but wasn't blown away by it. I've already read the short story ""Alpha and Omega"" and ""Cry Wolf"" so I was a bit familiar with the plot. However, I gave it 4 stars because I found the mystery revolving around the plot to be a bit confusing. Aside from that, I really enjoy the characters, especially Mercy. She's tough and strong but yet still sensitive and vulnerable. The rest of the characters were also nicely balanced. The plot, characters and action were all well written and the story moved through it all effortlessly. There are hints of romance in the book but is not the main focus of the story, although it feels like that story arc will come into its own further down the line."
4,HOWLING FUN!,"This book was awesome! I love the world Mercy seems to live in and I enjoyed learning about Bran and Adam's packs. I have a feeling I am really going to enjoy this series. The writing is well done, better than a lot of the writing in this genre. The story moved along at a great pace. I read that Patricia Briggs signed on for 7 books in this series, and I think that many different plots could spawn from the characters in this book. I can't wait to learn more about Stephan (which it looks like I will in the next book)and some of the other characters as well. I was addicted to Laurell K's first half of the Anita Blake series and then I just became increasingly disappointed. Here's to some fresh blood! I feel hopeful for the future of this series."
4,At her Mercy...,"This book was a good read, fast paced with a few quick turns. Set in an interesting alternative present, Mercy, the mechanic/shapeshifting coyote, tackles the mystery of who is trying to take down the local leader of the werewolf clan. This book is filled with great character developement and action, I'm looking forward to the next one."
4,Excellent book,"A strong woman lead. She doesn't sit back and wait for the alpha male to solve her problems. The alpha male is still in the book, but doesn't put the woman away in his pocket until he wants sex. I was a little annoyed with the vampire angle but this book was still worth every penny."
5,loved this book! didnt expect too.,"I bought this book on a whim cause i liked the art on the cover and the name ""mooncalled"", so i read the first page and it didnt make me gag with boredom. I read it in three days (would have been less if i didnt work). It isnt the greatest book (compared to laurell k. hamilton, nancy a. collins and kim harrison) but it sure is engageing and i had a real hard time putting it down (as in my eyes had to close before my fingers let go).Non stop action, charachters that i really got into, and some mystery and a hint of romance. No sex (to get in the way of the action) no ooooshy goooshy googoo stuff (to gag on) just good characters, nice story, a hint of romance and non stop action. I hope she writes this out as a series as i would like to see how Mercys powers might expand and how her romance with (i wont tell you) might go."
3,Another of the vampire/werewolf genre,"Moon Called is full of characterization, and from a different source that the usual run of ""occult"" genre books, where vampires and/or werewolves and/or fae ""come out of the closet"" and into mainstream society. Our main gal is a mechanic, a grease monkey, but one with connections spanning an entire city (as any good mechanic could do with a good client base.) And all around Mercy are creatures of all sorts, but she is a coyote walker (which isn't explained in too much depth). A lot of things aren't explained in too much depth, except the characters themselves. A lot is packed into one volume, which weighs down a single girl's attempt to resolve the craziness that erupts in her life."
5,Great read,Mercy has one of those tough cookie outer shells but is all soft and squishy inside. I love the whole coyote shifter aspect and I hope to find out more about her and her in future stories.
2,slooooow. tedious. jumbled.,"Bummed that this didn't grab me. It got loads of great reviews and I expected to love it but... didn't. Too many things happening at once, too much focus (unending and tedious dialogue!) on trivial minutiae, and sooo beyond lacking in chemistry/sex appeal of characters...The first couple chapters were good then it just dragged on and on. I pride myself on not giving up easily but had to bag out on this book after halfway point and I *never* do that. It's PG for sure, but that doesn't mean it has to bore the reader. And it did."
4,Gotta love a good series...,"This is the best series of this type that I have found since the Dreamfever series by Karen Marie Monig. I love the characters, but I have noticed that the publishing house for this series allows for a lot more Editorial mistakes than others. It makes for some confusing reading, but the writer is so good she can shine through pictographs. Highly suggested for the fantasy reader!"
4,Buy,"Well worth the read. Great concept, pretty well written - warning: This is an ADDICTIVE SERIES!AMAZON: the requirement for 20+ words is completely stupid."
4,:-),"Very good read could be enjoy by people who enjoyed the twilight books, thought I knew what was coming but was very wrong"
5,Love it!,"Snappy writing, interesting characters, as a die-hard fan of Laurell K. Hamilton and others, I highly recommend this book. THe story moves along well, and she portrays her characters very nicely. I am going to read more of her books!"
5,Fresh and hearty,"I enjoyed this book tremendously. Briggs' version of an entire secret world of vampires, werewolves and other traditional dinizens of the supernatural living right under the noses of everyday people actually holds together without becoming too serious or straining their credibility. Her heroine is believable, and someone who you will quickly learn to love as her wit and special gifts are used in harmony to keep her one step ahead of the forces of darkness. A very good read indeed."
3,A little disappointing,"I was expecting a lot from this book after all the other reviews I read and I was a little disappointed. I feel this book is a trend in modern women fantasy writers. While I love the fact that more women are writing fantasy and sci-fi, I find it disappointing that there is a little trend on the fantasy side that they all have stronge female heroines (no issue here) and there's always some kind of love triangle between her and two other guys. It's starting to seem a little cookie-cut. Almost like fantasy romance (a new genre?!).If you like romance novels but always wanted a fantasy setting, then this is for you. If you're a hardcore fantasy/sci-fi fan and have been reading since Asimov then this is probably not for you. It definitely wasn't for me. Again, I love the fact that more women are writing this genre but wish they wouldn't cater so much to our more ""feminine side"". But then again, maybe this is what fantasy/sci-fi has been missing all these years..."
4,as Good as the early Anita Blake Books,"For those who don't like the recent turn of style in the Anite Blake books from mystery to highly sexualized mystery, this is the book for you.Mercy is a Skinwalker - an all encompassing name for the American Indian shapshifter. Those familiar with Tony Hillerman will recog the nasty type, but Mercy is a wonderful, strong willed character.She has a mysterious young new werewolf show up at her doorstep. He is followed by another two nasty boys, one of whom she kills which annoys the local Alpha Werewolf! And things spiral out of controlWe do have the sexual tension amongst the characters that appeared early in the Anita series, but no actual sex. It is clean enough for young teens and hot enough for the us older readers. I give a solid 4 out of five.It did seem too close to both Bitten and the early Anitas that it wasn't original enough for me to get a 5."
5,"Excellent book!! if you like L.K.H., K. Harrison, K. Armstrong, A. Bishop You'll Love this BOOK!!!","I love this book! It was new and exciting and has a twist on the current scene of the paranormal/underworld! I love this author how she brings in the fae, werewolves, walkers, vampires, etc. into the story line. It kept me reading all night! I couldn't put it down! This is an excellent read!"
3,"Fast paced, but lacks character development","Author seemed to get bored at the end and rushes to the finish, leaving characters undeveloped. There were a few good sections that really got my attention but the ending was predictable and boring."
5,sweet read,The Mercy Thompson series is a fantastic fantasy read keeps you going into this and i wanted to keep reading untill i got to the end.Enjoy!
5,Loving mercy,This book is a good starter book to a series it lets u get to know it characters and start to like them then plays games with u till it not sure who the bad guy is u till she shows u finally and it like oh shoot lol loving it time to buy the next one
3,My Starbuck's recommendation... What an amazing one!,"Who would have thought that a stranger in Starbuck would suggest such an amazing paranormal series and its creative author to me? Well certainly not I... And was I blown away! After reading my downloaded sample and that was the first three books in this series / three days ago, I am now a Patricia Briggs ardent reader. Yipee!Mercy as a petite, female, skinwalking, VW mechanic extinguishes 'Anita Blake' with one exhalation, in the character development arena. While Adam and Samuel, both werewolves, continuously vie for her attention, they do care and love her unconditionally. So far, I've enjoyed reading this series, yet quietly hoping, it does not become hackneyed like the A.B series."
3,Moon Called,Enjoyed this book and the sequel titles. Would recommend to other readers who are looking for a different slant on the usual otherworld genre.
5,"Wow! If I liked it, it's really good!","I loved this book! I'm very picky about what I read-especially in the supernatural genre-and this was excellent. Briggs creates very likable characters and has new ideas on some old legends. The book is fast-paced without losing the detail that brings people and places to life for the reader.I picked this up because it had a good review from my favorite author, Kim Harrison. Moon Called by Patricia Briggs is in league with Harrison's Rachel Morgan series. The genres are obviously similar, but the writing styles and details on the supernatural are different enough to keep it interesting. I hope there will be a long series of these books from Briggs."
4,"Move over Anita Blake, make way for Mercy Thompson","Tired of the ever increasing drama involved in the Anita Blake character in the Vampire Hunter Series? Try Patrica Brigg's Moon Called for a change of pace. This is about a shape changer who is not afraid of who she is. Yes, there is a certain amount of sexual tension between her and other characters in the book, but it does not comsume the plot. In the world of Mercy Thompson, the werewolves are the first to reveal themselves to the public and the vampires are hidden. Mercy is unique kind of shape shifter who is not dependant on the moon. There is also a second book called Blood Bound, if you like the first. I enjoyed both."
5,A quality start to an excellent series,"Moon Called is a great start to a series that keeps getting better. Briggs does an excellent job juggling the story threads, not focusing too much on the romantic entanglements at the expense of the plot, but also taking time to patiently develop the complexity of the relationship triangle. These relationship arcs play out later in the series and are not resolved in this book, however, the main plot mystery is resolved and its progression is handled well.Mercy is an excellent character, with a strong spirit and intelligence. She must sometimes be very clever to get what she wants since the werewolves are stronger than she is, and her relationship to the pack is complex and filled with shifter politics. The complete lack of Too Stupid To Live moments is also refreshing.I recommend this book and the rest of the series without hesitation."
5,AMAZING BOOKS!,I won't give anything away. These books are just amazing! I cannot wait for the next to come out!! Well done Patricia Briggs!!
5,"If you are an avid urban fantasy reader, pick this up!","I had seen this series online for a while now. I read other things so I hadn't gotten to this. Finally, with nothing else sparking my fancy I picked it up. Now I am smacking myself for waiting so long to do so!!! Why oh why did I wait? Anyway, Mercy Thompson an awesome heroine. I love how she doesn't fit to cliches. I read what was available for this series within two days (with many complaints from my DH at all hours that my kindle light was keeping him up).This series rocks. Don't be stupid like I was, pick it up!"
5,Awesome!,The book starts out a little slow but it really picks up. I couldn't put it down!!!!!! I hope there are a lot more books to come in this series!
3,Decent but different than what I thought,"Patricia's stories are very different than what I am used to. I liked the romance angle and the love triangle between the three main characters in addition to the story of her family and the social hierarchy of their world. I couldnt get into the majority of the novel however, because it seemed a little silly. Sorry to say, I really just skimmed through to the parts I wanted to read so I could see what happened with the fun parts. I know many people liked these books and say they are what the Anita Blake series should be. I dont think this is what you are looking for in that case. This is a totally different type of story and writing that you may not enjoy."
5,Great new find,"I've been getting luckier than usual with paranormal writers recently. For a while there, it seemed that every book I picked up was either written poorly or had a blah plot or characters I didn't care about. But lately I've discovered several great new authors, and Patricia Briggs is one of them. I've read the first two books in this series and really enjoyed them. I have book 3 but haven't gotten to it yet but hopefully soon. mercy is a great character, strong but sympathetic and not gaining new powers every five minutes. She makes the books for me, along with Ms. Briggs' great writing. Looking forward to book 3!"
3,Fun...but needs work,"Briggs is a talented storyteller and gives her protagonist/narrator a wry sense of humor and plenty of emotional depth. She makes for a wonderful guide through this often funny and exciting tale.Unfortunately, the story was not as strong as some of the characters. With about a hundred pages to go, the plot becomes an absolute mess, making very little sense, and at times the ""alpha male"" device gets a bid old. Here's hoping the author thinks more carefully about her next effort."
1,Doctor Visit...,"I definitely do NOT recommend this product. When I first used it, it worked beautifully- went on easy, stayed on all day. However, after 2 uses, it almost completely dried out. I would shake it to get some color back in, but it wasn't a lot. After about 4 days of use, my lips became EXTREMELY dry. I mean, I don't think my lips have ever been that dry in me entire life. They became so dry that they were cracking, bleeding, and very painful. Chapsticks weren't touching the stuff at all, and I ended up having to go to the doctor to get a prescription for my lips, and skin removal because there was so much crusted on skin that was not sloughing off. Ouch! This stuff cost me a doctor's visit and nearly ruined my lips. Will never use again. There are safer lip stains out there."
5,Great ip Liner,i LOVE it.... I chose a darker color..which is fine when I work...But thinking of buying a lighter color for those days I am at home and need a little bit of color. It lived up to its description.
1,Sibelius,The CD itself is defective. It is jerky. So the music skips around. Not at all satisfying. Can I get a replacement?
3,Not impressed,"When I first played this disc, the opening bars of Finlandia made me excited for the rest of the album. Unfortunately, I was only disappointed. Although Karajan's Finlandia is well done, it seems that this success is only due to the simplicity of the work.The 2nd Symphony was where the majority of my problems lay. Despite the lush beauty of string playing that the BPO is famous for, the orchestra's sound is too often imbalanced, the strings sometimes obliterating the winds. Also, it seems, during the final two movements, especially, that too many sacrifices are made for the sake of speed and volume. The intonation is, at times, horrendous, and the symphony's glorious conclusion is ruined by the thoughtless, strident brass playing. There are many recordings available, I just picked the wrong one."
3,Now only available as DVD-R?,"A number of ""boutique labels"" have started using the DVD-R and CD-R/Made-On-Demand format for some of their older inventory. Most, like VCI, will state up front on their website this change. Image, however, has recently turned to the DVD-R format for a number of titles in their catalog without giving the consumer any warning of what they are getting on their website. Nor, unlike VCI, do their prices currently reflect the cheaper format now being used. It's sad that such a unique historical animation compilation has fallen into this category. If it weren't for the DVD-R notice Amazon included on its listing, the potential buyer would have had no warning of the change in product. The contents are an incredible look back at the early days of stop-motion animation which, like the consumer, deserve better. Had it not been for that, this would have earned a 4 or 5 star rating."
2,Amateur Writing for Amateur Sleuth,"The theory and storyline of this book had potential; however, it was a chore to complete. Unfinished descriptions, predictable false leads and a lackluster climax will keep me from other novels by this author."
4,"Solutions Because, Life is Unfair!","Ever wanted to know how to deal with an evil gym teacher, avoid hand me down clothes, get away with not doing your homework, stay up late or build an effective alibi? Well Malcolm has all the answers to these and other of life's dilemmas.This book is pretty funny with the same sort of humour as the show. Malcolm writes like he does when he talks to the camera on the show. The book is a little bit dated as it is set a few years ago and a lot has changed on the brilliant TV show in that time. It is still a great read and a must for fans of the funniest show on TV at the moment. Not just for kids, readers of all ages will love this."
4,For Kids Only,"As stated on the cover this is for kids only! It's so funny and even if you never use anything in it it's really fun to read. The author really talks like a kid infact they talk like Malcolm. I think adults wouldn't really get the humer in it like kids but i would recomended it to any kid even if you don't like to read cause it's quick and easy, I don't like to read that much but i just sat down and read this. Remember this is for Kids only!"
2,Right button died in 10 months,"The cable is too dry (I guess because of the metal shield, but this was the first time I saw such a thing).The right button died in less than 10 months (I only use my PC at night and weekends). The one I had was made in China."
1,Awful,"This mouse was awful. I had bought another no name optical mouse in the past and it continously jumped all over the screen. But I thought I would give the optical mouse ONE more try, and I bought a Microsoft, thinking It would be much better (being microsoft and all), but, guess what? It did the extact same thing!. So far as to exit me right off line a few times! Never again will I buy an optical mouse, I don't care WHO makes it!"
1,Not what I wanted,The product was a plain and simple laptop mouse. I wanted a regular desktop mouse and the add claimed to be just that. It was not and had a 2 ft cord instead of the advertised cord of 5 plus feet.
2,NOT a children's mouse!,"This mouse turned up on a search for a children's size mouse so I bought it for my 3 year old. I didn't bother to read the package because I could see the mouse was small and it looked right, so I opened it up to find it has an incredibly SHORT cord. I couldn't understand this, so I looked at the package and it says it is for use with laptops! That explains the shortness of the cord, but I want a mouse for my son to connect to my deskstop, which this one does not do. Now I can either go through the red tape of returning the product, which won't be easy since the package is open or I can spend more money on an USB extension cord.The bottom line is, this mouse should NOT be turning up as a children's mouse without more info regarding its short cord."
5,"small, simple and sweet!","Got this for a new notebook computer because I hate using touchpads. Also, I didn't want to fiddle with batteries and since it will be mainly a desktop replacement computer rather than a road warrior one, didn't mind having a cord.The cord is kind of interesting-looking, not the same color as the mouse which is rather unusual, and is extra long so I keep it tied up with the wire tie it came with.Only gripe is that having to keep the cord partially tied up makes the mouse sort of move on its own whenever I let go of it due to the tension in the cord.Otherwise I love it: it's just the right size, the scroll wheel also doubles as a button, everything feels great ergonomically."
3,Cable NOT 6' long!!!,"Unfortunately I bought this item assuming that the other reviewers here gave an accurate description, that the cable is 6' long. Well I just received it today and the cable is around 3' long. I guess over the years, Microsoft chopped the cable in half. So do NOT buy this if, like me, you are expecting a 6' long cable, it's actually fairly short and thus it is nearly unusable for a desktop, only good for laptops."
3,Cheap but stiffly wired,"The price is unbeatable, but the wire attached to this mouse is so stiff it is always making its presence felt more than I want."
2,loud click!,"Desired a small non wireless mouse for an international flight. The loud click (right and left) would disturb the other passengers, though. The search for a small non wireless mouse continues..."
3,short cord,"BEWARE the cord on this mouse will not reach to the back of a desktop, other than that it works well"
3,The product has changed,"I just bought my 4th one of these from Amazon and was disappointed that the product has changed without any indication on the product page.The product is still small and light and easy on the arm and shoulders during extended use.However, gone is the 6 foot silver cable and in its place is a 3 foot black cable (the product picture still shows the silver cable).Another drawback is the buttons seem louder when clicking. This may be because my other ones are older and broken in but I don't think so.If you are looking for a LAPTOP-ONLY mouse, the new version may do the trick for you. However, if you use it for both laptop use and docking station use, the cable is not long enough.For my use, the changes turned a 5-star product into a 3-star product."
2,Not what I expected from Microsoft,"While there are many with less than positive things to say about Microsoft software, their mice and keyboards have generally been well-received. Because of this, I chose to try this mouse. It was more comfortable than I expected, considering my large hands, but after a month, it started going south. It developed the annoying habit of causing the pointer to jump randomly about the screen. These are large, screen-crossing leaps. On more than one occasion, the pointer has jumped to the upper right corner of the screen, turning a click of ""OK"" into a closed program. I'm probably going to go Kensington or Logitech for the next mouse."
3,Frank Tannenbaum,"Frank Tannenbaum started as an anarchist and a radical, then became a great scholar of Latin America (especially Mexico), but had a varied career as a journalist. This book confronts the troublesome features of the American South--its horrible penal system, its parched subculture of mill-workers and their families, and of course the cruelties of the region's racism."
2,movie sucks!!,one of the stupidest and most boring movies i ever seen. too much drama in it thats for sure and the acting was terrible. enough said
1,Another Lo-performance,"Jennifer Lopez should definately hang up her acting shoes. J-lo is over-rated and I'm sure overpaid. This movie was a flop with the exception of James Caveziel who should be more particular who he teams up with in the future. J-lo, leave it alone doll."
2,lies,"By the title ""Angel Eyes"" I thought this movie was gonna be about an angel, like the woman or man died and is in the film, but no its just a stupid title. This movie gives you nothing, its just two stubborn people meeting and liking eachother. The movie is stupid. I am mad I paid money to see it."
1,i would go lower than i one if it were possible,this may easily be one of the dumber movies made in the last hundred years. and there were a lot of them. this definitely ranks up in the 10%-tile.
4,Very different.,"I hadn't even planned on seeing this movie, but it happened. The film is NOT one of the Hollywood garbage pieces. In fact, I wondered how someone got funding to do a REAL movie for once. Jennifer Lopez keeps your attention through-out the movie, and for anyone who wants to see a woman in a strong role (for once), she manages it. No nonsense. At first, I was upset with how her family behaves toward her, but then I realized...this movie is about real life. For anyone who wants to see a movie well-acted with a completely different feel to it...this is an excellent choice to see. And you will feel the adrenaline pumping through you when she is yelling at her brother for the wicked thing he did."
3,J Lo's psychological drama,Not a movie for Friday night. Its a little different melodramatic love story with a bit of weird and a little funny psychological drama. Its a very slow movie. A female cop(J Lo) meets a weird guy and falls in love with him. She discovers about his past life and tries to help him with his psychological problem while she is trying to do her best in the relationships with her own and brother. The ending is obvious.
4,i belive in angels,"the movie angel eyes starring jennifer lopez is a very good real drama that doesn't follow the usual cliches most police dramas do,it had realness a story about to very lonely souls facing their own problems come together and find love,a very well acted well written movie"
4,Jennifer's Best Performance Yet,"This movie was a big stretch for Pop Singer Jennifer Lopez. When I first saw her in Selena, I thought she was okay. but after seeing her in the flop Anaconda and the sappy romatic comedy The Wedding Planner, I thought I was going to puke. However, Angel Eyes is a different story. They mix in the romance with real life and the problems that come with it. The cinematography is great! And the chemistry between her and Jim Cavziel is wonderful. The soundtrack is also good - I would reccomend it to all music-lovers. Angel Eyes may not go down as an instant classic, but it is a display of Jennifer Lopez's best work and it's a huge shock for anyone who thinks she has no talent as an actress."
4,"LUIS MANDOKI, OPUS 7","***1/2 2001. Directed by Luis Mandoki. Chicago. A female police officer, with family problems, falls in love with a strange man who refuses to accept that his family died in a car crash the year before. This film could have been worse. What I liked about this movie were its atmosphere and Lopez and Caviezel's performances, what I disliked were the scenes involving Jennifer Lopez's family which I found very badly written and not natural at all. Nonetheless, I recommend ANGEL EYES to those of you who are desperately researching an adult film for a rainy week-end."
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:","JLO IS A CHICAGO COP WHO IS EMBITTERED BY HER OWN FAMILY LIFE OF SPOUSAL ABUSE. SHE MEATS CATCH, WHO WOULD APPEAR TO BE A TRANSIENT STREET WALKER BUT HE SAVES HER LIFE WHEN SHE IS ALMOST KELLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. HE HAS THE MOST AMAZING EYE'S THAT DRW YOU RIGHT IN. SHE BECOMES MORE AND MORE ENTRANCES BY CATCH. IN THE END SHE FINDS OUT THE SHE HAS SAVED HIS LIFE. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. JM"
5,Great Acting!,"Angel Eyes is actually a very excellent movie. Though I've only seen it twice ( both times on HBO when the cable company goofed up J). It's the type of movie with no action but allows you to care for the characters. I rarely like movies without some hint of action but this one got underneath the skin. Others have already given the rundown of the movie so I won't bore you there but the acting is very excellent. The guy ( High Crimes and Frequency) is very talented at the dumbfounded I-Don't-Know-Who-I-Am roles and he plays this one to a T. Jennifer Lopez flaunts which is most likely her best acting performance as of now in Angel Eyes. Each character displays myriads of emotions throughout the movie be it anger, confusion, joy, fear, sadness, or resent. I really liked this movie and plan on purchasing it in the near future. 5 Stars."
3,"Romantic, heart-warming, and thrilling","I saw this film with my boyfriend, and, in my opinion, ANGEL EYES is a romantic, heart-warming, and thrilling romantic thriller. If you ask me, Sharon (Jennifer Lopez) and Catch (James Caviezel) made a perfect couple. One of the things I liked most about this film is when Catch played the trumpet when he and Sharon went out to the nightclub. They made the perfect couple, if you ask me. In conclusion, I HIGHLY recommend this romantic, heart-warming, and thrilling romantic thriller to all you Jennifer Lopez fans out there who have not seen it. You're in for a real treat, so, go to the theater with a friend and see it."
5,Beautiful movie,I was skepical of this at first. I wasnt sure if I really liked Jennifer Lopez as an actress. After watching this movie all skepisiam was gone. this has become of my favorite movies. It a very touching tale of a women police officer who is dealing with demons of her past and in the mean time falling in love with a mysterious man who happens into her life. Little does she know but this is a man who life she saved. The help each other heal old wounds and fall in love. A truely touching story. Grab your tissue if you plan to watch this on and most of Enjoy!
2,Is there a plot here somewhere?,"Where exactly is the plot in this movie? As a showcase for J-Lo, it's fine; as a movie with something interesting to say, it fails miserably. Don't waste your money."
4,another movie i liked more than thought i would...,"j-lo shocked me...she picked a very tough character with some depth... jennifer plays sharon, a chicago cop, with some issues with her dad who is a domestic abuser...then she's saved from death in the middle of a botched arrest by catch, played by jim caviezel ( saving private ryan, frequency ) and of course, you know, they end up falling for each other, but he has some issues of his own to deal with...the mood of this movie is strange, yet lopez and caviezel have undeniable chemistry between them which makes their romance believeable...caviezel is extremely impressive as catch..."
4,Don't skip this movie,"About relationships and love, I was surprised by the realness of it. Angel Eyes was a huge breath of fresh air after sitting through some other standard-issue blockbusters these past few weeks."
2,I want my money back!!,"This movie is not what I thought it was going to be based on the commericals...I was expecting something like the Sixth Sense, but this movie is more like a long-drawn out melodrama...it takes forever for the movie to get anywhere. I give it 2 stars instead of one because J-Lo did a good acting job in it. It's ok that it wasn't in the horror/sci-fi genre but it didn't succeed in whatever genre it was trying to be in."
1,"Dull, slow, bad acting","Ugh. After seeing this movie I wanted to demand the two and a half hours of my life back. The character of ""Catch"" in this movie is the most incredibly dull character I have ever seen in my life. J-Lo was good, but half of the plot line (about her and her interactions with physically abusive men) seemed to go nowhere and serve no purpose.This is basically a movie about two pathetically sad people that fall in love. In my opinion, casting these particular two people made no sense. I never bought the fact that this hot, tough Chicago cop would ever fall this some quiet, dark loner.I thought this was a dull, rambling movie. Save your money and skip it."
1,BAAAD,My friend and I thought there was going to be more to this movie. We waited for the credits to roll when we figured out that nothing was going to happen. We got our money back.
1,HOW BAD CAN A MOVIE BE?,"I can't beleive all the positive reviews for this movie! What movie is everyone watching? Certainly not the one I watched.Angel Eyes is as bad as they get. Pick a plot. All of them stank ---poor writing, and poor directing to boot. I don't blame the actors. No actor could have saved this dog.This is a good example of a movie that should have never been made."
1,Waste time & Money to watch such poor movie,"This is a very bad and boring movie. Story is so bad. No suprise at all. Well, it's suprised to find out somebody can make such movie.If you are the fans of Jennifer Lopez and would like to see some sexy scene from her, you will be absolutely disappointed.I want my money back for the ticket and the bottle of water."
4,Good chick flick :),"If you like chick flicks and like Jennifer Lopez (I'll speak for most guys and say, ""who doesn't"" :) you will definitely like this movie.Was it the best love story of the last 15 years (as was advertised by the woman I work with that recommended it to me claims)? Not in my view, but it makes the top 20.Better love stories in my humble opinion include Wedding Planner, American President, You've Got Mail, Six Days and Seven Nights, Meet Joe Black, Hope Floats, City of Angels, etc. You get the picture.You definitely won't go wrong with Angel Eyes. Tis very cool!"
5,enjoyable love story,my wife and i watched this movie this week and enjoyed it very much. i had read some reviews before hand and after watching it don't get where some people thought this was a ghost story. but in a way it was a ghost story of hurts in sharon's and catch's life not some strange ghost story. this is just a very good love story that made you sad and happy. my wife did a lot of crying during this movie and i have to admit it was a good enough story that i was also a big cry-baby during this one. so if you like a plain good old love story and like having a good cry get this one.
3,Fell in love with Catch....started to like Sharon...,"Catch is great character in this movie. I thought the movie was a little predictable...but for what it is, the storyline is at least interesting enough to follow and the character of Catch made the entire movie fun for me.There were, however, parts of the movie that were just insane....the guy just tossing a fingerprinted weapon (hilarious or really stupid)...and Lopez literally man-handling men twice her size (big leap of faith).Overall, a good something to watch, but no really great movie. =)"
2,"Okay, disapointing","This is one of the most disapointing movies of 2001, it has no character to it! It's just plain sad, and bad! It's just a love story between Lopez and a guy! Well, it kinda really sucked!! No delight is brought to the screen, everything's serious and boring, I've seen worse, but this is bad! It was a good try and parts of it were a bit exciting, like the chase! Anyways, skip this movie, no good!!"
4,Angel Eyes,Angel Eyes any movie with Jim Caveziel(sp) is great in my opinion. I think this is the first movie I saw him in and I really thought it was a great chick flick.
3,What is it about J. LO?,"No matter who she's playing, Jennifer Lopez has the ability to draw me to the screen. I don't like her music, refuse to by her CDs, but if it's a music video or a movie, I feel compled to watch. I may not like her, but the girl knows how to speak to the cammera. Though the trailer seems a little misleading, I wasn't disappointed to find out the story was more a romance than a thriller or mystery. Jennifer has never failed to make me belive in her characters and ""Angel Eyes"" is no exception. ... you Miss Lopez, I want to not like your screen work, but I do."
3,"Angel Eyes, an interesting new view of romance","Angel Eyes was a par movie. It was not what you would think, you are not paying to see J. LO naked, in fact you dont see her naked. THis is however an engaging romance about a cop (lopez) who meets a ""guarding angel"" type figure (Cazaveil). It turns into a love story, and is a decent one. This was not a great movei and at times was weepy. If you have the choice go for another flick, if you dont, dont be upset its a good flick but i would have waited for video"
2,DishNetwork!,I bought this as a replacement for a 311 and DishNetwork would not activate it. They say they no longer support this DVR.
5,Must read,Every young psychotherapist should have to read Rollo May or some of the other existential humanistic therpapists. Homework assignments may change behavior but presence changes both the client and therapist!
4,Late Night Discussions on the Theory of Constraints,"If you have already read other books by Dr. Goldratt, this is one to add to your collection and take with you for reading when time is short. It does not read as smoothly as do his other books, and at times I found myself reading a paragraph a second or third time because it was not initially clear whether it was Dr. Goldratt speaking, or Alex.Still, this is a good book, and one I might compare with ""Breakfast with Socrates"" by Robert Rowland Smith. I make this comparison because it really takes a considerable amount of concentration and reflection of the material to fully grasp what it is that Dr. Goldratt is trying to say. Would I recommend this book? Yes, I think I would, but not as the first one to read by Dr. Goldratt, rather as one to read after understanding his other publications."
1,Changing Changer,"Don't let the Yamaha name fool you; this is a piece of junk! This product performed great for maybe four months. Then it started changing tracks on its own. Sometimes it just picked another point in the playing track, sometimes it went back to the start of a track. It would play perfectly for a day or so, then start acting up again. I paid a good low price on Amazon for it, so I guess I got what I paid for ... a throw-away (and I did throw it away). The manual and the web site were no help at all, since it is neither on a vibrating surface nor are any of my disks dirty or marred, which is the extent of the manual's troubleshooting.A lesson was learned here: buy quality, not name, and not price."
5,Yamaha CDC-585 - CD changer - black,this product is exactly as advertised and i am very pleased with it. good job amazon/crutchfield. i wish all transactions went this smooth.
5,MUST HAVE for your coolscan,"This attachment ads a completely new dimension to your CoolScan scanner, bulk feed your scanned negatives, roughly 45minutes later you have 36 4000dpi scans. What more can you want.? for what it is worth, if you scan with ICE expect the scan time for a full roll to increase to roughly 1:15 hour.Highly Recommended."
4,humminbird fish finder pirhana max 215,"Works fine, somewhat erratic at high speedsWorks fine, somewhat erratic ay high speed"
4,Strange and worthy,"Elliptical melodies and a singing style that borders on the bizarre make this a truly adventurous effort and worthy of a listen. The Movies' vision is a strange one, but ultimately it is their own. 4 Stars"
2,The book was so much better . . .,"There is a difference between melancholy and lifeless. A lot of reviewers have compared The Movies to Joy Division, mostly because lead singer Timmothy James strains to capture Ian Curtis' dour baritone. But their failed attempt to ape their influencers ends up making The Movies sound like amateurish wannabes, lacking songs, chops, and conviction. Even songs that show some promise musically fail to succeed: ""Autograph,"" one of the catchier songs on the album, is hobbled by James' hokey, repetitious delivery. There are some pretty passages here and there, like the coda on ""A Better Life,"" but they are too rare to salvage this snoozer of an album."
3,Fonts do not work on Kindle edition,"I'm sure this is a wonderful paperback, but stay away from the Kindle edition. The font used to indicative accent and vowel length is tiny and barely legible."
3,Not one of Scott's better works.,"Yet another good, but not great book by Col. Scott. The more he strays from the plots of his earlier works, the weaker his books seem to get. The characters were extremely predictable as well as the books outcome. As always, the action is outstanding, but the gratuitous love scenes are silly. I expect Fabio to be on the next cover. If you don't mind thumbing through the senseless love story passages, you will probably enjoy the action in this book."
5,really freakin' good,"This really is a great toothbrush. No lie. My teeth have never felt so clean. It's the best toothbrush I've ever had. I definitely recommend it to everyone.I don't know what problems these other clowns had. The battery lasts, the toothbrush brushes, and it does it quite well."
3,typical ibm book,"Let's just say if you have lot of time, you can try using method described in the book. But for lot of people in business of delivering the products in time, this may not be a good book to get influence from. There are some interesting examples in there that may be useful, but using as a reference....hmmmm.....think twice. There was an article published in ACM Interactions magazine while ago where they reviewed using OVID method, and they also came into same conclusion: high learning curve and implementation time was too long.Book itself was simple to read, well at least for me. There are lot of examples, but I found them inconsistent. You may want to try IBM's website to get more information on OVID if you don't want to buy the book."
3,Untitled,"This is the third volume of Neil Norman's synth-pop versions of Science Fiction music. If you are into Science Fiction soundtracks, you will probably enjoy it. Although ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" isn't Science Fiction by any stretch of the imagination. Like on the other albums in this series, Neil cheats a little by throwing in a couple of his own original compositions that weren't actually written for television or the movies (""Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet"" and ""Into the Alternate Universe"".) There is an unlisted 19th track here, which is a barely audible recording of a woman saying, ""You have just interfaced the Greatest Science Fiction Hits by Neil Norman."""
3,"Neil Norman - 'Greatest Science Fiction Hits, Volume 3' (GNP Crescendo)","Have never been THAT huge of fan of TV themes as such, at least not enough to buy many CD's like this one. But a friend of mine suggested that I check this nineteen track release out. It's decent. I remember a good most of these TV shows and movie themes. Ones I liked best were ""Land Of The Giants"", ""Space 1999 II"", ""Lost In Space I & II"", ""E.T."" (who could forget this flick?), ""Flash Gordon"" and ""War Of The Worlds"". Sure to bring back some fond memories."
3,The Story of an Unbelievable Monster!,"Let's face it, the picture says a thousand words. He looks like a mad man. The book does a decent job in recollecting who perhaps done an unforgettable crime. A woman was nearly murdered but survived with artifical hands because Larry Singleton chopped them off to prevent identification but she was still alive and she survived miraculously. Years later, she would recall the crime after he was freed to roam to again and kill again. The book does a thorough job in explaining the background but we'll never know why he did the unthinkable in destroying his first victim's life who was tormented and begged for him to stay in prison. They were wrong to let him loose on the streets and now he is in prison for the rest of his life but judging from the photograph, it may not be long."
1,Monsturd,"I cannot resist a bad horror film. I saw this movie and thought it would be worth a laugh but I was wrong. The film is slow, offers no gore, and the monster looked like it was made out of Vienna sausages. If Troma made this movie it would have been 100% better but it's not. Avoid this movie it's not worth your time even if you like stupid horror films."
2,Gets a #2 rating for obvious reasons,"This movie looked and sounded like a porno without the sex. I knew before watching it that it wasn't going to be very good and I was not disappointed. But the ""actors"" and filmmakers knew this film was going to be a stinker, so they filled it with quite a few silly props and dialogue that made up for the awful-ness of it all. It's worth renting if you're in the mood for something really stoopid, but I wouldn't spend good money on it."
3,"Ridiculous, Stupid, and Very Funny!!!","Wow, what did I just watch? This is exactly what you'd expect it to be. An escaped convict falls into toxic waste in the sewer and becomes a poop monster and begins killing people when they use the toilet. If you want a dumb monster movie, you'll enjoy MONSTURD!!!"
3,toilet humor?,"ok so this movie is a ""B"" film and on that scale I gave it a 3 cause its watchable not really the side splitting laugh out loud comedy that you might be exspecting from the world of bad acting but it is an original idea and they did an ok job of polishing up this turd (literally) anyways if your looking for a crap film (pun intended) this is it, otherwise just wait till you can stream it on netflix cause the only real reason I bought this was cause I have a huge zombie movie colection and the sequle to this is about zombies and I hate to have an incomplete colection ;) so for the colector you might want to pick up a copy but for the rest of you this is an easy skip"
3,A downgrade from previous editions,"The Times Atlas made its reputation by being the best atlas in the English Language. In previous editions, its detail and scale was as good as you could get(except for the briefly available and slightly less comprehensive Book of the World from Macmillan). This latest edition may still be better than anything else out there, but I haven't bought it even though I'd like to update. I've looked it over in stores, and the user who noted the reduced scales is right on the mark. I think all of the map scales have been reduced somewhat from earlier editions. He's probably also right about the clarity of the cartography. All in all, I'd say they had poor judgment in downgrading. This was the atlas for people who really knew maps, wanted the best and were willing to pay for it. Now it's a disappointment."
4,Judgment suspended,"I wanted to update my 25-year-old Rand McNally International Atlas, and based on various reviews, it seemed that the Times Comprehensive 11th ed was the top of the line, so I purchased it. Imagine my disappointment when the first thing I looked up in it was missing. A friend had taken a recent trip to see the temples at Bagan, Myanmar, which is that country's number one tourist destination. However, none of the 7 plates in the Times Comprehensive 11th ed that depicted the central Myanmar region where Bagan is located actually showed that important site. By contrast, my old Rand McNally atlas has only one plate depicting Myanmar, but Bagan is on it. Based on this initial disappointment,and given its high price, I would need to gain a lot more positive experience with the Times Comprehensive 11th ed before I would recommend it unreservedly to others."
5,Great Anthology of Akkadian Literature,"This is a great anthology of Akkadian literature. It may be one of the best English translations of Akkadian literature of this magnitude. It contains the lost poetry and prose of ancient Assyria and Babylonia. There are over 300 works in this volume, including some of the world's oldest literature. Please note that there are two volumes. The first volume contains introductions to Akkadian literature, language, poetry, and prose. It also contains specific eras such as the Archaic Period (2300-2000 B.C.), the Classical Period (2000-1500 B.C.), and the Mature Period (1500-1000 B.C.). The second volume contains hymns, prayers, and the Akkadian literature of the Late Period (1000-100 B.C.).Another book I would recommend if you like this one is S.N. Kramer's Sumerian Mythology. It is part of the series ""Memoirs of The American Philosophical Society from Independence Square, Philadelphia 1944."
5,Wunderlich worths all the money you paid for this CD,"The 7 songs sung by Wunderlich worths all the money for this 18 tracks CD, and you get Placido Domingo and Peter Schreier as bonus. My opinion is that there's no tenor who can replace Wunderlich."
4,Nasty Gal Sees Long Delayed Success,"I really enjoy most of the cuts on this CD. Betty Davis had or has a real and gritty talent. You can hear how she's physically into the tunes and I love the way that energy sucks you in. The listener can also hear the impact and sound of Miles on some of the tracks, which is another plus in my book for the album's musical integrity."
5,betty davis is the black diamond!,"get this album! betty davis is the nastiest girl in the history of funk. all the songs are excellent. it's raw, nasty, real FUNK!""don't you be afraid, i'm not playing hard to get, you say you want it and you got it right now. take it all now!"" as Betty says it."
3,Good but not great,"Although this translator is useful, the vocabulary list is much too small, and the computerized voice is sometimes impossible to understand.Helpful functions include the currency converter and the universal clock. But for this price, this machine should have a much larger vocabulary list."
2,Terrible Calendar.,I buy this calendar hoping that it would have several different pictures of the eight Doctors. They should have name it Dr. Who and Daleks Calendar. Almost all the pictures are from the Peter crushing movie or comic book-like pictures. There is only one of Tom Baker and one of John Petwee. This calendar should be only for major Dr. Who and Dalek fans.
4,fresh approavh,"I've been listenning to bossa for many years. Sometimes I think I could listen to old songs forever, but occasionally I feel I want to listen to something new but have been quite dissapointed with new artists. This album has brought an oasis for modern approach to the old masterpieces."
5,Essick Water Bottle Caps,"Just bought these because of a customer that came into my store looking for them. He told me he couldn't find them anywhere and since I had just bought a new Essick humidifier with these same water bottles, I thought I'd just get the bottle tops in case something happened to ones that came with the unit."
3,I'm Not Ticked-Off That I Saw This Movie,"As someone else mentioned, Ticked-Off Trannies With Knives is like a cross between I Spit On Your Grave and a John Waters movie. Only it's not as edgy as I Spit on your Grave and it's not as funny as a John Waters film. I liked the first half better, which has several laughs and surprises. However, I found the second half to be not that great until the bloody climax. And with a title like this, I expected to see a lot of trannies-stabbing-people kind of action. Unfortunately, there's not much of that until near the end. Still, I'm not ticked-off that I saw Ticked-Off Trannies With Knives."
5,INSTANT CULT CLASSIC!!!! A DEFINITE MUST SEE!!!,"This movie is awesome!!! I laughed, clapped, yelled and cheered!!! Everyone who saw this film at every film festival, which sold out at each and every screening including Tribeca in NYC, LOVED IT!!!!! I totally recommend this film!!!!!!!!"
5,A surprisingly funny and well-made film,"I watched this one night while bored, and I was surprised at how genuinely funny it was; the characters were fleshed out incredibly well, and the storyline (while a little extreme), is at least believable. Best of all, the protagonists don't come off as the media stereotypes of what a transgendered person should be; they are, for all intents and purposes, extremely likeable in their own ways, and allow anyone watching the film to feel some compassion for what these individuals endure. Don't let the close minded prudes and homophobes dissuade you from watching what could very well be the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" of our time (well, maybe not, but it sure deserves cult status as the funniest revenge film that stars trannies ever made)."
4,Don't Drop The Soap,My girlfriend and I can't wait for the final season to come out even though we heard it kinda sucked. Seasons 1 and 2 were great but kinda went downhill without Benson. *snaps fingers and turns invisible*
5,Pure nostaglia!,"For anyone who remembers this show a second look back at the days when you didn't have to be politically correct is a refreshing treat. Great performances and sharp writing make this a very funny show. Benson was more funny than Saunders, but everyone in the cast is spot on. You can have endless fun just laughing at the clothes from that time period. The fact that they just cancelled the show after this season and didn't let them have a finale was criminal!"
3,Great Show - horrible presentation,"I didn't get a real chance to watch this as a kid, but all these years later, this show is still better and radical than anything getting run on network TV this season. That includes the housewives. For this final season, I expected at least another interview segment with the creators talking about what ended this show's run. Was there plans for season 5? Well all this stuff will probably end up in a book somewhere.Once again Sony disappoints in the quality department. Did they master these DVDs off a bunch of EP speed tapes? It's just hideous transfers that ruin the legacy of a show that deserves its reputation of being unorthodox and filled with talent. It's nice that they put all four seasons out, but why couldn't they have made an effort?"
5,Soap - The Complete Fourth Season,"Just as marvelous as the first three seasons. Of course, the series isn't quite as ""scandalous"" as when it was first released. The only disappointment I have with the fourth season is that it was the last. There are no more. So, savor these. They're a treasure. Great exercise for the laugh muscles."
3,A classic ends,"If you love SOAP, or even like it, you've got to get the COMPLETE series. How could you not?As a season, 4 wasn't the funniest or the most moving, but it was still (mostly) SOAP. And the ending, tho not intended as a final ending, actually works very well. (I've filled in the blanks many times over the years...)"
5,very funny,wish it would have kept goingwould have liked to see morehad to buy all seasonscan't stop at one seasonenjoyableLOVED ITBarbara
2,Not so good one.,"I don't think this song is as much good as songs like ""The flowers of Guatemala"", ""Fall on me"", ""Orange crush"", etc. There is no good melody in it."
2,Freestyle heaven vol. 4,first of all cd is awesome but can't be rip it to computer to put on mp3 or ipod because of copy protected. i can't put on computer to transfer to mp3 player. kind of ridicious to do that because the four other compilations don't do that they allow you to rip them to computer.freestyle heaven volume 1-3.volume 5 does rip on the computer and was produce after volume 4nice going SPG music Records that was smart on your part.
5,"Great Battery, Great Price, Fast Service","Great price on the phone battery, it worked great, and I got it very quickly."
1,Cheated out of a new battery,"I ordered this battery (supposedly a brand new battery) because the life of the one in my phone was not very long. When I got it from this particular company thru Amazon, it had scratches on the terminals and I could tell it was a used battery. I was not very happy. It was only 3 dollars or so, so I didn't even bother sending it back. It would've cost more to ship than the battery was worth. Not a good experience."
3,Nice but not realistic,This would be a great jersey to have but it would be better if it were long sleeve since Jack Lambert never played in a short sleeve jersey. These are almost impossible to find so if you are looking for a number 58 this will have to do.
5,giant sound on tiny package,"I got mine about a month ago the first set I got were defective but i'm guessing someone purchase them ruin them and returned. Anyway went back to the store exchanged for a new set, couple them with my cheap dell and even with this lousy sound card in my lousy dell the creatures work great in fact I'm enjoying some classic rock as I type this comment, great set love them and highly recommend.By the way we all shall post our comments on any and all products we buy, I always research things I'm planning to buy and yes I make my decision based on other consumers experiences, so keep posting good or bad it's all important."
5,WOW!,The JBL Creature II Speakers are jsut about the best spekers you can get for $100.I just got them and set them up and wow i am lisin to audioslave like never before!!!
3,Perverse little flick,"Dementia is a good name for this movie. But it's worth watching just for Matt Schulze's performance as Sonny, the seriously disturbed husband of one of the two female lead characters. The two females are a mental patient and her nurse. Just when you think that sanity is returning, Sonny shows up again and we discover that these people haven't even scratched the surface of psychosis.Be warned - this movie is not for the squeamish or the innocent."
3,Guilty Pleasure,"Yep, this is one you keep in the drawer by the nightstand and you tell only a select few about. Those you know can handle it, and who will keep your secret. It is a loaded gun."
2,Alot of weeding through for the hype.,"I read about this book in several reviews and really don't see the draw. Sure, well before it's time but not a real page turner."
4,"Gimme that good, ole time sex","Excerpts from the magazine, this is a hodgepodge of sexual potpourri. Some of it is pretty dated, and beyond my cultural understanding, but much of it just good plain ole Victorian smut."
4,fun toy. great for storytelling and imaginative play,"First, I have to say I got this toy on clearance at a grocery store of all places. Paid only $10 for it. For that money, I knew I couldn't go wrong. Both my girls (15 months and 4 years) get a kick out of the toy. It is really cute -- has all the characters in the goldilocks story, so it is fun to act out the story and/or make up new/silly endings to the story. The spinning merry go round is a big attraction to the toy, too.I love that there are no batteries required. it is all kid powered (press the chimney to tip goldilocks out of bed, down the slide, into the spinning merry go round).I would recommend this toy... I would give it 4 1/2 stars if there were that option."
3,2 year old observation,"Thought my grandson would enjoy this toy-his mother did when she was his age. There is nothing wrong with the toy, my grandson just prefers more building type toys"
3,Playskool Weebles,"I bought this product as a gift for 2yr old and she loves it. Not much to it but the other weeble products are to hard to find or are over priced by e-bay,amazon sellers. I have the tree house and castle which I love more than this one. But the little girl loves it and thats all that matters."
4,A good choice,"My daughter wasn't really ready for this toy when she got it at 18 months, but now that she is two, she plays with it more and more. We recently had a friend of hers over, also two, and this is the toy they played with more than any other all day! It does annoy me a bit that the furniture doesn't fit in the house; I've seen this mentioned in reviews of other Weebles products. If I remember correctly, on the box it called the furniture ""deck furniture."" This feature makes the house portion of the toy difficult to play with, although my daughter has really enjoyed pushing the Weebles through the door."
1,Broke,"I always read the reviews for items I like (and want to continue to like) with a great amount of optimism. If someone has had a problem, I tell myself it won't happen to me. Well, despite reviews that this item required work to maintain its appearance, I bought it. What I wasn't expecting, was that when a trusted handyman lightly tapped on the knock out holes before installation to prep my new sink for my new faucet, that the corner of the sink would break off. I watched it happen and there was no excessive force used. The directions were followed and the sink just broke. I immediately checked my warranty and, of course, chips and breaks aren't covered. Since I won't be able to buy another new sink, I've had to repair the crack the best I can. Not exactly the brand new sink feeling I was going for. If you're going to buy this and need more than the one hole knocked out, practice extreme caution."
5,Buy it! You will love it!,"My kitchen has two full size sinks and they are both the blanco cafe brown. I have a beautiful brown, creme and gold granite and the blanco sinks make the counter tops rich and beautiful! Easy to keep clean! I recommend this product. I have had my sinks for 6 months and get compliments all the time from my friends.Debbie in Texas"
3,Marking/scuffing issue,The white Blanco sink marks easily compared to the darker colors I have installed in the past. Any type of metal cookware will leave a mark or scuff and while most can be scrubbed off it makes for a not so user friendly experience.
5,Love my sink,"This sink is stylish, durable and functional. The deep bowl allows us to clean large pots and pans with ease. I can't imagine ever going back to a stainless steel sink. The quality of this sink can not be beat. The price was very competitive."
5,Childhood memories!,"I used to love reading the Dorrie series when I was a little girl, so I was thrilled to be able to find a couple of copies..."
2,Bad Intonation & Spotty Interpretation,"I'm writing this review to dissuade people from buying this CD. I expected more from Seiji Ozawa and the Boston Symphony than this performance, which has horrible intonation problems and an overall uninspiring interpretation. To top it off, the movement ""Blumine,"" which Mahler threw out before publishing the symphony, is stuck right in between the 1st and 2nd movements. Its presence really disrupts the flow of the symphony. In short: try another of the many recordings available, this one is very disappointing."
1,Waste,"I purchased one of these toothbrushes from a natural food store near my house. The first day that I used it, it seemed to clean very poorly and the bristles fell out and kept showing up in my mouth later in the day. Gross. I don't recommend trying this toothbrush out."
3,Little more than newspaper clippings,"Reading this book is akin to reading the ""rural happenings"" column in every city's local paper. If you go in knowing this and want little more than a local ""bite"" with breakfast each morning - fine - this is the book for you. But don't expect to snuggle down in front of the fire with a gripping read, because that it ain't. Curiously the photographs (local folks, local produce, local folks holding local produce - you get the picture) seem oddly out of place in this book format. This is a quait compilation of clippings, no more - no less."
5,A rural way of life,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book. It was easy for me to enjoy it though because Mary Ellen Pourchat talks about people that live right in my area. She really captured the essence of day to day living in rural communities. For anyone that enjoys a quieter way of life, enjoys family and community and enjoys nature you will find this book very easy to read and relate to."
5,Song of the Loon,I couldn't put the book down. Im normally a slow reader and it takes me a while to read a book. This one I finished extremly fast. Everytime I wanted to put it down I couldn't stop thinking of what was going to happen next. GREAT BOOK...READ IT!
5,Great read that makes you think and feel.,"This is a great book that's hard to put down. It has all the elements to keep an audience interested thru to the end. Normally, my wife and I have different tastes when it comes to books but, we both enjoyed this one. This book will go up on my read again shelf...."
4,An Emotional Surprise,"I picked up this book on the recommendation of a friend. I had my doubts because I do not care for war stories.As I read, I was drawn into the lives of the characters and found myself sharing their emotions. I caught myself chuckling at the stunts the boys pulled, and angry at the injustice which befell Cole.This book affected me on several levels and I recommend it to those who like to read for meanings beneath the words.I did learn something about Vietnam, but it was the way I felt at the end of the novel that makes me remember it.Brett"
1,Its not what I thought...,"I thought it was an actual Dallas Cheerleading competition, but after I bought it and watched it, it was a documentary on three teams which were to compete against each other. Um, its boring. You don't learn anything from this and in my opinion, it makes cheerleading out to be a pathetic sport. Their coaches seemed really weak and most of the girls were spoiled brats and cry babies. I don't know. I wish I never saw it. I'm a cheer coach and it made me mad that I even watched it all the way through."
2,It broke down after a few rolls,"It started reporting error messages that the film cannot be loaded after a few rolls. The Cool Scan V scanner is of course very nice and still continue to work with the slide and 35mm adapters. The successful APX scans were very nice. I was disappointed to see it break down only after a few (about 20) rolls going through it. The latest is that one of my APX roll is stuck in it and it won't even eject it. I am planning to send it to Nikon with the roll in it and see what happens. Since it has only been a month, it is still under warranty."
2,mine jammed too,"It jammed after about 40 rolls, so I sent it back for a warranty repair and to extract the film cartridge. When it came back it jammed again on the first roll. I sent it again and now it's working (12 rolls and counting...).That said, when it works it works well, and I did some research and couldn't find a better way scan all my old APS film. So be prepared for some frustration if you decide to use this adapter."
1,Don't Even Think About It,Scanner works great with the included slide and film strip holders.I read all of the reviews about the APS adapter.I don't think I have ever had a product fail out of the box in quite a long time.The adapter arrived today from Adorama. Read the brief instructions carefully.I loaded my first roll of APS film as per instructions and after a few seconds ofgrinding and squealing and a flashing light on the scannerI got an error message telling me to turn the scanner off and restart it.I did and after a few more seconds of grinding and squealingthe flashing light was followed by the same error message.The film is still securely inside the adapter and there is no wayto open the door once things go wrong.I should have believed what I read about this product.It now has to be sent back to Nikon before I can do anything aboutreturning the product to the dealer because Nikon will have toretrieve my roll of film.
3,Great for it's intended use but reliability is poor,"For its intended use case this works very well for scanning in APS films (15, 25 and 40 exposure). I have a Coolscan V (LS-50) and use VueScan software. I scanned in quite a lot of images quite happily. Some months afterwards I had to scan in some more APS films and the adapter jammed leaving the film stuck in the adapter.The adapter is also REALLY loud when spooling and unspooling film from the cartridge. If you are in a smallish room you will not want to scan too many films in one sitting.On the whole I have been happy and may well purchase another one just because I still have APS films to scan."
1,Worked fine until it broke,"I only scanned about 15 rolls of APS before it gave up the ghost. Luckily, it has a 1 year warranty. I sent it off to Nikon for repair. The scans were for the most part fine. Oddly enough they're always rotated wrong, but that's easy enough to fix. Preview takes too long, so work off of your index prints."
3,"Works great, until it doesn't","Exactly as predicted by all the other reviews. I had mine for exactly 1 week, during which I scanned 61 rolls of APS film, all 25 exposure. Roll #62 went with the unit back to Nikon service for repair. It sounded like the gears stripped. I have to believe they built the thing with cheap plastic gears in order to be cost effective, and due to the relatively low volume of sales for such a thing, it's cheaper to repair them then to re-design. Buyer should also be aware that this thing doesn't scan the entire negative area of the APS film strip. It actually cuts off about 3mm of the width of the frame. So if your scanning an especially nice panoramic shot, you might want to get a strip holder and scan it that way, in order to get the entire negative. But when it works, there's no easier way to scan a bunch of old pics."
5,I loved this book!,"I'm a new home owner, never gardened before and had no clue what I was doing. I read this book before I started landscaping and I feel it helped a tremendous amount. It taught me everything from how to use my property survey in sketching out ideas to drawing up my garden plans to what plants to plant and why.It was a good laid out book and easy to follow with step by step guides. I felt very confident when it came time to actually doing the work after reading the book. And you know what? My yard and garden turned out better than I thought.... all because this book gave me the know how."
5,Experience the Roar,"For all you Fastway fans out there (and others for that matter), I ask you not to dismiss this album before giving it a fair chance. I realize it is much different than the other Fastway(David King) albums because the addition of keyboard/synthesizers but if you can set that aside and listen to it for what it is I think you will get more enjoyment out of it and realize what a great album it is. There are only about three songs that I am not crazy about but the rest more than make up for it.Even with the addition of keyboards, there are still some great guitar moments contained within and David King is at his peak on this album. What a huge talent with an amazing voice. I picked up this cassette back in the 80's when it came out and was a little shocked at the change in sound but it didn't take long to grow on me. I just recently picked it up again after not hearing it for 20 years and it still sounds fantastic. I love this album."
3,Fastway - 'Waiting For The Roar' (Beat Goes On) 3 1/2 stars,"Haven't heard this CD in ages. First hit the stores in 1985 as this was Fastway's third record. Maybe a bit more commercial than their first two efforts but still good. Tracks that did the most for me were ""Tired Of Your Love"", the rocking ""Little By Little"", title cut ""Waiting For The Roar"", maybe ""Girl"" and the uplifting ""Doing Just Fine"". Noticed they had a couple of new members this time around - Paul Reid on bass and Alan Conner on drums. Should've known this was an 'original' line-up that wouldn't last very long. I mean the disc is fine, just not as out-standing as their 'Trick Or Treat' or their first two."
4,EXCELENTE TRABAJO DE UNA GRAN BANDA,"Waiting for the Roar es el tercer trabajo de esta banda inglesa, el cual da un giro muy importante en cuanto a estilo y miembros de la banda, quedando solo Fast Eddie y Dave King a la voz, quien recluta a sus antiguos compañeros irlandeses para la composicion y grabacion de esta excelente obra de hard rock melodico, junto con Terry Manning en la produccion tratan de darle un sonido mas comercial a sus canciones, y una a una van cayendo excelentes temas como ""The World Waits For You"", ""Kill Me With Your Heart"", ""Tired Of Your Love"", y ""Little By little"" asi como el tema titulo, sin contar una version del ""Move Over"" de Janis Joplin para demostrar que Dave King era pieza importante del sonido de este gran grupo, que nunca tuvo el exito que que prometia, pero nos dejo unos excelentes trabajos en su carrera, sobretodo con King a la voz. Buen Hard Rock con teclados muy de la epoca en que fue grabado. A disfrutar ochenteros."
4,ONE OF HER BEST!!,"Angel of Hope by Lurlene McDaniel is a great book if you like a romantic adventure. Lurlene McDaniel has written many books but I personally think this is one of her best. This is a wonderful book. I didn't want to put it down until I was finished reading it. It is a spectacular book about a young girl, Amber, who goes to Africa because her sister Heather became very ill and couldn't go back. She meets the people that Heather talked so greatly about from her trip on the Mercy Ship. Africa isn't at all what amber thought it out to be. She stayed with Paul and Jodene as Heather did on her trip. Amber soon met Boyce Callahan he was there working on a project. They quickly became friends. But is Amber ready for what Africa has in store for her next?"
5,great,This book is about a rich girl who goes to africa or its about this girl named misty nobody likes read and you decide.
3,*_* AWsOmE NoVeL*_*,This is a very good novel. It is very interesting to read about struggles and hardship about the main character. Amber in this novel is very selfish and don't have much respect for her sister Heather. Amber need to look on her behaviour. Go buy right now. It is great novel fot those people who love to read about Humanity and love.
5,Angel of Hope,"I absolutely loved this book! I've read all of Lurlene McDaniel's novels, but this was by far one of the best. I've gone on three missions trips already, but reading Angel of Hope and its companion, Angel of Mercy, made me want to do the type of missionary work Amber and her sister did in the stories. I thought it was a truly inspiring novel, and I highly recommend it to fans of the ""need a Kleenex when you read""-type story!"
5,a beautiful story,"This book opened my eyes so much. I never knew things were that bad in the underdeveloped countries of our world, and it really showed that there are still people who care. It's so well written, and it makes you wish you were there. After reading it, I realized that being a missionary is what I want out of life. It's that powerful."
5,Wow. What a powerful book,"In McDaniel's book, ""Angel of Hope"", Heather Barlow is determined to return to Africa on a Mercy Ship. When she falls ill, her only hope lays in the hands of her younger sister, Amber. Amber, who is not as excited as Heather was, begins to fall in love with Africa, and becomes good friends with friends that Heather met on her previous trip. But, Amber encounters a problem while she is visiting a friend's family. What will become of Amber? Read this book if you enjoyed ""Angel of Mercy"". It's really heart-touching and a tear jerker."
4,interesting,"I enjoyed reading this but didn't think it was great. IMHO there are many better books to spend twenty bucks on. If you're a Gurdjieff devotee, of course, then you'll want to learn what he was like to live with day by day. I wasn't much impressed by how he comes across in this book, and after reading the book I certainly don't consider him an enlightened being. Kudos to Mr. Peters for presenting an honest and forthright portrait rather than the kind of pablum that is typically written about guru-type figures. However, considering G.'s craziness and instability, why would anyone want to live by his ideas? Well, he did have some good ideas, but, like all of us, he was inconsistent, somewhat hypocritical, and sometimes off his rocker. It makes interesting reading and is honestly written but Peters was limited by the limitations of his subject."
3,Well Written But Too Subtle Sounding,"This is a good Toto album, it just isn't full of energy. The songs are well-written and produced, but the whole album is too subtle and radio friendly. ""I'll Be Over You"" is a great song and is one of my favorites. Steve Lukather does a great job with the vocals. ""Fahrenheit"" sports some interesting keyboard work, and ""Don't Stop Me Know"" is a great instrumental. All in all a good album, just a little too safe sounding."
5,"NEVER GONE, NOT FORGOTTEN...","I listened to Toto's Farenheit album when it was first released, and continue to rock to this consistent, heartfelt album to this day. It's excellent, give it a listen if you haven't -- it's as fresh today as any artist getting airplay..."
3,Pop Rock Approach Doesn't Fit For Them,"During 80s pop rock album which sounds as if all tracks can become hits were sort of fad among hard rock artists. Some are successful such as Survivor's Vital Signs or Starship's Knee Deep In A Hoopla. But as far as Toto this is killing the very aspect of what Toto is. Although Fehrenheit is marked with excellent tracks such as I'll Be Over You, Could This Be Love, Till The End or Lea, as Toto I do not think they are showing what they are truly worth.Grumbling aside if you are just pop rock collectors who likes Outfield's Play Deep, A ha's Hunting High And Low, Nelson's After The Rain it is a must for your collection because it is the most pop album of Toto I have ever heard so far."
4,MERCURY RISING -- GOOD TOTO EFFORT,"FAHRENHEIT is actually a good companion piece to Toto's smash album TOTO IV. Although a little more laid back than IV, FAHRENHEIT assumes the overall ""feel"" in its jazzy, mid-tempo ambience. New lead singer Joseph Williams handles his vocals well, though I still tend to favor Steve Lukather and David Paich a little more.The album's biggest hit, I'LL BE OVER YOU, is the highlight, a smooth, well-constructed ballad featuring background vocals by Michael McDonald. Also noteworthy: TILL THE END, WE CAN MAKE IT TONIGHT, CAN'T STAND IT ANY LONGER...in fact, there's no weak tracks in this collection. The instrumental DON'T STOP ME NOW has the added bonus of legendary jazz superstar Miles Davis lending his expert musicianship.There's no denying TOTO is more than just a studio band..they are superior and talented players."
4,Toto Fahreheit MP3 Album,"This is a great Toto album. From top to bottom quality stories people can relate too. Quality instrument playing. This band has worked with quality other acts in studio. M. Jackson I understand used them to record the Thriller Album.They worked with Michael McDonald as well, this is a keeper that as not been kept in some music stores. Toto is a band like Night Ranger, Journey, and Chicago who put out quality honest stories with quality instrumentals. Enjoy real music with quality talent Toto 4 is also quality songs like Africa and Roseanna are fantastic."
5,"We,re not in Kansas anymore Toto","Toto's musical fame was too short lived for me. They got alot of exposure from MTV, when albums were still selling. But alot of their terriffic music never got played. I realized I missed their sound. So I did a search on Amazon. Well I found what I was looking for. Great CD, alone or combine on playlist with Billy Ocean, Sade, Cars, and alike.Dave"
3,Return to form...,"Released: Aug 1986 Produced by: TotoReturn to form enabled by gritty vocal debut of Joseph Williams (son of composer John), fine band arranging /production, and solid material. Mid-80's slick in places (particularly drum-machine heavy title track), while bordering overtly commercial (""Can This Be Love, ""I'll Be Over You,"" -- Billboard #11), but effective set vast improvement over previous release. Opener ""Till The End"" mimics Michael Jackson (after all, it was 1986), but Williams takes immediate charge and is obviously much better match than earlier replacement Frederiksen. Airy but tight Tom Knox/Greg Ladanyi mix leaves plenty of space. Paich continues mysterious vocal exile, singing lead on 1 and 1/2 tunes. Standouts: moody ""Somewhere Tonight,"" sing able ""We Can Make It Tonight"", and offbeat, beautifully haunting ""Lea"" (featuring exquisite David Sanborn sax and Don Henly support vocal). Recommended."
4,Un nouveau chanteur pour Toto !,"Démontrant une fois de plus leur versatilité musicale, Toto réalise l'album suivant avec une nouvelle voix, Joseph Williams.Fils du célèbre compositeur John Williams qui a écrit les BO des films de Spielberg.Le premier Single, "" I'll Be Over You "" atteint son point culminant à la 11 place au USA.Le groupe enregistre leur premier instrumental "" Don't Stop Me Now "" : Un morceau jazz ou l'on peut noter la participation du trompettiste Miles Davis.D'autres grands artistes apportent leurs contributions : David Sanborn, Don Henley and Michael McDonald.Best : Till The End, Without your love, I'll be Over you, Somewhere Tonight.Plus d'info sur : www.totofrance.com"
2,Totally not happy with it!!!,"This can only be a reference book, flip it over once and you'll get bored. Also, don't expect to find good pictures. I bought it at it's original cost, it's not even worth at that cost."
4,Very good product!,Excellent product for the price. I use it for Vinyl Printing and it's a great asset to my business!
3,"Delivers, albeit only partly, on promise.","The book does contain a lot of valuable information on plant species with ability to clean toxins, but it is very clearly an adaptation of an earlier paper on the subject by the author (available in the public domain) and contains hardly any new information. There is zero quantification of hard benefits of some plans -- eg, volume of air cleaned. Comparisons between plants are limited to ""points"" for ease of care and air scrubbing properties, with no data to back up the scores.In addition, the focus of the book is on cleaning toxins from the air -- a worthy goal, but I believe that the book would benefit from information on actual ""fresh air"" production during day and night. I live in a neighborhood with few trees and hoped to increase the oxygen in the air with household plants, but this book left me completely unable to achieve that, despite the claims in the description. In the end I rate the book 2/5 because it does not deliver on its premise."
4,Who knew?!!,My sister got this for me as a birthday gift and boy am I glad she did! I actually enjoyed reading the background research and was surprised some of the data is decades old and yet most of us know nothing about the science behind the concept that plants are good for indoor environments. I liked the detailed info on each of the 50 listed plants...esp which ones release oxygen at night and are therefore better for bedrooms. Now I just need another one that lists more than 50 ;-)
4,plants with oxygen,Love the fact that this book has nice big pictures and explainseverything about the plant.Have many plant books (from different states lived in) and this one isvery easy to read and understand and I love the pictures.
3,curious collection,"DEMOS AND LOST ALBUMS is a curious release that is essential only to the most ardent Toddophiles. The first disc is comprised solely of demos by Todd and/or Utopia. Few of these demos sound significantly different from the officially released versions. However, there is a great remake of DON'T TIE MY HANDS. The demo for ONE WORLD pales in comparison to the official version. Overall, this is great stuff, but you've pretty much heard it all before.The second disc consists of an M. Frog Labat solo album and an unreleased - mostly instumental - Utopia album. Rundgren apparently wrote, produced, and played guitar on the Labat disc. I have no idea why it was released. I read on a Japanese site that Todd was puzzled by its inclusion. It is not very listenable. There are a few cool guitar licks. The DISCO JETS cd is pretty cool. Imagine the second side of INITIATION crossed with Ultralounge and you get the idea. They do a nifty version of the Star Trek theme."
3,Tragic Romance?,"Two immature, irresponsible people prop one another up & support each other in their bad choices. Yes, it's tragic, but it's not very romantic.The biggest tragedy is that Pamela remains something of a cypher, known only through her relationship with Jim Morrison & seeming to live only by reacting to his behaviour.The impressive thing about this book is the trouble the author has taken to verify what she writes - very little is claimed without the context being noted, a refreshing change in the area of Morrison biography.Probably we'll never know the real Pamela, but I'm sure the author's thoroughness & scrupulous research means that this is as close as we'll get. You can't help wishing Pam & Jim had never met, but it's great to read a book where her character isn't comprehensively smeared. After all, if she was the amoral, vicious woman portrayed in some books, what did the annoying but wonderfully clever & talented Morrison see in her?"
1,"Avoid this one, at all costs.","A thoroughly wasted attempt to make immortal and romantic the well-known, wretched excess(es) of two people who were less in love than locked in mortal, co-dependentl psychic combat; a battle that contributed to the untimely and tragic (the only correct parallel to the tale of Juliet and her Romeo) death of both. One is left more irritated and disgusted than enlightened by any efforts to shed new light on the lives of the protaganists. Wasting the dawn, indeed."
1,another fictional tale,"People believe what they want to believe. And the author of this book, Ms. Patricia Butler, must desperately want to believe that Pamela Courson was a decent person and really loved Jim Morrison. She didn't love him - she only used him for money and security. On July 3, 1971, she watched as Jim died from her addiction. She was never married to him (common law or otherwise). They only had a marriage license application that was never filled out or turned in. Ms. Butler has no right to call her ""Mrs. Morrison"". But, when the people you write about are dead, you can do whatever you want, right? This book is very badly written and it has no literary value at all.Go read Patricia Kennealy-Morrison's book Strange Days for a real look at Jim Morrison and the woman he called wife. You'll be very glad you did."
3,new stuff,"The main points of interest here are the revelations about Jim Morrison's adult homosexual experimentation and the possible child molestation he suffered as a child that may have been the root of his extreme behavior. I thought the conclusion that he died of an asthma attack, considering the new revelations that Morrison died of a heroin overdose as revealed in Jerry Hopkins book THE LIZARD KING, ludicrous. It's like the bullfighter friend of Hemingway's I once read an interview with who said Hemingway died of an ""accident"" not suicide. That asthma is a much more acceptable cause of death than a herion overdose doesn't mean it's true. (And frankly I could care less about Pamela Courson.) But the new info and believable info here that I haven't read elsewhere is worth looking at."
5,The Truest Account thus far!,"This is the truest account of Pamela and Jim's relationship that I've read thus far! Patricia Butler did an excellent job and research, it had to be accurate otherwise Hopkins wouldn't have done the intro. I believe Butler's account of Pam and Jim more than I will EVER believe Patricia Kennealy and that farce of a Pagan Wedding she forced on Jim when he was high and drunk and thought they only did it for fun, he never once believed that he was married to Patricia Kennealy, and to tack on Morrison's name behind hers, now that's guts. I have no wish to read the tale of Patricia Kennealy... who has always talked about herself and her feelings in her writings, not caring about what Jim would have really thought. Yes I believe Pam and Jim loved each other and they were 'cosmic mates' and I hope Pam and Jim are at peace wherever they may be in the afterlife."
5,JIM AND PAM AS ROMEO AND JULIET? HMMM!,"This book is phantasticly written. For some odd reason, rollercoaster relationship between Jim and Pam has always been ignored. This wonderful book finally finally finally exposes their true yet rocky love. Butler, at last, puts Pam as one of Jim's main influences. Never before has Pam even been looked upon as anything other than ""Jim's Girlfriend"". But this book proves she was much much more. She was more than an ""ornament"" even more than his ""cosmic mate"". Along with all of those she was a strong individual. It's a shame that their lives ended so soon...a shame for us anyhow."
1,A waste of paper,"A Harlequin romance (complete with over the top prose) pretending to be biography. Poorly organized, overly sentimental, with messy if not suspicious research and unsound conclusions, this fails to present Jim and Pam's relationship as anything other than what one finds with most dysfunctional, alcoholic couples. No remarkable revelations, and neither individual comes much to life. Falls into usual trap of so many Jim Morrison bios; at the end, one wonders why anyone should care about him."
1,Been there done that ....,"The author's 6 years of research seem to have been spent picking and choosing her way through : ""No One Here Gets Out Alive "", ""Break on Through"" & ""The Lizard King"" (the latter 2 are very interesting & informative). The only 'new' information seems to be that Jim was a bed-wetter, Pamela never graduated from high school, oh and Ms. Butler has determined ( after talking to a medical professional - who NEVER saw Jim) that he didn't die of a Heroin o.d. - no, no, no, he died from an Asthmatic condition, which he had carefully hidden from his Mother, Father, Grandparents, Sister, Brother, Friends, Girlfriends, Consort , bandmates and his own personal Physician!It doesn't pass the laugh test.If this is the 'last word' on the subject, I'm afraid Jim and Pam have been paid a terrible disservice.Anyone interested in Jim Morrison's relationships would do better with ""Living and Dying with Jim Morrison"" and ""Strange Days""."
1,This book will make you dumber,"The only word that comes to mind in describing this book is joke. The wild stories and theories that Butler constructs are laughable. She goes from Jim being gay, to Jim hating the Doors, to Jim dying from an asthmatic condition that she is the first to uncover quite seemlessly. I felt ripped off in paying $20 for this piece of trash. Her sentimentality for the two ""star crossed-lovers"" is nice to read, for about five minutes. But the tediousness of the writing makes this book a bore when Jim isn't accused of being gay. If you are a Morrison fan and feel like knowing wrong information anf being aggravated, read this book. Otherwise save the money and buy a cd or Ray's book."
5,Jim Loved Pam. Pam Loved Jim.,It's that simple. These two star-crossed 'Cosmic Mates' are among the most intriguing Rock couples of those long ago 1960's. I bought this book as a Doors fan. I would have enjoyed it anyhow. Patricia Butler adds some interesting previously unknown details about Pamela and Jim Morrison-especially Pam. She mentions in the book that she had received so much information-too much to include in the book. I was left wanting more and I hope she writes another one. I have to add that I would love to see that footage of Pam and Jim cavorting in a Moroccan (if memory serves) cemetery. I wish the executors of Jim and Pamela Morrison's estates would let their fans see it. As well as other footage. One day maybe. Anyway one thing is very clear to me. Jim loved Pam. Pam loved Jim. They were meant for each other and I like to think of them together forever in the 'ether' as Ray has phrased it. Heaven I mean. Peace and Love. :)
4,Jim and Pam,I have read every book about Jim Morrison. I thought this book was interesting. I liked reading about Jim and Pam. She is only just mentioned in the other books I have read. I also liked the pictures.
4,"Beautifully told,","Well i just loved the book because i always had a curiosity- as a Jim Morrison fan- in Jim and Pam's romance.And it gave me lots of informations i would never have the opportunity to know.The photographs are marvellous ( i had never seen true photos of Pam, at least colored ones)and this book really helped to know a little more about her, although i think it leaves too much things unrevealed-like their true friend's comments about their social life.AND also i think it's not like the self-intitulated LIZARD QUEEN has written about, i think she(Patricia)just envied Pam for her whole life.She's just a person full of fantasies, because, as we all know, the only woman Jim dedicated his books of beautiful poetry was PAMELA COURSON...VIVA PAMELA!"
5,Lizard King and his Faerie Queen,"A touching book about one of the greatest rock 'n' roll couples in history. Romeo and Juliet of California, as Ray Manzarek once called them."
2,"The ""once upon a time"" version","I ordered this book because i thought it would have more information, more pictures. I saw a few pictures i have not seen but no real new information, a lot of it i had already read in someone else's book and It just didn't seem to have any....""meat"" to it, just a fairy tale-like she was trying to make Jim and Pam seem like cosmic soul mates, like they were actually born to be with each other which they clearly were not. She leaves out Pamela's drug habit with heroin, her affair with the count and many other facts along the way, I guess if you want a nice bedtime story or just see the world through rose colored sunglasses this books for you. Disappointed."
2,Author does what she criticizes,"Criticizing the treatment women usually get from authors, Krull writes, ""Traditionally, historians have talked most often about what powerful women looked like."" Unfortunately, she then proceeds to share with us that Cleopatra wore pastel robes of filmy silk, Isabella took only two baths in her life, Elizabeth was a flirt, Catherine the Great rubbed her face with an ice cube, Marie Antoinette was passionate about feathered headdresses... Each chapter, about one woman of significance in history, is broken into the main section that gives very little insight into the woman's character or why the author considers her significant; the meatiest information is in smaller type at the end of a chapter, whimsically titled ""Ever After."" The author does take care to present women from more cultures than most authors do. But overall, I was disappointed in this book."
4,Fun caricatures and other colorful illustrations.,"Not just for girls, this oversize readable volume presents an overview of the biographies of 20 remarkable women throughout history, from Cleopatra to women still living today. Listed for ""ages 8-12,"" it's up to you whether you want your 8-year-old reading the one or two questionable -- and reallay unnecessary -- passages I found referring to their more intimate proclivities. But this is an important book for kids who need to find heroes (and who doesn't) and go on to read more about them. The reading list in the back is disappointingly short -- but hey! Thank goodness for amazon.com and its incredible ""search"" program! I must admit, there were a couple of women here I knew nothing or next to nothing about. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn about them. Therefore, it's not just for kids."
3,Seriously?!,I got this toy when i was little to play with a horrible toy. Completely stiff and her wings are cheap plastic circles that always annoyed me even when I was little. Now i just display it. But TO the other REVIEWER. Why would you buy a 20 year old toy for a kid to play with seems like common sense its for collectors.
2,not so great...,"I am a big fan of fear street books, and I have about 30 at home. This book and The Dare are my two least favorites. Maybe it's just because I've been reading these for so long, but I knew who the killer was on the first couple pages. It's so obvious that it's jealousy. My favorites are Silent Night, All Night Party, Sunburn, and the New Year's Party. Go get one of those instead."
5,Pretty awesome,"Very good book!! Not very scary like some of R.L. Stine's books, but a really great plot!! ANd i was extremely surprised about who the killer was. Like all of his books, the killer is always the person you least suspect. I alwyas guess who it is, and think very carefully about my guess, but i'm ALWAYS wrong. And also, like all of his other books, something freaky happens at the end at every chapter. But this really was a great book!! I definitely recomend this to anyone who likes scary books that are very suspenseful and spooky, but not very gory."
5,Best story ever,Just best story ever that's all I can say so scary and even made me scared and I've only Reid a few pgs and I love it this book deserves a 5 star rating :)
3,Meh,"Selena has landed the lead in the school play and her popularity is sky high. Then she receives a present with a trhreatening content, and accidents start happening on the set. Some one doesn't like Selena very much.I didn't like this one very much.The protagonist is so conceited and doesn't see how she treats her friends. I simply couldn't root for this character.As I finished the book, I almost felt ready to cheer for the purpetrator!The plot is fairly good, though by no means among the best Fear Street books."
5,A Wonderful Book,"This is one of the best Fear Street books I have read. The main story is Selene Goodrich becoming popular at Shadyside High because of her acting career. Everyone adores her, everyone supports her. Then Selena starts getting mysterious notes from ""The Sun"" who claims to be her secret admirer. Selena takes all this as joke but then, bad things start to happen. Alison, Selena's understudy is injured after a cabinet is thrown on her. Selena also gets a dead mouse in front of her house with another note from The Sun, a speeding car nearly kills her. Then, someone else is murdered. Selena knows the Sun is responsible but who is the Sun? Could it be Danny Morris, that guy who Selena just broke up with or could it be Eddy, the new guy in town? Or is it someone else?This book was a pageturner. In two hours, I was finished with this book. I was really surprised when Selena found out who the killer was. The book provided a good murder scene and the killer was also smart."
5,GREAT,This was a great book. Yet... some stuff I expected [i knew who it was all along] that just may be because i'v read sooo many of his books. I highly recomened his seres 'The babysitter' one of his best.Hit and Run
4,"Good reading, very suspenseful.","On the top 20 of Stine's work. I was surprised at who Selena's ""secret admirer"" was. I wanted to figure it out before I finished the book. To be honest, I never even suspected this person."
2,not a fun read,"Although some might enjoy this book, I just couldn't. After about the first 3 chapters, I simply quit and put the book in the give away pile. In some instances, he is somewhat like Terry Pratchett,but doesn't even come close. There are the Guards (police) in a medieval type city, along with dwarfs, elves, trolls, etc. The detective guards must solve an apparent murder of a national hero who was presumably getting ready to go off on a ""quest"" with his coterie. I was really looking forward to enjoying this book, but it just becaue too boring."
3,"Mostly boppy pop. Easy, fun listening","Surf and mull and sex and fun sums this cd up. I think they've had too much of all of the above. An oldy that I'll still drag out of the collection to relive the era. (Surfing on the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia). Have a listen, you'll probably like it."
1,How can we order with no description?,"This looks like a potentially great deal. However, I can't find any details anywhere about exactly what the kit contains. Some only contain sideskirts, front and back end, while others include scoops, and other ground effects. How can I find out exactly what this deal is? I've never seen an add for ""full body kit"" that didn't contain these details. If they were here, I could order it. But I'm not going to play the ""lets see what shows up"" game for $500."
4,useful on a keychain,"I like the adjustable settings and the ability to replace the battery. I bought two more for gifts, one to a friend who needs it for opening doors."
5,MICROLIGHT,THE LIGHT IS SMALL FOR CARRYING ON MY KEY CHAIN. IT GIVES SUFFICIENT LIGHT WHEN NEEDED TOFIND SOMETHING. i APPRECIATE THE PRODUCT AND FAST DELIVERY.
4,"So, So, SO 70's - but that's the coolest part!","This one's got that whole late 70's/early 80's cringe inducing wardrobe vibe, and quite possibly the all-time worst of the many Shatner toupees. Still, it's an absorbing little melodrama, and if all you've ever seen William Shatner do is sexy-cool Captain Kirk or quirky-cool Denny Crane, this will be a revelation for you. Here he plays a sad-sack everyman; a typical suburban middle class loser: and very well, too."
3,Shatner and Shepperd Were Cute!,"William SHatner and Cybil Sheppard in this made-for-tv movie were somewhat dynamic even if the story was simple and somewhat trite.Popular topics in the late 70's and early 80's were divorces and extra marital affairs.However - the dynamic of Michelle Phillips and Cybil Sheepard once they each find out about William Shatners (Captina Kirk) extra 'activities' is melodramatic - in the best sort of way - to watch.Very period clothing and hairstyles and basic story, the movie is defiantely one look at how we used to think of infidelity.I enjoyed it for what it was. 3-26-09"
2,"As a drama, rather weak ...","Actually this movie feels like it was sponsored by some Government agency or a Church organization. All the characters act ""by the book"", so to speak. The male lead is too naive and too guilt ridden to be in any way entertaining. The message that might be of some interest is that sexual attraction is often triggered not by a specific person but by circumstances or specific settinge (but that's hardly news, I guess). Unfortunately, that alone does not make a good story. The fact that the wife on whom the main character cheats is by far the most attractive female in the whole movie does not help either."

2,Avid Neopets Player,"I learned the complete basics to surviving in the Neopian world by just using the help of other players. Many have created their own websites with help, cheats, and many other things to help newbies out. I suggest trying that out before actually buying this book."
1,Why?,"Why buy a book when instead you can go online, then to the chat. In the proper chat ask any question you need to know about neopets. So instead of spending money on a book which is not produced by neopets, you can get all your questions answered free just go to chat."
1,don't waist your money,There are tons of (daily updated) help sites out there that are for beginners and experts and best of all it's FREE! Why pay money for a book when you can get all the information and help you need for free right online? :P
1,big fat liar,"yo, gp stop lying. the book isnt even out yet! how can u say its helpful if its not out yet. and by the time its out, half the stuff in it will change. books like these are a waste of money, because the info is always changing"
4,An Unofficial Review for an Unofficial Guide.,"Many of my fellow reviewers have excellent points...It is true, all of the resources you could possibly need for ""success"" on Neopets can be found on countless fan-sites, magazines, and even on the Neopets site itself.However, what you will find in Bill Gill's guide is a very neatly-collected version. No longer will you need to bookmark numerous pages, constantly having to flip between webpages. And, in all truth, that isnt a problem for some of us. But for others, with more sluggish computers, it is inevitably a /pain/.-An asset to Neopians? Absolutely.-An interesting take on several different aspects of the game? Most definitely!-Could you find the information in the book by web-surfing? Yes.But all in all, this guide can be a great help to countless fans of the Neopets world."
2,Okay,This is a good book when it comes to getting help for neopets. But the book doesn't really impress me.
1,NO!,"THIS WOULD BE A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY(NO OFFENSE TO THE WRITER)(...) ASK FOR HELP ON THE VERY NEOPETS SITE INSTEAD OF THROWING AWAY YOUR MONEY.AND BESIDES, IF YOU JUST TRY TO FIND OUT ON YOUR OWN, IT WOULD SAVE YOU TIME & MONEY.:)"
3,"Good read, but it does not make your Miata faster","The ""Performance Handbook"" seems to be a little light on performance. A very good read for those of us who love the little cars, but it is more of an illustrated history than a ""Performance Handbook.""The book does offer a good history on the car, from the first thoughts of bringing the roadster back to The U.S., but don't go fetch the tool box. You'll not need it.If you want to get your hands dirty and make your car zip around better, try Keith Tanner's ""Miata MX-5 Performance Projects.""Then get the tools out."
2,Total Waste of Money,Norman Garrett was the publisher of Miata Magazine from 1990 until 1998(9). In that time a lot of articles were written about how to do performance upgrades on the Miata. Most of these articles were not written by Mr. Garrett. Norman simply rehashed these into this book. Most of the modifications that he gives great reviews to in the book (and previously in Miata Magazine) he has some vested interest in. There is nothing new in this book. I bought it. Wasted money.
5,Buy this book before you buy that Miata!,A must read for anybody wanting to buy a Miata and a must before modifying your Miata.
3,Mazda Miata: Performance Handbook,Would recomend to any Miata enthusist. Lots of practical information to help make your Car perform to its potential.
5,A Gem,"This is one of the most helpful volumes on prayer I have ever encountered. It was written some decades ago with the purpose of giving direction to those who are not novices to the prayer life, but who could use some counsel from one further along the way. How delightful it has been re-released. Don't let the uninspiring title throw you off; this book is a gem."
3,It's a very smoothing disc.,"I like this album, it's a mixture of music and songs.You should take a try on this album. Especially track 3 by S.E.N.S, track 4 Sissel/Summer Snow & track 10 by a talented lady, Lisa Ono.This album will ease you after a hard & stressful day."
5,No Time Like the Present!,I purchased this book straight from the publisher the moment I could because I knew the author (I even got it signed by her). I LOVE this book so much I couldn't stop reading it once I started. If you love time travel (and looking for references to the Back to the Future movie trilogy) you will love this book!
1,"Nice Recital, Poor Sound Quality","Pavarotti sings a piano-accompanied recital in Barcelona (1989) before an enthusiastic audience. It's a very nice program of his usual recital repertoire (arias and songs). He seems to have been in fine voice for the occasion. I wish I could have been there to hear it, because I certainly CAN'T hear it properly by playing this DVD. The entire sound track seems to have been modulated by an extraneous signal, so that every note is accompanied by combination tones which are not part of the music. The voice is afflicted less than the piano, which often sounds as though John Cage had ""prepared"" it. The DVD is branded ""Q"" Records and ""Atlantic."" I am not familiar with these brands, and probably will not get more familiar if this is a representative sample of their production quality. A note on the jacket states that this recital is also available on CD. I presume that the CD sounds better than the DVD!"
5,I LOVE this CD!,"Any fan of power pop will adore this CD. But be forewarned, these songs will get so stuck in your head, you'll go crazy!"
5,Stabilizers-Tyranny,"I have loved this album since the first time I heard One simple thing. I have a slightly worn tape and an old scratchy LP. This needs to be reissued on a cd. This music has never gotten old or tired for me.I was able to save it to minidisc but I really want a new clean copy. It's a shame that alot of real talent has gotten overlooked, the Stabilizers fall into that catagory, They were great! That's just my opinion and I'm sticken to it! Listen and enjoy."
4,"Any more synthetic, and they'd be plastic","I'm not sure if you can qualify The Stabilizers as ""a band"" since they only had two members. Released in 1986, ""Tyranny"" was your typical pop album with 10 songs running in less than 40 minutes. The band was dominated by Rich Nevens on guitar and keyboard, and Dave Christenson, vocals. Other musicians were contracted as needed. If memory serves, they were from Minneapolis, during Prince's heyday. Typical pop of the time, the vocals are front-loaded and the keyboards dominated. Still, the production was very tight and vocals sounded great. Don't misunderstand me--this is a good (if unknown) 80s album. If you can find it, you should check it out. You can always sell it back if you don't like it. ;)"

1,It isn't much,"Well, it isn't a Franklin product.The problem with Lingo Euro 6 is its inability to identify a conjugated verb and then give you the infinitive. Another huge downside is that it doesn't conjugate verbs and has a much smaller vocabulary than the advertisment would have you believe.As far as a tool to pick up the occasional word, it's fine. However, if you are studying any of those languages in-depth, you would be better off buying a 6 dollar dictionary."
4,Tasty but Broken,"These crackers are very tasty, as well as healthy. Unfortunately, UPS can't deliver anything without kicking it around a bit, and every box was full of mostly broken crackers. Too bad, I might have given it five stars if they'd arrived in good condition."
4,"Delicious, but very few whole crackers","Love these crackers, and since Whole Foods Markets has discontinued the product we are happy to find them here. However,when we used to buy cases from Whole Foods, there were rarely many broken crackers in each box. Now we're lucky if we find a box where even half of the crackers are whole. Great product, quick shipping and service, but they don't arrive in good shape. Perhaps a better, gentler shipper or better packing, marked FRAGILE???Still, since it's so hard to find a really delicious 100% whole wheat cracker I'll keep buying them."
2,Love the crackers -- most were broken,Over half the crackers in all six boxes were broken. I want to spread different things on these crackers and can't with pieces. I love the crackers though. I'll just have find somewhere to buy them where the breakage isn't so severe. I hope such a place exist. I dislike feeling ripped-off.
1,I really don't like this item,"I've used many types of fillers in my 2 years of schooling. This item is by far, THE WORST! It gums up the sandpaper constantly and makes it almost impossible to sand, even with 80 grit. I don't know if it's the evercoat brand or just this item; but this one is really poor. I strongly suggest looking at another brand for a flex putty."
1,"Tried this in lieu of other brands, hated it!!!","I tried this in lieu of other brands. In the past I used Kustom Poly Glaze Finishing Putty, also sold on Amazon. I used the Kustom once before on my Manx VW Beach Buggy. It worked awesome until I ran out. While ordering another tube of it, I also ordered this product since it said ""Fiberglass Evercoat"". Well, the Kustom dries faster and is harder and not sticky than this stuff. This stuff drys slower and leaves a sticky residue on your mixing board and the Filler Spreader. I would never buy this product again and it costs more than the Kustom that I truely reccomend. I am not a pro body guy, let alone fiberglass guy, just have a hobby of fixing up old cars."
3,wooowooo,"just bought this album last week. its alright. got some fun stuff in it, but most of it sounds the same. noisey punk rock. reminds me of some of my old bands."
5,Outstanding acting,"Don't get hung up on the content of this movie. It is dark and somewhat depressing, but you will never see better acting. Sean Penn and Kevin Spacey are simply amazing. The whole cast is very good. Hurly Burly is worth seeing just to see Penn and Spacey in their prime. These two actors are superb in this movie. The dialogue is terrific, but you must pay close attention to fully appreciate it. At times, the movie is very amusing. At times, the characters are cruel, crude, disgusting, unlikeble and ultimately pathetic. But the dialogue and the acting are always, always brilliant. If you want to truly appreciate this movie, don't set yourself up judge the characters. You are not meant to 'like' them, and you won't. But, wow! To see Sean Penn and Kevin Spacey at their very finest is an experience you should not miss."
3,"Too much talk, but has a good point","I was a bit overwhelmed by all this talk in this movie... However, I thought it has a good point that everyone is self-centered lonely creature. Things that are meaningfull to you doesn't mean s#$% to others. In most cases in our life, friendship is composed of thin lines between greed, loneliness, and importance of oneself. If you think about things a lot, then you'll understand where these people are coming from and you'll enjoy watching it. Onece is enough though."
1,Death is preferable.........,"to watching this waste of celluloid. All I could think while watching Hurlyburly was how much I'd rather be dead. It's hard to say which performance ranks as the most tedious but it's definitely a toss-up between Meg Ryan and Kevin Spacey. Listening to the characters ramble on about nothing was boring, trite and worst of all just plain irritating. SKIP THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS!"
2,Really bad movie,"As one of Kevin Spacey's biggest fans, I have to say his performace is the only bright spot in this otherwise bland and utterly pointless movie. If someone wanted to do a movie about life in Hollywood Hills, why not make a movie with a PLOT? The performances were all good (although I have to say I did not like Robin Wright--she was good in The Princess Bride and Forrest Gump, but not in this), but the movie is bad. It's really not worth the two hours it takes to watch."
2,not to my liking,"I had waited months to see this movie, after reading raving reviews. Finally I saw it to my great disappointment. It's pseudo-intellectual, pesudo-artsy, although it may carry non-pseudo meanings for others. What did I miss? There was no real depth in this story and no real-life characters, just a bunch of burnt-out, spoiled, incoherent people. There was no balance and emphasis between the various themes, nothing carried the drama through the end, to me it was just a discredit to the otherwise terrific actors. Sometimes, the actors you think would have good chemistry in a movie just simply don't."
2,if you want to waste money then rent this,This movie to me made no sense but I give it two stars because some of the actors i like were in it.I had to ask anyone if they have seen the movie so i could understand what it was about because I couldn't tell.I dont know what movie to compare it to because this is probably the first movie i've seen that had everything in a movie that wouldn't make sense.
1,A Pretentious Boring Mess,This is the kind of movie that is best forgotten. The dialogue is reminiscent of coffee shop diatribes by overstimulated upper middle class misanthropes. Avoid this movie! Back away from this movie! No No No!
2,"Good acting, lousy movie","I agree with most here that the acting is amazing for this flick (Penn and Spacey are great, Palminteri is good, Meg Ryan is forgettable). However, after about 1/2 hour, the movie becomes unwatchable because the dialogue (with the exception of 1 or 2 scenes) is annoying, meaningless and ultimately painful to listen to. The actors all speak in paragraphs, and they don't speak like normal people would. It all becomes a boring, pointless exercise in overanalytical crap. And in the end, you don't walk with any sense of just what it was that the writer was trying to say, other than the fact that people are basically pathetic."
1,"Uh huh, it must be art.","An ""ensemble cast"" wasting 126 minutes snorting coke and babbling incoherently. Boring losers in a story without grit. Occassionally it feels like something's almost there, but it never quite solidifies.Watch the first fifteen minutes, then fast forward to the end. A movie you won't feel obliged to pause when you leave the room."
1,If you like wasting time,"You'll love this. I sat in amazement and watched about one-half of this rambling mess about people who were so vulgar and pointless that I could not understand why major stars agreed to do this. When Chazz Palminteri smashes his head into Anna Paquin's forehead, I lost it.If you enjoy watching a ""movie"" about people who have diarrhea of the mouth and spend their pointless lives snorting coke, screwing, bitching, complaining, snorting more coke, talking about drugs and bitches, snorting more coke and commenting about every single thing they've just said, you'll have a grand old time. If you want to be entertained, moved, enlightened or challenged, you'd be better off sitting in a lotus position and chanting your own mantra."
3,"Okay film, rotten transfer","I have said it before, but I could watch a film in which Anna Paquin reads the phone book for ninety minutes. And while Hurlyburly is marginally more interesting than that, the transfer provided on New Line's single-sided, single-layer edition of the film lets the side down very badly. The film is mildly interesting at best, given that it is about watching four grown men act like self-destructive twelve year olds, but when half of the backgrounds are showing severe posterisation and/or macro-blocking, something is really, really wrong. If you own a CRT-based television that is eighty centimetres from corner to corner like I used to (preferably less), then you may be able to withstand the transfer in spite of this problem. If you own a 106 centimetre plasma TV like I do now, then run, don't walk, from this DVD. Your eyes will thank you later. I only still own it because at least Anna Paquin is in focus throughout her brief scenes."
1,PoorlyBurly,"Ok first off dont even waste your time watching a movie thatmakes no sense.Two of my friends and I watched this movie and we areguessing the plot of the movie is people that like to do drugs,people that like to fuss alot,people that like to have sex,and a guy who likes to hit people.This movie was pointless i didn't even understand what the heck this was about.One minute a guy if fussing with his friend the next minute he is laughing with him doing drugs then the next minute he is having sex and then a guy comes in the house and tells everyone he hit somebody.Come on what the heck is up with this movie?!?!? I wouldn't even give it half a star but it looks like i had to give it one star."
4,Pioneer DEH-1600 - Radio / CD player - Full-DIN - in-dash - 50 Watts x 4,Sound quality is great and installation is easy.wish it was easier to plug in my iPod but nothing an FM transmitter couldn't fix
3,Excellent thermometer of the breadth of simulation,"This is an excellent overview of all of the areas where simulation and virtual reality are penetrating our culture. The authors of each chapter focus on entertainment and defense. Though I read the book searching for background material on military simulation, I was fascinated by the use of simulation technologies in entertainment. Each author presented a very different application. Many thanks to Clark Dodsworth for pulling all of this material together."
5,Seashores of Old Mexico,This is a must have for any fan of Willie and Merle. Easy listen but awesome together.
4,Smooth as silk!,"All you have to do is relax and listen to this CD. If your heart isn't touched by WITHOUT YOU BY MY SIDE and IF I COULD ONLY FLY, LOVE MAKES A FOOL OF US ALL and especially, SILVER WINGS then you aren't listening! Both Willie and Merle were at the TOP of their careers here! A winner!"
4,Seashores of Old Mexico,"I am a fan of both Merle and Willie. Willie is my favorite and the songs on this album make me wonder if the two of them actually spent time together in Mexico. I bet they did because I believe they have been friends for a long time. I especially like ""Yesterday"" and ""Why do I have to Choose."" Of course ""Seashores of Old Mexico"" sets the scene for the two ""renegade"" musicians!"
1,Ick,"Very flimsy construction. DO NOT recommend this for a professional look, or even for a serious hobbiest. It's okay if you don't expect it to last too long."
3,Need mouse skills to use this product,"I bought this as part of a package and thought this one would be the easiest for my son to use, however since he was only 2 he lacked the mouse skills needed for the games. Now that he is three he likes this game but prefer the other DK products: I Want to Read and My First Math Adventure."
2,Death to False Metal!!,"What a joke!! Manowar need to attend a Slayer concert to get a lesson on what REAL metal is!! Choirs, orchestras...gimme a break. This is about as false as it gets. Pick up the new Mastodon album instead."
3,Above the basics {alittle technical},"Very well written but alittle technical for me. I found myself read and zoning out at times. Every subject was well reserched, detailed and written. I like the detailed grow room setup. It's in my library I'm not so sure it should be in yours but then again I do not know you.Happy Growing"
3,Old but okay as long as you have another book too.,"Ed Rosenthal had a hand in this one and it looks more like Closet Cultivator than a good grow book. This book is not the best hydroponics book you can find by a long shot. It is also incomplete and there is much better information in some of the other grow books that are out there. I highly recommend The Cannabis Grow Bible by Greg Green for coverage of hydroponics systems and growing mediums. ""Marijuana Hydroponics"" is a little lite* on both of these areas. It will get you there but I have strong reserves about issuing this book a fully positive review without suggesting that you also get another book with a hydroponics section to help you along. I did like the sections on photosynthesis though."
1,Don't buy this out of date book!!!,"I was looking forward to gaining some real insights with this book. However, it is one of the most disapointing books on the subject I have read. The infomation is dated, the size of the book is pitifull. Trying to remain objective, there are a few handy formulas for detailed calculations, the rest of the information here is old news, and all available for free on the net. Ed has, in the past written some of the best and most well known material on this subject. But this book is just not worth buying. Ed Rosenthal where has your integrity gone?"
2,"old info, outdated","the information is very general growing skills, i bought this book because i thought it was gonna give some specific hydroponic knowledge."
4,growing,The book is very informative & has good instructions & it helped me see how much work is really involved. I recommend it for anyone considering growing plants using hydroponics.
2,barely useable,"While this product incorporates some good ideas, the exicution is amateurish. This product does make it easy to rotate in 30 degree increments, but it doesn't provide a stable platform, the bearing woobles. The level is first rate and easy to read. Anyone serious about panos should look elswhere."
3,"OK, but not very solid","I have been using this device for a couple of months and got some great panorama shots with it.My only reservation is due to its flex: if you put any downward pressure on the camera, the camera will tilt. This happens often while turning the device to take panorama shots. I wish they made this in metal, and eliminate the wobbliness. It can work well, but you must be very gentle when turning the camera."
5,Nay to Nay sayers,"This was the first JOA album I bought after falling in love with CaP' n Jazz last year. I hated this album when I first bought it. Now I consider it to be my favorite Joan of Arc album. Every track is so diferent it's great. I even listen to the last track if I'm able to great through the whole album uninterupted. And track 4, (""Barge"") has got to be one of the most beautiful songs to ever come out of the punk underground. Joan of Arc take sometime to get into to, jump around the albums, and watch out for the Gap, you really have to be ready for that album."
4,hmm..,"First off, this is more like 3 and a half. Second.. i had the pleasure of seeing joan of arc live, and i ended up buying this and even though i heard bad things about it, i was just so damn curious about it. they were really good live. Like anyone else says, yes the first song is good, then when the second song comes around, everyone hates this it seems like. Well yea, the song does get annoying, but it's growing on me a little, and that song (happy 1984 and 1999, i think?) was 10 x better live. It might be hard to imagine, but when i heard it live, it was really good. After that song, the next 3 or 4 songs are pretty good, but they couldve been better. After about number 7, the cd just goes downhill it seems like, the rest of it isn't too exciting. Anyway, i think this cd was worth my 10 $ i guess, but if you ever get a chance, see them live, it's a great expierence and it might change your mind about this cd."
1,horrible...,After a horrible rape scene between the main character and her stepfather I wanted to put the book down. The nerve of the author to write the heroine liked it? I was disgusted. I thought surely after that the book would take a different route NO there is another rape scene. I would NEVER read anything from this author again. Total waste of money but the worst part is I am stuck with her horrid rape scene description.
5,Such a GREAT series!!!,"This is one of my favorite Animes. I also like Sailor Moon and Princess Mononoke. I have both the first and second series in japanese with subtitles. It has a lot of fun characters. Every time a tape gets over, you will most likey want to put the next one in becuase there is always something interesting happening. Non-stop action, and something you will want to watch over and over. I love this series and all i need now is the MKR OVA series ..."
5,A long time ago in a place far far away...,"so begins the Rayearth saga! it was so cool, and the character developement was so detailed! the artwork and animation is so beautiful and every time i watch it, i see something new! Please watch this beautiful beginning to the incredible story Magic Knight Rayearth, you wont be disappointed!"
1,I was disapointed,"I heard around the web about how great this series was, so I decided to try it. I was very dissapointed in it. Everytime the went to chibi form that drove me crazy. The plot line didn't interest me. Some parts were ok. Everyone says that its better than sailor moon. I find Sailor Moon much better. Monkona is very annoying. They seem to give the main parts to Hikaru. While Umi and Fuu just ran away. They should have called ""The Hikaru Show"" Plus that Princess looked like a priss. This is just my oppinoin. If anyone has a problem with it, get over it! This anime just doesn't interest me. Its more of the ""little girl"" type. Plus the characters got very annoying after awhile."
1,Very disapointing,"I heard how great this series is, so I decided to try it. I was very disapointed in it. Most of it revolved around Hikaru while Umi and Fuu ran away. They should have called it ""The Hikaru show"" Everytime they went to chibi's that drove me crazy. The princess looked like a priss, plus they had to learn to become the magic knights. For most anime characters it comes naturally for them. A lot of people say that this is much better than Sailor Moon. I think Sailor Moon is much better. Monkona was extreamly annoying. Some parts were good. Others were just plain stupid. Plus all the characters get very annoying after awhile. This is just my opinoin."
3,I was kind of disappointed,"The animation just wasn't the same as Clamp's. I had come to enjoy their elaborate eyes and curvy detailing, and the angular animation of the anime was sort of a let down. So was the musical score, which borders on cheesy video game music. Also, the story line is different and they changed some of the way things happen, partly to lengthen the series and to try to help it move a bit smoother according to their telling of it. Don't get me wrong, I love the anime; but it's not as good as it could be. It's worth checking out, though."
2,Moebius is the only reason to buy this,"Stan lee's atrocious writing explodes all over the beautiful Pages of Moebius.Theres a reason why its been out of print for twenty years because story wise, its just a good one. It is however an awesome treat for Moebius fans out there and is some of his best work, the way he draws gallactus and silver surfer will make your eyes pop with enjoyment. The coloring here is also another treat and really brings out the work. Honestly tho, buy this for the art not the story."
4,Facing Humanity Head On,"I too was surprised at the depths of this story. The art was very enjoyable and created another level of depth to the story, it stood out from most that I was accustomed to. The lettering was slightly difficult to read at times, but also had it's merits. The theme is very reminiscent of a Rod Serling ""Twilight Zone"" story from the past."
3,Bought It For The Moebius Work,"Very nice book, but not sure why the Lee/Pollard story was included.If it was just the Moebius work, it would have been 5 stars."
4,"1/3 amazing, 2/3rds not parable","The previous reviews did great except they didn't specficially mention that this colleciton is NOT just Parable. Parable is only 1/3 of this colleciton. The rest is a ""graphic novel"" but another illustrator, and in my opinion is not up to par. The collection is worth the price due to the Moebius partnership combined with M's notes at the end along with reproductions of Moebius's Marvel posters Stan asked for. I guess the latter 2/3rds serve as a contrasting self study on why Moebius is Moebius, and everyone else is everyone else. But one has most likely already deduced that if they are reading this."
2,Credibility problem,"This is a fictional biography of Alexander Hamilton. Atherton makes it obvious that much research went into the study of Hamilton's life here, but to make her hero even more heroic she distorts what she says about Jefferson, Madison and others, trashing them when they are at odds with Hamilton. Much of the dialogue is hard to believe."
2,Dame Janet Baker is over-praised,This recording received high appraisal for Dame Janet Baker's performance. But it fidgeted me very much. Her pitch was not steady and she used too much vibrato. Listen to her vibrato with the flute then you will know how it was annoying. She like to sing pianissimo even lost the focus. I wondered if it is possible at live performance with large scale of orchestration. She mined the poem too over and changed color again and again with the meaning of each word. I like the sincerer performance such as the one given by Miss Kathleen Ferrier or Christa Ludwig.
4,Track Listing,"1. It's A Good Day - Kelly, Pat (1)2. Kingston 13 - Pinchers3. Whip Them Jah - Brown, Dennis4. Storm - Isaacs, Gregory5. Secret Admirer - Wright, George (2)6.

1,I don't recommend this cd.,"This is the first cd I've purchased that my 6 year old daughter refuses to use because it's ""so boring"". I agree with her, it's not an engaging program and I'm sorry I purchased it. Now I'm looking for another Spanish program that she will enjoy."
1,Better to try other software!,Bought for my older daughter to learn some basic Spanish words; she was disappointed with it. Going to try some other immersion software next.
3,Not so great,I bought the book because it involved Postal Inspectors. The book was not very accurate about Postal Inspectors or the Post Office and is not that involving a read. I am still only half way through it after several months.
5,FINALLY!!!,I grew up on Nick and The Adventures Of Pete & Pete was definately one of my favorites. I anxiously awaited Saturday nights for SNICK to watch all my favorite shows. This DVD has been anxiously awaited for a long time and anyone who ever loved the show should get this DVD. You should also check out this and the other DVDs in the new Rewind Collection if all you know from Nick are the new tv shows.
5,Pete and Pete Season 1,I can't believe how much I missed watching the antics of the Wrigley family. This was so much fun to watch again!
5,Takes me back to young adulthood...,"I grew up on these episodes, so I was glad when they finally came out with the series on DVD. Now that I'm 27 and look back, I see very subtle adult humor I hadn't caught when I was a child. This makes it entertaining for both kids and adults. I love the special guests too. Iggy Pop? Steve Bushimi? Nicely done."
5,SNICK me again!,"Has it really been a dozen years since I was SNICK-ing on Saturday nights? I admit this set makes me feel a bit aged, but it is so good. Older Pete, quiet and reserved, and young Pete, the rebellious wisecracker, live in Wellsville, which is like any-smalltown USA. They have wacky adventures and a great cast of friends, like young Pete's personal superhero, Artie - 'the strongest man (dramatic pause) in the world, heh-heh!' I think my favorite episode is ""Don't Tread on Pete"", but ""The nightcrawlers"" is funny too. I laugh now at how they battled school and bedtimes like it was the end of the world, but at that time I felt the exact same way. Ah, simpler times.I enjoy this DVD set a lot, it is a must-have for anyone who grew up watching Nick. One question - when is Roundhouse coming out on DVD??"
5,TV Shows Today Should Take Note!!!,"Short and simple, one of the best TV shows to grace our screens. Why is it that there aren't any shows made like this anymore? Pete & Pete was ahead of it's time and could easily have been a hit if it were to come out today on a regular network. I highly recommend this dvd set to anyone who doesn't know the show because I'm sure anybody who does know it, already bought it. NOW GIVE US SEASON 2!!!"
5,My Childhood Days,I use to love this show the adventures of Pete & Pete this was when Nickelodeon was fun to watch everyday they had my brother and me are you affraid of the dark salute your shorts hey dude and all the rest was awesome i really wish nickelodeon would put out more of there old good shows out already just because of low dvd sales dosent mean it shouldent get put out because it should anyway enjoy the adventures of Pete & Pete back when T.V was awesome the song hey sandy was a cool intro and lets not forget artie the strongest man in the world
5,love it,i bought this after feeling a little nostalgic one day. i must say it stand up to memories from the 90's and is even better then i remember. the only downside is the quality is the original standard def. from back then so dont expect blue ray quality.
4,a cool show,this was a favorit of mine i cant wait for it to come out.i wish they release you cant do that on television nowthat was a cool show.
5,Sweeet....,"This is really neat because I never saw this show and, besides, I've only seen two episodes of the show because of my obsession of downloading TV shows and movies. So, overall, YAY!"
3,Its great but it could have been betrer...,I loved this show when I was a kid and when i saw it on dvd I knew i had to buy it. My only real complaint with it is that the quality of the picture can be very lousy sometimes and you can even see lines in the picture...
3,"Great for beginners, tedious for the experienced.","I'm a SSO, and while experienced, I found this a valuable book. Others with experence may find it tedious, because it deals with the ""simple stuff"" in great detail as well, and is tedious at times. But the way points are illustrated I have found useful in my rolse of communicating security issues to others. If you're an experienced security oriented sysadmin, on't buy this book, it will irritate you. It only covers the technical aspects in detail, and, as I say, the detail seems predantic at times.This is definitely a book that you need to browse before deciding if it will be of value to you other than a 'read once'."
5,Mr. Benton brings clarity to a complex subject,"This book delivers as a comprehensive introduction to network security for the technical professional and for managers with administrative responsibility for security.The book clearly defines the internal and external risks that all internet connected networks face today, the defensive options and the associated costs."
3,Fred is Funny,Fred is funny but most of the holes for the toothpicks were small or plugged up with the gray coating. Used a drill to make them bigger and ended up chipping some of the gray.
4,different,"If you looking for something different, thats it. The only negative is, that its a little hard to get the toothpicks in. Otherwise a real fun item"
3,Remix CD Galore,"If you've heard this song, like it and like remixes too this CD is for you. The remixes aren't like the hip-hop style that are more common on remix CD singles they sound more like the remixes that were common during the late 80s and early 90s."
4,Buy IT!,I think this CD is great! I'd recomend this CD to ALL my friends and family Id get it if I were you!
1,Waste of time and money,Total waste of my time and money on this book. Very simplistic conclusions and contained information already available elsewhere. Title was also misleading. Save your money. Better read would be Data Smog.
1,"A fizz, not a bang","Agree with other posters -- all self-promotion, very little advice. Save your money."
2,Bang the Book Quickly Closed,"All reviews seem to agree with what I found, that there was little here more than stories on how their agency achieved success with such and such a product. If you came for advice on anything else, you won't find it.Since self-promotion/self-help books sell, I assume that is the only reason a publisher spent time on this."
2,More Self Boasting than anything,"Decent book, just seemed more on why the author's company is so much better. Good self-techniques on how to get your own Bang but a little too much self promotion."
1,Worthless -- Beware of 4 star rating,"I bought Bang! and was thouroughly disappotinted. Which made me wonder why the book got the 4-star rating while a lot of newer reviews were negative.Look towards the end of the reviewer list. You will find a number of glowing reviews all posted on Oct 21, 2003, mostly by a ""reader in NY."" Looks like somebody was trying to pump up the ratings.In short, this book is a lot of self-promotion and not a lot of advise, apart from needing a $5+ mil budget to hire a hot creative agency (just like the author's). What a coincidence."
1,There are better marketing books out there,"This is a quick read about happenin's at at happenin' ad agency, no more. If you are looking for books to help you better position your business, read:(1) The Green Banana Papers by Chris Coleman (ISBN 1887617027) -- a book written by an agency person also, but with real focus on positioning and messaging and good practical advice(2) The classical Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore (ISBN 0060517123) -- it has as excellent chapter on the prosess of positioning. A must-read for anyone in high-tech marketing!Both are excellent choices.If you still want to read Bang!, check it out at the library; don't waste you money and shelf space."
3,"Not Great, but Worth it for Advertising Junkies","Despite the back of the book, this is not a great book for anybody and any company. There are much better ones out there if you are looking for idea production techniques.But for someone interested in advertising (and you've already read ""Eat the Big Fish"" ""Truth Lies & Advertising"" ""Disruption"" and ""Do It Yourself Lobotomy"") then pick it up -- preferrably used.Over all of the book mentioned above, this one is a great agency self-promotion piece. I'm surprised it didn't end with a New Business contact."
1,PR operatives at work,"This book should have 2 star rating at most -- but why a 4-star average rating you ask?Sort the reviews by Least Helpful -- all the glowing review (i.e. ""Bang - Simple Genius!"") will be in this category. They all read the same too. The authors run a PR/ad agency, I think they will know how to promote their own book.In closing, stay away from this book -- you will get nothing apart from an self-congratulatory account of the authors' success."
3,Ok,"I bought this to go with the weebles collection, but my daughters ages 1,2 and 4 seemed bored, they took hansel and grettle to the weebles tree house and I think the candy house is in the toy box. cute idea though"
4,"A moving, heartwrenching album.","Although you have to watch what kind of mood you're in when you listen to this one, Exiles becomes more layered and meaningful with the passage of time. Anyone who has ever been through a divorce or a major break up will relate to this one and listen to it over and over again. Some of Dan's best songwriting."
5,Dan Fogelberg makes you feel things.,"This album can make you cry even if you've never lost a lover or even a friend. The ""reviewers"" from Nashville should perhaps listen to Dan describe his emotions when he wrote these songs, then they'd easily understand what they're missing. This album is the story of lost love, one-sided love, love that hurts and love worth living for."
5,"Stunning work, beautiful and wrenching.","If you've ever experienced a broken relationship (and who hasn't) you'll find the audio version of it on this album. Every emotion, every nuance of pain and guilt and resignation is reflected in lyrics both powerful and fragile. ""Exiles"" is that rare item, a perfect album, being neither overproduced nor underdeveloped, and being both intensely personal and entirely universal."
4,Exiles (Original Recording Remastered) by Dan Fogelberg,"Exiles (Original Recording Remastered) by Dan Fogelberg - After the title track, this albumn get down to some good music. I admit, I really like this style of music, and Dan Fogelberg does it best. Great songwriter and performer, live or in the studio. Lonely in Love and Hearts in Decline, will take you there and Our last Farewell and Hearts in Decline will tear you down. This is heartbreak work, Dan must have lost in love, alot. Still my favorite performer in many cases of his work. And his library of work is extensive. The best of those who write, perform and produce their own work. Very good music. He should be in the Rock Hall of Fame, at the top for the work he has done."
5,Fantastic,"This is by far one of Dan's best. The power and emotion emitted in these songs are incredible. It's horrible to think that he had to go through all the pain and loss of love, but we, his fans, benefited tremendously. The songs touch the heart and last forever."
5,"A Divorce Primer, The Man's Side","This CD based on the theme of a relationship that is not only over, but the aftermath, may seem tame next to Marvin Gaye's opus of Divorce, Hear, My Dear, but the emotions here are real and multi dimentional.Lonely In Love was the biggest ""hit"" off this album, but the emotional context was no less profound than the other tracks here. This song tells of the emotional warning signs that things are not going right, and yet, there also seems to be no fix either. Seeing You Again is another excellent track, and I challenge anyone who has gone through a divorce, breakup and the like, not to have a mix of emotions whenever you see the other person. What You're Doing, reaches out to the other side, but finds no one is listening.Other tracks of note include Exiles, The Way It Must Be, and Beyond The Edge.Too few men seem willing to talk about a relationship's end, luckily Mr. Fogelberg took pen to hand, and shared his story with us.Ken"
5,Exiles rocks,"I bought my first copy of Exiles when I was going through a divorce. The driving beats of the music were very angry, just as I was. It really helped me to get in touch with my feelings. That was many years ago, and I still love the music. Dan's music is timeless"
1,the worst,"hated this record. easily the worst ever from fogelberg. trite, superficial lyrics, affected vocals. kind of like a badly done air supply album."
2,Warning...Requires ArcINFO,"I was greatly disappointed to find that I was unable to do many of the exercises in the book because I don't have an ArcInfo license.I don't know how many beginners there are out there with ArcInfo, this may be a great book for you folks, but the rest of us (lowly ArcView users) are left hanging...I did find on the back of the book that it does require ArcInfo, but there is nothing on the Amazon page telling you that."
5,A good mvie about love and jealous,"It's quite interesting that if a gay movie is not shot in USA it is usually worth seeing. This movie is an example.Leonardo Sbaraglia(Nene) and Eduardo Noreiga(Angel)are quite charming. But as I see this movie is just about love and jealous, doubt and trust. It can happen to both gay lovers and straight lovers. It's about desire, possesion and give up. The pace of this movie is a bit slow, but it does not make me feel bad.I don't know if the director is a gay or not. All women characters in this movie are described as cunny and selfish. The director is a little mean to women characters in this movie. So if he is not a gay, understanding of this film will be more interesting.Worth your time and money on this movie. Go get one, at least rent one."
1,thought this movie would never end,"At the risk of oversimplifying, this was kinda like a gay version of Bonnie and Clyde. *Burnt Money* is about a gay couple involved in a botched bank robbery in Argentina in 1965. They escaped to Uruguay where their relationship unraveled and where the police caught up with them.One main problem about this movie was that it dragged on endlessly. One has some kind of mental issue going on. The other is somewhat of a sex addict or rather he seeks thrills, despite the fact he's supposed to be in hiding. And with the traditional machismo thing going on among Latino men, these two men just cannot be comfortable with each other.When things come to an end, that is, when the police trapped them, they reconnect and renew their love for each other.Overall, a disappointing film!"
1,over-rated as a sensual gay movie,"Based on the reviews, I thought this foreign, Spanish-speakingmovie was going to have more realistic, sexually-explicitgay scenes among the attractive main male characters. Insteadyou will find that all the hot sex was between the supportingactor and actress in this movie. In such movies where the actorsare supposed to be gay and involved in a steamy, amorousrelationship yet fail to show any evidence of one existing (while the straight couples are going at it like rabbits) makesyou wonder if the actors or director is a bit homophobic or afraid of what gay sexually-explicit scenes could do to themovie's ratings and/or actors' careers. Needless to say, I felta bit disheartened and misled. Hats off to Y Tu Mama Tambien forbeing [braver]!!"
1,i am sick-n-tired of sick and tired.,"why are so many ""gay"" flicks about sickos? can ANYONE answer that question? this is NOT a gay flick: it is a flick about two very strange men who have some kind of relationship with each other (if it's ""love"" it is a very strange version of it). the only intimacy is heterosexual in nature; this is a ""gay"" movie? i wonder if the two leads, especially noriega, couldn't handle doing physically intimate scenes with another man (in this flick, at any rate) -- have a felling noriega might think it would ruin his career as one of the leading heart-throbs of spain. ah, well. . . yet another disappointing portrait of ""gay"" men."
1,"genuina ""plata quemada...""","Artificiosa, boba, absurda y supuestamente ""avant-garde"", Plata quemada hace honor a su nombre. Es dinero desperdiciado de la peor manera. Sin embargo, le encantará a todos aquellos que ven ""arte"" en las vaguedades artificiosas de muchos filmes latinoamericanos como ""Y tu mamá también"". Un total desperdicio de tiempo y dinero.Silly, affected and absurd, this suppossedly ""avant-garde"" film, honors its title. Nevertheless I'm sure it'll delight the usual non-spanish speaking viewers who love ""artsy"" and vague latin-american trash films such as ""Y tu mama también"". Burnt money is just that: a total waste of money (and time)."
4,Burnt Money,I've been a fan of Eduardo Noriega and Leonardo Sbaraglia since I saw Burnt Money in April 2003. I'd never paid much attention to movies in Spanish before except for those that earned Oscars as best foreign movies. Burnt Money changed my perception about Hispanic movies. Leonardo Sbaraglia (Nene) was wonderfully successful in coveying his loving feelings toward Eduardo Noriega (Angel) in the movie. His performance was so unique and so intense compared to those of other actors who had ever played gay characters in Hollywood. This is a wonderfully new experience for me.
3,saw it years ago. wanted to see it again...,interesting but not that great. recommend watching but not buying. you may not find it in a vídeo rental store though.
3,"One Awesome story, One pretty good one,and lots of bad ones.","I agree with the other guy who said that there was only one good story. The Story that Tasslehoff Promised he Would Never, Ever Tell (which is the real name of the story) was spectacular. It captured the mystery behind the lances. Were they magical, or just steel? The ending of the story still leaves this mystery unsolved. That is excellent literature. Another is war machines. It captures the humorous aspect of gnome machinery and a gnome of many working to perfect his life quest. The rest is absolutely terrible. One other note...I expected the Vingaard Campaign to be awesome. It was terrible."
2,Wasn't as good as I remember,"I read the Dragonlance books as a child and I am now going back through them to decide which ones to keep. This book is definitely not one of the books I will keep. I agree with other reviews that Tasslehoff's story is good. It is very entertaining, but since it is only ~70 pages I can't justify keeping the book for that reason. Douglas Niles and Richard Knaak's tales are decent, but I wasn't exactly thrilled by the other stories. I remember the other Tales books being more entertaining. With all that being said if I was still a huge Dragonlance fan and I saw this book in the library or at a used book store it might be worth picking up for the few good stories."
5,"Magnificent in its ""Power"" which should be the album's title","When I first heard Jennifer Rush on cassette in 1988 and it was her ""Power of Love"" which overwhelmed me, I became 'spoiled' in my acceptance of other attempts to match her vocals. Nana Mouskouri is the only other artist who mesmerized me like Jennifer Rush - now that I have all of her CDs and have had to replace 2 due to excessive use I ask - what happened to this artist? - she is Magnificent!"
2,Great Only for The Power of Love,"My best friend made a wonderful CD for me in 1990 which included several Jennifer Rush songs. I was ""In Passionate Serious Love"" at the time and played the CD constantly--especially because it included Jennifer's famous ballad, ""The Power of Love.""Alas, I lost the CD in my travels and, my ""Love."" However I ran across Jennifer's CD, ""JENNIFER RUSH, and ordered it, hoping to be able to close my eyes and reminisce... bright blue skies of Nevada, homemade pizza, and Emily Dickinson set to music...What a bummer the CD JENNIFER RUSH was! Jarring, clashing noise, which jangled my ears and nerves from the first cut until the last, well-remembered, tearjerker song- ""The Power of Love"" which was the only tune worth listening to...Don't buy it."
5,awesome book,"this book tells how middle school children are, not how they should be. teachers could learn what is going on in a kids head to help them understand more about their students."
1,Wow...,"Wow, I can't believe this disc made it past quality control! I can't comment on the content as the DVD player won't even *detect* the disc at all when I place it in! I tried it on a friend's player and the same thing happened. I read reports that the disc does not work on most players and on some it plays, but freezes left and right. A definite pass!"
4,best of kitty dvd,"at first i read the reviews and they said that the dvd didn't work. i bought it and tried it out and it worked. it contains orchid emblem, advancer tina, and battle team lakers ex. orchid emblem is one of the best but the plot wasn't that good. it seemed to be censored too. advancer tina was kind of old but uncensored and turned out pretty good. battle team lakers is like another venus 5 but the character design is more like adv films. i enjoyed it."
3,Title deceptive,"The title is deceptive, If you looking for a book on how to Analyze this is NOT it. The book is basically games that have been analyzed. Overall its a good book on analyzed games, but again, if your buying it to learn analyses this is not it. Because of the deceptive title I can not give it 5 stars. I can say the quality of the analyzed games is 5 stars, but so if your looking for books on analyzed games you will like this one, if your looking to learn game analysis, your going to hate it."
4,The Brothers Grimm At Their Grimmest!,"Another wonder from Paradox Press! In ""The Big Book of Grimm,"" the old stories of the Brothers Grimm are brought to life. See the parts that Walt Disney left out! These fairy tales aren't for kids!"
4,An easy read,Lots of detail in a easy to read form. Well documented with cross indexed tables at the kindle version of this book.
1,I got stuck too,"Like the previous reviewer, I ordered this film, hoping to see a film with James Marsters, Amber Benson and Andy Hallett. This ain't that film. If you want a four-tape set about law enforcement, you may like it. If you want Mere Smith's movie, you're out of luck."
4,"Good brief, basic reference for self-study and use","Greetings.Just as the book describes itself, this is a brief and basic introduction to ""social Kurdish"" in the Sorany dialect.The well-organized package is very useful for getting started in the language and dialect.My only complaint, and based on my admittedly-specialized work as a community volunteer for incoming Iraqi Kurdish refugee families, is that the book's contents would be much more useful (perhaps in a revised edition or add-on supplement) by:o expanding the two-age section on a visit to the clinic to include ""new patient"" interviews and obtaining family information on medical / health historiesando adding pages of situations and Q&A relating to the reception and hosting of new arrivals, plus receiving public social services.The supporting audiocassette tapes are very helpful.Wish there were more such materials around.All best regards."
2,Nothing compared to Dance 7 or Hip-Hop 6,"I didn't like this version of Ejay. If you've tried Dance 7 or Hip-Hop 6, then you'll find that this isn't up to those standards and that it can be incredibly hard to use. House Ejay has some good samples, but the Dance 7 and Hip-Hop 6 samples are much better. They also have a much better interface, although they are difficult to use on slower computers. If you have a decent computer, I would recommend those instead."
1,terrible,"this product sucks, don't buy it. you are un-able to utilize all of the features because house ejay is screwed up."
4,pirates beware,"I was introduced to this game via a one hour free download. I didn't want to have to keep being connected to play, so I bought it. It's fun and challenging at first, but once you get the rhythm behind how to win, all those pirate battles begin to get a bit tedious."
5,Tradewinds 2,"This game is great. I've beat it, many times, and still keepp playing it. Also, the product was shipped quickly, and recieved in a matter of a few days after ordering. I emailed the company seeking information on another game (the 1st Tradewinds) and was emailed back with an answer within a couple of hours! Customer service was way above anything I expected and I will use their services whenever possible."
4,Tradewinds 2 - Great fun,"Very easy to play. The free trade mode is a little more challenging, but not so much so that it seems impossible at time. Hours of fun!"
2,Egh,Saw them at Warped 2003...thoguht they were REALLY good...Bought the Cd...wasn't so impressed...actually really dispointed but i guess this is compared to the live performance
1,Don't buy if you already have the the series on DVD,"If you already own the Kingdom Hospital series on DVD you should not buy ""Post Mortem"" and ""Making the Rounds"". The 2 DVD's are just copies of the series on 2 other DVD's. I made the mistake of buying the series and the 2 DVD's."
3,This is just strange,"Alright you must be a Stephen King fan, you must really be a fan because this series is really warped, and I mean really warped.Be warned the occult is in here, well I actually haven't seen this one yet I'm on the previous disk but I know it will be here, its not big but its there, be very careful who watches this.This is not for young people it is very strange and thing happen that shouldnt happen in a hospital and it is a little distressing.WARNING if you have had much to do with hospital or sugary, or know someone with big medical this may not be the series for you.Im a Stephen King fan trust me Ill watch it once and then get rid of it. But it does need watching, it has got me for whats happening next, and who the girl is.PS cheper to by the box collection rather then each seperatly which I did, you get the lot in the box so dont need these."
2,Another sell out,The consistent inclusion of women into what has been a male dominated arena WARFARE has made fiction with great entertainment value into just another agenda driven medium. The desire for the cross sell has compromised another great find. Warhammer 40000 at one time was a god send but with Goto Abnett and others now insisting on the feminist agenda inclusion they will go the way of Ericson and the Malazan Empire with their ridiculous premises.
3,Almost succeeds wildly,"I've always dreamed of picking up and moving to Alaska so my enjoyment of the book was partly living vicariously. There are moments where this book truly succeeds in becoming utterly absorbing and original. Quick is obviously a very good writer who can convey the environment well--even a foreign environment like the desolate outskirts of Alaska. Where the book has trouble in it's tale of a lady who leaves a non-challenging administrative job to move to Alaska and unexpectely finds herself in a field position, is that the book doesn't seem to know whether it is a soap opera or an woman/nature adventure book. It swings wildly from one to the other without committing itself enough on either. However, it was still a very enjoyable read. It just left me wishing it was twice as long so that both storylines would be better developed."
5,Great master!,"It was such a great pleasure to discover this artist!Very rare can one find so many different qualities in the same performer-both classical and jazz works are presented on the very high level of piano playing-great attitude,fantastic touch,masterful use of jazz harmony(reminded me of Bill Evans),brilliant Tatum-like passages,great power of Russian classical piano school!This pianist is the real powerhouse - both classical AND jazz!I am looking forward to hear him again!Great stuff!"
1,(...),I recently purchased this yoyo. It won't do any tricks! I can't do rock the baby or evn walk the dog! This is definetely not a good yoyo to buy. It's a waste of your time and money.
3,"Good, but limited number of example problems","Text is somewhat difficult to read compared to similar titles. Author frequently only solves problems with a ""twist"" then only offers a limited number of problems at the end of the chapter."
2,Find another book.,"After taking two classes that used this text at GMU in Fairfax, VA. My suggestion is that you find another book that provides better examples and explanations of the material and not waste your time trying to understand the terse explanations and incomplete examples provided in this text."
3,S&S C&D 4th Reveiw,"This book is good resource for this class as it has many examples and helpful Matlab coded examples. However for someone that is taking this course with no previous experience in to signals and/or system with average calculus skills, it will be very challenging. I would suggest a book that subscribes to a more basic level."
1,"very poor,worst book i have ever used","i am currently taking a course that uses this book at GMU in va. the whole class is lost. the homework is hard to do, due to lack of good examples.its hard to follow.and it requires MANY different reference books to understand the materail.our instructor feels the same way about this book as i and all the class for that matter.but it is the one the university requires so were stuck with it."
1,These authors should stay away from teaching.,"These authors really need to consider different careers. It's almost impossible to comprehend their writings. The instructor of our class told us to not even try to bother reading the text. Since I had to miss some classes due to work conditions I am now forced into reading it. Wow, it's pure sh!t."
1,I would give it a ZERO if I could,This book is one of the worst educational books I've read. There are numerous wrong answers and the formulas do not agree with the chapter summary. Poor proof reading on the author's part. This book is very mathamatical and several math tricks are required to solve the problems. This is DO NOT buy if you can help it.
2,it broke,this is the second one..the first broke...because it matches the colour on my boat I am buying it back again...pretty dumb reason ..but I already did.
3,Run Time Worth the Time,"Ok, I was stumbling around my local bookstore in search of something new. I found Run Time read the back cover and decided I would give Chris Niles a try.In total the story is about a vacation gone bad. From the word go the main character shacks up with a lovely lady he meets on the plane. From there it is all downhill. The book is bumpy in parts, but the characters are well written and likeable (even the bad guys). The ending is a little tough to swallow.There is not much information on Chris Nyles. There is something very British about this novel.If you are looking for a quick read on vacation this one is. Will check out other books by Niles and see were she takes it."
3,Hilarious - but not in a good way...,"""Dr. Frankenstein's Castle of Freaks"" starts with the single funniest opening credit in history, where BORIS LAGOSI (hmm) is billed as ""Ook The Neanderthal Man"".Then comes the actual movie. Ugggh.Enter Count Frankenstein... Hey, wait a second. Why is the movie titled Dr. if this guy's actually a count? And who is he, Dracula? Moving on. There's a few amusing bits - such as a midget accomplice and LOTS of nudity. Howeverl, there's more naked hairy women in this Euro-trash flick than ""Congo"" (and the apes in the latter film were more attractive). One of the male leads is so ridiculously tanned, we wondered if he'd been drinking the blood of virginal actresses on the set. Just a thought.Also comes with poor dubbing"
1,Want to buy some swampland in Florida?,"This book was a BIG disappointment. I was seduced by a TV show that featured the author demonstrating her technique, but when I got the book in hand, I realized it's all bark and no bite.First of all, EVERY OTHER PAGE is an illustration. (Low-quality, I might add.) So, you aren't buying a book with a lot of information, because all that space is wasted on cartoons. Second, Ms. Butler doesn't bring anything new to the table. She reiterates the standard of dog training: be kind and consistent. I agree with that, but in order to work, the actual training CANNOT be done in one hour. (If you believe that, I have some diet pills that will help you lose about 50 pounds in one weekend.)Maybe some people will find this book useful, but I don't think it covers anything thoroughly. There are a lot of other dog-training manuals out there that leave this title in the dust."
2,awful short for 21 bucks!,"Being a dog-lover, I looked forward to a solid training program to bond with my pet. Although the book contains some good information, it could easily fit in a 1 page magazine article. Please save your money."
2,overpriced,The book really has very few pointers in it. The information it gives is good just very lacking in length and situations.Over all it was not worth the price.
4,A more objective review,"Unlike the first reviewer above, I thought the purpose of these reviews was to give people an idea of what the video is like, rather than writing a completely parochial view of your musical taste - complete with advertisement. People can check the list of artists and decide for themselves if the other acts are ""truly terrible"". Most of them don't appeal to me either, but, as far as I could tell, they generally hit the right notes and didn't forget the words.The picture and stereo sound quality of the video are excellent. Note that there are no more than three songs from any one artist. Also, the following songs are included in the description but are not actually on the video: In Your Eyes, Baby Can I Hold You, Babe I'm Gonna Leave You, Gallows Pole, Paranoid Android.I hope this was actually helpful."
1,Very disappointig DVD,The Dolby Digital audio was so bad and the performances leave a lot to be desired. Do not waste your time and money.
1,response to wooden head,I haven't even watched the DVD but I would bet my life that the only wooden aspect is that guys head THE BOSS RULES I would buy a dvd of Bruce reading his shopping list!
5,"""Really Cool""","I have been a visitor to Phil's website for several years and anxiously awaited his book. It covers many of the same topics - debunking misconceptions - and in the same way... like having a knowledgeable friend sitting in the room with you discussing astronomy.But, more important than my liking it was my college art student son's reaction. He saw the book sitting on the coffee table, picked it up and began reading. After about half an hour, he put it down and remarked, ""Hey, that's really cool!""(High school and college science teachers: This would be a great resource for you and your students. It addresses astronomy, but the thought processes are universally applicable.)"
2,"Great information, horrible writing","This book is filled with great information but the writing style makes the book almost unreadable. The author consistently takes a concept that should take a paragraph to cover and spends a page or more on it without offering any additional information. Attempts at a conversational style or ""cutsie"" language fall flat.The chapter covering the Apollo 11 moon landing hoax accusations stays on task and keeps focus on the science. Other chapters will have the reader going back over what the chapter to see if the author actually answered the question that was being asked."
5,"A Glance at ""Bad Astronomy""","I have not read ""Bad Astronomy"" yet, however, I did skim through the book. It is certainly uniquue in its content, very, informative and written to appeal to a broad readership. I ordered another copy for a friend who is a science teacher."
4,Some Bad language in Bad Astronomy,"I bought this book for my 14 year-old nephew. I wanted to preview it for my 9 year-old daughter. In flipping through I did find one expletive on page 103 (opening sentence to chapter 11), but the story is funny, so I will just black it out. I think some of the chapters would lose my daughter in comprehension. I'll wait a couple of years for her copy.Here is an except from the final paragraph of chapter 8: ""Finally, in this section we'll travel back in time and space to where it all began, the Big Bang. Something about contemplating the beginning of everything twists our already tangled minds, and descriptions of the Big Bang usually confuse the issue more than unravel it. The irony of the Big Bang, I suppose, is that it is even odder than our oddest theories could possibly suppose."""
5,Great read,Great overview of common misconceptions and deliberate hoaxes in the feild of astronomy. Doesn't require any prior knowledge of astronomy and reads well to both lay and amateur astronomers alike. Great place to start to learn about our astronomical surroundings and the why's of the sky. Everything from why the moon shows the same face all the time to why the sky is blue and how we really did go to the moon. Well written and a great sense of humor. Dr. Phil Plait does an excellent job.
1,Phil Plait is on NASA's payroll,"Of course he is going to defend the moon landings to the T. NASA pays him for this, but seriously does he actually explain why NASA keeps on delaying to go to the moon? It took them ten years to do the deed and now it seems it will be another twenty. Bush challenged NASA in 2004 to go to the moon in 2010. They never made that challenge. BTW I am a Sitchin fan and dislike Plait stating that Sitchin was wrong and how is Plait qualified to interpret Sumerian plates? BTW I didn't read the book because I bet it is the same jargon that is on his bad astronomy site just on paper now.Phil Plait shows that this world is rigged."
4,Good spy tool,"This very affordable little spy tool, great to hide in your pocket. You can use this like a miniature periscope to peek around corners and over couches. Good for keeping an eye on the guy across from you on the bus or in class without visibly turning your head. Great stocking stuffer."
3,It's cheaply made but fun for kids,"For what it is, it's fine. It's cheap plastic with a mirror inside, and the kids seem to have a lot of fun with it. That's about it!"
3,"Great Illustrations, but the author missed the mark","This book has very beautiful illustrations and I like the simplicity of the text on each page, but I don't love this book.First, it doesn't really tell a story. It sets the stage for the Christmas story, describing shepherds in a field, a star, a stable, a baby, but then it ends abruptly.My other problem with the book is the page that depicts Baby Jesus with Mary and Joseph. The text reads, ""He felt the night air, his soft blanket, his mother's arms, his father's hands."" Most people who want to teach their children about the true meaning of Christmas would probably like to stop and clarify that the father of this baby is God, not the man in the picture."
4,Not just a young adult novel,"Sheree Fitch is best known for her children's books, but this book isn't just for kids. Fitch has managed to transcend the line between adult and young adult fiction with her first novel. The story of Minn helping her grandmother to save the gravesite of victims of a Nova Scotia nautical disaster is part-ghost story, part-coming of age. Though the focus is on a 13-year-old, adults and teens alike will find something to relate to in the human drama with which Minn is coping.The Gravesavers manages to be funny and sad, clever and familiar, while capturing life on the seacoast."
3,"Great movie, bad audio quality",A great classic PRC Pictures cheapie. The only drawback is the audio quality of the disc.
2,"Somewhat passable, for a grade Z effort","THE FLYING SERPENT has no aspirations of greatness. But it does have the coolly sinister George Zucco! A bargain-basement remake of another poverty row classic THE DEVIL BAT, this film passes the hour (running time: 59 minutes) serving up mild amusement. Zucco pretends to be innocent, but we all know (and so should everyone else in the movie) that he's behind the strange killings that are always preceded by the discovery of an unusual feather. Zucco's (admittedly average) performance really is the only thing that makes it worth a view.As a lover of old low budget horror films, I give this one a ""weak but fun"". I'd recommend a rent instead of a buy, though, because the DVD is not a good value for the money. The picture quality is decent but the source material's quality is not very good. There are no significant extras included. It's only an hour long. Add those facts to a too-high list price, and you're best advised to buy it only if you KNOW you must have it."
3,the flying serpent,"I ALWAYS LIKED GEORGE ZUCCO,IN THESE QUICKIE LOW BUDGET B FLIXS. HE WAS A VERY GOOD ACTOR, BUT SOMEWHAT UNDERRATED BY THE STUDIOS, I WILL BE PURCHASING MORE TITLES WITHH HIM."
4,fishbone when we thought they were just a ska band,"this is a great record from the early days of fishbone, before they broadened out to the undefinable band they are now. lots of bouncing ska, high energy beats, funny to sad lyrics."
3,Not so heavy as I had hoped,"The socks are sturdy enough, but don't feel particularly ""cottony."" I was glad to replace them with hiking socks once the weather got cold. Won't order again."
5,Great Socks.,"These are the only socks I will buy. They are so comfortable and prevent your feet from sweating. I wear them every day, all day and love Gold Toe Socks."
1,Gold Toe Women's Bermuda Plus Turn Cuff Sock,The socks won't stay up! The regular Bermuda Turn Cuff (thich is what I thought this was) is much better.
5,"Charming book, read by the author!","This is an utterly charming book on tape. It consists of a compilation of memories of Dirk Bogarde's childhood, which was spent with his younger sister and nanny in a lovely English village. The worries and concerns as well as the joys of this small boy are captured in this delightful memoir. Alas, I finished listening to the last tape on the day Dirk Bogarde died. What a lovely gift he has given us; his memories and his reading of this tape."
4,good inesment for your money,"in short sentence, it's a comfertable pair of shoe's and supportive arround the ancle, but i don't like the inner linning cause it's a polyster not real leather(your feet's will sweat later quickley speacily during hot climate)."
5,Best recording I know of these early gems,"These are two famous early works by Schoenberg, from his pre-atonal period. Like the early work of his students Berg and Webern, the style and mood are a lush late German romanticism, with some hints of the Expressionist tendencies to come. Think of a more modern and light-footed Mahler or Strauss. While it is a favorite of mine for personal reasons, Pelléas et Mélisande is a little long-winded, something Schoenberg himself later admitted. Transfigured Night, on the other hand, is one of Schoenberg's most perfect works.But none of that should prevent you from enjoying Sinopoli's conducting or the Philharmonia Orchestra's performance. Both are superb. The result as technically accomplished as other performances, but warmer in tone and more intimate in spirit. Sinopoli does a marvelous job of preserving the chamber music-like elements of these orchestral works, a feature reminiscent of Brahms."
5,great book,"I love this book gives you a mothers view of her famous sons Manfred (Red Baron) and his brother Lothar.Plus it shows how tough things got on the home front as the ""Great War progressed.Also the quality of the paper is top quality great book for students of The Great War!WW1 to novices"
4,My favorite of the Three,"Meet Sebastian. Very good looking, Very rich, and a witch. His gift is ""seeing"" and he uses his special talents to aid the police in gruesome investigations, sometimes to the point of exhaustion. Meet Mary Ellen, great legs, tough woman, and a cynic. The catalyst at a stolen baby and a large network that can get a child from one coast to the other without detection. Putting these two strong willed people together is like mixing fire and kerosene, something is bound to explode, and they do.Sebatian's meets his match when he runs into this firey woman with the sharp mind and great legs, who likes to do things her own way. But in the end she does find a need for Sebatian's giftOf the Four Donavan books, this is my favorite. I've run into many a Sebatian like men in my time and reading about one being set in his place is a fun read.It's an enjoyable read in front of a fire on a cold winters afternoon.Blessed Be."
3,Okay read.,"I read this one because the reviews were good and I had already read he first and third book of the series. I have to say, this one just didn't do it for me. It was okay, but a bit a a waste. Sebastian lacked the personalitly and wit he had in the first and third one- The third(with Anastasia & Boone) is the best one I have read so far of the four."
5,LOVE THIS SERIES,"I love this story, it is one of those love stories that you just can't put down and makes you fall in love with love all over again."
5,"Love, love, love",I have read this before along with the other two books in the series. So enjoyable everytime. Nora Roberts tells a wonderful story.
3,Not as good as I hoped,It wasn't as good as most of the Nora Robert's books I have read. Characters were not full or well thought out.
5,Nora Roberts,"I just loved this book and this series and would recomend this to any true Nora Roberts fan. Once you start to read, you will be looking for the next in the series."
3,A Personal Workshop,"This book is an adventure of the imagination. Houston gives us a design for using the imagination as a tool for personal growth. The book is a workshop for personal development. Houston provides the reader with exercises to develop four realms--sensory, psychological, mythic, and spiritual. This is not a book of concepts and theories but of practical exercises for becoming more of who you are meant to be."
4,Excellent absolute beginners video.,"I do not understand the other person's review of this video as I have brought several copies of this video & the audio has always been fine.I use them not only as gifts to other Salsa dancers but also to test whether they have an NTSC video player & TV set up.This is the cheapest ""BEST"" Salsa & Merengue video on the market.Limited number of techniques but what can you expect for the price. Would make great PRESENTS for friends who want tolearn Salsa & Merengue but do not know any moves. I enjoyed this tape & when they did their freestyle demo's I was quitehappy as you could pick up moves not taught on the tape. Well worth buying."
4,Satanic verses.,I have read a few of Bushdie books now and find him quite wordy but interesting. Can't understand all the Islamic uproar on this particular book.
3,Kinda frustrating...,"My 4 year old got this about a year ago. He plays with it once-in-a-while. I actually played with the toy the other day probably for the second or third time ever. I have to tell you, I got really frustrated with it as the balls would go completely over the toy (I don't really have a heavy hand), and if I made it in the basket, the return would get jammed. So, I watched my son play and he seemed to have fun with it, but he was disappointed that when I put the batteries in that the toy didn't keep score visually or have lights. The toy does have sound and sometimes realizes that a basket was made - don't shoot too close together or it won't recognize your second score. That's no fun, especially when your being timed!Neat idea for a toy, just could've been better."
4,"Recieved well, package good, definitely refurb","Good product, larger than it appears in pictures. Evidence of refurbishment, paint chips, etc. Nothing that interferes with performance. The digital numbers are also deceiving-they are just stickers and a red light lights up as you score. All in all, my kids love it, so I'm good."
2,"Ho hum, are we to the credits yet?","This film will appeal only to those who really enjoy B movies from the 1930's. Put out by Congress Films, this is a real low budget flick that will have you snoring by the second reel. It seems that someone has stolen one of Bulldog Drummond's wedding presents, and in the process killed a man guarding all the gifts. Bulldog (John Howard)leaves his bride-to-be to get the gift back. From here on the movie doesn't get any better. ""Bulldog Drummond's Revenge"" is a better selection in the series. Better yet, opt for Monogram Picture's ""Mr Wong, Detective"" starring Boris Karloff which is a nicer effort and actually has a tricky ending."
2,John Howard just does not make a good Bulldog,"It looks like Bulldog (John Howard) is getting married to Phyllis (Louise Campbell) and giving up the detecting racket. One of the wedding gifts is an artificial or man made diamond. Naturally this is seen by a diamond mine owner, Sir Raymond Blantyre (Matthew Boulton.) He realized his economy is in peril. The diamond and Sir Raymond go missing and there is a body left behind. It does not take long to figure how what happened. From here things get crossed and double crossed. There are explosive scenes and goofy chase scenes. Col. Neilson (John Barrymore) of Scotland Yard is after Captain Drummond for his indiscretions and only confuses things.The whole film is pretty much Drummond formula (screen play by Stuart Palmer and based on ""The Third Round"" by H.C. (Snapper) McNeile) but there is no spark among the characters or satisfaction in the chases or discoveries or conclusions."
5,Highly recommend!,"This book was a real Godsend when our kids were in their teens! It gave us many constructive ideas when we were at our wits end! It is actually a collection of short articles written by many different authors, so it's quick and easy reading with an index of subjects/problems for which you need help. If you don't want to read the whole book, you can find specific information quickly. The book was published in 1984, but teens still seem to have many of the same challenges, and parents still seem to have the same problems parenting those difficult years."
3,"""I'm Losing You"" lost me, but not a bad story...","First of all I only purchased this movie because Norman Reedus was listed on Cast. Don't bother with this if that's a reason you may want to view this movie as he appears for one very short scene as an angry, immature lover. It's otherwise a good story about a man diagnosed with Cancer, and his ""semi-dysfunctional"" family. Even though each character type was interesting, as was their way of dealing with Cancer in the family - this movie either needed just a little more time or less characters. There are some amusing scenes, some emotional (but not tear-jerking) elements; another reason not to bother with this movie is if you want to get a feeling of how it is to deal with Cancer in the family. Not one of the better movies I've seen, especially for one that has a cast of actors I usually enjoy much more."
2,A 90's cable-drama quality soap-opera mishap!,"Watch this DVD if you are into Lifetime specials.This painfully inept drama is crafted with a loosing blend of melodrama, bad jokes, overwrought plot twists, and a myriad of under-developed characters. The central issue here is this film's over-broadness; I'm Loosing You takes a stab at every possible genre. Never really allowing itself enough time to explore the possibilities within one central story with well developed characters, it sprawls out its never-ending twists and turns over the lives of at least 7 different characters, lives that somehow strangely (although predictably) manage to intertwine (much in the way Crash did in 2004). The minute we become attached to a character, the film jump cuts to another; it's annoying!I give this movie 2 stars (instead of 1) because it is not a complete waste of time. It can manage to entertain you when you are under the weather and are looking for something very basic."
4,A functional item that looks good and works well,"There is not too much to say about a cap, it does its intended job, looks nice and fits the mpc well."
1,"Fool me once, shame on you...","I have made many purchases at Amazon; this is the first time I was cooked. Consisting of two pipes with a spring between them, requiring no more strength than my seven year-old daughter (whom we call Gum Drop) can muster, the GripStik is a useless piece of junk. When I received it, my only thought was that the ""manufacturer"" probably was aware that they could rip people off for $20.00 because most buyers, myself included, do not have time to return their junk to get twenty bucks back. What a marketing plan... rip people off for twenty dollars and count on them having a life. Fool me once, shame on you...Brian Brookbank"
2,tention sucks,This thing is weak it takes no strength to work it and you don't even get a good workout I would say that if you have even a little bit of forearm strength to pass this thing up they call them TV gimmicks for a reason and this is a class A gimmick
5,Gripstik,"In my sport, it's a leverage game and even with my strength, I was lacking in some areas...I've encountered massive gains in my hand/grip, wrist and forearms with proper use of use of the GripStik...I just picked up my 6th World Armwrestling Champion title..Thank you Bill Collins"
1,WATCH THE WHOLE THING,"ok, granted, it's absolutely awful, the worst movie i have ever seen on any and all levels of moviemaking. HOWEVER, you really need to watch the whole thing, because it simply boggles the mind how bad this thing is. at the end, as your brain slowly melts out your ears, you'll thank me."
2,Baby Girl,"This was a very odd movie. I found myself cracking up simply because of the horrible effects and feeling sick simply because of an ""intimate"" scene between a living female and a dead male. I had to stop the film halfway through because I started to feel stupid and not to mention..dirty. I'll be generous and give this movie two stars only because it did allow me to giggle and crack up a few times just because it was so stupid. Who's redbone?"
1,GARBAGE,Worst horror film ever.Killer is stupid.Just boring.Not being racist but usually all films with all black ppl are really cheap. But!!!!the movie jacked up is amazing. Go look it up.Great story.Great acting.Incredible
4,"nice closure to this well-crafted, bizarre series..","The last chapter of the Blackwater series has the town of Perdido, Alabama all grown up and our favorite characters, both the human and humanoid, are either simply growing older or moving away ... or dying. The story wraps nicely as it began six installments earlier, with a flood. And the goblins and swamp monsters are once again reclaimed by the river. Believable? <giggles>I suppose what I like best about the Blackwater series is its fine characterizations and well-structured story. Now that I've finished the series I am sorry to see it end.Bottom line: it is beyond me why the Blackwater series is out of print. Overall a fun, creepy and absorbing piece of American folklore."
4,Michael McDowell's Blackwater series.,I read these books back in 1983. Our son had a motorcycle accident and was in the hospital. The receptionist was reading the first one and mentioned that it was a great book. I read the synopsis of it and thought I'd try it. She let me borrow her copy. I was intrigued and purchased them all as they came out. I still have them. I was discussing the books with a friend the other day and decided to check Amazon to see if perhaps they might be ready for the kindle. I am not usually a fan of the supernatural....but these books? I really liked.
4,Fasten your seat belt,"This is a fast moving, suspenseful, finale to Conan Doyle's long running series (or is it?). Like The Hound, The Final Problem combines beautiful scenery (albeit the Swiss Alps instead of the English countryside)with a great story. The sequence of Moriarty and Holmes in the latter's rooms on Baker Street is unforgettable as is the climax at Reichenbach Falls. A must for any fan of this series."
5,IS THIS A JOKE?? THIS VENDOR NEEDS TO BE REMOVED,"FIRST OFF, THIS PRICE OF $300 IS A JOKE. YOU CAN BUY THIS AT TOYS R US FOR ABOUT $280 LESS. IF ALL ELSE FAILS, GO TO EBAY. BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS FROM THIS SELLER. SORRY, BUT I'M NOT ABOUT VENDORS RIPPING PEOPLE OFF ENORMOUSLY."
4,Nice toy but could be better,"My kids love to play with this toy and that is the most important thing, but I am going to give it only 4 stars because it is much smaller than I expected. My two year old has to be on his knees to play with it. Also, we took away the two prong utensil which we thought could be dangerous for little kids. As the name implies, the grill ""talks"" when you touch it and its eyes move. The kids have knocked it over many times while playing and we've had no problems with it. It seems to be well made and durable."
4,Nice Solution,"I used this on the middle of my garage to turn on a bunch of lights. It's impressive when triggered and works well.only 4 stars as it could use some more settings and has occasionally been false triggered by the sunset. I would buy it againas I could not find anything that is built this well.Nick WalshSeattle, WA."
3,"Good performance, bad recording","The orchestra sounds like it is in a 500 sq ft hall instead of a 5000 sq ft hall.It is not so much distorted as unresolved. The ""sprecher"" in the penultimate movement tries to pierce the 300 musicians in front of him without success. I also bought the Giuseppe Sinopoli version. Music clearer and with a more comprhensible ""sprachgesang"", though the actor Klaus-Maria Brandauer is a bit too frenetic. All the singers sound fine and appropriate to me."
2,The Master Diijon,"Though intended as crime drama, this offbeat offering has as much to do with horror as noir. Von Stroheim, with his sinister squint and creepily cocked fedora, seems a preternatural presence as he skulks through the story, somehow hypnotizing the hapless into uncharacteristic performance. Modern viewers may find themselves tottering toward helpless tittering as he uses flicks and flashes from a lighter to mesmerize his foils. In the mid 40's, though, such a premise probably seemed less preposterous, and von Stroheim's Prussian mien must have exuded a milieu that tweeked the xenophobic. Seen from this perspective, the film may be of interest as a sort of period piece--and, regardless, it does have Erich von Stroheim...and a noirishly nifty finale!"
4,VON STROHEIM!!!!!,"The Image DVD is a beat-up TV print, but at least it's complete and watchable. The PRC logo has been replaced by aTV logo at the beginning."
5,Great vocabulary,This book is a great vocabulary for a second language speaker. I recommend it to everybody who wants to build his/her vocabulary.
4,"Wonderful Book, But Not Enough On Its Own","This book was a lot of fun to read. The sample sentences are hilarious and the tests are pretty helpful. I went through it about ten times and made multiple lists and flash cards of the words. I highly recommend it to anyone who is prepping for the GRE or looking to expand his or her vocabulary. I would, however, not use this as my only guide for the GRE verbal. It would be best to get a complete test guide or another one that talks more about strategy."
5,Very Helpful,This book goes that extra mile that I needed. I used this book as a supplement to a Princeton Review GRE prep and found it at times better than the text book from my course. This book uses the words in context which is helpful in memorizing.
3,word smart for the gre,"The GRE exam has changed. and as a result the vocabulary section is not as important as in the past. So, if you have limited time to prepare this exam, you need to increase your practice in other areas like reading comprehension (RC),(50% of the verbal section is RC) and decrease the time that you use in learning new vocabulary. This book was published in 2007. It may be better if you buy a newer version for the new GRE."
2,Paleontology,An over priced reprint of previous material. Most of the restorations can be found in a previous book that is much more comprehensive.
4,It Simply Works,"Every negative comment made about this game is true. The graphics are subpar, even for the Wii. The missions do run together and while there are hundreds of building to go into, they basically all have one of 8 or so layouts. Every hotel and club is the same as ones on the other side of town. The Michael character is awful and the events of the movie are changed and out of order. I can't argue any of these points.Yet, the game is simply a blast. The controls are spot on, from great melee fighting to the excellent lock and aim shooting system, you will control your character better than you thought possible. Also, for an epic game, its remarkably easy to use on a casual basis. Have a few hours? Do some missions and blow up some compounds. Have a few minutes? Kill some gangsters and take over a bakery. Its all up to you.Sure, its a GTA clone, but its a good GTA clone. And for $30 you can't go wrong. Highly recommended."
4,Great fun game,"I wasnt sure at the begining about buying this game but I give it a try, and let me tell you it is a great game, it uses the wii remote in a very good way, you throw punches headbutts and even there are finishing moves, it was done very well, the game gives you 30+ hours of gameplay in gta missions styles, and they are fun. If you are looking for a more mature game, and something different, action, for the wii this is the game, I highly recomend it, the wiiremote moves and everything works just great."
3,Great for price,This game is great for the price. It is a very entertaining game that is fun to progress through. Didnt notice many flaws and was very pleased for the low cost of the game.
4,This games a Blast !,Great game of course just like any game it gets boring after hours of playing but to be honest its fun !
4,Good,Bought for my son. It became one of his instant favorites! The package arrived on time. All around good experience.
5,"Very Fun and plenty of game play...very violent, not for kids","This game is great, its very detailed, allowing you to travel to each of the five burrows of New York and deal with the five families. You can do your own thing or play the movie. Its got a lot of hours of gameplay but it is very violent. You use the wii remotes to strangle gangsters and can kill people in many different ways."
2,Typical shoot em up,"Nothing about this game really stands out other than it says Godfather on the cover. Interesting to own for the novelty i guess. personally, its taking up space in my game cabinet."
4,The Trinity Collection,I had seen these movies years ago and always wanted them for myself. Terrance Hill is a very funny actor and these movies make like of the old standard western. There are a great break from the usual.
3,Great Spaghetti Westerns,"If you're a fan of Trinity or ""spaghetti westerns"" in general, you're going to love this set. The first movie of the series, ""Boot Hill"", has the cinematic quality of a student film. However, the other two movies in the set, ""They Call Me Trinity"" and ""Trinity is Still My Name"" are great films. Absent from the set is the third of what I'd call the real trilogy, is the movie ""My name is nobody,"" which (in my opinion) isn't as good as the other two movies and isn't really missed here.The Trinity movies feature the love/hate relationship between two outlaw brothers who, despite their worst intetions, end up being the heroes of the movies.Unrealistic fight scenes and quick draws ""faster than the eye can see"" as well as impossible card tricks are comically placed throughout the series. Terence Hill plays the part of the vagrant Trinity. Bud Spencer plays his brother."
2,Poor Quality,"These have to be the poorest quality dvd's I have ever seen...Boot Hill is the worst, with Trinity is Still my name being the best quality....But for dvd's, the quality of all 3 dvd's are awful........."
4,TRINITY RIDES AGAIN!!!!,"I HAD NO IDEA THAT THE TRINITY MOVIES HAD BEEN PUT ON DISC. AS A FAN I LOVE THEM ALTHOUGH THEY ARE A BIT GRAINY IN SOME PARTS. STILL, YOU JUST CANT BEAT THE SLAPPING SCENE!!! ANYONE WHO KNOWS TRINITY WILL KNOW WHAT I MEAN."
3,They Call Me Nostolgia...,"I remembered these flicks from way back when. Shot with a very certain attitude. Whereas other so-called "" spaghetti westerns"" tried not to be overtly what they overtly were; these films delight in the campyness of their genre. As Trinity drags his gun through the dirt and rivers, you find yourself amazed that it always fires when he needs it. For primarily comedy with a little western action thrown in, you can't go wrong here. Just be careful that your tongue doesn't get shot in your cheek!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION! This is an unauthorized bootleg edition.,This is an unauthorized pan and scan release of both these films made from VHS tapes. If you want quality copies of these films buy the HEN'S TOOTH VIDEO edition. They cost more but they are authorized by the producer's estate and made from anamorphic 16x9 masters with royalties paid to the actual copyright owners of the pictures.
1,The Trinity Collection,"The movies and stories are classic westerns, the quality is horrible, these are not remastered. It looks like they found the oldest copy of the film and transfered it to DVD. If I didn't like the actual movies, I would not buy knowing the quality."
1,big trinity fan,"This was one of the worst set of DVD's I have ever purchased. Does not Amazon screen for quality picture or who supplies them with merchandise? These are like junk import copies with some of the best scenes cut. I am angry and look for an improvement! Don't but this box set, it is garbage quality. Boot hill was so dark in many parts, you might as well be looking at your tv screen with the power off with a stereo paling the sound track for sound, even at night, the blackness was real bad. Someone is duping the buyers, ""trash dvd's for your money please"" , suckers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Look for a better proven format with uncut versions."
1,terrible Quality and unjustified compilation,"Boot Hill has nothing to do with the other two ""Trinity"" movies really.Boot Hill is the last in a trilogy of Colizzi films starting with ""God forgives, I don't"" and ""Ace High"".The ""correct"" Trinity series would be (more or less): They call me Trinity and Trinity rides again. There is no such thing as a part three to that.The best Boot Hill DVD on the American market is that of Wild East, but it's not a totally uncut version.www.spaghetti-western.net"
2,For Decorative Use Only,"The Thathed Hut Bird Nest is very cute, however it is not constructed well enough to use with live birds. The webbing is not tight, creating holes that adult birds get their legs caught in and baby birds can fall through. Purchased several of these nests for our aviary and ended up removing all of them."
5,An all too rare collection,"This collection of Ed "" Doc "" Ricketts letters rates 5 stars if for nothing else the glimpse it gives into a man that is all too rare. For the non-biologist reader considering reading Ricketts book, Between Pacific Tides, The Life and Letters of Edward Ricketts is a good place to start. If any reader is interested in exploring what John Steinbeck called "" a mind without horizons"", this is a very valuable resource as well. What we find in this collection of letters is really what his friend Steinbeck saw, a man with unlimited understanding of the human condition and a man who still, almost 60 years after his death, has much to teach."
3,It's a postcard book. All pictures.,"All pictures of Janeway, Torres, Seven of Nine and a few of Kes, plus a few group shot. Photo quality is generally good; some are poster-quality clarity, others are just pics from the show, but they're all nice shots. Printed on good quality stock. I'll mail off the Sevens first and save the Janeways for special occassions."
1,still haven't received it....,I have been waiting for I don't know how long and still haven't received this item...
4,Great,This is a great quick read. I had my Girls XC team read it before the season and it really helped with getting all of them on the same page.
4,Jim Enright - author of Flagstaff Hill,"Highly recommended for cross-country runners and their coaches.As a runner I enjoyed the detailed descriptions of all the championship races. The authors gave execellent insights into the moods and outside interests that can cause chaos on any team.As a coach, the book held my interest since the writers were runners on the Salem XC team. However, more detailed descriptions of the training during the season would have made the book more interesting.As a writer, I was amazed at the quality of writing these high school authors exhibited. Excellent job! Their personal insights into the runner's feelings and moods were top notch."
4,From Adversity Can Come Victory,"Residing in Ohio, the chronicle of the travails and triumphs of the Salem High School cross-country team has extra meaning; the scoring error in the state championship meet which spoiled a solid season was a controversial issue chronicled in the sports media throughout the Buckeye State.And that is where the story could have ended, but is only the beginning. The hard work to climb the hill back to the top the following season is the compelling story from team members and cousins Paul and Joe Shivers.The story is geared to high-school readers and could be used by coaches as a teaching tool. Champions are not made simply from reaching the finish line in first place; they are shaped by adversity and never giving up.This is an inspirational story that is played every late-summer and fall out on turf courses throughout the nation."
2,Not Impressing: From a high school runner,"Personally, I found that this book wasn't very inspiring and was written quite amateurishly. The only reason I finished it was that it was given to me as gift. If you are looking for and inspiring running book I would highly recommend Bowerman and the Men of Oregon: The Story of Oregon's Legendary Coach and Nike's Cofounder."
3,"Good story, perhaps too many details","I enjoyed this story, very motivational. Those not intimately acquainted with xc running might have difficulty with some of the technical aspects of scoring meets. I personally would have preferred less of that and more on the human interest angle. It is a very creditable job considering the age of the authors."
4,Harriers,"Good read - enjoyable, quick. As a parent cross country supporter, I found it insightful to get the kids' perspectives."
3,Tweezer,"For all the hype and the cost of this product, it really doesn't perform any better that a cheap drugstore brand."
3,OK Tweezers for the $10 I paid,The slanted Tweezerman tweezers #1231-R fullfilled by Overstock Nation were not of the same quality asthe usual tweezermans I've purchased elsewhere. Not as parallel and tip is not as wide? Maybe refurbished?
1,Great Tweezer but package was empty first time,"I ordered this with other items from Amazon.The package was missing the tweezers.Phoning resulted in an immediate forwarding of the item.Now I have e-mail from Amazon, asking for a return of the ""missing"" item.Threatened to charge my American Express twice. What an idiotic system.Never again. I can get it locally, I'll do this instead next time.This is about the 15th run-in I've had from Amazon. Their service is too large, disorganisedand unfriendly."
4,Great mid-range tweezers,"I've used the cheap $1-$2 tweezers, these, and the really expensive types, and I think for the amount you pay, these are great. Sure, they're not at amazing at the diamond grip tweezers out there, but they're also a fraction of the price. My only complaint is that they seem more prone to breaking the hair rather than pulling it out than my old pair (happens one in four - five times at most), but that doesn't bother me enough to warrant spending $30 on a pair of tweezers.Overall, great value and good performance. Far better than the cheapies, better value than the expensive pairs."
3,Still searching for a great tweezer.,"My favorite tweezers bit the dust a few months ago. This one had terrific reviews on Amazon, so I bought it. I don't understand all of the enthusiasm. Most of the time, they perform okay. But sometimes they don't. Hairs break off, and sometimes they slip out. Perhaps I received a dysfunctional pair. If I'd paid $8 for them, I wouldn't be so critical. But at this price, I expected more."
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I am really into tweezing my eyebrows. I'll spend far too long trying to pull out one hair. So I really hoped these would lessen my frustration at getting out certain challenging hairs. Unfortunately, my roommate's cheaper Earth Therapeutics tweezers are still the ones I end up relying on when the Tweezerman can't do the job. For the most part they are just fine, but they certainly aren't the miracle they are purported to be (for me at least). I am definitely buying my own Earth Therapeutics, which means I'll own 3 tweezers! Yikes!"
2,disappointed,i was pleased with the mini tweezerman tweezers so i decided to get a regular version. i was disappointed to say the least. the tips on the tweezer are misaligned so the grip is poor. i was going to return it but it was too much of a hassle. keeping this in the first aid box instead.
3,"Ok, not great","They are OK, but not much more 'grippy' that old tweezers I have which I bought these to replace. I don't think they are worth the price."
3,Not for the money-,"These are supposed to be the Cadillac of tweezers, hence the higher price. However we found them to look their sharpness if you will, way too soon. The Revlon tweezers lasted much longer and for half the price."
1,Terrible Expensive Tweezers!,"I have an aging pair of Revlon tweezers I was hoping to upgrade. These were an expensive mistake. Hairs regularly break before being extracted. I have abandoned these to the back of my medicine cabinet as an emergency backup, and I'm sticking with my Revlons. I am an honest reviewer, and these tweezers were just a big waste of money."
1,Imposter!,I have been wanting to get myself a new pair of Tweezerman tweezers and love the convenience of Amazon being a new Mom. These were not the real thing! I only use Tweezerman and these were not crafted the same. They did not even work! I sent them back right away. The good thing I can say is that Amazon is awesome with returns. I was bummed these did not work out. I have since bought new ones at a beauty supply store near my home for a little more money but it's worth getting the real thing!!
2,Cheap and flimsy,"I don't know why these tweezers received such good reviews from other users. Yes, they do seem sharp but they also seem cheap and flimsy to me. They are so lightweight that the slightest pressure will close the tip before you have even managed to grab the hair. Personally, I will stick with the Revlon tweezers at half the cost."
2,Painful compared to other tweezers,"I've tried many tweezers in my life, but few make tweezing as painful as the Tweezerman brand. Sure, they work well at grasping small hairs, but I have a different brand of tweezers that works just as well and is not half as painful. I believe the problem is that the ends of the tweezers are actually sharp metal. My current tweezers is smoother at the tip, thus they do not ""scratch"" my skin. Was very disappionted at the performance of the Tweezerman brand."
5,Hands down - the best tweezers I have ever owned!,"These are seriously the best tweezers I have ever had. I bought two pairs of pink - for 2 reasons. 1 - to discourage unauthorized use by my husband for electronic/general purpose/non-beauty work, and 2 - I bought two because if he did manage to swipe the first pair, I have a backup LOL. So far, he has respected the awesomeness of these tweezers for beauty purposes and I have tweezed hairs and splinters from him with much less complaint than with my old tweezers. I definitely recommend and even told my mom that she has to grab a pair. Very satisfied!"
3,ehh..,It's pretty much all hype you guys. Don't get pulled in like I did. They're just tweezers.. and they hurt. I very much prefer my Lacrosse tweezers to these.
5,Tweezerman tweezers,Item just as described. Purchased as a christmas gift for my mother. She says they are the best tweezers! Great product.
3,GOOD FOR A WHILE....,THESE TWEEZERS WERE REALLY GOOD WHEN I FIRST GOT THEM BUT AFTER MY DAUGHTER USED THEM FOR AWHILE THEY WERENT AS GOOD....DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM ..BUT ENDED UP ORDERING SOME NEW RUBIS TWEEZERS WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER ......
5,Awesome Tweezers,These are the top of the line tweezers. They can get any hard to get eyebrow hair. I will never use a different brand of tweezers again.
5,Best Brand Out There,"I used to habitually buy a different but fairly well-known brand of tweezers. When a pair would get misaligned, I'd go and buy an identical set in the $12-$15 price range. I switched over to Tweezeman a couple of years ago and have been delighted with both the quality as well as the ease of handling and the end results.These tweezers are easy to handle and the slant tip makes it easy to grasp a hair and extract. They are well calibrated and extremely sturdy. I've had no problems with misalignment. They are easy to clean and sanitize and look exactly the way they did when new.Tweezeman offers great quality. Despite the higher price point, they are made to last a lifetime."
1,newer tweezers NOT up to par,"I have used Tweezerman for years and love them, but in the last year or so the quality has gone DOWN. I can hold the same model end to end and see the newer ones are not as finely shaped, and don't work as well. We trusted your quality. SHAME ON YOU."
5,Great Tweezers!,I wanted to know if these tweezers were good and plucked the tiniest hair. The tweezers I had before wouldn't grab the hairs very well. I have been using these tweezers for over a month and they have been great! They clean up my eye brow easily. They grab even the tiniest hairs which make it easy to pull because they have a good grip. These tweezers get everything and are the best tweezers I have ever own!
2,Expensive & Disappointing,"I have been using these tweezers for 6 months now (purchased Sep 2011) and I feel really let down after being lured into this purchase by the high ratings, especially when I paid $18. Since I don't have much good to say about these tweezers, I'll start with the cons: They don't consistently grip hairs - it takes repeated attempts to get an appropriate grip which becomes infuriating. When you do get a grip there's a good chance the hair is going to be cut in half (I would guess one out of four times). Also, the edges are entirely too sharp and makes for a great skin cutting tool. I wouldn't be writing this review if the average rating for this product was a 3 star...but at 4.5 stars, I feel like I need to share my frustrations."
2,I don't get the hype,"I've been using a pair of nationalbrand tweezers that worked great - but have unfortunately dulled after 8 months or so. I finally gave in and spent double the money on these Tweezerman tweezers thinking they'd be even better, but was instantly disappointed. They don't grip nearly as well as my previous tweezers. I don't understand the reputation or hype that goes along with Tweezerman - they don't even work."
2,very disappointed,i was expecting a much better product for the amount of money I paid. The tweezers are made of very thin material and are flimsy.
4,Great Product.,"These tweezers surely get the job done! You can tell they are much better quality than other tweezers, especially considering the price. I would definitely recommend to friends, they grab eyebrow hairs easily and pull them out flawlessly."
1,Worst Tweezerman product ever!,"May as well come from Longs. Nothing like their usual quality. It's clunky, unrefined, not sharp, and not a precision close....i.e. gaps! What are they making them in China now?"
5,Tweezer,Worth every penny. I have a ceramic one also but the ceramic one ended up losing it's sharpness. This steel one is much better.
5,Best Tweezers Ever,These tweezers are well worth the cost. They are a joy to use. I have recommended them to friends and plan to give them as gifts.
5,Tweezerman S.S. Slant,"Don't even give it another thought, just buy them. I'm a nurse and I know that working with good instruments makes a world of difference. They are sharp, so be patient. I have thin brows with roots that go to the other side of the planet, so I'm accustomed to holding consistent pressure until the little devils just give in. It's worth the time. These are precision instruments--love 'em! I've hidden these and leave free access to my old ones."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,"I needed to get my tweezerman tweezers for a while now. Since my local salon doesnt sell them anymore, she recommended amazon. GREAT price for the tweezers. Color doesnt matter to me, just as long as they function as great as always, it works for me. I suggest this product. Delivery was quick & easy."
5,Most amazing tweezer EVER!,"My hubby picked this up for me several years ago as a stocking stuffer. When my mom comes to babysit, she always uses mine because she said it works so much better than any she's ever had. So for Christmas I got this for her too and it was one of her favorite gifts!"
5,Gets every hair.,"Ladies of a certain age seem to sprout stray hairs in their chin region. This what I've been told can't speak from experience (wink). So, they need a tweezer that will yank each one on the first grab. This tweezer does just that. Sit down in front of your magnified mirror and have a grand ole' time plucking away. Works good for eyebrows too. Gentleman, don't be afraid to use this tool too for those pesky ear and top of the nose rebels."
2,IGNORE THE HYPE - DON'T DO THE JOB,"When I saw these tweezers I was really excited because I know how hard it is to find a great tweezer. I decided to try them because they had alot of positive feedback. Let me just say that they did not live up to my expectations. When I first used them, they were flat together and had very little ""spring"" which left little force to get those short, difficult hairs. The packag said you can slowly pull them apart for more resistance, but that did not change the fact that the tips are very sharp and they hurt your face without pulling out the smaller hairs. When I targeted one hair in particular, the tweezers failed to pull it out and just kinked it up, forcing me to use a different pair of tweezers to grab the imbedded hair. For the price, I was very surprised that they were not the best pair of tweezers I ever had. I would never buy these again and I suggest that others save their money."
2,Not much better than revlon,"I bought these hoping they would snag those really tiny, barely there black hairs under my eyebrows. I had a pair of slanted revlon tweezers that cost $12 and these work just as good as those. Based on the reviews I thought these would be something amazing, but I wasn't impressed"
2,"I Needed Pluckers, Not Scissors.","These tweezers are much more likely to cut the hair in half while it's still in your head than to yank it out. They may be precise, but that precision is useless if the ends are so sharp that they cut the hair before pulling it.2 stars for build quality."
2,wonderful illustrations,"Tongue twister or illeration? Don't expect to take this book home and read it aloud to your children. This book is full of poems some adults won't understand.On the other hand, the pictures here are beautiful and entertaining."
4,"Excelent disc, but only one precaution","The disc are really amaizing, it's great to practice long backhands or flicks, is sturdy and resistant.Only one objection, in the description of the product says that the product include a manual or book about the different throws, the problem is that not all the sellers of this product match that description, so be aware that the disc may will be comming alone.Besides that, was an excellent purchase."
3,Came As Described (kind of),"This item came as described. Well at least the weight of it was right. However, the color was off and it split in half within the first couple months when it hit a tree."
1,Not the Frisbee i wanted,I wanted the biggest Wham-O frisbee they make. 200+ grams. The problem is the new Wham-o frisbees are made with a really hard plastic that is very hard on your hands. The image on the site was the older soft plastic model i wanted to buy.i instead got the newer hard plastic model i did not want. Will shop this item on EBay and get what i pay for.
3,burnt out in 3 months,"right side bulb burned out in just under 3 months (was very careful to not touch glass bulb during install) did have nice white color light output, did not seem to put out a lot of actual light though. bulb came in very small box 3"" x 1.5"", plain white box with sticker on outside of box. this not a sealed pack set of bulbs that you may purchase at autozone, or other local auto parts store. i would not buy this product again."
4,I'm in it,"My names ajax, and i played the little kid they're all fighting over. you know, lucinda's kid? being in the movie was a cool expirience, even though i only got 100$.Anyway, enjoy the movie!"
4,Very Enjoyable If Imperfect,This is good movie. It is not flawless though. You can see where they had to cut corners for their limited budget. But all in all it is a fun cult movie. Worth checking out. It needed more naked chicks though.
5,Great Moviemaking!!!!!,"This is a fabulous piece of filmmaking. Anyone who didn't enjoy it is off their rocker. It's a fun and simple story of a long lost wizard who travels to New Orleans to find his bride.Christina Fulton and Jon Jacobs and co-star Leon Herbert are great in this movie. Very watchable, very fun, very good film. 'Nuff said. And check out Jon Jacobs' new comedy movie called HEY DJ. Look for it at http://www.heydjmovie.com and see the great official movie site for HEY DJ! It's even better than Lucinda's Spell!"
3,Cell Cable for Nokia Phones,"This item is good, but information in description failed to mention what type connecter it was for the modem itself. The description should say the type connection as my modem has an x-jack and this one does not. There was nothing to tell this in the information provided. I would not have ordered knowing it was the wrong connector."
1,Frisbie in a box,"This program, while it may have its uses, is poorly programmed. I've gone through the web searching all reviews for this product and found a number of them mentioning issues with bugs and features. I did this research after installing and having problems. First, importing a previously done resume in MS Word caused Resumemaker to lock up. I also have an issue when creating a new resume. I get up to the 16% complete through the wizard and get an overflow error. I've even gone as far as deleting my profile to see if it were corrupt to uninstalling/reinstalling this program. To no avail. For $30, all I have is a cardboard box and a frisbie. With how this software is programmed, it is not even worth paying them $5 for. It's just obvious the programmers coded this quick and sloppy."
3,Not compatable with MS Word.,"This software provides solid strategies for building a resume, both content and format. But it is impossible to import your resume into Microsoft Word without several formatting errors. These errors are not correctble since the errors are coded in Resumemaker before they are sent to Word. A huge delemma for you unless you're skilled at Word and willing to start formatting from scratch. This is a nearly inexcusable dissappointment for the manufacturer to have created resume product in a business world that wants your resume sent electronically. Especially when this Word import feature is sold as a benefit.It also has glitches. It frequently indicates it's saving updates to your file when it is not. I spent hours saving a updated changes to my file only to find that my original was left untouched.Buyer be ware!"
3,Hope WinWay is better because...,...this one's not that great. I can get more whistles and bells with MS Word and more GUI with DOS. Not very impressive.
2,Condemned To Live,"Condemned To Live (1935) **Had this not been so slow moving it would have been much better because it did have the potential to be a classic. As a village in Europe becomes the site of a series of horrendous murders, which the villagers believe is the cause of an animal a local doctor begins to look into the deaths and realizes the attacks were done by a vampires type creature. The doctor also shocked to find the someone closer than he knows may be responsible.Condemned To Live laid the blueprint for many a vampire film but it, itself does not live up to the horror hype."
1,"Most names not African, save your money","Being an African myself, I was really excited to read a compilation of African names...but I was bamboozled. Majority of these names are not even African. I do not understand how Arabic names are considered African. I would borrow this from the library because it is not really helpful. It is truly disappointing."
3,Awesome series; shame about the QA,"I've been reading this series since 1998, and love it. Having it available in eBook format is a fantastic plus; I'm on limited space, and need to cut back on the physical volumes.Unfortunately, this Kindle edition - unlike the physically printed ""dead tree"" edition - is marred by myriad typos and formatting errors. Some of them are minor (using the wrong apostrophe for abbreviations; hyphenation marks where they don't belong); some are more significant (spelling mistakes, probably from OCR errors that weren't caught on a proof-read; poor text flow - missing paragraph breaks and similar.)The book itself - indeed, the entire series - is a fantastic read, and well worth the asking price. Sadly, the eBook edition needs more polish before it can be called a properly finished product. The same applies to the other three books in the Westlands cycle of the overall series (I haven't yet bought the other 11 books for my Kindle.)"
5,can you say daylight....,"these lights are unreal! the euro beam gives out so much light that it really feels like driving during daylight! these are by far the best driving lights around! sure more expensive than halogens and a little more to wire, but 1000 times woth it at the end!"
5,Kenneth Cole style,"I was happy to get this watch for 2 reasons.1. Don't get many Kenneth Cole products in Aust.2. The unusual beauty of this watch.I bought this as a gift for mum. It's quite lovely. Elegant and stylish. Looks great on her wrist, while the colour and style say wear it for any occasion. It's a recent purchase so I can't comment on the durability. However it feels solid enough, and unlike my previous order it wasn't shipped from Bangkok ;)"
3,Good for beginners,"This Book is great for beginners, but if you are like me and have been researching for years. You will find out that there are links everywhere on the net for any one to get web sites to look up sites for researching there ancestry."
4,Live Reptilian NOISE,"As of the writing of this review, no track listing was provided in the product description. So, here's what is on this thang:Cows-You Are So Beautiful (yes, it's a cover of THAT song)-How Dry I Am (again, yes, it's a cover of THAT song!)Helmet-Rude-SinatraSurgery-Dear Sweet Laura-D-NiceTar-Viaduct (Viaduct Removalon Jackson)-Ballad of Storyteller (Tellermanon Jackson)What else do you need to know? It's loud, it's live, and it's noisy. If you dug the Amphetamine Reptile label at all, you need this!"
3,I was mistaken,"I had wanted to get the book by Karol Ladd ""the Power of a Positive Mom"" for a Bible study I'm doing; I couldn't tell from the information when I ordered that this ""gift edition"" was a little single sentence/phrase per page and not a book for bible study"
3,Another good Cannibal performance,"What a wonderful DVD this is. Over and hour of live music and short interview clippings as well as two music videos are enough to satisfy even the band's older fans! The great track listing, lifting material from every studio album, also adds a plus to this release. Unfortunately, the sound suffers due to Cannibal Corpse's signature guitar sound (which, you must admit, is not the cleanest) and their recent 6 to 7-string downtuned evolution. The result sounds fine through a PA, but not through your itty-bitty TV speakers. Their stage-presence has also faultered since '92's ""Eats Moscow Alive!"" video, but the band's actual playing ability has vastly improved. The addition 20 or so minutes of sound-checking footage is a really nice touch for the fans, as well."
4,True death metal concert,"Okey, I'd like to add the track list for this DVD:01. Staring Through the Eyes of the Dead02. Blowtorch Slaughter03. Stripped Raped & Strangled04. I Cum Blood05.

Disposal of the Body15. A Skull Full of Maggots16. Hammer Smashed FaceThe song selection is great, and so it is the band performance. The sound coul've been better, maybe a 5.1 or DTS track. As a musicians I love to see this guys performing: Everything seems to be perfect even with those tempo and measurements changes. Buy this DVD if you want to see one a true death metal band performing their finest tracks."
3,"Huge fan, but not of this DVD.","I have loved CC since I saw a clip of them on Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. So I started listening (found out they're Jim Carrey's favorite band) and found I loved them. ""I C** Blood"" and ""I Will Kill You"" were the first two tracks I listened to and couldn't stop listening to them. This DVD is not that great, I just can't get into the poor cinematography and camera work. Not bad sound but the cameraman must have been not been a professional."
4,Love Cannibal? Love this.,"This is a great DVD with a mix of show material. I am a fan of the band and love their work. This is not the best of their DVDs, but still a great view."
3,deal or no deal ?,"I bought this game for my dad for xmas,it is a good deal for the price ,the charachters are cartoon-like but..it is fun though if you like the show..we all enjoyed cheering & booing each other while playing it on xmas dayover all a nice game,very portable just hook it to your tv & a good price"
2,disappointed in shipping and delivery,"there was a small 4x4 box inside a larger box that had a few items in it, when I opened the smaller 4x4 box there was a packing list and loose puzzle pieces, which could have belonged to any random puzzle, there was no picture of what the puzzle was or anything. I reported the issue and Amazon greatly refunded our money, Thanks amazon."
5,The Captain from Connectcut,Great story- couldn't go to sleep until I'd finished it - a real page turner.A very well constructed story line with well portrayed characters and action. I'm not an insomniac but it would be a good way for someone who is to occupy an otherwise sleepless night.
4,Doesn't provide info for comparisons of different mini-trampolines,"As the other reviews say, it seems to be a way more than thorough discussion of rebounding. However, I had hoped to get info comparing the many different rebounders available. The author developed and sells his own rebounder -- which is not the one I ultimately bought -- so he doesn't give any specific info on others. It is definitely worth the Kindle price but not what I had hoped to get."
4,Old but Good,"Probably the best book I've read on Rebounding to date. Carter tends to over sell his rebounder, but it sounds as if it is one of the best you can buy. My only complaint is that he takes for ever to get into the techniques and training advice I bought the book to learn."
4,Rebounding information.,"Mr. Carter is the author of this book, and a pioneer in the field of rebounding. If you are a rebounding enthusiast I believe it is important to hear what Mr. Carter has to say about this form of exercise. This book is a little too technical for me, but it will help you understand why rebounding is the best low impact form of exercise on the planet. I recommend this book. Most of it is very interesting."
2,"""Linoleum"" is Very Disappointing","I just renovated my 1949-50 ranch house's kitchen into a retro look from the date the house was built. I ordered ""LINOLEUM"" with great anticipation. It was totally worthless to me. My expectations may have been too high since I had not seen the book before I ordered it online. So before you order it, make sure you check it out in a bookstore. It made maybe a total of about a page worth of comments on current products. No mention of all on their durability or success in today's real world."
2,Not what I hoped for,"I was disappointed in this book, not because I was expecting a comprehensive reference work, but because it was so extremely narrow and artificial in scope. I had hoped to see vintage linoleum patterns in vintage rooms. Instead, the focus seemed to be on the rarest and wildest linoleum rugs - most of which were displayed rolled up - and all of which seemed to come from the same store in lower Manhattan. I could have achieved the same effect by visiting the store's website, which shows all the same pictures."
3,night caller from outer space,"Even it's set in London 1965 , It's a pretty good movie in the Scifi category."
3,Night Caller From Outer Space,"Director John Gilling is true to form with his Night Caller From Outer Space a SiFi B Movie Classic! It has all the magical ingredients you would hanker for with a late 60's SiFi movie. Mystery, wonder, plenty of giant buttons & switches and naturaly a beautiful woman! If you have enjoyed such movies as The Mummy's Shroud, My Son The Vampire, The Plague of the Zombies and The Reptile then you are sure to love Night Caller! I did!"
2,Night Caller from Outer Space (sucks!),"The British seem to have a way of making science fiction boring. The theme song alone should tip off the viewer that this is not going to be a good movie. It sounds like a pop tune instead of an eerie sounding music that would set the tone for a film of this nature. This movie was supposed to be about Alien abduction of young women. The alien had reportedly abducted 21 women. However,the movie never showed a single female abduction. Instead the evil alien kills the heroine(not pretty) and a learned professor(an egghead). The hero John Saxon may as well have not even been in this film because he doesn't do anything heroic. A waste of talent. The authorities track the alien down and then allow him to fly away without any provocation. The movie is slow moving and dull. Unless you like other British Sci-Fi dull-fests like Doctor Who or They came from Outer Space, don't waste your money on this one. This is a very disappointing movie."
2,Disappointed young reader,"I like the way this book was written. I like the Quaker style of it, and that's why I picked it up. But, before I get into a book,I like to skim through it to see if it's OK- a tactic I've learned from my mom.First of all, if you hope to learn about the Quaker life from the veiw of a girl, don't read this book. All you'll bump into is a girl who gradually falls into a whimsical romantic relationship with an outcast boy that she taught how to read.Second of all, this book teaches that if you really have to, go ahead and tell a lie. In truth, there is never a time in life where you really have to tell a lie. Lies are bad with no exception. You can always work around telling a lie.So overall,this book has a good Quaker vocabulary, but a few poor moral choices."
2,Weak,"Sorry, I hate to say anything negative about Wayne Shorter, but I just can't connect to this record. It seems to have been influenced by Miles' ""Tutu"" (which I love), or other sounds of the same era, but comes out weak & poppy."
1,another low-budget hood flick,"This work breaks the mode by not being located in NYC or LA. It's in Miami. I liked too how it didn't demonize voodoo, but instead called it ancestor worship. But those are about all the good things.I do understand Ebonics, as most of the intended audience would. However, every character speaks slang in incredibly low voices. I got tired of the invisible narrator/main character. This takes bits from ""Menace II Society"" and ""New Jack City."" Every woman is referred to by the B-word, in a terribly misogynist manner. It took 15 minutes to introduce the main character's ""crew."" This had close to no plot.Only a person who loves any and all hood films would enjoy this. There is extremely little redeeming about this work."
5,Managers Desk Reference,"This is an extensive review of personel management and how to do it right. If you are a manager and want to stay out of troule, read this. If you are an employee and want to know why your boss does some of the odd things they do, buy it and read it. If you are moving up the ladder and need education in management principles, buy the book. All angles are covered and are fully up to date. Nolo publishes valuable , trustworthy, legal information which is well written and accurate. This is a superb reference desktop guide for any manager's desk. It can also be used to build your own employee handbook, customized to your own needs. I highly recommend this guidebook."
5,Common Sense advice,As a small business owner I've found this to come in very handy. It is very well organized and explained in layman's terms very well. It frequently gives peripheral information that is easy to overlook yet very important in typical workplace situations. Does this replace a lawyer? In no way. It does however get one up to speed enough to decide when things are being handled properly and when they aren't. I've also found this to be a useful tool just to read through certain portions before handling intricate matters at it seems to just get me in the right frame of mind to handle personnel related issues. It's not an overly detailed book so don't expect this to be a reference item like Black's Law Dictionary but it is a handy tool.
3,Not bad.,"Bronwyn Carlton, The Books of Faerie: Auberon's Tale (DC Comics, 1999)Carlton brings us some backstory about Auberon, King of Faerie. Not a necessary addition to the Sandman universe, but an appreciated one. Like the Books of Magic, Gaiman's disappearance from the spinoffs as head writer has affected them negatively, but they're still above average.Along with the Auberon-as-youth tale, there's a Tim Hunter piece from John Ney Rieber, which will no doubt be of interest to those following the Books of Magic. This one came off somewhat confusing (even though I had a general idea of what was going on, the specifics eluded me until the closing pages). I had originally wondered why this wasn't in one of the Books of Magic collections, and I now harbor a sneaking suspicion that it's because it's simply not as good as the Books of Magic stuff.Still, like all things Sandman, this is worth reading. ***"
5,Kirby Bags.,"So, there really isn't a lot to say about the bags.. They are Kirby bags and they work great. The price was nice and the free shipping was great. I'm a happy camper."
4,very interesting,Those were the days!... when boys were raised to be honorable men and a man who was rude to a woman would be shunned.
2,Miss Lichter's book misleading and disappointing,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. Over half of the testis spent rudely bashing the modern era. The facts about Victorianlife are such as are already known to the average third-grader. Most unpleasantly, Miss Lichter pollutes the book throughout with rude, UNmannerly accounts of the post-Victorian era, with obscenities, loaded language, and provocative and angry descriptions of the morally bankrupt society we live in today. Were I to wish to read a graceless and cheap account of how depressing today's times are, I should buy a newspaper instead. I am sorry to have learned nothing from this book."
2,Okay Read,Sandpiper Hollow Ragsdale is a 15 year old with a bad reputation.She hooks up with boys gives them oral sex and dumps them.When she does this to a guy named Derek he gets angry and starts making threats against her and her sister Daisy.During all this her mother is planning to marry again to a man named Nathan.A man Sandpiper's father Rags introduce her to once they divorced.While out one day Sandpiper meets the Walker.Called this because he wanders the nieghborhood walking.They become friends yet Walker does'nt talk much and keeps to himself.Later on Sandpiper finds out from Rags the truth about the Walker and the horrible secret he's been keeping.Yet she's determine to help him.Yet it's Walker who helps Sandpiper when Derek seeking revenge trys to rape Sandpiper.
4,Sandpiper,"Ellen Wittlinger is one of the greatest YA authors, in my opinion. I read Hard Love (which is excellent) and now I've read Sandpiper. It definitely wasn't as good as Hard Love, but there's just something about the way that Piper's life is portrayed that really draws me in. It seems realistic, and I'm so intrigued by the way her mind works. She's different from me, but she's still the type of character I look for in a book. I can be sympathetic to how she feels, but at the same time I disagree with her opinions"
3,"Okay, but not great","I own quite a few ballet DVD workouts, some of which are excellent; this is not one of those. It has its good points - the setting is lovely, the moves are well-sequenced, and the instructor obviously possesses the skills necessary. But the moves are not well-coordinated with the rhythms of the music, which I find frustrating (the voice-over instruction doesn't offer the best cueing, especially when one is not facing the screen) and ironic (dance is supposed to be rhythmic, isn't it?). The moves and the music wander away from one another like strangers disinclined to engage in any form of relationship. Such a simple thing to have done right during production!"
2,Typically unbalanced presentation from PBS,"Imagine a biographical documentary about the world's most famous sex expert that leaves out the bizarre truth about Albert Kinsey, that he was a homosexual, who often engaged in exotic tryts with his laboratory assistants, who got deeper and deeper into kinky masochistic sex, who circumcised himself without anesthesia--(who would do that except a real sicko?) No, PBS puts Kinsey on a pedestal as the man who freed us from sexual repression, and put us all on the road to sexual happiness. A very slanted propaganda piece, but what do you expect-major funding came from the Ford Foundation and Hugh Hefner."
1,I was sent the wrong video,The video that was sent to me was not the one advertised through Amazon. This is a =-( situation because I purchased the video to supplement materials for a paper and so the Hollywood version was of no use to me. Epic fail seller. Epic fail.
4,Fantastic,"This is a solid record with a few standout songs i must say, ""We won't talk about it"", ""Hate me anyways"" and ""Nowhere"" are classic 77-esque rock and roll noise.A little catchier then The Reds, but none the less obtaining the power and attitude."
3,"Great information, but why so small?","While the information and the (many in color) pictures are just the kind of thing I was searching for, the entire book is an odd-sized little paperback, small and infuriatingly difficult to view when looking for picture detail.Nice, straightforward book about the Ajanta caves, with several pictures. HOWEVER!! Does this thing come in a super-size version?"
4,A digimon song.,"From what I've heard, this is a song for the Digimon Frontier series in Japan. Being a big fan myself, I highly recommend this song. Although it's a little on the slow side, I liked it very much."
1,"sold as X-rated, boxed as NC-17, video TV-MA","The AD for this video clearly states the film is rated X, so I thought I was getting the original film, or I would have never bought it because the version sent to me is the same one shown on fox movie channel. I had previously seen the NC-17 version and it is what prompted me to try and purchase the X rated version. If anyones sees the REAL NC-17 or the X-rated versions of this film they will see a great movie. Buyer beware"
2,Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"This is a very poor movie. The acting, casting, directing, writing, filming, and any other catagory is just plain weak. There really seems to be no plot, and the movie meanders from meaningless scene to meaningless scene. The main three characters, three young women, make stupid decisions and yet there are no real consequences from them. This is the fault of the writers, who appear not to know how to write a decent outcome of a particular scene and the director, who lets his cast hang in pointlless situations.Some people may think this movie is well done. I'd guess they are really only comparing this movie to Bambi or Dumbo."
2,"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR ORIGINAL ""VALLEY"" FANS","As a huge fan of the first ""Valley"" film, I was quite excited to see this film for the first time. Although I knew it was technically not a sequel, I had heard from many others that it was ""Basically the same as the first one, just a lot racier."" Well,they were right about the racy part, but that's about it. I mean this movie is just weird for the sake of being weird. If the weirdness was a natural element of the plot as opposed to such an obviously contrived factor in the film, it would be much more palatable. While I did enjoy the campy early 70's hairdos and outfits as well as the ultra mod sets, it just wasn't enough to salvage this cinematic experience. I do wish someone would rerelease the soundtrack though, because the songs the girls performed were actually quite good!"
2,"Beyond the valley of intelligence, that's for sure","Bad acting by goofy b-movie stage actors, bad plot-- Roger Ebert should be ashamed of co-writing this garbage. after reading the reviews by reviewers here, i thought this film would be excellent and original. Boy was i wrong! don't believe everything that you read, that's for sure.This film has an NC17 rating at the video store. Why, may i ask? the sex scenes wouldn't even qualify in low-grade porn. The plot just killed whatever left the movie had to offer--which wasn't much, other than over-makeupped starlets which by appearance were somewhat entertaining. Grotesque violence is what probably got the rating, but even that is blantantly dumb and worthless when portrayed.Susann herself said that the original Valley was horrid, so i can only imagine what she'd think of this lame portrayal with a similar namesake and theme."
2,Boys shouldn't play with dolls,"I must admit there are several parts of this movie I like watching again- the musical montages and the girls band music and even the love scene between two women at the end- but I also must admit the rest is completely unbearable and was originally 93 minutes long. Beware of some newer ""modified"" versions that have some distortion in the picture too close with stretched faces, even a reedited musical number."
5,"You're a groovy boy, I'd like to strap you on sometime...","By far the best movie ever made, EVER!! This film stands out as the absolute emperor of camp cult classics. Revolving around the antics of an all girl rock band that goes to Hollywood and is corrupted by fame, money, drugs (i.e. ""Dolls""), and lesbian sex, the film is augmented by an laughably ridiculous soundtrack (""Go and Ask the Gentle People,"" ""Candy Man""), hilariously over the top racial and sexual exploitation, and a script that is such a work of art, a masterpiece of the hip lingo of yesteryear's youth, that it's been repeatedly cannibalized in countless subsequent films (the most recent being the ... ""Austin Powers"" series). I love this movie and have considered it my personal responsibility to introduce anyone and everyone to this, this ultimate opus of bad taste and sheer fun."
4,So bad its actually good!,"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is certainly the strangest film to ever have come out of Hollywood and that is saying something!Made in the 1960s by Russ Meyer, the result is a cacophony of melodrama at its worst, sex for sex sake, comedy albeit unintentional and horror also possibly unintentional!It is also a musical of sorts, in fact it has some of the best psychedelic rock in it from that era and this was for me what made the movie and stopped from failing completely as a movie.The plot is simple enough, a rock chick band head for Hollywood, desperate to realise their dreams of fame and stardom, but they fall under the spell of rock Svengali Z-Man Barzell and find themselves drawn into the seedy world of casual sex, drugs and of course rock and roll.This is ham and cheese at its best and worth watching with your friends, make sure you have a HUGE box of popcorn, lots of soda and sit back and enjoy a film that is so bad it is actually good!"
5,It's My DVD and it FREAKS ME OUT!,"A true fan knows exactly what I mean.I know every line in the movie-and even the sounds of the effects, particularly Harris falling during the TV show.Russ was way ahead of the breast implant curve.""Look on up!"""
4,And education in the classics - the camp classics.,"To truly understand Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, the first thing you have to know is that this is the movie in which ""this is my happening and it freaks me out!"" was uttered as a serious line. It's directed by former 60's porn meastro Russ Meyer, and features more sex drugs and something like rock and roll than you can shake your stick at, if you catch my drift. The plot, while tremdously convoluted, thankfully never manages to be probable. It's silly, it's fun, it's got a surprise climactic ending, and you have to respect Roger Ebert for managing to find a context for a line like ""You will drink the black sperm of my vengence!"" Although you do wonder how he got a job reviewing movies having written this one."
4,Grooviest 60's Movie Ever!,"First of all, don't expect a great movie..or even a good movie. It is, rather, a SUPER entertaining flick that is justifiably a cult classic. I recently saw it with nine friends while surfing through cable channels, and we all sat and watched it in disbelief. It was the funniest film, (NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AT ALL), full of racial and sexual stereotypes, horrible acting and bad dialogue. A heavy-handed, tongue in cheek morality tale, it has an epilogue similar to the moral preaching at the end of the Jerry Springer Show. This film is all camp. I'm glad I was with nine witnesses who also viewed it, because no one would have believed my description of the film, nor its mere existence.I don't condone drug use, but being in an ""altered state"" while watching this film couldn't hurt.This film only for those with a great sense of humor!"
3,Well...if you haven't seen Austin yet...you're damn LUCKY...,"Hey there...can someone PLEASE cut Austin Power's line off of this movie already?!?? I've heard it so many times now that I'm thinking of SELLING this movie....or giving it away as a bad Christmas present! Now it's an okay movie, I suppose....a few characters in the movie---QUITE a few---kill this entire movie...but above all...it's okay. Except for the stupid Austin Powers line....."
1,Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"Again, I ordered the DVD, but received a VHS.Just because I'm in the movie, doesn't mean it's good. I bought it for my collection. Something my grandchildren can see.......years from now."
1,"Russ Meyer, made for TV","Bad acting, weak plot, bad dialog. If Vixens was an 8, this is a 2. This was Russ dressed up for TV. Not for Russ Meyer fans.. Don't waste your time!"
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE!,"This movie is horribly written, acted, and directed, and will just plain give you the creeps (and not in a good way like a horror movie--it's just a HORROR, period!). How Roger Ebert was ever hired as a movie critic after writing this piece of garbage is beyond me!"
3,Shockingly Good!,"I taped this movie a couple of years ago because I've seen Russ Meyer's other movies (Loved Beneath the Valley of the Utravixens). This was his first legitimate movie with a major studio. Meyer set the standard for movie ratings. The movie's story was somewhat dated (Now almost 30 years old). However, Meyer's classic cinemagraphic style and his willingness to take chances made me appreciate him as a director. Overall, you're going to love him or hate him. I personally enjoyed this love fest!"
3,Beyond the Valley of the dolls,"The movie it's self is okay. When I ordered this film, I was under the impression that this was the original ""X"" rated version. What I got was the NC-17 version. This is a milder version from what the original film is. When I ordered this film, it said it was the ""X"" rated one. I also read that they had changed the rating from the x rated to the nc-17 version, but did not mention that the content in the movie was aslo changed. I am somewhat disappointed."
1,boo,I rented this first because of all the rave reviews. It stunk. I was hoping for more nudity. There's not a lot and the shots are not as good and long as in other Russ Meyer movies.
3,"Much better than ""Vally of the Dolls""","For all of you taking this movie all too seriously-Lighten up! BVD is as camp as it gets, and that's the whole point. There have been too many movies, both new and old, which don't have a clear direction. In BVD, it's already assumed that the lead actresses will be getting too high or having wild sex. The great thing about this movie was it's soundtrack. Also, the lifestyle depicted, is also quite alluring. Who doesn't want to party all the time?"
4,Two thumbs up and a blotter of acid!,"Even though it is over-mentioned and a ho-hum piece of trivia regarding the author of the screenplay, it still makes me chuckle picturing a young Roger Ebert hunched over his Underwood,wearing his love bead-adorned sweater,tap tapping away to the acrid whiffs of incense-perfumed air, his owlish glasses reflecting the lava lamp in the corner. That disturbing imagery aside, if you haven't seen the Cult Movie that defines the phrase ""Cult Movie"",you must drop everything right now and do so.This is the one film that I'm sure John Waters wishes he would have made. Everything Pop Culture is skewered and then poked with a stick to make sure it's dead in this Grand Guginol psychedelic trainwreck. Memorable songs (the birth of Grrrl Music!)set design, quotable lines, and over-the-top camp performances all around make this a great evening's entertainment and fun for the whole (Manson) family!"
5,great address book!,"I recently purchased this address books in hopes of being more organized. This book is well organized, with plenty of space under each letter for several entries. Having a large family, as I do, makes this a great feature of the book. I also appreciate the sturdy construction and classy look of this book. I am very pleased and highly recommend this product!"
5,It was a going away gift.,I think the address book is very cute. Each letter tab on the side of the book has a different pattern.
3,A Solid Effort!,"If you’ve been at loggerheads with a co-worker, calm down and read this. Bob Wall takes a close look at why the ubiquitous “personality problem” persists at work. His conclusions boil down to basics: Co-workers mix professional and personal relationships, confuse organizational roles and expectations, and simply clash due to dislike or incompatibility. He offers a number of familiar solutions to workplace conflict, advising you to pick your battles, agree to disagree and consider the possibility that you might be at fault. Not exactly rocket science, but Wall’s book is fresh, easy-to-read and reader-friendly. We ... recommend this book primarily to supervisors, who will find the dissection of professional relationships useful in managing your sometimes-hard-to-understand employees."
2,Maybe good if you work for a large corporation.,"Some good points, but as I don't work for a large corporation, much of the content was not relevant. I preferred Dale Carnegie."
3,James Dewar - Stumbledown Romancer.,"James Dewar - Stumbledown Romancer.Extremely rare solo album from James Dewar, the extraordinary vocalist and bass player with Robin Trower (among others).Produced by Matthew Fisher of Procol Harum.

1,Garbage,"I'm shocked that anyone would give this piece of junk a positive review. It's easily the worst movie I've seen all year. Most of it consists of rappers mugging endlessly into the camera, talking about their frightening experiences with da hip hop witch. Eminem (who tried unsuccessfully to have his scenes removed from the film) talks for what seems like twenty minutes about the witch trying to anally probe him. This is amusing in the most embarrassing way possible, but isn't nearly as funny as it sounds. The production values are barely above those of a home movie, the acting (particularly by the five white kids who travel to New York to find the witch) is atrocious, and as a parody of the ""Blair Witch Project"" it completely fails. There are about two genuinely funny jokes in the entire thing. The surprise ending is pathetic. Co-produced by Vanilla Ice, who hasn't been involved in anything good in his entire career. This bites."
1,Really really Bornig,"I was so exited when I heard about that movie, I wasted the more silly 18 &#128; (it's like 23 U.S. $) in my life. You don't know how boring is this movie. I only wanted to see the end of that, and then, surprise! It's the worst end I've ever seen! I was looking to the clock every minute. Don't think it is a comedy. This is nothing."
1,This movie ........,"The movie has no story line, and is not funny. The only good parts are the ones with Eminem. The camera angles are bad, The acting is worse. If i were you i would skip to my next choice for a movie."
2,Not what I expected,First of all to all you Eminem Fans- he has about 5 minutes total on screen. Wasnt as funny as I thought it would be. But for the $ it cost me I will not complain much more. I was however expecting more of Eminem.
5,EMINEM AT HIZ BEST!,"Forget 8 Mile fanz. See 8 minutes of the Eminem you're craving for. Before he went Hollywood he kept it real with his featured role with Ja Rule and Mobb Deep and his boy Royce 5'9"". Vanilla Ice was actually very believeable in it too. It's so fresh it's like Scooby Doo on ... so Holla at your boy!."
1,Sham Scam,Absolutly the worst film ever. I don't suggest buying or renting this waste of time....and I love hip -hop! This is hard pressed to even be called a movie.
1,"bad, and not in a good way","This is a horrible piece of cinematic garbage that would even embarass the folks at Mystery Science Theatre. Anyone who gives a positive review on this crap must of been involved in the production. Mr. Mogul, who claims to be a filmmaker himself, and gave this a positive review, should remember that the directors name is connected to this stinky thing forever. Regardless of rather it was made for Five-thousand or Fifty-million dollars, it is still awful, I don't care if the director and producers made enough money to buy themselves solid gold houses. Any so called filmmaker with a shred of dignity will distance themselves as far as possible from this weak, anemic excuse for entertainment. Don't believe me, ask Eminem!"
4,Pretty funny flick,"This is a pretty funny send up of the Blaire Witch project. Speaking as someone who's not a fan of rap music, but is a fan of Blaire Witch and has a pretty broad sense of humor, I couldn't stop laughing while I watched this movie. A fine beer and pizza party flick."
1,You Gotta Be Kidding,"First of all you can't even call this a film. This poorly edited video is just a promotional tool for countless rap acts that do nothing but talk about a ""black witch."" Whatever soryline there was gets stomped on by these repetative scenes. Oh yeah, Kim Rogers name is credited on the film so you know where her review is coming from."
2,preview before buying,"ok, i'll get right to the point ... the DVD of ""Da Hip Hop Witch"" was very boring. all they talk about is some girl they liked to call her complained. i kepted on asking myself wheres Eminem? finally he showed up and it was not worth the wait. I expected better but hey, i suggest you preview before buying this so-called movie. overall it was an upset."
1,Worst Movie I've Ever Seen...,"this was horrible, how can you u say it was funny when it was just plain stupid...the acting was horrible and u can tell it was impoved cause they were just talking stupidity, the only thing about this movie is because of some of the Hip-Hop heads in it, but still i do not suggest buying, renting or even watching this movie...its a waste of time and money"
2,Not to Good,"Da Hip Hop Witch was much worse than I had expected. I had thought I was going to see a hilarious movie, but most of it wasn't that funny and the acting was pretty bad. One good part about this movie was it did have many major hip-hop and rap artists like Eminem & Mobb Deep. I suggest you only see this movie if you like rap or hip-hop"
1,beyond incomprehensible,"if you care at all about trying to follow the plot of movies, da hip hop witch will drive you up the wall. it's not even a good rip off of the blair witch- i can't think of a single moment that was remotely funny. i can honestly say that this movie is one of the worst that i've ever seen."
3,The Book,"I have had this deck for a while and lost the ""cheat sheet"" it came with. I don't remember ever reading something like this with my deck. It's informative and gives some pretty good in site into the cards. However, I think some of the text isn't exactly the same as the information included in my desk. But, I could be crazy.Keep in mind, this book ONLY talks about the major in any depth. It has pictures of the minor with three or four words describing the card."
5,Great shoes at a great price!,"I absolutely love these shoes! The are dressier than normal sport shoes, but just as comfortable. I even wear them with dress pants to work in a bank, where I am on my feet all day. They are also true-to-size, so order with confidence."
5,rotor,Front Disc Brake Rotor fit very good tercel 1995.I recommend this article to my friend because it is of very good quality.
4,Mostly Newman,"A mid-80's Forbes focusing on foreign correspondent Newman and Tweed the spymaster. Newman's estranged wife, also a reporter, is filmed being run down in the shadow of a 'weird castle.' He's off on his own to Finland and Estonia to investigate, while Tweed pulls strings in the background. A cast of shadowy characters drift in and out of the narrative spotlight, while Newman seeks closure and Tweed aims to protect Britain from the evil empire. Reminiscent of Forbes' 'Terminal' (written a year earlier) in its emphasis on Newman, but lacks its more frenetic pace. As I note elsewhere, Forbes and the Tweed gang are an acquired taste, but fun."
3,"Interesting period piece, not a great thriller","""Cover Story"" was written in the mid-1980s and is set in Finland, Estonia and Sweden. It's an interesting period piece, but not a very good thriller. It moves slowly and there's very little suspense, but it gves an interesting view of the Scandinavian and Baltic countries during the Cold War. Recommended mostly to those interested in this part of history, not so much recommended to those looking for a page turner."
1,poor poor Marilyn,"It's truly sad to see what Marilyn had to do to get to the top.. Let's Make It Legal is an example of this.. This MOVIE IS TERRIBLE.Don't bother with it unless you're a DIE HARD Marilyn fan, because she's in it for like 8 minutes and it's really almost not worth it."
4,Love these cards,"I had this deck for years but lost one of the cards so I bought a new set. I use the cards for many workings not just for (and rarely for) readings. The symbolism in these cards may seem rather childish and cartoon-like but have tremendous power if used correctly. They are also small enough to take anywhere, smaller than a standard size deck. The miniature book is also useful (which comes with the deck) and they come in a handy little box. The symbolism is very straightforward. Much better than any deck I've used."
4,Pretty decent light sabers,"These lightsabers are fun for the same reason that all lightsabers are fun, they make you an instant Jedi Knight.The ""blade"" extends by gravity or force. When fully contracted, a small spring clip keeps it that way so that the handle can be hung on a belt or wasteband in true Jedi fashion. Grab the lightsaber, press the button to release the clip, give it a good swing and your ready for action!For the price, these were a real bargin. Sometimes the spring clip doesn't work so well, and they don't light up or extend automatically, but I would have no expectation from something so inexpensive (besides, no batteries = lighter weight toy). All I asked is that you can run around the house with them and they don't break on first contact. They have delivered."
4,Great Light Sabers,"My kids are enjoying these light sabers very much. It is a good buy. I thought they would be longer, so double check the dimensions. They are average size light sabers...not the long ones."
1,'Hit Job' that gets easily verified facts wrong,"This book is, needless to say, a reaction against (and a pale shadow of) Goldberg's wildly successful ""100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)""Apparently Huberman felt Goldberg's book was too hard on various left leaning prominent figures, so he decided to write this screed to provide some balance. Sadly, all it really does is provide a list of people who really, really get under Huberman's skin.The book is full of shoddy research, poor citation, and outright lies and fabrications.Perhaps the most glaring example is the section on Rush Limbaugh, where two incredibly racially incendiary quotes are listed. The only problem is that Rush Limbaugh NEVER SAID either quote, or anything remotely similar. They are pure fabrications.This book is not witty or droll - John Stewart and Stephen Colbert are witty and droll. It's simply Huberman engaging in fantasies about the people he really personally dislikes."
1,"Fabricated, Dishonest Quotes In This Book. Avoid At All Costs.","Really, this book is about lying to play to some people's deeply held prejudices against others.Why give someone money for this?"
1,Tipical Liberal Small- Minded Lies,Someone needs to educate Corky. This man would not tell the truth even if he did know what it was. This is just more liberal bias trash from someone who really does not love his country.
5,This book is hilarious!,"Instead of watching endless hours of TBN. Christians should read this book. It's not only hilarious but thought provoking as well. I'm fairly Conservative in my beliefs, but I rarely read Conservative commentary because it's so shrill and desparate. The forces of the Anti-Christ have taken over Congress, so read this book and relax...lol"
1,Typical of a liberal.....,"I have never said ""I am a republican or I am a democrat,"" But being somewhere in the middle, this book made me choose once and for all - and it's not to be liberal. It's so typical for a liberal Bush-hater to put so much effort into taking statements out of context, not doing research, and pointing fingers. My blood pressure was off the scale the entire time I was reading this book. I'm not saying Goldberg's book was perfect, but it is clearly more human and researched. I do not recommend this book to anybody who uses their brain, and actually thinks about issues rather than taking somebody's word for it."
4,Worth a listen,"This album, although not as popular as the previous releases by Wire Train, is every bit as good. The songs follow the same formula and you will not be disappointed. It is becoming very rare so pick it up at a cheap price soon!"
3,Pretty Good Set,overall with Tony Rich's Career as a Artist I've been Hit&Miss with Him because lets be real Vocally&some of His Productions Sound like alot like Babyface's.on this Set Tony Rich is able to Fuse different elements&challenge Himself more.I think this is a Pretty Good Record with the Balance of Styles&Instrumentation.I still dig Him more as a Producer&Writer on Others overrall but this Set has some good moments.
2,Tony Rich,"Of all of his albums, I liked this one the least. This album had less commercial appeal than his debut album ""Words"" and second album ""Birdseye."" Album is a neojazz-pop conglomerate with a rather weak track listing.Great buy if you are a devout fan of TRP however it does not have the same quality playlist as ""Words."""
4,Cd review,"The song that I first heard on my internet station was ""Red Wine"". I then decided to order the cd to see what other songs I would like. I was pleasantly surpised by the tracks."
2,Bad vocals...,"Although I find Tony Rich's vocals rather out of tune, there are some highlights here: 'Red Wine', 'Travelling Alone' and 'Don't Call Me' are good (in terms of melody)The lyrics are sometimes a little out of place and stupid.Maybe if he had put in better tunes, it would make up for the awful vocals."
5,Snorkeling Vest,We bought two vests for our 12 year old grandkid's first snorkeling venture in the VI. They worked well and gave the boys added confidence. This is a good product for beginner snorkelers.
5,Compassionate wisdom,"Ellen Birx has written an inspiring, wise and loving book. In HEALING ZEN she shows us how to realize, in all areas of our lives, the basic healing unity which lies at the heart of Zen practice. Ellen's uniquely compassionate voice fills each page as she shares moving stories from her life as a nurse, educator, and Zen teacher. Those new to Zen and seasoned practitioners alike will be able to appreciate this wonderful, practical addition to the growing literature devoted to healing and Zen."
1,Super Small Sectional,"This sectional is a lot smaller than the picture makes it out to be. Look at the pic of the ottoman in the picture by itself and then in the pic with the couch and you can tell it's smaller than it appears. If there was a person in each seat your feet would literally be on top of each other. The material looks/feels durable, but it isn't soft like chenille. The color is hard to describe...it looks like industrial 70's fabric...some olive, some brown, there's even little flecks of blue and red in the ribbed areas. I drove over 2 hours to see it in person and I'm glad I didn't order it! I would definitely buy something else."
3,Sofa Sectional,Company sent wrong color and never called or emailed to let me know they didn't have the color I requested. I would have sent it back but needed for a family event coming up and husband liked this color better...I don't!
1,Don't but this piece of crap!!,The springs collapse! The zippers tear! And the company Moshya Home Furnishing won't do anything for you!! It has a three month warranty and the life time of this couch is about four months!! Don't buy it!! In addition Amazon completely absolves itself from anything that would resemble customer service. The two pieces of furniture that I have bought through Amazon have both been junk. Do yourself a favor and find a local company that cares about how the customer is treated after the sale.
2,Buyer beware,"I was under the impression that this DVD would be a little bit harder core than it actually is. Though the girls are pretty, all they do is a strip tease. If you are looking for something with a harder edge, this DVD isn't for you."
1,Eh??,"This is my first Peach video....and the last. A couple nice girls (2), the rest look like street walkers in a L.A. slum. Way too much sillycone for my taste."
1,Jessica Jaymes,I gave it away. Jessica is an attractive woman but this product was not designed to compliment her. The manutacturer used quick views and quick glimpses of a beautiful woman's body. Her body was visable but her true beauty was withheld and supressed. I believe this product was designed to hook people into purchasing more. It was not acceptable. I will not order more because It wasted my money.Bill
5,Just order it and I'll tell you why,"Got a great price for a new set of the entire series. Two reviewers loved it and one hates it. All my life I've been surrounded by people who love ""comedy"" that I can't stand, and never heard of some of my favorite stuff (e.g., Dangerfield movie ""Meet Wally Sparks""), let alone disliked it.. No way am I not going to take a chance of something that's odd and two people loved. The guy who hates it may be right, but comedy is too important to let other people cut me off from it. If I don't like it, I'll stop watching. The upside vs the downside is worth more than the $30 I'm paying. Nobody tells me what's funny -- I decide.Will update after watching."
2,Broken Jewl Case,"The DVD's are fine but the jewl case came damaged. Instead of going through a long hassel of exchanging it, I just kept it anyway."
1,"Lame, stupid, and unfunny","Terrible, terrible show. Seriously, how can anyone watching this not want to strangle all involved in making it for being such morons? A guy wears a wig and talks like an old person. Wow. That's hilarious. Girls show their naked breasts. How cutting edge. Super Dave gets trash compacted in a car. What a riot. People talk using words on their shirts. Oh my god, that's so crazy. A guy with his cheeks stuffed talks like Marlon Brando in The Godfather. How groundbreaking. Yep that's it. For as many DVDs in the various volumes for sale as you'd care to waste your money on. You were warned."
1,Be careful ! !!,"I was generally disappointed in the product quality. The adhesive tape on the moustache and goatee was so tiny that the units would not stick properly. I had to supplement the tape throughout the night. The hat was a little better, however we had to iron it (no easy job) to get it shaped properly. If you purchase these, plan on starting early to get everything ready."
1,Tell me what you feel now without the heartbeat.,"This album features Miami Vice star Don Johnson singing '80s style pop/rock songs. It's pretty boring stuff, even though the title song was a Top 5 hit. Somehow, he managed to get people like Willie Nelson, Bonnie Raitt, Ron Wood and Stevie Ray Vaughan to contribute to the album, but it didn't help much."
1,since mr freeze comes from tenn it is understandable he likes this album,mr freeze needs to get a life. this album sucks really BAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,A very good album!!! Don's Best work besides Vice!,"I always keep hearing people badmouth this album andI am sick and tired of it. This is not a bad album!If anything this sure as hell is better than any oftoday's music...and by that I mean anything made in thelast 16 years.The best songs off this record are Heartbeat, Voice on a Hotline, Gotta Get Away, and Last Sound Love Makes.""Voice"", and ""Heartbeat"" put anything out there today to shame!Also I recommend Don's second release Let it Roll from 1989.Not as good as Heartbeat, but has a few good tracks on it.For newcomers to Don's music you should reallycheck out the Heartbeat video. There's unreleasedsongs on the video. One of the unreleased songsis Street Wise, which was used in one episode of Miami Vice!"
2,"Music for ""Vice""-ers","Don Johnson's ""Heartbeat"" is a relic for ""Miami Vice"" aficionados and no one else. I can't feel any negativity toward Mr. Johnson. He goes through the motions for 10 tracks (see lyrics like ""Let's tear off these walls, I swear they're closin' in/Tired of being told there is no way to win""), but his intentions seem honest, and it's still a step up from Journey, thanks to aid from Omar Hakim, Tom Petty, Willie Nelson, Ron Wood, and, maybe in this case, Stevie Ray Vaughan. Take what you can from it, if you make it past eyeing the record in the $1.00 bin. It's celebrity tourism, plain and simple, and all that ever came from that is a little bit of money and a bin full of $1.00 records."
2,CARDIAC ARREST HIM !,"From this CD one can easily assume that, in the late 80s, JOHNSON attempted to rapidly cash in on his television popularity (a la DAVID SOUL).However, his single (HEARTBEAT) did little to impact the Billboard pop charts as did other celebrity recordings before him (JOHN TRAVOLTA, DAVID SOUL or even CHERYL LADD).The production on this cheesy CD is ""BAD vintage 80s"". Totally out dated! This CD is good for a few laughs when played alongside other prime recordings acts such as WILLIAM (Star Treck) SHATNER and/or LINDA(Wonder Woman)CARTER.This CD is truly not recommended unless you remain a die hard fan of pastel suits and bad vocals."
5,DON JOHNSON IS THE BEST!!!!!,"This is the perfect Miami Vice soundtrack album. Don Johnson has the talent to be a big time rocker like John Mellencamp and Bruce Springsteen. The song ""Last sound love makes"" is my all time favorite. Buy this album now!! This is great stuff."
5,Hot-Beat!,"How can anyone dislike the song ""Heartbeat? I mean look how it starts, the sound of the jet engine revving up which creates the ambiance of Karaoke Night on the runway at LAX. Look how Don emotes, like he's getting a prostate exam on stage.When he hits those high notes of ""hot-beet"", like a man&#65279; getting defibrilated in a bathtub, I'm totally sold. This is the equal of David Hasselhoff's ""Hot Shot City"""
5,MichaelJames,This is the best CD on the market. The origional 1986 version is the collectors edition with only 10 songs. Remakes were made years later that contain 16 songs but the origional is still the best.
3,What did you expect?,"At that time Don Johnson was HOT. Miami Vice was new and contained such great music. I bought this album when it first came out because I was and am a DJ fan. It's not a Sgt. Peppers masterpiece, but I liked a few songs a lot. Heartache Away was my favorite. This album is not going to appeal to a large audience but if you like DJ you will like it."
4,BRILLIANT MOON,THIS IS A GOOD VIDEO BUT IT WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR - DO CHECK IT OUT IT MAY WE GOOD FOR YOU
1,doesn't go with GPSMap,"It is not a GPSMap accessory, I've already returned it. It is cable for fish finder or sth like that!"
5,Accept's the best release!!!!,"Frankly, the best of the rest. I am longing for Accept's past especially Metal Heart and Russian Roulette. This is military strong CD!!!"
2,"One to miss, unfortunately.","I wanted to like this so much but I just cannot, the songs and sound are so weak. For pure heavy metal from Accept the best it gets buy Restless & Wild, Balls to the Wall and Metal Heart, I cannot comment on any others (except Breaker some good songs but poor sound)."
3,Just Average Accept,"'Metal Heart' and 'Balls to the Wall' were the first hit albums that brought this German hybrid version of Judas Priest and AC/DC into the spotlight and this is the album that followed the two. I listened to this album a lot when it came out and I still like Accept but this is really not their best stuff. Like a lot of other metal from the mid-80s, it has just passed its expiration date.Udo Dirkschneider is a reasonably good singer to the likes of Brian Johnson and Wolf Hoffmann is a good lead guitarist which keeps Accept in the above average level of otherwise forgettable '80s bands like Armored Saint or Grim Reaper. The title track is pretty good along with 'Aiming High' and 'Heaven is Hell' but the rest is pretty forgettable.This is not the album you want to start with if you're going to listen to Accept though. 'Balls to the Wall' and 'Metal Heart' are better albums but 'Restless and Wild' and 'Breaker' are their best albums in my book: heavier and more original."
4,Wish this video had a four mile walk,I have been walking with leslie for a a while. I also walk outdoors. Since the weather was starting to become cold I decided to update my indoor walking videos. I was surprised to see that leslie has added weights with her walk. I use my 3 pound free weights with this video. I just wish the video was a longer 4 mile walk!
2,Abs workout,I don't really care for the DVD. I actually have two of the three workouts on single DVDs
3,Disappointed with the Quality.,"I usually am very satisfied with anything I buy from Amazon. But I just bought the DVD: Leslie Sansone: Walk Away the Pounds for Abs. I would like to have known that the Belt that they use in the exercise is not included. I have bought Leslie Sansone's Dvd's before, and if she uses a stretch band it has been included. So I amvery disappointed that it is not mentioned that the belt is used,and not included.Also, the day after I received it, it was reduced in price. So now I am very unhappy. Is it the dealer that is responsible for this, or who is? I love Leslie Sansones Dvd's. But I would like to know why such poor service this time.Thank you Ruth Hunt."
4,Good set of workouts using walk belt,"I purchased this DVD because it used the walk belt and I had recently gotten the newer DVD set with the 3 mile workout and the walk belt (http://www.amazon.com/Leslie-Sansone-Waistline-Markers-Included/dp/B000WC38CS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1266249109&sr=8-1) and was looking for additional workouts. This one does not come with the belt however, so make sure you have it if you're just going to order this disc. I'm sure the workout would work without the belt but it wouldn't really work your abs any extra. It has three separate workouts of 1, 2 and 3 miles, each with warm up and cool down, and all use the belt. Good workouts, and using the belt does increase the use of your core. Definitely recommend!"
3,Quiet Riot falls out of the limelight.,"I remember when MTV had ""The WIld and The Young"" in heavy rotation. I was a good catchy anthem. True it was difficult watching Kevin DuBrow wearing that oversized poodle wig without cracking up. The man with no hairline for the last two albums now had Bon Jovi hair times 10!The album has a couple good songs here and there like maybe ""Put it up or shut it up."" But this album has a lot to much synth and pop polish for my taste.There must have been a misgiving with Kevin 'The Mouth' DuBrow because after this album he was tempoarily replaced for the next album 'Quiet Riot'. I heard he had been bad mouthing the prodcuer behind his back when the guy was actually standing behind HIS back!! HA ha, only in Rock n Roll."
2,Quiet Riot abandons what made them successful,"Quiet Riot abandons the party anthems, Slade covers, and great guitars, to just plain stinks. This is keyboard heavy, half ballads, with songs that repeat three words over and over. They have huge puffy hair, then do the Styx Kilroy ""were here to save rock and roll"" in the Wild & Young video, then try to do horror films in the Twilight Hotel video. Going in all directions, succeeding in none. Put up or shut up is the only good song here. Fortunately, Poison picked up the party anthem mantle and ran with it."
2,Too slick and poppy!,"Let's face it, Quiet Riot didn't make great albums, but they sure did have some good headbanging tunes on their first two albums. For their third release, they decided to crank up the keyboards and go for a much poppier sound. Now I guess that would be okay if the songs were catchy, but they mostly aren't. I do like ""The Wild And The Young"" even though it is much too slick and overproduced. I also enjoy ""Put Up Or Shut Up"" as a good, dumb rocker. But that's it. The rest of this disc is quite forgettable."
1,This should have stayed Quiet,"This is just 80's radio tripe. This type of. crap is what killed a once great band. Metal Health, pass on the rest."
4,QR 3,"This is the best album of QR's career, even though it didn't sell very good the passion was there. Rudy should've hung on just a little longer instead of leaving the band before this one. It's an excellent piece of work."
3,More cheese please.....,"At the time of release Quiet Riot was on the way down. Their audience had become much smaller since the days of their ""metal health"" success. Although this recording does have some good tunes on it, ""Main attraction"" "" The wild & the young"" ""twilight hotel"" and another wanna be anthem rocker ""helping hands"". It falls short of their previous records. Maybe the lack of another Slade song to cover, or maybe the return of Kevin Dubrow's hair had something to do with this."
2,QR gets off on the pop kick typical of the year.,"Quiet Riot must have been wanting to keep up with the likes of Europe with this album. Seems like everyone made efforts to go heavy on the keyboards in 1986: Judas Priest, Keel, and Iron Maiden just to name a few. Being a huge Quiet Riot fan, I can find some redeeming value in this effort, but it is keyboard driven as opposed to guitar driven, and it seems like Carlos Cavazo was only needed for his solos and no riffs. Unless you are either a completist QR fan or you're really into the keyboard-heavy scene of the mid 80s, pass on this one."
3,It's good...,"It definitely could have been better, hotter and more teasing. But then it would fall into the ""hardcore"" category. However it is not bad to have it and on the other hand you dont miss much if you dont. This is the kind of thematology that really cant be fullfilled in the soft porn area. That's why scenes are not allowed to evolve to full extent. Nice girls in there, but dont expect to see detailed full scale action of what the ladies are doing when alone..."
1,Warning! Retread,"Won't belabor this review. This is pretty much standard Peach, in terms of babes, quality & ""pink"". Think greatest hits - but more like greatest ""misses"". Its serious retread of average scenes from Peach DVDs you've seen if you've seen any 6 Peach titles.Not bad, but I've seen it before. They should give you a better 'heads-up' on these and let you know which DVDs they're cannibalizing beforehand."
4,A Deaf person's opinion,"As a Deaf person, I frequently evaluate various ASL resources. I have found this particular book to have book positive and negative traits, but weighs more heavily on the positive side.The pictures are good (not the best), the memory aids are a wonderful asset, but my favorite part is the fact that this dictionary shows many idiomatic ASL expressions in addition to simple vocabulary. Many dictionaries focus only on building sign vocabulary, but it is important to recognize various expressions in order to readily engage in an ASL conversation with a deaf individual. I think this book will serve you well until you have grasped enough knowledge to move on to more in-depth study. :o)"
5,Wonderful Resource for Educational Interpreters,"As an educational interpreter, it is hard to find resources that are as complete as this one is. This ASL dictionary is a concise description of most uses for the same sign even if that sign can be used in a different context. That is important once you start teaching your student the differeces in multiple meaing words and signs.I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting a complete and easy to use dictionary for Sign Language. Beginners as well as professionals can use this dictionary with the greatest of ease."
2,Not as described,"I agree w/ previous reviews that this book has rarely used words like ""premeditate"" and ""idiom"" but not common words like ""broccoli"". It also says it has common phrases. Well, it has ""close call"" but not ""your welcome"". I find it easy to use for the words that I can find in there that I need but it is not the complete resource that I thought it would be."
3,A good resource,"This book has many words, but is far from complete (does not include religious signs, most sexual signs, and most uncommon words/signs). The signs also semi-frequently differed to what I've seen and learned. However, the signs are fairly easy to follow (illustration accompanied by directions). If a sign has another meaning that is noted. If a word has several signs for different meanings, they are all also listed. This book also has a few pages dedicated to how to use the language (like classifier and NMM's), but it is mainly just a dictionary. This book was used as the principle dictionary for my ASL 1 class (at the University of South Florida. Overall, I think this book is worth buying, but, there are better (more complete) ASL dictionaries out there (like American Sign Language [UNABRIDGED])."
5,Wonderful Vocabulary,"I just recently bought this book and found it to be wonderful. The extensive vocabulary was outstanding. For Example, I have many sign language books as I am an interpreter for the deaf and never would have found the word/sign ""luggage"" or ""layaway"" in any other sign book.2 hands up on this one :-) !!!!!"
4,THE BEST SIGNS DESCRIPTIONS YOU CAN FIND,"THIS IS A GOOD DICTIONARY, IT GIVES FINE DEFINITIONS OF EVERY CONCEPT REPRESENTED BY EACH SIGN... AND HELP YOU TO LEARN HOW TO SIGN PROVIDING THE BEST DESCRIPTIONS OF EVERY SIGN YOU MAY FIND IN A DICTIONARY OF THIS KIND. MOST DRAWINGS ARE EXCELLENT, EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND EASY TO FOLLOW AS MODEL TO COMMUNICATE THE IDEAS AND THOUGHTS YOU MAY HAVE TO SHARE WITH A DEAF PERSON."
3,American Sign Language Dictonary,I thought it was the newer one. There was writing in the book. since I am taking classes I am concerned that the signs have changed or that they are no longer in use.
4,A Good Documentary- with Great Music!,"For a documentary made in 1987, this is good!It has interviews with Drummer Elvin Jones,Piano player McCoy Tyner- and evensome old sound clips of Coltrane talking!The live footage is taken from several oldTV broadcasts, and while we don't get anyfull-length numbers, the music is stillvery enjoyable and satisfying!Today they could make a much better documentaryon Coltrane, with maybe some full performancesincluded on the DVD as a bonus,But for now, go with this DVD!"
5,OH BOY!,BACK A NUMBER OF YEARS WHEN I GOT MY FIRST VCR AND CABLE WAS RELATIVLY NEW(IF THE WIND BLEW TO HARD YOUR RECEPTION WOULD GO OUT)I SAW THIS ON PBS ONE NIGHT.ICOULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES THAT IT WAS REALLY JOHN COLTRANE PLAYING.UP TO THAT TIME I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY FILM OF HIM AND IT JUST BLEW ME AWAY!BEING THAT THERE IS SO PRECIOUS FEW VIDEOS OF HIM THIS IS CERTAINLY A MUST HAVE.TO SEE THE MASTER PLAY IS AN AWESOME EXPERIENCE.
1,skip it,"Obviously enough, Buckley had already written as much as he knows about Bowie in his definitive biography, which is definitely worth a read. This book has apparently just been shoved out there to make some more money; Buckley just provides a few very brief, random, chatty observations about the records. There's neither information nor interpretation, and this book is simply not worth reading, not even for dedicated fans.Anyone seriously inerested in Bowie should instead try The Complete David Bowie by Nicholas Pegg, which is a mine of information."
4,Review 1,It's kind of outn of date ( 5* years) but it will be good for my son who will be entering the Air Force basic this June 07.
1,Lop Sided,"This is oval and lop sided. I tried using it more to get it to even out, but the shape stayed the same, oval. When you try to kick it, you never know which way it's going to go. It's like playing basket ball with a football."
3,Fashion Doll Dining Room,"Dining Room in Plastic Canvas (Fashion Doll Playhouse Book 4) (Craft Book)I found this to be a very difficult book. The instructions were hard to follow, and the inside of the buffet did not look good, the drawers on the buffet and china cabinet did not move smoothly, and the cart was difficult to put together. The idea of not whipstitching the ends of each piece made a cute design though, and the placemates were adorable."
4,Enlightening,"This is a wonderful book, and the author presents many different angles and perspectives to the ""Newness"" of the New Covenant. I don't think he comes right out and says it, but Hoch seems to fall in the category of Progressive Dispensationalist. He spends quite a bit of time showing how Gentiles are never referred to in Scripture as Jews or Israel. This is the only reason I give it four stars out of five, only because I'm still not 100% convicted that he is right--but he certainly does a commendable job of making his case.The Jew/Gentile issue is not the main focus of this book however-- Newness is. This is a great book to discover just how new ""Newness"" is."
5,Informative AND funny,"I had already read The 9 Ways of Working, and I assumed this would be similar. I couldn't have been more wrong. While I liked ""Ways of Working"", this was a much more useful book. It talks about actual behaviors, not just general ways of working. I am a bit embarrassed to admit it, but when I have been off my game, my management methods slightly resembled some of the persons depicted in this book. I can see more clearly now why some of my projects did not do as well as others. Another aspect of this book that I liked was the simple, straightforward description of bad method. It is a very sensible book, while remaining humorous."
4,Very enjoyable,"I had this performance on DVD and it was not optimized for 16x9 so never looked full screen on laptop. Bought this Blu Ray which is European but it plays fine on my Sony US laptop and Panasonic Blu Ray players. The concert was recorded in 1993 so the image is not as razor sharp as some of the latest discs but I find it very very acceptable, I found the sound equally enjoyable and am very pleased with my purchase. A valuable addition to any Holiday Season. I was worried given all the negativity on this site but I have no issues playing back on all3 of my sets of US equipment, sounds like some Sony players may have problem with all region disks. Very enjoyable."
5,Blue-Eyed Soul!,"This is one of the best new artists I've heard in a LONG time! I can't help but move to the music when I have the CD on!Hope we don't have to wait as long for the next one!Best of luck, Kelly!"
1,Sibt RDRVX555 DVD Recirder/VHS Combo Player,"The entire reason for ordering this product was so I could record television programs. No where in the description did it advise that the recording of TV programs could only be done if you have cable or satelite which is I do not, so I have spent over $200.00 for an item of no use to me."
1,Junk,"The bottom line is that as this unit gets older, playback of commercial DVDs gets worse. I'm not talking about some videophile crap, I'm talking about being able to watch a movie, period.I have commercial DVDs that simply don't play on this unit, or sometimes freeze in the middle of playing. These are not DVD's purchased from some flea market, these are Disney/Pixar and other big studio films purchased at regular retail stores. When the unit was new, the problems only occurred with a few DVDs; now it happens with virtually every DVD.Sony should stand behind these units and recall them.If you are looking at picking one up, new or used, DON'T."
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOU WANT TO RECORD CABLE TV,"Everything works fine and it would be a great product, but, if you want to record cable or satellite TV premium channels, forget it!! There is a copy protection system in this unit that displays a notice saying you cannot copy these channels, then stops recording. Certain premium channel providers may not use the blocking signal yet from what I have heard. But the majority do, so beware. It will allow recording of these channels to the VHS tape but not the DVD. Most other brands of recorders will allow DVD recording with no blocking. Sony is automatically assuming we are all pirates. I am recording these channels (which I am paying a premium price for) for my own personal use. I consider this ""fair use"" of the video. I erase them then record again. The new unit I purchased from Radio Shack has the same ""one touch"" features for recording home movies as well. I am never buying a Sony recorder again."
2,Do not purchase this Sony VCR/DVD Recorder,I purchased this Sony VCR/DVD Recorder only three and a half months ago and I'm ready to throw it out the window. This machine is both noisy and slow to load. The big problems are that it constantly freezes and skips while playing DVDs and some DVDs it won't even play at all. Every DVD that I've had a problem with in the VCR/DVD Recorder plays fine in my Sony Playstation 2. It's amazing that a seven year old PS2 will play the DVD fine but a brand new DVD player won't. I owned a different Sony VCR/DVD combo a couple of years ago and had problems with that one also. I will never purchase another SONY DVD player again.
1,Don't buy SONY DVD players (or recorders),"Buttons are tiny and unreadable. Cost was high. Most DVD's skip and freeze if newer (more dense). SONY should have recalled this and fix it for free, but charges $114 to fix it (and you have to mail it to them unless you live really close to a repair station). NO MORE SONY PRODUCTS FOR US."
1,Buyer Beware: This device will not record DVDs,"This device will not record anything from an outside source, period. It is simply designed to consider any outside source as copyrighted. I am a video producer and create my own material. It has no DRM on it, but this machine simply assumes it has DRM and will not record it. This machine's only value is dubbing VHS tapes to DVDs and should not be purchased for any other purpose"
1,Player freezes up,"Player freezes up.I purchased this player recorder for my wife at Best Buy.She is very pleased with the recorder function and how easy it is toconvert VHS to DVD.But, after about an hour or so of playing a DVD the player momentarily freezes up.I tried different factory recorded DVDs.I paid $50 for the best Buy warranty. I took it back to Best Buy for repair.After They had it for 2 weeks they called us to inform us that they had to send it to Sony. 2 weeks after that we were informed that it was ready for us to pick up.Best Buy said that Sony replaced the""Loader"". We got it home, after being in repair for a month. The problem was still there! After playing a DVD for about an hour it intermittently locks up. I am very frustrated."
5,excelente calidad,"muy buen producto,llego en excelentes condiciones y entre el rango de fecha para el envió. el vendedor es muy responsable."
5,"Great for anime lovers-very detailed, suspense, very funny!","These two tapes are very descriptive. You learn so much about the characters who suddenly fall into the world of Cephiro. The three young 8th grade girls, Hikaru Shidou, Fuu Houji, and Umi Rauzaki battle their way to destroy the evil high priest Zagato to save the Pillar of Cephiro-Princess Emaruade."
5,Le Corsaire: ABC Coup,"We watched the American Ballet Company production of this magnificent ballet on PBS tonight, 20 December 1999. It is an absolutely superb production with some of the most athletic dancing we have ever seen. It's an exotic plot, set in an Orientalia kingdom--a pasha is the opera buffo--and involving lovely slave maidens, handsome male adventurers, and intrigue. Its history is interesting too: over the years, many Russian composers have contributed bits and parts so that today, about six composers in all (Tchaikowsky, Glinka, Berlioz et al are part of the composers' ensemble). This great ballet survives only because Russia preserved its many transformations. See it. It is marvelous, and a whole new introduction to classical ballet."
3,"Good but the Kirov ballet's version is much, much better","I had the oportunity to attend in the Royal Theater of my city the Kirov's version of ""The Corsaire"" a couple of months ago and enjoyed it so, so much that got both the ABT's version and also the DVD from Kirov's. I have to say that the ABT makes a cute and nice performance, but the strength, the virtuosity, the genious, the humour and the incredible rythm is achieved by the Kirov's ballet. Honest, if you have not seen the Kirov yet... what are you waiting for?"
3,"Viewer from Rydal, PA is commenting on another performance","I agree with the viewer from Rydal, PA about the excellent performance he/she discusses, but this American Ballet Theater DVD version is another altogether; completely different casts."
3,"Great dancing, very poor interviews of performers.","The dancing is technically excellent taken by itself.The interviews and comments of the performers came across to me as being silly, childish, immature and detracted from their real talent--DANCING. Giggling and supposed ""cutsie"" facial expressions were a severe detraction and reflected adversely on their total performance. Bad judgement of someone involved in the production of this DVD.Louis and Janet Schlom"
4,quality siding nailer,I am a remodler in Houston. I bought this nail gun about a 1 1/2 years ago. I have completed 4 big siding jobs with it. I like the gun enough to have just ordered another one.4
3,Okay product,"I have mixed feelings about this product. It is built very well, the case is nice, and it does what it's advertised to do. I seem to have problems with it jamming. I've read a lot of reviews and most people say if you use off-brand nails, it will miss-fire and jam. For this exact reason, I purchased the approved Bostitch brand nails designed for this gun. It seems like it's either good or it's not. I get it aligned in there perfect, to fire 1-2 nails before another jam. I then get it go 50-75 nails without any jams. What makes the first 15 nails jam who knows? It's easy to use, but I think next time I'd just get a roofing nailer."
4,Bostitch N66 Coil Siding Nailer,"I used a model N64 for years and although heavier than the newer N66 it was much quieter and less ""tinny"" sounding. The gun works well but I liked the older model better."
1,Nailer Failed Quickly,"I purchased this nailer primarily because of the good reviews. After receiving it yesterday, I installed the air chuck and oiled the unit per the instructions. I prepared my project this morning and began using the new nailer, but after shooting 20 nails, the unit failed with the driver unit (plunger) stuck in the down position. I called Stanley-Bostitch Tech Support and they said the o-ring in the trigger valve failed and was probably because Amazon had it on the shelf too long which caused the o-ring to dry out!!! I cannot believe that is what caused the failure...though I did notice the unit is now made in Taiwan instead of the US plant in Indiana. They are shipping the new trigger valve today and now my project has to wait for parts that I hope will remedy the problem. Having to repair a new nailer is more than disappointing."
4,Parts and Repair,"We love this Bostitch nailer, especially the magnesium housing because it is so strong and durable. I read another review on here about the nails on this being available almost everywhere and I would have to agree, whether your going to your local hardware store or doing the google search online for Bostitch parts, your sure to find something on this one, so yes it is popular and well known. Another good point I would like to mention, is we handle Bostitch parts repair and when handling this nailer, I would have to see it was a good job and very satisfying. Everything went smoothly and for that I highly recommend the N66C-1 Nailer from Bostitch.Brandon_________________eReplacementPartsPower Tool Parts and Parts Repair"
5,Bostitch siding nailer,The Bostitch N66 siding nailer is a great product. I've used it a lot to install wood fiber cement siding and not once has it jammed or misfired. Very light weight. Overall it is worth every penny.
1,AVOID THIS TOOL,"Made in Taiwan, I've never had good luck with Taiwan/China made tools.There are better options with Makita, Max, or Hitachi"
2,n66 Bostich not very good,"i bought this gun about 2 years ago and I am quite disappointed in it's performance. i am a builder and use it primarily for siding. It will not completely drive nails into anything much harder than cedar or balsa wood!! Forget about driving into Hardie trim or even Miratec. Like a lot of Bostich nailers, it's a piece of junk!"
4,Great gun,"Purchased this gun after a very lengthy research process. I read review after review. I am a Property manager and I do all my own work on the properties. I used this gun to install fiber cement siding. I only had a handful of ""double fires"" and I thought that was more than acceptable. The gun only ""jammed"" once. I installed about 200 pieces of siding at 12ft. pieces. Amazon has the lowest price that I have found for a new unused gun. The competitors had higher prices overall that is not including the tax. Product arrived as advertised and works great. The product is a little pricey but I was willing to pay it based on what I am using it for. The is a quality product so (I hope) it will last a long long time. If you are just doing a one time job or for occasional use a cheaper gun may be the answer."
5,Works great.,"Gave this to one of our production siding crews. It joined several other Bostitch coil nailers. Function is perfect, no jams at all. Sets nails to the correct depth every time once adjusted. The guys commented that they liked how light it is and comfortable to handle. It won't drive very big nails, but handles siding and sheathing nails just fine. In the first month it ran about 15,000 nails, three different brands of nails at that, and no reports of any trouble; we will be adding more of these to our toolbox."
4,what kind of review is this before me? good recording,"This disc does not look serious, but it sure contains some severe music. I think the style is too straight forward, which is not the way this kind of music should be treated . This symphonie is supposed to be an enigma from Austria, not entertainement without a begining or an end. I own a cd by Vladimir Delman, who is not so known as Daniel. He performs this symphonie with the assistance of Orquestra sinfoninca dell emilia romagna arturo toscanini. I prefer this version. Perhaps that product is not sold outside Italy. I bought it in the Netherlands though on a sales basis (in an outlet). Why does not amazon rate this version?For this product: 4 stars only because of the superficial way the music is treated here, good sound quality and not bad performance. I like this symphonie."
1,What Music?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!,PLEASE TELL US WHAT WORKS ARE ON THIS CD...THANK YOU!!!!!!!!Symphonies????maybe?????????
5,Mobb Deep is back,This is a gangsta album this is the best album of the year Mobb deep is one of the best group of all time get this album.
2,FOUR STARS!!!!>>>YOU CRAZY>>>MAYBE ONE!!,"As I was reading some of these reviews...I was thinking somebody from Mobb Deep is writing these reviews to gain more sales. This mixtape albulm is not the sh@t...its a piece of sh@t. Mobb Deep WAS the shi@t..but when they keep on putting stuff like this out, they keep on proving to people who KNOW...that they went down hill. Prodigy lost it...he ain't hungry like he used to be. Havoc has improved his lyrical skills since infamous. But that can only help alittle. They got some good songs on this...Bump That is good...double shots ain't bad...but the hook is wack. Mobb Deep is like Wu - Tang...when they first came out they were nice...there still around and they got some good tracks here and there...but they old, lazy, and ain't up to date."
2,Too repetitive,"This album becomes way too repetitive after a while, and only the first few songs are actually good. The Bonus CD seems just thrown in there for grins. this is a cd that only should be bought if ur a die hard mobb fan otherwise dont waste ur time. the top songs are solidified and survival of the fittest 2003. also, why do they have to use their old songs for success? i love mobb deep so dont come dissin but cmon make some new stuff dont just make shook ones part 3 and such. i guess its impossible to surpass a classic like the infamous, and shook ones pt II will always be the greatest song in history."
5,Monster cable,This product works great I received it in a short amount of time and plug it in to my instrument and Mac notebook and garageband saw it and I was able to use my instrument right away.
4,Party Hit,"I got this book for a 1950s themed party I was holding. While it focuses more on Prohibition-era drinks, it has a great selection of classics (and ones no one has heard of) and the history behind them. It even has the ""true"" version of my favorite drink, the Sidecar."
2,Tupac and James Belushi......hmm......not a good combination,"You got Tupac Shakur (Gridlock'd, Bullet) in his last movie before his death, which he shows some very good acting skills might I say and then on the other side you got a chubby and overly miscast James Belushi (Destiny Turns On The Radio, The Florentine) sprouting a top hat threw the movie. These 2 cops sell cocaine to dealers, kill them and then throw away the drugs but they make a mistake when they kill a DEA Agent instead of a dealer. Things spiral down from there in this edgy urbanesque action thriller. Not much when the story is hammy. Also starring Dennis Quaid (Frequency, The Day After Tomorrow), Lela Rochon (The Big Hit, Waiting To Exhale), David Paymer (Quiz Show, Payback), James Earl Jones (Field Of Dreams, Empire Strikes Back), Gary Cole (A Simple Plan, Office Space) and Wendy Crewson (Air Force One)."
2,Trying to hit a home run with a whiffle ball,"The producers likely thanked their lucky stars when 2Pac Shakur got shot... it was about the only good publicity they got which enabled them to hustle a few more butts in the theatres than the film itself warranted.I don't deny 2Pac is by most accounts, an average actor, and in this film, he really makes James Belushi look like garbage.Which, to be honest, isn't hard to do--he's never learned that comedy is his terrain, as it was his brother's. His forays into anything else come off as useless, by comparison. He's just walking through the occasionally inventive script, and likely was rooting for his paycheque at the end of each shoot.The film itself is less than a rental, and only 2Pac fans will pay money for this. For me it was a free rental, although I would have paid good money NOT to see it."
2,Tupacs worst movie ever!,"I hated this movie, I rented it hoping it would have a big action plot, but what I Seen was a boring Cop movie, I rated it a two because tupac is da bomb 4 life R.I.P"
2,Could have been so much better,Gang Related had me a bit exicted back in 97 it was the last movie performance of Tupac. I was also more of a fan of Tupac the actor than of Tupac the rapper and he's the only good thing in this slow paced and somewhat predictable movie. James Belushi makes a horrible bad guy and Dennis Quaid is watsed. See this one just for Shakur's performance.
4,fun action movie,This is a great movie to watch when you want to relax and enjoy an action movie. Watch the beginning to get the plot behind the movie. Nice looking cast that is fun to watch.
1,quite possibly...,"...the worst movie ever made. I am POSITIVE that the previous reviewer was either being sarcastic, or was the original director of the movie. Holy Cow, how do some producers in Hollywood get this crap made is a mystery to me. I haven't seen John Travolta's Battlefield Earth, nor do I plan on doing so, but this movie has to be right up there with some of the worst acting/directing/producing ever made. Also, all the action heroes all sport the same fraternity-boy haircut. Jesus Christ, I'm disappointed I even devoted minutes out of my life to watch this crap...absolute garbage"
1,This product is only good when it works,"I like this product when it works but, I have problems gettting it to work. If asked if, I would buy it again, the answer would be absolutely, not. I am disattisfied totally."
2,Good story line but needed a new author...,"I always hate when I read reviews where the reviewer states that they couldn't read past the first chapter or so because what's to determine after just one chapter? Anyway, I have finally come to the point after all my years of reading where I had to close a book without finishing it. I made it to page 50 but I found that I kept reading the pages over & over again because nothing was making sense. Half of the time I couldn't figure out if what they were saying/thinking was in the present or past. I skimmed ahead reading several different parts to see if it looked like it would get better but it never did. I can't say that I will ever read another book from this author. The only reason I gave it a 2 rather then a 1 was because I didn't finish it & therefore don't know 100% if my feelings would have changed but I seriously doubt it. Pass on this book & you'll save yourself a headache."
3,Good easy reading,"The storyline is great, though I do not think the author developed it to its potential. I felt the main characters lacked the suspenseful sizzle one wants in a romance novel. The author could have developed more deeply the difficulty of living in a new land with an unintended spouse and the long road of understanding and mishaps it took to recognize they were right for each other after all.This is a good, enjoyable easy read, but not a keeper."
3,Interesting but dry,"If you get through it it is very interesting, but you better be ready for some dry academic writing."
1,Worst carrier imagineable,"Tmobile has been nothing but a headache. I signed up because of the fav five program and unlimited text addon availability. I didnt realise you can only USE that in select spots and only on a full moon. Reception is GODAWFUL. God help you if you want to change plans.. or even figure out what plans are available. My behold (phone) is neutered beyond belief when it could have been one of the best phones available. Wish id never left verizon. For the same price i could have gotten pretty much the same deal, incredible reception Everywhere and a much better phone selection. Once this contract is up ill never use tmobile again."
3,T Mobile phone,"great contract with T Mobile, love the service, find its far superior to the company I used before. I am not at all happy with the Dash phone though...it has a bizarre litany of 'apps' and the most useful one I needed the most is the least serviceable. The App for 'phone messages' is just crappy.It does not tell you when calls came in, how many came in and what time on the face of the phone. It does tell you how many EMAILS you have and how many TEXT messages you have but phone messages? nope! Gotta go looking for them and call voice mail to see when or if they come in..its bizarre! Who ever designed this one had online apps on their mind, NOT the fact that its a damn phone!"
1,How Can I Rate It?,"Why should I pay $35.00 and not just change my SIM Card? I am a T-Moble User with an old 7290 Blacberry? I have had an account for 3 years and may have to change carriers if this is not possible as Chris from T-Moble told me on their 800 Line today. I want not to have a contract term, but won't pay a ridiculus premium for the Blackberry."
1,2 year contracts,I am sick of all the contracts cell phone companies are requiring anymore. Why dont they win and keep my business by being the best rather than some mafia way of putting you into a horrible contract.
4,T-Mobile is a good overall,"I had been a Cingular (now AT&T) customer for years and only switched to T-Mobile out of frustration with their poor customer service. I have to say that overall I have been very satisfied with T-Mobile and prefer them over AT&T. The stores are less crowded, the staff is helpful and the rates are reasonable. All cell phone companies are irritating in that you have to sign a contract, you have to pay a lot to get out of the contract and the phone prices (without signing a contract) are astronomical."
1,Tmobile,What can be said about a company who doesn't want to own itself. I have experienced nothing but problems since the AT&T sale fell through. I would recommend Verizon; however check to see which has the best coverage in your area before getting a plan.
5,"Masterpiece of emotions, humanity and cuisine",Fantastic movie with a soft touch. I have recommended this movie to several friends and colleagues and the response has been excellent.
1,thanks shobha,"its a good treatment for INSOMNIA ..... thanks for not bringing out any novels in recent times, i suppose penguin ( and davidar too ) have realised their folly"
2,Sterling blue topaz bangle,"I bought four of these thinking they would be great gifts for several birthdays. They are made OK, however there is no color to the stones. I was disappointed and if I had not been traveling I would have returned them."
2,Not as good as I hoped...,"Honestly, this book simply didn't help me much beyond my intermediate skill level. An absolute beginner won't gain much from this book as the basics just aren't covered that well, and an intermediate tracker will already possess much of the information presented here. There is some good information on how to decipher how old sign is, but this completely ignores the fact that there are so many potentially different environments. (Not every place in the world will have worm castings and spiderwebs to help us gauge the time for example.) The book appears to be aimed at a long-term tracking session, and doesn't seem to consider that there are situations that will take less than a day. If your goal is to learn how to track, or improve your skill level, I would highly recommendTracking : A Blueprint for Learning How, which is much better suited for the non-military trackers."
4,Well ballanced,Like most books on man tracking there was to much focuss on hunting not tracking. Not all tracking is for clossing with the enemy. The book that does apply to the civilian tracker was well ballanced and points well made. This would make a great 1st tracking book.
1,KEEP NORTON DOWN THE MANHOLE!,"""The Honeymooners"" is a very irritating show. Norton is a big mouth who has never learned that a closed mouth gathers no feet. He says many very stupid things and it is curious that this show and the tired lines have had staying power.Ralphie Boy is an annoying, loud mouthed bossy windbag who knows a few cliches and doesn't mind wearing them out further. The worst thing about Ralphie Boy's limited vocabulary is the awful ""hommina."" The ""homminas"" are extremely annoying and contribute nothing of real value.Alice is a big mouth and Trixie is just a shadow figure who can be counted on to cry if crying is called for.""The Honeymooners,"" Norton in particular is about as funny as a stomach virus. ""The Honeymooners"" belong down the manhole with Norton!"
2,Athenais c'est mauvais,"I found this book to be spectacularly unfulfilling. It had neither the depth to be considered as a scholarly work nor the level of characterization for a fictionalized history.The main character remains, throughout the work unknown and undeveloped. Most of the information presented appears to be a fairly standard summation of previous works which is not assisted by the author's tendency to jump erratically from period to period with little regard for continuity.In summary, not a book which could be recommended."
1,unbelievable (one-star for jawdropping shallowness),"Well i do think i've seen it all, tho i never thought i'd see the day where a woman, known in her own time to be, at the very least, manipulative, scheming and cruel, at worst a possible accomplice to murder, lauded and fawned over as some sort of feminist heroine.Athenais de Montespan had nothing likeable about her, certainly no traits to encourage any woman to take her up as role model. She was not misunderstood. She was despicable.The author has, sadly, placed countenance over content; but then again, that is modus operandi in the world of fashion, glam rags et al.The descriptions of Athenais de Montespan in Anne and Serge Golon's ""Angelique"" series (romance novels no less, but well researched) offer better insights than this book, as do previous bios on Montespan.I recommend readings on du Pompadour or Marie-Antoinette instead, the latter of whom was indeed misunderstood."
1,Poorly written,"I purchased this book some time ago and after several attempts to ""get through it"" chalked it up as a sunk cost: Publishers Weekly's review on this web site is generous. However, they do answer the question for me having read it some time ago -- why was that book so impossible to read? The first couple of chapters lead the reader to believe that the book is well-written and interesting. The truth is that Lisa Hilton's writing style is extremely erratic and well, the exact opposite of a 'page turner'. Indeed, I had looked at the excerpt before buying and I'll admit that the opening got me then and again just now as I gave it a quick glance before stringing together this review."
4,Listen To This,"Blender magazine = 1 star. Rolling Stone = 2 stars. Don't always believe what you read.This is another fine album from Derek Trucks and band.It has more of an ""easy"" jazz feel due to the inclusion of flute on just about all the tracks.Don't let that scare you, this cd still rocks.Starts off with the Duane Allman fave Soul Serenade (wish it was longer)and quickly fades to Bob Marley's Rastaman Chant.Gregg Allman makes an appearance on an excellent Drown In My Own Tears.The rest is all jazzy instrumentals featuring flute and Allman Bros. style guitar.Somehow it all works.Don't believe what you read just believe what you hear."
4,First of Derek Trucks that I bought,"And I am/was plesantly surprised. The vocal appearance of Greg Allman was unexpected in this otherwise instrumental effort. This is no typical offering; it belies catagorization, just like I like it. Somewhere between jazz/rock fusion and blues there is the Derek Trucks Band. Derek has a real gift in using the slide; it sounds smooth and unforced. Just glides along... A very good effort."
3,Good background music,"I picked this album up after Pandora played a track (Greg Allman's) on one of my stations. I have always been a fan of the ABB, Trucks/Tedschi and that genre of music.The best way I can describe this album is to relate it to a live concert. Typically when I go to a live show before the main act comes on you hear some back ground music. Then the main act comes on and does their sets, then the show ends and the back ground music starts again.That's how I hear this album. You have some really good background music for the first couple of tracks. Then Greg Allman comes on and lays some great blues backed up by a great band , DT and company. Then the shows over and you go back to the background music.Dont get me wrong, the band is great, but its really just a jam session."
3,Not bad for half an album,"This CD is marginal. It begins with Soul Serenade, based on the version performed by the Allman Brothers thirty years before (available on the 4 disc box set). Derek rips into it after only a minute long buildup.The problem is, the album peaks there, at two minutes in. That's not to say that completely crashes after that, it's kind of like going to DisneyWorld and riding Space Mountain first.The other highlight is a bluesy rock number entitled ""Drown in my own Tears"" featuring Gregg Allman. This easily sounds like it could have been on the Allman's 2003 incredible release, Hittin' the Hote.However, my recommendation is to check out that CD, then Joyful Noise, and then this one.One last interesting note is that these tracks were actually recorded before the band's last CD: Joyful Noise. Also, Gregg's vocal part was recorded on a seperate date from Derek's guitar leads, but they still manage to work well together."
3,A minor disappointment,"Since I quit smoking dope, I have lost my enthusiasm for long drawn-out jam sessions. If you like Phish, Dave Matthews' live albums, the other albums by Blues Traveller besides ""4"", then this is an album for you. I ""discovered"" Derek Trucks as I have discovered many other modern guitar virtuosos by watching the Eric Clapton Guitar Festivals on DVD. I know he can play better songs than these, (too much good weed and magic mushrooms makes a person self indulgent). Get ""Songlines"" instead."
3,This is not your father's Miami Vice.,"Just a warning: If you are thinking about this album because you love Hammer's work on Miami Vice, you will probably be disappointed. This album is a creative mishmash of jazz and new age rock-fusion, and while Hammer's immense talent and distinctive style certainly come through in his early work here, it does not have the revolutionary brilliance of the Vice scoring."
3,poor version,"Even though this book is well written and concise, it is a poor version compared to the small animal compendiums. The layout is unorganised and there are many conditions that are missed. Also there is no drug formulary in the back which was a major advantage of the small animal versions"
3,disappointing,"I was expecting the invaluable resource that the small animal version is, but I agree with other reviewers: it seems very disorganized. It also seems lacking in many pathological conditions that are, as they say, ""not uncommon""...I would rather use the Rose and Hodgson field guide any day..."
2,Not for me,"I guess I'm just a die-hard Hal Lindsey fan because I found myself having bad vibes for the author. I sure hope Lindsey is on the up-and-up, cause I'm with him"
1,A misconceived flop,"Despite all that is praiseworthy about this production--sets, costumes, supporting roles--it misses John Gay's artistic intent by several thousand light years. Gay didn't write just another British working-class grumble about real or fancied oppression by everybody in sight, as this production has it. He crafted a sly, funny dig at the upper classes as aped by the lowest: outcasts, thieves and scalawags. Until Jonathan Miller's ""rehabilitation"" it was a very funny, even romantic, little piece. Anthony Powell, in his autobiography, dwells nostalgically on the charm it cast every time a new production was mounted every 20 years or so. Or at least did cast until this latest--which should finish it for good. It may be politically unimpeachable but artistically it is witless and mendacious.The now unobtainable Olivier version, marred only by Lord Laurence's decision to sing his own part, may well be the last to respect Gay's original intent."
2,Miscast MacHeath,"I agree entirely with the reviewer who said that this version is badly recorded. The words are unintelligible.I have a further criticism. I don't believe the part of MacHeath should be played by a boy in such a foppish, effete manner. MacHeath is a bold highwayman and a charmer of the ladies. This young man could never fit that description.It's a shame that the version of Beggar's Opera with Lawrence Olivier, produced in the 50's or 60's is not available on video."
3,(none),"A very good preduction overall if not slightly 'uncut'...however, all those other reviewers who say that the olivier version has 'disapeared' should try looking on the amazon.co.uk website where it is available on either region 2 dvd or PAL video."
1,Don't expect High Style...,"Don't expect to understand a word of either the songs or the dialogue, unless you have some expertise in comprehending an assortment of inarticulate low-life dialects, enduring assorted varieties of mumbling, and catching lines made inaudible by background music. This film would benefit from having subtitles posted, in John Gay's English.So much about the film is lovely--the settings, the costumes, the music (both vocal and orchestral). The satire would be superb as well, if the actors weren't so concerned with clowning and calling attention to themselves.The production overwhelms the viewer with its attempts to capture the ""realism"" of the bar and the brothel, and the cast seems to believe that the spectators won't get the jokes if they are presented with any subtlety."
4,Sunrise in Cephiro,Hi Rayearth fans! This new movie Sunrise is da bomb(it is dubbed in english)! I totally love this movie. My favorite episode is Ferio-A Romance In The Desert! This is the totally cool 2nd vidio in the series. I can't wait 'till the second Rayearth series comes out!
5,Truls Mork is the best!,"Mork's rendition of the Britten Suites is incredible! His may use a lot of rubato but it sounds good, right? His articulation and intonation is perfect! If you like cello, you'll like this!"
1,bad choice,"This book contains quite outdated information. For example, the CIA exam for each part consists of 100 multiple-choice questions to be completed in 2 hrs and 45 min. But the book states 125 multiple-choice questions in 3 and 1/2 hours.(see Preface) The other problem is that a lot of questions attached to each chapter are not related to the topics the chapter is covered. For example, question 42 to 47 regarding ERM in chapter 3. ERM is actually covered in chapter 5. Things like this really discourage my study motivation and efficiency. DO NOT BUY IT!!!"
3,Not a pleasant reading experience...but I guess it worked,"In short, I passed the CIA in 4 months. This book really could use some improvements especially breaking up the material to make it easier to read. I think in many parts the author went on for many more pages than was necessary. If you look at the back of the book you'll understand that perhaps he was just trying to show off his knowledge of things unrelated to the CIA exam (i.e. manufacturing processes)."
4,Great book...wish there was a follow-up,"Great book, and I'm very glad to own a copy. The downfalls were the style of writing and the introduction, which included a brief 'history' of heavy metal. I would suggest skipping this part and buying a copy of 'Bang Your Head' if you are at all interested in that topic. However, once the author finally gets to the subject of Soundgarden, it's a great book! In my opinion, Chris Cornell is the most talented singer/songwriter out there and it's very cool to learn more about the history of the band. Hopefully someone will pick up where this book left off, as it appears 2010 and beyond will be very eventful for Soundgarden."
5,This is a classic Willie record,"This is probably Willie Nelson's most underrated record. It's also one of his best. The opening track, 'Living In The Promiseland,' is one of his biggest hits, and it's also one of my all-time favorites.Highlights other than the title track include 'I've Got The Craziest Feeling,' 'I'm Not Trying To Forget You,' 'You're Only In My Arms,' and Willie's rendition of 'Bach's Minuet In G.'If you like Willie's 1974 epic 'Red Headed Stranger,' you'll like this 1986 masterpiece. It's one of my favorites, and it's highly recommended. A welcome addition to any Willie collection."
3,"Still haven't received it as of Feb. 22, 2005","According to the emails I'm getting from Amazon, they expect shipment of this binderized version of the Strategy Guide by Mar. 22. I ordered this around end of January. Brady Games must be having some problems with getting it squared away, especially with all the recent WoW patches that Blizzard has released (currently at version 1.2.3). The funny thing is that the whole reason for this Limited Edition Binder Version is that you can download updated pages in a PDF format directly from www.bradygames.com. I've seen some of the PDF updates, and while nice, it also suffers the same problem that the regular strategy guide has... the text is extremely small. Maybe they are reworking the whole binder thing to accommadate larger text. We'll see. I'll update this review once I get my guide."
5,Good Guide,"This is a really good Strategy Guide, it gives you maps and tons of info that helps you on your journeys across Azeroth. If you have played in the Beta or Open Beta though, I wouldn't recommend getting it, because you have probably already seen most of the game anyway :)."
3,very subtle,"This is very much a matter of personal taste. Schiff plays splendidly, without doubt, but personally I rather listen to the more passionate interpretation of Rostropovich, or the baroque melancholy of Bijlsma"
4,All you get,"that's the song I knew by The Red Hot Valentines, ""All you get"" was on some pop punk compilation CD from far before I bought this CD, I listened to that song ad nauseum, so I decided I needed to buy the full length album. Best record ever? even the best pop punk record ever? no, but when you're looking for something simple and reasonable, it's where to go."
2,CHEATING THE ODDS?,"From Poets & Writers...""Don Judson (Letters, January/February 2002) is disturbed by the teacher/student relationship in the Paris Review Prize contest (""How Priscilla Becker Beat the Odds"" by Joanna Smith Rakoff, November/December 2001). He wonders whether or not Richard Howard may have recognized Priscilla Becker's poetry. If not, Howard has a short memory. A year before the contest deadline, he published three of Priscilla Becker's poems in the Paris Review. A few months later Howard published more of her work in the Western Humanities Review. Then, just a few months before the contest deadline, he published Becker a third time (again in the Paris Review). Prior to the Paris Review Prize contest, Richard Howard was, in fact, the only editor to have published Priscilla Becker's poetry."
2,Pepsi Challenge,Ms Becker has gotten a lot of praise lately. This praise is neither sincere nor has merit. She doesn't have much to say and what she does say is said poorly. Stack her up against real talent like Todd Moore or Charles Bukowski and you will see how that praise that has been given her is so undeserved.
4,A very exotic story,"The story takes you from the exotic land of Malta to the rough and strange lands of Tunisia, where the heroine, Charlotte is taken as a slave and pretty much passed around and abused terribly. But of course, since this is erotic FANTASY, she likes it. This is an adventurous story and very fun and engaging to read. I have read a few books in the Chimera publishing line and this is the best one by far."
1,horrific.,"I am surprised that something of this nature can be published. I am no prude, but it's rape, bestiality, torture, shallow characters... just absolutely awful. This is the first review I have ever written but I wish I had known better before buying this."
4,Cute book,"My 2 yr old enjoyed this on a recent plane trip,,,cute illustrations and fun to do together! Stories are cute as well!"
1,defective plastic product,"I bought the WaterPik SM-651 for $25 at a hardware store 2 days ago and installed it last night. There were a few leaks in the equipment, and not because of a faulty seal where it's attached to the pipe. There is a pivot joint on the mounting bracket, that allows you to reposition the showerhead when stationary. A leak sprayed out of this joint when I moved the showerhead to a vertical/overhead position. Also, there were a few spots on the spray nozzle where it just dribbled down, instead of spraying forward. Lastly, there was a slow leak right behind the spray setting dial. I'm returning this WaterPik Shower Massage today for a refund, hence the one star rating."
2,Poor quality and battery life,Charged for 8+ hours before inital use. Battry life reported to be 250 standby and 4 talk hours. Battery died after 24 and was only used in talk mode for less than 1 hr. Recaharged for 8 more hours and same thing happend. It also hurt my ear after wearing only a shor time. I found sound quality to be good and easy to connect to phone.
1,Do not buy this device,"After charging overnight,this device still only runs for approx. 4 hours.Though I can hear others, everyone I talk to using the device asks where I am and complains of sounds of breaking up or a whirring/buzzing noise. Everyone has asked me to please not call using this device. I wish I'd taken time to read more reviews before purchasing!"
2,Connectivity Issues,Not good connection. The connection breaks in between calls which is very irritating. The logitech should do a better job.
2,Bulky,"Did the job well enough. Of course it's very old now, but I would still let my little kid use it."
3,"Lowest Bluetooth headset, but has its problems","This is the lowest priced Bluetooth headset I was able to find on Amazon at about 13 dollars shipping included. However, this is not the best quality headset as far as functionality goes. For starters, this item has no instruction manual. There only is a ""Quick start guide"" available that doesn't go into detail on how to use the headset.[...]The headset has a good volume level, but it's main downfall is the microphone. It just simply does not pick up your voice loud enough. I have found myself talking very loud or using my hand to direct my voice.In conclusion, if it weren't for the microphone, this would be a very good Bluetooth headset. I would recommend spending a little more to buy a better quality device."
1,Horrible sound,"Problem: The microphone sits against your face, and rubs on your cheek when you talk. My wife and I both had the same problem. We could not get the unit to pick up our voices clearly. No one could understand us when using it.Battery life was not very good either. I wish I hadn't bought it."
3,good buy,this was a good buy i just can't get used to the part that sticks in my earso if u don't like anything in your ear this is not for you
2,Ok but not very good,"I first received a faulty piece. Thanks to Amazon, I got it replaced free of cost.Pros - Light weight- you can wear it for long time- very smart lookingCons- poor battery life- sometimes it gets very dificult to connect- disconnects by itself- not good to use near a microwave oven- As soon as I connect a call - the voice goes to minimum automatically, then I have to first increase the voulume from this bluetooth and then from my mobile handset.Conclusion: I bought it because I was getting it for a deal, however I may go for another one if the problem persists"
3,Good headset for the price,"(...)This is the first headset I've owned. It paired easily with my T-Mobile Sony-Ericsson T610 phone. Voice dialing works as it should.It doesn't stay on my ear very well, but this is probably me getting used to having a headset. It feels somewhat flimsy, but it is not heavy so that's probably a fair tradeoff.It only has two buttons which perform all functions. There is a delay between when the button is pressed and the phone responds. This could be my phone.It would be nice to have a caller-id display, but this headset does not have that.(...). I would have been disappointed if I spent more than $20 for it."
5,Good for the price.,I paid $29.99 for this a couple weeks ago. (I'm a sucker for cheap headsets).Pros:- The fit is great in my ear.- The clarity and volume are on par with other headsets in this price range. The trick is getting the phone volume right. Once you do this the sound quality is much better.- Good battery life.- Pairs right up with my phone.Cons:- It took a while to adjust the volume to my liking.- The box it comes in is huge.
3,Logitec Headset,"I picked this unit because it has an ear bud that fits in your ear, versus just putting a small speaker outside the ear. Ironically though, it does not do well in loud environments. I wish it had a louder volume level.The unit is light and easy on the ear, and the buttons are easy enough to operate. It paired easily with my Treo 650. Everyone I have spoken to with this has reported good voice quality and volume.Suggestion:Rework the charger port. I lost the end cap covering the port in the first three minutes I owned the headset. At least tether it somehow."
2,It is bad no matter how much it is,"The person on the other side can't hear you well and you have to keep repeating yourself, so I don't care how cheap it is or even free, it is not usable. Check out the Plantronics headsets instead."
2,Has its weaknesses. here they are:,"Stupid audio quality, doesnt work one room away from the brand new Moto Q. You constantly have to push a button for 10 seconds to sync. Thats a little nuts. Battery life is not impressive."
3,Good Headset,Easy to use. But the other person on the phone keep telling me that your voice is breaking. I am not sure this happens in all the Bluetooth headset. When I am in the Room then I could hear clearly and even the other person in the phone also hears properly.Senthil
4,Ok,"This bluetooth was ok for the price. Initially it worked great...good reception, clarity and battery life. But after using it for a couple of weeks everything started deteriorating. One of my gripes is that it doesn't fit in the ear very well. I found myself having to constantly push it back onto my ear every few minutes. You definitely get what you pay for. But as an introduction into the bluetooth headsets it's great."
1,Nice design and price but a poor performance,"I bought this headset as a present for my boyfriend to use it for VOIP with a bluetooth dongle and a notebook. I called him three times when he used it and after that I gave him the advice to return. The acoustic transmission for him was okay and I could hear his voice, too. But I and others who called him heard also a very annoying hissing while the call. He sent it back and uses his old his headset with cables again...unfortunately only 1 star."
2,"Cheap, Effective?","I only use this when I'm driving, so I'm not fiddling with the shoulder-neck hold. Inexpensive at the time of purchase, but the soft ear piece is easily lost. It's really comfortable, but the sound quality is poor. I tend to switch back to the handset whenever I have an important call, because the static and low volume really muffle the call.Not a bad buy, but I'd recommend a higher quality. ""You get what you pay for"" certainly applies here."
2,Not worth it,"The look, the feel and the weight was perfect. But the sound quality was horrible. I couldn't hear anyone, No one could hear me and if they did there was nothing but high pitched static. It was embarassing to speak to clients on it. I returned it immediatley."
2,not even worth the price,"The headset works, but it is crackly, tinny, and ""sounds like you're in a tunnel."" Get the more expensive models, you'll end up getting one anyway!"
5,Excellent purchase!,The microphone is excellent at picking what I'm saying and the range of the signal is great.
2,Nice Package - Questionable Contents,"I was excited to find a sub $40 blue tooth headset...especially from a brand name like Logitech. I have several of their other products and have been quite happy with them as an organization. Although it will take more than one bad experience to turn from Logitech, this purchase left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth.The functionality is great. Pairs extremely well with my LG VX8100 from Verizon. However, the sound and mic quality are poor. The headset often has difficulty recognizing commands, especially the ""YES"" command. Frustrating to say the least. I also have had several complaints about the sound quality, from ""you sound muffled"" to ""you sound like you are at the end of a tunnel"".Unfortunately, I am outside the return policy. If I wasn't traveling so much I would have returned it."
2,just a toy,"Cons:1. The sound quality is so poor2. Have to speak very loudly when using my cell phone3. Takes time to get paired up with other devicesPros:it works anyway, with my T-610 cell phone, my pda and my computerif you just want a toy, it's fine; if you want something more, forget about it."
1,"Poor design, quality, and service","Quality:The first version I bought from best buy would not enter pairing mode. The replacement paired with my blackberry after a few attempts.Service:Customer service at Logitech was less than informed or helpful with the pairing problem.Design:Notice the pictures do not highlight the earpiece. It has a plastic cover that is easily scratched and peeled off the underlying speaker component. If you plan to put the headset in your pocket when not using it, you have to treat it like a fragile piece of jewelry, i.e., wrap it up or put it in a case. Otherwise, the earpiece cover will quickly be damaged and fall off.Returning the second one was difficult since a month had passed when the earpiece cover ripped off. Again, Logitech customer service provided little to no assistance.I highly recommend any brand but Logitech for your next headset. Good luck."
2,not comfortable,i did not find this headset comfortable as it would cause my ear to ache after a while. buttons are also small and very close together so hard to figure out by touch which is which.
1,Travesty,"I should have read the reviews on Amazon UK before buying this. The transfer looks like Renoir's THE RIVER. Early color, everything distorted. No amount of tinkering with your video settings can make it look good. If you know how the movie should look, this DVD is unbearable.Wait for the Region 1. Do not buy this!"
3,Flawed movie of a great book,"L. P. Hartley's book of the love between an upper class woman and a local farmer is a good story, enhanced by the appealing character of the young boy who's a house guest at the English country estate where the action takes place, who unwittingly gets involved as the message-carrier, hence ""go-between.""Although the movie was popular when it was first released, with the distance of time, it's less satisfying. It's set as a flash-back from the boy's adulthood, and it took me three times before I could figure out that the now-80-year-old lady was supposed to be an aged Julie Christie. The framing device didn't work.A bigger problem for this version is that the transfer to VHS is crude--quite blurry at times. As other reviewers have said, too bad the studio couldn't go back to the original negative and give us a decent DVD. With all it's flaws, this movie is still worth watching."
3,Surprisingly slack,"I first saw this film at 9 years, when it went completely over my head. Later, I stumbled on the novel and was wowed. Well, quietly wowed. In my second viewing of the adaptation, I found it oddly weak, given the directing, writing, and acting talent involved.This movie should bristle with underlying tension, but despite the efforts of Michel Legrand's score, which booms in now and then with a foreboding motif, much of the film just wanders along. The climactic scenes *do* allow Margaret Leighton as the matriarch to steam over with grand messiness, but why--to take one example--is the scene where Julie Christie loses her temper with the young Leo so stagey and lame?Julie actually resorts to that cliche: wringing her hands while pacing to convey ""distress.""Read the book. Or rent Losey/Pinter's previous effort, The Servant. No shortage of tension there."
2,Go Between - Go Away,"The movie is about a boy (played by Dominic Guard) who finds himself used by a rich girl and a stablehand in their desire to have a romantic affair, and how it winds up traumitizing him.Well the movie has its points, it gets bogged down and leaves too much to the viewer to figure out.I cheated - I eventually read the book.Cute kids does not a good movie make!!!"
2,BG-Sextet Best is vinyl CL-652mono,"Once again the CopyRight holder/s have NOT included the original CL-652 mono performances as originally released on Columbia vinyl LP CL-652. That is THE classic American Jazz vinyl, featuring Charlie Christian (at his improvisational BEST), Lionel Hampton, Count Basie, Gene Krupa, Cootie Williams, arrangements and score-charts by Fletcher Henderson, who is featured on piano...."
5,Oh Please,"I saw the poop clips on the Limp bizkit site and it looks funny as hell! If you Dont Have both cds, go to limp bizkit concerts then dont get this video, cuz this is for good fans not posin folks who only listen to the cover songs!"
5,Playskool Triple Race Tower,"I love this product! Super-fun for children ages 2-3 years! It has great sound effects and the child it was bought for, loves it!"
1,won't stay together,"My 18 month old really WANTS to play with this toy, but the tracks won't stay together long enough for him to enjoy it. I have to CONSTANTLY reattach the tracks on top and bottom. IF he doesn't touch the tracks at all, it works fine. But as soon as he bumps it, or tries to move it everything falls apart. My sister, however, has this toy for her son and have never had any problems with the assembly failing. Had I known sooner, I definitely would have exchanged it for a new one. Too late now."
3,Kind of a snoozer...,"I got this for my 18mo son last Christmas. And, he's probably played with it 5 times all year. The cars are cute...he has carried them around, but prefers the Disney Pixar Cars. The race is so quick, it rarely keeps the attention of either of my kids (2 & 3.5yo) for very long. Cute idea, but not a winner in this house. Can't beat the price though... :)"
1,Don't waste your money.,"This toy is very flimsy, it never stayed together long enough to do one single race. I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want a lot of frustration. Not worth it at all."
2,Fun while it lasted,This toy is really cute and once we got it home I assembled it and he completly loved it. He was arranging the trucks by color and pushing the button and watching them roll down the tracks. Then he tried to move it and the whole track fell apart because where the tracks snap in at the top and the bottom do not hold. After putting it together multiple times I decided to try supergule the tracks to the bases. While this did keep the toy assembled for awhile it broke the launching mechanism. My 2 year old still enjoyed it (although not as much) for about the next couple of weeks until he broke the super glue bond and I just tossed the track out. Since we picked this toy up for $10 on Clearance I gave it a 2 star since he still has and likes the trucks which this toy came with and it would have cost us the $10 to but just the little trucks I am sure.
3,Kids have more fun pulling it apart,"It's not a bad toy for the money. My 2 boys 3 & 1.5 will play with it for a moment (if it's put together) then they'll pull off all the ramps and flags & end connector. When I pick up toys, this toy is always in at least 2 different rooms. But they are interested again when it's back together."
2,Kids love it but....,it doesn't stay together. The tracks continuously fall off the base and the top so it's completely useless. We finally trashed it which is unfortunate because the kids always wanted to play with it. Very disappointing.
2,I wish it was more durable,"My son has pretty much every one of these sets. They all have the same problem, great idea, poor quality. It doesn't seem to bother my son, as much as it does me. This is because I think he has just as much fun saying, ""Broken Mommy"" as he shoves one of the tracks in my face for me to fix it. Most recently the red part broke off of it. Being a boy, he has found lots of uses for the parts, and doesn't seem to care that it doesn't hold up very well. I suppose that is the most important part.Having said that about the set, the cars that come with it are amazing, and he uses them all the time. We have just about all the packs of cars, and they go on all the different sets (whenever we have ""fixed"" them). We have superglued other sets, and it just didn't help."
2,cheap,I just threw this toy away because I was sick and tired of putting it back together all the time. The three tracks never stay attached to the tall base or the bottom piece.
3,Disappointed,"Item delivered is not the same item pictured. We did not receive the bonus vehicles pictured. We ordered from Amazon because the three extra vehicles made this the best deal. Notified Amazon, but have yet to receive a reply. Grandchild is disappointed. So sad!"
2,Kinda Lame,"This toy is pretty simple, my 2 year old has really only played with a few times. He spends more time taking it apart than actually playing with it as intended."
3,Completely Overpriced and Flimsy...,"This toy was bought for my now 15 month old son months ago. I'm so glad it wasn't me who paid $35 for this. The only time he goes near this is to tear it apart.I've tried sitting with him and showing him how to race the cars down the track, to push the button for the platforms to lift, but he couldn't care less. He pulls off the snap-on platforms for the cars, and for some reason, has developed an intense dislike for the blue track. He always rips it from the unit and pushes it under the couch. He does like the cars though, he plays with them fairly often on their own.Overall, I can't say I'd recommend this, though it absolutely depends on the child. I see many reviewers here whose children loved this...unfortunately mine just didn't take to it. I also feel it's a bit pricey for what you get and how little it does."
4,This is way overpriced!,I bought this for my son at Walmart for $15.77. Way to go Amazon living the American dream!! But during the holidays?? How sick can you get?
3,I've seen better.,"I bought this DVD, in hopes of getting good quality rips of t.A.T.u. music videos. However, the internet contains better quality versions of these videos. The dimensions are 352x264... It's pretty small. The video's audio is noticeably more quiet than the menu audio. The behind-the-scenes featurettes are pretty cool, but, it doesn't make up for it. Don't get me wrong, when I got this DVD, I was super-stoked, and I still am, but that's probably due to my insatiable thirst for t.A.T.u. I personally collect, or hope to start collecting, and even I'm a little let down. The Russian tracks (Ya Soshla S Uma and Nas Ne Dogonyat) use the 200 km/h In The Wrong Lane arrangements, and both All The Things She Said and Ya Soshla S Uma use the radio edits. Also, the ATTSS remix is much shorter than the one used everywhere else. All that aside, it's a decent DVD. A must-have for any fan (it features the OFFICIAL 30 Minutes video), despite it's flaws."
1,Idiotism,"Their music sucks, always, listen to something much more decent as Michael Jackson for instance, but don't spend money and your precious time on this, as some to my surprise even call it music, when it is just a piece of garbage!"
3,"Same thing, different packaging from EA","They could have done better with this one. Unfortunately you will get bored with it after few days since the only interesting thing is competing for the TREBLE. You have to create your own Champions League tables and the stadia are randomly chosen for you. The Final is not even in Athens...Commentary is ""stupid"" and out of context : you score and the commentators would say ""that is a corner, now what can they do with it"" and also the away goal rule does not apply so you would play extra time regardless of the away goals in a tie score. It seems that they rushed this release and still got it late and half finished! As a Tottenham supporter it is even more frustrating that after years and years of Fifa/Uefa releases White Hart Lane is not featured! and they included the Emirates. Shame on you EA. Lets hope Fifa 09 is an improvement!"
3,Dissapointing,"After his first six novels, this is a letdown.I absolutely loved the investigations into ethics/morality in Hemry's first 6 books. This book however, just tells the story of a court martial. There are no real ""hard"" decisions from the characters. Still a decent read though."
1,against all enemies,i like john's writing ..but he needs to have someone monitor the nincompoops @ amazon/publishers because mass market paper back for $330.00- upwards ???? anyone on drugs - prescribed or otherwise ??? ... signed hardcover editions that are more than 352 pages ..qualify !!! this is utter rot.....eric b.
5,Excellent music and visuals,"We were given this video when my son was born and we started playing it for him when he was only 2 months old. He is now 2 1/2 years old and he still asks to watch ""colors"" quite often. Not only that, he actually can hum the music and calls them by the color that they are played to! Sometimes he asks me to sing ""the blue song or green song"" when I brush his teeth and I have to ask him how a particular piece begins. It always amazes our friends and family that he can actually hum these classical music pieces."
1,HORRIBLE VIDEO -- DOWNRIGHT SPOOKY AND POOR AUDIO,I am quite surprised by the other reviews here that say how much they like this video. I have bought a lot of videos for my 6 month old twins ranging from Baby Mozart to Winnie the Pooh to the So SMart series to Sesame Street and this is by FAR the worst video. The only good part is the opening with the fireworks display. The rest of it is downright creepy with bizzare alien looking blobs of colors and strange almost Mars-like backgrounds. The audio of classical music sounds tinny and is very poor quality. All the dripping blobs of color and flying weird shapes just totally creeped my husband and I out. My twins -- who love the other videos mentioned -- barely gave it a second glance. I turned it off and they instead watched Baby Mozart . . .
2,Disappointed,We bought this for our daughter who absolutely loves the Baby Mozart video. Unfortunately this video does not interest her in the least.
3,Change of Heart,"I wrote a pretty negative review about a year ago on this video, saying that no child under 3 years would want to watch it. Well, my son is now 15 months and he seems to really love it - so I guess Momma is going to have to eat humble pie. He starts dancing and marching to the Turkish March, and follows the animation to Bocharini with his finger. We are using the visuals to teach color words. He enjoys the video much more than the same musical selections from a CD. It seems to have become a good buy after all."
3,Beware - not like the other ABC and 123 videos,"I must admit that this video is well done and uses a great deal of imagination to portray colors. The problem for me is that there are no children (like in the other videos) repeating or even mentioning the colors. THis vidoe is for parents who can sit next to their child and tell him or her constantly what is going on; otherwise, the child does not learn the colors."
1,Bad Screen Savers,"I bought this video for my 11 month old grandson. His parents and I were starting to get bored watching his other videos, like the Einstein series and some others, so we thought we would expand our horizons. What a disappointment! The first time we sat down at Grandma's house to watch our new video, both he and I were excited but it didn't even keep his (or my) attention for a minute. Very boring, very repetitive. There's no way this video can keep an alert child under two's attention. I suggest you buy a good classical music CD and turn on your screensaver."
5,Wonderful experience for all!,We have loved this dvd for over than 10 years with the 2 kids in our house. We started playing it right after they were born. It has provided joy of classical music along with learning and knowing the colors of the rainbow. I highly recommend this for your kids and grandkids to come. You can't go wrong..
5,Response to viewer,"I just noticed the review that said that this video is not appropriate for children under three and I have to completely disagree. I have a 6 month old, a two year old and a four year old and this is the only video I have ever found (including Baby Mozart, So Smart) that all three of my kids will watch together. It is amazing. I would strongly recommend it to anyone with a child between the ages of 6 months & 4 years."
2,The Early Conception of Legends,"An interesting glimpse into Deep Dish's earlier beginnings is back on the shelves. Penetrate Deeper is definitely not for electronica fans that love Deep Dish's 21st century work. This album is solidly house minus any ""progressiveness"". Not surprising, as the original release date is three years prior to the unofficial induction of the progressive subgenre of house music.The album is fun and happy, but lacks depth. Deep Dish tend to overuse their featured vocalists on their own albums. Penetrate Deeper is no exception.There are only a handful of old electronica albums that warrant re-releases. This is not one of them.2.5/5 stars."
2,Not quite what I expected,I normally buy any Deep Dish release without reading the reveiws or listening to it first. This definitley sounds older and I was expecting a little more. Maybe a good one for serious DD fans but I prefer their newer stuff (Global Underground).
4,good flick,This is an above average independent flick. Takes place in New York City. Black guy from hood and white guy from clubs have to work together. The two leads do a good job in pulling off that Training Day - Ethan/Denzel vibe. I thought the first few scencs were a little weak and Reakwon doesn't have that big of a part. Overall the film has some funny parts and keeps you entertained.
2,Page size is too small,Edward Weston was one of the great masters of photography. However the size of reproductions in this book is too small and the quality of prints is not good enough to do justice to his photographic style which depended on precision and detail for its effect. You are better off viewing the photos off the Internet on your computer monitor. The accompanying text is mostly a factual biography. Do not buy.
4,ambitious and comprehensive,"I bought this set because I was looking for early Dvorak, which is surprisingly difficult to find. As a collection of such hard-to-find material, this set of recordings is fabulous. I am already enamored of the fourth, listening to it over and over. The more I listen to this set of CDs, the more I like it. The technical quality of the playing, though overall not quite up to the level of the top world-class orchestras, is nonetheless excellent and in many ways more authentic of Dvorak and his world -- plus there are some really strong performances especially on the woodwind side."
3,"Decent, but not interview worthy","This is a nice writing surface, but it's obviously made of vinyl. It would look cheesy next to a suit; not a good idea for interviews."
5,A portfolio of techniques to buy real estate w/o cash,This book was very helpful to me when I first started becuase I didn't have either cash or credit. WADE offers a portfolio of 101 techniques to buy real estate with little or none of your own money.
2,"far fetched, and not that possible for the average guy",this book is nothing more then a bunch of negoating tips. some info. is good but if you are seriously interested in a book that gives great information this is not it. if you buy it cheap you will get your moneys worth but the book is all about unreal negoating that 99% of the world would say NO to. sorry i would not buy it if i knew it was going to be like this save your money!
1,101 Ways to Restate the Same Idea Over and Over,"In this book, Wade B. Cook gives one (1) way to buy a house, and tells 101 variations of this story: find a house for sale at $52,000, assume the first mortgage, get the owner to carry back a second, and pay off the second at 1% per month.He completely oversimplifies this process. His examples are very dated based on his home prices (all in the 48,000 - 62,000 range); and the kind of decisions his example bankers make haven't happened since before the S&L scandal. All in all, this book was a complete waste of time."
3,Real-Estate Deals That Don't Really Exist in the Real World,"In his book Mr. Wade B. Cook gives only one way to buy a house, and then tells 101 variations of this story. And the 101 little stories ""explains"" how to use Mr. Wade's creative real-estate finance techniques. It's not 101 ways to buy real estate, it's 101 variations on a single theme: find a seller who has an assumable mortgage on his or her property and convince that seller to let you assume the mortgage and give the seller ""payments"" for his or her equity.This book is nothing more than a collection of negotiating tips. Reading the book has made you think about different ways to negotiate with real estate sellers. Some information is good but Mr. Wade oversimplifies the buying process. So if you are seriously interested in a book that gives great information this is not it."
1,Real Estate From Mr. Flim Flam,I enjoyed his stock book 2 down years and up in #3. The Third year was 2002 which was one of the worst years on Wall Street. Wade Cook should go back to driving a cab.
3,slipknot spiked mask,purchased for my son. Expected it to fit a little better. He was happy overall.
3,Not like the picture,"The picture shows a fairly detailed amount of shading with the colors. HOWEVER, the shading is achieved by BLENDING -- with PENCILS. There are only 10 (yes ten) colored pencils total and a grey and black short pencil. There is ONLY ONE BROWN Pencil, there is NO white pencil to blend ... Look at the horse... How does a 10 year old manage to replicate that degree of shading with one brown pencil. ?? This is NOT WHAT I THOUGHT... this is more of a dollar tree item than the 4.79 asked by the seller. I am disappointed."
4,eh,Not a top notch package it was broken :\ but luckily the dvd was just fine. The production is not up to date but that's just fine with me.
2,It's just ok,"I like the face of the watch, but the rest of it is not well made. The band is flimsy. Overall, it's just ok."
4,Simple everyday casual.,This is a very simple and basic watch. Looks nice and feels nice. Leather strap.
5,Lorus Women's pink strap watch Seiko brand,The watch came in excellent condition. It fits real cute on my hand . It is quite fashionable and has never gone off time. I wear it everywhere. In short it is absolutely perfect for women with a sense of fashion. I Highly recommend it.
3,Stylish but more pink than the picture shows,"It's pretty nice watch. I wish they have more colors to choose from though. The pink kinda make me regret it, but the style and the price is good."
2,only stripping,"if you like a strip tease, get this.. im only writing this review yo let others know that this is only stripping.."
1,Welcome to Peach Island,This movie was not what I would exspect from a Peach production. Yes the girls where attractive but if I wanted to watch music videos with stripping I would have went to a club
4,Whoa baby,"Whoa... These women are seriously hot(Well, most of them anyway).Teanna Kai and another young lady on the beach who appeared to be Pacific Asian Islander where the two most attractive. A very nice video. Classy, First rate, visually superior(Get my drift?). Extremely pleased. Can't give it a 5 because that would mean it was perfect. It wasn't perfect but it was pretty close."
1,Worst Book Ever Written!,"I tried to read this book twice for High School English, and both times I could get no farther than the 9th chapter. It is supposed to be this great romantic suspense novel, and yet there was no romance or suspense whatsoever. Instead there was a creepy old house and an evil housekeeper, and maybe if it was written by Stephen King it would be as good as it sounds."
1,Ho Ho Horrible,"Nothing merry here - one of the worst Christmas/Mystery/Cozies I have come upon, this story deals with a murder in a ballroom dance competition in Atlantic city, with the main character being a part of a dance troup. While the premise sounds fun and interesting, believe me - it is not. Too many characters pour into the first chapter and by the final page I cared not one bit for any of them - there was no realism and no character development. Language is strong, backstabbing is laced throughout the book, the Christmas part is limited to a study of the tacky decorations in an Atlantic City casino. There is not a bit of charm, cleverness, or grace - ballroom dancers are represented as toupee wearing, shallow and out of touch, with partners frequently betraying each other. If you look are looking for a bright and cheerful Christmas cozy, look elsewhere.-Mamalinda"
3,"Nice to have, but at a price","I ordered this battery so I could have a backup for my iPaq while travelling. It's the exact same battery that is included with the 5455. Unfortunately, it carries a hefty price tag and also some ridiculous packaging. Typical of most accessories, this battery comes sealed in molded plastic--the kind that allows it to be displayed in stores, but completely deters theft. The package was sealed so tightly with such thick plastic that I felt like I was performing serious surgery in order to extract the battery. In the process, the metal cover (wedged so tightly into the plastic) was slightly bent and required another 15 minutes of finessing to reattach it to the battery. Aside from the price and packaging, the unit performs as expected."
4,Fast releif,The directions are simple and the effect are within minutes. It does not have any side effects which is important for this medication.
5,Works Better than anything else I've tried,"Having suffered from acid reflux for years, I had basically given up on Tums, Gaviscon, Omeprezole and other over the counter and prescription drugs. Even when changing my eating habits, they just didn't work for the long-term. Out of desperation I went to my local health food store and was told to try a regimen of Apple Cider Vinegar, Honey and water twice a day and to use Reflux-Away when an acid reflux attack would occur due eating too much or eating the wrong foods. I am very glad to say that their advise really works. The Apple Cider Vinegar/Honey drink is a good maintenance regimen and Reflux -Away works when an attack occurs. Yes, there is a slight after taste and some burping that can occur but it is a small price to pay for the relief that it brings. The more I read about the long-term acid suppressor drugs like Omeprezole, the more concerned I became and am glad that I found and alternate regimen that really works"
4,My husband likes it.,"I wouldn't say it's the best remedy for heartburn and acid-reflux, but when I bought this product for my husband and he started using it, it seemed to ease the heartburn he occasionally gets from certain type of foods. The main is it's a natural product, and we're giving it time, unlike the chemical products that give instant relief. I'm for natural!"
2,would not buy again,i am very much into natural remidies but this product did not meet my needs or expections. however one can always try.
1,Not very well Done!,I did not find this book that well done. There were no captions to tell which countries the models were from and I did not find the photography up to the mark. I have seen much better magazine work done in Asia. The photographer had such a Fantastic subject matter and did not capitalize on it.
1,The Conspiracy is a Conspiracy.,A paperback book that costs $800!!?!?!? Seems that in itself must be a conspiracy. What do you think?
2,abandonment of settlements and regions:ethnoarchaeological,Abandonment of settlment and Regions:Ethnoarchaeological and Archaeological approaches.Please get me this book information.
4,Finally available,"I was first exposed to John Williamson's music 12 years ago now and had worn out all of my tapes. It was good to see a CD available again that had some of the old titles I remembered (True Blue, Galleries of Pink Gallahs,...). A very nice CD for those who want to re-visit Australia through some wonderful musical pictures. He sings like an Australia proud of his country and the land in which he lives. To get a feel for that country, beyond what most tourist will ever see listen to this CD."
5,The definitive guide to spy movies!,"Forget the previous customer review, and check out what the book critics and film historians think -- this book is the best single resource for spy films released in America. It's also one of the funniest film books I've ever read -- I can't wait for his next book. The credits are more complete than other film sources, the photos are fascinating, and the author's comments are really helpful -- and again, hysterical. Should be in every film lover's library!"
4,A Most Enjoyable Read,A Fascinating Journey into the life of one of South Florida's most interesting pioneers. I thought that the book was very educational and opened up a mysterious man's life for other's to enjoy.
4,"Like Vanessa Mae?, then you'll love Taro Hakase","Like that better known violinist, Taro Hakase is an accomplished and experimental player. Unlike V.M. though, who seems to be concentrating on classical, Taro has focused on modern interpretive violin pieces. Some of the covers he does here were not even original Violin pieces - 'Oye como va' for instance. This is not trance music or acid jazz but simply a nice blend of sounds. There is a certain Latin and Middle East feel and atmosphere to the album. The vocals (not his), where used, are lovely but the enjoyment is in the instrumental arrangements which overlay or highlight his splendid electric violin. The pieces I liked best were 'Begin the Beguine' 'Sunrise' which actually gives me the feel of the end of a lazy day and should be called Sunset, and 'Oye Como va'"
3,"Good, but there are better songs that should be included..","I'm a big fan of the old school rap artists, particularly Kurtis Blow. I believe that his record ""Ego Trip"" should be rereleased on CD. I've been trying to find the song ""Under Fire"", which just blew me away when I heard it. I love all the songs on this CD, but Ego Trip is something special. If all the old school music could be rereleased on CD, somebody would be making a lot of money. Kashif has just rereleased his 1983 album on CD, and there is no where else that sells it except his website. So get busy!"
2,Not what I thought I ordered,"I ordered through Amazon this circuit breaker for my boat. I used Amazon because I wanted a circuit breaker with a black switch to match the color of the other switches on my breaker panel, a color unavailable through my local boating stores. When I saw the advertised breaker on Amazon it had a black switch in the picture; however, when it arrived the switch was white. I ended up painting it black but it would have been nice to received what I thought I had ordered."
3,Do not buy this PRINTER,"Along with numerous others, I have been unable to get a promised 300 pages per cartridge (more like 100). Due to the high cartridge ... and nor being able to refill I recommend that you not buy this model. I previously owned a Epson Stylus Color 640 and had great experience. Buy a printer with cartridges that you can refill!!! Epson 777 is definitely not one of them.To give Epson credit - their quality has been superb with the 2 printers I owned over 5 years."
4,"Great quality, but expensive to use!","The Epson Stylus cartridge for the 777 printer gives great printing quality, but it is an expensive way to print every day. I recommend checking into one of the other printers in the Epson line and chosing one that provides a generic cartridge to replace the exisiting Epson brand. It is much more economical in the long run!"
3,"Good ink cartridge but expensive, difficult to find locally","This ink cartridge does not have a generic brand so it is expensive and very difficult to find locally because the local computer and electronic stores can't keep up with the demand. The claim of printing more than 300 pages/cartridge is not true. I ran out of ink after 110 pages and had a tough time looking for the cartridge and finally found it here. If I only read the previous reviews, I would not have bought this printer."
1,This printer and ink stinks,"I bought the 777i about a year ago and have had to refill the ink about 5 times. I definitely do not get the 300 pages it's supposed to do, more like 40-50. Yes I've tried different ways to get by-but the fact is that this printer and ink stink. I will not be purchasing another printer from the clowns at Epson. I advise you to seriously look at any other brand on the face of the planet."
3,What You Should Know,"My printer came with my Home Internet Appliance, so I didn't ""CHOOSE"" it. I think Epson sells their printers at reasonable prices, and then make their money on the cartridges. As everyone else has stated, their cartridges do not print as many pages as promised."
3,misleading,"The print is beautiful--but the epson 777 I originally bought developed a problem. I contacted epson - and was sent a remanufactured model (the same). Immediately problems surfaced. I again contacted epson; they sent me a new one. Not too long after I developed the same problem- the printer stop printing. I assumed it was the ink cartridge but they said I should print over 300 pages per cartridge--that is not so. I'm now reduced to buying not only the black ink cartridge but also the color as one doesn't work without the other!! The other thing I didn't appreciate is that I wanted to return this epson for a refund--but I can't find my receipt-no receipt no refund. How was I suppose to know I would have such problems with such a ""super printer""? I'm in the market for another printer--any suggestions...."
2,Meh,"These clip-ons work ok, but they fall off easily, get smudged easily, and flip down all on their own when I want them up, and they do it all the time, to the point of being very tedious and annoying. The shading of the lenses was nice, but in the end, it just proved to me more trouble than its worth. I just tossed 'em."
2,Fair,These sunglasses aren't as clear as Eagle Eye sunglasses. Protection from the sun not as good.I wouldn't tell people to by them.
2,not that great,Really not that great. There are better products out there for the same price. I was disappointed in the quality of it. Didnt really make my hair very soft
4,"Great unscented, fragrance-free conditioner!","This is a very good quality hair conditioner, made even better for those of us who don't tolerate perfumes by being completely unscented and fragrance-free. I've spent $7-8/bottle for good quality conditioners before, and think that this one is right up there in quality. It rinses clean, isn't oily. Try the Stonybrook unscented shampoo, too, which is also a great product."
4,fine conditioner,"After I washed my hair, I added the conditioner on my hair. It did not have instructions on how to use, which was fine- it's conditioner. This means it is not a well defined product. Still I tried using the product my own way."
2,ok but not grate,"This products doesn't get my hair as clean as I'd like, and leaves my hair a tangled mess when I'm done! and not smooth at all but other then that It's alright!. I found a much better product called ""nonsense unsented hair products"" an I love it!."
4,Worth the buck!,"This is the first Nickelback CD I bought. I would say it's worth the buck spent. This is a ""must have"" for Nickelback fans and for those who love hard rock(with grungy leanings). It's a real""best of"" for Nickelback. Songs are cohesive and good for listening when you're in an angry mood."
4,Very inclusive and fascinating history of welcoming the spring,My 3 yr old enjoys learning about the different rituals and traditions and talking about them with us. I like that this book doesn't focus too intently on one particular religious practice -- we prefer to give our child exposure to different spiritual ideas without pushing one in particular.
5,A must for every child being raised Spiritually,"These Equiox and the Solstice books are cute and fun to read, at the end of the book are crafts and ideas to do with your children for the Equinox. I also like all the history it has in it, I learned quite a bit myself!! :)"
5,Beautiful but underrated,"I have to go with the positive reviews that show up here, for all three of the O'Kanes albums. When they came out, I was working in large-market country radio. Rarely have I ever been as excited about new releases, as I was every time Kieran and Jamie put out another release as a duo.Since I handled music and programming on a syndicated network level, you can be sure I played the hell out of their first two discs, especially.Top-notch songwriting, creative arrangements and production. Too bad radio never really woke up to them."
5,Thoroughly enjoyed,"If San Francisco is like this, I'm soooo there next vacation! The organisation depicted is very interesting and well thought out and I really enjoyed the plot. The snared tourist is thoroughly delightful. The other characters are vibrant and very sexy, as are the sessions. Definitely a wonderful read and a fine addition to any library of erotica."
4,Collectable Collection for Collectors who Collect these.,"I never give collections 5-stars so we'll never know if this deserves them - but it is a nice little collection of early 70's Hawk-tunes. The cuts are taken from 'Hawkwind'('70), 'Silver Machine'('72), 'Doremi Fasol Latido'('72), and 'Born to Go' is from 'Space Ritual'('73). An excellant introduction to HAWKWIND's seminal work. You sure get a good deal time-wise on this disk, it's over 77 minutes long. This recording was well engineered and sounds great, although some of the original recording limitations are apparent on a few cuts - but that's perfectly acceptable considering the wonderful tunes."
2,not very good.,"This thing was a disappointment big time. Very cheap for something over 20 bones. The head ""harness"" is just a velcro strap that wraps around your head. It doesn't stay tight and slips down over your ears which feels nice...I'm not too sure how sturdy this thing is and cover my face when using it in case it wants to snap and hit me in the eye. You could easily make this at home using a bungie cord so save your money on this one."
3,Not yet the standard biography,"Holmes is always readable and SEEMS always sympathetic to Coleridge, but readers should be aware that Holmes as portraitist manipulates the lighting to suit his purposes. That is, he brings out the side of STC that he believes will win him to a modern reader -- such as Coleridge's anguished sexuality -- while putting in the shadow the man's religious writings. In a 900-page book, Holmes gives about two pages to one of STC's major life-works, AIDS TO REFLECTION, a metaphysical-religious tome, and a mere paragraph to his last book, ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE CHURCH AND STATE. Holmes is much more interested, it appears, in the possibility that Coleridge saw the woman he loved in bed with Wordsworth -- something STC himself said he knew was just a ""phantasm"" of his mind. Thus, Holmes's two-volume biography is more readable than it is judicious."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"This knife is genuine, but its worth about 75$ so honestly ask yourself, why would you ever pay over 400$?"
5,Presario Laptop Battery,"This battery worked out great. The transaction was fast and easy, and worked out perfectly. Thank you!"
4,"Does exactly what it supposed to, except...","This Super Clamp, designed for Ultimate's keyboard rack works just like it's supposed to work EXCEPT the rubber pads come off with a sticky mess about one week after you start using it. The clamp and rods are plenty strong and work exactly as they should but I don't know why they haven't solved the pad problem after all these years making this particular unit.Still, if you own the Ultimate keyboard stand you already know how good it is, so you're ""stuck"" with the pads. Otherwise I give this two thumbs up."
3,Tribars not included,"If you buy this clamp, be advised you must also find the two long tribars to fit it separately. While this clamp is pricey, and they are not included..."
5,You gotta see it!,"Hands down this movie is an all-time favorite of mine. I randomly picked it up in a movie store about seven years ago and fell in love with it. The characters are corky, the story is good and the scenarios are comical in a foul kind of way. It's a tale of a man whose past catches up with him just when he thought he had left it behind. It's got everything one needs to stay interested and wonder...could a Thursday really get this bad? But when it's over I always wish it would have continued to tell the story of Casey and his questionable friends."
5,the best movie i have ever seen,I really really liked this movie. Thomas Jane is a great actor. The movie is just filled with suprises. Every time you think that his problems are over here comes another. I'm definately sure i woke my mom up while laughing at his built up frustration.
2,Unintentionally funny.,"This movie could have been very good, but wasn`t. Thomas Jane (Punisher)..was very good, but he looked like a ass, as did aaron Eckhart. There are several scenes where the words are not in sync with the film...(at least on my dvd)...This film of an ex-criminal who is trying to go straight, but whose past won`t let him is an old plot, but done here to some comic effect.....and some dumb direction, at times. (why doesn`t Casey grab the gun when the rasta man is sleeping off his pot?). Mickey Rourke ( easily the best actor in this film).. makes a short, but Strong appearance as a rogue cop. The end is overly predictable...but still, the movie is interesting, if you like low budget B-films. Like mickey Rourke`s ""Shades"" film...sometimes bad can be good."
