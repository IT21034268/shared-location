1,Non-functional,"My item is non-functional. This is the first time I had a chance to use it, and it doesn't work. I had one years ago that worked well though. I am really wishing I had tried this one a while back when I got it."
4,Romance with a Bit of Mystery,"This is the story of a happily married, rich couple. The husband dies in a plane crash and mysteriously denies his wife all his wealth and many mansions throughout the country. She is left with a rundown farmhouse in rural Virginia. She has many self esteem problems now as she learns, brought about by her ""loving"" husband. He would sabatage all her diets, buying her candy and telling her he loved her the way she was. Predictably, she meets a local . . .When life gives you lemons, make jam!"
3,It started out good.,I liked the concept of the book in the beginning.. But as it develped I found myself getting bored and eventually I didn't even finish the story.Also it just left too many questions unanswered.
3,Pass the Berries,"I have to agree with most of these reviews. The story started out great and kept my interest untill the chase in the end to solve the mystery by finding lost geriatric characters. It was far too involved, intertwined and connected to everyone mentioned so far. It's a wonder Jimmie ever got away a made a life, but was it so bad he had to pay off everyone to keep it a secret?I've read much better stories, but you can't win them all."
1,Going from Fat to Thin,"Like the heroine in the Mulberry Tree, Deveraux continues to go from fat to thin in her recent writings. Being a farm girl I've spent my life making preserves and canning. I really don't need a cooking education. Should I ever, I know that there are many books in the COOKING SECTION that should help me. Deveraux spent more time explaining how to can foods, (something that must have totally excited her when she researched this book), than she did developing a romance between Bailey and Matthew. Her books used to be so very good. What is happening with our girl? Please don't bother with this book, especially if you're an avid fan like me. This, as well as many recent novels, only serve to depress those of us who have followed her for years."
5,The Mulberry Tree,One of the best books I've ever read. I've got it in paperback & ordered it on my Kindle Fire so I can read it anytime I want.
2,Strange story,"I didn't like this book at all. In fact I am surprised I finished it. I am not a fan of flash back stories anyway, but as I read the convoluted 'plot' twists in this book, I was frustrated and really didn't give a crap what happened in the past. I cared more about her present (becoming a person in her own right) rather than her husbands tragic past. I felt the emphasis on his strange upbringings and the entire small town he grew up in were very uninteresting, and her life and accomplishments were given short shrift."
1,Incomplete Storyline; Unresolved Issues,"The book seemed a little too far fetched for me. How is it that she was expected (by a husband who had no clue that his lawyer would help her as he did) to start from the ground up and restore such a piece of trash house being all alone and having no money. My big question and someone PLEASE answer this - why did her husband leave her penniless when he couldn't stand his so-called siblings. I know he wanted questions answered and he said he would leave her ""what she needed,"" but how was she realistically supposed to do the job he wanted without a penny to her name? And why leave all of his money to two siblings he couldn't stand? I was hopeful these questions would be answered by the end of the book, but they never were. Someone please enlighten me. This book was the first one I have ever read by Jude Deveraux; it has put a bad taste in my mouth for her work. I would rate it as incomplete and would hope someone could help change my opinion of her work."
1,Her worst book ever,"What is going on with Mrs. Deveraux? She has gone from books like ""Knight in Shining Armor"" to this trash? It's almost hard to believe that both books were written by the same author. She used to write such good, steamy romances. I didn't even realize Baily and Matt were suppossed to be the main romantic couple until I was halfway done. Don't waste your time. Read anything that she's written up to and including ""An Angel for Emily"". Her current books are awful."
2,Was Jude just trying to fulfill a contractual obligation?,"Bleaugh. I'm a great Deveraux fax, and have read most of her books muliple times, but this one read like she wrote it in her sleep. The main male character came across as shallow and kind of creepy. I wanted Bailey/Lillian to get away from his neediness and give herself time to grieve her husband instead of jumping right into a relationship.Wasn't especially funny, and the pacing lagged. I suggest ""The Summerhouse"" or ""Knight in Shining Armor"" instead."
3,What happened to the end?,"This book flowed well, but the last chapter was definately rushed! I was disappointed."
2,Confusing/Lifeless,"This story had so many minor characters you needed a directory to keep track of them. The main character Baily was such a spineless, pathetic person she fit in perfectly with the emotionally sick husband - Jimmy.The love interest with Matt was boring and lifeless.This book seemed to be about a constant search for a plot! But unfortunately it was never really found."
4,Is it a romance? it is a mystery?,"Who can tell? But I dont care! I loved it and read it non-stop for 2 days. (Kids got in the way!) I love Deveraux's books and this one was no exception. I loved the mysteries within the mysteries. I loved the characterizations. I loved the setting. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I found it hard to believe that so many of her friends would up and move to be in that small town and to help her set up the business. But overall, I really did like it."
5,An Engrossing Novel I Couldn't Put Down,"I had just started reading Deveraux's novels and loved everyone but the Mulberry Tree has become one of my favorites. Bailey and Matt are dynamic characters that develop more and more as the story continues. As with all of Deveraux's books that I've read, I finished this the night I bought at about 3 AM.What I really found intresting about this is she swayed away from her normal romantic plots for one with more depth. It was a refreshing change that showed Deveraux's true talent as an author..."
4,Good Airplane Book,"This is a great airplane book: a story that is absorbing and well written enough to compensate for being stuck for hours on a plane. Sizzling sex is not part of the story at all, but a good plot is. Unfortunately, the book ended before the plot ran out of steam, which is why it gets a 4-star instead of 5-star rating. Devereaux should have spent more time creating depth around the romance as well as unraveling the mystery -- in other words, should have been a longer book. But it was well-written and the supporting characters were interesting."
2,yuck,"I've loved (until now) everything that Jude Deveraux had written. This book [was bad]. Nothing seemed to be completely explained and the chemistry between the two main characters (Bailey & Matt) was nil. Their fire was so [bad], I thought midway through the story that it was going to be revealed that they were brother and sister! Not a book I would recommend."
2,Disappointing,"The book starts off with a bang and slowly peters out. I was disappointed because I have enjoyed most of Jude Deveraux's books. I got the impression that she rushed to tie up lots of loose ends in a ridiculous plot. At this point, my attitude was, ""Who Cares!"" If you see it in a garage sale for a quarter, it might be worth reading."
2,What a Let Down,I love The Summerhouse. This book's ending is such a disappointment. There were no explanations of how the farmhouse got into Jimmie's hands. A lot of things don't tie in and it's plain confusing. Why does he need to ask Lilian to find out the truth when his grandmother was still alive!
1,Mediocore,"I have to start off by saying that this is the first book that I have ever read by Jude Deveraux. Saying that, this book did not convince me to keep reading her work. The story was terrible. The heroine was boring the whole first part of the novel. There was never a connection between her and the hero-oh he tastes her chutney and bam!-in love, lets move in together. The heroine's husband was terrible to her before he died, yet she didn't see anything wrong with him. There were like ten billion characters from the pot smoking ex whore to a crazy mountain man. Do not waste your money on this book!"
4,A little spice with lots of love,"A lovely, well-written quick-reading book with lots of sexual tension and spice. I have a friend who reads it at least twice a year."
4,a fun book to read,"Mulberry Tree is a fun book to read - a bit out of the ordinary and just fun. There are loose ends that could have been better wrapped up or explained, but it was entertaining and perhaps the reason for the book is simply entertainment!"
2,Unfortunately....,"...not one of her best books. The story seemed to be unfinished, and left me feeling that maybe a lot of pages had been torn out. It should be revised because there is a lot of promise in the story."
3,"Great writing & characters, but I prefer traditional Jude D.","The writing is a 5, but I give it a 3 because I like the traditional Jude love story and The Mulberry Tree is an example of another good romance writer jumping on the romantic/suspense bandwagon. I'm disppointed because the book begins in a such a way that I thought I was reading a classic Jude Devereau story .... a story about a woman who overcomes obstacles, discovers her personal strengths, and finds love along the way. Instead it takes a turn into a mystery-suspense about ""The Golden Six."" If you like romantic suspense, you'll enjoy Jude's latest."
3,Almost a Great Read,"The book started out with all the earmarks of a great read. And it almost was. Loved the premise of the story, the murder mystery was well done and kept me guessing until the very end and some of the characters were exceptionally well developed. Loved Patsy and Janice.But the story was rather carelessly patched together in spots and in some places credibility was stretched so thin that it jolted me out of the story. Things always worked out just a little to well for Bailey and some of the characters motives were a little far fetched. Had to stop reading and roll my eyes several times. Ms. Devereaux could have spent a little more time thinking things through and might have come up with a real winner here.However if your not a nit picker like I am, and you like a good romantic suspense story, you will probably enjoy this book."
1,"Confusing, Convoluted, Terrible","Wow, what happened to the Jude Deveraux that I've read and loved for 15 years? This book was just awful. Could anyone else use a different name, what were there 4 people with 2 names each? It was like 3 or 4 plots all rolled into one very bad and disjointed story. Too many people, not enough character development, strange plot lines, and who edits these things?The character of Arleen had her name spelled Arlene in the last 2 chapters.I will be VERY careful before I spend [this much] on another Jude book.What a shame."
3,Disappointing...,"I have read all of Jude Deveraux's books, and I agree with most of the other reviews I have read about this one. The Mulberry Tree could have been much better. It reminded me a little bit of Sweet Liar, which was, in my opinion, her last really good book. The Mulberry Tree started off in a promising manner, but then towards the end of the book, just completely fell flat. All of a sudden characters were getting killed off left and right, and it totally didn't fit with the rest of the novel. The point of the story, was for the protagonist to find out the truth about her husband and her past, but really about finding herself. I liked the book pretty much up until about halfway through. Jude Deveraux should stick to writing romance novels, and not try to be a romantic suspense novelist, like Linda Howard. It just doesn't work."
3,ok - could have been better,"There have already been several reviews of the plot of the book so I won't go over the story again. Little things irritated me like Bailey (her new name) being able to go into a kitchen at midnight in a home she had just moved into and can truly exotic fruit and vegetable combinations by the jar-ful - this is not the piece of cake she makes it appear to be. I also got a little confused toward the end when everyone involved seemed to have a different original name. I think there were too many ""unusual"" personalities for one story. I have read every single Jude Devereaux book she has written (even Casa Grande)and I don't mind she has gone into the mystery/suspense mode but the number of characters involved needs to be limited if you have a mystery to unravel too. It wasn't a bad read, just a confusing one."
1,"Boring, Disappointing Read","What a disappointment...I've read all of Jude Deveraux's previous books and loved them. This book just seemed pointless, after the first couple of chapters your just trying to get through it.I'm assuming that J. D. is attempting to do what it seems a lot of romance writers are now doing and that is, write outside of the genre. Well this was a lackluster effort.Not worth your beach reading time."
4,Not typical Jude Devereux but good.,"I'm sorry that other readers have not enjoyed this book as much as I have. Even though it took me some time to get into it, it was a very good book. It is nothing like Jude Devereux's other books, so it took me some time to understand that. But, it's something that is enjoyable and interesting to read. I hope readers will give it a chance, even if it isn't historical romance. It's not a bad book. It just isn't what I was expecting."
3,Way Too Confusing,"This was not what I expected from a book in the romance section of the bookstore. This is more of a mystery, and a way-too-confusing one at that. There are too many characters. I needed a flow chart while reading this book. The love story is endearing, but does not really make the book worth reading. There are better books out there."
3,An enjoyable puzzling story,"I listened to the book on CD on my way to and from work. I enjoyed the interplay between characters and getting to know them a little bit. Although not entirely unpredictible, it was an interesting story--a puzzle with feeling. I could picture the house, the tree and the town. I enjoyed the narration. At times, I would find myself sitting in my car at my destination to listen to a little bit more, trying to find a good point at which to interrupt the story."
5,great stuff,I use this all the time. Works so well.Keeps hair where you want it to stay.I recommend it
2,A Shame,"This was a disappointment in comparison to ""Mists of Avalon"" and ""Forest House."" For some reason after the first part was finished I seemed not to care about the characters anymore or what happened at Avalon before ""Mists..."" The other detractor was the return of Druid/Christian conflict which, through important to the historical accuracy of the novel, is a tired subject. So when the characters entered into a theological argument I tended to skip paragraphs and began to loose interest."
4,A fun prequel,"Although this book is not as good as The Mists of Avalon, it's fun for readers who want to know more about that world. It runs from where the Forest House left off almost up to where Mists begins. (The Forest House is pre-Avalon and continues just up to Avalon's founding. I recommend reading it before Lady of Avalon.) It's divided into three sections. Each covers a different part of that time period and focuses on a different character. The third part focuses on Viviane, who is lady of Avalon in the Mists book and King Arthur's Aunt, when she was a girl. Fascinating to see the characters who came before those in Mists and the history of Avalon."
2,least enjoyable of the Avalon trio,"Having just finished all three of Bradley's Avalon novels, I am hard pressed to recommend her latest, but weakest, contribtuion to the ""saga"". Composed of three separate but somewhat related stories, they are uneven, rushed, and perilously close to ""bodice ripper"" plots. After reading ""The Forest House,"" the events in ""Lady of Avalon"" become repititious and predictable, with a palpable lack of imagination and wit in the story lines. It is ""deja vu all over again,"" and again, and again. I was bored, and I had the distinct feeling that Ms. Bradley was bored, too. One wonders if she could have written this book if her use of the exclamation mark was prohibited. ""The Mists of Avalon"" stands as the best of these chronicles, and can be enjoyed without feeling obligated to read ""Lady of Avalon."""
3,Longing for the Mists!,"As one who found the Mists of Avalon enchanting, I eagrely began this book looking for more of the magic. I would have been more likely to stumble across the Holy Grail.Though Lady of Avalon holds some interest, here and there, for those already familiar with Mists of Avalon, and the style of writing has its merits, it mainly is a disappointment. The characters seem to have no understandable motivation beyond having had relationships in previous lives.Of course, as one whose favourite character in Mists was Merlyn, I was especially disappointed in this shallow portrayal."
4,Finally!,"This is my first taste of the works of Marion Zimmer Bradley, but it won't be my last. For years I've been looking for an author who could do the impossible: Melding the Arthurian Legend, magic and all, with historical accuracy. The closest I ever got was ""Coming of the King"" by Nikolai Tolstoy, but that book was a bit unwieldy for all its literary merit. Bradley's novel flows easily. Where Tolstoy required every ounce of concentration to make anything of his book, Bradley can be read lightly during a lunch hour or before bed, where I get to do most of my reading. The only complaint I have about the book is that she could use three or four pages of transitional story between sections. One gets the feel of reading a book of short stories instead of a flowing solid novel. But this takes little from the enjoyment of the novel"
3,"Not as good as Mists of Avalon,Forest House, but worth it","Lady of Avalon jerked me around too much with sudden breaks and leaps in time, not to mention emotional cliff-hangers, but connects Forest House(which was wonderful) to Mists of Avalon (also great) so it's worth the read. If you're a hopeless romantic like myself, be prepared for gut-wrenchers."
5,Wonderful view of history from the women's perspective,I'm always bored by historical fiction mostly because I prefer to know about the daily lives of women and there is so little and rarely written this well
3,Plodding through . . .,"Unlike ""The Mist of Avolon"" and ""The Forest House"", I'm having a hard time following this one. I'm typically not a science fiction reader, but I enjoyed ""The Mist"" so much that I wanted to read everything MZB has ever written. I agree with a previous reviewer who stated that it felt more like reading a series of short stories. The one redeming part? - setting up a link with the preists and allowing us to meet Father Joseph of Aramathia(sp?)."
4,"Okay but not to the standard of ""The Mists of Avalon""","The book is okay as fantasy/Arthurian literature goes. However, it is far below the standard set by MZB in ""The Mists of Avalon"" or ""The Firebrand"" which are masterpieces of fantasy fiction. A question about historical accuracy: in chapter 7 of part I, set by the author around the year A.D. 106, a character referred to as father Paulus speaks about Augustine and his repentance. To the best of my knowledge St. Augustine was born on A.D. 354. Is Paulus a prophet or our beloved MZB blundered?"
4,"Not as good as MISTS, but...","LADY OF AVALON certainly is no competition for MZBs materpiece MISTS OF AVALON, but nevertheless, it still is a very readable and enjoyable novel with strong characters and strong emotions.I am looking forward to reading her next AVALON novel."
2,Can't touch Mists!,"Though I eagerly awaited this book, I was sorely disappointed! I was bored. I felt like I read the same story 3 times, and none of the characters had any verve. I agree with much of Ms. Olson's review; the stories lacked characterization, and I questioned much of their behavior. However, I DID find the ritual stuff interesting -- in fact, to my mind, that was the best part of the book. In sum, ""Mists"" was best, ""Forest House"" was okay, and ""Lady"" was the worst of the three. (Thank goodness, I read ""Mists"" first; otherwise, I would have missed the whole Darkover series, being unimpressed with MZB.)"
1,Very BORING. A complete waste of money.,I don't understand all the high ratings found here.The characters are so shallow that it's impossibleto feel any attachment to them and the story ofall three parts repetitious (even if you takeinto account that they're suppose to be reincarnations).I have not read the Mists of Avalon yet since I wasthinking of reading the books in order but this onereally put me off. I will never read anotherMarion Zimmer Bradley book again.
1,disappointing prequel to Mists of Avalon,"I don't know about you, gentle readers, but I loved the MISTS OF AVALON, affectionately known as Ms Magazine goes to Camelot. The pageantry, the mythology of the Goddess, the feminism! Great book no question. However in Ms. Bradley's new prequel, LADY OF AVALON, I was grievously disappointed. The cover shows a Stevie Nicks look a like in a blue smock with a slightly constipated look on her face. That's as good as it gets.Reincarnation, heavy handed New Age philosophy and very sketchy characters (the priestesses of the sacred Isle of Avalon snipe at each other like annoyed girl scouts) add up to a mishmash unworthy of Ms Bradley and her previous works. It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I had to go rent Monty Python and the Holy Grail."
4,Second-best in the series,"I disagree with those who think this is the weakest in the MISTS trilogy. I believe THE FOREST HOUSE is the weakest of the three---although I love all of them. WHat may be causing a problem for some is the fact that this novel refers heavily to one of MZB's early, little-read novels, THE FALL OF ATLANTIS. I recommend everyone read THE FALL OF ATLANTIS (it's recently come back into print) before reading LADY OF AVALON; the plot will be a lot more interesting and make a lot more sense if you have the Atlantean background given in FALL OF ATLANTIS to make sense of a lot of the ancient Avalon lore, as well as the understanding that the three souls that keep getting reincarnated in each era (The Son of Kings, Isarma, Dierna) are actually traceable back to FALL OF ATLANTIS."
3,"Not bad, not great.",THe book is pretty good but it cant compare to the mists of avalon. Its amazing that the same person wrote both books.
3,Lady of Avalon,"Extremely well-written tale detailing the ""modern"" Isle of Avalon. Through three separate sections, though each deals with reincarnations of characters from the previous section, the reader gains additional insight into the relationship between the priestesses and monks, Romans and Saxons, etc. The first two sections seem to serve as more of a historical briefing, yet they are able to keep the reader interested through good writing and extraordinary plot lines. The third section deals with the fostering of Vivanne at Avalon and how her ""relationship"" with her mother (who is, of course, Lady of Avalon) shapes her mindset in _Mists_. All-in-all, a wonderful book."
2,Comperably difficult and shallow,"Compared to ""The Mists of Avalon"" (a marvelous book) and even ""The Forest House"" (which was a shade off the first but still readable) this book rings hollow. Sadly so, because it is broken into three parts with a great deal of potential to explore various segments of history between the first two novels. Somehow it comes up lacking; as if the author simply missed the characters and times, and revisited both with mediocre success. The energy of the first, and the trauma of the second, is lacking. If you truly enjoyed ""The Forest House,"" however, and wish to revel in the legacy of Eilan and her lover, you may enjoy this as well."
3,"A good book, but not SUPER!","I've read ""The mists of Avalon"" and ""Forest House"" by Marion Zimmer Bradley, and I'd have to say that they are better stories than the ""Lady of Avalon"" book. I am not saying I didn't like it, just that it didn't measure up to the other two I've read. I felt it was done quickly and without the same passion as the other two. It is readable, and I would recommend it nonetheless."
3,Not great; puts Avalon events into historical perspective.,This book reads like it was written mainly to answer questions about how history got from events in The Forest House to Mists of Avalon. It seldom comes alive otherwise. There are three sections. In the first section we find out the fate of Eilan's son Gawen and learn just how it was that the holy isle of Avalon became separated in time from the world and surrounded in mists. The last section ends with the introduction of Viviane and the story behind the birth of Morgause. The storytelling itself isn't up to the level of the two books that it links. It wasn't very absorbing and I ended up just skimming through through the last two sections.
3,"Better than Forest House, worse than Mists","I don't think that anyone in the world is capable of writing two books like Mists in one lifetime, even MZB. After reading TFH, I almost didn't buy this book when it came out, I couldn't stand seeing MZB lower herself like that again. However, I finally screwed up my courage and bought this book. I don't regret it, even though it had no hope of matching Mists in terms of complexity and scope. It was still a moving book. It was better than TFH, though, it wasn't just a romance novel with some historical facts worked in. It earns the title ""Prequel"" in that it actually relates to TMoA, with similar themes and characters we know, unlike TFH, which kind of came out of the blue."
3,"Not Mists of Avalon, but what else is?","I might have liked it better if it had been by an unknown author--decent fantasy, but not all that wonderful. It doesn't have the intense sense of place of Mists of Avalon, and it gets frankly silly now and then.I think a great part of the technical genius of Mists of Avalon was that it didn't give everything away. _Lady_ is too explicit, and too hokey. I don't really want a chant-by-chant breakdown of each and every ritual, and the magic is too much like magic in cheap fantasy novels, not the way it was handled in the earlier book, where everything seemed utterly credible while you were reading.Not the best."
2,Formula-itis,"This Avalon didn't enchant, it bored. Bradley's formula here serves as a crutch to pole this unwieldy boat through a lake of molasses to the Isle of Trite"
3,How Lady of Avalon Relates,"As many have said this was not one of the better works in the Avalon series.However the three novellas, while in themselves do not give you much time to become attached to the characters each has its own purpose within the series.For instance the fist section follows Caillean's journey to found Avalon after leaving the Forest House, and to create the world that still captivates readers 20 or so years after Mists was originally published.The second section ties in to the sequel Priestess of Avalon, which encompasses the entirety of is written in the novella about Dierna.Lastly the third section recounts the early life of Vivane. So although Lady may not be the best out of the series is it is still an essential part of the collection."
2,Not as described,"The key fob took forever to ship.It's also a different shape than pictured. Instead of being a rounded square, it's a circle.Also, the metal is shiny, not the brushed metal look as in the picture.Overall, it's still a fine key chain, but I don't know if I would have bought this had the picture been accurate."
5,A Mystery I Couldn't Put Down,"The first sentence in the book leaps off the page and grabs you. ""'You called the cops?' I asked, gawking at the corpse. I would've preferred to think I was staring, but I knew , in all likelihood, I was gawking.""The speaker is Jesse Ascencio, a real class act private investigator with an intriguing background; former Congressman,FBI agent, poetry writer and faithfully married man. Who wouldn't like him?The corpse is a murdered Asian beauty in a Southern California coastal amusement park.Ascencio, working closely with an African American detective, dives into the investigation only to be hit with additional daily murders. He soon finds himself embroiled in a much bigger picture involving smugglers, prostitutes and then real danger to himself! All the ingredients to keep us reading through the night; just as an excellent mystery should.I'm anxiously looking forward to Mr. Braithwaite's second, third and fourth novels."
5,A Gold Nugget,"California has always been a gold mine for crime fiction. Hammett. Cain. Chandler. MacDonald. In recent times, Roger Simon, Sue Grafton, Marcia Muller, Bill Pronzini, Sue Grafton, Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and Jan Burke. Kent Braithwaite joins their ranks with his crime novel The Wonderland Murders. It continues the Golden State's golden crime fiction tradition with modern noir twists. His PI is Latino. His themes echo contemporary times. This novel definitely deserves the attention it has received from newspapers, TV, and radio, including Newsweek and NPR. It is a true gold nugget."
1,Dull and poorly written,"Based on the large number of recommendations and the many lists throughout the book section of this site, I picked up this novel. I was hoping for a good mystery but found it rather lacking. The story lacked suspense and the writing style was limited. ..."
5,L. A. Mystery At Its Best,"Kent Braithwaite is a high-profile Los Angeles-based mystery writer, and THE WONDERLAND MURDERS is an L.A. mystery at the top of its form. The author has impressive resume of short fiction, mystery convention speaking appearances, and teaching mystery writing at several colleges. He served as a judge for this year's Edgar Allan Poe Award. This novel marks an important point in Mr. Braithwaite's career.THE WONDERLAND MURDERS tells the story of a string of homicides along the southern California coast. It is set in a fictionalized suburban L.A. beachfront community. Its lead is a Latino private eye. The novel tackles serious social issues and provides an intriguing crime puzzle. NEWSWEEK magazine wrote that it was a great book. I have to agree."
2,Not recommended for women,"I purchased this book hoping for a good mystery/thriller, but was somewhat disappointed. While there is a pretty good mystery there, I found the writing to be lacking and, at times, repetitive. Normally, I like to share my books with friends after I've completed reading them, but due to the foul language and crude remarks about female characters in this book, I will only be sharing it with the trash can. I'd be too embarrassed to share it with any females I know."
1,Dull,This is a rather unimaginative mystery novel. It was dull and without the tension and suspense that a good mystery requires to hook the reader.
5,A Real Joy to Read,"Wonderland Murders is intriguing and fun to read. What a unique combination of characters and situations! It is such an accurate description of California life, and I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. I hope to see more novels with Jesse Ascencio seeking to solve new challenges."
1,Unrelentingly Dull,"This was a poorly plotted novel with leaden dialogue and paper-thin character development. The story line wasn't remotely plausible, and the ending was predictable. Try Ross McDonald for California-based mystery novels."
3,NOT the originals,"There were no reviews when I bought this. I took a gamble, hoping that this was a collection of originals - not so. They're re-done, more modern versions of the songs. Doh. They're still the UK Subs and that's great, but it wasn't what I was hoping it would be."
5,Hilarious,"I read this book October 2000. It was joy to read. Not only is Sister Betty...(opps I mean Pat)a great writer, she is also a great comedian. It was a pleasure meeting you."
5,SITCOM...SITCOM,This book is one of the funniest books I've every read and should be developed into a sitom! It's funnier than the comedy Amen or any others. I know Sister Betty she belongs to my church!!!Keep writing Pat!
2,If there were 2.5 stars....,"that would have been my rating. I, like a previous review, was very disappointed because I was expecting a novel. But I will not call this 'bad' writing. It is definately a script that needs the action of actors and the visual of scenery.The same applies for the second book Sister Connie Fuse."
2,The Pevear and Volokhonsky translation of this text is not as good as others.,"I would recommend the P&V; translation of THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV as I believe it is better than one by Garnett. Of the translations of NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND I think the P&V; version is not so good. I would go with the MacAndrew text.My mind works in much the same way as does the narrator in NOTES, and I find the word choice in the P&V; translation to be somewhat incongruous at times."
4,The Underground,"Dostoyevsky has written a macabre short novel. Throughout the book there permeates a dark sense of menace - the nameless characters mental unrest is captured with great prose style. The characters mental indecision is also expressed clearly, with rather confused and verbal lines.There are two chapters in this novel. The first deals with the philosophical aspects of Dostoyevsky's own opinions, summed up generally as: A rather idiosyncratic kind of existentialism, and ultimate angst at a society laced with custom and stifled social stratification. While the second section deals with events in the characters life which have led to this philsophical stance. We are exposed to the pernicious, and obbsessive behaviour of the character, as he is driven into fits of rage and anxiety of the tritest of events.Dostoyevsky has written a compelling book: sinister, unstable and in-depth. Each page casts a shadow. Each line is filled with sharp nihilism. Read this book with a light on!"
1,Ugly. Like looking at a newly born sparrow.,I could not find any redeeming reason to read this. I did not want to be near the book after trying. I tried as he was supposed to be a great author. My memory tells me that I threw this book into the trash. I did not want it on my book shelf.
4,Profound,"This is one of those books in which the character(s) are so richly drawn, so strange and yet not unbelievable, that they almost seem real. Dostoevsky had a wonderful ability to create people who were terrible, evil, and downright detestable, but whom you still became fascinated by. Of course, his point was always one of healing and redemption: that these good things were there for the taking, even for the lowest of the low, if only the low would come down from their heights of pride and lower themselves far enough to accept what was offered by God. This novel is the type that makes you want to grab ahold of the lead character by the collar and yell at him, ""What is wrong with you!? Don't you see what you are doing to yourself, and to others? Are you happy stuck in this endless cycle of misery?"" But some people really *are* stuck in a rut, and continue a cyclical life of misery their entire lives; in the end, sadly, that's what makes this book so realistic and powerful."
3,Listless Book,"I've read Dostoevsky's Brothers and Crime and Punishment, and after reading Notes, I felt this was more of a psychological book than what I liked.I loved Brothers, but this was too much of a mind book for my liking. To tell the truth I listened to Notes from an audio book, and the narrative was too listless and introspective to allow for a flowing story. If you handle psychological books, then you might enjoy this book, but it takes a lot to get through it."
5,Master At Work,"You cannot help but wonder at Dostoevsky's brilliance. With such an extraordinary style, decades ahead of its time, it is no wonder his contemporary critics got it all wrong. No, the underground man is not comparable to its author; this only shows the depth of the author's grasp into the intricate labyrinth of man's psyche. I believe Dostoevsky's understanding of human behaviour is superior to many so-called classic psychologists with theories and countless volumes on the subject, and this book demonstrates it. The book is exceptional, but I wouldn't suggest this translation, it is somewhat hackneyed."
5,My liver hurts,"Oh yes folks, the way the world is moving--all of its gene and DNA tampering, alienated labor, hyper-consciousness, and disillusionment--it appears as though underground men are going to be popping up all over the place, if they haven't already. It's all here, and what Dostoevsky had predicted through his dazzling clairvoyance, is already happening so take heed you capitalist drones, you mad scientists; you'll soon drown the world under the machine once and for all, until there isn't anything human left in our existence. To put it simply, I enjoyed this book thoroughly, so pick it up and make yourself sick with joy as I have."
5,"""I AM A SICK MAN...I am a wicked man.""","Brilliant...One of my favorite Dostoevsky books!It's a short tale that explores the neurotic mind.From the first line...""I AM A SICK MAN...I am a wicked man.""This work is a painfully honest fictional exploration into the human heart.MikeG"
2,american indian collection,i only bought this dvd because is stated in the review. it had the movie i willfight no more forever. it was a made fot tv movie. needless to say after opening the dvd. it did not have the movie as stated in the add. but a small documentary. not the movie with james whitmore as stated.
5,This CD is one of the best I have ever heard!!,"If you like acoustic music(which I certainly do) then this one is for you. All the other reviews I have seen are very positive for a reason. In my opinion this is one of the best LPs ever made. And I just started listening to these guys. Their regular stuff is taking me awhile to get hooked on the vocals, but the music is very good. Now this CD here, I heard one short mp3 online and was immediatly hooked on both vocals and music. Just without a doubt a great CD!!"
1,This is not the ENVY from Japan,"I bought this CD here on Amazon thinking it was a CD from the semi-Mogwai-related (they are on their label in Europe) Japanese band Envy. What I got was a truly awful goth-emo-whine album. Please avoid at all costs if you are looking for the Japanese band. Somehow, this record has received great reviews from others, but I smell a rat. The album is truly abysmal."
2,too much snow comes off the sides,"This product has tremendous potential, but in snowfall that is only ~1-2 inches deep it simply pushes the snow off to the sides more than it collects the snow up onto the Snowscoop.The front edge of the Scowscoop is thick and blunt, rather than a thinner blade like a normal snow shovel. This means the snow has to rise above a 1/2 to 3/4 inch surface in order to get up onto the Snowscoop. Unfortunately this causes any snow less than an inch deep to simply be pushed forward (rather than coming up onto the Snowscoop) and it eventually just gets pushed off to the sides of the Snowscoop.I love the very sturdy wheel, and I like the ability to replace the metal protector edge. I think a differently designed protector blade could improve on the design even more, providing a gradual ramp up onto the Snowscoop, and perhaps even adding side walls that force more snow onto the Snowscoop rather than escaping off to the side."
2,Somewhat helpful/No replacement for a Snowblower,"Its great on flat surfaces, so order wisely. If you have an older driveway or uneven sidewalks, i would think differently. But...it has been somewhat helpful, i think it also needs more than one wheel. And a blade that is more heavy duty."
2,one was given to me,One of these was given to me by a friend and I tried it twice. It worked OK in light snow but in anything over a few inches (or heavy snow) just was very difficult - it cant pick up the snow and I dont have enough horsepower to compress the piles to make room for the snow. a bit of a disappointment but it was free to me.
3,Just ok,The graphics are great but the stickers constantly peel from the wall and fall down. This is after one day...I'm hoping these stickers last but it looks like they won't :(
5,Awesome!,Great selection of oldies but goodies. I can't think of one song that should have been left out of this compilation. Anyone who loves and appreciates good reggae music will enjoy this CD!
1,"Defective product from vendor ""Geoinkonline""","I would NOT recommend this product. While attractively priced, the color ink cartridges though sealed, register in my HP OfficeJet 7140xi as ""bad ink"" on two out of three colors - and there are of course, multiple color cartridges in this pack.I suspect the attractive pricing here is because this vendor is reselling ink from reject lots. I'd stick to core Amazon shipped items and actual HP ink cartridges next time.Buyer beware!"
3,"Great Tent, poor carrying bag","The tent itself is a great item. It goes up and down easily. The carrying bag is thin and the seams fray and separate easily. The pulls easily come off from the zipper. I have two of these and both are doing the same thing. It looks like some sewing will be in my future. I may get some old fashioned knee patches and reinforce the corners. Try not to use the wheels to pull the item around or the straps to carry it. This only wears out the storage bag further by possibly dragging the corners through grass. When possible, carry the tent with a partner. I know, cumbersome. It may prolong the bag life for your unit. My only issue is with the cheaply made storage bag."
4,Instant awning for my patio,"I had cut down a tree and now my patio is in full sun. The Bravo Marketplace does the trick. I got it in red and it's very attractive. I just wish I were able to keep it up, but it advises that it should not be left out in the rain. I wish there were a way around this, as I have to find someone to assist me in taking it down and putting it up. Set up is easy and takes only minutes, but you do need 2 people, one at either end to do it."
5,"Great Product, Great Value","I just got this today and it took maybe 10 minutes to get up with a little help from another person. Knowing how to put it up now, maybe 3-5 minutes to put up alone. The top is vented to help with heat and wind. I have looked at a lot of tents at craft shows, and this tent is the best value by far. It comes with one wall. I am very happy with this product."
4,Bravo Marketplace 10x10 Canopy,"I like the canopy, but had a couple of problems. It had a broken plastic hinge which was replaced by by Bravo. The zipper was defective on the bag which Bravo did not replace. Beyound those problems, it was exactly what I was looking for."
4,The B-side,"This single is of cause the same as the original one. A great song we all know. But the ""7 version is a bit different than the album version and the single also contains a ""12 version. The B-side on this single ""Supernatural"" is a very good song and perhaps the main reason why you simply must own this cd. So if you don't have Supernatural, this is where you find it."
3,"""Okay....""","The extended version of ""Cherish"" is nice, but if you've heard the album version then you've heard it all. ""Supernatural"" is a song in which Madonna sings about her lover...who happens to be a ghost. Hmmm. Definitely not her best lyrical work. Still a good addition to your CD singles collection, though, but if you're not a hardcore collector, go buy the ""Like A Prayer"" album."
1,Where's the beef?,"My impression of the book is that it was rushed. The author seems to write ""off the cuff."" And it wasn't proof read very well, either. There are several glaring errors in the tables/figures early in the book. After seeing those, the whole work loses credibility. Another disappointment is the gloss over Bluetooth, though the title implies at least a serious introduction to the subject. I'm an engineer and what I do has to be right. It irks me when I waste time and money on a book which is produced in such a sloppy manner.P.S. If you are interested in Bluetooth, ""Bluetooth Revealed"" is IMHO a helpful introduction."
2,Incomplete Network Coverage,"As a mobile business solutions provider, I am amazed that Held fails to cover some of the leading networks for data applications. CDPD, Mobitex, Motient and satellite networks like OmniTracs have proven to have the most reliable, available coverage for data applications."
3,Low light,"Nice product. Heavy duty construction. Took out the bulb liner like the other guy said. Easy to do but I'm not pleased with the amount of light they put out. I mounted them low on tacoma truck, a 4x4. Wanted to fill in the areas on each side of front bumper when I turned. Not enough light. These would be good for daytime running lights."
4,Great product.,I really like these fog lights. Install was a bit tricky but that might just have been me. They have a nice wide pattern. I didn't like the switch that the kit came with so I used a different toggle switch. I did like how the kit came with everything you need. Very nice wiring with male and female terminals already crimped on the wires.
1,Buy something else,"The lights work well enough but the rest of the system really is cheap. The wiring is super small and heated up when first turned on, you think they would use something heavy with the wattage. I don't think the lights output was as good because of it. The connectors were loose fitting and had to be tightened up before installing, one had a bad crimp. The switch seemed little light duty but used it anyway. Ripped out all the wiring and installed my own heavier wire, works better and the light is brighter. Save your self a headache and spend a few bucks more on something with more quality. Get what you pay for!"
2,fog lamp kit,Poor Quality! Only had them on the truck for a couple of months before the inside lens broke apart and ruining the bulb.
5,Quality!!!,"Im very impressed with these lights. They come with easy to read instructions and a quality wiring harness that connects to your head lights. When your head lights come on you can turn your fog lights on or off, but when your headlights go off so do the fogs. dont have to worry about leaving them on. It took me about 40 minutes to wire them in and they look great. They throw a wider field of vision out and definitely brighten up the headlights of my crv. Overall, they are constructed out of metal and a great buy for $30 :) oh and they do have the wiring option of being ""driving lights"" meaning you can mount them somewhere high and wire them so that when your high beams come on so do they."
3,barely get the job done,"these are ok,not as nice as I thought theyd be.first off throw away the wiring they come with.I used it then had nothing but problems with the stupid fuses they come with,and the switch has been thrown away.it's junk.once I got some new wires and fuses it's a decent product,not as bright as I'd like but decent.the way they mount is frustrating, I got it tight enough to where it felt like it was going to strip almost and they still work their way loose.I live on dirt roads that can be rough at times but it's annoying to have your fog lights staring straight down every few days.I may go and make my own mount for them or something"
3,made in china,Don't mistake these for hella optilux or anything brand name as these are just some made in china fogs. I run them on my motorcycle and they work fine. definitely a fog light pattern. Removed the black thing from in front of the light.
3,Great lights with one issue,These feel well built and work great but they are not waterproof. Mine filled with water and stopped working. I did drive through some rivers so maybe i am asking too much.
2,Lights,Lights work great untill they break(crackd lense)then you have to buy another set because Hella does not offer replacement parts for the Optilux line of products.
1,do not disasemble / UPDATE,"If you do take these apart, and remove the bulb cap, make sure you get the rubber gaskets to seat properly upon re-assembling. I thought I had everything properly sealed, but I ended up with both lights looking like fish bowls, half full of water. Amazon would not honor past 30 days, however hella is honoring 1 yr. I will not screw with the new lights, and if they do not take on moisture, I will update my review.UPDATESo I received my replacement set and after a month of driving on sloppy roads, they too have moisture inside. These thing are garbage. If you have already ordered, try sealing them up with some caulk or something."
5,"awesome driving lamps , even better price","these came in about 12 days- amazon free shipping is slo...there is an internal black reflector that dims the light for foglight use,do yourself a favor and open up the unit and unscrew this black housing, to increase luminosity.installation is striaghtforward for foglamps. the wires included are bare, you may want to buy some wire loom. for the relay switch, i spliced it into the low beam headlamp hotwire to turn on when the lows are on.excellent light output.no complaints,sorry no pictures,"
1,dissolution,The novel was well written and greatly absorbing. One major problem-the last chapter or chapters was missing. I have tried to contact the supplier but have not received a response. Do not purchase from this supplier.Dissolution
2,Dissolution Book Sale failure,"I ordered this book some time ago and it never arrived. I placed an inquiry to the Seller and received a message that basically ""they forgot"" to send it. Apparently a search is underway to see if one is still in stock.The second book that I ordered from the same seller was shipped as it should have been and arrived on the predicted time.Please check to see what is going on and let me know if I can ever expect to receive this book.Thanks"
1,Smells like junk,"terrible, i hate this cd, they are all a bunch of Kurt wannabes screaming the lines of nirvana songs, they ruined every song on this album, the only reason any one should buy this is if you intend to burn it!"
1,"c r a p, plain and simple","sure, if i was in a crappy band and wanted to be like one of the greatest song writers and performers of all time, id cover nirvana in my own fashion too. but hell, they just dont sound right, and that just goes to show you why most havent even heard of these people. theres just not much talent there. i thought the version of breed was maybe slightly ok, but still nothing worth eighteen bucks. amazing songs, crappy versions."
1,A Disgrace to the Voice of a Generation,"When asked about this CD, I responed ""Its a bunch of [bad]British bands attempting to play Nirvana.""""So you dont like it?""""Yeah it[is bad]"" The only redeeeming quality of this CD, is the inside jacket, written very well by Dave Thompson whoever the hell he is. After listening to the whole CD twice through, I found only one song worthy of noting, that being ""On A Plain"". Unlike the other songs, Agent Orange plays the version as closely as it was recorded on Nevermind. I am only keeping the CD for those two reasons. I hope that future listeners of Nirvana are not turned off because of this [bad] CD, because if they do, it is CDs like this that ruin good bands."
1,Bored,"well, the only one reason I bought this cd is because I Love Punk Rock and the bands featured on this cd are all classic! but...really this tribute is bored! I don't like too much nirvana, just a few songs. And thats why I don't like this crap.Vibrators, Vice Squad, Uk Subs, Dee Dee Ramone are first wave of punk rock, and hearing them playin' slow music is rare and BORED, all people here say ""them are a bunch of bad english bands"". that's not true, they're classic!, and maybe the mixture of nirvana-punk never more should be on sale. If you wanna hear real good material of those bands you should buy old stuff, the first albums, Vibrators: Puremania, Vice Squad: punk singles collection, UK Subs: Another kind of blues (too much cocaine, my friend), and with Dee Dee you should buy first Ramones CDs.if you wanna hear nirvana, you better get the studio albums, the band is not bad...just a little slow."
3,its OK,"Its Ok but not great, like the Cleopatra Records tribute to Metallica was. I had that one first, and then bought this one because they sort of go together. This is coming from a big Nirvana fan who's not a Metallica fan at all, too. The cuts in general are a bit uninspiring, although the disk has its high points. Deedee Ramone's ""Negative Creep"" is nowehere near as good as his ""Jump In the Fire"" on the other record is (RIP, Deedee). Same with Flipper. I think that perhaps even though the Nirvana material is good, it doesn't transfer as naturally to other bands as the Metallica stuff does. Too idiosyncratic. I may like Blanks 77 ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" cover best. Overall, this baby is not gonna spend weeks on end in my 5-disk machine next to the Metallica trib, which has a nearly permanent spot. Next I'm gonna have to get the Cleopatra tribute to NOFX to add to this series. I don't know all their songs, but I partied with 'em back in '87!"
1,Tribute?,"These bands shouldn't even be allowed to play Nirvana songs. It sounds awful. Because of the version of Smells Like Teen Spirit on this CD, I will now have a distorted image every time I here the real song ever again. They really messed it up. There isn't one track I like on this whole ""tribute""."
3,Interesting but Verbose,"This book provides a lot of digression on topics that might be interesting to a reader. Things like what might motivate Microsoft's decisions, historical figures and occurrences, the philisophical issues behind some software design. Personally I enjoyed these diversions, but they are not germane to learning VBA. From the learning standpoint, the author does not provide an approach that builds up step by step, as texts do. He believes in the immersion approach, dumping the reader in the deep end and providing enough help that you don't drown. However, only gradually do you grasp the situation and begin to piece it together. I'd say that this book will accomplish its purpose and contains a lot of pertenant info, but it does require patience, and a willingness to let the author ramble in the hopes that he is going somewhere."
3,"nice umbrella, flawed case","This a nice very lightweight umbrella for sticking in your pocket or in a backpack. Unfortunately the case that came with it, which would have been a nice feature, had a taped on label on both sides that would not come fully off despite a lot of trying. The remnants of the label mar the appearance. This seems to be a new trend in labelling or packagaging products with adhesives that cannot be removed."
4,Kindle Charging Cable,I purchased this item to allow my Kindle to charge over USB and it works like a charm. The cable is designed in such a way that it seems to provide power to either the mini usb or the standard power adaptor. I even attempted to power 2 devices at once from a single USB port and was successful in lighting both charging lights as long as both devices were off. I haven't tested it extensively but I would guess that both would have charged slower since the same amount of power is being divided between 2 devices. I combined this cable with the Belkin Power strip and usb ports [...].I would recommend this cable for charging the Kindle from a USB port.The only reason that it is rated 4 stars in stead of 5 is that the construction does feel flimsy and could break easily if you pull too hard. I may purchase a second one just in case.
5,Touches the Soul,I just heard Jeanette in concert and immediately bought both of her CD's. My Father recently passed away and this music has been a healing ointment to my hurting heart. I've just listened to the entire CD 5 times and am not at all tired of it. I only changed CD's in the player because I was eager to hear her other music. Her music has incredible depth of emotion and beauty.
4,Fabulous but not for first-timers,"This is a fabulous book, with such depth and breadth each time you go back to flip it open something new catches your eye. That said, authenticity is prized over simplicity, and many of the dishes I enjoyed in Spain and wanted to recreate at home are surprisingly time-consuming if not complex to make - potatas bravas and potatas tortilla are 2 examples. However the rice dishes are outstanding and it's a wonderful education in using spices such as saffron and smoked paprika.This isn't a book for mid-week suppers or beginning cooks looking for everything condensed into a 5 easy steps. But the food it helps you produce is outstanding and its a great couch read."
5,Great commentary,"I have used the Word commentaries for Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the Psalms. I find them to be accurate, engaging, and easy to understand. I greatly appreciate the work toward providing some life application to the ancient texts."
5,Great,"They are very comfortable. After use you just wash them, let them dry and re-use on other shoes. So far, excellent."
2,Decent,I have used them once or twice and think they are more trouble than they are worth. They move around and do not fit in most of my heels (I wear a 5 1/2 to 6).
2,Fine mug but...,"I received this as a Christmas gift and I was very excited because the picture looks so nice. Once I opened it I was a little disappointed. The paint or glazing job is deplorable. Less than half of the berries are painted and the leaves are green circles that kind of hit the raised areas. My lid doesn't fit and the tea ball is tiny, half the size of most. It's also very light but mine holds 14 ozs so I guess thats nice. I definitely wouldn't buy another one or give as a gift. I had intended to buy the 8 piece place setting for next years Christmas dinner but I certainly won't now, after seeing the shoddy craftsmanship of this mug."
1,Disappointing!,"The cup has at least half of the berries unpainted, which makes it less pretty than it should be and the little leaf that is supposed to be attached to the diffuser was broken. which makes the diffuser unusable because the diffuser has no weight to keep the chain outside the cup. Im sure I can figure something out to make it work but its not something I should have to worry about when I buy a cup that comes with a tea diffuser. Im sincerely dissapointed with the quality of the cup and I expected more from it, the fact that some berries arent painted just shows a lack of interest from the producer for the quality of the product. I'm truly disappointed with the cup"
1,would have been great if it hadn't come chipped,"Nice price for a nice mug, cover and diffuser set. Very good for the holidays. Unfortunately, the one we received came with a chip out of it. I am asking for a replacement. We'll see how they respond and I will update my review accordingly..."
5,Wish I had bought two.,"This gift, for a special friend is so beautiful, I wish I had ordered one for myself."
3,The Presence,As Bela Lugosi vould zay it vas good scary movie because that's all you should ever look for in a horror. Well done
2,worked ok,"The movie was very choppy and kept ""loading"" every 10-20 seconds, then it might play for about a minute and then ""loading"" again. This was very frustrating and after about 10 min of this we stopped the movie and restarted it. After restarting the movie (and watching the first 10 min over again) the movie played fine with no problems. I noticed this problem with many Amazon rentals. I don't have streaming problems with any other site. The movie itself was very good and I'd give the movie at least 4 1/2 stars, I give Amazon 2 stars."
2,I could not get into this.,"Recently, I came across this movie, and thought I should try it out, but I wish I had not. Without any spoilers, there is a message in this story, and how the message was conveyed was... was... well, blah. There was, of course, the romance part of it, all horror movies have that, right? I guess this depends on what you were looking for at the time of watching, if you are looking for a lot of story and some romance in a horror movie, go for it."
1,Not horror -not interesting,This movie sucked big time. It was slow and very boring. The ghost was just a pale expressionless guy standing around watching. This movie was a total waste of time and money.
1,bad review,NEVER RECIEVED MY BOOK. NEVER GOT NOTIFIED WHAT HAPPENED. EMAIL THIS ACCOUNT USER AND STILL HAVENT GOTTEN BACK TO ME. DO NOT BUY FROM HIM.
4,Needed the exact diameter size,"The weight is sufficient, and the looks is great. Very comfortable handle. For my coffee machine, it was a bit small (about 2 milimeters). But it's not the product's fault, considering that the item was sent to Chile, better a bit smaller than a larger one that doesn't fit at all.Nothing else to say. If the diameter fits, get it. I'm very pleased with this one."
5,BIG and HEAVY like it should be!,"It's what you want a tamper to be: BIG and HEAVY. As you can see in the picture it has a nice long handle and a large heavy head. If you want a light pocket sized tamper, don't buy this one."
1,not a good choice,"This tamper is big, and heavy too.This is not a good choice for an ordinary espresso machine."
1,This was a fake!,"I have been wearing Vanilla Fields Cologne by Coty, exclusively for a few years. When I found it was no longer in the stores, I decided to purchase it online. What was sent to me had no relation at all to Vanilla Fields. There was no hint of vanilla in the fragrance at all and even the color of the liquid was wrong- an orange instead of a yellow color. Some kind of strong colored alcohol was in the bottle, and it had a strong odor, that had nothing to do with Vanilla Fields. Before this cologne was discontinued, I wore it every day and got many compliments. The vanilla was very present, but delicate. I know what I am talking about.BNFragrance King has replied back to my e-mail, apologized and claimed they had just shipped what they got from the distributor. I have sent the bottle back and they are refunding me in full.BN"
2,Not as advertised,"The towelettes are packed in an air tight envelope but are still very dry wehn opened. I found it barely removed the dust and on a good size screen you had to use several towels. I would never buy this product again, nor would I recommend it."
3,Remarkably Boring,"I really wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a big disapointment. Not only had I not heard of most of the people who reviewed the books, but I wouldn't want to read their novels after reading their reviews. Their reviews couldn't have been any more dry. I was highly disapointed and stopped about halfway through it because I couldn't stand a minute more of it."
4,the power of books,"Curious about what writers read & how books have influenced them, J. Peder Zane, a book review editor, invited 34 writers to contribute essays launched by the request that they fill in the blank: ""the most ______ book I ever read.""Rebeccasreads recommends REMARKABLE READS as a blog in which writers tell of what they were doing at the time they read their selected books; how their lives changed; their ideas about writing; their epiphanies & peeves. Yes, writers do read & write about what they read, quite well too!"
2,Too Expensive,"The card game is fine and came in a nice tin box. I had been looking for this particular card game that my son enjoys at his grandparents and could not find it except online, so I paid over $12 (including shipping) just so I could get it for him. Wouldn't you know, the week before giving it to him on Christmas, I found a ""Crazy 8's"" card game at a local drug store for only 99 cents!"
5,Great Product,"I have used this product for a number of years and it is one of my favorite shampoos. I have fine hair that has been chemically treated. This product leaves my hair manageable, full, and shiny. I use this intermittently with phyto citrus shampoo for even better results."
1,Not worth the money,"I used this shampoo for 5 days and observed no improvement in the appearance of my fine, thin hair as compared to other salon shampoos purchased for half the price. Note, I certainly don't expect shampoo to regrow hair or perform other miracles. I just wanted a little more lift and the appearance of volume. Didn't get that. It works fine as a shampoo. But it's really hard to use. How hard can it be to use shampoo? Well, when it comes in an aluminum bottle with a screw off cap and has the consistency of water, it's pretty hard to get it into your hair before it runs through your fingers or sloshes out of your cupped palm while you're in the shower. Don't waste your money on this overpriced product that delivers no better performance than other salon shampoos."
1,Wrong item sent,"First they sent me someone's totally wrong item, no tracking and it took forever to get here. I still haven't received my actual order with the paid postage to send the other thing back. And I have no idea where it is. Probably not ordering from them again anytime soon."
5,memories are the best,"The Silver Grille -- it meant going downtown with your mom, favorite aunt, later on in life with your girlfriends -- and it's all there to see again, the recipes are wonderful -- I really purchased it for my 90 year old Mom and she loves it. At least we have our memories, if not the Grille."
5,east or west trance is da best,"u know it really takes me a royal ride when im in real trip and the 2nd disc 8th trak and also the fire wire- cosmic gate is really amazing, well trance is in my blood so slinky planet is one of my most crazy traks."
5,Best one volume reference on Pentecostal/Charismatic movents,As a Penecostal missionary and bible college student I have found this to be one of the best refernces on the market. I encourage those who adhere to Pentecostal/Charismatic theologies to buy this book.
4,Love this Headset,"I have not had any of the problems others have had. This headset always works, the sound is clean and clear at both ends. Yes, it may be slightly heavier than other Motorola models but it is comfortable and I do not notice the extra weight. I like the AAA battery because I use it for 2 weeks at a pop without the same issues my friends have with their newer rechargeable versions. After 2 weeks I put in another NIMH and never have run out of battery."
3,Decent but flawed,"I've owned several bluetooth headsets, currently I have this one, I talk on the phone a lot in the car and thats mainly where I use it, I like the concept of a replaceable battery, I use Nimh rechargeables and sometimes alkalines, here is the main problem, when the battery gets low but nowhere near dead the headset beeps incessantly even if you are on a call ! why cant it just beep once ! Otherwise the unit is good, the ear clip is Ok but not great, sound is good but could go louder, look elsewhere for a better headset."
3,Pretty good for FREE,"This is my first bluetooth headset and I picked it up for free (after rebate) from CompUSA about 10 days ago. I use it in my noisy car and have no trouble hearing; others say they have no trouble hearing me.The only bad things I can say so far:1. I have small ears and this unit does not fit snuggly. The unit flops around when I move my head and feels like it will fall off, although it has yet to do so.2. I have used it a couple of dozen times without problems. However, on one call, the sound transferred back to the phone (i.e., disconnected) 4 times in about 10 minutes. I'm not sure if the phone or the HS805 was at fault."
4,Great wireless solution,"This product is a great solution for drivers. The only draw back is that it sits loosely on the ear, otherwise its very simple to use and quite powerful. Battery life is great because you don't have to recharge it after every 3-4 hours of use. Strongly recomend it."
2,Echo and didn't fit well,Echo between mike and earpiece and it fit loosely - didn't bother with other aspects just straight back to the vendor.
2,Not as good as the H300,"Purchased this item when the price of Motorola's other AAA battery device, H300 went up (for whatever reason). Big mistake. The two devices may look similar, but the HS805 is not as dependable as the H300. My main gripe with the HS805 is that after about 4 months, I could not get it to connect, without deleting it from my phone, and then re-pairing it. After doing this repeatedly every time I wanted to use my bluetooth, I said Forget It, and ordered not 1, but 2 H300 devices."
1,Dont Buy It,"Terrible bluetooth. horribly low sound in ear, outgoing is ok. floppy on ear, limited functionality, fair battery life. Some issues syncing. Bought second 1, it was dead from start. threw away. I cut the back off the old 1 to hear better, it helped but not worht it. buy other.The only pros are that you can replace the AAA battery anywhere in the world easily; it has a pretty good range with new battery, easily 20 ft."
3,HS805 Review,"-Easy to use. Connected with ease. Buttons and navigation are easy pretty straightforward.-Flimsy feeling on your ear, like it will fall off at any time.-Not very clear with my Sony T616."
2,Cool first headset... except for echo!,"Yes, this was my first bluetooth headset, which I was eager to get after upgrading to my first bluetooth-capable phone, the Motorola E815.I love having no wires and the voice-activated dialing capability. Trouble is, my callers don't want to talk to me because the echo drives them crazy (though I hear no echo on my end).I'm considering ways to block the sound travelling between the microphone and earpiece to stop the echo (and avoid making another headset purchase)."
2,ECHO... Echo... echo... e...,Motorola's attempt at Bluetooth failed. EVERYONE I talked to was annoyed by the echo. It is an instant echo caused by the microphone picking up the earpiece. Your voice doesn't echo. They hear their own voice bouncing back. Pity... A small amount of foam inside could have solved the problem.
4,Pretty Impressed,Just received this last night. I have the Motorola E815 and the set up process was simple and straightforward. Was familiar with the earpiece in a matter of minutes.With regards to the echo others hear. I did ask people if they heard anything and it was an intermittent issue. But overall this is an issue with most BT earpieces and very minimal when you lower the earpiece volume.For the price I picked it up for (25.00) this was a steal and impossible to go wrong.
3,"Good, but not enough volume","I like everything about this headset (quality, size, price, battery powered, battery life) except the max volume. It works great in quiet environments but I cannot hear it in the car or in a moderately noisy environment. My other complaint is that the battery lid tends to pop open on occasion when you dig it out of your pocket. Battery life has been excellent and I love not having another device that needs a charger... I have plenty of those already! I give it a three because being able to hear it is very important and I can't understand why they would design it this way and I have good hearing."
4,You get what you pay for,"While certainly not the best headset out there, it's far from the worst, either. I got mine free with my new Motorola RAZR V3, and it seems to be very adequate. It paired with the phone immediately, and has had no connection problems so far. I has good range and good reception. The earpiece is surprisingly loud, though this does cause that annoying echo if you're not careful. Setting it to a lower volume fixed it for me. It hangs on my ear quite comfortably considering there's no padding, though it is a little loose as previously mentioned. More an annoyance than a problem, as it hasn't fallen off or anything yet. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this headset as a low-cost solution, though I probably wouldn't buy it for full price."
2,HS805 headset mike too weak for Treo 650,"This headset pairs just fine with the Treo 650, and I didn't notice a lot of static (though there is a little bit). The main reason I'm going to have to return the item is that the microphone volume is too weak, and there's no way to adjust it. Bummer!"
4,Love this headset,"This headset is very convenient and comfortable. I really like the fact that it uses AAA batteries, so I don't have to mess with another charger. It's so comfortable on my ear that I sometimes forget it's there. I wear glasses and some headsets interfere with them, but this one does not. It's range is much greater than I expected. I can easily go 20-30 feet away from the phone through walls and still keep a very clear signal.One reviewer mentioned the battery cover breaking, and it does look flimsy, so I have been very careful with it. Otherwise I am very pleased with it."
4,Great Headset for the price,"I just purchased this headset on sale for 24.99 and I love it...fits well, works great. To sum it up I called my 86 year old mother who can't hear well from the car in the pouring rain and she says ""I hear you great"". Need I say more."
2,Good price - poor execution,"Let me first say, that I have always been a fan of motorola products. I am sad to say, that my bubble of consistant engineering marvels and high qualty is now been burst.805 is great in price, can't beat it.The problems I had were:1. Pairing was difficult, and I lost signal2. Sound quality produced an echo.3. When I spoke there was a hissing noise.I wish Motorola would have been produced this to the same standard as the 820 or the 850"
3,"Sturdy and stays put, but doesn't have drain holes!","I purchased this shower caddy in 2007, and it has been in continuous use in my shower for the past 5 years. It is holding up well, no broken pieces, rust etc. and it still looks like it did when it was brand new. The shelves are big enough for two bottles on each, and the ""hooks"" on the bottom hold a loofah well but not a razor. (or at least not that razors that we use). It stays put and doesn't tip over at all. My only complaint (and it is a big one for me ) is that the shelves do not have drain holes, so the water stands in them. The shelves are about 1"" deep, so the water works it way into bottles that stand on their lid. It also gets mildew and soap scum if I forgoet to ""empty"" it every day (which I do by clumsily holding onto all the products in the shelves while pulling it sideways to drain)."
4,Choose your model well,Be sure to see if your gun (maker and model) is listed in the abbreviated contents listing before ordering. The book worked well for me because I needed specific advise on a Marlin 336. Thgis is not a genaric book.
2,Average but useable,"The format is good and the style of layout and illustrations are user friendly but the author sometimes assumes advanced tools and knowledge in what should be an introductory text.Much gun repair can be done with a combination of hand and small electrical tools, very slowly it is true, but with less chance of catastrophic failure. The examples are a narrow and limited in range compared to the clssic texts which are more generic about fixing problems rather than particular models of fire arms."
4,"When a little kid stares down three BIG guys, you know who's gonna win","This is a typical Munsch book - weird setting, over-the-top pictures and reactions, cool sound effects, repetition in threes, and lots of funny.It's really like an intro to tall tales, this book - we've got a kid who eats seven fried chickens and pancakes for breakfast, and who wins a pie-eating contest against a lumberjack, a truck driver, and a construction worker (who turn various colors and fall under the table) and, naturally, pie for lunch. Gotta love it :P"
5,A classic in modern land planning and landscape design,"This is one of the best introductions to landscape design for those outside this field of specialization. The photos are strikingly beautiful and McHarg describes his approach to land planning in readable style accessible to general, technical readers outside of planning. My own interst was the history of modern American landscape architecture.Note:If you like this you may also like modern historical analyses of the world's major cities like Kostof's 'City Shaped', 'City Assembled' or Rogers' 'Landscape Architecture: A Cultural History.'If you are interested in American city planning, try a history of F L Olmsted's major works.(w/ photos of Boston's & Chicago's Emerald Necklace parks, NYC's Central Park, etc)"
2,not as good as i expected,"this highly recommended book started out as a compelling read, but became something i had to force myself to finish. it seems to be a series of lectures strung together, which may have been interesting as lectures, but is not cohesive enough to be a book. the good information is lost amidst the rambling style."
1,Worst Madonna song!,"I still don't like Justify My Love by Madonna. It's too steamy and repetitive. Even the Public Enemy sample that Lenny Kravitz used for the song doesn't work. Madonna's whispering comes off like sweet nothings on this song. I didn't like that controversial video either. (...) I love a lot of Madonna's singles albums and hits, but this song is just lousy to me, just a bunch of crappy, cheap, monotonous, faceless, bland junk!!!!!"
3,"Hate the song, love the remix","This CD is where ""The Beast Within"" premiered before it was showcased in the highly erotic number on ""The Girlie Show"" tour and it was later remixed into the erie intro to 2004's Re-Invention Tour. This mix makes the CD worth buying."
5,Fascinating read,"Scholarly, evocative, fascinating read. This is one of my favorite texts addressing art, gender, and our sense of senses."
3,Interesting! (up to a point),"I have been reading Classen out of academic interest. Mostly because her books deal with areas very few other people seem to touch. I can highly recommend 'Worlds of sense' and `Aroma'. Very, very good books about things you've never thought of.Color of Angels also is one such book. It deals with 'worldviews' on perceptions of the divine. Especially the first half is very readable, highly enjoyable and refreshing. However, at a certain moment I happened to be sitting in Cambridge, on the shores of the Cam, thinking: Yeah, this is all nice and interesting, but so what? In other words, at a certain moment the book lost its fascination. For me that point was the mediaeval details, however interesting, yet less stimulating.Please understand me well. This is not a bad book. I think for those interested in the topic it might be an exceptionally well crafted, highly readable, well constructed and substantiated book. For me it was a very enjoyable distraction. Up to a point."
4,"Nice, but not for everyday use.","Wow this soap has quite a wallop to it! It is very strong smelling, with kind of a manly floral cologne scent to it. I really enjoy it, but I feel it's too strong and masculine for everyday use. The seller was prompt in shipping, and the soap was carefully packaged."
4,Spiritual Cleansing,This soap has a mild scent to it. I use it when I am going out of the house to keep the evil and bad things away from me and prevent bad energies from coming into the house too. I do this washing myself with it in the shower and praying the Lord's Prayer a couple of times. I feel refreshed every time I do this. I keep it in a soap box.
2,these are my second pair i ordered,"first pair came in the wrong color, second pair came and theres a scratch thru half the letters ont he left side of 'Versace"" making them look like knock offs from mexico. ugh! not worth the shipping for me to send back again! what happened to quality service these days. obviously i like designed stuff, the reason i like it is its consistently NICE quality"
5,Love them,Great effect! if you have kids these are great. All he kids in the neighborhood make their parents bring them to see our house.
3,Nice but Cartoonish,"I thought these cat eyes in the top window of my house would look awesome. While they ARE pretty cool, they look a bit cartoonish. I also bought Sinister Sid, a set of sinister eyes with a creepy green face, and they look much more creepy and real. Still, the cat eyes aren't bad."
2,Fun but small,"I bought this item for my son's 5th birthday party we celebrated outdoors. The slide was easy to install and the kids loved sliding on it. However, the slide was smaller than what I had anticipated. Also, when the child reaches the end of the slide, they can ""burn"" their skin when in contact with the plastic seam along the edge of the slide. Regardless of these details, the kids had fun and played for hours."
1,Disappointment!,"This water slide broke when we were filling the reserve at the bottom. What a piece of junk. Maybe it was a fluke, but it tore before our kids even got to slide down it."
1,Waste Of Money,"I am not one to leave negitive feedback,but,this Slip and Slide lasted a grand total of about three minutes before the seam on the bottom split and could not be repaired. I have had other Slip and Slides for my grandkids(I buy one every year)and have never had a problem this quick.VERY POORLY CONSTRUCTED AND A WASTE OF OVER $30"
1,Flimsy!,"After about 15 minutes of fun with the kids, my nine year old daughter landed an inch to close and the slide ripped up the middle about 8 inches, ruining the tunnel of water and ending the short lived fun. The defect is nothing that the 2x2 inch patches can handle and it ruins the functionality of the slide.Very disappointed with this product..."
2,Misleading images of the product,Only reason i brought this product as one of the product image says 2 slide boogies included but they are not included in the product. So i had to return the product since its not worth spending $30+ just for the slide alone since you can get same product at Toysrus for $10.
1,"Disappointment, cheapo","What a bummer. The picture shows 3 foot water geysers, we can get 6"". Called the city to check my water pressure and we have 83 psi which is quite high! Returned once thinking it was a fluke, new one is exactly the same except one inflatable raft was made without a port to fill with air wtf! So sick of cheapo companies cutting corners. We notice the lack of quality and we don't like it wham o!"
1,Not slippery,"This piece of junk isn't even slippery. I had to cover my kid in baby oil to get her to slide more than a few inches at a time. But even then the grippy plastic prevented her from sliding. This was in a downslope, mind you. The water system doesn't even cast water into the slide. It spits it the opposite direction into the grass. P. O. S."
1,not a good idea,I was very disappointed. The product was much samaller than implied. Fitting two children on the slide was very difficult as they would just bang into each other trying to dive on becaseu there wasnot really enough room for two sliders at one time. The product lost its tether to the ground on the first run and the teathers were just not strong enough to keep it in the ground. It started to come appart within 5 min. The sprinkler at the end demonstrated on the box was a mere dribble into the pool area which did not blow up well or hold water. horriable product.
1,Not worth the money,I bought this slip n slide for my grandchildren ages 4 and 6. It was to replace the one that my college age son broke last year when he slid on it. Well this one didn't even last the afternoon before the section spraying the water broke when someone stepped on it. Don't waste your money. You'll end up just putting a sprinkler near the slide to get water to spray all over it.
1,Unhappy Buyer!!!!,The kids had a blast on this slip n slide....but it was ripped and torn at the seams within the first few hours of use. The construction of the seams are very poor. I would not buy it again!!
3,not what is pictured,"We received a different model than pictured. The picture has the water spray from the middle, the model we received has the water spray from one side. The water does not reach the second lane very well. Making the second lane not very slippery."
3,Save your money and go with the single.,Only the orange side gets wet b/c the water from the middle totally over shoots the yellow side. So I would just stick with the single. So much for racing....
3,"Kids had fun, but didn't last very long","My kids were very excited to try this. We purchased the inflatable boards and they used them every time. By the end of the day... the seam in the middle started to pull apart. My kids are 8 & 9 and are lightweight and did not abuse the toy, it just wasn't very durable. They did have fun while it lasted though."
5,Cool,Direct fit replacement for my 93 pickup with 22RE. Stock sensor was faulty and this fixed the problem. Use thread sealer when installing to prevent leaks.
5,I hated it!,"I HATED IT because I'm addicted to ""A Good Deed in a Weary World"". I can't take it out of my cd player. The tunes are funky (which I like) and the lyrics are so much fun to listen to. 5 out of 5 definitely!"
3,Sophomore Slump,Ian Polk's second season of Noah's Arc was a godsend to this GBM and eagerly anticipated. If the 2nd season's writing wasn't so up and down I would have made it to the end of it's LOGO run which is why I bought the DVD's to watch at my leisure. This being historic to an extent is also why I'm recommending it.
2,Noah's Arc,"I was hoping to like season 2 `Noah's Arc' a little more than the first. Sadly, I have to report that this show only works on one level and that is on how hot most of the cast is. Once you get past the attractive looking cast there is very little to recommend this show. The acting and writing lurch all over the place, at times it resembles a poorly written episode of `Saved by the Bell'. Wilson Cruz does his best with this material and actually manages some genuine emotion. He is poorly under used by the show and Hollywood.It's worth buying as African Americans are starved of this type of material, but don't be fooled, we deserve better than this...Don't we?"
1,NOT A GOOD VENDOR TO ORDER FROM,This vendor did not send the DVD that I order... they did not give in explenation to why it was not sent... it took them weeks to responed back to me... I did get my money back but I felt it was a waste of time to order from them... I would avoid ever buying anything from this vendor...
1,I thought it would never come..,It took a whole mouth for it to get to my house and when it got here i send it back.. but they made sure they got there money from my card 1st wayy before they send it. i think the dvd is good but i rather buy it somewhere else then on amazon!!
3,GENERATIONAL GAP,"Having fallen in love with season one of ""Noah's Arc"" and with its characters, I eagerly purchased season two of the series. As I viewed season two, I became keenly aware of my own generational gap with the show. The actors that played the characters of the show were still very appealing; however, I no longer gave a ""fig"" about the characters that they were portraying. To me, the producers had put fourth a sincere effort to make the show more hip and appealing to the younger crowd. Thus, I felt very ""let down"" with my ""love affair"" turning kind of sour. Oh well, I guess love is not always easy. I'll truly miss this show!"
5,Noah's Arc - The Complete Second Season,"Hilariously funny, impeccably stylish, and deals with many of the aspects that relationships in general has to face - that is to say their differences, apprehensions, and infidelity."
4,review,Loved season 1. so i ordered season 2. does not play on my blu ray player but can watch it on my dvd player
1,Kindle Version Poorly Formatted,The Kindle version of this book has hard breaks at the end of every line making it very difficult to read because the text splits in the middle of every other line rather than where it logically should.
4,Emergency Wedding by Marion Lennox (Large Print Mills and Boon Medical Romance),"Description from the book back cover:Wanting to work to support her coming baby, Dr. Susie Ellis returned home to Whale Beach, Australia, where she owned half of the doctor's practice. Instead of finding only her partner in residence, Susie discovered Dr. Darcy Hayden there as well! Darcy needed to stay in the area as his young son was ill, and as Susie was heavily pregnant - neither of them could leave. But regulations meant that only Susie or Darcy could work at the practice - unless they were married. Susie realised an emergency wedding was the only answer - if she could get Darcy to agree ..."
3,Good for car cd players-bad w/ headphones,"I have this and bought it to hook into my Alpine car CD player. It sounds good in there. It sounds AWFUL if you listen to it by headphones. So, if you want it for personal listening do not buy!"
3,fatal flaw,"I really liked the design and features of the Rave mp2100 and the price is very attractive, but back to Best Buy it went the next day, after I wasted hours trying to get three different computers to recognize it, and I am no computer novice. The really bad thing, that makes me mad, on the box it just says parallel port interface, then you get inside, and it's well, it has to be configured as ECP or it won't be recognized at all instead of just working slower. I tried ECP, EPP, ECP + EPP all to no avail. This player was made for a USB interface, using the parallel port is kind of like designing a great sports car, and then making run on kerosene!"
1,LOOK OUT -- IT DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS NT!,"I think this is a well designed piece of hardware. Sound quality is great. Layout of menus -- great. Just one minor, itsy-bitsy, little problem that no one at sensory science or amazon.com bothered to mention -- IT DOESN'T WORK WITH WINDOWS NT OR 2000! It's not like there's some way around it. The software just won't install. At all. GOD, I'M SO FREAKING PISSED OFF!"
2,There's better out there,The unit freezes and makes a VERY loud noise too frequently to be used. I dont need my ears blown out by a defective product. The unit also feels cheap and is light on features.
1,Worst Tech Support EVER,"OK, this product comes with a 90 day warrenty. Doesn't seem so bad does it? What they don't tell you is that this product is VERY apt to get a slight memory error which causes the screen to show many lines. To remedy this problem, all that is needed is a memory flush. HOWEVER, this can't be done without sending the product in to be fixed. ...you will see in the faq section that for almost every problem this device can have, their only solution is ""send it in for repairs.""... NOT A GOOD DEAL!"
2,cool looking but limited connectivity,The Rave MP3 player is cool looking and it does sound alright. What it lacks is connectivity. You cannot use it with Windows NT. You can use it only with Windows 95/98 (probably works with MS Bob too). It uses the parallel port (disconnect your printer here comes the MP3 player).
1,Piece of Junk,"Amazon recently sent me a raveMP player... It was defective, so I returned it. The next MP player didn't even have a mp3 player in the box when I got it... The customer service at Rave (Sensory Science) was terrible, plus it was long distance and they put me on hold, which made me none too happy. I'd recommned to someone willing to spend this kind of money, something with higher quality like the Rio player or the RCA player."
2,Good thing I got if free (buy a minidisc recorder),"I received this free from e-music. Mine did everything it said it would...not very impressive. They are essentially mini hard drives. It requires connection to a parallel port? Doesn't work with Windows 2000 or NT? This company is not thinking of what the customer wants, but rather what they can deliver at the cheapest price. I have a portable minidisc recorder which makes much more sense for recording. All the minidisc folks have to do is figure out how to interface it with the USB port so that you can download songs rather than record them. (it takes 74 minutes to record 74 minutes of MP3's rather than 20 seconds per song)."
1,Terrible Customer Service,"I can't say whether this is a good product or not...I can't get it to work. Turns out its software won't work on Windows NT. They don't talk much about this up front; they only bury it in the fine print. While this might not matter to Win 95/98 users, the real concern here is customer service. When I contacted their CS, they first promised me NT compatability by ""the end of November."" No deal. Now they make no promises whatsoever, and don't seem to care if or when they ever will have NT software. Messages from their CS dept. come back terse, uninformative and not remotely helpful. And worst of all, in this day and age, there seems to be no activity on their website...no updates, no refreshments... just static. This company is not ready for prime time."
2,UGH!,The only thing I have to say about this product is don't get it! I received for free from a promotion and that is all the money you should spend on it. The sound quality is awful. All you hear is static. The thing broke only after two months of my brother using it. I would not recommend wasting your money on it. Invest a little more and get the Nomad II or the Rio 500. I have both and the Rave does not even compare.
1,What a piece of junk,"6 hours later, still no go! there own software to for ripping doesnt work. There is no help section, customer service is terrible."
3,RIO PMP300,"All I know is that my Rio PMP300 (32MB) is pretty durable. You can drop it from 5 feet and all it does is stop playing. It plays again after you press ""play"""
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,IT TAKES AN HOUR TO DOWNLOAD A SONG. IT TAKES ABOUT TWO HOURS TO FIND OUT THAT YOU HAVE TO SWITCH A PORT WHICH IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. INSTEAD YOU SHOULD BUY A MINI DISC WHICH YOU CAN STILL DOWNLOAD MUSIC OFF THE INTERNET AND DOWNLOAD MUSIC OF A CD PLAYER OR RADIO.
4,"Good Value, could use better implementation","I bought this about three weeks ago. The software installed easily, and downloading .MP3 format music is a snap. I use 64kps encoding (I walk to work in a busy city -- the ambient noise level is high so I'd rather trade number of titles for sound quality). I've been very pleased with the sound quality and ease of use. The controls are relatively simple and intuitive, but some basic procedures -- setting the clock for instance -- could be made easier.The major downside is the constuction of the instrument. The battery case cover slips off from time to time and it does not seem to matter how I secure it. Sooner or later I'm going to lose that part. The overall feel is flimsy, but having said that, the fact is that it has bounced around in my pack for several weeks and been on several plane flights with out a hitch.Overall a pretty good value."
3,"Good amount of memory, hard to use","After months of my brother telling me to get a Rio MP3 player, I bought a Rave MP because I thought it had more memory. If I had known that there is also a 64MB Rio, I would probably would have gotten that. The buttons are too small on the Rave MP making it hard to use when you're running or working out. And you have to take out the battery to put in a different memory card. I'm not too fond of the hourglass design either. But, it can hold an hour of music and it sounds pretty good."
1,Check the Return Policy!!!,"We had the worst experience with FURNITUREBUZZ. If U happen to not like the furniture or changed your mind shortly after U orded it, be ready to pay 3 TIMES MORE!!!! We did!!! They charged for shipping to us (which is understandable $39.44) and then also for the return $28.30. TOTAL $120.74 including the cost of the furniture piece!!! Don't waste your money. Even if something that U orded was inexpencive...We've never heard or experienced that a customer has to pay for a return. We REFUSED the package - DID'T OPEN it! Nobody charges for that!!! We're very, very upset. This is a robbery! FurnitureBuzz is the worst experience we've ever had!ALWAYS CHECK THE RETURN POLICY before U order!!!!!"
1,Where's the Amaretto??,"Astounding that this coffee has no smell or taste of amaretto whatsoever. I know it's decaf but it doesn't even smell or taste like coffee. It's bitter and has an odd flavor. Worst of all, you can't return food items. I wasted $36."
1,Bad deal,"O K, I bought 2 of these batteries,they were both used and didn't hold a charge.So I wrote my displeasure to Accessory One. They apologized and said their used batteries got mixed up with the new ones and said they would send me 2 new ones. Well I got my batteries today and not only were they not new they were worse than the first 2 I bought. Now I have 4 bad batteries. I will not buy from Accessory One any more."
5,"Awesome item, awesome price","I purchased this battery for my LG225 cell phone as recommended by the Sprint store. They no longer carry this battery. The original battery was $45. I got this one, including shipping for about $11.00. It works well and was a deal."
4,Works Great,Ordered 1/26/2010 Received 1/30/2010- fast. Looks new but maybe not fresh so I took off one star in rating because received DC060911- old? Holds charge fine for a few days. One day after full charge and after over one hour of continuous talk time in LG VX6100 battery indicator shows 3 of 4 bars- good. Battery was not in boxed packaging material just a small clear plastic bag of same size as battery- neat and perhaps less costly to mail? Battery says from Japan Manufactured in Korea. Has LG hologram so I guess its genuine.
4,A Little Worn..,"Battery looked a little worn, but works great...ordering and shipping went very smooth...for the price...cant beat it...thanks..."
2,LG OEM Battery,This is the second battery I got in 4 months. Also the charges don't last but a day or two. The battery I got with my phone lasted a few years and the charges lasted a week or two. But the price for this battery is great!!!
5,Super deal...,OEM -- exactly as advertised and identical to the battery that came with the phone (VX8300). Came in the mail in just a couple of days. LOTS better than paying Verizon $39.99+tax ;^)
1,Wrong battery,I placed an order for LG Battery 1000 mAh and received 1100 mAh battery - SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT!!! My phone doesn't recognize this battery so I simply wasted my money. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY BY PURCHASING FROM THIS SELLER!!!
5,Great value,"I looked high and low for this battery but could not find it at a good price until I looked here. Excellent value. Perfect condition. I have bought other size batteries from them as a result, all with great outcomes."
4,"""Keep It Together,"" a great song with a good message...","""Keep It Together"" was the last single from Madonna's hit 1989 album ""Like A Prayer."" This is an up-beat song with a very positive message. The song talks about how important family is, and never to drift apart, because ""your family is gold."" The remixes aren't anything spectacular, they don't change the original song too much, but remixes in the '80's, were usually just extended/dubbed versions of the original. I recommend you buy this single if you are a Madonna fan, and I recommend everyone to buy her excellent ""Like A Prayer"" album."
2,Kind of Lame,"For the Queen of Pop this song is dull. The song is about her making it big but now not being able to trust anyone but her family. ZZzzzz. I'm not sure any song by someone this famous and this much of an attention hog that makes her whine because of her life, poor me style, is a hit. Skip it on the CD."
2,Not a research based book,"This book was not based on research. It was a point v. counterpoint of the positions on drugs and the effects they have on people. It is an opinion book, not one filled with facts and figures based on solid research."
3,Overall,"Pretty good, although it could be better, it seems to me that this is an underground rap group b/c i personally have never heard of them."
5,Good Info!,"I'm new to wedding photography, and I try to read everything I can about certain techniques to use. This is a good book to introduce me to wedding ablums! I would recommend this book - great illustrations and information about every aspect of wedding albums. Buy it!!"
3,Mostly promo for high end wedding photographers,"The book has no real overview, but jumps from the method of one successful wedding photographer to the next, fifteen in all. I was surprised how little insight was provided to digital albums; many of these photographers still shoot film. The albums shown are extremely high end, probably not the best fit for less established photographers. I much preferred ""Digital Wedding Album Design Guide"" by Kathy Woodford, which is a more nuts and bolts book."
5,great book,"it have hundreds of tips of whats best for your bussines, it talks about how they started as photographers, how they started to make money, bad an good propaganda.....GREAT so far....."
3,Not what I expected,"This book profiles a number of successful wedding photographers, how they got started, and their styles of work and selling. I did get some helpful tips out of it and got to see some lovely photographs and album pages, but I wanted more how-to tips about planning photographs for and designing wedding albums, with information about the various computer programs available and the companies that sell wedding albums."
5,Great ideas,"This book is just what the professional photographer or anyone in the album making profession needs to refine the art of designing and putting together brilliant wedding albums. Techniques and suggestions are given by numerous captains of the industry on areas such as creativity, appeal, marketing and profit stimulation. This vast array of examples means that anyone can easily formulate their own style that meets their own needs. You've spent much time and money becoming the best photographer you can, this book will allow you to display your work the way it deserves."
4,A miracle worker?,"Yes! I hated math and the very thought of taking it again made me queasy. But thanks to my college's graduation requirements I will once again be sitting in an Algebra class by Spring. Algebra had always been like a foreign language to me, and due to the fact that it has been 10 years since I took high school Algebra, I figured I'd better do some quick brushing-up. This book makes Algebra so accessible...so do-able even. It's divided into 51 practice lessons (the answers are in the back), starting with the basics and gradually moving up in complication. The author clearly breaks the problems down and explains how to work them. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because although I realize mistakes happen in publishing, I found it pretty inexcusable for a book of this sort to have incorrect symbols in the few places where typos did exist. Granted it doesn't take much to figure out what the author intended but that doesn't make it any less frustrating."
4,Suprise Gem,"I was amazed to find only one review of this movie. I first saw ""Grief"" on TV a few years back and I have a real fondness for it. Although I've heard it labelled a ""post-AIDS gay flick"", it is really so much more. Due to a tight script and some great performances (namely Jackie Beat and Illeana Douglas) you can't help but get sucked into the sleazy world of tabloid TV where the extremely likeable characters work on an early ""Judge Judy"" protoype. As the main character deals with the recent death of his boyfriend and the stresses of working in no-budget TV we gain insight into life and love in the 1990s. I don't want to give too much away about this movie as I feel if you watch it without any prior knowledge (like I did) you'll experience something quite wonderful. I liken the attitude and general feel of ""Grief"" to that of ""the Opposite of Sex"" and think they are both smart and excellent."
3,A very unusual film,"This movie to me is more to the tune of ""The Boys in the Band"" and other EARLY gay films that focuses on the gay lifestyle, ""flaming style"" in the big city. I'm still trying to figure out why I wanted to see this one. I think I must have bought it by accident. Nevertheless, it is a spoof about a group of very openly gay and lesbian people working on the staff of a crazy flamboyant TV soap Opera. It showcases their relationships, lust and personality traits. It is ok if you are into films of this nature. Not really my cup of tea but it did hold my attention enough that I didn't want to turn it off without seeing the whole thing. Perhaps that was in the hopes something would show up later in the film to take away the disappointment. I don't know. An indy film, thus quality is not expected to be at Hollywood status and of course wasn't. Not bad all in all if you like this type of production. Be sure to read to description carefully so you know what you're getting."
4,Great find!,"This was a really ""cute"" film. I wasn't expecting much, so was pleasantly surprised to find good acting, good plot, laugh-out-loud lines, good-looking actors (male & female), and a ""message."" Don't overlook this sleeper. Needs a different title though."
2,Disappointed,"I love the nostalgia value of this pull toy, but I am extremely disappointed in the length of the pull cord - a full 6 inches, that's it. I can't understand why Fisher Price could make a pull toy with an impossibly short pull cord. Purchase only if you're ready to replace the pull cord."
2,"Good product, poor shipping.","I really like the product, however, it took them two tries to get it to me unbroken. The coasters look nice, but even the set I have still has tiny chips in it from poor packaging and shipping. Definitely buy these in store and not online."
1,Don't Bother,I ordered 4 sets of these coasters and all had chipping problems. One was even broken completely in half. Not sure why I didn't listen to the other reviews.
3,It's plastic- how is that retro?,"At a quick glance, combined with the packaging, one would assume this toy is wooden. It's not- it's plastic. Quite disappointing, since it's supposed to be a classic toy brought back. Somehow I doubt the original was plastic, so why is this one? I didn't notice that before I opened it (the stickers a really well done) so I can't return it, and neither did Grandma, who bought it and thought it was wooden too."
2,attempting return,"i wanted to get my daughter this toy because i had one to play with as a child at my grandfathers house and i adored it. when it arrived today i was so excited. i pulled the item box out of the shipping package my heart sank. it is all plastic! No wood at all. The details are all stickers, not a good idea in a toy for toddlers. no where worth what i paid. will not be taking it out of the box (hopefully the seller will take it back) so i am giving it two stars at it MIGHT still function as well as the old one, though i truly doubt it."
3,Lucky Star Remix,"A-side: ""Lucky Star"" (U.S. Remix) (5:34)/B-side: ""I Know It"" (3:44). The A-side is also found on the newly remastered MADONNA album under the title of ""New Mix"". The song is similar to the original, however, it is a great item to add to your collection if you want a remix of ""Lucky Star""."
4,MADONNA'S LUCKY STAR!,"A true gem of the 80's and Madonna's career, Lucky Star is that simple ballad that rocked in its remix version. Flipsided by the remix version of ""Borderline"" this early Madonna track characterized the superstardom that would come in the next few months with the release of Like a Virgin!Trivia: Lucky Star was written by Madonna on a yellow paper after she got a deal with Sire Records through her DJ friend Mark Kamins (who produced Everybody). Madonna was so happy that day that she dedicated Lucky Star to Mark Kamins. This was according to a Madonna book written by Andrew Morton.long live the queen!"
1,Don't Bother,Information presented is too limited and general for the price. Spend twice as much and get 20x the useful info.
3,Complicated and Hard to Understand,"If you want a good commentary on the Ramayana, Richman'sMany Ramayanas: The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asiacontains much more relevant and easy to understand commentary. The articles, in this book, I find to be much more complicated and hard to understand for someone who is not an Indian/South Asian/Hindu Text scholar."
4,Boats with an open mind,Excellent book of unusual boat designs.I am a bit disappointed that the Water Van did not get a mention.
2,Boats with Mindless Drawings..............,"While the book contains meaninful text, the drawings are nearly useless unless you want to go blind. They are virtually illegible due to there font type and size. Unless you want to use to a magnifying glass or produce enlarged photocopies, save your money."
5,"Really cheery, classic; made well and feel good","I bought these for my aunt, who has matching dishes. She is fairly picky about her flatware--can't be too big, too small, too heavy, etc. She LOVES these! I used them myself on a recent week-long visit, and I was seriously tempted to buy some for our home, as well. They feel good in your hand, seem to be sturdy and well-made, aren't too heavy (but not at all flimsy, either). I think the best part is the color, which is a really great, cheery red with the classic white speckling. Adorable and functional, perfect for camp use or home (so buy extra sets)!PS--I've also seen the blue and green versions in a store, and both of those colors are great, too. The green's sort of a Granny Smith apple green."
4,Cracker Doesn't Disappoint,Almost as riveting as the British version. Some episodes are unique; probably created for an American audience and culture. Definitely worth the price.
3,Not Quite as good as the original,Robert Pastori is not Robbie Coltrane. Even Mr. Coltrane's guest appearance in on of the latter espisodes would not hvae saved this series. This collection is only for a completest. But if you are making a decision I would buy the BBC series.
4,"Not a remix,, but extende version","worth having if you like the song a little longer especially Open Your Heart,,,,,includes,,,Gambler, Crazy For You,,,,,"
4,I liked it,"There is an exploration of the existential in Madonna's work now that shows a definitive maturity. I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it. Two, Marianne Williamson talks about that people who become legends do so because they tap into the concept of what the human consciousness is available to, needing to develop and that rings within all of us. It is that work that interests the rest of us."
3,Better Days not best,"Paul Butterfield's Better Days band was Paul Butterfield's early '70's band and oh so much different from his blues based bands of the '60's. Better Days had Geoff Muldaur, a folk singer (and ex-husband of Maria Muldaur) + Amos Garrett, a singuluar guitar player that had the sweetest sting since Chet Atkins (It was Garrett's solo on Maria Mulduar's ""Midnight on the Oasis"".This CD has some fine harmonica work by Butterfield but is mostly noted for the quality of the songs. ""Small Towm Talk"" is a heartbreaking lost classic and well worth the entrance fee to this wink/grin of the '70's."
4,Love it!!! - If the plate wasn't broken...,"I recieved this candle set as a birthday present from my friend. It smells soooooo good! It also looks great and is a perfect gift for somebody, if the plate wasn't broken. Just make sure that you check the plate before you bring this item home because the candles are so heavy sitting on the plate that it was cracked when I opened it up! What a disappointment. Now I have to try and find this at another target store because not all targets have the same things in stock!"
5,Tabletop Decor,"This was a gift for a 93 year old mother who, even at her age, loves attractive things in her home. While this is intended as a definite Feng Shui product, it is just as well suited to adorning the coffee table, mantle, end table, etc. It is attractive and appropriate for almost all, if not all, schemes."
2,Feng Shui Candle Set,"I purchased this item at the retail store for the same price listed on Amazon. I have to say I am very disappointed with this item. It is much smaller than I had anticipated, and the scent(s) of the candles is not very pleasant. The look of the item is nice, just like the picture. This would be okay for a bathroom or a small room, but not for the place I had planned to use it. You may want to go to Target and view and smell the item before purchasing."
1,disappointed,"I bought these candles in the store. When I got home, I set everything up and lit the candles. In less that 30 minutes, all 5 candles had burned to half way, and the strings the medals are on had caught on fire too. The entire thing was on fire (a big fire). I was able to blow it out, and take it outside to the trash can. I have bought Target candles before, and love them. I am not happy!!!"
5,Great Gift!,I bought this for my sister-in-law for her birthday. She absolutely loved it! She said that the candles smelled great and it looked very nice in their apartment.The estimated shipping time said that it would not arrive until after her birthday but it actually got there several days before (and the plate wasn't broken!)
2,Smells great - for a few hours,"Bought these as a gift, so complaints were left to a minimum, but the wax is so soft they burn down EXTREMELY FAST. She's gotten a couple of good uses out of them, and the taller candles may get a fourth burn, but the short candles are ""bye-bye"" after the third lighting.Smells good, though."
1,Not nearly as nice as the one in the photo.,I ordered this item online because the picture made it look so nice. What I got wasn't nearly as nice. The plate was not cermamic as stated in the listing. It is actually a very cheap looking metal one and looks nothing like the one is the photo. The candles don't have that nice marbled look to them. They are flat colors and the colors don't exactly match the one's in the photo. It didn't come with nearly that many rocks so it ended up looking very bare. Overall I could have made a better version of this product for less than what I paid. I was very disapointed by what I got.
2,Not what expected but kinda ok,"I received this set as a gift from my wish list. The set and candles was smaller than I initially thought it would be based on the picture, and the candles don't look marbled like they do in the photo. They do however have a nice scent. I am glad I read the other reviews though. I won't be burning the candles.Overall i would day I am slightly disappointed."
4,Nice candle set,"The candles are nice, but beware - the set is much smaller than it appears to be in the photo!"
1,Can get MUCH better elsewhere!,"I bought these candles because I thought they would look nice on my end table near the couch. At first, they did look nice. However, when I lit them they melted so much within the first half hour that the wax spilled all over the plate, off the edge of the table, and on to the floor. It took me an hour to get the wax out of the carpet!The plate and rocks were ruined too, covered in blobby candles and melted wax.My suggestion if you buy this set - DO NOT BURN THE CANDLES! Use it as a decoration only."
2,Very disappointed with this candle set,"I purchased the candle set because I thought that it might look nice on my dining room table. The set that I pulled out of the box did not match the picture on the front of the box. On the box, the set looks like the candles have a marbled texture-however, the candles that I recieved were solid colored (not marbled) and looked very cheap. Word to the wise: if you want the set to stay looking decent, don't burn them. We only had the candles lighted for 20 minutes and they already started to lose shape. Wax spilled into plate-and now we have plate full of dilapidated candles- and stones stuck in dried wax. I am very disappointed with this purchase-and will no longer buy any product from this brand."
2,Somewhat disappointed in quality,"I bought this set because of the colors and the value. It looked beautiful and smelled wonderful but that's where the &quot;nice things&quot; ended. I lit all the candles and within 1 1/2 hours it was ruined. They all dripped down onto the next and either snuffed out the flame or the melted wax dripped all over the rocks in the tray. The wax is of poor quality. If you never light these, they're fine but once you light them be cautious of dripping wax."
1,Not what I expected,I bought two sets of candles from a Target store in Minneapolis and was very pleased. You can't imagine my suprise when I recieved my online order. The candles looked nothing like what I had purchased previously. They didn't even look like the picture(not marble). I let the candles burn for about an hour and half of the candle actually burned. This did not happen on the others I bought from the store. I only regret that I gave some away as gifts and can not return them.
3,"looks good, burns bad","the candle set looks good as a display, but the candles are too close together to be burned properly on the tray it comes with. i just burned mine so the wicks were black and left it as a display."
1,Not for burning,"Within 20 minutes these candles were completely melted and now my carpet is a mess. More for decoration and with that being the case, these candles are too expensive for what your getting."
4,Dark and moody,"For a low budget film, this one really packs a punch. There is enough blood to make the audience feel the character's pain. This film is dark and moody, with a concept that is truly disturbing. What happens in this film makes it a psychological thriller that will stay with you. The characters all have motivations for what they are doing, and the victims are a bunch of unique people. They all act as you would expect in this situation, which helps the audience empathise with them, feel their pain and frustration. The film plays out with twists and turns that are both believable and unexpected. Despite a slow pace at the start, the film picks up speed once the violence begins. This makes for a buildup of tension that drives the story to its conclusion. A brutal exposition of what people are capable of doing to other people."
4,Great starter set,"Product looks just like the picture, but does require some assembly. The top box actually has these two bars that insert and lock it. It was a little smaller than I had thought, but a great starter tool box. It does not come with any kind of drawer liner,but I bought that pretty cheap via Amazon."
4,Better late then dented,"Product arrived a week late, but was delivered with only a small dent. It is easy to see why so many complain about tool chests arriving with dents, but this is more of a fault of the shipping Co. then Amazon, though the manufacturer could take this into account with better packaging. As for the product, it's good quality at a great price."
4,Great value.,Really well built. Surprising. Drawers are a little stiff but really a bargain. Not flimsy like the harbor freight units.
1,What are the dimensions?,"My review is of the web sites that cut and paste the same descriptions of this tool chest, but don't give the dimensions of the unit. I'd give that about 1 star. As for the unit, well, I can't say because I won't buy it because I don't know if it will fit where I need it to go."
2,Will not last,"Don't ever move - wheels, like rest of chest, is not very durable. I eventually took the wheels off and pushed into corner until I eventually replaced it. Worth what you pay, but you will likely be unhappy in long run if you don't pay at least $500 for something this size. So, my advice is to buy something smaller (such as, say, aStanley Consumer Storage 512100 12-Inch Tool Bagand/orStanley Consumer Storage 512100 12-Inch Tool BagorStanley Consumer Storage 020800R FatMax 4-in1 Mobile Work Station for Tools and Parts) until you can afford more. Then, don't get anything less than theExcel TB2605X-Blue26-Inch Steel Roller Cabinet, Blueand it's associated toppers."
2,Roller metal Tool Chest - 2 Pieces,"Not the greatest quality....and, it was a little banged up....Craftsman much, much better, but cost too much....for the money, this one is OK.....JB, Waldorf MD"
1,Very Upset,I have said this before but I guess they don't want people to know. They carged my credit card and I never recieved the product. I even emailed them 3 times with no answer. Took 2 months for me to get the money back.Never would by from them again.
1,warped pan,I bought these pans because my friend has had them for a long time and loves them. They must have changed the quality of the doughmaker products. Mine warped the first time I used it. Returned for a refund.
2,Use caution with this book,"Throughout Dr. Shealy's book, he continuously touts his products. After a while, the repetitious branded names of the SheLi TENS, Dr. sHEALy's Essentials tablets, Dr. sHEALy's Youth Formula tablets and his Biogenetics Magnesium Lotion makes his book sound more like an infomercial than authentic informative research. Whenever there is product pushing involved in a book like this an alarm of caution should immediately sound. There should be cause for concern that findings may be created or embellished as a way of selling them instead of providing accurate research and truthful information."
3,Meh,"Ikea would have you believe that legions of brilliant, unknown designers toil tirelessly in arctic sweatshops across Scandinavia to bring you items you didn't even know you wanted. This book is the next best thing to an anxiety attack over swedish meatballs at the local Ikea megastore.My criticism is that there is little rhyme or reason to the pieces chosen for inclusion. The book just haphazardly marches through: here a chaise lounge, here an end table, here a sconce grafted to a candelabra. If it were better organized with more descriptive text and designer bios including guiding ethos, it would be an excellent introduction to Scandinavian design."
1,Can't see it because I have the wrong region.,"I want my money back. I can't watch the product I have bought!!. What a Shame!, I would love to have it!!. It says that I have to check the region, because I am in Spain and doesn't work"
4,BEEGEES,Good DVD.Answers a lot of questions about the band I never knew.Interesting review and songs to boot.Great for BeeGee fans.
5,Excellent Bee Gee's DVD,"This DVD was so good, it takes you back to when they first began,you see things told from there Mom, When I put it in I couldn't stop watching. This was made before the death of Maurice but it brings you pretty much up to date before his death. This is one that you will love to have in your collection, if you are a Bee Gee's fan."
5,Loved It!,I have been a fan of the Bee Gees since the very first time I heard the beautiful blending of their unique voices. This DVD provides the background on their lives to make the music even more meaningful. I have viewed it many times and still enjoy every minute.
3,Good buy at the time,"Got a good deal on this at the time. The player is good for WMA and MP3, but the FM radio is weak. The main station near me is so strong, the unit cannot differ between other stations.The other issue is that you cannot set up a play list externally from the player. You must download the files to the player then set up the play list. Not that this is bad, but I want it all! You can name the file alphabetically to get the list in a good order.Overall it seems to be a good unit. I still do not like having to tote around the USB cable, but 10 hours of music, well I don't change it that often."
5,absolutely perfect!,"this game is easily the best game i have ever played for the game boy color. it has simply awesome graphics for the console, and packs a punch. it still contains all the stealthy action from the PS version and all the weapons. it has 180 vr missions and 13 regular stages. once you beat all the vr training missions it unlocks a sound mode where you can play any sound in the game. it is an easy game with classic bosses that aren't hard at all. when you beat a stage you can go back and play it again. if you want a perfect game for the game boy color get this one!"
2,Ok game,"This game is ok. It's by far much worse than the playstion version. It was not a good follow up, but if you haven't played the PSX version, this is a good way to get to know the game and plot."
1,JUNK,"Received this and it never worked, wouldnt even turn on. Save your money and buy a better quality MP3 player."
1,Bad Seller,"Book arrived too late to do my assignment. Smells old and musty. Seller never stated that book was out of print.Contacted seller 4 times to return the book, heard from them once and never receive instruction to return the book.Had to file an Amazon A-Z Claim. Would not recommend this seller."
4,Very Nice,"This is a very nice gold chain, great length and weight. The best part was that it arrived so quickly."
1,Damaged,"The figure themselves were fine but the packaging was damaged and the email to ToyRus that they listed for complaints turned out to be bogus. As I had ordered it for my cousin who is a collector, it was useless to him and he gave them to his nephew."
2,Written Poorly,"Although this book present some useful knowledge of UMLand Design Pattern (nothing novel though), I am sure the authorsdid not spend much time on it. I downloaded the code examplefrom their web site, most of them are half way done. I donot mind that a book only print some important part of theirsample, until I found that is all they have. Code sampleis an important part in such a topic+explaination+sample typebook. Anyway besides the code, what else is their owncontribution?I would recommend Fowler's UML Distilled to learn UML and GoF book for Design Pattern. There is not much special about implementing them in VB, especially in VB.net.A request to the author: please do not write a new editionin VB.net. If you are too busy to write a book, let the peoplewho have the time to do the work."
2,A good idea but no follow through,"This is an ok overview of UML (the Cliff Notes approach) and design patterns. I picked up this book because I hoped to learn more about design patterns and how they relate to Visual Basic. Most of the books, so far, have been based on the C/C++ world. The first section on UML covers the basic aspects with only simple detail. The design patterns take up the rest of the book, but the same minimalist approach is used. The code samples in the book are only partial and don't really give you a good idea of how or when to use this type of pattern. The text is clear, and if you only need an overview; if you have been chosen by your project manager to give a presentation to 25 people on design patterns and Visual Basic and it will only last two hours, this book is the one to buy. If you actually want to use patterns, choose Microsoft's Visual Basic Design Pattersn by William Stamatakis."
1,Would Give Negative Stars If Possible!!!,"This CD is a total rip-off - real flea-market trash.These are not the original recordings and, most likely, not the original artists.I guess I should have been tipped off by the low price but I thought that no one made phony CDs like this anymore.Put me down as a sucker and don't make the same mistake I did!Save your money and time and avoid buying this piece of garbage."
1,NOT the original recordings,"I received this as a gift from someone who knows I like doo-wop. The fine print at the bottom says ""new stereo recordings by the original artists"", and you can tell immediately that they aren't the original recordings.For someone not familiar with all the nuances of the originals, these recordings are not exactly *bad*... but anyone who grew up listening to the originals will wince at every difference and mutter ""That's not how it goes!""Or maybe it's just me. Now get off my lawn."
4,Wonderful,All the Special Editions I get from Silhouette are wonderful and Lilian Darcy is someone to add to your authors list.
5,A must read for anyone who is involved with Asperger's,"This book has a wealth of information regarding Asperger's Syndrome. It iswritten in an easy to read style, but not so simplistic as to not hold the reader's attentnion. Asperger's comes in many varieties and degrees and the people-primarily children at the time of diagnosis-exhibit many different and unique behaviors. This book helps people who deal with this syndrome understand and relate to their special needs person with compassion and caring. Lots of tips to make life with Asperger's a bit easier as well. If someone were to read only one book about Asperger's, this should definitely be the one!!"
3,Not what I expected,"Asperger Syndrome is a lot more subtle than the book would seem to indicate. Yes, Asperger is related to autism, but it is hardly the debilitating issue that this book would seem to imply.This book makes it look like only children are diagnosed with this and have a seriously debilitating disorder as a result. AS is rarely such a disabling disorder and many people are never diagnosed with it except through adult counseling.The information, though suspect because of the range of disability, is still very good and very well presented."
2,Predictable collection,"While the packaging on this is nice (complete with booklet with bands discussing Dystopia)I found it to be pretty predictable as far as content. Thought the album is comprised of multiple bands - it pretty much could have been recorded by a single artist. There is one stand-out though - the INdex Remix of Stromkern's Night Riders. In truth though, I think the only thing that makes it a stand-out is its lack of the stereo-typical raspy/angry ""terror ebm"" vocals made famous by Suicide Commando. No one does it better... and this CD is proof of that."
3,Madonna Fever,I love madonna. I've wanted this single for ever but when I listened to it it wasn't my favorite single I've bought. My favorite remix is track 4: Shep's Remedy Dub. It's not one of Madonna's best singles but it is good.
3,Sadly missing the video mix,"The title says it all. It's not a total loss though, it still has extended mixes of the still hot ""house"" album version of the song. The video mix can be found on the Germany pressing of the ""Rain"" single under the alias ""Edit One""."
4,Amazon track listing is wrong,The track listing provided by Amazon is not accurate. See reviews below for correct listing.
5,Another great release,"Obviously, I am just buying all the ""official"" cds I can find, and this was on the list. It's great."
1,Why do people keep doing this ?????,"Peggy Lee's version of ""Fever"" is one of the most sexy songs I have ever heard. This song didn't need to be remade & I was surprised when I heard Madonna's version. I didn't like it & I like Madonna's music. Eddy J. Cooley (the orginal singer of this song) is pretty good, but Peggy Lee took it to an awesome level that can't be matched. Lee's version is sexy, simple & gets your mind racing. It didn't need to be remade."
1,Background music too loud.,"I watched this video one time and was very disappointed in it because of the loud background band. Bonnie Tyler's recordings on a cd are very good, on this DVD not so good. I doubt if I will watch it again."
4,Canning up pickles could not be easier,"Norpro 6 piece canning set, has been a real asset while canning up pickles for the first time. The magnetic lid grabbergadget saves my fingers from the hot water. It easily pulls the one lid from the water and holds on until you lay itover the jar. My second favorite it the jar holder which safely hold the jar well you put it in and pull it out ofthe very hot water. A great set at a great Amazon price."
4,Solid Canning set for Good Price,What you need to jump start your new canning obsession! This is the best price you will probably find out there online.
4,"This Kit Works real Good,With Both Sizes of Mason Jars","This Kit ,Seems to Work Great with both Sizes of Mason Jars&will Help keep Your Hands from getting Burnt,when working with Your Canner"
3,Read Package Carefully,"I picked this product up during the workday and when I returned to my office to put it on I realized that the product can only be used OVER clothing and not directly on the skin. I cannot wear a large, white patch over my clothing in the office, so I now have to either go get something else or wait until I leave for the day to use the patch that I got. The outside of the package does say that you should not place the patch directly on the skin, so I guess this is my own fault for not reading the entire package, but I certainly won't be buying this product again."
3,Coffee Break Set,"The candles smell great, but were a little smaller than I expected. I also dont think the plate that they come with really matches the candle set. The stones look very pretty with the candles, they would just look better sitting on something else."
4,Good gift idea,"Overall, I was satisfied with the candle set. I bought it for my girl friend, and she loves it. However, it is over priced, you pay alot for the little you recieve."
3,A Little Disappointed,I got this set for Christmas and was a little disappointed when i took the candles out. They look nothing like the picture! It still looks good on my endtable though.
1,Not crazy about candle smell,"Love the dish and use it offten with other candles. Not so crazy about the coffee smell of the candles. Actually, that was my mistake. Like coffee and the smell but only in the morning."
2,Image in rear view mirror may be different that it appears,"Does not look anything like the picture. All solid color candles were sent to me....BOOORING! Oh well, it was a gift anyway."
3,Candles too small,"Looking at the picture of this product, you wouldn't realize how small the candles actually are until you pull them out of the box. They are deceiving in the picture. Otherwise, the scent of the coffee/mocha is amazing and lingers in the whole room."
2,Perhaps I got a dud.,I discovered after buying this item that due to the way the dish is curved the candles never stood straight up. They kind of leaned on each other and looked odd. I returned it.
3,Good decor if you NOT planning to lit it,"The set is pretty, very good coffee fragrance but candles are smaller and thinner then i expected. I lit the candles and after some short period of time wax was all over the plate and rocks. The whole display became ""dirty"". Bottom line - great set for decoration and fragrance purposes but do NOT lit the candles!"
2,Why not the other way around?,"Although I personally find the idea of the ""Sarmatian Connection,"" as it has come to be known, very interesting, I don't find the evidence really all that convincing. For one thing, the Caucasian oral traditions of the Narts are recorded only from the late NINETEENTH century - why does no one ever seem to ask whether the direction of influence was the other way around? That is, perhaps the Nart traditions were derived from the Arthurian stories, which were popular all over Europe, rather than the Arthurian stories having derived from the Nart cycles. It seems to me that would explain the parallels without assuming hundreds of years of ""crypto-transmission"" from pagan Sarmatian cataphracti to medieval Christian bards."
1,black thermal underwear bottoms by Rothc,Although the price was very reasonable the product quality evidently suffered. The waist is way too low and the elastic is very weak. Might be more comfortable if worn over comfortable briefs. I was very unimpressed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
4,The king of Elvis collections?,"They just keep coming. Well good I say. What we really get here is his ""30 #1's"" disc, obviously the biggest hits, his ""2nd To None"" disc, which was arguably the less popular hits, and a third disc of what didn't make the first two. For the casual fan who wanted more than they got on ""30 #1's"", this is an excellent collection, and is probably all that many may ever need. However the fanatic will forever be missing select tracks on something like this, even with 80 songs. For the most part ""Hitstory"" is so amazing it's really hard to fault. But personally, without ""My Happiness"", ""Young And Beautiful"", and ""Mystery Train"", I feel this is a tad incomplete. Thankyouverymuch."
3,same old same,I GIVE THIS 3 STARS BECAUSE IT IS ELVIS!BMG REHASHES ONCE AGAIN 30 NUMBER ONES AND SECOND TO NONE AND A THIRD DISC OF MATERIAL THAT WE HAVE ALL BOUGHT MANY TIMES OVER.THEY COULD HAVE RELEASED SOMETHING WITH THE BACKGROUND VOICES REMOVED MAYBE WITH NEW INSTRUMENTATION AND PRESENTED A FRESH SOUND.WITH SUCH A STEEP PRICE THIS CD IS NOT LIKELY TO ATTRACT ANY NEW FANS.THEY CAN DO BETTER!IF THIS IS THE ONLY COLLECTION THAT YOU HAVE BY ELVIS IT IS A GOOD SAMPLE OF HIS WORK.
4,call me myra,"David writes a intreguiging tale that holds the interest of the reader throughout. The tale amazes with it's twists and turns, and the main character is just that, an amazing character that keeps you guessing what the next turn and twist will be. It all culminates with a surprising and exciting ending to a well told tale."
5,A strong focus on advanced projects/concepts--Wonderful!,"If you bought Lemay's Teach Yourself Java, get this book to go truly MASTER Java. This book covers SO MUCH that Lemay missed! Like any great programming book, this book is timeless -- if for no other reason than the TONS of hands-on stuff and project walk-throughs...Regardless of where Java the language goes, take this book with you. Norton & Stanek TRULY understand OOP & OOD -- there are strong appplications of Yourdon OOD methodology to Java programming, especially in the advanced applet and application design chapters that is terrific."
5,The Best Guide to Java Available Today,"This is a practical hands-on book! I REALLYLove it! Terrific coverage of all the essentials, plus lots of extras..."
3,okay but not for the novice,"This guide to java programming was informative and thorough, however, i would not suggest it for a user of little or no prior java experience. Many of the explanations of java concepts I claim are difficult for the novice user to comprehende and I would recommend something a little more simpler."
3,"Good, but typos...","The book is not really bad, but it has many typos and errors which confuses the reader in many places.."
2,Not for beginners,"With over 15 years of programming experience and no experience with Java, I found this book difficult to follow. I normally like to dig right in with numerous examples so I can test what I have learned. This book has few meaningful examples and when they do exist, the author uses concepts which have not been covered yet. Confusing! After reading half the book I am now searching for a more beginner book."
5,A serious book for serious people,Norton & Stanek are the dynamic duo when it comes to Java. If you look at the other options I think you will agree this is a great book. Solid use of object-oriented design and object-oriented programming concepts. Terrific practical advice from two industry authorities that know what they are talking about.
4,Moves everywhere and nowhere!,"She's tall and lithe-impressive for Gameboy platform. However, this is why I give it four stars, it's too easy to get lost. It's a tangle town-chambers and ladders galore. If someone can post some good tricks and cheats, it might be worth the hassle(ugh). In the meantime, I'm floundering, amidst great graphics though. The colors are lush. Then again, the creatures are wimpy and the music lasts a whole 5 seconds. Once you start, the only thing you hear is the gun, the explosives, and poor Lara stumbling. The moves are tricky! Good luck with this one! Believe it or not, I'm glad I bought it. It's addicting in it's ability to drive you insane!"
2,Not Even Close to Flat,"The Norton stone is not even close to flat. Prepare yourself for hours of trying to flatten this crooked stone. Purchase many sheets of coarse wet dry sandpaper because you will need them. Once they are flat, they do a decent job, but then you have to flatten them repeatedly between steps to get a truly sharp blade. I spend more time flattening than sharpening with this thing."
2,Sauce master does not meet claims,"The sauce master makes good tomato juice but not tomato puree. At least 1/4"" of pulp is lost with the skin-way too much to waste. Went back to just canning diced and whole tomatoes the old fashioned way. Also tried the grape spiral. Too many solids and too cloudy and the spiral clogged up with skin/seeds and it did not come out the end-just sat in the spiral so became hard to turn as it compacted. Would have to add another step and strain with cheescloth to get clear juice. Going back to hot water method of making grape juice where I get perfectly clear grape juice with little effort. The pumpkin screen also takes too much pulp with the skin. Not into wasting food. Can get just as smooth pumpkin puree with a hand mixer and no waste. If you just want tomato juice, it is fine but don't expect much else."
3,disappointing.,"I've had the sauce master for about 3 years. I have used it for applesauce and squash. I find a get a fair amount of waste ... seeds and skin, mushed and gritty, going right through the screen into the finished product. It makes squash a great texture but I have found you must scrape out the seeds and scrape the flesh from the skin before you put it through the saucer to get ""clean"" squash. Only used it for applesauce once because of the amount of skins coming through into the finished product."
1,This machine is not up to the tasks expected of it.,It only came with the finest screen for berries and the need to make apples go thru it was nearly impossible.It did keep 5 boys busy for hours but made nothing useful.The base mount was flimsy.
3,"Leaks, need low bowl, rust, too much waste","Hard to say if I should give it a 2 or a 3 or maybe even a 4 if I want to be kind. So I will go for 2. I returned this hoping to find something better. The problems from worst to least: (1) It leaks out of the crank arm... not much, but enough to leave a 5 inch stain on my hardwood floor after a few hours. (2) I did not even get into the rust, but it will do that. (3) You need a bowl that is about 3 inches high to catch the puree (I can live with that because I have a pasta bowl that worked.) (4) Waste, like someone else said. (5) It kept gumming up. (6) Forget about doing small Romas (Juliet).Pro: (1) It worked much better than the Foley Food Mill (a HORRIBLE choice!... the rust and the tomatoes that will not go under the mechanism so you go round and round.) I canned several quarts of tomato juice or puree but made a huge mess. (2) Great for the price, but I need more and am willing to pay for it. Sorry! I wanted to like you."
1,Rusts,"Except for the main body (which is aluminum), the screen and other parts are made of plain old steel... they rust like mad even while washing.States in instructions you need to spray whole thing with oil after every use.Also, very hard to crank and plastic pieces are very flimsy.I returned mine since I don't want to give my friends and family the gift of tetanus."
4,Assessment in Speech-Language Pathology,This textbook is full of lots of information however it's a good idea to look at the table of contents to find exactly the area you are looking for. You will find a variety of areas it will cover.
4,needed book,"The book came around when it was expected, and it shipped for free, so that was nice. It also arrived in great shape (it was new), which is also very important.Thanks."
3,New?,"The book is in pretty good condition, but looks beat up and/or used. I thought I was purchasing a new book, I may have been mistaken. No worries, it will still do its job!"
5,Favorite Tweezers & great case,"This is my 2nd purchase of Tweezerman tweezers. My first pair was ""LTD Point Tweezers"" which remained perfect for a few years but when they fell from the bathroom shelf one too many times they mis-alligned. Having become a Tweezerman convert, I went looking for for a replacement and saw this set as a good deal. The leather pouch is nicely made with an easy-to-use magnetic clasp AND most importantly to me, when the case falls the tweezers are 100% protected. They say petite but they are a nice, easy to hold size, not too small. I'd recommend these to friends."
5,Please don't stop making this set.,"I'd question the person who would discontinue such a great lil' set of tweezers. Sephora discontinued selling this, I'm assuming that it's to sway people into buying two separate tweezers which is 2x's the $ or to direct people to buy their store-brand tweezers, which are just as expensive I believe. This set is a much more affordable alternative to getting the larger individual ones and easy to keep together and put away."
3,Nice Interface but Performance Issues,The program is very easy to use and very powerful. It takes a lot fewer steps to post process files than in photoshop and I can process dozens or hundreds in a sitting and very rarely have to turn to photoshop because Aperature's own tools are powerful. The interface is elegant too. The problem is speed. I have a dual core 2.8ghz iMac which is well above the minimum spec for the program. Most of the time Aperature is very fast but sometimes it will grind to an absolute halt. It might take three minutes to load one image. The problem seems to be one that is getting worse as I add more and more pictures. When it goes down the whole system gets so unresponsive that I feel like i'm on a 1986 Mac Plus again.
5,Aperture 2.0 Rocks!!,"I've used Aperture since it's initial release. It won out over Adobe's product only because it became available first and I had a mighty need to organize my photos and work flow. My frustrations with the initial release of the Aperture 1.x series was non-intuitive menu items, viewing problems and sluggishness when downloading photos much less while running photoshop or some other memory hog. Aperture 2.0 is a pleasant surprise by a company that seems to listen to their customers. The menu items are much easier to understand and use and the performance on my Macbook Pro is not perfect but much much faster."
4,Aperture 2 Review,"Apple Aperture 2.1 is great. I can't believe how easy it is to make changes to my pictures and having them go from just looking good to looking outstanding. Also love the ability to export versions of my pictures with ease. The online tutorials really makes you appreciate the full capabilities this product has to offer. Before watching the tutorials, I thought I could just correct my photos with Photoshop, but now I can see how quickly I can make even difficult changes with Aperture."
4,Excellent Product for the Price,I have been using Photoshop Elements 3 and this product is a huge improvement. I find the controls to be much more intuitive and Mac centric. The Light Table feature is very helpful for arraigning layouts and seeing what sequence of photos will look the best. I would recommend this product.
2,A-poor-ture,"I originally bough this product for the web-publish feature in Aperture, but to my disappointment this feature is terrible slow if you have large files it could take hours to publish them to the web and It distorts your image size. Bottom line, don't waste your money."
1,"Slow, stalls out, not PhotoShop","After a long time using Photo Shop on my MacBook Pro, I was persuaded to buy and try Aperture 2. After a week of using this product, I have encountered numerous problems, including: It stalls out for no apparent reason when cloning; It is incredibly slow. Also, it has locked up several times to the point that I had to restart my computer to clear the problem.Stick with Photo Shop. Aperture 2 does not measure up."
2,Disappointed,i did receive the item quick I thought for the price I would get a new CD only to find the one sent scratched.
2,"Not as good as Picassa, which is free!","Apple is selling what should have been a free update to iPhoto. Worse, it confuses iPhoto into creating multiple copies of each photo, and has a schizo stacking algorithm.The omissions are glaring.No duplicate finder, no layers, weak cropping and poor output controls.They have, however, jumped on the ""pug-in"" train to up-sell even more ""features"" which ought to come with a program like this.No where near as good as even Photoshop Elements, and even slower, even on fast hardware.Apple should go back to photography school."
4,Great Deal for Solid Apple Product,"Always heard about the ease of use with Aperture from Mac users on various forums. While more of an Adobe user myself, when I acquired a Mac Pro, I decided to see if I could find a bargain on a slightly older version (2 vs. 3) to see for myself how Aperture compared to Photoshop/Bridge and Adobe Lightroom 2. Photoshop it is definitely not, more akin to Lightroom with many project based workflows and organizational tools. Photo editing is pretty basic and straight forward although the controls take a bit of getting used to on a Mac after having used Adobe/Windows 7 for so long.All in all, a great deal. CD arrive in a sealed CD case with required product key codes affixed to the case. Did not arrive in the retail box pictured in the photo on Amazon, but did arrive quickly. Removed 1 star for the missing box, sorry, I am a believer in WYSIWYG."
5,Awesome tool,"An awesome tool for managing huge numbers of photo files. Aperture also has outstanding editing tools to help you be more productive. With NIK plugins like silver effects pro, color effects pro and vivisa you hardly need to go to photoshop. Aperture is also a non destructive editing software so you know your original master image is always safe. Another big plus is that Aperture saves your edits as versions in small text files rather than clogging up your hard drive with full file sized copies. Aperture is one of the best software buys available considering just how much it can do and how much time it will save you organizing and searching for files."
3,Still waiting for RAW support as of 20 July 09.,"Owners of the Panasonic Lumix LX3 and the similar Leica D Lux-4 cameras are still waiting for Aperture to support their raw data input. Been a L-O-N-G time now, and still no support for those cameras.Three choices: continue waiting indefinitely, ditch the cameras, or ditch Aperture and go with Adobe's Lightroom. Very frustrating and/or costly for a professional product."
2,Complex,"I asked for this program for a present from my children. I tried to put it to use as I am sure once you understand it, it is a good program. However, I continue to use Iphoto on my MAC and PhotoSuite 4 and 10 on my PC for in depth editing. Aperture is more complex and not as user friendly as I thought it would be. It set on the shelf."
2,Unintuitive and slow,"When I can make Aperture work, it does nice things with photos. However, it is unintuitive and that makes using it painstakingly slow. My biggest complaint comes from my inability to make Aperture stop building thumbnails. That really slows it down and makes it impossible to perform some operations."
4,Amazing,"REally nice workflow, perfect visualization of the taken images, easy to use tools, very nice interface, shame mac can't edit the Lumix LX3 raw files yet, waiting on the update!!"
1,disappointed,"I purchased this version of the program, which is the previous one, to evaluate it and if I liked it, I would upgrade. Unfortunately the seller chose not to inform potential purchasers that this is some type of student version which cannot be upgraded. Thanks for the deception."
1,Not used,"I thought I could run this on my Tower 1.25 GHz G4 because of this statement, ""15- or 17-inch PowerBook G4 with a 1.25GHz or faster PowerPC G4 processor"" but as the statement says it has to be a PowerBook G4 . . .Oh well! ! !"
4,Apple's Aperture 2,"Very good product. Will take some time to understand fully, but quite an improvement over iPhoto. If you need to enhance your photos on the MAC, this is a great way to go."
1,I REALY REALY HATE THIS PROGRAM,"MAYBE it's ME maybe I am stupid, but I really HATE this program. I am MUCH happier with iPhoto. It is a RAM hog. Do not plan on doing anything else while it is running. It starts itself and I cant stop it. When I plug in my video camera which uses a format it can not even use it boots up and asks me if I want to download NO FILE DETECTED. It annoys me and I want it DEAD. THe worse thing is I will probably upgrade to 3 and it will be WORSE. If you are a recent convert to MAC and kinda miss Windows I recommend this program."
2,Aperture great until it gets corrupted (easy to do),"I was very happy with Aperture 2 and would have rated it 5 stars until it got corrupted while saving my 10,000+ photos to the vault which I do every week. There was no warning of a problem, it just crashed and has never worked since then. I have reinstalled it several times but with no luck. Where are all my photos? Who knows. Apple is totally unresponsive to my queries. When it crashes it gives a series of error messages in the report to Apple that it automatically sends. Each time the report is a little different. So the problem appears to be a moving target. I would now rate it as one-star, but a tiny voice in my head still holds out for a fix. FYI, besides the main photo file, I have it backed up to 2 vaults on 2 different hard drives. Aperture will not start, let alone access any of the main files, or the vaults.A search of the Web shows that this problem is not unique to me."
5,The secrets of living the awakened life,Hidden in this book are secrets--answers to the sometimes unheard questions that only our hearts know of.Eric Ashford is indeed a well developed poet. His words will touch your heart. His words will allow you to become who you really are.These poems are only a mere touching of Eric's poetry and works. See his website at: www.truevisionpoetry.com for more.
2,"Historically Interesting, Factually Incorrect","If you would simply like to have a copy of the historic footage featuring CBS heralding the Warren Report and believing if the government said something, it must be true, this is for you.But if you want to learn the truth about the JFK assassination, dont rely on CBS to give it to you.Dan Rather didnt know forward from backwards when viewing the Zapruder film (He reported the head of the President jerking FORWARD). The President's head, as we all know, was jerked BACKWARDS and to the left. Couple that with the giant exit wound in the BACK of his head (which could only have been caused by a shot from the front), and you can see why CBS didnt know shinola from that other stuff when it came to the Kennedy case."
5,Tracks are...,"Eargasmick Vibes (Real Hip Hop), Every Ghetto Same, Ulysses (Cerebral Funk), In Winter AIDS Attacks, Blackphobia, EGS (Instrumental)."
4,Fine Pickin',"Will Ray - Mojo BluesNever having heard the Hellecasters or any other Will Ray music, I gave this a spin to check it out and am damn glad I did. The guitar work is excellent with good variety and solid telecaster tone. Ray wrote 10 of the 11 tracks and I didn't find a bum track in the bunch. In addition to the great guitar featured on every track, Ray does a good job on lead vocals as well which is not mentioned by the other reviewers of this CD. Fine support from the band as well with appearances from musicians Ray has played with over the years. There is also a hidden track on the CD at the end - The Chicken Song about a chicken in a bar with some fine looking women all around him.Summary - great guitar, good songs, strong vocals, good band. Entertaining CD with a blend of blues, soul and country rock. It all just sounds like good roots music to me. Nice CD! Thanks Will."
2,Useless without Teacher's Edition,"Really a drag to be sold the student version without being told that it's a student version, and that it will be completely useless without the Teacher's Edition. It's a book full of unexplained numbers and pictures."
2,Another That Doesn't Fit,"I bought this hat, thinking it would be adjustable, so I could wear it on my 23.75"" head. Even though there's elastic under the tie in back, the hat was still way too tight. I tried cutting the elastic and just tying it, but now I can't keep it on.Continuing on my quest to find a woman's hat that will fit me."
5,WoW,This cd was very good. It was techno and I really like techno. The lyrics were pretty X-rated but all-in-all it was a marvelous cd! Two thumbs up!
3,ectasy is a tight cut,"I don't own this cd, but I might soon. My buddy owns it and the I think that it is a kicking cd. the ectasy just totaly gets me pumped up. It is a really good song and is a cd that you should think about buying if you like dance music. The only thing wrong is that there needs to be some more hits on there other than just like two."
2,Not quite right,"The DVD looked O.K. so I ordered it. First shock came when my Pioneer DVD player wouldn't read it. Fortunately the Panasonic DVD recorder did. Second shock when I inspected the disc and found they were DVD-Rs. The contents of the DVD were O.K. but video quality was quite poor, with many scenes having a bad washed out look. For die hard WW2 nuts only. i think Amazon should have at least stated the discs were recordables. The book is O.K. but the set not worth US$50 I.M.O."
1,The Wehrmacht in Russia,The quality of this footage is hideously poor. It is something that Amazon should not be selling for $50.00!!
5,Totally Awesome!!!,I am totally appreciative of Steven M. Collins research from a tremendous number of authors which shows that he poured his time with this book. I read it and am fixing to reread it to absorb more detail. He certainly knows about the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel.
5,This might be my new favorite.,"I watched this film for the first time a few weeks ago and was so pleasantly surprised!! It has romance, a well written and well executed plot, social issues, and the beautiful city of San Francisco as the setting. It's void of the stereo-types and predictability that plague so many films with non-white leads. I love the familiar comfort that exists between the two main characters despite their relationship being an 'extended' one night stand. They move seamlessly from care-free bike rides in the city to conversations about gentrification and race. This one's a keeper."
4,ENJOYABLE,THIS MOVIE IS RATHER SLOW AND IT'S EASY TO LOSE INTEREST. I FINALLY STAYED STILL LONG ENOUGH TO VIEW THE MOVIE IN IT'S ENTIRETY. IT ACTUALLY HAD A DECENT STORY LINE. I eventually purchased the DVD and am pleased with my decision.
4,pretty good for the price,"the juicer certainly looks good, all shiny stainless steel. it works pretty well too. even has a spout built into the juice collector, so you don't have to remove the strainer to pour out the juice.my only gripe is the attachment of the three juicing cones. it's great that there's a selection of sizes, but the cone just sits on top of the strainer. there are 4 locating posts on each cone, and the posts just sit in a slot on the strainer. there is no attachment feature at all. this means, for example, if you're pushing down on your orange or whatever, and it forms suction on the cone, when you pick up of the orange peel, the cone comes off the juicer. kind of annoying."
4,It looks good and does a decent enough job juicing.,"The quality of steel was better than I expected. It held up to my putting entire weight on the juicer. The cones are little to oblong to properly juice wide citrus fruits like grapefruits, but it more than makes up for it by having 3 cones. It's great for lemons and limes. It's okay for oranges and grapefruits, but it's good enough to squeeze a cup or two for a day."
2,Frustrating design,"The design of this item seems to have many frustrating aspects to it. By the time one juices a couple of grapefruits, there is mess everywhere, and it is difficult to take apart to clean, without creating even more mess. It was less frustrating to use it on oranges, but even so, I plan on using something else to juice citrus in the future."
5,So Pleased,This recording is only whale songs. It is fantastic and lulls you no matter what your doing. I use it for my ride home after work to relax me after a busy day. I decided this is where I needed to listen to this CD and I was right. No matter how badly the day went I'm relaxed and ready to face the evening after listening to these beautiful creature's singing to each other. Even the little clicks they make I find enjoyable and wait for them. Thank you for having such a wonderful CD.
1,Be Aware,"Be Aware, though Amazon.com is marketing this as the Illogic who brought us Got Lyrics, and Unforeseen Shadows, THIS ABLUM IS NOT HE. This is a trio from New Mexico, who seem to be completely unaffiliated with the true Illogic. Illogic's newest release, Write to Death, cannot be purchased on Amazon.com."
4,Historical Fiction at its best,"I picked this book up in a hostel while travelling through europe, at first by the cover I thought it would be silly, but after reading the cover and looking at the first couple pages I still thought so. I read it anyways and I loved it. Its the true story of a former confederate soldier, who knew many famous people and fought with and against them all, including crazy horse, sitting bull, buffalo bill cody and custer. I would recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know anything about the battle of little big horn or someone wanting to know more about the ogala indians. The battle with/against custer is a important part of the book but not what the book is all about. Its mainly about a soldier who becomes a member of the ogala tribe and all the things that happen along the way. read it!"
4,Pretty good deal...except....,"It's definately a great price for the 256mb, but the only complaint that I have about it is that it only reads 243.7 mb as the total mem available on the card. The performance so far is excellent. It is working well in my Palm Zire 71."
3,Have an Axim? This card might not work for you.,"I purchased a Lexar 256mb SD card several weeks ago. It worked great for a few days, and then died. The card was full of directories all named ""."", and it could not be reformatted.As it turns out, Lexar sources most of their cards from SanDisk, and the controller in those cards is not currently compatible with the Dell Axim. If your card was made in China or Taiwan, it will most likely only work for a week or two before corrupting. If you get a card that was made in Japan, you'll be OK.Lexar was very good about taking my bad card back, and I'm happy now that I have a Japanese card. It's rock solid and has no problems."
3,Go with another brand,"While the lexar works fine, the write protect slider tends to become loose, and can cause you to be unable to write. While this can be fixed with a little tape, it is likely better just to get another brand."
1,Read-only lock problem,"I had the same problem as one of the other reviewers below: The read-only lock on the card I received also stuck out too far. Whenever I inserted the card in my Kodak dx6490 camera the lock was pushed back, and I got an error message saying that the card was protected. I tried to make the lock stick to the unlock position in every imaginable way, and finally reaching a point of desperation, I pushed the lock to the unlocked position and broke it off. That didn't work: The card still appears to be locked, and is entirely useless.This situation got me stuck in Belize with nothing but the small internal memory of my camera, and I had to buy a couple of very overpriced 32MB cards while I was there.I can't recommend buying this product at all."
1,If you've got a Dell...,Let me add my voice to those who've already spoken about the problem Dell Axims have with Lexar SD cards. My Dell asked me if I wanted to format the card to make it readable. I'll never use that card again.
1,The slide lock key is too weak,"I bought it last april and i didnt realize that slide lock key was too weak, and now I try to write data but a message is about the data is secure (locked)."
5,Sticking with Lexar 256MB SD cards,"I purchased the Lexar 256MB SD card for my Palm Tungsten T and loaded it with a playlist of over 100 songs to carry on a trip (at least 5 hrs of music). Using the RealOne software (bundled with the Palm MP3 Audio Kit) all the tracks easily transferred from my PC to the Lexar SD card.No additional work, such as formatting, was required before loading the card. I didn&#65533;t encounter any problems during the transfer nor when deleting or adding individual songs. Also, my card is from China (as stamped on back) and it doesn&#65533;t appear to be defective in any way. It arrived in a factory sealed plastic casing that required scissors to remove the SD card and the UPC code. The Lexar card was reasonably priced, ... I plan to purchase another Lexar 256MB SD card for creating documents, spreadsheets, etc on my Palm."
3,Words of warning,"Not all Lexar 256mb SD cards are from Japan. The Japanese cards are fine, they work well and do exactly what it says on the tin. However if you are looking for Japanese-made SD cards, some Lexar 256mb's say ""Made in Japan"" on the packaging yet state ""China"" on the card itself. The Chinese cards look (and work) in much the same way as Sandisk cards - very slowly. In fact, the Chinese cards don't work at all in my Dell Axim X5 PDA...."
1,Stopped working after 4 days,"After a couple of days of it working fine, it just crapped out. I was uploading songs to it when I got an error message. It wouldn't detect it when I tried to format it and did not detect it in the G drive. So I'm getting it replaced and hopefully the next one will be better. I guess the previous poster was right, because it was made in Taiwan, not Japan. So I don't know, maybe the Japanese ones are fine, but I'd avoid the Taiwan ones. Which is what Amazon shipped me..."
2,Disappointing,"I found that the title was a little bit misleading as well. The word ""workbook"" led me to believe that there would be examples, exercises and forms to work from. Instead, the entire book is broken down into tiny sections that only DESCRIBE how or why a particular analysis or technique should be performed.Some of the information is purely common sense, and yet you are forced to read through a dry, overanalyzed, high-level description of it. For example, under the Project Documentation section, an explanation reads: ""Communication. With the documentation, all those who were involved with the project can be informed about the development of the project from beginning to end."" (Do you really need a book to tell you this?)Some good suggestions and a few good examples do exist, but you must wade through time-wasting, frustrating, non-informative text before getting to them.I think this book was nothing more than an ego booster and moneymaking scheme for a few E&Y consultants."
3,"Not bad, could be better","I'll agree with users who feel this book is dry, dry, dry. I also have some issues with the design of the book. There were concepts that I found confusing until I drew my own flow charts -such aids could certainly have been included in the book. There were too many bulleted lists that probably should have been numbered for easier reference and ranking. Where this book shines is on the mechanics on BPI; how to organize the project and the teams (although a good project manager should know how to do this), the sequence of steps to go through, and how to organize all the collected information.What is missing from this book, in my opinion, is discussion on Risk Management and Change Management. You can document processes and manuals and forms until you're blue in the face, but in the end, you'll have to get human beings to buy into the difficult task of changing processes to reach the future state, and there is little discussion of this."
1,Poor construction,"This pointer was great at first. Out of the box it was very bright and the beam could easily be seen from a perpendicular viewpoint. Afterwards, however, it dimmed dramatically. I tried changing the batteries, and that fixed it for a few seconds until it dimmed again. The optical components that I could get to (beam shaper and collimating lens) were very loose, which leads me to believe that the dye crystal that turns the laser green probably loosened as well. Spend the extra money to get a better laser than this one."
3,Not what is was looking for,"when i saw this item it said 2 miles, well it's not its only a 5mw powered laser pointer which really isn't that powerful at all it barely shines across my backyard and no where near 2 miles, if your looking for a laser pointer that does go that far get one that is 50mw or higher for longer distance."
5,Mating with knights???,"I haven't got this book. Still, five stars because I've read the review of someone who apparently did buy it and ""only"" gave it four stars, complaining about the fact that there isn't enough explanation about how to mate with two knights.Just wanted to inform this person that there is no way to mate your opponent with only two knights, unless he/she completely messes up him/herself.That's all :-)"
3,An introduction to solar applications.,This book gives an introduction to some of the ways solar energy can be used in everyday applications. If you have no knowledge of solar energy this is an OK place to start. It covers everything from solar water heating to solar ovens. The price is right.
1,Incompatible with Muvo2,"I purchased this card and the Sandisk 512 CF. Simpletech wouldn't format in the Muvo2. The Sandisk worked like a charm. Previous experience had this card fail in a week. I should have known better. I have never had a problem with Sandisk, but have been bitten twice with SimpleTech."
2,Wishful thinking &ignoring other user reviews was bad idea,"Hey...it's the cheapest one out there for the cost. I purchased mine here on amazon for $95 after rebates. I'm a young celebrity photographer and my shots of Charlize Theron & Marla Maples were taken however later they were unviewable. Downloaded into computer and it scrambled the images. The head was at the bottom of the photo and colors were highly distorted. As a regular consumer, it's ok but the shots I take need to be recorded correctly. Out of 300 shots in 2 hours about 50 were shot. If you want to talk, email me at mrandrewlee3@yahoo.com. I have to buy a more dependable one now. Maybe I'll go back to Sandisk or Lexar."
4,"Reliable, and an excellent value . . .","I use this card in a Canon 10D digital SLR camera, and have found it a very reliable performer. There have been no major problems either writing any kind of data, or extracting the files later. The larger capacity is great for digital SLR camera users. For the Canon 10D, a 6 mega pixel camera, maximum JPEG file size at the highest quality setting averages about 2.5MB, and typically about 190 images can be saved to the card. Using the card in a lower resolution digital point and shoot camera, capacity would of course be many times greater.As more files are written and the card gets closer to capacity, data transfer speed seems to slow down a bit. Still the card performs reasonably well even when taking a series of images in rapid succession, say four or five in two second interval. With a digital point and shoot camera, transfer speed should not be an issue.Competitively priced... Economical and reliable, SimpleTech's 512 card is a great value."
4,Brilliant synopsis,"Lynn Hoffman is one of the leading thinkers and practitioners in the field of family therapy and systems theory. Her book is a gem even though some parts may be a bit hard to follow. This is not because she is unclear, but brilliant."
1,Confusing and Difficult to read,"I found this book very difficult to follow and to understand. Hoffman's explanations are very long and contorted. Her information is good, but it is too much work to try to disect."
3,A collector's item,"I got this cd in Italy. It's part of the reissues of Madonna's early singles from the 80s. I can't understand why it was recorded with such a very bad sound quality. The remix itself gets better in the 2nd half, but there's no saving the sound quality. The B-Side 'White Heat' instead has a regular sound quality. I'm getting the original 12'' vynil and hope it was only a bad mastering of the cd. Since it's hard to find I advise you to get the CD anyway: the remix is nice to listen to."
3,Bad mastering,"The songs from ""Who's That Girl"" are far from my favorite Madonna songs, but I love Madonna and bought this simply to add to my Madonna collection. This CD has the extended version of ""Who's That Girl"" on it, but whoeve mastered this CD did a horrible job. The extended mix is barely audible. You're better off hitting eBay or your local vinyl dealer to find a used copy of the 12"" single. The sound quality is much better on the record than the CD. Who'da thunk?"
3,Not what I expected,"When I saw the term ""Assortment"" I assummed it mean't more then just one diameter. They turned out to all be 1/8 inch. Various lengths but one size. Since I was looking for 3/16 that didn't work for me. Wish I had known."
3,body spec review,The Glasses are nice they fit very well and the case is very handy when out on the move!They do seem quite a bit to large for my face they did not give me a size for these model glasses!
2,Not wide enough,"I ordered these boots in Wide since my husband wears wide boots in Caterpillar brand. But, these boots didn't fit as they weren't any wider than a standard boot. So, steer clear of the ""E"" width if you actually wear an ""E""."
5,Great interactive fun for two year old.,My daughter enjoys this tremendously. The package includes a remote control with 10 buttons. The screen gives the child options to choose from with shapes in the corners of the selection which correlate to the shapes on the remote. My 26 month old was able to understand within five minutes and was fully in control in the first fifteen minutes.This is good fun and learning at a very reasonable price for the interactivity.
3,likeable,"I do like Richard Simmons, and I love true to life stories of how people have lost weight. My only wish is that this book would have had more pictures.Otherwise helpful and inspirational."
2,note to self: learn metric system,"The bad: the lid does NOT seal. And, it's more of a measuring cup on steroids than a pitcher. Most recipes are designed for 2 qt pitchers. I'm too lazy to recalibrate for this pitcher."
2,Lid is useless,"Love the pitcher but the lid is entirely useless. 5 stars if you don't require a lid, the pitcher is sturdy and high quality."
3,The lid is a joke!,"Wow! I was really surprised with the lid on this. It is made from really cheap, throw away plastic. The measuring cup is really nice but the lid is ridiculous. I am so shocked that I am having a hard time even expressing how disappointed I am."
2,BPA in lid,"Te lid of this pitcher is not BPA-free. (Look at the recycling symbol on it). It also warps easily when put into the dishwasher, so you need to wash it by hand. Aside from that the pitcher is nice if you are not going to use the lid."
4,don't shake,"I bought this for my son's formula. It holds a lot and pours well, but you cannot shake the pitcher with the lid on it. The lid does not form a seal."
5,Charming and Informative,"I purchased this book when my baby was 6 months old but I really wish that it had been available while I was pregnant! The book gives simple, practical and straight-forward advice mixed with fun anecdotes from the hosts of ""The Today Show"". I've read quite a few books about babies and this one is my favorite! I will definitely be giving it as a baby shower gift in the future."
3,"More like ""surviving the first six weeks""","If I had never read another babycare book, and if I didn't have any friends to tell me what parenthood would be like, and if the Internet didn't exist, this book might have been eye-opening. But since none of those things is true, this book just confirmed what I already knew: the first few weeks/months of parenthood are incredibly hard. Thing is, I'm reading this when my son is 8 months old, so I'm kind of past that. There's very little in this book that applies past six months -- maybe a bit about solids or babyproofing but that's it. If you watch the Today Show a lot and you'd get a kick out of hearing parenting horror stories from the folks you spend your mornings with, this is worth checking out; otherwise, it's probably about what you'd get from any similar book."
1,Pointless even for banal entertainment,"This title is one of the poorest 'boyz in da hood' clones of all time. The acting is akin falls flat and insincere. It's a bit like watching a porno movie, without the reward of nudity.The weighty subject matter (socieconomics, violence and racism in an urban environment) has already been much more effectively addressed by similiar movies.Boyz in Da Hood, Colors, New Jack City and Juice were directed far better and had a more compelling and immersive storyline.One gets the feeling this movie was intended as a cult classic for gangsta rap movie fans, but it falls flat in even this aim."
3,"Stellar septet, rest not so good","These discs were recommended in the New NPR Encyclopedia. Unfortunately I had just listed to all of the Naxos Berwald chamber music which I reviewed and found to be some of the best Cds released by Naxos. With that in mind I could never recommend listening to anything on these disc with the exception of the quartet for piano and wind and the septet which are the only things not covered in Naxos and which are anemic in comparison. The Grand Septet is scored for the some forces as Beethoven's, strings,,clarinet, horn, bassoon. and may be one of Berwald's most beautiful chamber pieces with a song like first section and a haunting, extended slow section.So whether or not you but this set should depend on your wanting to own the septet.Please excuse typos I have a neurologic disease."
1,D.A.P. Did not work,Bought the D.A.P. collar with high hopes that it would calm my 2 year old Pomerainan.She's a bit aggressive with growling and jumping and I wanted something to calm her down.She's been wearing the collar for over a week now and there has been NO change in herbehavior at all.I was very disappointed with this product.
3,DAP collar,"It is hard to determine if the collar has helped with the separation anxiety. If it did, it was very subtle."
1,NOPE,"The collar did not affect my Yorkie's behavior at ALL. Now I know Yorkies are hyper to begin with, so maybe it doesn't work with dogs that are inherently yappy anyway. Also they have more of a ""fur"" than a thin coat of hair, so maybe it couldn't get close enough to his skin? Absolutely no difference in his barking and territoriality."
2,Worth a shot but didn't affect my anxious dog one iota,"I have a 7 year old puppy mill Brussels Griffon who has suffered from an almost endless variety of anxieties and phobias since puppyhood. Prescription medication helps, but I thought if I could go a more holistic route I would love to wean him off of his prozac. Unfortunately, although some dogs react positively to pheromones, it seems many (most?) do not. Worth a shot, but after 4 full weeks there has been no difference in his personality or behaviors."
3,Probably worth a try.....,"I read many reviews and it seems like it either works or doesn't. So, I tried it for my dog who was abused and is very skittish and afraid of every noise and movement. When I got the first one, she came out of her safe place and actually followed me around, etc. I figured the collar really worked or there was an amazing transformation. However, a couple weeks later, she seemed to go backwards. Since the collars are only good for a month, I ordered another one and also bought the spray. This time, there was no affect at all to either the collar or the spray. We've only had her 3 months and she's come a long way since we first got her so we'll just keep on loving her and trying to make her happy."
1,Simply doesn't work as claimed,Don't waste your money on this gimmick. I followed the instructions to the letter for my overly anxious 4-month old Sheltie pup and didn't notice ANY improvement after a full two weeks.
2,It didn't work for us...,For the money it was worth a try. Our dog hasn't responded at all and it's been about 2 weeks since we put the collar on. The reason we bought it was separation anxiety and we haven't seen any improvement. We are going to try the diffuser next as some people have better luck with that when the collars don't work.
1,Waste of money,Does the title say enough? Don't bother - this really does not work at all ... I mean AT ALL!!
1,Did not work,This did not work at all for my dog. There was no change that was noticeable. It did nothing to make him relax.
2,DAP DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT.,Bought this because I had read about how it can calm dogs down. My Shih-Tzu puppy is so hyper and my other one is very calm. I have not seen any difference and he has been wearing it a week. I would not buy it again.
1,Never buy from Medi-Vet,the product is expensive and worthless! the company does not stand behind it's product!Amazon is great in that they were able to refund our money when the Company selling the product was unwilling to even consider the fact that their product did not perform as advertised.
1,Did not notice a change,I bought this for our new puppy. I did not notice a change in his whining or barking. I actually thought it was a waste of money!
1,photo of product is deceiving to the eye,"I was very very displeased when I received my package of DAP puppy collars and it only contained ONE collar. The picture specifically shows two boxes throughout the whole ordering transaction therefore I believed I was getting two for the price of $16.83 I could have ordered One on another website for $9.99 So, in other words I thought I was getting a bargain. The images need to be changed because they are deceiving. Thanks once again for a waste of my money.........$22 total for One collar unbelievable. I guess you live and you learn."
5,Calm puppy,"I purchased this collar base on my Vet's recomendation. I have raised several puppies and feel this collar has made an incredible difference. Emme, my great dane puppy started wearing the collar at 9 weeks old. The first 2 days she tried to nurse from my adult boxers but slept in her kennel all night, up to 9 hours. She learned to sit and walk on a leash the first week she was in the collar and was house trained by 11 weeks. Although cautious, she accepts new situations very quickly and is very accepting of strangers, children and other dogs. I plan to have her wear a second collar for the next 30 days.I highly recommend the collar. It can be purchased for a very low proice and provides priceless peace of mind."
1,D.A.P. DOG APPEASING COLLOAR FOR SMALL DOGS,VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. UNABLE TO PROPERLY HOOK ON. WOULD NOT GO THROUGH HINGE AND THE COLLAR CAME OFF AND WAS LOST. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY.
1,D.A.P. products,"I ordered all of these products, the diffuser, the collars, and the spray. They made no difference in my dogs anxiety, they do not calm as advertised. I was very disappointed in this product. line."
3,QUESTION FOR SOMEONE WHO HAS USED THIS,"I have used the plug in when I first got my puppy and she was a little too hyper for our older dog and it worked wonders. However now I have moved and am really struggling to get her used to the cat here. I am thinking the collar could work better for her now being as it wll always be on her, but it states no where if it has full regular use as a collar, meaning hookups for her leash and tags, or if she still needs to use her other collar for that. Can someone who has used this please let me know? I just can't tell in the images. [...] Thanks!"
1,Did not work for my dog,This product absolutely did not work for my dog's nervous habit of licking the carpet. Prozac didn't work so I thought I would try this as it was highly recommended. No luck! :(
2,Not what I was hoping for...,"Sorry, it just didn't work :( My jack russell has separation anxiety and really hates it if he thinks we are leaving. I was hoping that this little collar would chill him out a little bit but after a month, no change."
2,DAP did not work for my dog,Used the DAP for a month with no change in level of dogs anxiety.Would sugest for others to try because it is worth it to find something that may work for your dog.
4,Contains great footage of Greg Hooven!!,"This film has great footage of legendary fiddle-player, Greg Hooven and his friend, banjoist Kirk Sutphin. Greg's playing, singing and even talking are just so cool, that I went out and got a fiddle so I could learn how to play ""Sweet Little Julie"" in cross-tuning on the strength of it.-Mike's interview with Greg is very informative and enjoyable as well. If you like Greg Hooven, get this video! You won't regret it."
4,"GREAT, BUT IT'S NOT HEGGAN'S BEST!","""Trust No One"" brought out another side of writing in Christiane Heggan. This novel dealt with terrorism. A old man in a hospital is killed. A powerful policitican is murdered. An innocent woman was killed in a bombing eight years ago. You're thinking, how do all these events die together? Well, they do, in a very interesting way. Julia Bradshaw, the policitians widow, and Steve Reyes, a news reporter, who lost his girlfriend in the bombing, must come together and solve this puzzling mystery! ""Trust No One"" is well worth the money!"
4,A great lite read for the Holi-daze,"I would tend to think of this like historical fiction, but more accurately biographical fiction with a great story based around actual events. But it could still be considered of some historical fiction value as Dicken's work was so influential, particularly through the classic this story is about. This book make a very good holidaze season read as it is fairly short and easy to follow. It imitates in some ways the kind of writing reminiscent in the classic Christmas Carol, so one gets the feel of Dicken's thinking and surroundings at the time he crafted the classic tale. I enjoy reading this after the classic every Christmas season."
1,A shoddy and joyless affair,"I love most things Christmas, and especially Dickens' A Christmas Carol, so I was looking forward to reading this. The idea for the book is sound--the ""secret"" story behind how Dickens was inspired to write his novella and how it became a huge success. But despite a clever twist or two, I cannot recommened this book: it is badly written, poorly plotted, and has lackluster characterizations (especially Dickens). Except for one nicely described scene from atop a cathedral overlooking London, there is no joy to be had in the writing--the ending, which should be practically authorproof in conjuing up Christmas cheer, is rushed and empty. The absence of a historical afterword, explaining how much of this was real and how much was fancy, is inexcusable. I really wanted to like this book, but I didn't. It reads like an outline for an especially mediocre Lifetime TV movie."
5,Awesome Album !!!,"Magic Affair is an amazing band from the early 90's Euro-Dance scene. Played more in the underground... this Album gives a gloomy Trance feeling that is almost impossible to find in any mainstream group today. Omen: Story Continues is great from start to finish!!! a must have for anyone who has Dance Music Nostalgia or love for the underground scenes.Other groups to check out are : The Covenant, Razed in Black, Stabbing Westward, Celldweller, La Bouche, The Real McCoy, The Crystal Method, ATC, Squeezer, Dj Bobo, Captain Hollywood Project, The Birthday Massacrae, Scatman John, Terminal Choice, and Deadsy."
2,Bleeds and naps terribly; double washings required!,"These towels, although wonderfully large in size as promised, are nonetheless TERRIBLE! They required two separate washings just to remove the excessive dye as well as control the pieces of towel nap that flicked off and onto your body and floor before initial use.Now my large towels are more threadbare since the repeated washings but at least are releasing as much lint, making them somewhat useable. But the thickness is gone.I'll never but this brand of towels again. I regret buying them for not only myself, but as a gift for my sister."
3,not really PINK...,"the towels are nice, they take way too long to dry, but the COLOR is NOT PINK, it is more PEACH. I am not happy to own 8 PEACH towels instead of 8 PINK towels. Next time I shop with Marth Stewart at KMart."
1,Totally Dissatisfied,"20/7/05 I purchased a number of towels. I bought these towels for use at home and gifts for family. To my complete surprise and utter disappointment by my family on the very poor quality of the towels. I am extremely embarrassed. Yesterday I decided to use one of the towels the towel did a poor job of drying my skin and added to that the material was coming off all over my skin, I had to shower again and use a different towel. I have been a loyal customer of Amazon and have recommended your store to many friends and relatives. I am requesting a refund for those poor quality towels. I am also recommending that you cease selling those towels as to do so will harm you good image.I would prefer to give a minus rating"
3,Faded after third wash.,"These are very nice towels and are still in excellent condition; however, on the third wash they faded in color very dramatically. I washed them all three times on bright color setting. I cannot explain the difference, but it is substantially duller."
1,This WestPoint Towel is in bad quality!,"The towel looks nice and feels thick, but it is NOT thirsty at all! After doubting there material, I found the towel has been pilling after washes. 100% cotton won't pill unless the material is cotton/polyster blend! I called Martex customer service and tell them my thought. They said they need the towel to investigate. They will send me the replacement only if I pay the shipping and send the towel back. I did, and they didn't until I called them several times. The replacement towel still pills.... hopeless! See the picture and judge it yourself!"
5,"Trojan-Enz Latex Condoms, Spermicidal Lubricant, 36-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)",Great value pack. Has the name value of the name Trojan brings and the value that is unbeatable.
5,top quality product,This has been a great product that I purchased. I received them very fast after I ordered.
1,minimally useful,"I bought the book in preparation for a brief trip to France. The maps are not good enough to use. The phrase book and dictionary are fine. The ""Traveler's Aids"" section is vague and no better than a magazine article. It needs useful maps and transportation information."
3,The Vanished,"So there is this kid named Nick, and he wakes up to find out that his is the only one alive. But soon he finds another group of kids, and together they try to figure out what has made every one in the world disapear. Then at the end there is an unpredictable twist that will suprise you. I thought this book was so so. Just because the begining was kind of lame, but as the book progressed it got more exciting."
3,If you like science fiction books then you should read this,"So there is this kid named Nick, and he wakes up to find that every one has vanished. Finally he finds only 3 survivours, and together they try to figure out how every one in the world has diapeared. To me this book was so so. Just because the begining was kind of lame, but hey, you might think differently"
5,"easy, informative read",Title says it... there's much information put together in an easily read book. Went cover to cover in less than a week. The author touches on the politics behind policy in the food industry and I may read her other offerings based on the good experience with this.
3,"quality information, poor book binding","The information in the What To Eat book is very helpful. I really like the content. However I am very sad that the book started falling apart after reading about 50 pages. The pages of the whole first part of the book have fallen out, and I can see where others are coming away from the glue binding. How disappointing - this was the kind of book I would want to reference often, and instead will be throwing away...along with my money."
3,Informative,This book is interesting and informative. At times it is a little dry and I wish the information would be presented in a more practical way so it is not immediately forgotten..
5,Needed handy next to the cookbooks for continues reference and guidance.,Excellent book. Perfect to keep as a reference for all the hot issues about food and nutrition. Well recommended
2,What to Eat--a difficult book to read,"The subject of this book is important and I really want to read it. But, plowing though the verbose prose is really tough. I find the whole thing repetitive, disorganized, and, in the end, not worth my time. I ended up reading the first half (over weeks, because it is just not pleasurable to read) and skimming the last half."
2,Culture of Food Fear Anyone?,"Please! This is the perfect present for neurotic people who crave more mass media fear mongering. Instead of reading this book (or writing it) ""eat less, exercise more, and eat more fruits and vegetables."" (There! Send me the thirty bucks.)Nestle's antagonists here are political bureaucrats and corporate minions. North Point Press and Nestle are also corporations. I guess it's better reading than romance novels.Don't waste your money; go buy more fruits and vegetables."
2,Disappointing...,"At 624 pages, What to Eat certainly looks appealing and authoritative. However, while Nestle's book does contain some good information, it doesn't live up to it's bold title. I was expecting more of a treatise on healthful foods, mixed with an equal part of what foods to avoid. Instead, Nestle focuses entirely on what to avoid, brushing off, for example, vegetables with a single, scant chapter. Now, I could see the value even in this approach, but the organization of the book (a meandering collection of chapters that do not flow coherently) and Nestle's odd tone of not giving a very clear opinion of what to avoid or not to avoid, mars the book's practical value significantly. A better book that fulfills her objective more thoroughly is Andrew Weil's Eating Better for Optimum Health, which covers almost entirely the same topics, while being thoughtfully organized and much more informative."
3,Shop Around,Shop around before buying this item. Found the same item at both Manards and Sams Club for less than 100 bucks. Disappointed Amazon could not be more competative. You can order from Sams on line and have it shipped to your nearest store.
4,"Sturdy closet, good buy","You're definitely getting a sturdy product if you purchase this closet. The instructions are straightforward and don't require too much guesswork. I was pleased with the finished look of the metallic shelves and rods instead of the white plastic coated ones offered by some other brands. One caveat is the number of screws provided. Depending on the wall your installing this closet into, there may be a need for extra support. We installed this in a wall that was part structure of the house, part drywall cover up to a pre-existing door. There was a need for support on that side, so we had to use more screws. Overall, worth the 4 hours spent in putting it up."
4,Great Product -- Cheaper Price Elsewhere,"I purchased this produce after the ClosetMaid system the builder installed in my closet fell on the floor 3 times.Talk about a hassel-- to have all your clothes, shoes, handbags, etc laid waste on the floor amoung the broken metal and ripped up drywall. I finally decided to purchase this (more substantial) product and have the builder install it.Great Item, but about 2 weeks later I began to see TV adds for a local Big Box Store (Menards) selling the exact same Rubber Maid Closet Kit 3H89 for $79.95 about $40 cheaper than the Amazon Price.My advice is to shop around."
5,Intuitive System,I actually purchased the 6-10' version of this from Lowe's. I've bought two now to redo two of our closets. These systems are great. There is no need to cut the racks if there is a fear of them laping over because Rubbermaid has created this system as user friendly as possible. The shelving can be over lapped as needed to fit the space you have and they actaully lock into place. The system comes with most of the basics you will need for a productive closet system. I really like it. I have found after installing both systems in our closets I actually have a lot more space then I thought.
3,Rubbermaid Closet Organizer Kit,"Pros: looks great, adds a lot of useful space to a closet, good value for the moneyCons: not so straightforward to install, time consumingBased on the product description and other reviews, I thought this would be a great solution for my closet. It was not so easy to install, though, the main problem being the drywall anchors were too shallow for my 3/4"" drywall (my house is about 30 years old--drywall used to be 3/4"" and is now thinner). I had to purchase toggle bolts and washers to get the system to work. Also, instructions were a bit confusing, I ended up needing extra screws because I didn't realize they only recommend screwing in the bottom hole of the vertical standards. Also, I found it better to install on the studs (16"" intervals) rather than the 22"" intervals they recommended so I needed fewer anchors and would have more support."
1,no support,"Be aware that if anything breaks, or you need a new part, you will be out of luck. They don't support their products. Their only response will be to buy a new set."
2,took forever!,was waiting for this item forever. yes it was a great deal but be willing to wait um about 6 weeks.
2,It came damaged,"I would love to tell you this is great closet storage. The large shelf arrived bent right in the middle. The box had been retaped closed and was not in good shape. So now I have to get all these parts back into the car and take them to be mailed,at their expense. Wouldn't it be easier to give me $20 to buy a new shelf.I buy on line for the convenience. Hummm!"
2,No rails available,"This closet system works okay. However, the rails (horizontal part that screws into the wall) are not available separate from the kits. I had extra parts from the the kits I bought so I thought to use them in my garage (yeah I know but these were extra) but I needed the rails to make it work.Contacting RubberMaid I was told that these rails are NOT AVAILABLE separately either direct from RubberMaid nor from a retail store. What a stupid marketing idea."
3,Goft,"Because I purchased this as a gift, I have no idea about how easily it was to assemble, if it was received unblemished, or how stable it is in the closet."
1,"damaged shipment, sending it back","I received the box today from UPS. The box was open, the shelves were bent, and the hang rails and other parts were missing."
4,Lots of Options,"Very flexible system and easy to install once you get the main vertical support in place. Finding a stud in the right location was not easy, but once set-up, it holds a ton of stuff. Organized closet so that I could eliminate two dressers in the masterbed room so that the room looks larger and minimalist. The titanium is not really metal, but more silver colored plastic. Looks nicer than the white and was worth the minor upgrade costs. I would buy a kit with more components than you need because buying piece meal after the initial set-up is too expensive. Better to have a little left over than be short and have to repurchase."
5,"Wonderful product, and perfect for a child's room","It seemed unlikely that, for the low cost, this system would be as sturdy and easy to install as the other reviewers have said. I ordered it fully expecting to be disappointed - what a surprise! I can't say enough about how this product has completely transformed a closet that previously had one wooden hanging rod and one shelf - it had been basically just wasted space. The best thing is that, b/c the shelves move so easily, if you have any ""climbers"" in your house, you can quickly reconfigure your closet so that there are no low shelves to tempt them."
4,"Great product, but not enough anchors and screws","We purchased 2 4-8' Deluxe Custom Closet Kits, which arrived just fine. Installation of the 1st set took about 2 hours (2nd set only 1 hour) and required a trip to the hardware store. Only 16 sets of anchors and screws are included, but the installation requires 20 sets. And, if you want to utilize the extenders, you will need even more. I would have preferred one less shelf and more anchors/screws. For the price, you cannot beat the quality. The units are much more sturdy than I expected. Of course, taking all clothing out of the closet makes you cull the contents and dispose of unneeded items, giving you much more room too!"
5,easy - peasy,"this closet organizer was the answer for me. Not only was it priced right but it was so easy to install. I'm a 52 year old woman who is handy with tools but I would recommend this set up for a beginner. Just read the instructions gather the tools you need and go for it. I planned my configuration and did repairs, painted walls and then installed the organizer. It took only 6 hrs for the install. repairs and paint done the day before. My closet is in an older home with unusual demensions and this solved all my problems. Now my closet looks like a professional closet you see on all the home improvement shows. Love It it's easy - peasy!!!!"
4,8 foot Closet,Sturdy and nice looking. You can change configurations and not pay high end prices. Easy to install if you follow instructions.
3,it's ok,"i was designing a dressing room and ordered this. however, before it came in, my husband went to loew's and bought the necessary things so this was not that useful. it had alot of parts and pieces so was kind of a waste but is a good product if you only want to use this unit."
5,I love my closet!,"My husband put it together, so I can't speak to that...but I do love the system! It's easy to be organized, and I have lots of room. I love it!"
4,"Worked great, easy to install and lots of extra parts...","After purchasing a home, my wife and I gutted all the closets. I bought three of these and redid 4 very large closets and still have lots of spare parts. I disagree with other reviews regarding the wall anchors; I thought they worked just fine. I plan on adding some of the other configuartion components in the future (shoe rack, pants organizer, etc...). Some of the additional components look cheap (pull-out drawers), I'd like to know if Elfa parts are compatible."
2,"The author means well, means well, means well...","but is so busy endlessly repeating the few nuggets of information she has to offer that she never gets to the interesting parts. As a basic primer the book works, but all the worthwhile information could have been rendered in fifteen pages. The most frustrating part is that she doesn't seem all that well read, so instead of being able to show you how different authors make different POVs work, she repeatedly draws her examples from the same handful of books (including Ulysses--as if aspiring writers are going there). The result is a superficial treatment of something that could have been fascinating. Sorry to be so negative, Sherri, but I was excited when I saw the title and my disappointment is acute."
1,Writers beware,"This guide is so repetitive it reads as if she's been commissioned to write the book and is being paid by the word, caring little about boring the reader. The substance barely goes beyond defining the labels for different points of view (over and over). It was useful to know which POVs were used most often for different genres."
3,"Enjoyable, but too long","I have enjoyed many of Victoria Alexander's books and I loved the ""fate"" premise of this book, as well as the very witty dialogue. All the characters were interesting, but the plot seemed to drag on way too long... I found myself a bit bored by the end."
3,Just a 'Light' romance for a quick read...nothing more.,"A very `light' romance, it is the kind of book that you won't remember....Just a quick read and nothing more, there was no great conflict and it was a love at first sight with a happy ending. I would even wager to say that I could classify this book as a Young Adult romance (trust me the sex scenes are safe and not steamy...) I'm glad I borrowed this book from the library, it is not a keeper."
3,Cute,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and though I was not necessarily thrilled with this book, I don't know that I would anticipate her future releases with bated breath. It was cute. Not great, but certainly not the worst I've read. As a matter of fact, I found the first 2/3 of the book rather amusing. But it lost its charm after that, and the heroine went from declaring she would marry the hero to giving up her quest entirely. For no apparent reason. All he did was deny (for the umpteen-millionth time) that he had no desire to be wed. And it suddenly sunk in? The change was too abrupt. Then, again for no apparent reason, she wakes up in the middle of the night determined to have him again. Huh? Now, if she'd doubted herself at all during this time, it might have made her more real to me. As she was written, though, she was too wishy-washy for my taste."
5,2nd book of series,What A Lady Wants by Victoria Alexander is the second book of this series. Four men make a wager to see who be the last man married. The second man to go down is Nigel Cavendish who is ladies man. One night he find himself escaping a lovers bed and hiding in the yard of Lady Felicity. Many laugh out loud moments and sweet love story with strong characters. Also check out the first book of the series 'A Little Bit Wicked' - can't wait for the third book coming out in October 2007.
1,irritating!,"ok,i usually read family saga books,so this was my first romance novel and it might be my last! felicity is so irritating!!! at first her determination to get nigel to marry her was kind of cute,but as you keep reading,she starts to come off as desperate!!! if i have to play games and constantly plan tricks that will trap a man into marrying me,then obviously i don't need him.good thing this story takes place a long time ago when sexually diseases weren't discovered.LOL because that nigel would had definitely gave her something.i just think she deserved better!!"
4,A great book,"This is the second book I've read by this author, and technically I bought it on a whim online. Not sure if it was fate but I really enjoyed this book, the pacing was great and the banter between Nigel and Felicity was sharp and witty and laugh out loud in some spots. Ms. Alexander created two very strong and well drawn characters and that is what really makes this book stand out."
5,What a lady wants - is an adventurous love story,"Bravo to Ms. Alexander. I am used to certain expectations when I read a Victoria Alexander story. I know there will be a spunky heroine and an off-balance hero and united in the pursuit of love.But the adventure was a wonderful sparkle - the scene of Felicity and Nigel alone in the ballroom ... oh, my! I was melting like butter in the microwave.Excellent writing and an adventurous escape from the ordinary life."
3,NOT THE BEST MADONNA MAXI,"This maxi single contains a 4:30 edit of ""Secret,"" as well as the lp version(5:03) and an instrumental(no vocals)version(5:04). There is of course the nonlp track, ""Let Down Your Guard""(4:33), which is a unique R&B influenced track(though not much of a song), but if you are a huge Madonna fan, you might want it."
1,"Single Only,,,","This is just the single with some unknown BSide,,,this is not the single with remixes,,,"
5,Let Down Your Guard,"While there are no remixes of Secret on this cd, it is worth it for the B-Side Let Down Your Guard. Let Down your guard is a sultry r&b song that unfortunately didn't make it on to the album Bedtime Stories. Cd includes Secret Edit, LP version, instrumental, and Let Down Your Guard. The remixes are worth buying as well for Junior's mixes! Check them out!"
4,A sophisticated form of SKA,These guys aren't your average trad ska band. Their approach on SKA is unique and the quality of the musicians in the band certainly compliment their style. Check this one out.
1,Complete Hoax,"This book is a complete hoax. It has absolutely no correlation with reality what so ever, nor is it a surviving Sumerian magical text. If you want to learn about anceint Sumerian culture and religion, I suggest the following books: The Sumerians by Samual Noah Kramer, Sumerian Mythology by Samual Noah Kramer, Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Anceint Mesopotamia by Jeremy Black, and Inanna by Diane Wolkstein. If you are interested in actual Left Hand Path/Dark Side philosophy, I suggest joining the Temple of Set, which has a wide variety of pylons(schools) surrounding Left Hand Path philosophy all of the world and throughout different time periods. A good book to get you started is Uncle Setnacht's Guide to the Left Hand Path by Don Webb. Xeper!"
5,Works but with a rebound,I've tried the Necronomicon spellbook but the rituals always ask for something in exchange for what you've asked. It's a very powerful book and it not to be played with by amateurs. There is a lacking preparatory ritual entiled: The Gates of the Necronomicon. If any one out there knows where I can get this book then please tell me. This will enhance the ritual.Thank a lot.pdbph
1,Not very good and possibly dangerous.,"This is a tiny paperback and most of it is taken up with symbols representing the fifty names of Marduk. It instructs you to get up at 3 am and light two candles. Then stare at one of the symbols and use a spell which invokes the power of this name for whatever purpose the symbol represents. It then goes on to say that if you do hear anything or experience anything strange to just ignore it. Personally, I think this is a terrible practice. Even if you could work a spell with this little but of practice and lack of training, if something manifests itself then this is obviously some type of evocation magic. Evocation can be extremely dangerous if done by someone not trained in banishing techniques. All in all this is not a good book and promotes dangerous practices just to make a quick buck. Don't get it."
2,Curio,"The Necronomicon would make a nice edition to the library of any student of magic and the occult. However, the Necronomicon's roots are more in fiction than any other grimoire I've perused, and as a reference work or textbook it is almost useless."
2,"interesting, even if it is a farce.","I found the book to be well-written and informative, even if it is written on a fictional grimoire. The Necronomicon is a mockery of Magick at it's best and a worthless heap of partiallly digested tree fiber at worst. I would not recommend the Necronomicon for a student of magick or any books based on it. The Necronomicon is NOT the Sumerian religion. Although the writer of this (H.P. Lovecraft) was a deviously clever, superiorly ingenious and quite possibly the best horror/fantasy/sci-fi writer of the 19th and 20th centuries he was no Magickian and his knowledge of such magickal systems were extremely limited. This about invalidates the possibility of the necronomicon ever becoming a ""True and Faithful Revelation of what passed between Abdul Alhazred and...Some Spirits"" (Enochian Magickians will know what I am talking about <G> )"
3,Not enough,"This book needs to be longer. No one can explain such magic with this little of a book.... nuf said, bigger book, more info."
2,Sumerian Magick Illustrated,"""Necronomicon Spellbook"" is very terse, and does _not_ provide sufficient background to understand Sumerian magick. Author Ed Simon's ""Necronomicon"" (ASIN 0380751925) is a better reference for those wishing to understand Sumerian magick.IMO the chief use of the ""Necronomicon Spellbook"" is providing glyph illustrations for tattoo artists."
3,"Fiction, not Myth","The Necronomicron comes from a popular german play from the renassance era. It was a book of unspeakable evil, but it was made up for that play, not barrowed from myth and legend. However the book that was published years later and is here displayed is a fraud, based on sumarian (or so I've heard) deitys. If you do decide to buy this book and you intend to learn from it how to work magic, don't expect results. If you want to actualy learn magic I suggest starting with one of the books by Konstantinos, or another good starting point would be Modern Magick by Donald Michael Kraig. This way with a little time and dedication you'd get actual supernatural results. But if your looking for a goth party guide than I suppose that the necronomicron is exactly what you want, a book of fictitous obscure demonic spells that actualy (due to it's popularity) could work, have fun!"
1,GET RID OF IT FAST!,"If you own this particular copy or any of the Necronomicon books;trash, burn or destroy them! As I delved deeper into the occult it destroyed my life. I am not imaging any of this. You will lose one way or another. It is not a joke. You are opening a portal to something very powerful yet sinister. Look what happened to Jack Parsons among others. It can happen to you."
3,Arabic Variant to Yahweh,"I'd recommend that you impart this book and the Necronomicon to the readers buying the Bible more than LAveys works. Just becasue this includes 'considered witch craft"" does not necessarily make it a non parallel to Christianity. The Lie of the Serpent being scape-'goated' as Lord Tiamat is rather evident. Marduk's fifty names and Angels.. very evident.. many faces of God. A book for the religious comparison reader. The actual Necronomicon names itself an amulet, I'd at least read that first. Most people regarded with this book will not have a faint clue and stereotype you as Vodon or something. If your into the story then check it out."
3,Who cares if it's fake...,"It seems a lot of people think that just because something is fake, it is of no use. This is just not true, if you want to use it, use it! Sure, it might not be as powerful or effective as summoning ancient Gods which have been invoked for millenia, but if you like the idea of the fictional creatures listed in the Necronomicon, use them anyway.."
4,Great book for a H.P. Fan!,"Let me preface this:MAGIC IS NOT REAL I AM NOT A WEIRDO WHO WILL TELL YOU TO BUY THIS FOR MAGICYou cannot change your reality with magic, you cannot break the laws of physics and the laws of quantum mechanics only apply to subatomic particles.Now owning this book out of a morbid curiosity, or because you are a fan of H.P. Lovecraft then go ahead and buy it.Great conversation peice or, if you are a freshman in college, to scare your Cristian parents.Now if you find yourself suddenly floating in cash and naked women than that can be explained by perfectly rational physics...I mean sure the nightmares will stop eventually right?I mean Dr. _______ told me everything would be fine...Though he is at Arkham now...We will all be fine!Dont worry!ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.... He dreams, he dreams, he dreams... he wa"
4,IT is not to be dealt with if you do not know the facts,"This book can entice you into the world of the unknown, but you can and must remember that these materials are in good and evil hands and you and only you are in your path of a wise decision before you have this intoxicating novel in your hands"
3,Beware !,"This book is a very real, and it uses are many as well as extensive. It has been stated many times before you react and take on a challenge know what its eats or it will eat you. Yes I have used this book and will never again. Its powerful and it is fast acting. It has been my experience that you will see almost immediate turn around with the use of the seals. USe it only unce per night or during a full moon. The spirits summoned are extreamly potent and draw to themselves further nasties if it is used repetativly during one session. DONT DO IT! A new addition should be in the works that include FULL understanding of the language before the seals are invoked. Dont be greedy in the use of these seals, they will hunt you !!!!"
2,Not what i expected.,Only briefly describes the images presented. I was hoping for more information than what was depicted. Some what informative but still highly disappointed with my purchase.
1,People Please!,"It was extremely sad to read the previous reviews. Here we have a bunch of ""adults"" saying that this book is pure evil and that they have not dared to try the dreaded spells contained in this black book. It's obvious that these persons have not read Lovecraft and his biography, otherwise they would know that the Necronomicon is a FICTION work and the spells are nothing but random (sometimes incoherent) words. All sorts of magick require time and knowledge and if you do not know where to begin, you shold try ""The Secret Teachings of All Ages"" , now that's a good book about the hermetic and the occult. Don't waste your money buying the Fakeonomicon."
3,Not really what I expected,"This book mainly deals with the lighter side of the Necronomicon. Although the original is fiction, it is still a good read but I found this book to be small and not really that interesting to read. It is just filled with sigils and a short descript of each."
2,The Horror! The Horror!,"An amusing hoax. Personally I detect the dead hand of Robert Anton Wilson or one of his cronies in its production. If you took it 'seriously' and used it as a system of magickal evocation, you could probably attratct a few elemental energies, masquerading qlippoth or whip up a tulpoid type entity, but why bother.As for the ancient gods & demons of Sumer, they were a bad tempered bunch of creeps- leave em in the dust"
1,"Yes, it does work...","I have been a student of the occult for a half century, and I assure this little book WORKS....that's why I burned my copy.I did a spell from it, and the events that transpired that night scared the hell out of me, and I quit my study of spell casting then and there, and have never gone back.Want to ""make something happen""? then buy this book.As for liking what you summon forth, that is another matter."
3,3:00 A.M.!,"When I bought this book I thought to myself, ""Wow! now I can get all the girls at school to like me, I can be a millionair, anything! "" But then I read the instructions(which are fairly simple to understand) I freaked out! It says to get up at 3 in the morning(because natural and spiritual distractions are at there lowest intensity), light two tall white candles, say a memorized two-page prayer to the sky,stare at a symbol,concentrate hard, and go back to bed. Personaly,I think it's kinda hoaky. It's a good book if your into the whole goat blood drinking pentagram thing. But if you just want to buy it for the fun,don't(it still looks good on a bookshelf!)."
4,The Carrots are not the SAME,"Wow. Yes. Yes it is good, but the mahjucks contain inaccuracies with the carrots -- and we all know what THAT means."
2,SpongeBobo fleece blanket throw,"this is adorable to look at but probably won't last long. none of these throws are ever finished off very well around them and will come apart easily. I got it for a grandson's bedroom so maybe it won't need much laundering. If not, then it should last him until he is over Sponge bob and into his next character... LOL"
3,Nic printing a little thin.,"Although the colors are vivid and the size is appropriate for a little kid, the fleece is a little thin."
3,Nexxus Hair Spray,"I thought I was ordering the Nexxus Ultra Fine Mist Hair Spray. This product is okay. I love the Nexxus' Hair Spray. It holds very well, plus it has a nice odor."
2,Faith Hill The Hits,"Being a Faith Hill fan, I was somewhat disappointed with the overall product. I didn't think it necessary to include a video portion along with the audio. The audio was fine, even thought it wasn't inclusive of all her songs, but the video portion quality was not good and of no use to me."
3,NOT ALL HER HITS,I bought this as a gift but was disappointed because some of her biggest hits are not on it.
1,"Jeff's review of Faith Hill's ""The Hits""","The second disk of this 2-disc set was received twice and was returned as defective twice. The first disk played fine & I loved the music.""The Hits"""
3,Don't Fight the Flavor,"I had the same reaction at first, but Flav won me over. U gotta feel him -- he's putting everything he has into it, unlike the average artist who serves up the same prepackaged poses. For that reason alone I think the jointz he's singin on are the realest stuff on the album. plus, he ""bringz tha noise"" on a few cuts for the PE fans. Flav a joke? don't believe tha hype, boyyeee..."
1,Worst Music I've Ever Purchased,"This is the Worst Music I've Ever Purchased and I love music, especially hip hop. Flav was great back in the day as crowd exciter with PE. However, this album just tries way to hard to be awesome and it just isn't."
4,Fantastic,"This is a very good CD. ""Teacher's Pet"" is my favorite song on the CD.The following is a reply to CowPunk's question:""What I really wanna know is; who did this arrangement of the 1956 Joe Lubin tune ""Teacher's Pet""? (Doris Day recorded it in 1958)It's driving me wacky... I know it had to be one of my old '80's power pop faves now making a living in Toon Town cuz their kids are watching the same shows as mine. Which is cool- just who is it? I do love that Power Pop sound.CowPunk""No, that's Christy Carlson Romano. She played Ren Stevens in ""Even Stevens"" and voices Kim in ""Kim Possible""(both Disney Channel series).I agree about the sound."
3,Disney's Teacher's Pet,"Certainly some of the tunes are funny and some homages to Disney classics contained therein. Redeeming social value? Get a life! I believe the soundtrack in this case is worthless without the visuals. Anyway, ""Teacher's Pet"" is much better as a 30 min TV gig.What I really wanna know is; who did this arrangement of the 1956 Joe Lubin tune ""Teacher's Pet""? (Doris Day recorded it in 1958)It's driving me wacky... I know it had to be one of my old '80's power pop faves now making a living in Toon Town cuz their kids are watching the same shows as mine. Which is cool- just who is it? I do love that Power Pop sound.CowPunk"
1,"Wheres ""Paint it black"" on this stupid cd","I just heard this cd and is the most awful peice of sh t ive ever heard.I hate it. And Where's ""Paint It Black""? Very stupid. hahahahaha"
5,Great for Illustrator and Photoshop Users,"For as long as I have used both Illustrator and Photoshop, I've never been 100% confident that I'm using the right program, or if I'm taking full advantage of both apps. I bought this book based on how much I liked Photoshop Trade Secrets - also co-authored by Dave Cross - and having attending a seminar taught by Dave Cross. This book really helped me understand the key similarities and differences between PS and Ill, and how to take full advantage. I really liked they way that theory is combined with practical projects to put the theories into play. I definitely suggest this book for people who use both programs."
2,KOGNYC,"This book would have been ALOT better if ALL of the example files were included in their download site. Many of the examples claim to be from Photoshop and Illustrator Sample Files (Stock Photography). But they are not in mine, and I checked the original installation discs and they aren't on them either. It seems rather cheap to have not included a disc with the book."
3,Slipping tension,I like these suspenders however I had to make some adjustments because the sliding locking clips which one uses to adjust the tension are not functional. They simply do not lock and stay locked. First I tried sharpening the teeth with a flat file which did create some improvement but I still found myself constantly adjusting tension after I had bent over or sat down. I then tried self adhesive velcro tabs installed between the straps as close as I could get to the bottom of the straps where they turn and rise to the said sliding clip. This has worked well however it pretty much eliminates further adjustment with the sliders which is OK with me. So the suspenders are now functional and do the job I need. It would be nice if they came with sliding clips that would remain secure. Definitely like side attachment on these suspenders because of the placement and the good grip on the waistband of my jeans.
5,Great,Belt was cutting me in half. These suspenders don't bother me like regular ones do. Wear them under my shirt and they are holding up great.
1,Fredericks review,I have a sugestion..The leather patch at the back did not fit right on my back! I metal movable hold bar would be much better. Otherwise I found the product good!!
4,An intellectual biography of an intellectual,"The biographer has done excellent exhaustive research which has pieced together much of what has been missed previously. I would caution a casual reader with limited exposure to Huxley that it may be wise to not only familiarize yourself with a majority of Aldous' works but also his contemporaries; you will also want a very good command of the English language with a bit of French, Latin and a handful of others thrown is for flavor. Further to this I, personally, thought that there was maybe a little too much of the author in the book where there could have been a little more of his subject. All in all a good read; though a bit presumptuous and lacking in perfect fluidity very illuminating and well worth the effort."
3,Huxley Bio,"The book seems to be very well-written and interesting. Unfortunately, it arrived rather badly damaged due no doubt to inadequate protection during packing and extremely rough handling in the post. I therefore decided to send the book back and ask for a refund. The bookseller agreed to a full refund but said there was no need to return the book. As a result, I have a free but rather battered book.I thought the bookseller behaved admirably on this issue and emailed him to tell him so. The main point here, though, is that books should always be really well protected before being despatched.Robert Bullock."
5,Wonderfully funny!,"Humphrey and Arthur are abducted by a couple of really shifty-looking scientists to become part of the Wortlethorp Space Program (set up in a local cow field). Fortunately Sampson is prepared to come to their rescue, and accidentally saves the day.As usual the best part of the humour is in the wicked pictures.I you have trouble getting any of the Church Mice series, they are generally available through Amazon.uk (including the new books ""Humphrey hits the Jackpot,"" and ""the Church Mice take a break"" - published Sept. 2000)."
5,Not just for children!,"These books are the funniest and most charming of childrens' literature. The story is told briefly, but it's the pictures that really let you in on the mices' adventures. Careful attenton to the illustrations gives depth and nuance, and a far bigger story. Enjoy!--with or without children."
4,daughters memory,This was a song from my daughter's childhood. I got it to prove that I remembered it. We both had a big smile.
3,Crystals fall out as time passes,"I've had mine for about 3 yrs now and after some hard wear and tear I noticed that some of my crystals started falling out. I guess for the hard treatment I put on mine it has held up pretty decent. The crystals should stay in place regardless, but needless to say if this happens to you what do you do? Buy another one or what? Ecko should have to where you can order more silver dog face tags to replace just in case this happens to customers. The watch itself works fine and everything else is still in tip top shape. I don't know if the jewelry cleaner loosened the crystals or what. Just watchout for the crystals falling out on the front dog tag as time passes."
1,Abhorable,Its disgusting that any company would make this figure into a toy. Complete with knives? geez give the kid a manuel next time.
3,"up down suit (""original version""!!!!)","this single has the ""up side down"" remix or dub, what ever it is. but if you're looking for the original version, you can find it at the ""just say roe"" album, the original title of the song is ""good bye to innocence"", you can purchase this rare cd here at amazon, but if you don't believe me you can listen to the samples!it is awsome!, hurry if you are a huge fan , you got to have it!..."
2,Good for people with little short term memory,"It seems Anastasia has almost thrown a bunch of articles together and called it a book. He is constantly restating stories that he told in earlier chapters. The book does not flow at all. It was almost like he needed to fill a certain amount of pages. The chapters are fun to read standing alone, but sit down and read this book and you will be bored. If you are an Eagles fan, buy it because the game by game descriptions are excellent. If you're not an Eagles fan, forget it."
4,Quintessence - self-titled (Repertoire) 4 1/2 stars,"Originally released in 1970 as this was the band's 2nd record. Nearly as mind-blowing as their 'In Blissful Company' effort {see my review}. Tunes that make this a keeper are the incredible ""Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Gauranga"", the refreshing ""High On Mount Kailash"" (good guitar), the tripping ""Burning Bush"", the instrumental ""Twilight Zones"" and the six-minute live performance of ""St. Pancras"" - plus an added bonus cut, a live version of the previously mentioned ""Jesus, Buddha, Moses, Gauraga"". If you're an old fan of this raga-trip ensemble, you're going to love this CD reissue. Certainly defines 'head music', 1970 style."
1,infantile spirituality,"The thing the prior review does not make clear is that this pretends to be a religious album. It is dedicated to Jesus. I guess one might say it is ""quintessentially"" from the 60's flower power movement in that it combines acid rock jams with mangled and ersatz religious references. ""Upon the sea of immortality, keep your raft afloat with harmony, celestial wise men ring you with divinity. . . Hare ! Hare !"" The music would be far better without the lyrics. And the album would rock if a tab of acid were included, but alas without it, it sounds shallow and childish."
4,Good Game,"Overall the game is pretty fun, but make sure to get Empire Earth two the original, you cant just use the expansion like in age of empires games"
1,Save your money,"Please save your money folks, buy the original Empire Earth along with the AoC expansion!"
1,Do Not Buy,"I have one thing to share. Upon taking the three toys out of the package, each one broke. They are so brittle, that simply handling them ripped their bases off of their bodies. Shortly thereafter, i placed them in a bag so as not to lose any of the broken pieces, and the two capes and an arm broke right off! Save your money!"
2,Episodic; a few interesting things.,"Despite the title, this book, published in 1962, is not a history of the Russian Civil War. Rather, it is an account of six important episodes during the Civil War. It has little interest for readers today, except for the section on Makhno's uprising, army and government in the Eastern Ukraine, which Footman describes in some detail, even including photographs. Footman's discussion is the only one I've seen that makes it understandable how Makhno could start from nothing, raise an 80,000-man army, fend off the various Ukrainian armies, Denikin's White Russian Army, and the Red Army for years. An illuminating historical episode involving a brilliant and ruthless guerrilla leader.As for the rest of the book, read something better."
5,Great NT Book!,"I just took the MCSE NT Server test after reading this book and passed it with a 891. I consider this book a great real world source for information. As for the test, you will need at least one more source, because the book was written for a production environment, not for the test. Get this book if it's the only one you can get!"
5,WORTH EVERY PENNY,This is the best book on NT 4. Not just for the Server exam. I wonder why 90% of all publishers still bother with with books that are just plain ridden with mistakes and flaws (Sybex TIP/IP for example) I wish every book was this great. Peter Barbera
3,Not for MCSE,"I have passed 4 of the MCSE core exams and studied several books including this. This is a good book to understand NT server or NT as a whole but as a preparation guide for MCSE it is a waste of time. You cannot pass a single MCSE exam with this book alone, because its not written for this purpose. Use this book if you need to understand from the very basic in simple way."
5,One of the best NT refernece,"The author makes use of simple examples to explain complicated technical terms, even people with little networking knowledge will understand the concepts. Yet, the material covered in the book is also useful for networking professional"
5,NT Bible !!!,I use this book as a referrence and the ultimate answer guide for questions I have on NT. I also used this book to pass the exam on NT Server 4.
5,Excellent!,"Best overview of NT Server I've come across. The author explains concepts and detail in an easy-to-understand manner, and also throws in bits of gossip about *why* particular things in NT are the way they are. I bought it as a companion to the Sybex MCSE Server and Workstation study guides, and I think it complements them by outlining general principles in greater detail. It is an excellent one-volume reference book.My only reservations are minor: the author's sense of humour occasionally gets distracting, although most of the time it helps the flow of things, and the book is showing signs of age in its structure, with some newer topics inserted slightly out of context. I believe the book deserves a ground-up rewrite in the next couple of editions."
2,Good read only if you are new to NT & networking,This book is a very good read if you are new to the NT environment and if you require a basic understanding of the topic. But it is certainly not a book written for your average techie. Do not get me wrong this is a very well written book but I would certainly include few more sections in there and cut out some of the basic stuff. There are also sections from NT 3.51 like the DNS section which don't do the author's efforts justice.
4,Good study and knowledge source. Lousy CD.,"I bought this largely on Amazon recommendations as part of my preparation for the MCSE exam series. It's a good read, but difficult to use as a reference to figure out why on earth the answer to a sample exam question was (a), not (b). I hoped the CD would overcome some of the failures of the index, but it's so cumbersome to use that it's almost useless. If they would provide an index-only function which you could store on your hard drive, and use the book for text, it would be a truly useful resource. I also get the feeling that Mark got paid by the word, or perhaps by the pound, but all in all I would recommend it."
4,"Great Book, but the CD ...","I really like this book, it's five stars all the way, but I had to knock a star off because the CD annoyed me. The CD has the entire book on it in PDF format and I thought -- great, I can leave the book at home for heavy reading and take the CD to work and look things up as needed. So one day I had something I needed to do and I figured I would just print off the 3 or 4 pages with the information I needed but -- the print icon in Adobe Reader was grayed out. So was the print command under the file menu. Oh, that's great. Thanks, Mark. Do you really think somebody is going to print all 1500 pages of this book and sell it at a discount? Quit being so paranoid. That said, it's still an excellent book :)"
5,Makes complex topics easy to understand,"No tower of babel here. The authors look at a complicated operating system and explain it in plain terms. Tells you what you can do, why you might want to do it and how to get it done. The only thing missing from this 1150pp monster is useless filler material so often found in other similar-sized texts"
1,Out-of-date instruction on DNS,"The book provides out-of-date info on NT 4.0 DNS configuration, making the whole process confusing and does not do justice to the NT 4.0's ncie DNS feature. Contrary to the author claim, NT DNS can be easily configured with the GUI NT DNS adminstrator and it works well with UNIX BIND DNS. In fact, Microsoft's white paper on NT DNS provides correct and concise info on configuring and using NT DNS, and it is free for downloading on Microsoft's web site. I recommend that users of NT DNS read Microsoft's free white paper for DNS configuration. Another point is that the new edition added a lot of pages to the earlier edition, but not much more info (added a lot of personal stories, jokes, etc.). The new edition is a typical example for making a useful book less useful."
1,Wrong!,Why would you publish a book when the details are all wrong? Didn't anyone edit this thing? He should have read the Resource Kits. Pity.
1,windows NT SERVER 4.0,please i want to review about subject for windows NT server 4.0 and give me agood index about this topics
2,Save your money...,"As a current MCSE+I, MCSD, MCT I recommend that anyone seeking Microsoft certification not spend countless time on reading books. Time is better spent on actually using the products.For additional information there are free sources on the internet such as discussion groups and usenet.If you are new to certification the better way may be to take an actual beta exam as they are only $50. Who knows, you may get lucky and actually pass..."
5,Excellent !!!,"This is the best book in the market. It is so great that all of my students, co-workers love it so much and I have learned a great deal from it...until this day.The writing style is down-to-earth, and it is written so that it would be so easy to understand, and to laugh with the author sense of humor. The knowledge of the author is so huge, un-questionable that I don't know if he was part of the NT 4.0 develeper team."
5,The Windows NT Bible....,"This monster pretty much covers everything you would ever want to know about NT. It is about 1600 pages so each topic is given at least 200 pages meaning that thoroughness is not an issue. Excellent for admins, beginners, intermediates, basically anyone that uses NT in any form can use this book...GET IT!"
5,Great build and sturdiness,"These are great bowls in terms of build quality and sturdiness, the silicone rubber bases adhere smoothly and _solidly_ to the bowl's surface - my main worry when looking at a SS bowl with a rubber base was that over time the seal of the rubber would become loose, allowing unsanitary food to build up in the gap between the bowl surface and the rubber. It appears, after some moderately heavy use, that these are very well sealed and are unlikely to separate. My only (slight) complaint is that the bowls are not completely curved, and have a slight flare at the lip. I think this is intended to make them easier to hold, e.g. while whisking (as opposed to very round bowls), but if it matters to you, please take note."
5,Wonderful bowls,This set of mixing bowls are wonderful. Here is a hint to make the lids fit the bowls properly. Fill your sink with some very hot water (not boiling) and put the plastic lids in the water for about 5 minutes. Take them out of the water and immediately (and securely) put them on the bowl and let the lids cool on the bowl. Now the lid is the proper shape for the size of the bowl and a perfect fit.
1,"Yikes, these are awful!","The steel used in these bowls is laughably thin and weak. The bowls can be easily misshapen with your bare hands, and feel light and cheap overall. The lid issue is still valid. I don't like them, and for the price I paid I should be worshiping them for their quality, style, and functionality."
4,Mortgage Power,"As an experienced loan officer,I found this book very helpful on techniques to achieving top producer status. All mortgage professionals will benefit from reading this book and I recommended it to my colleges."
1,Digerati: An intellectual vacuum?,"I happened to check the book out from the library, so I am happy to say I did not waste any money on it. Some books are readable and interesting. Other books may be readable and boring. Unfortunately this book is unreadable, owing to an idiotic typography that acts as a constant visual hiccup, so the issue of interest or boredom is barely relevant. From the few pages I did go through before giving up in disgust -- and with a headache -- I can only say that rarely have I read someone so ignorant of culture, so poor in intellect, and having so much pretensions to a high brow culture. Maybe Brockman thinks that it brushes off on him just by rubbing shoulders with some more or less ""famous"" people. In his case it clearly does not.Bottom line - unreadable, empty, and pretentious."
3,"Brockman's books are great jumping off points, not great destinations","I think that the best way to look at John Brockman and his books about his buddies ( I think that another reviewer here was right on the money when he refered to Brockman and his edge.org cronies as a 'mutual admiration society') I've thought the same things ever since I started reading his works and his website... Don't get me wrong, these are very smart people...just not as singularly brilliant as Brockman seems to think they are...the best thing you could do, if you want to really plumb the depths of thought that these people offer, is to google or search this site for other works by them: ""Digerati"" only gives you the most shallow view of what they are about."
5,The truth about Stack Melting Technology,Very informative and realistic. Have experience with these style melting systems and highly recommend...
3,OK product.,Acceptable product for the price. Could be better engineered to make it easier to change settings (one hand perhaps?)
4,Natural Disasters makes geology interesting!,"As a developer of geology and earth science college textbooks for major publishers, I've worked with a lot of excellent books. Patrick Abbott's Natural Disasters, second edition, is one of the most interesting, readable, informative, and engaging books available. It doesn't have all the four-color diagrams and photos, and doesn't need them. The book tells many fascinating stories that engage students (e.g., the Lisbon earthquake of 1755), relates these natural events to humanity, and offers outstanding short summaries of geologic phenomena and events (e.g., the K-T extinction). This is one of the few books I keep on my desk to illustrate geologic events and principles for friends and coworkers. Highly recommended!"
4,Interesting,"Although I dont overly buy into the whole global warming theory, but this is a good textbook that explores a lot of different natural disasters."
3,I have to wonder,"I bought a 727 about a year ago (i.e., Feb 2008). This was to replace a Humminbird that shows fish as a square dot. I had great results with it. I bought this because of the price and features. It works, BUT I have yet to see a true arch that is indicative of a fish. It shows very fine details but arches,nada. I called the cust svc desk and asked for exact settings that should show the arches, not much help there. After using many different settings I have never seen the arch. I don't know. The demo mode shows a multitude of arches. I don't know if I have a bad unit (costs $18 to return it)or if I am just ignorant(I figured the default should work for most uses) still, it seems fine for everything but the arch. Fish seem to show up as a round dot on mine...I hope you have better luck with the arch feature."
4,"Half Lolita, half Carrie","The pieces are familiar: a high school girl dealing with the ultimate family dysfunction, high school bullies, and high school crushes. The crush-ee, in this case, is a high school guidance counselor achingly aware that Amy Smootster isn't a little girl any more - a fact that Amy is equally aware of, and brings clearly to his attention. But she has real problems at home, such as it is, the kind that a counselor is supposed to involve himself in.But there's something very special about Amy, more than the fact that wet puddles form under her shoes when embarassment becomes its worst (which it does often). And the high school bullies, even the thugs in that dark alley have something even darker behind them ...It's more complex than Emily the Strange, and more for teens than for Emily's `tweens. The artwork is good, sometimes angular, and it does better with expression and narration than literal representation. Maybe not for everyone, but I'm coming back for more.//wiredweird"
5,Madonna I want to go,"Madonna is going to my former hometown in November and I have to see that concert. I never made it to see her ever performing all of those hits. It just didnt work out. I have many favorites of Madonnas songs since I was raised on her music but a few are: Like A Prayer, Lucky Star, Like A Virgin and Papa Dont Preach. Papa Dont Preach hit me pretty hard in Life, I thought my dad was going to be pretty tough on me, little did I know at 18 years old he took his warm loving heart and arms and put them around me and told me he loved me, Youll always be my baby. In 2007 before he passed away on Valentines Day 2/14/07 he told me that I was a good kid and a good mother to my daughters. SO now I just need to get a hold of my daughter so I can go see Madonna and of course get a plane ticket. Madonna woke me up in the world about life. So dont miss the Sticky and Sweet tour . Thanks dad for everything. Im still a material girl at heart."
2,One of Madonna's worst 80's remixes,"man, 80's extended remixes really oftentimes slaughtered the original songs. this remix just seems too hollow, if that makes any sense. I guess it's because they removed some of the original instruments from the album version, like the acoustic guitar solo during the instrumental break. all it is is beats. the reason to get this cd is for the non-album track ""ain't no big deal"""
2,Not good for all waterstones like advertised.,"This product looks good and has a nice big size. I comes in a hard plastic box and works well on stones 1000 grid and above, but it is advertised as a good choice for all waterstones. It does the job somehow on coarse stones like 320 grid but you better have a couple of beers next to you and some time to spare, because it took me over 30 minutes to flatten a stone that was not that bad. DMT is better on this if you use coarse stones."
4,incredibly fast service,product came in brand new condition and arrived within 2 days of confirmation. extremely fast shipping and service.
1,Worthless.,I cannot believe that Norton sells this product.It is a nothing more than a 220 grit waterstone with slurry channels that goes out of flatness so fast that it is completely worthless.This is NOT a reference plane in any sense of the word. If you want a true reference plane to flatten your waterstones get a truly flat piece of mirror glass and use 180 or 220 grit silicon carbide wet/dry sandpaper.
5,"Release 'Em All, Big Guy!","How long have we all been waiting for Family Matters, a very American show loved around the world, to be released on DVD? It's now over 20 years since the first season was broadcast, the DVDs of which I and many others happily made our own last year. I hope Amazon, the show producers and actors don't bury this fine show under a mountain of red tape and time, spoiling it for future generations."
4,Classic,"This was such a wonderful show, and remains one of my favorites. I do wish they would come out with a boxed set of the entire series though, as the show ended over ten years ago. Steve Urkel is still in his annoying neighbor boy phase, it was not until later seasons that he matured as a character and became more of a serious (if mad) scientist than a geeky klutz. It certainly was funny to see him try to woo Laura."
5,Such a tease.....,When I first saw season 1 I bought it without any hesitation. Look all I'm asking for is just the release of the rest of Family Matter's seasons please allow me to complete my collection. Putting out just season is a GIANT cock tease. Warner Bros don't be D bags and not release to the world the wonder that is Family Matters. If crap like Jersey Shore can put out all their seasons I'm pretty sure Family Matters can do the same.....
1,JUNK!,"These expensive bird feeders fell apart in a few short months. The plastic at the bottom cracked, and the metal cage had nothing on which to grasp. JUNK!"
1,Terrible feeder,It is not easy to fill . The plastic that holds the feed is upside down and as you fill the seed falls out. Terrible design. Sorry I purchased itWish I could return it.
2,Broken :o(,"Unfortunately, when I received this feeder, one of the pegs at the base was broken. I returned it not only because of this broken peg, but because it is very, very large and the plastic piece in the middle was scratched up terribly."
4,OK feeder,We had a similar one a few years ago. It's not totally squirrel proof but the squirrels have a hard time getting to the seeds.It's one of the best and affordable feeder available.I would recommend this product.
2,"""Good intentions do not a good book make""","This is not an awful book. It has interesting characters, an intriguing background, an unusual voice and lots of good intentions. But here's a lesson for new writers: all of the above is not enough for a good book.One thing that this book lacked was a focus. A story doesn't need to be linear to be good, but it does require a thread. It needs to bring the reader to a certain point, to gain something that for a lack of a better word I'll call an insight. It doesn't happen here. I struggled with this book for weeks until I was able to finish it. The writing had too much stream of conscious that didn't cover the absence of a plot. I guess that the book can be called half-baked. A good editor might have been helpful in making this into something that gives the reader more than the sense of relief that it's over upon finishing it."
2,waffling,"Honestly I cannot decide if I like this book. The descriptions of her family is engaging and I did enjoy the characters. The thing is when I think back on having read the book, I do not feel like I got anything out having read it. There just is no progression. While reading I kept thinking that the author was using her memories of her past to explain something, but it never comes to pass.The feel of the book is similar to frequently listening to a friend ramble on about her childhood. You just get to the point of saying enough already!"
3,Work but are too thick,"These are your basic condoms. If you want something thick without much feeling, these are for you. They do the job but there are better brands out there in my opinion."
2,This book is now obsolete,"This book was published in 2001 and, having worked in the domain name industry for over 13 years, I can confirm that this sector has lived a lot of evolutions since then, which have made this book obsolete (e.g. the way some registrars handle expired domain name, the existing policies for transferring a domain name to another registrar, domain name with non-Latin characters...).If you intend to register a domain name and don't know how to do, I recommend youRegistering A Domain Name For Beginners, which I have just released. This e-book tells you how to proceed and what you need to pay attention to before, during and after the registration process."
5,DomainFool.com gives two thumbs up!,This is a clear introduction to an evolving and important topic. I have purchased domain name books that are completely out of touch with everything except the history of domain names (yawn!). This book is really useful. Very nice job from your DomainFool!
1,Horrible,"This ""music"" (if you can call it that) makes me sick. Madonna IS singing on these tracks (rather poorly), but she's singing about one or two lines each, with bizarre ""vocals"" and distorted sounds thrown in by some guy named Otto von Wernherr. Don't waste your money on this crap."
2,2 Stars - for the CD itself - not the music,Besides being some of Madonna's worst music - this CD is kind of a neat Madonna collectible because of it's cut-out shape on the CD itself. Other than that - I don't recommend listening to the music itself...that would just be plain dangerous! ; )
1,Not worth it!,"I only gave it one star b/c I couldn't give it zero. I don't know if you could really claim that this is Cd from her. She doesn't actually sing in any of the songs. Someone just mixed some music together, added a couple of ""singing"" phrases from her and just repeated it over and over again to a beat. It's not worth the money, not even for a TRUE Madonna fan!"
5,All the fun is how you manage language...,This what this book is about. The reader finds out how much he can discover while reading a literary or non literary work...
3,No op-amps ?!,"Yes, there are lots of problems and it's explained pretty well, but operational amplifiers are conspicuously absent!Also, the original typesetting leaves something to be desired, but I'd rather have op-amps."
3,Not suitable for recap but great exercise examples for better grade.,I used this for extra exercise examples to sharpen my skills in circuit analysis. I recommended this only if you have other references/ textbooks as guidelines.
4,Book Review,Book arrived quickly. There was a small tear in the paper jacket that I wasn't happy about. Great stories though.
4,"I got stuck with ""Gumshoe""","""G is for Gumshoe"" was my first Kinsey Millhone novel. I will tell you that I went back and read everything leading up to ""G"" before ""H"" came out. I have been an avid Sue Grafton fan since the beginning. She makes Kinsey so fun and fallible. You just have to love her and her stories. I especially love Henry."
4,Good book,It is a good book but you dont want to buy this book without reding the others that preceded it first or you will be lost.
3,How much can you handle?,This book is pretty frucking far out...and I've read a lot of cutting edge stuff. Whose reality are we talkin' about here? The reader must decide for himself.
4,Four Stars,I love Hannah Howell and Lynsay Sands. They are my two favorite romance novelists. The other two authors were not familiar to me though.
4,Why does China need a budget travel guide?,"I have been to China 5 times and on my most recent trip used this book. I've used both Fodor's and Frommer's guide before. I found this book to be the most complete and accurate of the three. This book also covered a lot of the smaller destinations such as interesting cities that the other guides ignore or lend short thrift to (for instance, Kaifeng).However, I'm unclear why China needs a budget travel guide as China must be one of the cheapest places to travel to in the world. So, I was a little disappointed that it didn't list some of the more ""expensive"" restaurants ($8-$15/person for Beijing duck at a real fancy place for example)."
5,A must for avery Jam&Spoon Fan,I followed Jam and Spoon since the early days and they have always been very good. This CD is a must for everyone who likes their Music - especially as it is a homage to the late Mark Spoon.
2,Welcome to the meatgrinder of dice throwing,"This isn't your typical Axis and Allies game. It uses similar component's regarding the board and pieces and the combat system is familiar but diffrent in many ways, but the production phase is skipped altogether and you receive random reinforcements in its place.Historic detail is nice. Most places of importance of the Normandy Campaign are on the map and the military units are named on the reinforcement boards so you get to know what you play with.The problem is with the game itself. There is very little room for tactical play and basically it is a meatgrinder of dice throwing. This maybe fun a couple of times but after that you will not be playing the game that much.I have the feeling that this game was rushed in the 60 year anniversary of D-Day and could have done with a little more playtesting."
5,Great Game very fun,I really enjoyed this game...I didn't think it was heavily favored for the Germans at all. I have only played it once so far but the Americans won (on the last turn) and the gentleman I was playing against was a more experienced gamer than I am.The system is great and obviously anything is possible when you are rolling die. We decided to play without the fate cards for the first time so we would not have to worry about one side getting unlucky somewhere but we will definitely use them in the future.Overall I thought this game was awsome and didn't take forever either.
2,Not a real wargame,"Any Wargame tha depends on the roll of the dice more then your tactics and strategies is not a real wargame. it's fun but, if your looking for strategic reality this isn't it. It's a strict reenactment of the real landing. It provides no room for imporvisation by either side."
4,Visions of Heaven,"Interesting, particularly if you feel that there is very little written or said about Heaven. Written as a kind of history of events from the past."
5,the best!,"I can't believe it, I'm only on the 4th lesson, and I've learned more italian than with any other program. This has inspired me to take actual Italian classes, just to learn to read and write it since speaking it is so easy! I was skeptical at first, so I made a small investment, but now, I'm buying the whole program. If I learned this much in a few lessons, imagine with an entire course!"
1,It is a scam,"After they get your credit card number, Pimsleur will secretly charge your card under a different name. What happen is that when you buy their level one, they will keep sending you so called ""Free"" product, if you don't send the free product back, they will keep charging you $64 every week until you discover your card is actually being charged."
5,Awesome....,"If you like The Who, buy this album no questions asked, they are better than them if you ask me....this band should have been bigger, but they drank and did drugs too much....it took its toll. This album is perfect."
2,Not as in depth as I expected...,"After reading this book, I can only say I learned one thing - Our minds reconstruct our memories, they aren't 100% accurate. Besides that, this book just tells you to question what people tell you, or question what the media reports and compare it to statistics. If you already have good common sense, you may not need to read this book. I find it comparable to a consumer economics class."
1,"Interesting topic, boring book","I were expecting much more from this book. It is very basic and repetitive. Probably the author can make a 20 pages summery without missing any important concept.(later)... I take a breath and finish it, and have to acknowledge the last part of the book is better, so add some 30 more pages to the summery"
1,Pap. Don't Waste Your Time.,"'There's a pharmacy that sells perfumes and advertises them on a marquee with the phrase, ""We have no common scents."" This book epitomizes that idea. If you don't have any, hopefully it'll help. If, on the other hand, you made it through the fourth-grade you probably acquired the level of critical-thinking skills herein described and would do better to return to your game of tiddley-winks. Fortunately, I get most of my books through inter-library loan for $1.00. This one was one of the few that caused me to feel the fee was exorbitant."
4,Handbook for critical thinking,This is a good treatment of how to approach the world with a more critical view of your own thought processes. Kida rightly points out that it is not innate stupidity that makes otherwise well-meaning and intelligent adults believe the most absurd things. We simply aren't taught to think critically and we're by nature and by culture programmed to take mental shortcuts on our way to understanding the world and forming a picture of its meaning. I know some folks who are going to get this for their birthday...
2,An average book...,"This book introduces some elementary psychology terms which are explained but never pinpointed. For instance, chapters are spent on Confirmation Bias (seeking for information to confirm your subjective view and ignoring information which contradicts it), although he never mentions the name of the term. Also, he uses the same references time and time again, two or three favorite experts whose work he refers to nonstop. Many of his anecdotes, although referenced, are extremely generalized and vague.Overall a decent book for those who are new to the idea which the title suggests, but anyone with a couple psychology classes under their belt would be better off skipping this for something with more substance."
3,Entertaining but flawed,"There was a lot of interesting information in this book (see the other customer reviews) but the author doesn't always follow through on his own advice.For example, he acknowledges that just because he couldn't test the hypothesis of God's existence, did not in itself disprove God's existence. But he fails to apply that same reasoning to the belief that the devil can possess people.It's worth reading because many people to tend to believe everything they read. Few are willing to think critically and examine so called evidence. Also, many people (especially fundamentalists) fail to examine their own strongly held beliefs in the light of contradictory evidence. They tend to hold on even more to these beliefs.I found Cordelia Fine's book more useful."
4,A way to re-engage common sense,"I was looking for something to stir my thought process as lately we've been bombarded with a variety of viewpoints from a variety of sources (TV newspapers, blogs, etc etc etc).It was a good reminder, though not groud breaking concepts, on how to analyze information - without jumping to conclusions based on minimal evidence. I've found myself falling into that same trap a few times and being given viewpoints based on someone's personal experience or sound bites from the media world. We're constantly bombarded with snippets of information and ""psuedo"" science T.V. where only one side is presented or the entire background/facts are conveniently ignored.Worth a read to remind oneself of traps we easily fall into when digesting information. I did find it to repeat the same concepts frequently. I was hoping for more information."
5,Excellent Food for Critical Thought,"Tom Kida does a masterful job of making his arguments more rigorous than simplistic restatements of the obvious, while at the same time, avoiding the pitfalls of being overly academic. I intend to make this book required reading for my undergraduate students.I was saddened to see Jim appear so ill and do hope that a regimen of therapeutic touch proves efficacious (page 58)."
4,Not what I was hoping for,"Despite the picture on the package, these are not cartoons from the HBO series. They are good cartoons, but if you have any of the old Lulu cartoons, you probably already have these: Chick and Double Chick; Bargain Counterattack; A Bout With a Trout; Loose in a Caboose; Bored of Education; A Scout with the Gout; Musical Lulu and The Dog Show Off."
3,Favorite Kids Cartoon,I was very excited when I found my favorite kids cartoon on DVD !!! However these cheap dvds don't work on my IMac computer
5,Boots the musician!,"Love this cd! Boots inspired me to play saxophone 50 years ago. This is more jazzy & warm than most of his recordings; ""Round Midnight"" is gorgeous & soulful. Thanks for the great music, Boots. We miss you."
4,"solid, well priced receiver hitch","Bought this for my '97 Tacoma, and Amazon had the best price on what turned out to be a solid, well-made receiver hitch. The only thing I would change is the installation instructions that were good, but abbreviated. Took a minute or two to realize that once you take off the bumper/brackets, you have to remove the brackets from the bumper before re-installing. Very happy with the fit and finish of this hitch."
4,"Great Product, One little snag","The hitch is working great and Installed great with only one little hitch, I had to shave down the tabs that locked into the frame of my truck because the spacing on the tab was not wide enough."
5,'03 Tacoma Tacoma Hitch,"The hitch receiver arrived packaged nicely. The welding and finish was nice. It took two people about 2 hours to take off my bumper and bumper brackets, install the receiver, and reinstall the bumper brackets and bumper. I is very helpful to have a second set of hands to hold one side while you bolt the other. No drilling was required. Comes with all the nuts and bolts you will need."
5,Well made. Easy instal for novice,"This was an easy install for one person to do in less than an hour. I am by no means an auto expert, but this was not difficult at all. You just need a 19mm socket with ratchet wrench if you are just installing the receiver. Excellent look after install. Instructions were straight forward and easy to follow. Unlike some other review, you dont need to remove the spare tire for install - I installed just fine its just one bolt was in a tight place for me to fit the wrench. Excellent, low cost option for my 2002 Toyota tacoma prerunner-I recommend the following items in addition to this: Hopkins 43315 Plug-In Simple Wiring Kit for Toyota Tacoma 1995-2004 and Hopkins 48595 4Wire Flat Mounting Bracket-Even though you dont need the flat mounting bracket, I purchased it and drilled two holes to the stock bumper to make a clean look.I'm very happy with the end result and the final cost compared to a Uhaul's estimated price"
5,Extend a truck works as hoped it would,"I bought the extend a truck for my Toyota Tacoma pickup so that I could carry my canoe without having to put it on my roof. The instructions were fairly clear and there were no problems putting it on. I probably spent an hour total installing it. It works perfectly. Now I can get my canoe to where I want to go by myself if I have to, which is what I was hoping to be able to do. Good product."
3,Don't bother,"If your sole reason in getting this is for the colour mix of ""true Blue"" then I suggest you get the remastered version of the Album by the same name. If you do that you'll get the colour mix of the song as well as other gems. As for this maxi single its not worth the price. Yes ""true Blue"" is great but the other tracks are nothing to write home about. ""Everybody"" never really goes any where and it sounds so dated. ""Papa don't preech"" is a good song but the extended RMX is bland. You are not missing a thing by not having this version. ""Live to Tell"" is a good instrumental track and along with ""True Blue"" was the only reason I gave it three stars. In my opinion this CD single is not worth the asking price; like I said buy the remastered album of True Blue and you'll be much better off."
1,Mix Up Mess,"Unfortunately I did not receive First Check, which is what I ordered. Instead I received Quickscreen at Home Drug Test which was not user friendly. We used it anyway to test our daughter because we could not wait to reorder the correct ones. The results did not come up as the instructions indicated they would. In other words, as far as I am concerned it was completely worthless and I would like my money back. We have been very happy with the First Check tests and I am now waiting to hear back from Amazon to see if we will be reimbursed."
1,Flimsy Product,Long story short... I received the product and it look like a decent product...But after a few weeks of usage... I placed the lid on the table... not hard at all...and the lid broke... really??? it's not like I dropped it... but now i need another one...I suggest getting acrylic i suppose...
5,Very versitle container,I love this container. I have 2 of them and they are just the right size and look great on your counter as a canister!
2,No seal on the lid?,"I was going to buy this jar, until I found it in store at the Container Store, and discovered it doesn't have a seal around the lid. My hopes for the perfect flour jar were destroyed! I love this jar, and Anchor makes great quality glass canisters and bakeware, however without a seal around the lid the jar is useless for storing any kind of food item. Anchor needs to seriously consider offering either various sizes of seals for their jars that don't come with them already, or just start making this line with seals. I contacted them about this, and unfortunately they had no suggestions for me. Very disappointing. Keep this in mind when deciding to purchase this line from Anchor. The Hocking line does not come with seals!! :("
3,Great jar but does not seal well,"I bought this jar to replace a broken one from Ikea that held marshmallows and other treats. The broken one had a lid that had a plastic/rubber seal that kept air from getting in - this jar's lid does not have any seal and just more or less sits loosely on the top of the jar. I'm using it, but I wouldn't buy it again for the purpose I wanted."
4,Just a modest suggestion,"Yes, my parents and grandparents used this type of jar. So did the local druggists. They had a simple fix for the whole ""bad seal chipping lid"" issue, they simply stuck a cork liner on top of the jar, and sat the lid on the cork. I'm sure this product would work fine. http://www.amazon.com/Con-Tact-04F-C6421-06-18-Inch-4-Feet-Adhesive/dp/B000WEPD6U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347024614&sr=8-1&keywords=cork+shelf+liner or just search amazon for cork shelf liner. Stick it on and cut with a razor knife or xacto."
5,"nice design, good price","I've purchased 8 of these jars total, in the 2, 1 and 0.5 gallon sizes.Pros:1. Good, simple glass design.... stable, pretty hard to tip when filled with ingredient...... wide mouth that makes it easy for reaching in and scooping out2. Glass material is so much more satisfying than plastic kitchen containers, which seem to be the norm3. Cheap price, especially compared with other glass jars available from places like Sur la Table4. Sturdy; unlike other reviewer I've never had a problem with these jars breaking in the past 2 years I've owned them. The glass is relatively thick and the lids are in fact sturdy and have survived being dropped a few times...Cons:1. Like another reviewer has noted, some of them come with cosmetic defects like bubbles, or an imbalanced lip2. There's no seal/gasket.... they're useless for storing, for example, brown sugar"
3,Its ok,Wishing for a rubber gasket around the gas lid... which can chip easily. can keep only ittms that dont need to be airtight
3,No....it doesn't have......,a silicone seal. In fact it has no seal of any type. I couldn't figure out why it was so inexpensive until I recieved it. I intended to use it as a canister and assumed it had a seal. It does not. I guess I could use it as a jelly bean holder. If anyone knows where I can pick up a seal please let me know by commenting on this review. The jar is big and I like it. If it had a seal I would LOVE it.
2,Stale Cookies,"My cookies were stale after two days because the lid does not have an air-tight fit. If the fit were air-tight, I would rate the product 5 out of 5."
4,Wish it had one thing,"This item is beautiful on the counter and I absolutely love it, except it has NO GASKET SEAL. Which leaves any product open for moist or bug encroachment. For tea or any other sealed product it would be great. Not good for sugar, flour, or cookies etc."
3,Great product but over priced online!,The item itself was exactly what I wanted to put my puppies treat in. Unfortunately two weeks after having purchased this product I found the exact same item in a local store for 1/3 of the price (regular priced not on sale). I would recommend this item but I would definitely check your local retail stores before purchasing online. (I have purchased two more locally and will purchase a few more.) These are great as cookie jars or for storing your dry goods and they come in a variety of sizes.
3,Apothecary jars,"The jars were for a terrarium planting party, and were smaller than I imagined. My fault. Product was great quality."
1,not a tight lid,"I was initially excited to find these jars ""MADE IN AMERICA"" as I had previously purchased one at Ikea which had not been from a US company. The price was right and I was planning on using them to store flour, sugar, coffee, etc. I assumed, incorrectly, that the lid would be airtight, as was the one from Ikea. Instead of having a rubberized seal, the jar lid rested glass on glass, and would not have kept anything fresh or bugs out of the jars. I now only use the jars for non-foodstuffs, not my original intention. I was disappointed and will not purchase these again.I did, however, find Anchor Hocking glass jars with screw top lids at Target (made in America) and I use them for my original purpose."
3,"Looks nice, but not safe for use in active food preparation","My wife use the 1-gallon jar to store dough in. It worked well until it shattered. And it shattered with only a small bump while she placed it in the sink to wash it. Lucky it was in the sink, because it shattered into many pieces. It is really a safety hazard. I wish the product were a bit more expensive and better made, since the size is perfect. NOT SAFE FOR DAILY USE !In response to a query - here is what we are using now: Snapware 23 Cup MODS Food Container. It is BPA free, large enough to reach into to slice out dough, yet small enough to fit into the refrigerator."
4,Good quality,"We bought this to make our delicious homemade Kombucha. We found it a week later at Target for two thirds the price. It is good quality, attractive, and my scoby is THRIVING. Plus, you can use the glass lid instead of a dish cloth or coffee filter as it protects the scoby but still gives it enough oxygen to live."
3,Huge,"The jar is very nice looking and it looks and feels like its good quality. However, it is HUGE. A lot bigger than I was expecting. It would pretty much hold a 10-lb bag of sugar."
5,Love the Jars,I purchased two jars and was pleased when they arrived. I may order additional jars as I plan to use these jars on the candy bar at our wedding.
3,Would like to keep them but...,I ordered two of these. They arrived promplty and packaged well. One of the jars was in good condition but the other was cracked. Went through process of replacement for the damaged one and the new one arrived quickly. Just opened the package and this one is cracked as well. I'm not going to replace again but instead get a refund since this is annoying. The one I kept looks great but not worth the hastle for another.
5,Not a good container for terrariums,I gave this 5 stars because it is great for its intended use (cookie jar). I bought it because it was one of the first things that came up under a search for terrarium containers. The glass has a lot of small irregularities that keep it from being ideally clear for a terrarium.
4,Excellent container! Highly recommend!!,I purchased this for my Dogs rawhide treats! It is very large and holds many of them in an elegant way...who would have guessed that rawhides can look nice! The only thing I wished was that it had a rubber seal to make it more secure! Other than that you can't find a better priced or better looking piece.
5,excellent purchase,priced well below retail for this product. It has many uses around the house. Would purchase this product again.
3,Not as expected,I searched for a plastic 1 gallon Jar with lid this is what came up in vaious sizes reading throughout the description it NEVER stated it was glass. Also I was able to find this at a lower price att eh local walmart.
4,I should have looked closer!,"The book is great and the trivia interesting but I didn't look close enough. I realized it wasn't recent when the author refered to Hollywood as Disney-MGM, of course the old name. He should update the book if they have another printing and/or do Volume 3. Still fun though!"
2,not worth the hype,"I was really excited about getting this book, but realized why no one else had written about the trivia of Walt Disney World. I feel that the author put a lot of hard work into the book, but the info is not worth reading.. this is said by a disney fanatic who owns over 100 disney related books. This book is not worth spending the money"
4,"joy to read and educational, but flavorless dishes","Author really explains how to do basics with vegetables- good for a vegetable averse person to learn from. She is a good writer.However, the recipes, which I have followed to a tee, result in flavorless dishes that do not appeal to me at all. Everything tastes the same-buttery, low sodium. Too healthy. Not tasty at all.I do not blame the author - perhaps the reason the dishes taste bad is because I am vegetable-averse and miss the flavor of bacon."
1,vegetarian cooking for everyone,I like pictures and this is more for the older user as far as years being a vegetarian but not for a new commer. I found I had no idia what is was to look like and without the visual aid I did not like it it is still on my shelf.
1,I did not like this book.,"As a new vegetarian, I was looking for cookbooks, and I saw this one had a lot of positive reviews. I also thought Chez Panisse Vegetables might be what I was looking for. Chez Panisse Vegetbles is wonderful (I gave it five stars) and I returned this one. I did not like the format and it was not a very easy read.Chez Panissa Vegetables gave you a description of vegetables from A-Z and then gave you easy recipes. I also ordered Chez Panisse for my aunt who has been a vegetarian for several years and she loved it."
5,Better than Joy of Cooking,"As a most of the time Vegetarian, I find myself reaching for this book for basic cooking questions, inspiration and to improve my knowledge of cooking techniques. I have great success with the recipes I try. (Some favorites are the watermelon salad with mint, lime juice and feta, warm asparagus salad on arugula with walnut vinaigrette). I also love the inclusion of Southwestern flavors - as a Colorado girl it's comfy. But there are lots of French and Italian and Asian ispired dishes, as well as what I call ""classical"" vegetarian - a focus on whole grains and vegetables and beans for a delicious meal.The drawbacks are that it is heavy and big and can feel overwhelming if you are in a hurry. But Debra talks you through a lot of things that if you have patience and persistance, you can master, too!A good wedding or graduation gift or a life line to a family cook whose teenager has just announced he/she is a vegetarian.Bon appetit!"
5,My favorite recipe book.,What's not to like?Easy to follow recipes using ingredients that are easy to find.Her recipes tend to be easy on the spices so feel free to make your own adjustments.I've never made a bad meal from this book.
2,good but time consuming recipes,"I'm a member of a food coop (in Minnesota) and eat vegetarian 3-4 days a week. Having said that I can't really recommend this book. Too many recipes with too many ingredients with too many sauces/salsas that have to be made along with the main part of the recipe in order to make the food palatable, plus too few recipes for everyday use. Maybe if I had all day to cook and lived in California where I'd have easier access to the ingredients I could recommend this book.Although not a vegetarian cookbook, I'd recommend ""Classic Indian Cooking"" by Julie Sahni which contains many vegetarian recipes, some simple, some complex, some vegan and some with milk and butter along with meat recipes as well."
4,Good book!,Nice book with good recipes. My mom love to cook and she was thrilled by this gift. Good book! :)
5,very good cookbook,I bought this for my daughter who is a starter cook and vegetarian. She really likes it. Thinks it is easy to understand and enjoys the recipes. I have even found quite a few recipes to try from this book.
5,Just a Great Cookbook,"I was looking for some recipes to add variety to the menu and to provide some new ideas for using vegetables. Every recipe I've tried to so far has worked wonderfully. The recipes are not too difficult, and the flavors have been really nice. I would recommend this book to anyone. I'm really happy with it."
5,Fabulous!,"This wonderful cookbook is great for vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike. Gives great ideas, has been a wonderful addition to my cookbook collection. It is well-used."
2,Overwhelming and Obscure,"After reading all the great reviews of this book, I found myself very disappointed with it. I wanted something simple that gave everyday recipes, but instead found thousands of obscure recipes such as ""artichokes stuffed with bread crumbs, capers and herbs"" ""eggplant rollatini with fresh mozzarella and Goat cheese"" and ""tunisian eggs with grilled pepers and harissa"".If you are my type of person who would rather be reading ""Julie and Julia, my year of cooking dangerously"" than stuffing artichokes, then this book is not for you. I would say that this is much more gourmet cooking than ""everyday""."
2,"Standard recipes, layout of the book not enticing to try something","I am by all accounts a very good cook, so what I am looking for is actually more an inspiration about what to cook than how. This book gives me little incentive in this respect. Especially a vegetarian cook book should follow the seasons in which vegetables are plentiful and fresh, each recipe should have a picture, and - very important - in this day and age it is ridiculous not to add nutritional information for each recipe. Furthermore, the recipe themselves are boring: especially vegetarian cooking allows the exploration of many new and exciting flavors and asks for the usage of lots of different and unusual spices, none of which are in this book. So if you love to cook and like to eat - this is not the book you want to buy."
5,an incredible cookbook,"This book is one of the best cookbooks I've ever owned. It contains simple, week-night recipes, as well as more complex recipes perfect for entertaining. The soup recipes are fantastic, and there are some great bread and desserts as well. Highly recommended for beginning and advanced cooks."
5,Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,"I am 56 years old and have been a vegetarian for 30+ years, and this is the first cookbook - and I've all the favorites - that I am reading from cover to cover. Yes, it has great recipes. But, more than that, it really teaches one how to cook: how things go together, what various ingredients really do, how to peel things well, how to hard-boil the perfect egg. I have enjoyed the conversational style, the good advice, and the wonderful recipes."
5,"Elegant, Extraordinary, Astonishing","Too many vegetarian recipes yield what looks, and tastes like, Wheaties covered with Cheez Whiz scorched in some horrible casserole.This book, by contrast, is Le Cordon Bleu for vegetables. The gratins of pumpkin, squash, cauliflower, leeks and potatoes are magnificent. The spicy harissa sauces and preserved lemons on chickpeas would grace the best tables of Tunis and Marrakech. Virgin olive oil, fontina, gruyere, parmesano reggiiano, and feta will tingle the tongue and satisfy the soul. The only word to apply to this remarkable book, its author, and its recipes is elegant.This is food for friends and family, to be enjoyed with flutes of deep reds and mellow whites. You can be a vegetarian AND a bon vivant, yet avoid the disagreeable, hair-shirt rectitude of the Food Police!"
5,Fine collection of recipes.,A nice collection of vegitarian recipes that doesn't stoop to silly recipe names or the common novely approach to vegetarian cooking. A good addition to any library of cookbooks regardless of if one eats meat or not.
5,Great book for both the vegetarians and carnivores,"This arrived today and I thumbed through it riveted. I can't wait to get started. I've got 2 other vegetarian cookbooks and this one beats both hands down. I love the notes in the page margins that give information about the recipes, either how to serve, what to serve with or a quick history of the ingredients."
4,Great basic cookbook,"This is a great basic cookbook to have around, even for non-vegetarians. I have made many things from this book with success. Deborah Madison covers a lot of ground here with pages and pages of useful recipes like various types of salsas and sauces, breads, pizza dough, etc."
5,cooking book,This is my favorite cooking book even thought I am not a beginner and I know most of the thinks she is talking about at the beginning at the book. It is a complex cooking book. I love it.
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this book. I am a vegetarian since I believe in the strong scientific evidence that this is the most healthful way to eat. However, I found that too many recipes required liberal amounts of oil or butter, most definitely unhealthy. Also many of the recipes required ingredients I'd never heard of and are not available in local supermarkets.I returned the book to Amazon."
2,Couldn't do it,"Our youngest is off to college in a few months and I wanted to start generating some healthier meals for my husband and myself, so I ordered several new cookbooks from Amazon.I really wanted to like this cookbook, but I don't. I suppose if I didn't work and had time to first of all find the ingredients, many of which are new to me, and secondly to have the time to cook these recipes, the meals themselves might be good, but I don't, so this is one cookbook collecting dust."
2,skip it,"I would say this book should be checked out at the library and thumbed through. I would not suggest purchasing it. Time consuming recipes, hard to follow, disorganized... It's not worth the high price, especially for someone that is cashing in on vegetarian cooking and she's not even a vegetarian. Buy a cookbook from a vegetarian author."
3,Giant Wooden Spoon Scares Me,"I am not a vegetarian although I do eat more non-meat meals than meat meals. So far, this book hasn't really done anything for me. It is quite complete - you should be able to find a recpe for just about any vegetable/grain on the planet but none of the recipes seem to stand out. I am sill looking for that indispensable vegetarian cook-book. I will continue to give this book a chance but I do not have high hopes for it."
2,I simply can't give it more,"Why?Recipes like Add flour to water then dump the water after cooking. Why on earth would you add an ingredient that does nothing? Cooking times are a bit off also and she keeps saying millet clumps. I am trying very hard but so far my millet has never clumped. Now one of us is doing it wrong and since millet is not suppose to clump, I don't get the impression it is me. I can see why the former owner of mine assisted a library sale."
5,Vegetarian bible,"I am not a vegetarian, but love to cook vegetarian dishes with the wonderful fresh produce available year-round in California. It is one of the best cookbooks I have ever used -- a staple from the moment it entered my life.Every recipe I have made from this cookbook has been excellent, and I love the way it is so complete and compendious, so that you can find every ingredient, condiment, technique, ethnicity, type of meal, etc., within it. I will be giving this book as a wedding gift to at least two couples this year. I cannot recommend this cookbook highly enough."
1,Worthless on Kindle,"The e-book version has no index, no links, etc. You have to read it like a novel, from front to back, which is worthless for a cookbook."
5,It 's growing on me :),"Great veggie cookbook for anyone trying to spice up their veggies. I'm trying my hand at being ""quasi-vegetarian"". I was told to buy as she is the Queen of the recipes. So far so good. Actually, tolerating life as I cut back on my beef."
5,Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,"Written by the Deborah Madison of Green's restaurant in San Francisco. I have bought cook books before and ended up never using them. But I have already made several of the dishes and so far liked them all. If you need to get out of a cooking rut, this is a great book to get you to try something different without too much trouble."
4,Fascinating New way of eating,"My new daughter-in-law is a vegetarian and we do love her dearly. Therefore, I have embarked on a mission of becoming adept at preparing vegetarian meals. Now hubby is a confirmed carnivore, so immediately a problem exists. But I have made a couple of things in this cookbook already and they have been delicious. And hubby thought so too. He has eaten the vegetarian dinners and HAS NOT COMPLAINED!!! That is quite a tribute to this cookbook."
5,My Favorite Cookbook from a Cookbook Junkie,"This cookbook covers the spectrum of recipes from salad dressings to desserts, breads, pizza, soups and stews, and every vegetable that most people can find in the grocery store. This is my favorite cookbook. Although I gave up the vegetarian lifestyle several years ago, I use this cookbook every week. I love to cook and Deborah makes recipes easy to follow and pretty fast to make, although prepping vegetables takes up most of the cook time.I am a cookbook junkie and own an embarrassing amount of cookbooks, but if I was limited to only one cookbook, it would be Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone."
5,Otherwise known as my bible...,"If you only own one vegetarian cookbook, this should be the one. It's comprehensive, informative, approachable and ultimately outstanding.I have MANY vegetarian/vegan cookbooks and this is still the one I go to time and time again for information, ideas and well-loved classic recipes. It's like calling your mom (sorry Deborah) to ask her ""How do I cook...?"" I always know Deborah will have the answer for me.I'd list all of my favorite recipes, but they've got a character limit on these reviews..."
5,A classic. I highly recommend this book.,"When I was 18 my mother gave me The Good Housekeeping Cookbook. This cookbook has been her guide most of her married life, and has served me well for more than ten years. Unfortunatly, as a mostly meatless eater I have struggled at times to ""fix"" the recipes so that they fit my lifestyle. For Christmas this year I was given Deborah Madison's book. I own many vegetarian cookbooks but they often contain complicated recipes that need a lot of prep time. Ms. Madison's cookbook will fill a long needed void by providing a reference cookbook, filled with classic reciepes and techniques, all geared towards a vegetarian lifestlye. It is a perfect book for a new vegetarian... or even my Mom! My Good Housekeeping Cookbook will always be a part of my kitchen shelf, but it will have a new permanent neighbor."
4,Great techniques and combinations,"We are not a vegetarian household, but we eat a lot of veggie dishes and meals. This book is a great resource."
1,Ugh...,"I have to say I bought this book for when the author was coming to the local library. I wanted it to get signed, but I wasted my money. She is pretentious as are her recipes. Most of the ingredients are unfindable and/or are expensive. The author isn't even vegetarian and spent most of her time talking at our library complaining about publishing houses, which my father worked for a publishing house for 20 years. Awkward. There may be great recipes in this book, but the author completely turned me off."
1,Makes you want to bang your head,"I do not understand how this book received an award. The recipes are so bland. No innovation here. Thankfully, I never bought it. Found much better titles in the store."
5,extremely informative plus tasty recipes!,"i recently bought this book after reading the 30 plus reviews about it on this page. i knew that there would be no nutritional info, and the layout would be weird. so, i was fully prepared not to buy it. instead i fell in love with it. i think someone called it the vegetarian joy of cooking and i have to agree. it gives basic information like how to use a knife, etc., then onto appetizers, soups, salads... she also includes recipes for tofu and tempeh and tips on how to use marinades for both. some of the recipes are basic, but many have tantalizing flavor combinations that i find unique and refreshing. what i really like about this cookbook is that the ingredients are easy to find in a good supermarket or natural foods store, or better yet, farmer s market. this cookbook can't be THE cookbook for everyone, but it certainly is for me."
4,Creativity Explained,This film shows the creative process at work. I was interested in how Richter let the art dictate its direction and waited till the art told him it was finished.
3,Encryption,"When I tried to play the DVD I got the following message:To play this BD, you must renew the encryption key.Perform a system software update to renew theencryption key.I do not know how to do this, and I should not need to do.However, I was able to download the update and get into theDVD player and the quality is very high. Mr. Richter statesthat painting cannot be explained, so I will not try."
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Some good, old fashioned monster hunting. A death in New York leads to a vampire in Romania, the possible offspring of something a lot worse.The team gets a new member when a homunculus is discovered, and finally, have to deal with that witchy-poo Baba Yaga and some other strangeness.More top notch Hellboy goodness."
4,Getting closer...,"This volume came much closer to meeting my hopes and expectations from this series than Hellboy Volume 1: Seeds of Destruction did. I really liked the story as well as the art, and enjoyed Mike Mignola's take on some of the ideas from mythology and history.More importantly, there was stuff that made me think 'Ooh, I like this!' which is generally a good sign. I didn't love it, but it's closer to ""really liked it"" than ""liked it"" so I gave it the extra star, and I'm excited to read Hellboy Volume 3 The Chained Coffin and Others (which was the one that originally caught my interest) and beyond."
3,Before Buying This Book Read This,I've experienced some of these Masters and I believe (despite the challenge many people have with believing in them) that they are real. I also wonder why some people have such a problem with believing in anything outside of their own faith (hence the attacks on Eckankar). When you talk about beings that can move into other dimensions I also believe that who we are as Soul can do the same. Worth checking this book out....
4,amazing!,"i found the book to be, not only highly intesting but helpful to me personally.i recomended to those who wish themselves to experience the things the book is talking about to read it. if you have a loving trusting heart thats not afraid of a spiritual adventure into the core YOU thats conncted to ALL life the book gives some great spiritual exercises to start you on your way !"
5,Wonderful Book.,"Wonderful book about the Eck Masters. We here experienced the same encounters as some of the encounters described in the book - which was way cool! I guess its a good book to read once you've had your own experiences with the HU and want to look try to see where you were. It's sort of like a map in that sense.I wouldn't recommend it to someone who's new to meditation because it will only make you think that the book planted ideas into your head. Meditate for a couple of months or years to gather your own experiences, then pick up a book if you're interested. But that's just my advice folks. You do what you want."
2,Hard to find an original moment...,"...in fact, I couldn't. Halfway through the second track you've already heard four or five moments that have been lifted directly off of various Bowie albums. Sure, inspiration is one thing, but this album is so derivative it comes across as second-rate Pulp or Roxy Music.It's quite sad because I love British Sea Power's debut; it was nothing like this wannabe-mainstream crossover, however. Now they have added so many strings and melodramatic, overly used melodies that it sounds something like Bowie meets Meatloaf. Ugh.If you have their first album and think the highlights are the raw chords, the half-sung half-spoken vocals, and punky vibe, then you will find nothing to like on Open Season, unless you're such a Bowie fan that slavish imitations like this album are also your thing. After such a unique debut, this is a serious disappointment."
2,My feelings are hurt,"I have never waited for an album like I waited for this one. I spoke to a man at the music store to ensure what day it would be out. I drove straight there after work and purchased the cd. I planned an extra long route to my social engagment so that I could listen to the whole album whilst driving. I almost cried, I was so dissappointed. Screw all this ""I wasn't expecting it but..."" I, for one, don't like it. I just don't. I haven't even finished listening to the whole album. It makes me feel different than the Decline made me feel and now the good feelings associated with Decline have been destroyed by the not goodness of Open Season. I feel it is lacking in passion and that is what I enjoyed so much from the Decline album. This album is background music at best."
2,"A bore, simple as that","British Sea Power are being lauded as an eccentric English band with songs about the North Pole ( Oh Larsen B ) and playing concerts at the Chelsea Flower Show but they are so crushingly boring it's unreal. Admittedly the album starts off nicely but within 2 or 3 songs you notice that it becomes more of the same stuff again and again. The production on this is horrible as it just gives off a horrible lumpiness to the proceedings. If it were handled with a little more care, perhaps it might have sounded less forced. To their credit though the band have admitted this and that's fine by me.Incidentally, they've been playing a freeform gig with legendary Krautrock gods Faust. Apparently the drummer was doing one of these long drum solos which pissed off the lead singer of Faust so much that the singer went over and started punching him in the face and led to a bit of a brawl. The drummer ended up with a black eye. Ouch"
4,a good effort,"with so many bands out there vying for your attention, you have to do a little research (unless you have a lot of cash). i admired the first BSP record because they waited till the middle of the disc to showcase the best songs--whether or not that was haphazard, who knows? BSP's new thing has a mellower vibe to it--it's not so intense. but that is good--because the intensity (like that of the odious Interpol) was purloined from a band hardly anyone remembers called KITCHENS OF DISTINCTION. BSP are better than THE SHINS, THE DECEMBERISTS, that godawful kid BRIGHT EYES; they are not nearly as good as the following: THE WEDDING PRESENT, THE BLACK WATCH, or THE SUGARPLASTIC."
3,CD starts strong but then loses steam,"While I generally like offbeat, very stylistic bands British Sea Power hasn't found the right balance for me. The sound is interesting without being addicting IMHO."
2,Someone get this man some caffeine!,"Geez man, live a little! The vocalist is all but rocking out on this release, which is fine, but it drags the musicians behind him to fall asleep. I was referred this by gnod.net because I really just now learned that I like My Morning Jacket and wanted to see what other bands sound like them. But this is kind of like tranquilizer rock.The jist of the album is that this band wants to recall Simple Minds and Billy Corgan's quietest, softest tracks. That's what I got from it. They really want to make pop songs about nothing but leaving life behind using breathy vocals and a weak backing band. And then to top it all off, they try getting crazy for the last song to make up for not having energy throughout any of the other tracks. A total bore album with no backbone or originality."
2,Very Overpriced,"The product, admittedly, isn't TERRIBLE, but it is vastly overpriced. The plastic was on the thin side. And I was a little surprised to learn that the magnet didn't take up the entire back side of the frame (it's an ordinary square magnet glued to the back of the frame.... which doesn't make it as strong). But it's fine. My picture sits in the frame fine, even though it seems like it could easily slip out. It looks fine. The magnet seems strong enough. But honestly, it was NOT worth $9+. It looks like I should have paid $2-3 for this thing, tops. For $9 I expected more durable plastic, a larger/stronger magnet, etc.This magnet frames serves its purpose but it's kind of a rip-off."
5,The Best,Tragedy Khadafi is one of the best M.Cs alive possibly THE BEST his verses are deep and his word play is put together so nice its almost hard to believe.Personally i cant think of another rapper with the skills he displays.Now as for his albums i cant choose one i like better than another thats like asking me which one of my kids i love better LOL.So all i can say is get them all.Yo Biggy was nice 2pac was nice but Tragedy is on another level.PEASE
4,"One of the best, if slightly sappy, comic strips going","This is a collection of Rose Is Rose comic strips, one of the few decent ones not to appear in the Washington Post (along with Foxtrot and maybe Funky Winkerbean). They're a bit sappy at times: son Pasquale has a helpful guardian angel and is too good to be believed. On the other hand, the artwork is excellent and some of the ideas superb. Rose, the mother, has recurring fantasies of being a biker babe, which are brought out at odd moments. Dad is a great tease, at one point getting onto his knees with his shoes under them and telling Pasquale that he got that way because he didn't eat his vegetables. Certainly very entertaining."
5,Great kids' book!,"This is the beautiful story of a small kitten who is born in a candy store and needs a home. If you've read it, you may remember the image of a kitten who has been accidentally dyed blue. You may also remember how heartwarming it is when a sad little kitten and sad little girl find happiness together.The story, while clearly from a bygone era, is still memorable. It's a great read--I'd highly recommend it to anyone who can get his/her hands on a copy!"
1,Unintentional Self-Parody,"Bob Levey claims to care deeply about good writing. But he ignores Strunk and White's admonition that the writer should always keep himself in the background. Indeed, Flaubert once said that the writer ""must be like God on the page, present everywhere yet visible nowhere."" Unfortunately, Levey inserts himself into nearly every one of the chapters (as he does in his insipid Washington Post columns), when it is clear the book would have been decent if he had stayed out of it.This book does have some scarce nuggets. The history of Washington is indeed riveting, but not because of any pedestrian rendering by Levey. Unfortunately, Levey is not qualified to handle the material, and the reader is left only to speculate about how good this book could have been in the hands of a more talented writer.Reviewers sometimes lament that good trees have been felled to publish a lousy book. In this case, I feel sorry for even the ink and glue."
5,Wonderful Adventure for Kids in early Elementary years,"My children loved all 3 of these adventures, which we listened to in the car on a trip via the audiotape version. They laughed at the adventures of the kids, learning as we went about Pirates, Dinosaurs, and Knights. These are written with ""old style"" magic -- no darkness or evil overtones -- and my kids responded to it beautifully, requesting additional versions for later trips. My husband and I didn't suffer much either. I strongly recommend this collection for those who have early elementary kids (mine are 6 and 8 years old), whom they don't think are ready for Harry Potter and some of that ilk."
4,One Mre Chance Is CLASSIC MADONNA,"OMC I s a great Cd single from Madonna. Only released over seas, it includes a spanish version of You'll See, along with a Spanglish mix of You'll see. It takes you back to the feeling of what the album Something to remember was all about. A defenite must have for any fan, and a dissapointment for Americans because we never had this masterpiece as a single"
5,one more for the collection,"this is a definite for any madonna fan, this cd will be a great addition to any cd collection, get it while you can"
1,Why?!?,"Why was this placed on the nearly perfect ""Something to Remember""? This track is hardly memorable. It is trite, sappy, and more cliche than the average Celine track. Furthermore, why was this released as a single?Madonna could've easily replaced this piece of trash with something more worthy, such as ""Promise to Try"" or ""Spanish Eyes."" Granted, both are rather old songs, but it would've flowed well with the album.I guess we can't have it all... *sigh*"
2,"Cute, but not useful.","I bought this because the name was just too darn cute and I thought it might keep me dry during diaper changes. Unfortunately, it doesn't stay put on the wee-wee, especially when little legs are moving around. A burp cloth thrown over the wee-wee is actually much more practical."
1,A major disappointment,"This calendar is a complete waste of money.The questions cover only about five of over fifteen seasons.The art is limited and repetitive, often not even from the episode referenced.Considering how impressive the Simpsons wall calendar is, this should have been much better."
1,DO NOT LIKE!!!!!!!!!,"i already have this ""DTB"", but would buy this for my kindle, love everything this author has written, JUST WISH YOU GUYS WOULD GET ON THE KINDLE RIDE Have been all over the net looking for this author's books. some of the people, are asking for HUGEamounts of $$$$$$ for these books. READING is my right as a human being, and to charge the prices you do, MAKES ME SICK. the author and publishers just out for the MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Before you buy. . DOES NOT COME WITH EXTENSIONS,"Before you buy this item makes sure you already have the 25"" upright extensions that actually hold these shelves up. Otherwise, you will need to special order them. These are shelves only, and do not come with the brackets (extensions) that attach to the wall. This in no way should be called a ""kit"". After buying shelves and extensions, you are economically better off ordering an entire closet kit and having leftover pieces for another closet or laundry room than buying these items seperately."
4,Very Usefull Item !!!,I bought four of this item so I can complete my walk-in closet. They were delivered promptly and it was very easy to assemble. The bad side is that I had to buy extensions separetly so I can fis them to the walls...I think it should have been provided in the box... and the sipping of the extension is a ripp off : a single tiny long piece of metal in a very large box that could contain 20 of those pieces... WHY ????? ?????
1,Deceptive Picture,The picture for these shelves is deceptive. You only get the shelves and nothing to attach the arms. The description says you get brackets but you do not get all of the brackets. I would not have made this purchase if I knew I was not getting what was pictured in the advertisement. The shelves are totally worthless unless you make another purchase. Poor performance on the part of Amazon.
1,No Uprights!,"This whole listing is misleading - both pictures of the product clearly show the uprights and the description indicates that all mounting hardware is included. I would like the seller to explain to me the process for mounting these shelves to a wall, using only the included hardware."
2,mismatched,I put up these shelves and noticed one shelf was a different size then the other self.contacted seller told me to call rubbermade.I guess I should of got this item at a store.
4,organizing,"good quality, but did not include upright base pieces as shown in picture, so if looking for new shelving be prepared to need additional pieces."
1,I would think twice before ordering from Target online again.,"This item wasn't offered in stores so I ordered it online through Amazon. The shelves came mismatched (one shelf was deeper than the other) and since I really needed them in place I didn't have time to send them back for a replacement. I just think it's pretty shotty of Target to not be more careful with their products and repackaging, especially when people have to order them online."
1,Mismatched shelves,Absolutely awful. Not only is the mounting hardware not included (you can get it for like 10 bucks at home depot) but one shelf is deeper than the other. This would have been ok if the brackets actually fit it but the front edge of the second shelf is resting on the absolute tip of the bracket. I wouldn't put 10 lbs on it without fear of it collapsing. Save yourself the headache and get something with all the correct pieces.
2,misleading,Lame. There's no uprights included to hold these shelves up. Don't let the picture fool you: this item includes only (2) shelves and (4) brackets/braces. There's no way to put these shelves up unless you obtain the uprights and hang track elsewhere.
1,Does not come with mounting equipment,"This product is shelves only. Unless you already have the uprights, this product should not be purchased. This was very misleading. Even the box says that it includes uprights in all configuration kits, but it does not."
2,No Bars to hold the shelves,"Maybe I am just not familiar with the Rubbermaid shelving system. They shelves DO NOT come with the bars to install them on the wall. I wish the description could have made it clear that you'll need to purchase the extension bars. My son was disappointed because with the extra cost of the extension bars, they become too expensive. Had to return them."
4,"Adjustable, affordable closet organizer","For closet organization, I chose the Configurations line because it was sturdy, affordable and versatile.I live in a 60's Ranch house with sliding door closets. So far, I've done two closets, and love them. I can get a lot more in each closet and it's more organized. For best access, I replaced the sliding doors with folding doors in one room, and plan to do the same in the master.Love the metal construction."
3,Misleading picture,"The wall rods in this picture should be grayed out or made so they are obviously NOT included in the purchase. Beware - this is not the complete shelf kit! I'll be making a trip to Lowe's to find the rest of this. Oh, and I also had a big fat roach run out of the box as I hoped it. Won't be buying anything from amazon again."
5,They are Beautiful,I purchased these glasses for the holidays. I love them and the detail on the glass. I have gotten many complements and I am thinking of ordering another set. The price was perfect too.
1,So sad,This was to be a beautiful gift for my daughter for Christmas but when it arrived yesterday the stem of glass number 5 was broken. I will be returning the set after she sees what I bought her. I may buy another set but only if I can be assured that it will be packed correctly. Thank you
4,Buen micro,Buen micro para el bombo de la bateriaLlego en perfecto estado..Trabaja muy bien con cualquier tipo de bombo o bass drum.
5,Rod's Been Good To Us All,"This book is one of my favorites, and I have them all but one.As always Rod speaks directly to you and never misses the mark. Page 22 is my favorite. I always feel Rod knew me in another life and you will feel it too. This is a must for every collector."
3,I was disappointed,"From the title, I thought I was getting lots of suggestions about foods to prepare for the beginning eater to toddler. I have rasied all my own children and now my children and their friends are having their first babies. I remembered how I poured over baby ""cook books"" to learn how to prepare good, simple, tasty and inexpensive food for my children. I want to give the same resources to new mothers. This book looks like it will give you lots of ideas but it contains much of the same material you find in ""the first (second etc) year of your child's life"" which is a wonderful series. Sorry but I was not impressed."
5,Best I have found,"Worth the price.I tried others and this is the only one that creates a rock solid connection and is easy to use.Follow directions and the hitch stays in place until you remove it.Some attention needs to be taken as some hitches would not allow the space to use this, but for 80-90% of applications this is the way to go.Eliminates all side to side and up/down motion. If concerned about hitch get a locking hitch pin.Need a good wrench to tighten and loosen, size about 18mm or so from what I recall."
5,hitch stabalizer,this product really stopped the wobble in my reciever hitch. i use it to stabalize a carrier for my mobility scooter. before i installed it i had a side to side wobble of about 3-4 inche vertyicle wobble. with it installed i hav no wobble at all. really works great
4,Application: Motocycle Hitch Mounted Cargo Hauler,Expensive but it does works. Hauling a 350 pound motorcycle on the back of a mid-size truck. The cargo hauler came with a weakly designed threaded pin tightener that helped remove about a third of the play in the receiver hitch. But others have stated you need something like this bolted clamp to remove all the play. Cruising down the highway with a motorcycle rocking back-an-forth on your ass end ain't no fun! If you have the time and can find the metal drill a couple of holes and buy a U-Bolt and save a buck? Git-R-Done Larry!
1,"great idea, poor quality","I was looking specifically for ankle nylon socks and was excited to find these. However, the quality is very cheap. Imagine buying CVS brand knee highs; that is what the quality is like. The color is also very dark, so they don't look good with shoes. They are also very thick and bunch up. I wouldn't buy these again, in fact I threw them out."
1,Horrid,"First, they were not sold by the twelve-pack, but sent two six packs to make it necessary to buy more than I needed. Then, after wearing one pair for a few hours, the ankle-highs split at the seam on the toe. At first I thought I might have snagged them, but the split was a perfect disconnect along the sewing line of the seam. I tried another pair, and another, and out of the six I tried, four split the same way completely across the seamline. I haven't opened the other pack of six - I plan to throw them out - not worth the money to return them. BAD PRODUCT!!! POORLY MADE!!!! NO NOT PURCHASE!!! Throwing away your money. If there was a way to give this product NO stars, that would be my preference.All Nylon Ankle High, 12-pk"
4,GREAT,ANOTHER ITEM MY ELDERLY MOTHER WAS LOOKING FOR THAT SHE HAS BEEN WEARING FOR 100 YEARS AND CAN'T FIND IN THE STORES ANYMORE.. THANK GOD FOR AMAZON.
2,Bought two - neither works,"I am very unhappy with the purchases. The watch is BEAUTIFUL. Does it work? Not so muchI bought the watch recently for my fiance. Congrats? Not really?We opened the box. Beautiful. We set the time. Two days later, it was still the same time. It was broken.The face is so small that a watch store could not install a new battery.I asked Amazon to exchange. Guess what? No exchanges allowed, only returns.Would Amazon pay for shipping because it was not our fault? Guess what....no. And they require you to insure it so you are paying an arm and leg in returning it.I therefore ordered another one. Got the watch. What happened? Doesn't work.So my thought is this. Go get it at a reputable store. Stuff sold by Amazon...what a headache:-("
3,Problems with Gucci Twirl watch,"Ordered and received Gucci Woman's watch, model YA112503. Absolutely NO paperwork was included; i.e., no owner's manual, no invoice, no certificate of authenticity, etc. When unwrapped for Christmas, found the watch not working; the battery was dead. Extremely disappointed that Amazon would ship an expensive product in this condition."
1,Buyer Beware......,I purchased this item as a gift for my wife. I experienced the same exact thing as the previous buyer.The watch arrived and the battery did not work. We called Amazon and they sent another watch out andthat battery did not work either. We decided on taking the watch to a jeweler and pay to have him replacethe battery. I guess these watches sit in a mass warehouse and no one checks the watch before they areshipped. Bad bussiness for amazon. Amazon did give me $40.00 refund for my trouble. This experience with amazon left abad taste in my mouth and no $$$$ can replace the same mistake twice. Please don't waste your money or time buying thisproduct from amazon. They are cheap for a reason....... You pay for what you get.
2,rarely needed,"I bought this antenna as it was less expensive than the original Garmin one. However, its very long cord is very cumbersome in the car. Anyway, I found out that an external antenna is rarely needed. I imagine that it will let the GPS acquire satellites more quickly in some locations."
3,"Enjoyed parts of the book, other sections annoyed me.","The author's first attempt to enter a convent struck me as a romantic leap that was not thought out at all. It was almost as if she just woke up one morning and decided this is what she should do, whether it was right for her or not. Her second attempt came across much better. This time she tried to think things out, and seemed to be honestly trying to find out if the convent was where she belonged. There were moments that were very amusing, moments that were very trying, and moments when I wondered how she managed to last as long as she did in the religious life."
2,Image isn't bright..,The color in this poster looks faded and old. Was not expecting it to arrive like this. Really disappointed. Honestly looks like it was printed in the 70's.
5,Very moving,"I'm a first time reader of Lillian Lee, and I'm already a fan. The book is very well written, especially in the latter part of the book. But maybe it's just the (almost)true story of this used-to-be innocent girl that's touching me. A good read."
2,"Mildly entertaining, easily forgotten","For the first time, I prefer the translated version of a book over the original. The original is packed with clichés, making it unbearable. Somehow the translation was able to breath some freshness into this otherwise uninspired piece, but nothing can save it from its superficial characters. Amongst the contemporary novelists of Hong Kong, Lillian Lee no doubt is, and deservingly so, the most well received writer by both the critics and readers in general, but even her work suffers from the same ailment as other novels from Hong Kong: The lack of originality. Each book reads exactly the same as any other book by the same author. There's hardly any variation in either style or technique. This is one of those books that are mildly entertaining but quickly forgotten after you turn the last page."
3,Typical romance with heart,"Any book by Kathleen Gilles Seidel should be on your ""must-read"" list if you love intelligent romance novels and three dimensional characters. While this book is not one of her best, it is very enjoyable and certainly of a better quality than most Harlequin novels."
4,Best Harlequin Romance,"I've had this book for years and whenever I need a lovely romance, it's one of the books that I turn to. The story of how a young girl matures in the face if her chosen adversity and how the young man matures in different ways is just a joy to read. I also enjoyed the information on the state parks and outside canoeing adventure. Nice characterization of the other key roles as well."
1,Displeased customer,"I feel like I have been lied to. When I received this costume I pulled out the dress and tried it on. The dress came to my knees!! I was very upset. Immediately I went to get the dress package to see if I had accidentally ordered a child's. I had ordered the correct size, it was just a fraud. In the picture it came to the models feet. It said the model was 5'6. I am a small framed 5'5, and I ordered a large/medium (the largest size they had)! It also said on the package a hat was included. I did not receive a hat in the package. This company has a bad mark with me. I will NEVER use this dishonest company again. NEVER! I tried contacting them so I could return this item 2 days ago. I haven't heard anything back from them. Big surprise!"
1,don't waste your time or MONEY!!,"Ordered this for my 12 year old daughter, who is a huge ""Gone with the Wind"" fan! She soooo wanted to be Scarlett for Halloween this year - looks like she will have to choose someone/something else...this costume is a huge disappointment!! Very poor quality! Plastic skirt w/tulle layered over & the seams are not even sewn together! Looks nothing like the picture!! I ordered her a size small adult, sizing states that it would fit up to a size 8. The package states that the model on the front of package is 5'6"" and it shows the gown to be floor length no feet showing. My daughter is 5'4"" and the hem comes just below her knee!! I regret ordering something like this on line, and I dread the hassel of returning it and the worry that I will not be refunded without further headaches. Save yourself some time, money and trouble...don't order this item!!"
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this a couple of years ago and while I did not buy it from this particular store or Amazon, I do know it is made by the same company. With that said, it is very poor quality. Every tier came apart at the seams in different places. The hat could not be shaped to look like the one in the picture. Instead it was completely round and looked awful. I didn't have a problem with the length like so many other reviewers had. It did at least come to my feet. If you plan on walking or moving at all in this dress - DON'T BUY IT! Sadly, I thought I could wear this for multiple Halloweens. I wore mine one time and when I got home, it went in the trash."
1,Not what is advertised,"Do not buy this costume. The dress was too short and very cheaply made. Because of the nature of the costume, making do could not be done. Being a Southern Belle, you needed a floor length dress. The hat did NOT come with it as advertised. This costume was way over priced and should not have been for sale in the first place and advertised to be a Southern Belle costume."
1,Would not purchase from company again.,"When the package arrived, it was sealed, however, the dress was torn in several places and the metal piece in the hat was broken. I was not able to wear it and will not purchase items from this company again."
5,great pkg,Couldnt find a better deal anywhere else not even wal-mart. The pkg is great for my son he just loves it.
3,looks nice easy to instal not highest quality,"The lights are very easy to install, put out a decent amount of light (using Toshiba LED bulbs) and look nice. The downside is the base appears to be made of cheap stamped metal and while good looking the nickel pieces that hold the glass in place are mounted on very thin metal that could bend easily. Of the 3 units I bought (2, 12inch and 1, 16 inch) each unit had one of the three glass holders that had to be forced with pliers to be turned allowing the glass to be mounted to the light. Had I not put in LED bulbs with 20 year expected life I would be nervous about breaking the one ""sticky"" glass holder on each unit. All in all it is a good looking decent light but I would be cautious if I had to change the bulbs regularly."
5,Great devotional for lovers of Narnia,"I love this book! I know those Narnia books better than I know my own, so I was skeptical that the book would tell me anything new. But I've gotten a LOT out of the parallels the authors outline. I never considered the spiritual meaning of Father Christmas breaking through the White Witch's winter. Or the Pevensies being ""drawn into"" Narnia by Queen Susan's horn in PRINCE CASPIAN. The authors don't simply cite Biblical parallels - they outline spiritual truths exemplified in some of my favorite passages, and they use many of Lewis' other writings to support their points. I highly recommend this for lovers of Narnia looking for a great devotional book."
4,Great Narnia Companion,I recently got this book at no expense via the Tyndale Rewards system. Great book for any lover of Lewis's stories! I'm planning on giving another copy to a family member who also loves Narnia.
5,interesting cds,I haven't listned to all of it but thinks it will be worth listening and will explain the Land of Narnia
3,Offers Some New Thoughts,"I enjoyed this book (although it disappointed me in some ways). FOLLOWING ASLAN by Kenneth McIntosh is a very similar book, except his is written for young children. Both authors do a good job of tying Narnia, the Bible, and our everyday lives together in a way that makes us realize that there are no lines between the spiritual, the ordinary, and the world of the imagination. Both books make excellent daily devotionals for families. A family with young children could use Bruner's book without too much effort--and although McIntosh's book is written for young children, as an adult, I found spiritual truths there that challenged me. In Bruner's book, I was just hoping he would lead me a little ""further up and further in"" than he did!"
4,Good Book,"This is a good book for mature audiences. I would not allow my younger children to read it, as some of the analogies are disturbing, such as ""God is like a lover, not a rapist."""
2,Not durable,"These are very pretty, with nice, well-fitting lids, but I found that the glass containers were not durable. The largest one chipped the very first time I washed it, though it was still usable. Within less than two years, the two larger containers have broken, only the smaller one remains. I don't think I was particularly hard on them, they just don't seem very durable. I prefer the Snapware Glasslock containers."
3,I like my Bormioli Rocco,"The containers were well-boxed and arrived on time.The containers feel thick and very durable glass. The one and medium containers feel lightweight, not the large one. When I use them, they go from freezer to microwave like a champ. Since they're glass, I don't have to worry about toxic chemicals as I do when I microwave plastic containers.The plastic lids are flexible and easily seal on the containers, but they are not completely leak proof. Because the topsides of the lids have matte finish, the tomato sauce has stained one of the lids. So, next time, I will wash them pretty soon after use. The lid of the largest container has warped after a week of hand washing. When not use, you can stack them and save cabinet space!They're not the best deal around, however. For $24, I could have bought Snapware Glasslock 20-piece set, which after examination may be lightweight yet just as durable."
2,Not as pictured,I would have much preferred a clear see through lid like that which is shown. These came with turquoise lids. In the giant scheme of things it's not a huge deal breaker or something I'd return but I would have far preferred the clear lids as was shown in the picture.
5,Great Product!,Great containers! Being earth friendly these have worked out nicely in my kitchen. They are thick and durable and I am thankful to finally have these.
3,Decent storage,Clear sturdy glass with well-fitting lids. My mistake was in assuming they could be used in the oven. They can not.
2,Disappointed,"I have had the square set for such a long time, after getting so many comments of how others visiting us liked them i decided to gift some for Christmas, sadly they were not as i expected...the frosted plastic lids that were shown in the photograph was not delivered like advertised...this set came with Blue lids , much unlike what i have in my kitchen. Debating on returning for the mis advertised listing. Bummed*"
1,They Leak!!,"The glass containers are everything you would expect from glass microwavable, dishwasher-able, and fragile. We bought a whole set and I had my reservations about the looseness of the lids. I gave it a go for the last 6 months only to see my fears come true all over the inside of my messenger bag. The lids do not seal. That's it. What else could you want in a food storage container???? I am very disappointed in this purchase and I am looking for a better glass container alternative..."
2,Doesn't work,"This product does not work well on hard floors. It is constantly sliding out from under my feet. The heater has never worked, unfortunately I bought it in the spring and did not try to use the heater until months later."
3,Not my favorite,"Although this product serves the purpose of heating my feet, I am disappointed in the overall quality and functionality of it. I think it is too light in weight because it continuously falls over when I have it on the ""radiator"" position. And to be honest, it does not work all that well to warm up my area under my office desk. I'm still freezing. I think in the winter I will break down and get a low noise heating fan, so at least I get some air flow."
3,McGill - Hope you are reading these reviews - needs lower setting,"The McGill Heated Footrest is a better foot warmer than the flat 90 watt rubber unit I used previously. After much searching I decided it was the best value and closest product I could find to replace the worn out flat rubber foot warmer I used before (purchased it from a plumbing supply house). Both are too warm, I have to take my feet off it after a few minutes. McGill could improve this product easily by putting in a lower setting, perhaps 1/2 the heat it puts out now. The symbol on the switch for this setting could be stocking feet."
3,average,"The heat is adequate in the horizontal position. You cant be barefoot on it though, it will be too hot. fuzzy slippers is OK.Biggest con for me is that it squeaks when adjusting angle, kinda annoying"
3,How toasty is TOO toasty?,"I received this gift from a friend who heard about my cold weather toe-woes. It worked fantastically for a while, but it was TOO hot on the lowest setting, even wearing thick socks! I put a small towel just on the top (not totally covering it) and it was much better, however, it soon melted the plastic. Now, if I'd have been using high heat, I could understand it, but on low? Yeah. Not cool. So if you DO get this footrest, keep a close eye on it."
1,"Too hot to put my feet on, then it melted the plastic",I used this for about a month. It was too hot to put my feet on so I had to put two towels over it. Then it overheated and melted the plastic.
1,Heat sensor did not work,"The heat sensor did not work so I sent it back. I received a call from the manufacturer about a week ago that a new one was sent out, I am still waiting for it."
4,Beautifully stimulating.,"I thought it was beautiful, just to be able to look through it very quickly and see all the photographs and read all the stories. Even the paper it's printed on is of a fine texture and makes you realize how worth the book was of your money."
3,Didn't help cradle cap,"I bought this shampoo with hopes to clear up my 4 month old's cradle cap. I have used it for about 2 weeks now. It seems to have helped a little bit, but he still has pretty significant cradle cap. I do like the way it smells and his hair is really soft since beginning to use it. I just wish it cleared up his cradle cap!"
5,"Wonderful, non-stop reading!","I heard about this author through a fellow nursing student and found this book in a book exchange store. Since I read this book, I have searched every bookstore for more. I cannot find this author's work anywhere but Amazon.com. Thanks to Amazon.com for giving me an opportunity to but more of her work."
4,Worth reading,"A very entertaining medical thriller. Although I didn't think this was 'edge of the seat' stuff, Pulse kept my attention, and was responsible for me being very late to bed one night as I '...just wanted to finish these last few chapters!'The final chapter doesn't sit right. Ms Heron should have left us on a high in the garage! Nevertheless, I'll be picking up the next in Adele's saga very shortly."
2,Didn't care for this book,I liked Ms. Heron's non-fiction books but don't care for her fiction. I've read all of her non-fiction books and have read Mercy and Pulse. I also bought her other fiction books which I may not read. She seems to be prejudiced against overweight people.
1,Beyond Lame,"As a nurse, I am appalled by this book. I picked this book up at a resort when someone else left it for the unsuspecting.The writing is trite and poorly executed. The plot is full of holes and dull. I read half of it and left it in the seat back pocket of the airplane as I couldn't bear to bring it back into the country!Nurses as a whole are a good bit smarter and compassionate than Ms Heron makes them out to be. Her ""witty"" banter/dialogue is unbelievable and silly. I suspect there is not a surgeon in the world that would refer to his senior partners as ""blades""....Please!"
3,Nice driving tour itineraries,"Secondary to _Frommer's Best Loved Driving Tours_, Detailed about what you see. Wish they'd include driving times! sketches, no places to stay, a few mentions of to eats. Nothing particularly off the beaten track to it- all itineraries cover major popular towns to see."
4,You'll find this Amos Walker novel to be typical,"The Amos Walker private detective series is one of the best ones currently going, as is also one that a reader who has never indulged can pick up any entry in the series and not feel lost. Loren Estleman has all the moves down by this time for Walker, and ""The Witchfinder"" is typical of the series. Walker has run-ins with the cops, gets mixed up in a homicide investigation, and comes up against an assortment of low lifes and homicidal killers, your typical day at the office. He's hired by a dying millionaire archetect to find out who ""framed"" the love of his life eight years ago and caused him to break off their relationship. The story takes an appropriate number of twists and turns, and as usual Walker remains uncorruptable throughout.Though not among the best of the Walker series (that would be ""Sugartown,"" or ""The Glass Highway""), it is still a solid effort from one of the best P.I.s since Phillip Marlowe."
3,"Good, fast-paced in the Chandler style","This book starring Private Eye Amos Walker is indeed, as advertised, in the Raymond Chandler narrative style. Walker is clever and sardonic, most of the time. A quick read, as Walker sizes up scenes quickly and provides a snapshot to the reader. The plot has a few holes, but a solid ending saves it. One of the characters, a hit-man for city and municipal policiticans and beuracrats, is ludicrous, but overall a pretty good read."
1,Stay away from this book,"I have a solid background in C/C++ and I was hoping to fill in some gaps in other areas with this book. Unfortunately, given the poor quaility of the C/C++ information (and the sometimes-silly stuff in the ""how to interview"" section), I really don't trust what's in the rest of the volume.The C/C++ chapter is divided into ""beginner"", ""intermediate"", and ""advanced"" sections. Instead, they should be labeled ""unbelievably trivial"", ""very trivial"", and ""trivial"". Even worse, much of the information is presented in a misleading or incorrect fashion. I suppose this is to be expected, given that the main credentials of the person who wrote the C/C++ section are a music degree and the ability to play the string bass.If I were giving an interview and I heard a candidate parroting the C/C++ answers in this book, I would promptly show him/her to the door.Instead, get a copy of: ""Programming Interviews Exposed"" by Mongan and Suojanen."
3,Poor Editing,"The book is filled with valuable information but you generally have to read the answers, and sometimes the questions, at least twice because the book is poorly written. It's as if nobody took the time to proofread - which is pretty sad for a FOURTH edition. Even the entries that are well thought out tend to be filled with sentence fragments and clauses, making it very difficult to read and more importantly, COMPREHEND! I'm no English professor but I can recognize when something can be written more clearly."
2,"Good idea, but too many incorrect answers","I liked the concept of this book, presenting some typical questions that might be asked during a technical interview. But in the section that I read (Visual Basic 5.0), I found that many of the answers were totally incorrect. A study guide that gives out wrong info is worse than no study guide at all. To be fair, I only read through the VB5 chapter, and the other chapters may be more accurate. But if you're thinking about purchasing this book, be warned."
3,Useful for more than just scamming your way into a job,"There's a lot of useful information in this book, but I use it for a different purpose than for that which it is advertised. It's good for IT managers and other computer generalists, who want to stay on top of the trends, compare and contrast technologies, etc. For example, I've never worked with Oracle in my life. What does it do? What is included with Oracle? I can answer these basic questions here.The detailed ""sample interview questions"", on the other hand, are completely useless. I would say it is dishonest to pretend you have more experience in technology X than you actually do for the purposes of lying your way into a job for which you are not qualified. Reading the little ""sample questions"" section on X is not going to turn you into an X expert or even a competent X professional, and you won't be able to maintain the illusion long once you are actually on the job, and working with X in all its hairy reality."
1,How to get the best job in the computer industry?,"I think that line (which appears on the cover) should be changed to ""How to get the easiest job in the computer industry?"". The questions in this book are just for beginners(unlike what it says on the cover ""answers to 2000 tough questions""). If you are really looking for a serious job in computer industry, this book is worthless to you."
4,Good book to refresh before interview,The question and answer format makes the book easy to read. Very relevant questions and explanations provided. Handy for a consultant who has to attend interview at the end of every assignment. I gave 8 because each topic needs more pages to be comprehensive.
3,This book comes highly recommended.,"I am ready to do my technical interviews, and the school I attended recommended this book both as a review and a preparation for what to expect on the interview. However, I see that others have found some errors in it. Is there anyone that knows of a book of this type without the errors? Let us know please."
4,ACE the Technical Interview,Should focus more on the questions asked and should seperate C and C++ questions.
3,"Decent length, but lukewarm...","If you really get into the story, this might be pretty good. The art looks like an X-rated daily comic strip, which will probably turn a lot of people off. The sexual content certainly isn't lukewarm, and if you're into ridiculously voluptuous women and guys with penises half the length of their legs (on average), this could be your bag."
2,Preternaturally pretentious,"I guess it's true that there's no accounting for taste. Some people apparently liked this book a lot, but I found it a confusing, boring mish-mash of ideas that failed to jell (or jellyfish) for me.The multiple points-of-view, timeline-manipulation and fourth-wall-breaking can work, but not in this book. In fact, I have the distinct impression that the author got her hands on a copy of Diderot's ""Jacques the Fatalist"" and decided to reprocess some of her half-baked ideas into a similar work. If so, it pales into transparency compared to Diderot brilliant work.The author's love-hate relationship with her characters (and readers, I think) pushed and pulled me from paragraph to paragraph, and left me cold."
2,BASIC BOOK,It's a nice looking book...but why they call this 'Advanced' I don't know. All seem very basic. More for someone who is totally unfamiliar with a camera. Far to basic to be of any real use. Nothing here that was of any real interest. Quick read. But nice pictures. LTS
1,"""Advanced""??? Please!!","I bought this book because I feel I've mastered the basics and was looking for a book on advanced digital photographic techniques. I figured, since this book is titled ""Advanced Digital Camera Techniques"" that this would be such a book. Sorry, it is not. Same old basic stuff...how to choose a digital camera, how to frame an image, blah blah. Nothing advanced here. What a crock."
4,great if you love kitties,"My 12 month old adores this book. We have cats and her first word was ""kitty."" This is by far her most requested book, and she loves that they are real pictures of cats. She likes to imitate the kissing kitties and all that.My daughter's affection aside, as a book I'd rate this only ""ok,"" although I think it's better than some of the other ""busy"" books. The rhymes feel forced and the vocab is not childlike (""strolling,"" ""dozing""). It kind of ends abruptly and doesn't exactly build a narrative. I have it memorized and without a lot of embellishments (actions/sounds) it's pretty boring/repetitive.But if you have a kiddo who loves cats, then I'm sure they will go bonkers for these busy kitties."
5,Meow!,"The entire ""Busy"" series is engaging and fun for kids and parents alike. A great way to introduce your child to books, nature, language."
2,Blurry kitties and a puddle of pee,"Perhaps I lack sophistication and a sense of humor. This book was a complete disappointment. The photos were not sharp or clear. The one of the cats eating (overhead photo of cats around a bowl) was ridiculous for a small child to find the cat. Oh, then let's get a shot of kitty puddles. My grandson loves kittens and I purchased this book for his birthday. It arrived warped and not the quality I expected. This one is going back."
4,I liked it...,"I wish the series was longer. I was sad the only thing on the second disc was ONE episode of Magical Play 3-D (although I do not think there's more than one).This series isn't for everyone but if You've watched enough Anime to point out the jokes and appricate the parody / satire of the Magical Girl series, it can be a lot of fun.Some jokes are a little racy, as are some theemes, but it's nothing I'd be uncomfortable watching with my granny."
4,"An awesome album for those who just discovered ""El Cigala""","This is the debut album of the awesome and handsome Cigala. Undebel is one delicious Rumba. If asked, I would say that it is my favorite Rumba. If you are just discovering flamenco, this is a great album to get acquainted with some basic ""palos"" like ""Bulerias"" and Rumba.Great production, great voice. This album feels modern despite the fact that Cigala is fortunately a strict flamenco singer.The copy that I got for a very good price came from a library, so I guess my copy may not be all the way legal. Unused copies were practically non available."
2,Debbie Travis Facelift - did not live up to expectations.,"I have a collection of five of the Debbie Travis books - this is one (Debbie Travis Facelift) that I really did not enjoy compared to the others by Debbie Travis.This was not a very good ""How to do"" book - instead it only shows end results and most of the rooms shown are limited to a very eclectic or modern style of decorating. My other 4 Debbie travis books show a wide range of styles that basically can appeal to everyone and they show a variety of painting styles and decorating. For me two far more useful Debbie Travis books are Decorating Solutions which was really wonderful, and Painted House which I think is fabulous."
3,I love Debbie Travis but.....,"I loved the Facelift when it was on HGTV but this was dissapointing. All of the gorgeous rooms she designed, I don't know how she decided on these. I would rather have had tiny before and after's like Trading Spaces with tips on how to create the spaces. Needless to say I was pretty dissapointed. For the faux finishers, there are a few faux finishes in the back of the book that she gave step-by step directions for."
3,paradise is more than nice with this british blue eyed soul,"andy fairweather low's vocals is a hybrid of rod stewart and jon anderson, perharps steve perry.to the current generation he is better known as the 2nd guitarist for eric clapton. yet if you can believe it, andy was once a teen idol even before eric. quite an interesting mix of tunes here:2 renditions of beatles tunes with somewhat quite original treatment. a tune of roy wood (move) , a creedance clearwater hit,and some good soul tunes made famous by the greats of the era (sam & dave, otis redding). here amen corner adds their own british blue eyed soul rendering of these chestnuts. enjoyable collection from this welsh group from cardiff. good arrangement and certainly a good album for the pub, after a vigorous match of rugby or football (soccer to those in america). for the european supporters, try ""penny lane"" for the october fest."
5,Fun bag to hit,Quick delivery. This is a fun bag to hit. A must for gym owners. Really allows you to work on your uppercuts. A nice alternative to the standard heavybag. A nice way to mix up your workouts.
3,"Pretty, but tight across the toes/ball of foot","I was really looking forward to receiving these as the color looked great and I love this style of shoe. My feet are average width and these were tight across the toe/ball of foot region. DO NOT wear these if you need to walk alot. You might want to consider bringing a spare pair of flats if you go out in these. They do loosen up a bit after you put them on, but still tight. The color is very pretty though."
4,Beautiful!,"This is a really beautiful and fun craft kit. Includes a very sturdy cardboard house that you decorate and material to make five fairies. My daughter and I spent several hours making the fairies and had a great time. However, she is almost six and had a hard time making the fairies herself. She really enjoyed decorating the house though and had no problem with this part. This would probably be better for an older child unless yours does not mind your help. Overall, this craft kit is worth the money and your child will end up with a very pretty house to play with or just display."
3,Your average run of the mill mystery book.,"I found Pipsqueak to be a mediocre story. The main character Garth Carson seems rather stale and one dimensional, the plot moves rather sluggishly, but there are some moments."
2,Ran Out of Steam,"It took me about two weeks to read the last quarter of this book. Despite other reviews descriptions I didn't find a funny line in the book. A better description would be light reading. It is full of wacky characters but they never do anything which would provoke a laugh. Plus the scifi premise at the heart of the puzzle was outlandish but not interesting. This book is the latest of several books I have read recently that believes that creating a bizzare cast and leaving it at that without any comic development counts as mission accomplished. The story was wrapped up by the end but it left me saying ""Huh?"" because I wasn't sure where the denouement came from."
4,Fun and interesting read,"Once you start reading this book you will be compelled to finish it. The story and the characters are really interesting.I would have to agree with one of the other reviewers that the use of ""dialects"" in the writing is somewhat distracting. But overall I would say that this book is a fun and interesting read."
2,Only mediocre,I read this when it was self-published; bought it at a garage sale. A few months later the author got a deal with Dell. Kind of shocking considering the source material isn't spectacular.The writing is a little too gimmicky for my tastes and there were some geographical error which detracted from the story. Only okay.
2,Lackluster performance at best,"This book was rather painful for me to actually finish, the fact that i did i now consider one of the major accomplishments of my life."
4,A light and fun crime noir book,"This is my first Wiprud book, and I enjoyed it over a nice relaxing weekend. It features some fairly original characters and an unusual plot (as unusual as conspiracy plots get) and breezes right along.The real entertainment for me lay in the offbeat and atypical creations with which Wiprud fills each scene.I did not find this book hilarious, or even remember laughing at any part, but nevertheless, enjoyed it as I followed along as if watching a goofy and upbeat version of an old Bogart crime thriller.For a fun change of pace from regular thrillers, give Pipsqueak a try."
4,Okay,"My brother bought these. They're cheap, and have lots of variety. Only bad thing is they don't stand up well.4/5 Buy it? Yeah, I would."
2,not as thick as it seems like,"The colors on this towel are nice, but it is not as thick as I would have liked it to be (can see light through it when it is held up)."
1,Too many errors,"My son and a friend are in the other room right now, taking the practice test. I'm dreading grading them because you can't trust that the answers in the book are right! Too bad it's too late for me to go out and get 2 different books. Just fyi, here are the mistakes we found (2002 edition)1. Pg. 288, #11 (Answer should be A)2. Pg. 125, top problem (She wrote + then multiplied.)3. Pg. 188, the problem has many typos (Should be (1/(1/x))+1=11"
1,Don't buy this book,"Unless you have never seen an SAT before in your entire life, this book is completely worthless. I bought it mainly for the practical advice I hoped it would contain; I was, however, sorely disappointed. The book is juvenile, uninformative, and riddled with mistakes, especially in the practice tests. The ""tips"" Vlk hands out are dubious at best. I've taken the SAT officially 4 times, and I've taken numerous practice tests over the years, and nothing Vlk says is at all innovative or interesting. Stick with 10 Real SATs"
5,THE BEST BOOK FOR THE SAT's,"This is an absolute MUST for anyone who will be taking the SAT's... its fun and easy to read. I read it the first time in less than 24 hours. Then I read it several more times and memorized parts of it. Her tips and tricks are great when there is ""1 minute to pencils down."" This book not only taught me a thing or two, it calmed my nerves and improved my score almost 200 points. I took the SAT's 4 years ago and I recommend this book to everyone that asks how I got a 1500... Good Luck. Thanks Suzee!"
5,Great resource,"This book was instrumental in allowing my son to succeed in his goals of improving his SAT scores. He told me the book was easy to follow, and the humorous tone made it enjoyable to read, unlike some of the others we have purchased. I highly recommend this book for preparing for the SATs."
2,had to return it,"I got this for Christmas, and was so excited. I am new to juicing, and wanted a compact model that would not take up much counter space. After 30 days though, it began to not turn on when I flipped the switch. Reassembled it many times to no avail. I returned it today and will be looking for another model."
5,Hands Down the BEST!,"After going through about 5-6 juicers including all of the most expensive brands I stumbled upon my L'Equip Mini Pulp Juicer. I simply cannot tell you how good this juicer is! After about 4 years of use (I juice about four times a week), I just ordered a new blade/basket and the juicer is still going strong.I have used it on papaya, pineapple, apple, ginger, carrots, grapefruits, oranges and any other fruit I can get my hands on. While this definitely won't juice leafy greens, you need a masticating juicer for that, this juicer handles fruit/veggies without a hitch.This is one of my favorite products EVER! I can't tell you how many of my friends and relatives have bought this juicer after I make my papaya/pineapple or apple/ginger juice for them. You really cannot beat it.Happy Juicing!"
2,Ok for light juicing,"I purchase the juicer from a health food store for my mother-in-law (i was actually looking for the juiceman II or juicelady) but this was all they had. Basically the pulp is wet and the motor is not as strong as the juiceman II to really get the juice from green vegetables like kale, parslery etc. Even pushing carrots thru requires not to use the plunger to hard because the funnel will slow down. This juicer is ok for the occasional juicing but not for the daily juicing. Also some gritty pulp gets into the juice.eBay Selling Tipswww.TheAuctionGeeks.com"
3,O.K.,Wow....What a pain in the butt to constantly have to wash and use this thing every time you want to juice something. You really cant juice a boat load of stuff and refrigerate......not recommended. Thats not the juicers fault just not good if you want the juice to be fresh. The mesh screen that seperates the juice from the pulp is hard to clean...even in the dish washer. Bottom line ...you have to be willing to use and wash for every juice drink you make....Gets old really quick.
1,get what you pay for,"used once, basket jammed. thought I'd have to return dirty.....finally had to turn the entire machine upside downin the sink and able to push basket off.....not a good juicer"
1,terrible design,"I bought one of these based on the glowing reviews. However, when it arrived, I could not open it up. Most juicers have a clamp that allows you to open the machine for cleaning. This thing was separated by force. I could not pry it apart and knew I would damage it if I continued. There is no way I was going to fight this every day, so I just packed it back up and got my money back."
1,WARNING: DONT BUY!,I bought this juicer after a lot of research and seeing all the good reviews. I ordered a NEW juicer from Amazon and when it came it was broken in many places. The stainless steel mesh was warped and the part that spins was set crooked. Also the bowl with the spout had a deep groove grinded into it like it had been used and broken. I was extremely dissapointed. Item was NOT new and it was very cheap and warped/broken in many places. I am returning today and using a 20% of coupon to BBB and getting a Breville juicer.
4,L'Euip,"Purchased L'Equip. It looks nice. It does its job however, there is a little bit of juice gets left inside of it so you have to lift the juicer and pour whatever is left manually. It only had on/off switch with no speed control. It is hard to juice leaves such as kale. Overall it is not too bad."
4,Juicing Revisited,"My first thought was..this is a MINI machine???? Wow!I gave up juicing in 1990 - cleaning the machine wasn't worth the effort. (A juice stand in Cairo, Egypt was delighted to have it. Can't think why.) So, I see some progress has been made in the ""user friendly"" department. And that's nice. The 110.5 fits the bill. Only a complete slob would find it difficult to clean. But there's still lots of bits & pieces to work on. It's very easy to use, and that's great for me as I have no patience with appliances. I haven't a whole lot to compare it to, but I don't think it will be donated to Goodwill or put in the basement anytime soon. You'll be happy with it. Just a pity there's no recipe book with it."
4,Good almost as much as expected,"The unit is not very noisy, is easy to clean (with the help of a toothbrush on the basket), it is very solid and takes up little space. The yield is quite good, the feeding tube is not too small, and it comes with a 6-year warranty.The design of the top chute is poor: clippings often collect in the chute rather than in the bin, which also lets escape some amount of clippings, due to the gap between the bin and the chute. Use a plastic bag inside the bin and roll it over the chute, to minimize the mess.The juice nozzle lets too much air through, which results in some overspray. The nozzle should really be changed to point down, into the glass. Also, the feeding tube is quite short, and seeds sometimes may fly back out from it, at considerable speed.In all, a very good choice for low volume juicing."
4,easy to clean / great warranty,"I purchased this juicer on clearance at Sams club a couple years ago for less than $25. For the price I paid you can not go wrong with this unit. I am not sure if I would pay $100 for it, so I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5.I do not use the juicer as often as I'd like, but I have had no problems with it. The case & all is very sturdy. I was surprised when I lifted the box at just how heavy the unit is. It is built to last. It also has a 7 year warranty which can't be beat.The juicer is also easy to clean. Yes, it is more difficult than throwing out an empty coke can, but very easy for a juicer."
4,Everything I Expected,"I originally was going to purchase a much pricier juicer (like $300 to $400), but decided since I'm barely beginning to juice that this would be a better alternative. It's definitely lived up to my expectations of it. It's quick, it's not too loud, clean-up is relatively easy. As for the quality of the juice it produces: while there is clearly oxidation, I don't so much mind it. It's not too bad and I know full well, I'm getting what I paid for. It's compact size also makes it easy to store away in a cupboard. I would absolutely recommend this product to a fellow beginning juicer. It also comes with a TEN YEAR WARRANTY. How can you really go wrong?"
4,"Very convenient juicer, but pulp is wetter","I own 3 juicers: Juiceman II, Greenstar 1000, and this juicer.The Greenstar juicer gives better quality juice than this one but is as heavy as a sewing machine and a pain in the neck to clean with 9 parts.This L'Equip Mini juicer is lightweight and compact, and has only 5 parts to clean and juices faster than the Greenstar juicer. One drawback is that the remaining pulp is wetter with this one and not as dry as the Greenstar (which means it doesn't get as much of the juice out of the produce). You might have to run the pulp back into the machine to feel like you got your moneys worth from the veggies. However, the best thing about this juicer is it is very easy, very convenient!"
3,"OK for the money, but wish I didn't buy it","With tools and appliances, it is often cheaper to spend the money up front. I didn't know that I would like juicing, so I figured that this purchase was cheaper than getting a good Omega juicer at first. What I was doing is wasting nearly a hundred dollars. I should have gone directly to the auger based quality juicer and skipped over the centrifugal ones. This is harder to clean than the Omega and you get less yield out of it. Now I'm trying to figure out if I can sell it or give it to someone, because I haven't even turned it on, since I got the Omega."
4,Nice Juicer,"My first juicer, works great so far. Small footprint, easy to clean, pulp ejection into container at back that you can put a plastic bag over so it is easy to remove without washing the container. Feeding tube a little smaller than expected so have to cut apples, cucumbers and other fruits and vegetables before feeding. The spout is a little low so can only take a small glass under it."
4,A juicer to use,It is not a five starBecause it is a juicer and juicer of this style areHARD to cleanHave had it for a bit and have not hadany issues with it other than cleaning it
3,ok juicer,This thing is loud. It does the job as far as juicing and is pretty easy to clean. I prefer using my Omega 8006.
3,An ok juicer,"We bought this juicer after our old Juiceman (purchased at a garage sale) finally pooped out. I think I'm a little sorry I didn't just get another Juiceman. The L'equip is just as noisy as our old juicer was, but it yields far less juice and jams quickly on hard veggies like carrots and beets. This juicer is ok, but it's definitely not for everyday use."
5,My mini juicer,"This product is EXACTLY what I as looking for. I am a first time juicer and it is easy to assemble and take apart for washing. I use it at least 4 times in a week. If you use a bag in the recepticle it makes clean up even easier. I've juice everything from Kale to cucumbers, broccoli, ginger, apples and blueberries and strawberries. Great price for this power house. I'm not into juicing grass and dont need an Omega series juicer (which are pricey)..so I'm happy with this product and it's price point."
2,Just Died!,"We bought this juicer 3 months ago and used it pretty much daily and then it just died on us. We thought maybe it was the plug and switch but nothing luckily we purched it from a chef's store which guarentees all there items & took it back and received our money.Although this was a nice juicer (easy to clean, powerful, no chunks)it should have lasted longer then a couple months."
2,flimsy watch,"This is a nice looking watch. Unfortunately, the band fell apart after fewer than 10 days of wear, and the face scratched pretty badly, even though the watch was only worn for office work. Also, this is a unisex watch, so the face is a little large if you're a smaller woman."
5,A go To reference on North Texas western History,"Mr. Rister wrote this in an easy to read style, and it is loaded with facts, entertainment, a great read which I refer to often. Highest recommendations!!!!"
2,Nice but doesn't fit,"Bought this because of the description and pictures. Got the product and it definite didn't fit my MacBook Air 13, late-2011. I don't think it would fit any MacBook Air 13, it's too big just as others have reported. I contacted the company about this and they did acknowledge the issue saying that the product is defective and that they'll give me my money back, but no offer to replace which seems to indicate they either don't plan to fix it or won't be making one that fits the MBA 13. Too bad because it was one of the nicer designs I've seen."
3,Not a great fit,"I'm a bit puzzled by the reviews that say this sleeve is a ""great fit."" I have a 2011 macbook air 13 and the sleeve is much too big. The sleeve measures 16"" by 12"". The Air is 12.8 x 8.94. The sleeve looks nice and I like the material but all the extra space simply prevents it from slipping inside a briefcase or backpack. Frankly, the sleeve seems huge when you carry it. If size matters, go for something that actually fits."
5,Very Professional,I bought both the box wave leather envelope case and this belkin case and I love both. This case seems to be perfectly tailored-made for the mac book air and so the fit is snug and clean. There is an initial chemical odor but it fades relatively quickly and is to be expected out of most electronic accessories. I wanted this case more to carry around my laptop (safely and discreetly) without a bag or brief- like a portfolio. It looks very professional but I would not limit this case to just businessmen but really anyone. No complaints and highly recommended
3,Not Very Helpful Insight,"If you are looking for a guidebook that packs in lots of information alongside a ton of color pictures, this would be the one. It has an extensive history section and details the features of all of the major hotels and attractions. Take note that it is produced by the Discovery Channel, because it reads much like the channel's documentaries. That is the guide's downfall. While it is tall on info, it is horrible short on critique. It does not rate the hotels, restaurants, or attractions. If you want a really helpful guidebook, with lots of tips and advice, check out ""The Unofficial Guide"". The Insight Guide is a good secondary guidebook through which to read up on general Las Vegas info. Just don't make this one the first or only guide you buy about the city if you really want some insight."
2,Outdated,"I usually don't mind buying older editions of stuff, but this one was just simply too outdated. Most of the stuff in here has changed. It really was not that useful. The book was well written and gave some good insights, you will just want a guidebook that is much more up-to-date."
2,"The Grenadier Band Sounds Best ""Doing Sousa'","London's Weekend Classics 'Sousa Marches' by 'The Band of the Grenadier Guards'compelled me to acquire their CD, The World of the Military Band' They come close to the excellence of the Eastman Wind Ensesmble under Fennel playing Sousa, but are overly loud and brassy on the ...'World of'For Concert/Marching Band preferences...stick to Sousa"
4,Lovely photographs,"This is just a really nice book all around. Besides the beautiful photographs, the layout and glossy pages really make this book a treat to read.The different pictures are held together rather loosely by a short story. While it does help to tie the book together, I found it almost unnecessary. The pictures are enough on their own.After enjoying this book immensely, I went in search of Scalora's other picture book, The Fairies. It too is wonderful to look at, and either book would make a great gift for anyone who is intrigued by the idea of fairies and magic."
3,Beautiful,"I bought this because I loved Scalora's Fairies book and because it has a beautiful photograph on the cover. I think it is the best one in the entire book and is worth purchasing just for that! The other images are nice too. The fonts are craftily and tastefully arranged along with the super glossy pages and super bright colors. I gave it three stars because if you're trying to choose between this book and Scalora's other book, Fairies, then Fairies is the one to purchase since the photographs are even more GORGEOUS. The images in this addition are worth owning too however."
2,"Not worth buying, sorry author","I expected the artwork to be similar to Tom Cross, but this ended up being a bunch of poems that don't even rhyme. Nice pics but the best image is on the cover which is the one we see here on amazon. The rest are not what I expected at all."
4,Intrigue and mystery,"Peter Abrahams books all have one thing in common, they make you want to read them again. (It is kind of like a movie that you want to watch again and again so you can catch the killer when he shows his hand early in the movie.) He has several story lines going at one time and when you get about halfway through the book you are compelled to finish! He is very good at depicting the female characters, even though he is male. I have read all but three books in the last month and I am ravenous for more."
2,It was... meh,"Predictable. If you need some pulp to kills some time, and don't want to pay too much atention to what you are reading, this may be for you."
2,One of Abraham's weaker novels..,"""Revolution 9"" is a convulted story about a Cape Cod fisherman who is running from his past. He falls in love, and is about to be married, when a rogue FBI agent contacts him to find a person from his past. Reluctantly, he agrees, and he then has to deal with his guilt over a bombing that killed a nine year-old boy. Various characters are interweaved, and some of them die a little too convineatly. The climax is where Charlie has to rescue his fiance from a psychopath that wants revenge while keeping an eye on a nasty female cohort of his."
4,Something missing in Steamroller?,I love JT. But I would like to know if the expletive has been deleted somewhat in Steamroller? I have checked at leat 3 CDs in my country (imported though) and there is this irritating deletion from one of my favourite tracks. Any one can confirm this?
4,The Best of the Best of James Taylor's Greatest Hits.,"If you are not a fan, this is a great album to have. It is the essential James Taylor, as far as hits are concerned. If you are a fan, and I am, and love his deep album cuts as well as the hits, you probably have the songs on previously released products. In that case, the only reason to have this version...I got it as a gift...is to have one for the house, one for the car, one for the walkman,etc. If you spend your own money for it, you need help with your addition. However, it's a soft, easy way to go."
3,Good collection but...,"...""Something In The Way She Moves"" and ""Country Road"" are not the same versions as on the original JT's Greatest Hits from '76, which I prefer. If I were to do a one-disc comp, I would have included ""Never Die Young"" and ""Copperline"" (they could have dispensed with the live ""Steamroller Blues"" for one of those tracks.) And, the closing, newly-recorded ""Bittersweet"" is okay, but sounds like a leftover track that he decided to stick on this collection because it didn't really fit anywhere else. But, those complaints aside, this is still a good overall compilation with really nice sound quality."
4,Mellow and timeless,"A mellow, timeless collection of some of my favorite James Taylor songs and a few I never heard before...this was my first time purchasing a James Taylor CD (album in my day) and this CD has a nice collection of songs from folk to blues to ""folksey"" R&B."
4,james taylor-best of,I bought James Taylor and Carol King Tapestry.I have been watching in stores so when I saw them on Amazon I also ordered Moody Blue and Cat Stevens. Amazon has become my number one place to find the greats of yesteryears!
5,Really enjoyed this cd,"I was not a big fan of JT, but i am now,,,,it is a nice cd to put on when you want to relax and take life easy."
1,edited for 16 and under,"Steam roller blues not the original version.Warning for music purists this has been edited I would assume so no warning lable has to be put on it.Chicken choking, Mother ???ing.The big finish of this song now ends with a wimper."
2,a couple of hit numbers,"I bought this thinking that it was good romantic music after listening to you've got a friend ... and How sweet it is .., but the rest can put you to sleep. I do listen to the likes of John Denver etc. in this genre, but this was just OK...bear in mind that this will sound and seem completely different if you are already a james taylor fan"
1,Overrated Camp Music,"I find James Taylor to be such a boring and overrated artist -- truly homogenized. When I listen to these songs, I am reminded of all the kids at camp that used to play his music. They thought they were real cool cause they listened to him, but they weren't. I guess today, those people's kids listen to Norah Jones at camp, and think they are cool. See how it continues."
4,Nice memories,Who could hate James Taylor? His tender voice is light and lyrical and it takes me back to sweet summer memories. It's nice to listen when you want to be in a peaceful state of mind.
3,It is Ok but not complete,The problem with best of's is that is mostly not complete! There is missing 1 - 2 important songs
2,forever to ship,"First, it took 3 weeks to get the item. Wanted the cd for mothers day. Ordered on the 5th of may, received the item on the the 21st. Quality was below average. Do not buy."
3,Discovery,"I have just discovered the many things James Taylor writes and sings about. I got this album to get a copy of ""How Sweet It Is"" and found several other songs I like almost as much."
4,Better Sound for Early Tracks,"In response to the person who asked if this CD has been remastered, the answer is yes. Almost all of the tracks sound light years better than the older ""Greatest Hits"" release, especially the earler stuff. The sound is clear, relatively hiss-free, and sport a warmth that is sorely missing from the ancient Warner masterings of the early albums. In direct comparison to ""Classic Songs"" the import Cd that was remastered in the late 80's, the tracks pack considerably more punch. ""Country Road"" is the much less common single version and is a completely different take than the album version. I think it's nice to have, myself. ""Something"" would have been better served by the 1976 remake. The live ""Steamroller"" has been edited (a certain phrase uttered by JT at the very end has been scrambed). The Columbia tracks sound better on the respective CDs they come from, as well as on the ""Greatest Hits Vol 2""."
4,A Little Too Tame,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NJL7AA/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis seems to be one of Barbara Mertz's earlier books, although by the time she wrote this one she was able to begin to move away from the Gothic stereotype that was so popular at that time. She did have many of its standards: the innocent young girl lured into a trap, the old, frightening house, the good guy who seemed like a bad guy and the bad guy who seemed like a good guy, but the ""other woman"" who is always so spiteful and hateful was conspicuous by her absence, and the only deaths were those to be expected by everyone, including those who were dying.I doubt I will read this book again, as I do with most of her Elizabeth Peters and Barbara Michaels books, but it was worth buying and reading once."
1,Did anyone else notice?,"The character of Bagstock changed names two pages after he was introduced and was called Bagshot throughout the rest of the book. At the very least, that's a red flag for me and I should have put the book down then, wondering if the book's editor ever woke up. Apparently, said editor was asleep through most of the task...this is a tediously written book. The only good thing I can say about the experience is at least I didn't pay full price for it. I couldn't even finish it, it was so bad, although I skimmed the last half to see if it ever picked up. It didn't."
3,Not her best effort,"This is one of my favorite authors, whether as Barbara Michaels or Elizabeth Peters, but this is the worst book of hers that I have ever read. Set in Victorian Europe, beautiful Marianne suddenly finds herself without a family, home, or money. She moves to London and quickly finds herself a job singing, but she is too naive to realize it is in a ""gentlemen's club."" Things don't work out there and she then, in an unbelieveable turn of events, suddenly finds herself living in the lap of luxury because a rich duchess believes Marianne is the long, lost daughter of a famous spiritualist. Can Marianne communicate with him? Is he really dead? Is she really his daughter?"
1,Just the worst Barbara Michaels' novel,I have read about 8 of this author's books. Just about all have kept me totally engrossed and expected the same reaction to The Wizard's Daughter. BUT it is totally banal - I just could not believe it was by the same author. Totally unbelievable plot and insipid heroine.
4,Highly entertaining mystery.,Ms. Michaels combined a damsel in distress story with a who done it and kept me guessing until the end
3,Beyond Believability,"Charlie Willis is back in another TV mystery, this time about the misadventures of a new network attempting to revive a Star Trek-like show from the sixties, called Beyond the Beyond, and a rogue talent agency. Charlie, now a security chief for his old studio, is assigned to protect a studio writer who is being threatened by the talent agency who wants to sign him.Things get waaaaay out of hand when the actor who once played Beyond the Beyond's Captain, now a psychotic recluse, orders his fans to kill the new cast. In order to figure out what's going on, Charlie has to go undercover as the NEW captain in order to draw out the assassins.This is an amusing farce and I read the whole book in a single sitting, but I can understand why Goldberg didn't keep writing about this cast of characters - there's only so much about TV you can make fun of...it's already a joke."
4,"Beam me up, Goldberg","Being a loner as a child, TV was my best friend. TV offered me that wacky neighbor, best friend, and girlfriend. When I needed a parent to give me the ""talk,"" TV was there. TV took me to faraway places without leaving my living room. TV was always there for me. With that said, this book was a joy to read. TV writer/producer Lee Goldberg offers a nice mix of the private eye novel and a satire on the TV industry. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes TV and/or a good read. If you like this book, you will also like any other books by Goldberg."
5,What a Treat!,"I'm amazed that I'm the first to write a review of ""Habit"", by William James. Many of the James editions are actually so inexpensive, I consider them ""Thank You's' from Kindle for just being a subscriber. I write this review for having learned so much about mental habits, how they influence our lives for better or worse, how they originate and how to go about altering bad habits, and how to develop better ones. O.k., so the title tells you this already, but you can have the audio on Kindle recite it to you as you walk your dog. Don't yet have a dog? You can still always get one! You can call him 'William' or ' James' and walk him as you listen to this fine book."
1,Clay Bakers,"I recently ordered 2 clay bakers through Amazon, both arrived here in pieces. Sending such products through regular mail is a big mistake. Won't try that again. Very disappointed as I enjoyed and appreciated my previous clay bakers."
4,Great CD!,"Some of you out there might remember Mama's Boys from back in the mid 80's. They had some hits on MTV with songs like ""If The Kids Are United"" and their version of ""Mama We're all Crazy Now"". They are a group of 3 very talented brothers from Ireland (Pat, Tom, and John McManus) who have put together some great songs. My favorite songs on the ""Plug It In"" CD are ""Runaway Dreams"", ""Straight Forward"", and ""In the Heat of the Night"". I'm not sure what this group is up to these days, but I highly recommend this CD for anyone out there who likes some great metal and hard rock that gets you moving!"
3,Sweet and endearing,"Great actors, wonderful storyline; A bit lackluster but that is not the actors fault. Worth the watch, especially when there is nothing else on."
1,Not manufactured to spec.,Installed on my 400e and 1 side was rubbing on the caliper. Had to buy more expensive parts from mechanic to get job done on time.As always amazin customer service was awsome. Refunded right away.
4,CIA and More,The character of Mariah Bolt as a CIA Operative is exciting and interesting. The story of her involvement in trying to find out what happened to her husband and daughter takes her into a web of a variety of places and people. It was an exciting read.
5,Very Cool Thriller,"Loved the CIA info -- and definitely written by someone who knows that world well. Excellent first book -- i read it years ago, went back and read it again after reading more of Taylor's novels. Intelligent, tight, wonderful -"
2,Only Academic Historians Could Make Cuba this Boring!,"I used this book in a Cuban history course that I taught last year, and man did the students hate it. This collection of 4 articles from the multi-volume Cambridge History of Latin America is meant to provide a concise overview of Cuban history. But they begin in the 1600s, missing the first several hundred years, and end in the 1970s, missing the last two pivotal decades. The articles themselves are informative enough, but so boring and poorly written as to make the reader weep. This is an awful book."
4,Revisiting the magnetic fields,"This band has always had a prominent place in my CD collection but was often just an occasional guest in the actual CD player...until just recently. Not sure if my taste in music has changed or if I just didn't take the time to really listen before, but I'm so glad that the lack of play didn't ever convince me to trade my magnetic fields CD's off for something else fleeting. Get Lost has definitely gone from being a set of single tracks that I flip between to an essential album for me."
4,the usual assortment of excellent stuff....,"not quite as dark, and therefore not quite as affecting, as ""the charm of the highway strip"", ""get lost"" is still a worthy release that needs to be heard. there are some jaw-dropping moments of brilliance (""why i cry"", ""love is lighter than air"", ""the dreaming moon""), but there are also a couple of sub-par (for stephin merritt, at least) tunes such as ""don't look away"" and the forced, overly-cutesy ""famous"". but these are minor complaints: you really can't go wrong with the magnetic fields -- they make truly fantastic records. get 'em all!"
1,I'm sorry?,"I don't want to put a long review and have all the MF fans bash on me so I'll just say this music is not for me, the end."
4,I got started from a cover,"I was listening to this on a whim and when ""Why I cry"" came on I had to have it!!! If you havent heard it covered, look for a cd under the name All-Time Quarterback where ""Why I Cry"" is covered by Ben Gibbard (Ben, the guy who did ATQ as a side project, sings for Death Cab for Cutie and The Postal Service)!!! Anything that Ben covers must be GREAT!So I got this cd... what fun!!! Its good to hear honest lyrics and some innovative instrument arrangements!"
5,wonderful images of gay community life,"Funny, tender and raucous, this author's work deserves to be celebrated. Find and read a used copy if you can. As Scott McCloud says of comics in general, most of the emotion is between the panels-- the evocative nature of the medium bears charming fruit here."
4,Good mystery!,"I usually have an idea of who the culprit is in mystery stories. In Honky Tonk Kat I had not a clue. There were so many different suspects I just could not pick one person to focas my attention on. The part I enjoyed most about this book was the flashbacks. Overall this was a very gripping mystery. The only reason why I didn't get a whole full five stars was because some of the family history part was very hard to keep straight. But, overall a very good mystery and worth taking a look at. Even if you are not intrested in country music. A fun read!"
4,"A fun, easy read.","This was my first Karen Kijewski book, and I really enjoyed it. Fun, realistic characters - and you are kept wondering who the culprit is. It makes me want to read more of her books. If you're looking for something to change your life, this isn't it. It's just fun to read."
2,Disappointing,"I've heard different performances of these pieces by the same artists and found many of the selections to be highly eccentric renditions. Ella Fitzgerald's ""How High the Moon"" was technically very accomplished but particularly bizzare, almost insulting the audience at some points. On several pieces, it's as if the musicians were doing the tune for the 10,000th time and were torturing it or turning it inside out just to be doing it differently from every other time they'd played it. Perhaps that's why the editors selected these performances. I was quite disappointed overall."
5,Excellent Read,"I was looking for a book to help me understand how regular performance testing is performed so that I could construct a plan to do Denial of Service security testing. I knew nothing about performance testing at all. The books really well laid out, structured, has great examples and is really methodical. It was perfect !"
5,"Formerly speechless, but now able to express my appreciation","This is perhaps the most incredible ska(core?) album ever produced. The song ""Electric"" shall forever remain my all time favorite. Concerning one of the previous reviews from 1999 where an ignorant fan said the same thing 16 times in a row, I would sharply disagree and have to say that this CD does NOT in fact need ""Jolene."" I found Songs From Suburbia to be a startling disappointment, followed by the band splitting up. Static World View is fantastic from start to finish, both musically and lyrically. I still find myself to be in a state of disbelief every time I hear it. It's just amazing, I bought it twice over the span of a few years, nothing else to say."
2,This cd needs Jolene.,This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene. This cd needs Jolene.
5,Fashion and beauty in photography,"This is a Great book. Good size, hardcover, well desinged in and out. this book has tons of great photographs. Many famous models and actresses inside. If you love art, photography and beautyful women get this. The work is by top-notch photographers."
2,"Nice Design, BUT VERY FLIMSY","The price was right....or shall I say, I got what I paid for! I love the look of the curtain rods, the color selection, and even the bracket. BUT, that's as far as it goes! The curtain rods are not held in place with any screws, so every time we attempt to move the curtains open (or close), the rods slide, thus coming apart. My husband pulled to hard, and the bracket broke! Now, I am on the hunt for a sturdier double bracket to match the color of my curtain rods. A last note: Skip this one....NOT WORTH IT!"
1,Buyer beware!,"I purchased these curtain rods. They're pretty, but the rod holders are JUNK. They have a swirl type holder that holds the rods in place. When installing, I tightened the screw to hold the rod and the little swirl snapped right off. I ended up taking it in for an exchange. Big mistake..I should have returned them. Today I decided to wash my curtains and while hanging them back up, another snapped just by bending the rod down a little too far. If I were considering buying these, I would want someone to tell me...these rod holders are cheap and break very easy. I would look for something sturdier. Wait, I AM looking for something sturdier..."
3,Picture deceiving,There was no measurement that I saw for the balls/filials on the end of the rod. They were much smaller than I expected and do not have any visual impact. The champagne color was the closest I could get to my brushed nickel fixtures.
2,Les is not more,Sorry to say this one's a sleeper. Less than 30 minutes of slow two dimensional arrangements. Mary Ford can only be heard on muffled background chorus harmony. Save your money and be delighted with Guitar Legends or the like.
5,Collins Bible Handbook is an excellent tool for teaching!,"The Collins Bible Handbook is a wonderful way to introduce each book of the Bible. With summary text, pictures, and scripture, one open page gives the student a quick and precise over view of that Book. I first used it in 1990 while teaching an Old Testament class of 10th graders, and I still find the book valuable now that I am teaching middle school students."
5,Houseplants Thriving!,"Thank you, Thank you Julie Bawden~Davis! My family no longer calls our houseplants ""three month plants"". They used to be named that because the only plant I could keep alive longer than three months was a sturdy pathos. I've taken your book with me on my gardening shopping trips and used it as a resource to ensure that I am choosing the right plant for the right location in my home. Suddenly, with your guidance, my plants are surviving and even thriving. I've even referenced it for my patio plantings. My gardening attempts are no longer a ""Folly"" thanks to your concise book."
2,Los Hombres Malo,"Unfortunately, Los Hombres follows in the same footsteps as the Playin to Win and In The Eye Of The Storm CD releases from Magic records. It's sound quality is very poor. In fact, this could possibly be the poorest sound quality I have ever heard on a CD. The four bonus tracks are titled radio remixes and do resemble a cleaner mix. However, the original 9 tracks ar very scratchy sounding and my guess is that an album was used as the source for the recording. Outlaw fans, if you are looking for the same quality of sound as the Outlaws, Lady In Waiting, and Hurry Sundown titles, forget it. This is not even close. If you plan on playng this out of a cheap boom box, then you probably won't notice the difference. Hopefully, Arista records will someday give Los Hombres Malo the proper release it deserves from the original master tapes."
1,Las Canciones Son Malas,"I'm not sure what's worse: The CD sound quality or the songs themselves. I'll give it to the songs - at least you'll remember the wretched CD sound quality; the songs are formulaic and forgettable. Whatever spark of creativity the Outlaws rediscovered on their previous release (Ghost Riders) had abandoned them for this effort.One wonders how ""Running"" and ""Easy Does It"" (the only tracks here that are even vaguely interesting) might have sounded in the hands of the original band."
3,WAR IS HELL,"DEATHWATCH scores big points on its talented cast, especially Jamie Bell, Hans Matheson, Hugo Speer and Andy Sarkis. It is also heavy on atmospheric impressions, and has an original premise. However, it is layered with such ambiguity that by the time the movie comes to an end, we're not sure what we've just witnessed. Why is the trench such a negative force, that compels the men to turn on each other? What is it with the final sequence in which Shakespeare realizes that all of them are dead? Does Shakespeare escape? What is it with the German soldier and the final scene? This is another one of those ""artistic"" ventures that relies heavily on its style and asks the audience to forego a credible, cohesive plot. Although it's above average for other genre films, it ultimately fails because it doesn't have a payoff to satisfy this viewer."
4,The First Great War Horror Movie,Yeah DEATHWATCH is an evil movie.It's bad enough fighting the huns in the muddy rat infested trenches of 1917 besides having to worry about what lurks in an abandoned German trench in no mansland.A must see for any GREAT WAR enthusiast who also likes horror movies
4,"Whoa, sleeper flick that's better than you'd expect...","Given that this is a virtually unknown film, I believe it was released in 2002, this is a good watch. Excellent sets and backdrops filmed on location in Prague really portrayed the misery of trench warfare during WWI. Add a creepy twist and the product is this very decent psychological thriller that delivers a wholloping, yet subtle at the same time, visual trip and ending. If you're looking for an easy to understand plot or lots of mindless action, look elsewhere. If you're in the mood for something that makes you think, just a little, and don't mind being spooked a bit, ""Deathwatch"" is for you. Hats off to the team that put this original ride together, well done and recommended."
3,Surprisingly good,"What a wonderfully produced film. I watched it only 'cause I was sick home for the day, and expected just another lousy slasher flick. That's not this film at all.The music is wonderful, the set design establishes a dreary mood of war in the trenches, and the acting is really quite good.What I liked best is that this movie can be viewed in so many different ways _ horror film, ghost story, political metaphor. I have no idea what the writer had in mind putting this screenplay together, but sometimes the most seemingly simple stories can be the most complex. This is a good film."
2,Too Dark and Gloomy for me,The Deathwatch should be called HardtoWatch. Some may enjoy but if you want to be depressed save time and money on this and just pay some bills.
2,dont look for any fun in this trench...you wont find much,"There's something out there in the trenches as a group of soldiers are subjected to a horrific evil thats brewing within and taking them out one by one. Now, they gotta stay alive if they dont kill each other in the process. Very interesting story doesnt quite add up to the fullest extent, though there are some good and bad moments. Jamie Bell (Billy Elliott), Hugh O'Connor and Andy Serkis (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy), who goes very nutso here, are part of the cast that get lost in the trenches. Dont find this to be the most spectacular movie you ever saw. Find this movie to be at least some what of a bore. Though the end was kind of boosted it up a star."
2,Didn't really like it much,"I didn't like this movie too much. First of all, I'm not really into horror movies, I guess the only reason it interested me is because it reminded me of the computer game ""Call of Duty"" that I played not too long ago. I found the movie kind of boring, and just didn't entertain me too much. I don't think my opinion means too much on this movie, because like I said, I don't like horror movies much."
2,Soldiers,"I was hoping for more from this, but didn't get it. You would have to realize that what you see isn't always what is truly happening. It altered realities. Some of it didn't make much sense, but the end brought it together. Peace and compassion were the ultimate goal, yet it did everything in opposite respect to what they wanted to achieve. That part of the story was good, but that's about all I can recommend of it. Just wasn't for a hard core horror fan, so if you like the lighter side this is perfect for you."
3,In a white room,"O K flick for a $1 rental, but not one for the libary. Great production with a strong group of actors. The story was alright, yet gave a bad flavor. I like Army style movies for the most part unless its an Army movie where everyone starts turning on each other under the same tired hollywood dogma. I. E. Strong, but weak sergent. Officer is a pampered brat with rank. The christion solder starts 2go crazy and is worst then the enemy. The most hight skilled solder goes psyco because he just loves 2kill. If thats your cup of tea then this movie about a group of WW2 british solders faceing evil(?) is the movie for you. Its ok and doesn't have that college film class progect feel. I give it a great for a $1 rent review. ;-)"
2,A little too much hype maybe,"Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie. It's actually fairly decent. Nothing to write home about, though. The directing, the editing, the acting, the script, all equally adequate. If any one of these individual pieces had shone a little brighter, it would have gained another star, but it just didn't really grab me."
4,"Harkens Back to Horror TV series ""Night Gallery""","""Deathwatch"" was a very interesting film that is more on the style of the horror T.V. series ""Night Gallery"", than a typical gore film.However, that being said, many people who are fans of horror without being fans of strictly gore, will enjoy this film.Personally, I found this film to be enjoyable, and a nice period piece as well as a horror/suspense film.My 4 star rating was given as I feel that to be classed as a genuine theatrical release""horror"" film,a little more zombie action was needed."
4,"better than 3 stars, but not 5","I think this movie was very good, I didn't give it 5 stars because I would have liked to seen a tad bit more of the barbed wire zombies (action sequences) but it did have some bloodshed....the movie plays out like an episode of the twilight zone, very good! Oh and to the other dorks, whats your deffinition of horror? War is the most Horrifying thing in the world, then to add ghost into it?"
4,Great to have this available again,"It wasn't immediately apparent to me that it is a big sonic upgrade over the ""Echoes"" CD, but no matter. This is an excellent album from the ex-Byrd and is essential for fans of the group or of Gene's later solo masterpieces such as ""White Light,"" ""Roadmaster,"" and ""No Other."" The liner notes and booklet layout are also better and more informative than was ""Echoes."""
5,"Wow, I'm confused?!","The guy who bought this and gave it 2 stars got ""White Light"" first and that's why he doesn't care for this? Gimme a break! He should love this 'cos that lp is lame for the most part and this one builds on the pretty great first Byrds lp (not Turn, Turn, Turn though which was mostly a re-tread of the the first lp and not very good 'cept for the Pete Seeger lift of the title track) to create a GREAT piece of work. Go figure!?"
5,Between The Pink,"On this I can hear the birth of the strange space ""Between The Buttons"", ""John Wesley Harding"" and ""Music From Big Pink"". Gene Clark was so far ahead of his time he never caught up. ESSENTIAL"
2,underwhelming,"I have listened to Gene Clark since he emerged in the Byrds - he is a great musician. However, this album sounds more like a combination of the Beatles & the Monkees.I was very disappointed given the musicians who participated. Go to Dillard & Clark for his best stuff!"
2,Oh Well,"I love Gene Clark. The early Byrds stuff is beyond extrordinary, but as hard as I try I can't get into his post-Byrds stuff. My big mistake was that I bought White Light right our of the chute as my introduction to Gene's solo stuff and White Light is a fantastic listen, and his voice is so sweet and his writing so full of feeling on that one. Since then I have purchased No Other, the Gosdin stuff, and Dillard stuff. It just all seems disjointed and like their was never any real direction to any of the compositions. This Gosdin Brothers outing is simply no better than any of the other stuff. I have never understood the hoopla over No Other, so maybe it is just me. It is also the fact that much of what is here is dated sounding and that hurts the effect of it all. I will always think that Clark could have been so much more, but simply fell prey to his own demons and it is a shame that he couldn't have kept pumping out the type of stuff that he did on White Light."
4,"Good for light compounding, low luster","Don't use this to take out light scratches and the things you would normally use heavy compound on, despite what the description says. It does a good job with scuffs and light oxidation, and leaves a low to medium luster shine. This was accomplished with a buffer, and I wouldn't recommend doing this by hand."
4,Great Stuff,"Easy to apply and remove and does an excellent job of bringing back the gelcoats shine. O used a orbital buffer and paint brush to apply and removed it with microfiber cloth.To apply just paint 4 X's of the restorer using a paint brush in a 2x2 area, place the buffer on one of the X's turn it on and work the area. move to new area repet process. Buff with microfiber cloth and enjoy.This one bottle did my 27' Triton WA top to bottom using this method."
5,Great suff,I used this on my moderately oxidized fifth-wheel and it cleaned it up very nice. It is somewhat abrasive so don't use it on paint or decals...
1,Doesnt last,"Probably wont spend any money on this wax again, seems lackluster and didnt last long. Tried another brand and the results were far better. Asked other boaters for brands they used and no one recommended this wax. One and done."
3,They don't build them like they used to,It is hard to find a conventional phone in this style today. The quality is adequate. The design is not as practical as the older phones. Placement of the cord connection is poor. The bulky base seems to have no reason.
2,Not for wall mounting!,"This seems to be a great phone, however the handset falls off the base when you try to mount it vertically on a wall jack. There is no ""lip"" to keep the handset on the base...it is not possible to mount this on the wall!!!"
1,Avoid.,"I expected at least a bit of useful information from this book.. and it was totally useless to me. The author spent the all but a few lines merely summarizing modern metaphysical practice and his opinions on the matter. When he did finally get to the point of the book, it was pitiful."
1,what the...,"i did not enjoy this book.it takes a Very Simple technique, and adds a whole bunch of useless fluff to it, without giving much explanation of theories, or even any new ideas on ""gnosis""."
2,Disappointing,"I picked up a copy of this book because I was looking for another method of working magick and I`ve had an interest in sigils for awhile now. When I read this book I was highly disappointed with how the author basically says that anyone who believes in Karma or some other type of fate is just wrong. The author never gives a logical reason as to why he thinks the philosophy of Karma is wrong, but rather just says it`s wrong. The author also has a tendency to ramble on and on about how magick is created from the subconscious rather than mentioning at all the other idea of sending out energy to the universe to cause change in your life. I give this book 2 stars because if you have no knowledge of sigils at all you may find some useful information here. However, if you do have knowledge of sigils or if you are part of a religion that believes in Karma I wouldn`t waste my money on this book. You`ll just get angry with the author and want to throw this bok out the window."
1,"wordy, pushy with beliefs, and not well explained","I bought this book at a local shop today, and I have to say, I wish I had checked out the ratings here first.Phillip Cooper takes 40 or so pages just to get to talking about sigils. Prior to that, he tells you how to think and what to believe to make sigils work, while interjecting at regular intervals how stupid the belief in karma, reincarnation, and other things he does not ascribe to, are.This book told me a little about magic in general, and in that regard it was slightly helpfull, if only for giving me other topics to research. But the negatives outweight the positives in the book so much IMO, that it is not worth considering.If I can find the reciept for the book, Im returning it. But if I cant, like another reviewer said, it will be one of the few books Ive ever thrown out."
2,Better books are available,"The title sums it up.Bought it months ago.Did not find it worth finishing.Yes,there are worse books out there.But,better are available.What disgusts me is the current price asked by sellers."
2,Not so great,"The problem with most truths are that they are so plain Jayne simple, they by-pass our focus completely because as human beings we need stimulation to grab our attention and truth doesn't stand up to the fancy of (dare I say) drivel. However, this book isn't crap, it's just not good. Like many books, it starts off good but ends with dross. Honestly the basics of sigil enchantment (as I like to call it) could be presented on one 8 x 14 1/2 piece of paper. A book of this magnitude fails because it falls into a few traps such as a new approach to power and how everything previously presented and different ain't the way yet it includes such formulas albeit altered to bring acceptance by a synthesis and thus the contradictions commence.The book can serve as a launch pad to a few key things by honestly, I feel that there are better books on the subject."
5,Excellent!,"This isn't your typical happy-go-lucky teenage novel about friendships. It explores how Laurie and Soap, two best friends, learn to live with the unwelcome changes of growing up and maturing. Through a series of trials which test the limit of their friendship, Laurie must decide if the sacrifices of being Soap's friend are worth it . At the end of the novel, both girls find some sense of peace and an understanding of the power of friendship"
4,Great yet bulky,"Just purchased one of these after returning the similar device from Tascam. Has a lot of great sounds, some of which I wish I could use on stage. This unit plays all of my CD & CD-R without any issues. The unit is larger than I expected. Just a little smaller than a shoe box. Is A/C only so forget about practice away from an outlet plug. This is no problem for me since I only pactice at home. Feel the product was worth the money. Had it for a month and still satisfied."
1,Misleading Title,"For those customers who are buying other books, such as The Deep Dark, that deal specifically with the Sunshine Mine fire or with other mine disasters, Amazon inappropriately ""suggests"" The Sunshine Mine Disaster for purchase. I, for one, was looking for serious history, not a collection of poetry. Let this serve as a warning to prospective buyers. Shame on Amazon for conflating these poems with nonfiction works based on painstaking research into a great and terrible tragedy."
2,Poor Quality Filter,"Though I didn't use either of the two filters I ordered and subsequently returned, I had tried this product before and found it lacking in filtration. There was a charcoal taste in the drinking water. I have since bought a better, though more expensive filter and now enjoy fresh tasting water."
4,In the old fashioned way,"Based on SUMMERTIME, the David Lean classic with Katharine Hepburn and Rossano Brazzi, this musical will delight audiences addicted to conventional, old fashioned, well-crafted pieces. Ít's not a great piece of music but enjoyable enough to listen more than once."
3,You always will hear a waltz from Richard Rodgers,"An example of Rodgers trying to fit in a new contributor of lyrics, but the match wasn't there, yet even so, his melodic mastery shone through."
2,Just a Warning,"If you are like me and thinking of getting this only because you are a fan of Sergio Franchi, then be careful. He sings to his usual standard but his songs are few and not particularly tuneful. Also avoid this if you dislike shrieky whiny 'Broadway' style singing. I cannot comment on the quality or not of these songs because the aformentioned type of singing and overly 'talky' Soundheim style lyrics ain't my personal bag."
1,Not as good as the orginal,"I had the older model of this sander for many years and was very happy with it. The only problem I ever had with the old model was keeping the dust collector attached. The 343 improved that weak point, however I just found out that they changed the bearing retainer to plastic. I sanded for about one hour yesterday, lifted the sander, and the pad remained on the bench. Heat had softened the bearing retainer and allowed the pad screws to fall out. Not happy with Porter-Cable's latest attempt to save money."
3,Variable speed orbit sander,"This is a good finishing sander, and I love the variable speed feature. My old porter-cable type 4 single speed does a better job of the heavy sanding. So I use it to do the tough sanding and this one to do the finishing. I have used Dewalt and it seems to be about the same. I think it could have been designed a little different on the top where you hold it. Not good for small hands."
4,Porter Cable 343 VSK RO sander,"Porter-Cable 343VSK 5-Inch Variable Speed Random Orbit Sander - Hook & Loop PadAfter many years of hard service I replaced my trusty old DeWalt 5"" RO sander with a new Porter Cable 343VS. To-date I'm very pleased with the PC's performance. Aside from a couple of features the DeWalt lacked (vacuum hose attachments, bayonet-fit on dust collector, self-stopping) there is very little difference.I bought the PC for its vacuum hose capability, and I bought PC's 1"" flex hose kit. It will be useful when (if ever) I locate an adapter for my 2"" dust collector's LOCK LINE hose."
1,Wouldn't buy this one again,"The screws that attach the pad base to the unit screw into plastic. Eventually these will strip out due to heat and vibration. These should be machine screws instead. If I can't find parts, this thing is going in the garbage.The variable speed is pointless. When turned down below the highest setting it is just about impossible to use the sander. It jumps all over the place and you can't get a consistent finish.The dust collector doesn't do much either."
1,Clunky,"Very heavy and clunky, like a very old model. Watch band fell apart quickly. It's in my junk drawer now."
3,ray ray,"I got this watch about a month ago. I do like the day/date display and the hour/minute hands glow in the dark. Only 2 negative things I can say is the clasp is easy to undo but it is hard to close and, although it is 2 tone, there is allot of gold on it (the face is encased in gold)."
2,"Not so ""Complete""","I was very disappointed by this book. From the title ""Complete Book of..."" I expected there to be a wealth of information in it. Instead it is a breezy, slick, highly illustrated, briefest of introductions to some major Jewish rituals and festivals. The illustrations are nice and the text is pleasant. I am surprised it is not in a larger format -- the content is more along the lines of a coffee-table picture book. If you are looking for a pleasant overview survey in an attractive format, this is the book for you. If you are looking for anything ""complete"", look elsewhere."
1,Waste of money,"The lemon has to be cut in small pieces and the product is to flimsy to get a proper squeeze, but it looks good."
3,Wished it were longer,"I think it's always fun when the author brings the characters forward in time, like a nice jump by decades and then has them interacting with some of the same folks from all those years ago. S. Michael does that but we don't get the full enjoyment of the old persons revisited, i was wishing for that once the story propelled into the future. It's still a good story that has some new ideas (that work!). The pace was a little fast for my taste as i kept wishing for even more background on the characters that i liked, mainly Ethan and Julia. Also, what was Raina doing for three hundred years i'd like to know? It's a nice rainy day read, i just wished it were twice as long."
5,"Exhaustive, Intriguing, and Well researched","I recently used this book for an indepedent study on Canopy Ecology and found it abosutley indispensible. Lowman and Nadkarni used the work of such big name scientists as Nigel Stork and Terry Erwin to assemble an array of canopy topics including access, structure, nutrient cycling, species compossition, epihyte and hemiephyte ecology, and even ethnobotany. Each chapter is clear cut and informative and the book does not waste space with cheesy fru-fru. Of particular interest to the aspiring canopy researcher is the suggestions for new avenues of research given at the end of almost every chapter."
5,A great canopy primer!,"One of best synopsis of the current to near current canopy research topics, struggles, and future agendas! Lowman and Nadkarni continue to out do themselves with this suberbly edited book. Highly recommended for anyone interested in forest ecology and forest canopies who aren't afraid to look at some graphs. You'll learn something...."
5,Excellent ..............!,"Excellent record, great music : no other comment needs to be added .....Yes, just fantastic, sweet and soft, easy on the ear ............................."
3,Sized too small,This kids shirt is beautiful but the sizes are not accurate! I ordered a Childs size 6 but it's really for a 2 yr old! Had to send it back for the right size. If it's for a 4 yr old order at least a size 6-8!
4,Great music...,"As a french jazz fan and drummer I think that Lewis Nash is one of the masters of jazz drumming, his musical contribution to the today jazz is very important.This album is a marvelous exemple of swing and musicality, what a great sound and a great feeling....Thanks to make the Jazz lives..."
2,Not what was expected,Only basic info on planning a project and included plans are just a teaser to get you to purchase complete plans. There are much better general barn/shed books.
3,not necessarily what the cover says...,"The cover bills it as 'complete' plans for 12 different barns- actually, to get complete plans that would be needed to get building permit do construction or buy materials, you have to order a set form the authors website. The book has nice practical ideas about working with subcontactors, and the designs and sources are quite useful."
4,Great Disc,"This lite up disc is very nice. Very easy to fly. Good battery life, easy to switch on and off. Seems easier to fly forehanded with this disc than a regular 175g."
4,Very good frisbee,"The frisbee is very great! It has a bright LED light, looks nice and it was a gift to my friend who loved ultimate frisbee and he loved it!A few drawbacks of the product is its not the standard weight of a regular frisbee, its more heavy, but im guessing thats from the battery."
4,"Best Product on the Market, Unfortunately","I play Ultimate all year round, and we have no access to lights in the winter. We've tried multiple different solutions, but this LED disc is the best thing we've found. It flies OK, but it is noticeably inferior to the Ultrastar disc which is typically used for Ultimate. Unfortunately, Ultrastar's glow in the dark offering just doesn't do the job for two hours of playing at night, so this is the best option.The disc itself isn't particularly durable. A friend of mine bought one two years ago, and when it went bad I bought one last year. I had to buy a new one this year. They seem to be a little sensitive to moisture (not surprising), but the problem is that the ground is typically wet during the winter, and it seems to just wear down pretty quickly. All in all it's worth the price, but I wish there were a better option out there somewhere."
5,Perfect,"Love this light-up disc, and you definitely can't beat the price! A must have for late night throwing in the yard."
2,The product itself is great but the packaging leaves something to be desired.,"It was disappointing to find out that the battery on the flashing frisbee was dead. I suspect the flashing light was activated before it was put in the packaging and ran out the battery. This was a secret santa gift so I only found out afterwards and could not ask for it back for an exchange. In the future, I would appreciate it if the vendor checks this carefully before sending it out."
1,bad quality,DO NOT BUY THIS.it looks like its been already used.not worth of paying $17 and it looks cheap too.
2,Just a Frisbee,"I was looking for a light-up disc and thought this fit the bill. This is not a true disc; it is just a frisbee. It is not for disc golfers, but the kids might like it."
1,HORRIBLE SERVICE,the package didn't ship for over a month. When I originally placed the order I was supposed to get the package for christmas. when I emailed the shipper to cancel the order I didn't get a response and was just notified that the package had been sent. Horrible service. buy this product elsewhere! =) Thanks
1,Unsure,I ordered it for Christmas but I didn't get it until December 27th. It's now in a closet waiting for another gift-giving occassion.
5,Fantastic!,These are very durable and work great. I was worried about the LED lights lasting but they have made it through an entire summer of camp and beach and still works perfectly. My children were very happy with this product and I would definitely buy again as a gift.
5,Pretty darn awesome,The green glows! It is so bright. It's fun to watch this spin - it looks like a UFO. The weighting is great. This has the feel of a Frisbee. A great gift for a teenager or college student.
1,DO NOT BUY!,"The good reviews are for the old twist-switch design. The new push-button switch is terrible. This new switch doesn't work. The disc wont stay on, and after a few weeks of use, the disc will crack around the new button. The old design did work extremely well, but this new button is going to kill this once great product. If you need a light-up today, try the Black Jax options. The disc isn't the best, but it's much brighter, and the lights stay on."
4,Great Frisbee... unless it gets wet...,"I purchased the blue version for a midnight ultimate game. It works great and looks amazing in the dark. Unfortunately, it was a damp night and the battery kept having connection problems. The light would go out and we had to jiggle the disc to get it to work. However, after the disc was fully saturated with water, it stopped clicking off and just worked. I'm thinking about trying some vaseline in the future to keep the connection strong and keep out water. if I do, I will update this post.Pros:Bright and easy to see at nightFlys greatClose to ultimate disc weightConnection problem seems to disappear when fully saturated with waterCons:Battery has connection problem in wet grass"
4,Ultimate?,"This product is very nice, but the Frenzy flashes too often to be actually played with at night (I mean real ultimate here). The colors are great and I haven't had any problems with it yet. If you're hardcore into really playing and not just tossing at night, go for a solid color thats easy to see like the red. Still can't beat the price though!"
5,Flies surprisingly well.,"Amazingly, this disc flies almost as well as a regulation Ultimate disc. The light doesn't get in the way of the catch and it's proven to be durable. Scratching my head to pull out a negative and all I can come up with is that it's boring-looking in the daytime :)"
2,frizbee,it was nice untill the batteries went down after about 4 days and when i replace the batteries the lights never would come up as bright and yes i put the same batteries in it that came with it and flopped battery holder to see if it would help...it didn't...
1,Broke by second throw!,"On the surface the frisbee looks great and is actually a very good idea...BUT the problem is when you actually hit something!On our 2nd throw, at our daughter's 16th birthday party, the frisbee hit one of the kids in the head!It didn't hurt the girl, but the knob under the frisbee that holds the batteries and turns the frisbee's lights on and off came right off!There goes the lights and good luck finding two tiny batteries in the park....at night!!What a rip off!"
4,Awesome,"This frisbee has led to awesome night activities with my friends. Its incredibly cool and trippy to use this thing at night, and the frisbee is solid for daytime use as well. I havent had any problems with lights burning out (2 year owner) but I will say a dog will tear this thing to pieces. Grade of plastic is soft, though it makes for a comfortable throw."
5,Best Frizzbee ever <<<mispelled,love this friz. It was awesome till I got it wet in the gulf. Now it doesn't light up anymore and I needs me a new one.
5,Durable,We play night ultimate frisbee with about 150 players and 3 or 4 frisbees. These held up all summer long. Great product.
4,"Creative, Excellent for Night Frisbee-ing","The light up frisbee is a creative product and a lot of fun to play with at night. I had a blast playing some Ultimate Frisbee at night with this thing (players wear glow in the dark wristbands to differentiate teams). Great for any group activity that may take place in the dark. This is much better than frisbees made of 'glow in the dark' material in that you can see the light-up frisbee at night fairly well.The frisbee is not regulation 'Ultimate Frisbee' size and the light 'switch' at the bottom is finicky and does turn itself off from time to time. The switch is a round knob under the disc that you twist and a slight knock can sometimes throw it into the off position. This can get annoying at times.Frisbee is copyrighted, so when I say 'frisbee,' I mean ""flying disc."""
3,Light Up Frisbee - Batteries Very Difficult,"I really enjoy the Frisbee aside from the fact that the batteries came dead, and they are very difficult to switch.Easy to throw, great for late night ultimate"
5,Dig it!,Took this out to coachella music festival and everyone loved it! Was life of the party. Ended up buying color changing disc we liked them so much.
4,Four months of use and an update,"I bought this for my friend four months ago. We've had a blast playing ultimate frisbee in the dark and just tossing it around (the game 500, etc). It flies well (though I'm not all-knowing in that area) and seems to have survived all the usage (beach, mountain, park) ""in style"". It's a decent price and I don't know of any better glow-in-the-dark frisbee so I'd buy another. Glow bracelets are a handy addition.This month (August 2011) I purchased this frisbee for myself. I have recently played Ultimate Frisbee with standard ultimate frisbees and they fly better than the Flashflight. I am not a serious player, however, so I still think the Flashflight is great for having fun playing frisbee at night with friends."
5,Awesome Fun at Night,"These frisbees are absolutely incredible. Very high quality and the led light makes the frisbee very visible at night. Me and a couple of friends held a ""Tron Frisbee"" event where we used this frisbee and glow sticks to see players and the boundaries of the field. It was a blast and this frisbee was the key component to the fun we had."
5,Gift to my Grandson,My grandson was so happy with his gift. Was just what he wanted. He has played with his friends and they enjoy the night time frizz bee. Thank You
3,Not very bright,"It was a decent disk, but was not very bright. I thought the batteries were dead, so I bought new ones. Same result. It is a decent disk, but not amazing."
4,Awesome! But...,"First of all, I want to say that this Frisbee has been nothing but amazing. It has a clean release, goes straight, and is very easy to catch. My friend and I purchased this mostly for night time fris sessions, but it eventually became our ""go-to"" fris for all situations. The only reason that I am docking this 1 star is because after about a month, the lights would go out as we threw it (sometimes). We referred to it as the ""ninja"" throw because it would disappear into the 1am darkness and we'd have to try and find it before it hit us. Also, the frisbee started to warp after 2 months of heavy use. Other than those minor details, it's definitely a worthwhile purchase!"
2,The old version of this frisbee works better,"I've used the previous versions of this frisbee for ""night ultimate frisbee"" for a few summers now and they worked great. This latest update changed the ""on/off"" switch from a turning dial to a push button. The problem is, when you're straining to catch it, you'll often push the button and turn it off! I went back to using my old Nite Ize frisbee. It's old and worn, but it works."
5,Get green one for briteness,"I went camping in a field and there were two others. One was the lightest one, lites up alright but doesn't fly very well. The other was just as heavy as the green and flew well but was not half as brite as green. A great disc and a great lite from the green."
5,Blue Flashflight Light-up Flying Disc,It's AWESOME! Though it is extremely bright and throws off depth perception really bad...but it's still fun!
5,AWESOME!!,The best frisbee yet...that is if you like to play in the Dark. The LED's make it glow like a spaceship!! I will be buying another. Shipping and packaging was as expected.
1,Fun while it lasted,"The lights are spectacular on this disc and flying it in the dark is way cool. That being said, it didn't last long. Either water got into the electronics(I don't know how, I never played with it in water), or the wiring was faulty because the lights stopped working after a week of having this disc. Maybe I got a dud. Either way, I would seriously reconsider buying another one for over $20."
5,Great Frisbee!,"The led lights make this easily seen at night. Have played with this many times; it is awesome and you will enjoy it! The battery pack may slightly interfere with the flight of the frisbee, but it's not too noticeable."
2,Not so durable,"First of all the material quality is not so nice to play around. It is softer and this might be related to the light emitting situation. But still this is not a typical 175g flying disc, it is softer and not so steady. The light also causes a lot of problems not to light up and turn off every once in a while."
5,Best one out there,"I've honestly bought 4 different light-up frisbees and made one myself. This is hands down the best one! Closest feel to a real frisbee as well as good lights that aren't blinding or too distracting, just super cool looking. The only other one that was pretty good was a smaller size and had an assortment of colors, I'd say that one is better for kids due to the size (sorry, can't remember the brand but just look for it on amazon).But I've bought 2 more of these for friends and they love them. We have the blue and green colors which are both cool, but if you're on the fence about it, I'd say get the green one. Night time frisbee is the best, especially when you get a coupla these out there all flying at once. People walking there dogs in the area will have no idea what's going on."
5,Petadolex,"I do not know what I can say. This is a box of medication. It was what it was suppose to be. The boxes were in perfect shape. It came in a timely manner. Thanks, ~S"
4,Amazing story well told.,"This is a story that for the most part has been ignored. JPB lead a life that can hardly be believed for all its variety and triumphs. His political role in the Civil War (Atty Gen, Sec'y of the Navy, & finally Sec'y of State) was overshadowed by that of Jeff Davis, a fact he never tried to alter. However, that chapter of his life was both preceded by and followed by enormous successes in other arenas. That much of this took place in societies and times not very tolerant of Jews is just a bit of what we (in New Orleans) call 'lagniappe', that 'little bit extra' you get in the bargain. The book tells this story well and makes a most pleasant read."
2,Wobble mania!,"These mics sounds great, but they're unusable with the supplied rim mount. Whenever you hit the drum, the mic will wobble back and forth, about an inch each way. I can't believe they released this mic with this mount. It really is ridiculous."
3,Just OK for a starter.,"These are pretty cheap but for just a spare for the patio and when you don't want the good stuff getting ruined... use this. The salt, pepper & cheese shakers, well ahhh, the lids do not stay on all that well. But for $7.00 not too bad of a deal. Just make sure you have the lids on right. It doesn't hurt to bend them a bit to force them to stay on. The trivets are also a handy item to have when there is a big crowd over for some special occasion."
1,Getting stale,"Garth is getting tired, which makes sense since the author seems to be feeling the same way.Nothing new here, which is a disappointment.No bite in the humor any longer, nothing to keep you wanting more, nothing to make you feel like you can't wait for the next installment.Not awful, but not worth the read, either."
1,I wanted to like it...,"I wanted to like this book, but I found that I just couldn't. I liked the characters well enough in the first third of the book or so, but as Garth dug himself in deeper and deeper against even his own better judgement, I found myself getting more and more annoyed. I quit around halfway."
5,awesome funny slapstick humour,"This was just too funny! If you like Monty Python and the Holy Grail type humour you'll enjoy this.It is just too good. I was laughing and of course people are looking at me, but that is the beauty of it! Well worth the money."
3,Not as wacky as he thinks he is...,"Fun, enjoyable, reasonably good mystery/caper story, but the author is trying REALLY hard to be this zany/wacky/crazy guy and, to be honest, he probably hasn't put in enough time in Florida...I picked this book up because I was hoping for a Carl Hiaasen-esque writer, and while Wiprud has a swordfish's bill sticking out of his car window & musing about how dangerous it could be, Hiaasen or Tim Dorsey, or James W. Hall will use the same stuffed fish as a weapon, then a prosthesis, then a pinada.Wish that the blurbs hadn't led me to believe that this would be completely over-the-top quirky, because the information on taxidermy as hobby/business was interesting, NYC as a place to live when less-than-affluent is a good idea for main setting, the storyline moved along quickly, main characters sympathetic enough; no problems except that I'm not rolling in the aisles over the fact that live penguins will peck at stuffed penguins."
4,Great basic info on rabbit hunting,"This book covers the basics of hunting cottontail, including some very useful information that I found nowhere else about field dressing the rabbit. It describes rabbit habits and habitats, and is full of entertaining hunt stories. My main complaint about the book is the amount of space it gives to discussing hunting with beagles. 6 of the 22 chapters are exclusively about beagles: selecting, training, breeding and caring for beagles. Those who do not hunt with dogs will not find much use for all this information. Also, it would have been very helpful if the author had included in the book a listing of cottontail hunting availability state-by-state [...] But in general, this is a great book and I recommend it."
2,Alot of hunting stories and Guidance of training Beagles,"The title is very misleading. The author doe en excellent job of illustrating cottontail hunting with Dogs (beagles). I was looking for a rabbit hunting guide sans all the Beagle talk or at least a minimum of it.If you have dogs accompanying you hunting, get this otherwise it has probably 10 pages of material on hunting solo without dogs.Not what I was looking for. Title should be 'Rabbit Hunting with Beagles...'"
4,Great record!,"This is easily the best work Mark Olson has done since he was with the Jayhawks. This record shows the heartbreak he has recently encountered, but all the time there is a message behind the music, that there is something better coming along and he is ready for whatever that is. Through the heartbreak this is hope, and well, salvation.The 3 tracks that his former partner Gary Louris sings on, are just what is needed, it brings us back a little to their former greatness, and promises what is to come when their duo record comes out next year. Best tracks are Clifton Bridge, Salvation Blues, Sandy Denny and of course the old Jayhawks gem that was never recorded until now, Poor Michael's Boat.Highly recommended for anyone who loves singer-songwriter, from the heart, just good music, something that is sorely lacking in most of today's music."
5,Vinyl edition makes 'The Salvation Blues' even more enjoyable!,"This is a great album. An album that has to be felt to be fully appreciated. I've been listening to it since it came out, and I have to admit that it took some time to sink in. Now I listen to it more often than those early Jayhawks albums that I've always loved so much. Some people have already done a good job describing the quality of music here, so I'll just add that the vinyl version has made this record even more enjoyable for me. The sound is so full and warm... Mark's vocals especially sound more rich and full. And there are two bonus tracks not included with the cd..one of which is stunning! (Copper Coin)The quality of the vinyl itself is very high.. 180 gram pressing with a sturdy gatefold sleeve. All of the lyrics and liner notes are included. If you're a fan of this record, and have a turntable, I would highly recommend picking up the vinyl. I think it's how a record like this is meant to be heard."
2,Nervous Music,"Mark Olson's ""Salvation Blues"" begins with the weeper ""My Carol"" and continues with tracks like ""Poor Michael's Boat"" and ""National Express"" that have Olson's nervous vocals with his high and thin voice. The songs ""Keith"" and ""Sandy Denny"" appear to be musical biographies of people with problems. While I like this acoustic folk genre, neither Olson's voice nor his songwriting connect with me in much the same way that I've shelved all the Jayhawks CDs after a couple of listenings. ""My Salvation Blues"" sounds like nervous music for nervous people. It doesn't strike me as overly original or likeable. However, I do like the photography in the booklet. On the closer ""My One Book Philosophy,"" Olson's vocals are particularly painful. I fail to relate. Taxi!"
5,Simply Marley,"This story, these words, have a deep sense, a simple meaning. Once you read the story, discover the amazing man behind the words an thoughts....an amazing architect, and lover of life.....this is a great gift book."
1,I wonder if the autor was in Romania,"Come on!....Persecution?...If you ever were in Romania, just once, you couldn't write a book with such a title. I invite you all to come here and to see with your own eyes."
4,"Gorgeous, but heavy","This piece is stunning, but it's much too large and heavy for serving, the purpose for which I bought it. Still, very impressive and well priced."
2,Too big!,"This thing is huge. It would be okay for a party except they designed the spout very oddly, so that you can't control where it pours. It is very pretty, though, so buy this if you want a 14-inch tall decorative vase-type thing."
