5,Wonderful!,"I love this album!Ever since i got it, i have been listening to it once a day!PHENOMENAL!"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING,"When i first heard this cd i noticed something very different about it. THIS CD IS ALMOST HYPNOTIC. This cd from beginning to end is put together absolutely perfect and the ambience and atmosphere the guitars make for the music is perfectly fit for the songs. Not to mention, the vocals are top-notch (I wouldnt expect anything less from Green.) A GREAT BUY! Pick this cd up now if you want to hear something fresh that the music scene has needed for quite a while now.A MUST BUY FOR ANY MARS VOLTA FANS."
4,Turn off the Digital Zoom to get better EIS,"The Digital Zoom is just useless for most camera! It is just a marketing sick joke. Turn off that stupid Digital Zoomm then your EIS will work a lot better ( try not to zoom all the way to 10X). If you need to get closer to the object then try to use a telephoto lense converter ( may be around $99 for a decent one). Over all I think this camera is doing very well! I would definately recommend it! Video quality is superb! Still camera is not bad if you need a quick shot at something. The user manual is a real joke though but the menu is very easy to use. Thing you may need beside the camcorder:- IEEE cable- Adobe PremierYou will not be disappointed! At lest i didn't.The new PV-GS250 has the Optical I.S. so you may want to look at it as well. But to me, the PV-GS200 is very good you just have to get use to it."
5,Excellent,"This is a tourist-camera body with a professional output! I use this camera for commercial video and public access cable TV. I've taken this camera on vacation all over the world. On a flat panel TV, people always remark how incredibly good the resolution is on this camera, in all sorts of lighting environs. One of the standouts is the excellent lens and the sharp autofocus. It also rocks with a steadicam. My next camera is going to be a lot less fun because it is more bulky."
3,Needs to be replaced by the 1945 edition.,"Although its not widely known, the October 1944 edition of the Handbook on Japanese Military Forces was completely revised, updated and lengthened in September of 1945 with more accurate information after the war ended."
5,Excellent one volume work.,"This reprint of a restricted 1944 War Department Publicationis a companion to the Handbook on German Military Forces,but necessarily smaller as much less was known about the forcesof the Empire at that time. It is an admirable work nonetheless,containing everything of possible use to an Army officer facingthe enemy: organization, tactics, weapons and equipment, uniformsand insignia, extensively illustrated and with a glossary ofmilitary terms and map signs. An essential resource for WWIIbuffs, writers and readers of military history, collectors, and modellers."
3,Reenactor's tool,"This is a good reprint that fills a void of Japanese militaria. After the war, MacArthur decreed that all Japanese military related materials be destroyed, with few exceptions. With Japanese veterans (who survived) dying like US vets, anything related is vital. (If you are in or travel to Japan, befriend a veteran. Get his/her story. The world needs to know their side of the horrors).I would recommend that reenactors also purchase a copy. If it is ever republished, I recommend that it be bound in the same format as the original.Buy."
3,not good but OK,this game has very few good qualities. i was pleased when i bought it cause i wasn expecting much but this game its old extremly fast. graphics also are a problem. control is ok but is difficulty is EXTREMLY HARD. its a challenge. a ... challenge but i dont reccomend buying it. i reccomend vigilante 8 second offense its a great car combat game. its also cheaper than this...
4,Satisfying racing smash em up,I will be brief this game is fun if you ever played the old arcade game demolition derby (remember the game with the wrenches and oil slicks and the undressing hottie) anyway this game has a camera angle that lets me relive one of my alltime favorite video games. The amount of things there are to unlock is great including a car soccer game that is fun for two players only. The amount of customization is also sweet. If you like the genre and aren't obsessed with accurate racing pyshics you will have a good time with this one.
4,Demolition Racer scores,Demolition Racer No exit is in one way a racing game and in one way a demolition game. But unfortunately the racing part kind of takes away the demolition part a little. Because it is hard to concetrate on both aspects. If you are in first (which is the point) you wont be able to blow up cars. Because they are behind you. However the graphics are good and so is the control. So overall DRNE is a good game and will appeal to the casual gamer.
5,"Very comfortable, great fit","I love the Moto. The soft-boot style is very comfortable plus the internal shape fits my feet snugly. This is the most comfortable skate that I've tried so far. I also tried the K2 Exo 2.1 before buying these, which is also a good skate but the Moto felt just a little bit better. I noticed that I could put these on and get them off with less effort and time compared to my old skates due to Moto's new lace system. I've owned the same pair of Rollerblade Lightening for about 12 years and I was just bored of them. I had wonderful time with the Rollerblades and they served me well but this time around I wanted to try a different brand so I did not even look at Rollerblades again for replacement."
2,not good enough,"I am not satisfied with my k2s. The wheels disintegrated on me when skating on hot pavement. Two went out on the same skate!The other thing is, I really don't like the cushy boot. I want my skates to be firm against my legs. My rollerblades had a ratchet system which could tighten the boots well. The K2s don't and thus the feel is very sloppy and loose around my ankles. I will never buy K2s again."
1,Buyer beware,"Be leery - The first time I used these K2 Moto skates, the red/black tongue strap pulled off! Might be a quality control issue, but it shouldn't have happened. I contacted K2 customer support and it was like pulling teeth to have them replaced. Obviously, judging from the hassle, they do not have the customer in their best interest.I would be cautious with this K2 product and look into a pair of Rollerblades.Addendum - after waiting weeks for K2 to send me a new pair of Motos to replace the failed ones, I emailed K2's CEO Dodd Grande to explain the sloppy, incompetent, and arrogant customer service... and being left in limbo with no skates. A new pair of skates I was promised never came, so he finally cut me a check for a full refund.Bottom line - if they sell you faulty or defective equipment, demand refunds from companies like K2 . Don't compromise with your purchase. Good luck..."
5,To Pass Along!,"This is a pass along book. We all grew up with the old Nursery Rhymes, such as ""Baa, Baa, Black Sheep,"" Little Girls,""""The Old Woman,"" just to name a few. This book is filled with your favorites and accompanied with great illustratins to ring the words to life. A timeless tale, meant to be shared time and time again."
4,I'll be honest wit' ya!!,"Dana Gould's comedic presentation is definitely one to make note of. With material ranging from dating stories we can all relate to, to his irreverant Irish Catholic parents, Dana becomes an extremely quotable comedian. If you enjoy his work, try Brian Regan and Robert Schimmel."
5,"A ""Fun House"" full of laughs","Comedian Dana Gould offers up many laughs in his CD Fun House. Touching on his family life, the moon landing, and his love of Vincent Price that will bring tears of laughter to your eyes. Dana may not be a house hold name, but his jokes are grade A. Five stars out of five."
4,"very funny, I especially liked the Morrisey tribute","If you've seen Dana Gould before you'll love this CD, all new material. And, if you've never had the plesure, you'll simply have to experiance this one. Absolutely one of the best."
3,Defective dye job,"I should start by saying that I love this jacket's styling, fit and material. There is one problem though... The jacket I ordered was black/black but after a couple of months wear, I noticed the edges of the jacket are turning blue. (It appears that the felt cloth was originally blue and the black dying didn't hold.)The worst part of this experience is that on two separate occasions, I politely contacted the seller for advice on how to restore the blackness to the jacket and was completely ignored. (I didn't even ask for a replacement or compensation- just advice) I received no response!Defects happen from time-to-time and they are understandable...but poor customer service is unacceptable. It will keep me away from this seller."
4,Some magic performances here,"Torvill and Dean shine in ""You Don't Send Me Flowers,"" Paul Wylie is great performing to Miss Saigon, and Underhill and Martini have a great routine too, to Unchained Melody. There are some older skaters show here, Robin Cousins, John Curry, Dorothy Hamill and Peggy Fleming, but there is no Michelle Kwan here or Oksana Baiul. If you have a love for some of the older skaters who aren't skating anymore, this video is fine for only a couple of skaters shown in this video are actually performing now days."
3,aged tape,"Beautiful performances, but the tape is too old. The picture is poor. Some of the clips are better than others, none are really good."
4,Charming little book,"I bought this book for my son who is 20 months old and LOVES books. He is getting too ""old"" for many of his board books but is too squirmy to sit through most story books so this is a wonderful transition book. It tells a nice little story and, unlike other cheesy lift-the-flap books, the illustrations are all Classic Pooh. The flaps really blend in with the rest of the illustrations so it does make for more of a challenge to lift them but my son thinks that is more fun. He also likes that there is a different Pooh character under each flap and that they are all together at the end."
3,"Worth the read, but you do need an instructor","I read this after enrolling in Pilates classes. The book was a quick and easy read, and it's nice to have photos handy of different exercises. I do not, however, think a novice can rely on this book alone to get the benefits of Pilates. There are simply too many nuances to the postures involved."
4,contrology,Most useful for someone familiar with pilates already. Interesting to see how pilates has evolved from contrology to present day pilates. I found the book to be an informative addition to my pilates library.
3,Pilates' Return To Life Through Contrology,"This book is in black and white, but it was first published in 1945. It contains a history of the man (Joseph Pilates) that founded the Pilates' Method for physical fitness, control and mindfulness of body structure and posture, and a series of illustrated instructions for 34 of his Poses and Exercises. This is the book all Pilates' enthusiasts should read, and perhaps own, as it will become a constant reference guide to the correct manner for poses when at home.I am very happy with my purchase and it did arrive at the time promised and in good condition."
1,"waste of time, buy a more instructional book","This book was written in the early 1900's and represents a plea for Americans to reconsider their lifestyle and begin adopting healthier habits. While many of the tenents are somewhat applicable to modern life, the entire book is little more than a rambling, redundant series of complaints against society. I was waiting for the solutions to come, instructions about returning to a healthy lifestyle or actual pilates exercises, but that cannot be found in this book. His writing is more draining than inspiring. I would recommend finding a book with actual pilates exercise instruction and theory rather than bitter, unreasonable rants."
3,Pilates=Delsarte+European Physical Culture circa 1890,"Pilates work differs little from Delsarte theory and its decomposition exercises. The writings of Joseph Pilates is stunningly similar to the late 19th and early 20th century works of such physical culture luminaries as Bess Mensendieck, Alice Bloch, Genevieve Stebbins, Professor Attila (the trainer of Sandow and Klein) the coursework of Henry Titus, and many more examples could be found in works by Charles MacMahon, Bernarr MacFadden, Charles Atlas and Tilney.While it is good that this information is out there, readers should be aware that Pilates is not revolutionary in any way. Time and motion photographic studies of the human body date to the 1880's and Taylor's principles of optimal body movement were evident in early 20th century physical culture exercise training found all over the Western world."
4,Joe is a great writer.,"Joe wrote two really good books. YOur health and return to life. He espouses the greeks and athenians. A sane mind in a sound body, not too much and not too little and know thy self were all high points in his books. I highly recccomend this book.Sinverely,E.sill"
3,On-line purchase of White Diamonds parfum spray,"This product sells out at my local store. There is plenty of ""toilette"" spray but little ""parfum"" spray. This dealer was just what the doctor ordered! My wife is satisfied and I don't have to worry about Valentines Day, Sweetest Day, Birthday or anniversary for a while. I will purchse from them in the future."
4,"I love this perfume, sadly cannot wear it","I love this perfume, sadly cannot wear it anymore. It is a great scent, like baby powder. I always got compliments when I wore it. Since I went cruelty free I can no longer buy or wear it. Now I wear Wisteria or Sensuous."
2,did not like,"my girlfriend did not like the smell, she said it smelled like "" old lady perfume "" could not return it, according to amazon hazardous return list."
1,Product spring is broken,"I brought this product for my Mom, but the package that I got doesn't work. I think there is a spring missing in the top which makes it unusable. and since this item contains flammable liquid, I can't even return it."
4,I LOVE THIS 1!,"It was really great!The only thing I didn't like is that Celia is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooostupid! When Jonathan goes to get her & Joe, she says, ""Mandie, come on out!"" I LOVE it! Whenever I play dolls, I always play Mandie,and I have a Polly! The whole pincushion thing was really interesting!"
2,"Better than last one, BUT...","But there wasn't much excitement until near the end of the book. And as for Mandie, if she is going to be going to college next year, don't you think she should GROW UP! Everytime anyone says NO, she gets all upset and is even MORE determined to do what they don't want her to do. I have been disappointed with the last book and this one was only slightly better, but hardly a mystery. I don't know why the last two books haven't been that good. But I do hope they start to get better. I really wish Lois Gladys Leppard would have continued writing more books on the Lily adventures."
1,Mandie book is not all that Dandy,"Oh Lois, Lois, Lois. What have you done? This book was downright awful...The Mandie books are supposed to be about Mandie's life and adventures. The only thing I can say about this book is that there is no true mystery, no imagination, and no creativity. Most Mandie books have captured my senses and made me want to turn page after page, in pursuit of the solution to the mystery. This book just does not do that. There is nothing interesting to read about.Another thing to note: Mandie is growing up, but her attitude doesn't show it. She still acts like a 10 year old that always pouts and is obscene. Lois Gladys Leppard needs to show that Mandie has grown up, because it sure doesn't seem like it.My only hope is that the upcoming books will be more satisfactory.I suggest that you only read this book for the sake of keeping up with the series- not for suspense, mystery, or ingenuity."
5,great pans- great service,great pans- these were hard to find but I found them on amazon.They are great to take and not worry about having to pick up your pan----although secretly I want the pan back to reuse over and over:).Thank you..
4,Ovenware for Pot Luck Dinners,I really like this product this time of year. I can take my favorite recipes to pot luck meals and don't have to worry about getting my dish back.
1,Yikes,Bought this used it oven set at 325 for 12 minutes melted all over my oven ! Would absolutely never buy this again!!!
3,An offbeat use . . .,"I am in the process of sorting and cataloging thousands of old family photographs and desperately needed something better than shoe boxes in which to temporarily store the sorted photos. I hit upon the idea of using cake pans but needed several dozen and the cost of metal pans is prohibitive. When I ran across these light plastic covered pans at reasonable prices they appeared to be the answer to my need so I purchased two dozen.While they did serve my need for temporarily storing photos, these pans are very lightweight and feel 'flimsy' when filled with anything of significant weight.I have now replaced the stacks of pans with lightweight plastic drawer sets which are much better suited to the task of storing photos.I never did use the pans for their intended purpose but my wife now has two dozen of these in her pantry awaiting our next picnic."
5,Impressive live recording of a powerful messae,"Heard BEYOND SURVIVAL: THE NEXT CHAPTER, writtenand narrated by Gerald Coffee, Captain, U.S. Navy (Ret.), whoendured seven long years in a communist prison in NorthVietnam . . . this was a live recording of a speech he has madethroughout the country, in which he tells how he survived andwhat lessons he learned from his experience . . . he advises thelisteners to have faith, as well as to learn to rely upon themselves, others, country, and their God . . . doing so will enable us to get through our own ""struggles for survival,"" which only speaking for myself, seem insignificant to what Coffee had to endure . . . my only regret was in not being able to hear Coffee deliver this powerful message in person . . . he seems like he is quote some guy, and I was so impressed by his message that I had to listen to this powerful tape twice . . . in fact, I'm now going to seek out his original book: BEYOND SURVIVAL."
1,"Unique, but that's not necessarily a complement ..............","A voice which is nice when soft, nice when loud, but very ordinary in the middle."
3,Decent basic review but a bit outdated.,"This is a good overall summary to the field of Reliability Engineering. The volume, while filled with excellent descriptions and easy to follow examples, nonetheless needs a much needed update to cover contemporary work in the field."
4,Warehouse 13,Like the story line. Found series by accident and have enjoyed the episodes seen. Will eventually see the other episodes.
5,AWESOME SHOW!!!,LOVED SEASON ONE IT SHOWS HOW IT ALL STARTED. HOW PETER AND MYKA ENDED UP BEING WAREHOUSE AGENTS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SHOW
3,Could have been a classic,"Warehouse 13 - an interesting premise for a show. The most powerful land of the time hosts a warehouse of artifacts that must be hidden away.Unfortunately, it's saddled with two weak starring actors. Pete is hard to see as the male lead. Not too smart, or capable. Myka has the classic female TV go-getter role, so no personality (though wait for Season 2).However, Artie, Claudia and the artifacts themselves (usually) keep the show watchable. Worth getting when on sale."
4,"Good, funny, entertaining series. Love it!","This isn't X-Files, Fringe or SGU, or any of the big, awesome, freaky syfy shows. It's different; it's refreshing, and not depressing like so many conspiracy theories can become. It's funny, and has a lot of interesting historical information (and obviously a lot of made-up artifacts!); the show is entertaining and the characters are cool. I am a fan of this show and will keep watching it!Bought the 1st season dvd from amazon; it comes in a carton dvd box, which sucks, but it's bearable. i just wish the series had more episodes! it's so short! that being said, it's expensive for it's small size (i didn't buy at 20$). I give the show 5 stars, and 3 on product, so evens out to 4."
4,Really Great Series!,"So why did I only give it 4stars. I was personally disappointed with some of the endings. The acting was fabulous. The sets were good. The initial story line was gripping and many of the conclusions were outstanding. But a few of the conclusions left me saying ""Huh? Did they run out of money or ideas?"" Still I like the series and would be future seasons."
4,Great New Series on Sci Fi,I really enjoyed the pilot and 1st episode. Kind of reminded me of Friday the 13th the series. I would recommend it.
5,Great New Series!!,What will they think of next? This is a very interesting and fun show to watch. The characters also have great chemistry. Check it out and you'll get hooked!
2,A good show about some of the worlds greatest secrets are guarded by white people.,"This is a Sci Fi show so it may end without any reason what so ever or it may have a confusing ending because Sci Fi might want to wrap it up quick. I've been watching it and have been trying not to get invested in the characters for this reason. Maybe if the show ends and has a real ending I'll buy it but basically I'm looking at this like another Sci Fi from people who can't spell SCi Fi.A good show about some of the worlds greatest secrets are guarded by white people. Like most shows on Sci Fi these days it sports a mostly white cast that heroically saves white people from supernatural creatures. I don't want to spoil anything but I will say one thing. The white people always win and if you are not white and on this show, you might not last long."
1,Bad,"Honestly I don't see how this show has any reviews over 3 stars. First of all it is completely ridiculous, but not in any kind of humorous or witty way, just really stupid. The characters are incredibly boring, one of the main characters basically acts like a poorly portrayed child, the others aren't too bad, just not that interesting.The plot of the show itself could do a lot.. but it doesn't. Instead of unraveling a mystery behind the objects, it just shrugs it off and basically says who knows, who cares. And just about every famous person they can think of in history they just say it belonged to them, not adding this to overall the plot or anything. And the ""villain"" kind of has no real back story, just some guy that used to work there randomly screwing with them.The show is about a couple people that seem to have no clue how to do their job nearly getting themselves killed every episode trying to place random objects in a vat of goo and store it in a warehouse."
1,Hilarious - really?,"Maybe I've got a different Warehouse 13, but the names all match, so I doubt it. I couldn't get past DVD 2 of 3. This is, in my opinion, X-Files meets the Night Stalker. (For you young folk, a 70s era newshound who gets mixed up in ancient Indian rituals, strange magnetic fields, etc.) I'm a very long time scifi fan, but these shows require way too much of a leap of faith for me. Having read a comment about how the later shows were better, I will have a look at the third DVD before dumping this into Goodwill donation box."
4,DVD problems,"I find I agree with all the negative reviews here, especially Paula's insightful one, but I like the show anyway and will continue to watch. It has an odd charm. My problem is with the DVD (first season). It has good visual quality and one merciful feature that should be mandatory on all DVDs: hitting the menu button the moment it loads will bring up the main menu, bypassing all the boiler plate and promos. Unfortunately, it seems to lock up sometimes when you try to use reverse play (necessary if you want to look at the credits that go screaming by in overdrive). It hits the beginning of a video block and won't respond to any command. I've had to turn the DVD player off three times during the first 4 episodes to recover function. A minor annoyance, but there it is. And the penultimate episode had no sound at all (fortunately, it was closed captioned).It's interesting how deeply anti-science (on many levels) fantasy can be, for a genre that's often allied or confused with SF."
4,ENTERTAINING SCIFI SERIES,"PROS:*Fun premise with lots of room to grow*Eddie McClintock, Saul Rubinek and CCH Pounder*Roger Rees slimy villain*Overall good directorsCONS:Joanne Kelly's mediocrity*Leads too reminiscent of BONES and X-FILES*The obnoxious Claudia just drags the show down*FX pretty lame*Some plots are too predictableSUMMARY: Series is fun; hope the second season shows some growth."
2,It is far worse than other series that were killed,"It is just something to watch when your favorite program is not available. I don't like the characters or the script. I'd vote to kill it, not worth the time."
4,good start,"This looks like a good start to a series with some potential.To the guy that said it looks like a pilot...duh. It's the first episode.And Scifi (Syfy now) is putting out Stargate Universe this year, and Caprica, so there is your Stargate and Battlestar Galactica.Looking forward to a new episode of Warehouse 13 though. Should be a great freak of the week show."
4,recommend this one,I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase. I enjoyed this. recommend this purchase.+
4,An Enjoyable Pilot Episode! Recommended For SciFi (or is that SyFy) Fans,"Warehouse 13 has a lot of potential, as shown in this very enjoyable pilot episode. I think of this somewhat along the lines of X-Files meets Indiana Jones, in that you have two Secret Service agents investigating paranormal events, and are based out of the warehouse that bares a lot of resemblance to the one at the end ofIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition).There is a good bit of humor in this episode and the casting works fairly well, with the by the book Myka offset by the loose cannon Pete. I hope SyFy give this series a change to gel.Recommended for fans of the genre."
5,Excellent Series,An excellent series that allows you to mix reality with fiction. Who know what the US government and other nations have deep in their vaults. Many have been searching for the unusual for centuries...why do we not think they may found some of what we see on these dvds
3,Not as good as i'd hoped,"We were looking for a sci-fi series to investigate after Fringe. With that as a comparison, probably nothing would match up. These characters are of the 'one-note' variety and I find it hard to care about them. It does grow on you after awhile however and can be interesting and fun, but not terribly original or surprising."
5,Great show,"I started watching in the middle of season three, and I was hooked. I had to buy the other seasons, and I wasn't disappointed. It's a great show, funny, intelligent, and smart."
5,Awesome Introductory Season!,"""America's Attic"" is quite amazing! The characters are intriguing and the plot lines are twisted enough to keep you on your toes but not loose you."
5,Love the show,Enjoy the fact that I can now watch the first season whenever I want to commercial free. Love the show!
2,Boring,"Great concept! I would have loved to seen this show well-done, but it was boring and not well-done. I would roll over and go to sleep when this was on, and couldn't wait to resell it."
2,Disappointing copy of Skully and Mulder,"There's no excitement, hook grabbing plot, in your face twist or anything. Each episode is just mindless standalone-ish ""bag & tag""..."
2,Disapointingly average,"I loved the first single ""No Tomorrow"", and particularly enjoyed the video - the model is super hot :). The track is energetic and has a great pop sensibility.However, I was disappointed when I bought the album because, apart from the title track, which also has a very catchy chorus, the remainder of the album slips into the lower side of the mediocrity scale."
5,Popmusic true to form,"For those who know lots and lots of popmusic this album may come as a very nice surprise.I can imagine what buying an early Beatles allbum must have felt like at the time.Sheer excitement!One tantilising song after another. Orson have toured the UK extensivelyand took in the best of what's been around there since te stone-ageof popmusic (Beatles, not Stones!!) and the subsequent periods (XTC and later.)The energy is everywhere, in the songs, the playing and the singing,in the lyrics while the production is wide and sometimes hoarse.This is popmusic true to form and at it's very best."
2,Don't waste your money....,The product allows light with privacy... but the bubbles that appear while trying to apply it is irritating. I am sorry that I did not buy the more expensive brand. My loss.
3,Not all that I was expecting,"I was hoping to use this product to ""frost"" my front door which is mostly glass. This product was hard to get to stick smoothly and it creases way too easily. I'm usually good with contact paper, so I was kind of disappointed. Though, I did use the remaining portion to do small panes on a back door. That worked nicely."
5,Exactly what I wanted,This contact paper is high quality and matched other furniture I have perfectly!It was easily installed. I would not hesitate ordering from this source again.
2,Looks crappy from the other side,"I tried to use this on a window on my RV, and I was careful and applied very slowly, and there were still way too many bubbles and creases, to where it looked terrible from the outside and I just ripped it off. Instead, I used a can of frosting spray-paint from Home Depot, and that looked way better. Still not perfect, but way better than this stuff, which is now in the trash.I gave it 2 stars because its possible someone else might have been able to apply it better and get good results. But I couldn't do it."
3,"Would have been great, but defective","Product appeared to be exactly what I was looking for: frosted enough to give some privacy to my front door while still allowing light in. Unfortunately, in several places the paper backing would not separate from the contact paper. Unless I wanted large splotches of paper backing attached to my window, this product was useless. This doesn't seem to have happened to anyone else, based on the other user reviews, so apparently I received a defective roll. Perhaps one that had been sitting in storage for too long. I returned it for a refund."
1,kittrich shelf paper,"It was terrible. They sent the wrong paper. Apparently, it was mismarked and they did not have the one they showed on website. I had to return it."
1,AWFUL,Wrong PRODUCT SHIPPED!! It simply isn't worth the hassle to return this item for the price. They sent me Clear Shelf/Box liner... not FROSTED WINDOW FILM.... be better
4,Does a good job of frosting glass!,"I bought this to use on the window in my bathroom and it turned out great! Sure, I had to measure and cut it myself, but that's what I expected. The end result is exactly what I pictured it being."
4,GOOD PRODUCT,"I bought this contact paper via amazon to match some I already had. It worked out fine --perfect match, easy to work with."
3,Not Labeled as Window Film,"This product is intended for use on shelves and other flat surfaces you want to protect. It is not labeled as window film and the adhesive shows after application. That said, it does work as a frosted window film, if you don't mind the non-uniform appearance."
3,Not good for thick-covered books...,"I attempted to use this for hardcover textbooks with thick front and back covers.The product adhered great to the flat surfaces of the front/back covers, but when I tucked the extra 1.5"" around the edge onto the inside of the cover, these ""flaps"" wouldn't stay put -- it wasn't adhesive enough. I've never had this problem with other brands of contact paper. I had to resort to tape to secure these inside flaps; the other option would have been to trim the flaps altogether, but I like to protect the bottom and side edges of the book, as that's where most damage occurs.My bottom line opinion: This product works great when it stays flat (e.g. laminating stuff), but don't rely on it for any applications where you need to bend, fold, wrap, or tuck a small edge or flap: the contact paper since it isn't sticky enough to hold its own. I'll be getting a different brand for future textbook-covering endeavors."
2,terrible contact paper,"Bought this contact paper to cover working area, it is horrible as far as sticking ability, would suggest if you are looking for contact paper this is not it"
5,MCP/MCDBA Review,"Greetings fellow developers,Once again DV Press has produced a solid title that satisfies the .Net needs of the development community! If you are brand new to VB.Net this DVD is for you. The product also has enough information in it to be quite useful for more experienced developers as well!

Division"
2,Its OK but.......,"This dvd is pretty unprofessional in its content. The volume during the speaking parts is very low although the music is very loud. The scenes look like they were shot once then they moved on to the next topic. Rick seems to stumble and mumble throughout the dvd, and it makes the dvd very hard to follow. All in all this dvd turns something that should be fairly easy and straight forward into something very confusing. Although if you do manage to pull a few concepts or if it clears something up in which you had a question with then i guess its worth it. Just try not to follow too closely or it might get you confused."
2,Unprofessional production,"I waited for this with exitement, but was disapointed when I opened the package and played the DVD.The voices was low, just like the teacher was talking into a bucket (think they compressed it too much) a metallic sound. Between the teaching it was an ""music"" that was just like an alarm bell, that was really hight volume. May the purpose of this is to wake up the student??This made it really hard to follow the classes for an foreigner. But it was ok when you saw it a couple of times and understood what he was saying.Cheap, but not really good"
1,Not worth buying.,"Not worth buying. Save your money. 3 or 4 pages of text suggesting when and where the ceremony should be held, then a lot of unrelated pictures used as filler."
1,You can find something similar but cheaper,"I found a case that's almost exactly like this one, except it's $10 cheaper.It's made by Samsonite. model # TM90BLU (there is also a black case). but like I said, exact same thing. Unless you care about your camera case saying ""lumix"", save yourself some dough and get the one from Wal-mart."
2,Strong but too bulky,"This case looks good and protects the camera adequately, but is too bulky. It hasn't got a lot of room inside - I was unable to fit an extra SD card in its little case and a spare battery. The belt clip is difficult to use, and I end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time. There are better cases for this camera."
2,Panasonic hard case,This case will protect your camera but has no place for spare battery or even a extra memory card. It only has a spring clip to fasten it to a belt or bag there is no belt loop or other handle strap. There are other cases available with better features for less money.
3,Good Coveralls,"I was not as excited about these coveralls due to the way the crouch area was cut. The way they designed the crouch seemed to be the issue with me. My body type did not work it at all. However, I would recommend, but be care of the crouch area."
4,direct instruction book,The book was what I needed. I thought it would have the color version for the cover but its still the same content so that's not a problem. good service.
5,Take a journey across your country and your soul!,"This book opened my eyes to many things within myself and the world around me. Steve McAllister is living proof that anyone can have an amazing life, and that you do not need to be rich or powerful to accomplish great things. As a person who has spent the better part of my life struggling with my belifes and with Christianity especially, I found this book to be most helpful and informative on religion without being overbearing. This book was a pleasure to read from begining to end, and I recommend it to anyone! Enjoy the journey!"
3,Too Long,"I would love this bag if it were flipped around and the side was the top. As designed, it is too long to comfortably carry as a bag. It would work on a stroller, however. Who wants that many separate bags, though?!"
3,looks good but not enough space,"It is well made and does look nice. However, it needs a flap at the top as when it is full (as it often is with all the items I carry for a baby and a hungry potty training toddler ie. change of clothed for each, bags of food and cartons of juice) the bag gaps because the velcro which should holds the main compartment closed can't meet and the world can see everything inside that could also fall out easily. The zip pockets at the top of the main compartment though are useful to get my items, like money and keys, quickly but also keeps them secure. A nice looking bag but could do to be a little wider and close better."
4,Lots of Enlightenment,"Whether you are new to crystals or continuing your passion, you will want this book for your collection. The book provides a cursory overview of crystals and provides great insight into the laying of stones. This author was mentioned has a healer and crystal specialist by Drunvalo."
1,Obviously not Science - remove from Crystallography,"I haven't read this book and certainly don't intend to. I don't care if some people want to read about crystal healing, and other New-Age stuff, but Amazon.com certainly shouldn't put this into their ""Science and Nature"" category. It has little to do with nature (except the peculiarities of human nature) and nothing whatever to do with science."
2,This book is woefuly inadequate,"This book goes in two directions.1. Channeled information about a sub set of stones.2. The book is more about crystal healing, and has some VERY complex crystal layouts.This book only deals with 40-60 different stones, and you wll not find information about many of the popular stones; such as Chevron Amethyst, Ametrine, Angelite, Blue Quartz, Green Quartz, Labradorite, Moldavite, etc.Personaly I would recommend that you get a copy of ""Love Is In The Earth...."" by A. Melody.Contact me via E-Mail if you have questions or comments; Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
5,The first book I ever made written notes in!,I know it sounds corny but this book became a teacher to me and a mentor and was the first book (besides school text books) that I ever wrote in and you have to understand that books are sacred to me! My crystals spoke to me when they said 'take me home with you' and this book told me why I heard them and why I knew I wasn't crazy after all!
2,Low Capaciy- OK Watergun,"When I tried Load and Shoot SuperSoaker, I was very dissapointed. It doesn't Shoot that far,and the water capacity is very very small. It was easy to refill, but I had to refill about 20 times in 5 minutes. I would only recommend the Load And Shoot SuperSoaker to little children, not big kids. For older kids, I would recommend the A.R.M 4000 XL water gun, and The SuperSoaker FlashFlood. Overall this is an OK water gun. With small capacity and low shooting power, this would not be the water gun of my choice, so I would not recommend this expensive toy."
1,Do not get this water gun,This is the worst water gun ever. It's shooting range is six feet.Do not get this water gun!
2,Greatest hits? R.G. never had 'hits',"Rory never had mainstream hits, and I'm quite happy about that.But lets get real people,,,,who the heck wants somebody else picking out the 'greatest hits' for you, me or any other Rory fan? Fact is, with Rory being so supremly talented, and us being such huge fans, we will buy up all the regular releases, and some of Donals compliations such as the excellent Wheels within wheels. Face it, 'Greatest hits' albums are only good for acts like Billy Joe and Hall and Oats. Nuff said."
1,Thanks for warning me off,"Thanks to these Rory fans for their honest reviews. I just learned from a Rory newsgroup that this CD was out, and hoped to find out more on amazon.com. I'm greatly disappointed to learn that this ""greatest hits"" package is poor both in terms of mixing and song selection. I argued years ago for a Rory box set, but many Rory fans said we'd be better served by reissues with bonus tracks. Since Donal Gallagher has chosen to issue a greatest hits CD that is highly unsatisfactory, I once again call for a box set, even though I already have all the original LPs, the original CD versions, the reissues, and many bootlegs."
3,"Warm, but cheaply made","I purchased these coveralls for my fiancee for Christmas, and I chose to order these ones off of Amazon to save a little bit of money. They are nice and warm, but the first time he put them on, one of the zippers on the leg broke off. You get what you pay for I guess!!"
3,Good introduction to Business Law... but lack of focus,"This is a great introduction to Business Law with lots of interesting case studies. However, the long chapters make this book hard to wade through. The book covers quite a lot, but this wide coverage dilutes the focus on the key topics of each chapter.I was confused about the tie with ""e-Business"". It seems that this is just an older Business Law book with a few added sections pertaining to the internet. The title of this book is definitely misleading; the majority of this book does not focus on ""e-Business"".Overall the book has a lot of good content; however, professional guidance (ie: a good professor) in required to get any real benefit. While I still use this book as a reference, I would not recommend using this book for a class."
2,Reality show for willing to understand,"An Italian-Australian girl pupil found herself of demand by male peers and older man, caught between usual for Australia ghetto of a local community separation and mainstream sexual activities.Realistically reflecting segregation and apartheid constituting everything in that, for instance, part of a British Commonwealth, a movie provides a slice of information to outsiders having a distant from a relaxed, mostly sunshine and snow-free living environment."
3,Should be titled: Beginning Painter and Maya,"To help out folks looking to buy this book, I just want to point out a few things I wish I'd known before buying it. First, if you are buying it for the Don Seemiller portion, you'd be much better off buying his ""Digital Character Design and Painting"" book, recently updated. I can't recommend that book highly enough. The current volume presents something resembling an excerpt from the Seegmiller book, taking up the first 90 pages, with the remainder of the book being a basic introduction to Maya. It's TONS of screen shots (in color, unusual for this publisher), with very little verbiage.In short, I'd only recommend this book if you are looking for a nice short intro to character design with Painter and a beginner's guide to Maya. The title is very misleading."
2,Jaw-droppingly stupid!,"This movie is bad even by Ed Wood standards! It somewhat borders the line of ""so bad it's good"" like Plan 9/Grave Robbers from Outer Space and Jail Bait and just so bad it's BAD! Essentially the story of a transvestite and his struggle for acceptance, it's filled with the usual ""Edwoodian"" trademarks as ham acting, atrocious dialougue (checkout the completely senseless jabbering of Bela Lugosi superimposed over a city street early on in the film. POOL ZE STRING! DANCE! SNAKES SNAILS AND PUUPY DOG TAILS! Whhhaaat???), and scenes that come and go without rhyme or reason. This was his first major feature, so it doesn't all hang together yet, but even fans will have a rough going with this! Good luck and hold on to your noses!"
1,Too Bad even to be Funny,"Ed Wood films have a tendency to be bad enough that they are actually funny to watch. ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is just such an example. Glen or Glenda is not.Unlike the title character, this moview never quite figures out what it wishes to be. It comes across sometimes as a bad documentary, sometimes as a drama of human conflict, sometimes as an allegory of good and evil. It makes all these attempts and fails miserably in each of them.Put your money into something entertaining, educational or inspiring. This isn't it."
3,Awful but enjoyable,"It seems that Ed Wood set out to make a really profound statement with this film, but he succeeded only in producing a film remarkable for its awfulness. Between the dreadful acting, the inane script, and the mismatched stock footage, this one is a mess from beginning to end. In the midst of this hodgepodge is Bela Lugosi, reciting a series of nonsensical vintage Ed Wood phrases. As a drama, it gets no stars, but for pure laughability, it gets three big stars. Just hold your nose and laugh!"
4,Interesting movie,"Interesting movie, especially for the time frame. I love that is talks about men's wear and women's wear. Kind of funny watching it now and looking back to that era."
2,bad DVD transfer of demented masterpiece,"The Rhino video of Glen or Glenda is quite a bit superior to this somewhat seedy DVD transfer. The periodic jumps are remarkably annoying, and the sound quality is no picnic either. Someone needs to do Ed Wood's pics the right way, and this isn't the right way."
4,Fun for Discriminating Minds,"These three films regularly appear on ""100 All-Time Worst Movies,"" but the fact is that they're a whole lot of fun. Bride of the Monster and Plan 9 resemble horror and science-fiction films of the 40s and 50s, but they possess an open-ended charm rarely found in those early B-films. Wood is criticized as ""inept"" when he was really just ""out there,"" in every sense. Glen or Glenda is an assault on right-thinking people everywhere and it is a priceless document of good intentions gone bonkers. These films are worthwhile also because they all feature Bela Lugosi. He is particularly over-the-top in Glen or Glenda and Bride of the Monster, in which he plays a mad scientist gone mad - a neat trick."
2,SIZE 18 FROM OUTER SPACE (*A Haiku Review),"Ed's pink angoraIN GLORIOUS BLACK AND WHITE.""Oooh, that's scary, kids!""~ Stephen or Stephanie T. McCarthy<""As a dog returns to his own vomit, so a fool repeats his folly.""~ Proverbs 26:11>"
5,Wonderful Movie,"I received the box set for christmas, and they are by far the best movies, Edward D. Wood Jr. have done. He's an excellent Director. I highly recommend the mvies."
3,ed wood is a cheese dog,"this is one of ed woods better films & accually has a consistant(slightly) & meaningful plot. it is heartwarming to watch it & think ""gee ed wood made this about himself."" the only thing that drags the movie down is that crazy middle scene where bela lagosi keeps moving his eyebrows up & down. ed is a cheese dog!"
1,"Worth a look, but...","There are two reasons why I watched this film:1) Because it is included in ""The Ed Wood Box"" set, which has much more enjoyable films (even though they're all bad).2) Because the Tim Burton film ""Ed Wood"" includes the making of ""Glen or Glenda?"" as a part of its plot, and it is great to see how close they got when they showed Johnny Depp, Sarah Jessica Parker and Martin Landau imitating scenes from the film.There are a couple good moments, like when Bela Lugosi shouts ""PULL THE STRING! PULL THE STRING!!"" But the story's narrative is incredibly jumbled, the dialogue poor, and everything about it is barely watchable. It is still amazing that this film even got made. If you think ""Plan 9"" or ""Bride of the Monster"" are bad films, watch ""Glen or Glenda?"" and you'll think the other Wood films are Shakespeare."
2,lunacy,"The star ratings above don't adequately express what this film is like. It it horrendously bad, but there are times when the unspeakable awfullness is just too unbelievable to hate. Bela Lugosi's scenes, in which he sits in a dark room and utters cryptic phrases in a creepy Hungarian accent, form a counterpoint to the cross-dressing story that is funny beyond belief.Like many demented films, this one is made in earnest. Viewing it in earnest will be very very painful. But if you're in the mood for slow-paced but comically incompetent cinema, or if you are stoned, this might be the film for you."
2,The dullest movie ever made.,"I am a fan of 'bad' movies like the one's Wood produced, but this movie is just painful to watch. Clocking in at a little over an hour it feel's like three. Bela Lagosi is just perposturous and Wood, in the title role, is no better. This was supposed to be his outing himself movie but it is just plain stupid. When Bela looks down on a crowded street and say's, with a stright face, ""People, always going somewhere"" you would be wise to just turn the film off. Woods first, and worst film Glen/Glenda is for the hardcore Ed Wood fans. Other's avoid this like the plauge......."
3,What the ----? Three stars for weirdness,"This movie's plot is pretty hard to follow, but the concept is so out there, and the images / film segments used to support it can only be described as bizarre, bordering on insane.This movie was pretty damn boring. I couldn't even sit through it, and that's before the on-screen sex change operation (unedited). I wouldn't recommend buying this, unless you're REALLY into bad movies.I saw this movie because I saw ""Ed Wood"" by Tim Burton. Now THERE is a good movie.-- JJ Timmins"
4,Touching,"[...] Didn't Bobby stay with Jonathan after Clare and the baby left, even though Jonathan was dying and Bobby's greatest fear was being alone? I found this movie very touching, and the performances very real. Colin Farrell's performance was a revelation. Not to mention, as Clare does, that he's ""adorable"" in this movie. My only regret is that they didn't show Bobby and Jonathan being physically intimate after they were teenagers."
3,Unfinished...,"After reading several reviews about this film, I thought I'd like to see it for myself.After viewing the film, I was disappointed with the ending, which seemed to leave the film unfinished.In some ways, I felt the character of Bobby not quite believable; as though he was too naive to be real.The character of Jonathan was overly surly and callous.I will watch the film again, hoping to find some positive points."
4,NICE SURPRISE,"This little, quiet movie has a charming, melancholy soul, and it has subtle things to say about who we love, and why. I found every performance in this movie to be almost heartbreakingly real, and the small, intimate scenes between people to be poignant, and well-observed. Colin Farrell has never been quite as appealing, and his beauty has never been put to better use as a sweet, winsome, soulful boy looking for love, family and happiness. Despite a few movie cliches, this movie surprised me and made me want to see it again, and again. It boasts a delightful soundtrack of chestnuts, atypical and non-commerical, incluidng a few tracks by poet-songstress Laura Nyro, whose own version of her song ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" will have you immediately looking for the soundtrack (it's not on it; you'll need to get her one of her own CD collections, which are easy enough to find). Enjoy, and make sure you've got a Kleenex handy!"
2,Does the story NO justice,"I saw this movie twice. The first time I didn't like it at all. Then I read the book (which is EXCELLENT) so I decided to give the movie another try. Collin Farrell captured Bobby's character very well, but without reading the book you wouldn't know this. The movie could have been done so much better, it gave absolutely no insight to these characters. Each one, Jonathan, Bobby, Clare and Alice are so complex as are their relationships with one another. The movie doesn't show this at all. Alice, one of my favorite characters in the book comes off totally different in the movie. It's so hard to establish these things in a movie, but this was a very poor attempt."
5,home is where the heart is,"I loved this movie. I'm not going to say that it isn't flawed, because every great thing is, but what's good about this movie more than makes up for it. It's hard to say what the plot of this movie is because it's complex, and most of it is character-based. What draws you into the movie, what hooks you is Bobby's character. He's somebody that sees the ""big, beautiful noisy world"" that he inhabits, that spread his love so easily and is terrified of being alone. Bobby is played perfectly by Colin Farrell. You almost forget that Farrell is notoriously known as being a promiscuous, foul-mouthed smoker and drinker (but yet I'm still a fan. I guess every girl loves a bad boy).I'd write more about the plot, but honestly, I can't really condense it into a few short lines. It's a movie about searching for your home, and the realization that nothing's permanent. This was one of the best movies I've seen all year."
5,What a wonderful Movie!!,"I was so amazed that Colin Farrell could act in such a movie. it was so moving, and he helped make the movie that much better. What a touching story, so real and heartbreaking for him as a child to have so much loss, and experience such confusing times with his very best friend. In the end it resulted in him becoming this wonderful loving, caring adult that you can't help but love. I cried at the end for his character the most, with Clare and Rebecca gone, and Jonathon ailing, I cried for what would be his life afterwards...... A definite keeper....."
3,Disturbing and beautiful,"I can't give this movie five stars simply because some scenes were just disturbing (while still being total necessary to the film). This is just a classic story of a boy trying to find out where he belongs and what he's supposed to do. Under all the shock value scenes there really is a beautiful love story here. Its not a movie that I would consider a must own, but if its on HBO or something, you should check it out."
4,A little of all of us are here,"I could relate to the comments by reviewer Queequeg below, but if you look past the cliché there is a lot to this movie.Remember 'just loving' your best friend in high school or college? Then you met Mr/Ms Right. Now friendship, love, and sex are all mixed up and you don't even realize it at first. You wake up one morning with the things you wanted, but now you question was this really the goal? The story demonstrates that appropriate decisions make us better, but sometimes sadder.This is one of the few movies I can see multiple times. I was very surprised to find Colin Firth more dimensional that the sex crazed fool of ""People"" magazine articles."
1,"Terribly Dated, Disappointing Melodrama","Yet another movie where the gay man ends up sexless and alone, finds a KS spot, and dies of AIDS.The novel was good, but in a distinctly 1990's sort of way. Now this material seems outdated, mundane, and depressing.Other than that, Colin Farrell is surprisingly good (for a change) but the script is so flowery that one never once believes these are real people in real situations. These are just literary characters, moving down a well-trodden path towards a predictible conclusion.""More atmosphere than plot and more character-driven than story, A Home at the End of the World never manages to engage viewers. It keeps the audience at arm's length throughout, never letting us get inside the mind of two of the characters, and the motivations of the third are so paper-thin and apparent that the tremendous amount of time devoted to backstory is unwarranted."""
2,bleh,"It had an interesting story but I can't for the life of me figure out the relationship between these people. Why do they love each other? It's like they meet...and they're in love. That's it. None of them are likeable. Unless they're all just high on drugs, which they are, and everything is always happy and good and there's love love love everywhere. I didn't enjoy it."
4,Fascinating and entertaining,What really defines a family? This movie explores a modern day family. I was not expecting much of the movie due to the lead male role but surprisingly it was well done.
4,amazing,surprisingly. charming. I wanted to see this movie since long time ago. I like the way gay theme is considered.
2,Farrel Zombie,"Is Collin playing a half-wit or the most sensitive bi-sexual in the world? This is pure melodrama and moves slowly. The chick likes gay men. That's her problem I guess. There's not enough here to get a full punch.Sissy steals this show as a woman that will bake and accept her son's teen gay lover on the turn of a dime. Guess they're not taking a girl to the Prom.Dyed Red hair, is that supposed to be cutting edge?"
3,Do NOT read the book FIRST!,"The storyline veers dramatically off the book, which happens to be my favorite book - if you have not read it, please do, you will fall in love with the characters.Regarding the movie, Farrell's portrayal was the only one who was able to even get some of the emotional attraction that his character in the book has with readers. Though, it took about halfway through the film for this to begin happening.When I first bought the movie, it was shortly after I read the book and I hated it. I only watched the first hour then shut it off because much of the film is different than the actual story. Though after I few months, I decided to watch the film again, and did not have the book as fresh in my mind, and I really enjoyed it. There are still considerable flaws with the film. Poor casting in some roles, most in fact, and the director and character's fail to allow viewers to fall in love with them, though the movie is entertaining and worth watching."
2,The design rubs off as soon as you lace up your shoes,"I love cute shoelaces, but these are cheap and even the red background is printed on the laces and rubs off on my shoes."
4,me gusto,muy bonitos tenis y a un buen precio y aparte me ahorre el pago del impuesto que me hubiera costado en una tienda local---
1,NOT HAPPY WITH THE QUALITIY,"I DONT KNOW IF ARE THINGS OF MINE, BUT I HAVE MORE THAN 5 YEARS USING THIS STYLE,ADIDAS SAMOA, SO I THINK THIS SNEAKERS FROM THIS STORE ITS NO GENUINE 'CAUSE THE ""LEATHER"" ITS TOO HARD, BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS BLACK UNIT I HAD BOUGHT A WHITE ONE TO AMAZON STORE AND THOSE IF SEEMS TO BE GENUINE, LEATHER ITS VERY SOFT, BUYERS TAKE CARE WHO YOU BUY"
3,Adidas Samoa (black),"It's a great shoe with a great design. Feels comfortable over all, however the front of the shoe rubs on the top of my big toe and has caused a blister of sorts. I believe this is due to the design of the shoe being somewhat restricted in the front with little room for my toes to feel comfortable which ends up with the top of the shoe rubbing on it constantly after a long days work. This causes mild comfort issues and if I could return it I would (problem came about after 4-5 day usage)."
3,"Love ADIDAS, not the Samoa","I bought these thinking that they were like the ADIDAS Superstar, which in my opinion is superior to the Samoa, which I know is a very popular shoe.The outside of the shoe seems thin and flimsy, compared to the thicker leather of the Superstar.I am sure that this is a very fine shoe, but for my money, I prefer the style and quality of the ADIDAS Superstar."
3,Good Shoes,"These shoes are ultra comfy and good priced but if you are going to wear these shoes in hot weather, it's best to go sockless or wear some very thin socks, because they make my feet hot and it has not even been over 100 degrees yet!"
4,Great shoe.,I have about 8 pair of sneakers that I wear on certain occasions with one pair I wear daily. This shoe is now the daily pair. Great comfort and style.
5,gracias,"todo bien gracias, rápido, excelente, vendedor buena la oferta espero volver a comprales otra ves sin mas nada que decir."
5,Can this be shipped to the UK by paying extra for postage?,It's a very comfy adidas. i love the way it grips on my feet. Looks fashionable too. I wonder if it can be shipped to UK when pay extra for postage?
5,Christmas gift.,"My 20 year old son picked these. He thought the price was decent & the shoe was hot. He loves them, they look good on his feet. Would use seller again. I received these quickly, way sooner than i expected with regular shipping. I was happily impressed because these didn't fall under the ""prime"" shipping category. Thumbs way up to the seller!"
3,Typical Range War Novel,"The story of Radigan seems like it has been copied from others and not written nearly as well. L'Amour often gives us Range War's, but this one is just too predictable. A new cattle outfit, headed by a woman, tries to overrun and kill Radigan and his sidekick. Their purpose is to steal his range. The problem is that they do not know how to winter cattle on this type of range. Their timing is poor and they end up getting in big trouble. Radigan tried to warn them but they just would not listen. Of course, there is another female involved. It seems that her part of the story never really got very developed. The book is a quick and easy read, so still worth sitting down with."
3,Decent,"I liked the song ""What'd You Come Here For?"" so much that I broke my rule and bought the CD without having heard any of the other songs. I'm not disappointed. ""Joanne"" is a nice dance cut -- sassy lyrics. Being a true old school junkie, I was skeptical about their remake of Patrice Rushen's classic slow jam ""Settle for My Love"". T&T did a nice job with it. Kinda funky. A couple of the fast songs sound alike to me, but overall the CD has some nice dance cuts, a decent slow jam or two. It's worth the money just for the main cut, ""What'd You Come Here For?"""
5,delightful and insightful,"Who doesn't like Dvorak's powerful and heart stirring music. This book tries to show the same impact the man made on his family, colleagues and friends. Each chapter could stand on its own,with the characters voicing their thoughts and feelings about Dvorak in their own unique way, both in style and in feeling. I thought the novel expressed the overall feeling of a man of great humanity, humility and almost too ordinary to pay much attention to, while at the same time celebrating his genius. A subtle and insightful novel."
1,poor packaging,"This product came . Not packaged well at all.The top was off. All the cocoa was in the box all over the place. Hardly had any left. It was not cheap. With the shipping and handling. It should have been taped across the top,also placed in a zip lock bag.just in case it did break open You would lose nothing. It would be in the zip lock.Hope to be reinbursed for this product that I purchased. And could not use. Better packaging needed.Thank you."
4,This book is a gift for you and those you care about,"This is one of those books that you can pick up and flip to any page and find something soothing, inspirational and practical. In years past I used it almost like a sleeping pill. I would be riled up about some situation and inevitably, Jampolsky's simplistic, rational, truthful words would reach my heart and calm me to sleep.All I can say for sure is that my life works better when I apply the philosophies of this book. It's extremely simple to follow yet so profound. I find it goes right to the heart of the matter."
5,What a life changer!,"A friend of mine advised me to read his book when I was down and out, lost all hope, and was beginning to feel that the world is just a bitter place full of people desperate to take advantage of each other. As you can tell from some of the reviews for this book, there are people like that (because they live in fear) but this book taught me that there is so much more! When we are afraid, we see the world as such a hostile place and are never able to open up and appreciate the beauty of life. We become aggressive, defensive, and disrespectful of many things. When we let go of that fear, we are able to embrace the beauty of everything and everyone despite the flaws they have. The authors of this book explain this very nicely but there is another book that explains this exquisitely! It is a book called ""The Ever-Transcending Spirit"" by Toru Sato and it is an absolute must read as well! If you are ready to let go of fear, this book will be a life changer!"
4,Get off the emotional hamster wheel. Why am I reliving the same mistakes?,"If you want to emotionally 'flip the light on', then this is the book for you. Once I realized that we're dealing with Love and Fear, and that alone, life became so much more simple. I have choices. Period. Highly recommend."
3,Fear and Love,"When I first learnt that the opposite of Love is Fear, I thought why hadn't I been informed of this as a child. Our world has got it all wrong! If only everyone knew that we are all coming from a base of fear and that as we let it go, slowly our love can start to flourish. This book illustrates so well and clearly how fear is holding us all back. We may not like to relate to it this way, but think about it. It is only fear that stops us from being who we were meant to be. Jampolsky's lessons taken from A Course In Miracles are written in a way that everyone can understand. Whereas ACIM is challenging and for many people off putting. Everyone should read this book, it will change your whole perspective of life.Dr Gunta Krumins-Caldwell author of On Silver Wings"
5,This Book Changed My Life,"I was extremely depressed and about to lose a good relationship when I encountered this book. I read it, studied it, and saved my relationship. Now, my wife and I have been married 4 years strong and have an 18-month old son!Go for it."
2,Love and fear,"Simplistic but an ok entree to the subject. To anyone who is beyond a bare bones beginner, keep looking."
3,Skeptical,"A Course in Miracles is my only skeptical part of this book. I do not know this program, but from the evidence I get in the book..I doubt its background in Jesus Christ. But don't quote me for sure. I can say I enjoyed reading this book, it makes sense. It was uplighting and inspiring. Worth the read but be cautious of cult practice."
1,love is letting go of fear,"Dr. Jampolsky, as do so many others, seem to believe love is an emotion. I think it is a choice, which lends itself to many emotions. Dr. Jampolsky if love is an emotions is it a matter of choice or something that you simply feel?"
2,"okay story, but wrong version!","The movie description was great, the story was great, cinematography, acting were all fine, HOWEVER when i received the product there was a big sticker saying ""R-rated version."" Nowhere in the product description or seller info was it suggested that any other version was being sold. I've purchased other titles by Wicked which were as described (and NC-17). Beware of the seller and version."
2,false advertisement,this movie description does not say cable version but when i got the movie it had a big gold cable version sticker on it
3,Fallen,The movie itself was descent. When I got it in the mail it had a cable edition sticker on it. I wasn't aware that it was the cable version but I still appreciated the movie itself.
2,Simple softcore...,Received DVD in good condition. Simple story line with a few scenes of ladies in their birthday suits. wish there were more explicit scenes of Jenna.
2,BS,It says he splooges in her mouth but the is not the case. this is the softcore version. My wife and I were totally disapointed. waist of money.
2,Original Artists But Not Original Hit Recordings,"You get 30 selections on three discs. This is not much of a bargain, as many country reissues have 15 to 20 cuts per disc. Unfortunately. only two of the 30 cuts are the original hit recordings. The remainder are ""new stereo recordings performed by the original artist."" The singers are not well served by these new recordings in terms of both engineering and musicians. Too much irritating echo overlays many of the cuts. And the accompanying musicians are not always the great sideman on the original recordings. Save your money and seek out the original recordings."
2,Older Book,"I was hoping this book would have been a little more up to date. It gives some basics, but I would not buy it again."
3,Some good writing...,"...but a little disappointing! I heard about this book on NPR. One small segment was read over the air. It was well-written and very evocative of the region described.However, the format of the book is the disappointing feature...I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, but it wasn't a dictionary! And not all the writing lives up to the standard of the author whose paragraph was read to us."
2,It's Just a Dictionary,"It's just a dictionary of landscape terms. There are a FEW crude black and white illustrations in the book - NO COLOR, NO ARTWORK LIKE THE COVER. If you like reading dictionaries then this book might work for you. It's sort of like a historic dictionary, coffee table book on landscape trems with no photos. Some of the definitions are well written. Some of the words have interesting, not to be forgotten histories. That is the value of this book. But I'm not sure what to do with this book. Perhaps it will end up in the pum pile."
2,Home Ground,"I bought the book,but am sorry I bought it.Maybe I'm overeducated for this book,having taken courses in Geography,Geology and History.I read little that was new to me.For someone less knowledgeable,it could be interesting.The format is easy to use and the descriptions are easy to follow.But I was not inspired and as I indicated am sorry."
5,Great product - my dog really benefits,This product has certainly helped maintain my dog's digestive tract in good health as he matured - and I plan to keep him on this supplement indefinitely.
1,Prozyme,I ordered Prozyme for my Greyhound because I read on various veterinary websites that this product would help with gas as well as prevent my dog from eating her stool. I received the product and used as directed and my dog wound touch her food when this product was on it so I feel it was a waste of money.
1,Not a replacement for Enzyme Miracle,"I purchased this item when I ran out of Enzyme Miracle for my dog. It had great reviews and was much more reasonable. Well, its not very reasonable if you can't use it. I ended up having to purchase more Enzyme Miracle and trashing this, which also put me in a bind because I had to wait for the second order without anything.I used the Enzyme Miracle for about six months now and never had an issue with my dogs getting sick even while switching them to a raw diet.Enzyme Miracle is expensive, but apparently worth every penny because when I switched to this product, my dog immediately started vomiting up every meal. I scrapped the small amount of the EM I had left out last night and no vomit.Apparently, he does not like the taste, or everything the Prozyme is lacking compared to the EM is exactly what he needed.I wouldn't purchase this if you are looking for a replacement product. Its apparently not a comparable quality."
1,Very slow,Product arrived after due date - I had to go out and buy another bottle from somewhere else because I couldn't wait. Very disappointed.
5,Stretch yourself into a better nights sleep!,"Yoga is a healing, nurturing way you can change how your body feels. There are also many benefits for the mind. When I am relaxed my mind does not run a mile a minute.While listening to the easy to follow cues you will be creating a peaceful setting for sleep. This tape should be listened to at night when you can reap the benefits or in the morning if you feel too stiff to get out of bed. (That may be a sign to get a new one.)The first time I practiced this yoga tape in the afternoon and was so relaxed, I fell asleep at the end. I awoke and was completely refreshed like I had never felt before.If you like this tape I also recommend Dr. Weil's new soundbody/soundmind to use as you fall asleep. You will then have stretched your cares away and received a massage for the mind. Take this tape with you when you travel to get to sleep more easily.~The Rebecca Review"
5,One of the decade's best albums.,"I saw Bruce play at a concert back in April, and after hearing ""What a Time,"" ""Fields of Gray"" and ""Tide Will Rise"" for the first time I knew I had to get the CD right away. It didn't leave my player for weeks afterward. The album is poppy, jazzy, funky, rocking, and slow and beautiful by turns. It puts pictures in my head of long spring nights and special friends. There isn't a clunker anywhere on the record either: I've listened to it dozens of times and still never want to skip a single track. This is definitely one of the best CDs I've picked up in the last several years."
5,Easily Hornsby's best,"While most of his other albums have been winners, and all have been solid, I count ""Harbor Lights"" as the pinnacle of Bruce Hornsby's career. The liner notes say that HL was recorded at his house, as basically an extended jam session, and as such it comes much closer to the energy and beauty of his live performances than any of his other albums. While all of his albums have the jazz piano which made him famous, this one's got the most soul.The title track, ""China Doll,"" ""Fields of Gray,"" and ""Pastures of Plenty"" are the sort of songs it's dangerous to drive while listening to: you just want to close your eyes and slip away into his music. ""The Tide Will Rise"" is one of his most inspirational songs ever, with its quiet celebration of the passage of life as seen by Virginia fishermen. I don't think there's a song on this album I dislike, which is a rarity for me. All in all, highly recommended."
3,Same ol' Bruce Hornsby,"I purchased this CD because I read a review stating that this is the freshest Bruce Hornsby yet.Ho Hum... It's the same old thing. Sounds exactly like the old Bruce Hornsby and the Range stuff. I liked ""Spider Fingers"" much, much more.Although I like Bruce, I think he needs to progress. This is the same ol' stuff."
4,Album does not get tiresome,"About the time this album came out, I saw Hornsby at Chastain Park in Atlanta. Show was magnificent. The album, which I bought after the show, is one that I come back to again and again. Seems that many records today are throw-aways: listen once, and that's enough. Hornsby's material has staying power. Bruce also has, like many artists, a social message, as in ""Talk of the Town,"" about a mixed-race couple. Don't let any political bias stop you from getting this album. It's solid."
4,Take me home... Bruce,"Anytime a Bruce Hornsby song comes on the radio be prepared to drift away to another place. It has been my obersavation that everyone I talked to agreee with the fact that Bruce Hornsby's music takes you to another place, whether it be that summer when you had your first ""steady"" or back home whether home may be. ""Harbor Lights"" is not one of Bruce's best album but can he top ""the way it is"" its pretty tuff. ""Harbor Lights"" I believe has alittle more of a Jazz influence. At some points in the album I think it would have been better for Bruce just to play instead of sing. But none the less, another great album by Bruce Hornsby. Just too bad its not with the Range."
5,masterpiece,I first bought this CD back in 1995 and i had to replace it just recently because I played the first one so much. This album is definetly one-of-a-kind. Each song has its own little story in it. It is a musical experience you will never forget. Buy this CD.
2,"It's ok, but Bop It Extreme 2 is MUCH more fun","I bought this for my 8yr old, thinking it was the next step after Bop It; i was disappointed, as well as my son....it is much more difficult, the ball falls on the floor and gets dirty after a while (especially if you're not the neatest housekeeper in the world! LOL), and there isn't really much to the game, so it gets boring quick.....I then bought Bop It Extreme 2 and my son was delighted....much more fun!"
3,Top It?? I say Drop It!!,"You know (especially parents)that you get a toy for your kid(s)that everyone thinks is cool.And you think it's kind of dumb and you think ""Why on earth did I get this?!"".Then you give it to them and at first they play with it day and night!Well,everthing is going swell until day 2.Then it is all over.It is in the toy box for the next 5years until the next yard sale.I think this is that kind of toy.If you want a junky toy sitting in the toy box forever.GET THIS TOY."
3,Only has a few games,"While this toy is very fun when you first get it, it really only has three games in it. You have to play them in order. When you miss, you have to start again from the first game. So when you have mastered game number one, and you move on to game number two and miss, you have to play game number one again. Then, there are only three games and you get the commands memorized in no time and then the game is no fun anymore. Why can't it be random like the game Simon? This would be much more fun."
2,His son tries hard to make a compelling case for Atlantis,"There is no new material in here about Atlantic other than what has been lying around for a few thousand years and folktales among new agers. So it's dad who proves the history in his readings of those imprinted in one way or another by their lives in Atlantis. No archeology, no stuff to look at or touch or hear about for the first time. The three islands went down over millennia, and nothing of the civilization has surfaced that he knows of although he trie to work backward from the people and folkways and religions of those scattered around in the Americas and down Egypt way. The epileptic prose is hard to engage with."
2,Second hand information,"This was not actually written by Cayce, but summarizes some of his thoughts on the subject. The copy I got was very yellowed and fragile. I was disappointed with not only the condition, more importantly the content. Don't bother with this book. I threw mine in the trash."
3,Interesting but not too exciting,"This was a detailed report on most if not all of Cayce's visions of Atlantis, and there are more then you think. Cayce tells details of Atlantis life and basically everything we have now, they had and more. It was pretty interesting although a bit slow in places as some visions repeat themselves in parts."
2,Not the best for someone with a crummy chem professor.,You are better off with YouTube videos if you need chemistry help. It isn't awful but it didn't really help me.
3,Not the book for just jumping in,"This book is not the type of book you want to just ""jump in"". I bought this the summer before I actually took my chemistry class in High school. Currently I am taking the class, but in the summer when I bought this book, the book made no sense whatsoever. Now when i flip through the book it makes sense, but if you looking for a preview of chemistry I don't think this is the right book. Anyways chemistry is easy....well for me atleast."
4,It is great for basic knowledge,"I am not big on the whole ""for Dummies"" thing, However chemistry is NOT my strong point. I felt this book allowed me to get a basic grasp at the foundation needed to understand chemistry."
5,Joke gift for my chemist brother-in-law,"I bought this as a joke for my brother-in-law (chemist) because he made fun of my ""Art for Dummies"" book. When he unwrapped it, he hooted b/c he thought it was so funny. But then he flipped thru it and saw that it really covered the most important topics in chemistry. His 17-yr old son will probably borrow it for a chemistry class this fall. In the meantime, my bro-in-law will display it prominently in his office to make his co-workers worry about his competence : )"
4,Easy do it yourselfer!,"I needed this book for my nursing entrance exam, it was for sure worth every penny!"
3,OK but not the best,"I have seen this company provide better books. This book was not so clear and detailed as other dummie books. Study your text book, use your Ti-84 calculator ad ask your local college professor for help. You'll do fine without this book."
4,Very Helpful,"When learning chemistry for the first time I found this book very useful. It is a great reference tool for anyone learning basic chemistry and a valuable book for students learning chemistry for the first time, or past students that need to revise basic chemistry concepts. If you need an easy to understand basic reference guide to chemistry, this is your book."
3,Chem help,Helps clear up some things in addition to my txt book. It was worth the money I spent on it.
1,Unacceptable,The tables are all messed up if you read this book via kindle. I'm not happy at all! I want a refund!!
2,"Good, but kind of fluffy","Whether or not you should buy this book really depends on what you need it for.If you're interested in learning more about how chemistry is used in everyday life, this book is excellent. It does a very good job of explaining how chemistry is used in a variety of consumer and industrial situations. This is an interesting book in this sense, and very complete.However, if you're taking a chemistry class, this is not such a good book. The explanations of chemical topics are a little fluffy, and certainly not what anybody would consider complete. While well-written and lively, it's just not ""chemical"" enough to give the serious student any real help when studying.My conclusion: If you're looking for a fun book about chemistry, buy this one. If you're a student who needs help, go elsewhere."
4,Read before you take chemistry 101.,"I bought this book as a supplement to my Chemistry 101 textbook. I was really looking for a more complete explanation of electron configuration, which I didn't find this book to be that helpful with. Overall, I thought this book helped to reinforce some of the basic concepts, but didn't really have much of an impact on my grade. I would recommend this book to someone who wants an overview of chemistry before taking the course or to someone who needs to brush up on basic chemistry before taking a more advanced course. It can also be helpful if you're having trouble with a particular topic. I did enjoy the supplemental information in the book having to do with chemistry of everyday life."
1,ok.,"Thought I would need this when I took Chemistry, but I maybe looked at it once and it wasn't the most helpful."
3,Runs Huge!,"This shoe was so cute. I heard it ran big so I ordered a size 5 1/2 instead of 6. Unfortunately, they were still huge! Keds used to run TTS but, unfortunately, this seems not to be the case anymore. Too bad, because they are so cute."
4,Weeds,"I purchased this book as a companion to another field guide, Wildflowers. I've never been able to differentiate between weeds and wildflowers, but after perusing both works, I've determined that my yard has far more weeds than wildflowers.This is a handy reference with good illustrations and text written for the non-botanist to understand."
4,"Fun to read, not so easy to ID with","This is an enjoyable book for kids and adults, with lively commentary and good descriptions of where you're likely to find these plants.There are several downsides: a) I can't really identify much from this book; I don't find the illustrations helpful. Smartweeds, for example, are not shown with their common purple splotch. ""Weeds of the Northeast"" is far better for identification, especially when you are dealing with seedlings. b) Some common weeds like garlic mustard and yellow foxtail are not included. Maybe it's time for a revision, since the copyright reads 1987.Once I ID a weed, though, it's always fun to pull out this book and read what they have to say about it. For this reason - and its reasonable cost - I recommmend it."
2,Rather weak,"As a spot check, I tried to look up several of the weeds in my yard. I couldn't find ""creeping charlie"" or ""birdfoot trefoil"", which are quite common around here. The ""common plantain"" in my yard looks nothing like the plantain illustration in the book."
2,Limited use,"Very limited use. It seems to show weeds that basically look like flowers. If you're looking for common back yard pest weeds, this isn't the book."
5,Just right,The Golden Guide is just what I wanted. Not to small and not to large. Compact enough to carry in your back pocket as you go through your yard. Illustrations are life like and detailed. Easy to read even for the younger kids. Not alot of large words you don't understand. Seems some of my grass is actually weeds.
4,"Cute book, helpful, but tiny size","I enjoyed this book and found it helpful and educational. I think the price is so inexpensive, compared with other books, because it is so small. It is approximately 5 inches by 6 inches in size. This is not a huge problem (no pun intended), but with a small book, you can't fit in as much information / content. Over all, I am happy that i purchased this book. I will not be buying a more expensive book as this suits my needs as an amateur / novice gardener."
4,Smokin's weeds book..,"""Smokin"" is in ""really cool"" that is..Lots of full color pictures and good quality drawings that help identify various weeds. For landscaping and gardening/farming purposes its great. If you are looking for wild edibles, this book doesn't go into edibles or other uses for the weeds, just identification and some general information. Pick up one of Thayer's book on wild edibles as a companion to this."
4,2nd time around,"I first had a copy of this field guide when I was groundskeeping at a University. I didn't know the various thistles, much less how to treat or eradicate them. With a name to start out with, I could get the job done. These days, I volunteer at Parks, most of which, due to budget cuts, are really hurting in the weed department. So, some I now know. Some I have no idea. You learn as you go along. I want this book along with me, to be that first critical step in ID. The rest of the info is all on the Internet anyways. I do wish there were more species. I do like the range maps included, so as you can figure if it's likely that you have a given weed in front of you or not.Molly McCarty"
5,One Man Dog - history at it's best.,"This was one of my very first albums. I love it as much today as I did way back then. A relaxing, laid back James sings some wonderful little songs."
5,One of his best,"I never tire of listening to this music. One the record, Side 2 is basically one large work, each song transitioning to the next. The variety of musical styles illustrate the depth and range of James Taylor's composition and performance genius."
2,"Excellent book, poor leader's guide","""The Jesus I Never Knew"" is an excellent book, one which I was so excited for my class to study. However, the Leader's Guide and Participant's Guide (which is to accompany it) are both overly simplistic and totally skim the meat of the chapters. I have had to write my own questions for my group and restructure the entire lesson based upon each chapter in the book. If you want to study this book in a group setting, I recommend skipping the added expense of the two ""guides"", and just ""winging it""."
3,Cindy Says Women's Earth Sandal,"Quality leather sandals however, I would recommend ordering these shoes 1/2 size larger than your regular size as I found that they run quite small."
2,Only 40 prints instead of 100!,"When I buy the ink & paper combo - I can get 100 to 120 4x6 prints, since I already had plenty of paper, I bought this expecting to get as many prints. After only 40 prints, I got the dreaded ""low ink"" warning. Never Again!"
1,SELLER ERROR......FAIL~!~!~!~!,"Ink and print paper ""look"" great, however, after waiting 2 weeks for the printer to arrive and had not yet received I contacted them. Now I am told that the item is no longer in stock....then I receive a 2nd email stating the item is discontinued....tell me then how could they sell me an item that didn't even exist to begin with~! Story gets better, instead of shipping my order in one shipment they ship me the cartridge AND photo print paper first of which I received promptly. BUT what GOOD does that do me NOW when I don't even HAVE the printer that I purchased and will NEVER receive it~!~! I am livid~! :["
3,HP 110 Tri-Color ink Cartridge,It does what it's supposed to do. While HP is a good manufacturer ink jet cartridges are not the best choice for a printer.
1,Not much ink,These ink cartridges have not much ink in them and only printed a few pictures. I was very disappointed. Please use caution on what company you are ordering these from.
5,Thank you Amazon,"This the only place I could find this without the photo paper. I went to other others but it was not available without the photo pape, however, Amazon made it possible and the ink works perfectly. Amazon is my favorite place to shop."
5,Outstanding prints and great service from Amazon.,I have an HP Photosmart A646 compact printer which my wife and I use to print our family pictures and I ordered the replacement cartridge (HP 110) because Amazon does have the lowest price that I could find for it. Amazon has never failed to deliver any item that I have ordered from them so my order arrived in a few days (we are Amazon Prime Members so shipping was free).The HP 110 cartridge was installed very easily but we were only able to print 53 pictures using the highest settings on HP Premium 4x6 paper.I did read other reviewers who changed the print settings but my wife and I like to print from a flash drive or SD card so I am not sure if that can be done from the printer itself. The cartridge we received was a regular retail HP box so it is not a refill or other OEM brand.I only purchase from Amazon as they offer the lowerst prices as compared to local retail stores.
3,Quality but no quantity,"This is a nice product and it does create excellent quality prints but unless you print on the lowest quality you don't get many prints out of this cartridge. I have an HP A616 Photo Printer and get about 24 4x6 pictures per cartridge on the highest print quality setting, when you factor in the cost of paper that is over a dollar a print which is much too high to pay for normal printing. Home photo printers are good if you need to print a picture on the fly but not for average photo printing needs."
3,Beutiful pictures,"Great quality ink that drys fast, but doesn't last long. especially when one color goes out and the others are fine, you still have to replace it all for $20."
2,Too expensive,"Bought this as a gift, can't give a real review but I will say that these cartridges are too expensive for what you get out of them."
3,Prints great photos if you can get a cartridge that's not defective.,"This color ink cartridge prints excellent photos if you're lucky enough topurchase one that isn't defective. Often the metal contract strip isdefective and the photo printer delivers the bad news. Taken straight fromthe package, handled and inserted properly and it's a defective metal contact strip. It must be a common problem as I've had no problems returning cartridges to stores."
2,Sucker bait,Why not just run down to Wal-Mart for your picture processing? It's cheaper and the prints are just as good. HP is ripping off the customer like forever.
2,Misleading Photo,"The ad showed a picture of a genuine HP110 Tri-color Injet Print Cartridge box. Instead I received a remanufactured compatible cartridge. I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet. So, I do not know the quality. OC Inkjet should be forthcoming about that."
3,New cartridge needed two cleaning cycles before using,"Perhaps this is normal with any new ink cartridge, but when I received this, the first print was lousy...and this was AFTER my printer did its automatic alignment procedure.So, I ran the cartridge through a couple cleaning cycles until prints started looking good. This means wasted ink and wasted photo paper...just to get a NEW cartridge printing the way it should.So, whatever anyone tells you is the expected number of photos you will get from this cartridge, keep in mind that the number will be decreased if your new ink cartridge requires this out-of-the-box cleaning."
4,HP INK IS THE BEST,I am not fond of having to spend money in ink for my printers. It really gets expensive and out of hand. Ink costs more than the printers these days. If you have to buy ink then I would recommend you having an HP printer so you can use their cartridges. I find that they last the longest and are top quality. I can honestly say I have never had a problem with any HP product....so go for the ink and spend your hard earned dollars wisely.
5,Great worship CD!!,I love this CD and so do my kids! It's wonderful! I listen to it all the time. I'm afraid I will wear it out!
5,Excellent CD!,"WOW Worship is a wonderful cd. Shout to the Lord and many other beautiful worship songs, fill me up daily. I suggest this cd to anyone looking to strengthen their relationship with Christ. This is definitely one of my favorites."
2,Stick with the Hymns,I find the songs in my church being replaced with these praise songs. I find that they have much less meaning that the old hymns that tell the stories or Jesus and the Bible. These songs seem more shallow.. something that should not be sung in church. I can't stand the sound of the songs because a lot of them sound the same to me. STICK WITH THE TIMELESS HYMNS!!!
5,All the Best Worship Songs on one album.,"Within these two CD's you will find the most powerful worship songs. All the best songs that you love to sing are right in this album. This is definitely the best worship CD you can buy. If you need spiritual uplifting or just want to sing praises to our Lord, then this is the CD for you!"
4,Great CD!,"This is a awesome CD. I bought it because it had a lot of my favorite praise and worship songs that I couldn't find anywhere else. The only thing I don't like is that the songs lack closeness of a church group. I love singing with my youth group, but I can't get the same feeling from this CD. The songs are great, and I would recommend buying it, but don't except to get the same feeling of singing with your church groups."
3,Good But...,This is an average album in my mind. The major problem with it is that I think that it has to many of the older songs on it and less of the new. I would vote it four stars if it were more of an even blend. Many of the songs on it are very good though. If you enjoy worship music I think that you will like this album.
4,What a wonderful book!,"I read about this book in an article. So i decided to check it out. Well i thought the book was so wonderful and enlighting. You got envolved with the characters and there story line. For all you who love tear-jerkers this book has it,but thats not what the book is about. It really opened my mind and made me see things a little different.No matter what race you are it will make u think a little different. The main theme is a girl whos white and jewish and a boy who black. They run with a momnet and end up falling in love. I think everyone will love this book.Its hard to put it down once you get going. I really enjoyed reading this and i think u will too. It really touched me!"
3,DWAYNE SHEPHERD REVIEW,"I liked this book because it is really down to earth and it has parts that i never even would think about .This book also show a lot of family together time it also show a lot of friendship.I love the part when him and his mom are talking in the kicehen talkingabout life and how life as been to them and how fun it have been. life to me have also been fun. I love when jeremiah and elisha bump into each other in the hallway.This is a sad but good book and if you like tragity and romance and good books this book will be good for you and you will love this book more than ever.All I want to say is to just read this book ''Please''Please, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE"
4,My Review,"I chose this book to read for my 9th grade english class as an assignment. This book was very descriptive, everyone in the story keeps it real. I also enjoyd this book because many young adults can relate to this book because it's about ""young love"". The author made you feel as if you were there. As the story goeson you start to get attached o the book and just can't put it down. My favorie part was the ending. you would never guess what happen. This book would be good to read for young adults, or for someone who is secretly in love. I give this book four stars"
3,If You Come Softly,This one deserved a 3.5. It was your average interracial teen romance. It was Save the Last Dance without the dancing.Ellie is 15 and Jewish. Jeremiah is 15 and black. His parents make him go to a fancy prep school in Manhattan where he meets Ellie. It's love at first sight. They can't get each other off their minds. I'd say more but I might ruin it for ya.
3,Nice Love Story,"This is a nice love story, but I just couldn't get into it. It didn't seem to have a real point to it. I mean, obviously it was about the problems that an interracial couple face. But, it was a little too short to actually get into. The end was good....sad...but good. Overall, I would reccomend this book to someone who likes somewhat short stories and doesn't want to be reading the same book for a long time."
5,"Excellent writing and plot, and very believable characters.","If You Come Softly is an excellent book. It describes the powerful feelings of love, and the sad shape this world is in. I would recommend it to anyone. Jacqueline Woodson is a great writer."
5,IF YOU COME SOFTLY by: Jacqueline Woodson,I really enjoyed reading IF YOU COME SOFTLY. I would recommend it to anyone interested in a easy fun reading. This book was an easy read for me because it grabbed my attention and kept me wanting more and more. The story it self was very moving. This book has a very tragic ending. I really liked If you come soflty and feel like anyone would really enjoy it.
4,If You Come Softly,"The book If You Come Softly is a brillian work written by Jacqueline Woodson that tells a very unique story about an interracial frienship turned romance. The story is a modern day Romeo and Juliet. The main characters are fifteen year old Miah, a black boy and Ellie, a white girl. They are both new in a Manhattan prep school. They immediatly click and eventually fall in love. Society has a real problem with this issue, even more so than their own families. They receive strange stares and harsh glances while holding hands and kissing in public. They decide to stay together through all the negative feedback and lean on each other through many problems they face in their own lives. The characters develop emotionally with each new experience they have as a bi-racial couple. Just like Romeo and Juliet however, things don't end up well for the young couple."
5,Excellent,"I loved this book! What a magnificent ending! Although I found the characters slightly confusing I would encourage anyone to read this book. Pick up this book not only to read it, but to behold it's emotion. Yeah, it may lay out a tale of an ordinary teenage love, but you'll be turning pages until the bitter end. The bond and trust that grows between Miah and Ellie make you feel like it's really you within the book. I would especially recommend this book to any teenage girl, it will take you to a beautiful place away from this crazy world. No, I can't say this is the bestest book in the whole wide world but it's surely an excellent story to expose yourself to."
2,Was it worth it?,"I am going to be a senior in high school this fall and in the midst of my summer reading list, I decided to pick out a book for pleasure. If You Come Softly caught my eye, mainly because I like books I can relate to and I had been in an interracial relationship my freshman year. However, I was very disappointed. As you read this book, try to find the climax. was it when they kissed? Said I love you? I dont believe their ever was a true climax. And what about towards the end? What I feel that the the author intened to be the climax was like, 2 pages. I quick up and down. Maybe my reading level was that above what the book was intended for, but I think Ms. Woodson needs to work a little harder, it was a good attempt though, but not enough to keep me reading."
3,It was okay-- you should read this book,"I like this book because Jeremiah and Ellie have a good relationship. The way they started having a good relationship is because at school they were holding each other hands. Then as it got further in the book they started kissing.Then they were also skipping school to go to Central Park and spend time with each other. Miah was also introducing his family to Ellie.The reason why I don't like the book is because at the end of the book, the police thought Miah was the man they were looking for so they shot Maih and he was alive for a while. Then after he thought about Ellie and his family, he fell right out and died."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"I had to read this book for a project in Language Arts. My teacher suggested this book because my topic was integration. When I started the book, I didn't really love the details. Each chapter seemed to be a repeat of what happened in the chapter before. Then I got to the ending. I thought the book was bad enough, but Jacqueline Woodson had to REALLY ruin it. She ended it with killing Jeremiah for NO REASON. Thats the worst way to end a book-by killing the main character."
3,Great Book... Except.....,"This was a great book. Its a story of when a Jewish girl meets a black boy and have a relationship together. It was really good, but keep in mind that when Miah's(the black boy)father says to him ""never run in he park"". He says that when he is really young. Then when Miah is 15, he is walking through the park and is really happy and decides to run through the park. This was the first time he ever ran in the park, and the police shoot him. That was the WORST ending I have ever read in my life! It was the worst ending to a good book. So if the things in this book were real, then I would get shot by the police if I ran through the park because I was black? Thats really dumb....."
5,Stephani's If You Come Softly Book Review,"If you come softly is a great read for a teenage girl.This novel was really great but a sence of sadness went with it.It is a realistic fiction novel. It's about love and it's hardships.Ellie and Miah fall in love but are of different races, now that doesn't sound like a crime does it? The two main charaters are so deep in love but their relationship isn't aproved by others because of their different races.I recommend this novel because the plotline flows smoothly and teenagers can relate to it."
1,torn,"If you don't buy this movie, which you shouldn't, it may be put in a time capsule as a representative element of our current culture. please read the other 1-star review for more detailed advice, thanks."
4,Horror fan,I am a horror buff so I watch everything from the genre I can get my hands on. This is a solid indie release that I have turned on to several my my friends.
3,we should be able to listen to all the songs instead of 5.,"The song by Inoj is real nice but the rest is alright. It doesn't really make me want to go out and buy the third one, because I only liked 1 out of what 5. At least if I had heard a little more then..."
3,book review,"the thing that i dislike about this book is that it starts out slow their is nothing good about it at the beginning then the part that i like about it is that duff pringle goes on a road trip to sanjose, california and he has to be at his job in 3 weeks and he blows his engine"
4,Great for those lazy beach days....,"Jeanne DuPrau combines mystery, comedy and romance to pull off a wonderfully captivating book. The characters are hilariously realistic and get themselves into all sorts of unimaginable predicaments, some of which involve con artists and vomiting cats. The plot, although slightly predictable, moves along at a clipped pace, keeping you involved from start to satisfying finish. This is a wonderful book to read while you're out lazing on the beach this summer."
5,A great book,"This is a good easy read book. I am a big fan of Mrs. Duprau's other books,and was excited when this one was released. The guy in the book reminds me a lot of me, so that was pretty cool :)"
2,past it,"As an original ELP fan, I really wanted to like this album. It says it was recorded live on the 1997 'World Tour'. Tracks are: 1. karn evil 9 (actually 1st impression Pt 2) 2. Tiger in a Spotlight 3. Hoedown 4. Touch and Go 5. Knife Edge 6. Bitches Crystal 7. Honky Tonk Train Blues 8. Take a Pebble 9. Lucky Man 10. Fanfare etc./Blue Rondo 11. 21st Century Schizoid Man/AmericaSadly, Keith E and Greg L announce their failing powers all too clearly. Greg Lake employs the usual tricks - like avoiding sustained high notes - or sustained low notes, come to that - and sounds..well, fat, and Keith E substitutes speed in his 'improvisations' for creativity and accuracy. Only Carl P comes out of it with credibility intact (I have seen him live recently, and can testify to his continuing dynamism). The sound quality is OK, but nothing special. Overall, this recording adds nothing good to the originals, neither does the 'live' dimension. Oh, it hurts to have to write this."
4,He's done it again,"I was sold on James Cobb and his Amanda Garrett when I read Choosers of the Slain. We've got another Hornblower and this time she wears a skirt but has the multifaceted character and inner insecurity that made Hornblower such a wonderful character.I'm also a fan of techno war stories and this one is great. In all too many cases I find myself saying, ""Noooo! It don't work that way,"" but Cobb has both his tactical and technical ducks in a row.The only jarring part is that a part of this universe is an effective and forceful UN. I've worked with the striped pants brigade too often to have much hope that things would work this way in real life."
3,A slight disappointment...,"As an avid reader of Amanda Garretts previous sorties I found this too be somewhat lacking. Or perhaps it had that little bit too much. The long-winded telling of the backstory, which although necessary given the relative obscurity of the area, seemed to me to take away from the book more than to add to it. If they had been slightly briefer this book would be up there with the first two, and now Target Lock, as it is it doesn't quite make it. It is an enjoyable read, but I do miss the Duke, but many of the new characters of the SeaFighters help to make up for this. I loved the Little Pigs Logo/Beret!"
5,Great military adventure,"Another fine military adventure story in the same series as _Choosers of the Slain_ and _Sea Strike_.The destroyer Cunningham doesn't return in this story, but Commander Garrett and her surfer-girl intel officer are assigned to a UN mission off of West Africa.As in the previous books, some interesting technology is used in cool ways, in a good story line. Definitely recommended!"
4,"Good story, realistic plot! 1","This is a change from the first two books in this series. The story vividly brings out the tensions of UN ""peacekeeping"" mission constraints. It pays tribute to the traditions of the ""brown water"" navy of Vietnam. I do recommend this for entertaining reading! I look forward to the next book in this series!"
5,Looking for love in all the wrong places,"This is one of the most profound books I've ever read. For women who find themselves abruptly abandoned by a man and can't understand why, this book will certainly help them understand this sad sickness in men who as children were never loved by their parents in a healthy way and who compensate as adults by seducing, then dumping the women with whom they form relationships.This book is a classic and should be read by all women who find themselves attracted to bad boys, boy toys, pretty boys, womanizers and men who cannot express their true feelings ...or simply are too numb to feel anything at all except confusion and/or hatred for women.Thank you Peter Trachtenberg.Somebody please reprint this book!"
1,Do not order from Perfumania,"Great product (I would have given 5 stars), but....I ordered the 3.4 oz perfume from Perfumania.com, got the confirmation email from Amazon that said I paid for a 3.4 oz bottle, but received a 1.7 oz instead (for the same price that I paid for the 3.4 oz). I contacted Perfumania by email same day to ask if they would give me a partial refund or have another 1.7 oz bottle sent; I never heard back from them. Is it that hard to click ""reply"" or to dial 10 numbers on a phone to please a customer? I will never do business with Perfumania again and have recommended everyone I know to never purchase from them. I am filing a dispute with my credit union as well; maybe that will get their attention. Worst shopping experience I've had with Amazon."
3,Your scent defines you,I like this perfume for it's casual and perfect for office or daytime use. It wouldn't be the right choice for a nice romantic dinner. Also you can't smell it after a couple of hours. You might want to carry a small size in your purse for longer effect.
5,Deliciously Perfect,I bought this for my grandchildren to give to their mother at Christmas.They were happy and excited and my daughter loved it and had been wanting some Be Delicious for some time. It smelled so nice on her. Shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition. Thank You!!!
3,Be Delicious,"Nice, fresh, fruity scent. Reminescent of a fresh green apple orchard. Great for daytime wear because it is light and fresh. Negative side was it is not long lasting at all. I would say 2-4 hours tops."
5,Wonderful,"This is my favorite scent, I have a hard time finding something that goes with me, I have used this perfume for years and hope it never goes off the market.I received my product faster than estimated which was wonderful since I was all out! Great company to order from. Very happy customer."
1,Scent shortlived,"I'm sorry but this is one of the worst perfumes. I seriously can spray myself about 10 times and within 30 minutes you can't smell a thing. yes the scent is great, I love it. But the only person who has the opportunity to smell it is me. Really really disapointed. I guess I'm just used to the Channel and Ralph Lauren lines. They are quality and can last most of the day. This stuff is plan old junk like most of the new stuff coming out these days."
4,"Fresco, limpio.","Es un perfume casual, con un aroma suave y sutil que al final se siento un poco cítrico. Lo recomiendo aquellas personas que no les guste llamar mucho la atención."
4,Smells Mmm Mmm MMM good!,"One of my favorite perfumes. This is constantly in my work bag, as its a light citrus-y floral scent and my co-workers constantly compliment it! For the evenings out I mix it with Playboy's Lovely, layer it up my legs, and it lasts a little longer that way. =)"
3,Dissapointed...like cheap body spray.,"When I first smelled a sample of this, my first thought was ""HAVE TO HAVE IT"". I rushed out and bought this a couple of days later. First of all, the scent goes away like in 1 hour or less. I just got sick of it and out of my entire fragrance collection this is at the bottom of my list. The scent is also TOO fruity, like cheap body spray. I once smelled it on someone else and thought it was way too overpowering. It is a bad version of Cool Waters (Davidoff)."
5,Me encanta,"esa fue la expresion de mi esposa cuando se lo regale, huele muy bien y la hace sentir mas erotica y sexy"
4,Nice for summer and someone young,Smells fresh and slightly fruity but not cloying at all. Since I generally dislike fruity perfumes that was a plus. Nice enough but not heart stopping. I don't think I'll buy it again.
5,Surprisingly Seductive!,"i bought this at sephora on the advice of another reviewer. it definitely delivers! beautiful smell that lasts all day long.=)it is the real deal in sugar sweet, miles ahead of the jessica simpson line.worth every penny=)"
2,"I Love the Scent & the Bottle Design, But the Scent just Doesn't Last at All....","This perfume has a strong, clean, very fresh, & delicious apple scent, & who wouldn't like such a cute & unusual bottle, but somehow, the scent just doesn't last for than more than a min. or 2 on both myself & my clothes.... (I've read about this particular kind of problem in some other review sites, also....) Even inexpensive Calgon body mists lasts for hrs. & hrs. on me, but this expensive scent just doesn't seem to.... (As a matter of fact, this fragrance seems to have 1 of the most fast disappearing scent that I've ever encountered in my 30+ yrs. in life....) What a shame...."
2,Trouble with the sprayer,I like the smell of this fragrance very much but have trouble with the sprayer mister. Maybe i just have a defective one but I need to unscrew the top and dab it on.
5,Very good EDP,"This EDP is delicious, just like the name.It's fine to wear every day, and you don't get tired of the smell."
5,Perfect parfum,"Its a kind of flowers, rough smeeling to use at the nightJust at the night because it's a strong parfum. Fast Shipment"
5,My wife loved it!,"I bought my wife this perfume and she loved it. It's not too strong, just right. She has others too but this one is one of her favorites."
1,this is not the real one - fake,"yesterday I recived my ""be delicous"" and is FAKE!!!I'm so sad... I bought this from Venezuela, it said ""sold and shipped from amazon"" and I was wating for something real! and it's not!I'm so disappointed!"
4,Fruity & Delicious,"Fruity & Delicious- was my first opinion. I never thought I would like a fruity scent like this one, but i did love it. It lasted really long on me the first day i tried it. Havent been feeling it to last as well now that I use it everyday(perhaps I am used to the smell now?)Thats why a star is missing, but overall, like the perfume. Looks cute too!"
3,Nice scent,I love fragrances from Donna Karan but this one I was hoping would have been more fruity! I did like it but not enough to buy it again.
4,Nice,this product is good price and love the fraguance nice and relaxin for a woman I would it again love it
2,DKNY Be Delicious - Poor,"I like the scent, but it was packed very poorly, no carton, just a wrapper, so it would not be good to give as a gift. The spray shoots out liquid, not a fine spray - there is a lot of waste and unless you put it on your wrist, it would wet your hair if you sprayed behind your ears. All in all never again, would buy over the counter and get a decent package and a non faulty spray."
1,MINE WAS FAKE,"I was completely desappointed when I got this parfum. Anyone could see that was fake, the bottle was so diferent.. and the scent didnt smell the same. Its being a while I got this, but only now I started shopping on amazon again and I thought this review would be helpful."
3,"Interesting, although very biased","This book isn't so much Edgar Cayce on reincarnation as it is Noel Langley on reincarnation, with occasional refernces to Cayce. The conviction with which Langley tries to ""prove"" that reincarnation is, in fact, a Christian view is kind of scary. All of his examples of the plot to bury reincarantion in the bible seem to involve ""evil women"" of some sort or another; quite a turn off for me. I skipped over most of that. Otherwise, it's full of pretty interesting first-hand accounts."
4,"""Don't read this book if you're not ready to have some of your basic beliefs questioned""",Very thought provoking. I liked the way these observations were presented.Couldn't wait to get to the next page.
4,nice shoes,"these shoes are nice for the little one to get around in, I love that the bottom of the shoe is flexible"
4,Nice looking shoes...,"These look pretty nice, but I had to return them as I realized that the velcro ones are more useful. I barely have time to slip the shoes on while the baby is trying to get out and move :)So I bought the ones with velcro instead.The shoes themselves look very nice, but I noticed that they are a little narrow, so think about getting W or XW maybe."
4,A Blank Space,"This is the second time I have purchased this CD.the music is exceptional and I would have given it5 stars, except both of my CDs have a blank space shortlyinto the first track. I purchased the second one becauseI thought it was an error in the recording. Now I don'tknow. maybe it is supposed to be there. Can anyone tell me."
5,Reckoning Night is awesome... Unia is not.,"I agree with the other 5-star reviews on Sonata Arctica's Reckoning Night album. If you're looking for another Sonata Arctica album that is just as good, don't waste your time with the intolerable ""Unia"" on which there are only a couple good songs. Most all of the songs on ""Reckoning Night"" are worthy of repetitive listening.If you like Sonata Artica ""Reckoning Night"", try any Kamelot CD.Particularly ""The Black Halo"", ""Karma"", ""Epica"", or ""The Fourth Legacy"""
5,Melodic metal,"Best album this group has produced so far. Previous albums were good, but in this one, every song is special. Specifically, ""White Pearl, Black Oceans"" is amazing. When you want to relax and listen to something different, this fills the bill. Not for your hard core power metal fans. Rivals ""Nightwish"" albums."
5,Instructions...,Just set your CD player to repeat and let it go.This is one of those few CDs you never get tired of!
4,Great album!,"This is a great, solid piece of power metal. ""Blinded No More"" is a little weak, but the rest of the album is simple, good, melodic metal."
4,real good but not extraordinare,I like it but not as much as i thought.Can anybody tell me is the 1st song suppose to start stop and then continue?I think my cd is damaged in this 1st song.I bought a Neil Morse cd that was damaged and they replaced it via his web site
2,THIS IS NOT SONATA ARCTICA!!!!,I first introduce in metal with sonata arctica AN EXCLELLENT ALBUM!!!now i'm hearing old school black metal but sonata is one of my favourite power metal bands but saddly this cd sucks it's horrible it's NOT SONATA ARCTICA!!!please return to your past and make some good music like in the past!!!!!
2,I Reckon(ing) They're Out of Ideas,"It seems alot of Euro power metal bands that started off promisingly have quickly run aground. bands like Nocturnal Rites and Edguy have taken to treading the same tired waters, having seemingly lost the spark of their earlier albums. Add Sonata Arctica to that list. If anything, SA lost a step with this release, which sounds completely uninspired. They were showing signs of fatigue on their previous album (Winterheart's Guild) but it at least kept pace w/ the first 2 albums. If you're a total SA fanboy, you'll be fine with this album, but if you're an older power metal fan who's tired of hearing bands just re-make the same album every year, this is definitely not the one for you; i'd recommend trying Dragonforce instead (no, they're not all that original either, but they play with 100% more balls and conviction than what you'll hear on Reckoning Night)"
5,Great toy!!!!,"This is a very heavy and durable toy. I was impressed. I haven't given it to my niece yet, but am excited as it will likely last many years and provide tons of entertainment for many children. But probably need to be careful with children who throw things!!!!"
2,"Scholarly, but had to put it away","This book is WAY too detailed for what I thought would be enjoyable reading--""social history"" in the title to me implied more of day-to-day life under the swastika, but I instead found myself wading through more than enough detail to fill a university-level course. While the work is exceptionally informative, it nonetheless is NOT intended for casual perusal. And once I found myself scanning rather than reading, I knew it was time to put it away--at least for now.What I did finish is no secret to anyone: not everything was as it seemed under Nazi rule--ordinary Germans still gave aid to domestic ""enemies"", highly visible social structures such as the churches were not silent on the issues, and the volk did not speak with one voice. Aycoberry just went overboard (for everyday readers) in describing it all."
2,"Please dont' play it again, Donald...","Cape Breton Road is a book that could have been a masterpiece of literature. Instead, it turned into a mind-numbing repetitive description of woods and water. Count, if you can, how many times he uses the same descriptive words for trees and cold. The book comes more alive in the description of Innis' painful feelings of love for the unattainable Claire. As for the ending, it reminds me of the gimmick sometimes used by film makers. You supply the ending. Worse, the author didn't know how to end his book."
1,Poor ending killed it for me,"I found this to be a decent story up to the end. Would Innis get off Cape Breton? What would come of the love triangle between him, his uncle and his uncle's girlfriend. The ending did not answer these and left me disappointed."
2,CAPE BRETON ROAD Review,"I didn't like this novel.My father came from Cape Breton - he was born in Louisburg, NS. I bought the book in search of insights into the Cape Breton Scotch (yes, ""Scotch,"" the same as the whiskey, which is what the Canadian Scots-descent people were called). Instead, I found the story of a modern-day profound loser, deported from the States for stealing cars for joy rides, which he proceeded to do again in the little Cape Breton village where he found work. The novel ends with a disastrous low-speed attack of the car by an angry moose, a sudden back-up escape attempt, and immobility in a ditch.The next events - arrest by the Mounties, trial, and jail, are left to the reader's imagination.D. F. Morrison"
1,thumbs down,"The description given on the back cover sounded intriguing but the book reads like a teenage soap opera written by a randy young man whose goals in life are limited to getting high and stealing cars. The only reason I kept reading was in hopes that this fellow might be inspired by place and become a decent human being. The reason I didn't like this book isn't because the fellow never did see the error of his ways, it is because the nice details about the nature and inhabitants of Nova Scotia got lost in the silly details about a 19-year old's hormones and wonders of pot. What a bore."
2,A real disappointment,"Deported to Cape Breton to live with his mean-spirited uncle, Innis might leave his pot-smoking, weed-growing, car-stealing days behind him as he comes to appreciate hard work and simpler ways. But no, he becomes obsessed with his uncle's girlfriend, and there is no redemption for any of them, three losers to the end. Meanwhile, some very interesting characters are left undeveloped. The writing is very good, both in setting the scenes and developing tension, but ultimatly, this is just not a good story and is a slow read. Want to sample Cape Breton life? Try Alister MacLeod's Island"
3,"Great writing, but ultimately a letdown.","I was totally enraptured by this novel about a 19-year-old boy ousted from the U.S. for stealing cars, and sent back to the place of his birth, Cape Breton Island, Canada. I was enraptured, that is, until the end when everything fell apart. It was an interesting tale about Innis, who just wanted to raise a small crop of weed in the woods and then make enough money from the sale of that weed to enable him to escape the confines of the island. Of course, along the way, he meets some wonderful characters, who teach him the value of the old-time ways. The end just didn't feel right to me, with Innis taking a giant leap backwards after all the believable little steps he had taken forward."
5,Excellent coverage of a complex topic,"A well-rounded treatment of Snort and IDS in general. The refresher on packet structure is welcome and necessary. While there is a lot of good free material on Snort out on the net, this book is a positive addition to the library for anyone who works with intrusion detection systems, specifically Snort."
5,Excellent!,Managing Security with Snort and IDS Tools is just a great book.Don't even try to use Snort without reading this book first.
2,Nothing new,"At first glance, one sees this book and thinks, ""what ELSE can posssibly be written about Callas?"" Follow your instincts! The cover is beautiful, but inside offers nothing new, with the exception of an evil ""friend"" readers may not previously have read about (a woman named Vasso). This author does NOT ""refute"" with any relevant information, that Callas and Onasis did not have a child who died. For the reader who is venturing into the world of Maria Callas for the first time, this is not really a recommended read, as you will not get complete accuracy, and will not find anything you couldn't find in any other Callas book. For Callas officianados, it is a waste of time."
4,Another fine effort from Anne Edwards,"Not having read any biographies on Maria Callas before, I can't judge against other authors' works on the subjects. ...I really enjoyed this version of Callas' work and art. I will second the ... opinion ... of Anne Edwards omitting dates/years when recounting major events--it did make it difficult to place these events in their proper context/chronology.However, overall I found the book's emphasis on Callas personal life as well as her artistic life to make for a very well-balanced view. I would recommend it to anyone interested not only in opera, but in the life of a great legend! One other shortcoming would be Edwards' lack of attention to the details of Callas' performances--this is not a technical look at her voice, but a general overview of her unique gifts of displaying real emotion through her voice and gestures, both on the stage and in the recording studio.Viva La Divina..."
4,Not bad,"I'd disagree with those here who ... this book. Actually it's about as good as any one-volume Callas bio available. Its focus is very much on the person, not the artist. And Edwards has an irritating habit of not giving years with dates, so that chronology is sometimes hard to follow. But on the whole I found this book consistently interesting and well researched."
2,Subpar,"Edwards' bio of Callas borders too much on the tabloidish side, hardly on her career. Certain sections reads like she was pulling an alnighter in writing it, and the last two pages had serious editing problems. Try Callas works by John Ardoin, Henry Wisneski and Michael Scott"
2,A big disappoitment,"This new biography on Callas is in my very personal opinion a complete disaster. It does not ad anything important or even new to the well known story of the sopranos life , maybe thats because that was not the idea behind the book, however the reason why I decided to buy it in the first place was because in this book the author would be presenting us with a theory that completely refutes the story that appeared on a recent book about a secret child that Callas probably had with Onassis.I have to say that Edwards theory does not hold a single drop of water concerning the secret child story.The book gets at times boring and confusing nevertheless I am giving it two stars for the authors effort , but if you are on the look for an interesting book on Callas life this is probably not it."
2,Be Sure This is Not a Compilation of Ms.Wilson's Best,"Don't get fooled by the misleading CD title. This compilation is unfortunately limited to the Sony/Columbia output. The great singer with the great arrangers and the great musicians and the Great American Songbook has unfortunately gone lost in the past. Though her voice, vibrato, and general perfect are still superb, the repertoire is widely skipable."
3,"The singer, not the song.","Like her equally talented '60s contemporaries Barbra Streisand and Morgana King, Nancy Wilson quickly turned her back on stunning interpretations of American standards to become a purveyor of tepid romantic schmaltz. This is the ""best"" of Wilson's '80s-'90s schmaltz - acceptable pop/R&B-lite in the Anita Baker vein. It's easy and pleasant listening, and that great, intelligent voice is still there, richer than ever. But one can't help but wish the lady would return to her roots and offer up some wise takes on more classic material."
4,What Can I Say? Nancy is a True Diva,"We can argue back and forth until the cows come home about what should be considered Nancy Wilson's best material. But whether you love her music from a generation ago, or whether you can vibe with her soulful, sophisticated material from more recent years, this true diva never disappoints her fans. This is a good compilation of music which gives a nice sampling of Nancy Wilson from across the decades. I will always be partial to the way that Nancy tells her story in my favorite song, ""Guess Who I Saw Today"". For fans of Nancy Wilson and even for those who are just being introduced to the vocal stylings of this true diva, this is certainly a compilation worth adding to your collection."
4,Sheer Elegance,"""Hello like before"" was my introduction to Nancy and from that song there was no turning back. This Greatest Hits Collection was a big wake up call as to the dynamic voice that is Nancy Wilson. Her songs are like butter and I have never regretted buying this album simply for the song that got me searching high and low to discover who the artist was.I recommend this CD wholeheartedly. If a bit timid try the Album ""If I had My Way"" and I promise you, your next purchase of Nancy's will definitely be this collection.Nancy knows Jazz and from all indications she probalby wrote a few of its chapters."
4,Great Overview of Reformed Thought,"Not only does this book introduce the reader to the history of Reformed theology, but it also gives great explanations of each segment. In my opinion, the two best chapters are Herman Dooyeweerd in North America by C.T. McIntire and Cornelius Van Til by Wesley Roberts. Although short, the chapter on Van Til gives a very good explanation of his epistemology and methodology."
2,Not for every vehicle.,"I bought this for my 2005 Jeep. After talking with the Audiovox help line, I found out that it is not designed to work with ""coil pack"" distributorless ignition systems like mine. I wish this info was in the literature so I could have found out before purchase. In fact, the person I talked to said it's only for 1995 and older vehicles. I'm shure it can be adapted for some newer vehicles, but if you have a ""coil pack"" instead of a distributor, don't bother. You'll spend more time trying to find out how to get it to work than it's worth."
3,looks good but can not install,i both this about a month a go and i can not find no body to install this in my 93 corolla... i have try my self but is npot working... if you do not understand about electric of mechanic you can not do nit!!! will return the product soon!!! thanks
4,1992 Geo Metro Convertible with cruise control,I installed this item on my 1992 Geo Metro convertible. I took my time and read all of the instructions included. It wasn't that hard to install. I did add the vacuum canister since it is a 3cyl. engine. I did call the customer service a couple of times and they were very helpful. The system works great and it was worth every penny!!
2,Cruise control,The item didn't work because of the year of my vehicle (2005 Frontier). the ad seemed to imply it would work or at least that's how I interpeted it. Fortunately someone had a earlier model Frontier that bought it from me so I didn't have to return it (just luck I guess). What the manufactuer needs to do is state that 2005 Frontiers and later are not candidagtes for after market cruise controls.
5,Audiovox CCS100 Universal Vacuum Cruise Control,"Audiovox CCS100 Universal Vacuum Cruise Control was purchased through Amazon. Less than other web sites, less than store price. Had issues in making item function. Called Audiovox tech. He was very helpful and complete in description for the problems I was having. As was installing on an old 68 Mustang model that has some modifications. Tech knew exactly what to do to correct. Then road tested. Satisfactory tested. Took on trip in Colorado, Road speed of car in cruise does not vary more than 2 mph up hill or down. Terrific software, naturaly good in is equal to good out. Pulse from drive shaft is great feedback. As the After market coil is not compatible with Audiovox CCS 100. Have brite led lites for brake lite turnsignal. Not compatible with Audiovox either. Tech on phone knew all about these items and corrected over phone."
5,"Takes a little work, but worth it!!","I installed this cruise control in a Honda ST1100 motorcycle about 2 years ago. It worked perfectly right from the start, and I've not had a minute's trouble with it. On a trip to Washington, DC it held my selected speed to within 1 mph, regardless of terrain. The installation took some planning and effort, but was probably more difficult because of the close confines of the motorcycle internals. I think it would have to be much easier to install in an automobile, especially one with good accessability around the engine. Overall, I think this is a great product for the money!"
4,Works as stated,The cruise kit needs newer instructions to make installing on newer cars easier but if you can find the vehicle speed sensor wire and tach wire your good to go.
1,ccs 100 woes,Unit has no updated info beyond year 95. May work great but no info you can't install. Audiovox website no help! Sent back for refund.
1,Audiovox CCS100 Universal Cruise control,These have been discontinued and I am trying to locate a magnet kit for mine. The magnet kits are no longer available from any source. Interested in purchasing a magnet kit for the CCS100.
5,Audiovox ccs-100,this cruise control will work on a motorcycle also. i used it on a 2005 honda vtx 1800R and it works great just google the dip switch set up for your bike and someone will have the setup for you.
2,not dependable unit,"I have had to replace the unit the first time w/in the 12 month warranty. They handled it very well and a whole new unit was sent which I installed the ""computer"" unit only. It died again w/in the year. I had a repair shop check it out and the speed control unit is not working properly and the wiring etc. was correct."
5,Excellent product,"I feel this is the best value for the money I've ever seen. Quality, simplicity, works very well. Requires some ability to install. Highly recommend."
5,look ma no hands!,"this thing is wonderfull,installed on a 20002 connie.Did 2500 miles 4 days and gave me so much freedom from the throttle.Easy to in stall to.two thumbs up!"
5,"According to Audiovox - ""This product is no longer in production""","****Update****Wow, you almost never see a ""Discontinued"" product come back, in this caseit's just smart business on thier part for start back production of thisgreat little cruise control.I've had this cruise control on my Yamaha FJR1300 since 2009, it's workedflawlessly in that time. Installation was ""Moderate"" on the difficultylevel but then what's easy to install on a motorcycle?It's definitely worth the trouble.***End Update***Get one now before they discontinue it again.Don't wait for Amazon or anyone to get this back in stock, if someone has onein hand - buy it.Audiovox has stated the following:""The factory that manufactured these for us went out of business and we couldnot find a replacement. This is no longer in production and parts are no longeravailable.""Thank you for using Audiovox.Customer Service"
4,Adaptable Cruise Control,"Installed on 85 BMW K100RS. This unit is great, electronic cruise on and older bike. You have to have some mechanical skills to pull this one off but its well worth the effort. Unit is safe and will disengage with either brake, clutch or the unit off switch. Holds your speed up or down hills with a max variance of about 3 MPH. Finding a place to mount the components is the biggest challenge."
3,did not tell me it wont work in a motorhome,"When I first got it home I was feeling good about it, read the directions and it did not seem to hard, but After I get everything apart and ready to install I found out that it won't work on a large motorhome, so that sucked. There was nothing anywhere in the box or online that warned me of this fact. I only found out after I called the 800 info #. I will be trying it on a different vehicle, then I will give it a rating, bottom line."
4,Cruise in an old CVPI,Installed this successfully in a retired police cruiser. 2003 Ford Crown Vic.No problems for my needs.On hills I sometimes have to give it a little foot pressure but no big deal. For best results some recommend adding a vacuum tank.Fairly robust: My dog pulled it out of the dash and I was able to keep using it (with a few teeth marks and a few crimp connectors)
3,1995 Jeep Wrangler YJ--Poor Instructions,"This unit works great and is worth the money once you spend the time to figure out how to install it. Don't expect much from the horrible generic directions. If you are not the type who can figure things out yourself get someone else to install this unit for you. I am pretty adept at installing electronics into vehicles as I worked at an electronic store installing car stereos. Read the instructions a few times over before starting and you will save time and frustration. The rest is really up to you to find out where to splice into the necessary wires in your vehicle. Grab a multimeter and start testing. It really is a pain in the neck to install due to the generic directions, but it is manageable if you are the type that doesn't mind spending some extra time and is willing to figure out how to install it in your particular car."
2,Probably a great product...if you could install it,"I assume that the product would work well once it was installed. However, installation is difficult and you may need an expert's advice more than once to be able to install it. I am returning mine after toiling for hours to try and install it. I assume it works well and give the product 4 stars...but because of the old instructions and difficult installation, only two stars overall."
5,Reliable Printing,If you are looking for a reliable network printer with a fair amount of features for a small office this is it. We currently have 8-10 people that use this printer daily yet we never had we had a problem with it. I added the duplex tray for some heavy duty print jobs. It went in flawlessly and worked perfect. If your doing heavy volume printing you might want something a little more zippy but if your doing your average office workload this is perfect. Did I mention it supports internet printing. So print to it from home.
5,A kick-butt book about chakras and spiritual healing.,"I never thought ""spiritual healing"" and ""kick butt"" could be used in the same sentence, but that's exactly what this owner's manual does. Or should I say -- kicks first chakra! Ms. McLaren states that she has learned all she knows about chakras directly from the chakras themselves, and has never read a book about the chakra system. Well, I must have read them all, and even the best ones left me with a sneaking suspicion that everyone owns an aura and chakras except me! ""The Owner's Manual"" demonstrated to my great relief that this is not the case. Ms. McLaren provides even the most spiritually stupefied like myself with accessible tools with which to tune into our subtle energies, heal ourselves, take control of our lives, and have fun in the process. I endorse her book with gratitude."
4,Your Aura and Your Chakras,In this book I learned a lot about releasing old thoughts and breaking unconsciously made vows and agreements. I would wake up in the middle of the night and early morning breaking them. This was a great way for me to release alot of baggage in a quick effective way. The only criticism I have of the book is that it seemed like the author had some heavy opinions about life that could have been left out.
3,heavily opinionated and with a attitute that feels condescending,"the techniques are originally from the Berkley psychic Institute. The book called, ""The psychic healing book"" has most of them as well without the heavy energy and rule based judgments from Karla. The cover, feels as disjointed and un-integrated as its author. Lots of useful material though and compiled in a useful format. I didn't find any flow to the writing or much warmth,and I really wanted to find out why i was so irritated by her writing. For all the health of the material, it felt off. I know the author disowned all the material as useless, and perhaps did not feel totally behind it whilst writing it."
3,Your aura & Your Chakras,"Interesting approach to the chakras theory. The book has to find some audience for being perceived fully. Not for me, so. I am a little dissapointed. Imaginary furnished room in my head is not for my way of thinking. Although I am sure some would find it relevant."
2,not what i was lookinh for,"I thought this book would be a basic run down on auras and charkas. I bought it to combat books like these. Wondering if they were creating oppositte adverse effects. It wasnt the straitforward understanding of auras chakras i was looking for. But handled special issues and practices. Exercises i didnt follow, and things like building rooms in your head and giving flowers. This may be good for some people but not what i was looking for. Then i have a sense of guilt when i try to renig the item. Im sorry."
2,50/50,"I have a two line Panasonic cordless phone system that is several years old. Recently, the handsets starting losing connection with the base station and the batteries were not holding a charge.I bought two Energizer NiMH batteries, one for each handset. Replaced batteries and left the phones charging overnight.One battery worked fine, the other one only got hot. In other words, one of my brand new battery packs was defective. It would not even power up the phone display.If you decide to buy these batteries, my suggestion is you retain the packaging until you are certain they work. Me, I threw out the trash immediately, so I really have nothing except the dead battery. Maybe I should see if Amazon will exchange it anyway.BTW - I swapped batteries back and forth between the two handsets, and also tried charging on both the base station and on the external charger. So this is definitive -- the battery was clearly defective brand new out of the box."

2,Soundtrack? Where is the actual soundtrack?,"Why does this thing include only 6 songs only? Come on, Legend of Zelda, Twilight Princess has some of the best music from a videogame EVER! And yet we can't find any music for it....for shame.....other than that, other than the price, the set is good."
5,Go to Target,"I also found this item at Target for $39.99. If you buy it at amazon or ebay, your wasting your money."
4,I admit it...,"...I didn't realize that Imagineering was going to be exclusively based on the Disney theme parks. I was... well, more than a little disappointed when I opened it up and looked for the many illustrations and stuff about the making of the movies, that I confess I thought would be there. The book in itself was nicely put together, and DOES look attractive, in terms of what was in there. I can clearly see why anyone would greatly enjoy it. Nevertheless, in my case it sits collecting dust on my shelf.I blame myself: I should have looked just a little deeper in what the book was going to be about, before purchasing it. A technical explanation of the process of the theme parks' creation was... uh, boring. *laugh*"
2,Not a Lot of Meat Here,"This is just a PR piece for the Disney company, a way to build hype so more people will buy their products and see their shows. I was hoping for some nuts & bolts advice on designing theme parks and theme park rides. Everybody knows how to brainstorm; everybody knows the importance of color and lighting and music; everybody models on computers before they make physical models. What do Imagineers do that's different? Do they have special techniques for brainstorming, or for choosing colors, or stage lighting? The answers are not here. Also, what have Imagineers learned from their mistakes? If you take this book at face value, Imagineers have never made mistakes; everything they've done is perfect, and any criticism leveled at Walt Disney world was later retracted or countered."
5,Great book,"Saw this amazing book at Disney World, paid half the price on Amazon.com, my Mom loved it! Great book, love all the background of the creativeness that was behind making WDW."
5,I LOVE This Book!,"I don't normally write reviews, but after receiving this yesterday I can honestly say that I LOVE this book! Amazing. 10 years old, but still so insightful and interesting. Perfect for anyone with a keen interest in the Disney parks."
3,Just okay,"My 14 year old son has dreams of being an imagineer when he grows up. As I was planning our first trip to Disney World, I came across this book, and thought it would be great for him to read through, and get a lot of his questions answered. He reported back to me that he thought the book was a little boring. I looked through it, and I agree with him. It's not as exciting or interesting as I expected it to be. The pictures and illustrations are great, but the information is just not that enlightening."
4,Nice used book in great shape,"this is a great book and the transaction was as expected... on time, in the condition stated and a good price point."
3,"Great pictures, little insight","The illustrations, pictures, etc. are exceptional and make the book worth a serious look. The big disappointment is the lack of true insight into the real design process behind the parks. Instead we get a superficial retelling of anecdotes from old Imagineers, and a tremendous amount of self-congratulation. Sure, what they do is special--that's why I'm reading the book. I don't need to be reminded of it in every paragraph. Overall, it's worth it, but anyone looking for real insight into the design issues around the parks will be disappointed."
3,"Great photos and anecdotes. Little ""real"" information.","This is a great book for flipping through on a lazy day, but it is not the book you want if your looking for juicy information in Disney's Imagineering activities. But then, there aren't any Disney books, and may never be any, that provide really good ""inside"" info on such topics. But the book is enjoyable via it's use of photos and drawings (most all of which are beautiful) of Disney productions of all types, as well as interesting mini interviews with employees on their reasons and feelings for working at Disney. I recommend this book for those who wish to ""tour"" the Disney history, rather than read about and study it"
3,Great visuals but short on analysis,"Michael Eisner, President of Disney, writes in the introduction that he was initially very much opposed to the concept of a book telling the story of the famous Disney Imagineers.' Well, it shows in the book! The pics are fabulous. You are invited into the Imagineers' visions. As a reader you perch on that precarious tip of the branch were you can see in two directions. Looking backward, you can see enough of the immense leap between nothing in the mind and something in the imagination. Looking forward you can sense the chasm between imagination and embodiment. So the visuals work. But what is missing is the conceptual tools that make the flight of fantasy arrive in the world of bricks and mortar. That part of the story the reader must unravel all by him or herself."
4,Very Informative. A bit too Informative!,"I sort of agree with the other reviewer about this item being boring. But, it is a very informative dvd and if you can take a couple of hours torture, you will learn a lot about T-SQL programming. The quality of sound is quite better than other DVpress products, but could be even better.Over all 3.75 stars for this product which if we round up will give ****"
3,So So,"Even though the plot itself was ok, the script was only so so. Mandie didn't seem as determined to figure out this particular mystery, which seemed out of character. You'd think she'd be extremely worried about Ms. Hope dissapearing. And there wasn't enought friction between Joe and Jonathon. I like it better when there is jealously involved. So if you aren't really into the Mandie Books, this book would be fine for you. But otherwise it isn't worth your time."
3,That's is right,I really agrea with most of the above readers. This book was a disapointment.I thought that questions in the story weren't really answered too.I don't mean to give you the wrong idea the other Mandie books are awsome. It almost seamed as if this book was written in a rush. And they ate chocolate cake on every page and I'm sick of it.
3,it was ok,"This book had no real plot! My other friends thought it was excellent, but I thought it was poorly written. The only reason I give it 3 stars instead of 1 is because even though I am getting a little old for Mandie I am a devoted fan and also because I loved the ending! I was disappointed to hear that Mandie and the Graduation Mystery (Mandie book #40) is going to be the last Mandie book! It comes out September first though and I am definitely going to by it soo look for my review!"
5,Excellent video,"I bought this video thinking that between my toddler and my infant, someone was sure to watch it. I'm trying not to have my 5 month old watch TV so early, but I do play this for my daughter who is 2 1/2 now-- she still loves it! One of the best videos for toddlers out there. Very well made. A baby will like seeing the images, but it's great for a toddler because a soothing voiceover names the seasons and objects and has taught my daughter many words and helped teach about seaons. I can't say enough about this show-- and the puppets even make me chuckle.I would say this tape would interest babies between 6-9 months to 3 years."
5,Great series of videos!!,Forget Baby Einstein. My son smiles a lot more often while watching these videos. I would get nothing done at home if I didn't have it to entertain baby!
5,Just what I wanted,"This is a great video, although probably a little elementary for my 2 yr. old. She enjoyed it for a while, but I'll have it when others come along. Very soothing and fun."
4,Gets better with every listen,"I was a little cool toward this album on the first few listens. As expected, the songwriting was excellent, but the songs (except for the first and last tracks) didn't really grab me. With every subsequent listen, however, I've grown more and more fond of the entire disc. Bruce is without equal in ""country music"" today in creating a mood and surrounding the listener with visual details. Whether you call it country or roots or folk, you have to call it good."
1,It's JUNK!,"Ok gals, unbeknownst to all of us diehard Shaper Plus users...I'm talkin' a customer for 15 years here. Since '09...if you've gotten bum bottles of it, won't spray out, no air pressure, won't hold...it's because the EPA forced Sebastian to change the formula to below 80 VOC's. NO WUNDER IT DUZ'NT WERK! I tried Matrix Total Results Proforma Hairspray...smells weird...but is pretty ok. Nothing, and I've tried SexyBig Hairspray, Brocato Maximum Hold, Kenra 25 Spray, Aqua Net Super hold, and the Matrix is abt as close to the hold Shaper Plus had. You can buy it at Ulta. Good luck---and RETURN your unused product! It'sa RIP OFF! It's not Shaper Plus anymore---it's HALF water."
3,early 90's gem?,"for an early 90's release it is mearly a fair album but the more time that passes, the better the album sounds. repeated listening is a must.only downfall is it sounds a lot like l.o.n.s."
4,organized crime in america,"The author has done an excellent job of presenting a factually accurate yet interesting survey of a subject that has been often written about. This ""textbook"" is reader friendly in that it is at once research based, legally and historically accurate yet an enjoyable read. In different parts of the book, criminological theory is introduced and explained and is then effectively illustrated by case examples. This book is also unique in that it presents chapters on tactical strategies employed by the prosecution and defense attorneys involved in organized crime cases. I look forward to a 4th edition."
2,Not for me,"This pack looked good, but I expected a more padded hip belt for dayhikes. With full hydration bladder and clothes the hip belt was of no use. The shoulder staps did not fit either. Sorry to say I had to return item."
4,works great but gets a little hot,"I do Brazillian ju jutsu with my wife and we got this for her (along with the ear guards) because her hair kept getting pulled. She says that it works great. Obviously, there's no exposed hair to get pulled, but the drawback is that it traps in heat. The material is basically the same stuff as rash guard or those Under Armor stretchy shirts, so I thought it would breathe well, but... I guess not. All in all, she likes it a lot, but she'll usually take it off about half way through a training session to help her cool off."
5,"I have never heard of this thing you call ""music""...","...but I think I like it.I actually have Scratch and Sniff Car Crash, not on CD, not even on cassette, but on friggin VINYL. It's great. There's really a scratch and sniff sticker on the jacket. It smells like asphalt.I also have ""A Frenzy of Music and Action"" but that one IS on CD.Yeah, I like em. I wanna be friends with em.Music theory coming out the whazoo with theses guys."
1,"""700 Miles""","This record sucks. Full of faux emotion and drenched in gravelly vocals, the album is a testament to the '90s' almost complete lack of stylish delivery. Most of the songs were clearly written as acoustic ballads, originally, and then ""pumped up"" with electric guitars and sort of loud drums. Some people just weren't cut out for writing music, but that's the beauty of grunge. It lets everyone try. Don't buy this. Don't listen to it. If you own it, you're either friends with the ""band"", or blessed with a poor taste you find no need to rectify."
4,my lowest rating 7 thumbs up,yeah i copied it from the simpson so what big deal wanna fight about it. i loved this movie but the only special features are deleted scenes and the trailer. and directors commentary. no behind the scenes or commentary by jim carrey. something like that would be great
2,another Carrey movie ...,"This may not be the best of Carrey movies. Like many Carrey movies, this one is a bit strange sometimes; however it can be good entertainment if you look at it in the proper way: just relax if you can, do not think too much etc.. I cannot say I really enjoyed watching it, but it has some good points though : excellent special effects."
4,Good Movie for your all time collection.,Worth the price. Relaxing and enjoying the movie in my home theater. Prompt delivery from Amazon.
3,Peter Greene ( My View),"Sure, this movie was o.k., but I ,myself, like the bad guy in most films. Peter Greene was the high interest in the movie for me. When ""STANELY"" had the mask, basically, it controlled him, but when ""DORIAN"" had the mask, he was in complete control. He got revenge on his boss and anyone else who crossed him, even though it was only for a short time. If there is a sequel, which I doubt, it should definately have him, or a character similar to him. But, Jim Carrey did do a good job, and he is one of my favorite actors, so I guess this movie was pretty good."
2,The Mask - Blu-ray Info,"Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, CAspect ratio: 1.78:1VC-1 BD-25 / Advanced Profile 3Running time: 1:41:12Movie size: 18,71 GBDisc size: 22,67 GBAverage video bit rate: 19.04 MbpsDolby TrueHD Audio English 1573 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 1573 kbps / 16-bit (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbps)Dolby Digital Audio English 640 kbps 5.1 / 48 kHz / 640 kbpsDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby SurroundDolby Digital Audio English 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby SurroundDolby Digital Audio German 192 kbps 2.0 / 48 kHz / 192 kbps / Dolby SurroundSubtitles: English SDH / GermanNumber of chapters: 26#Director's Commentary#Filmaker's Commentary#Return to Edge City (27m:16s)#Cartoon Logic (13m:42s)#Introducing Cameron Diaz (13m:17s)#What Makes Fido Run (10m:50s)#Deleted Scenes2 stars for butchering the transfer with DNR"
3,Good decision to delete unnecesary scenes.,Excelent reproduction on DVD. Nice sound and wonderful image. The assassination of the leader of the mob by Dorian was really violent. For me it was unnecessary. Great perfomance of Jim Carrey.
4,A DvD or this...,"I've got to give this one a mighty shrug since detail, sound or clarity isn't a big thing for a comedy. If it's cheaper on the DvD, go for that and if it's cheaper on the Blu~ ditto."
5,My 3 year totally LOVES THIS MOVIE,"I'm telling you I've never seen a 3 year old little girl love a movie so much! I mean don't get me wrong, she loves her Dora the Explorer, Yo Gabba Gabba, Blues Clues, Mickey & Minnie Mouse & all of that but I don't know what it is about this movie that she loves so much but we have watched the dvd's so much that we are on our 3rd dvd of this movie because she's worn the other ones out LOL she even quotes the movie like ""SMOKIN"" or ""THATS A SPICY A MEATBALL"" or ""LOOK MOM IM ROAD KILL HA HA HA"" LOL It is the funniest & cutest thing."
3,Scratch,I love this movie it is a great film but the version I purchased here was scratched making the watching experience not that enjoyable since at one point I had to take the movie out and clean it to see if that would help. It was straight out of the box. I had the same issue with another movie I purchased. The actual movie I love it!
2,The Mask,The quality sound and picture for this blu-ray version is below zero and I keeped my DVD version with sharper screen better (6.1 DTS) sound.Ofcouse I do not blame you.
4,great,gave it as a present and he loved it! should come in plastic wrap to avoid folding in the shipping process
2,"Too violent, stupid, and the humor in bad taste!","This is a terrible, stupid movie. It is VERY sexist, violent, and one of Jim Carrey's most awful films. It is not for kids, even though I watched it and I saying 'ughh' the whole time. There are way to many gun scenes! It gives people the WRONG message. Save your evening for some other video, not this."
2,Liar Liar was better than this.,"Meet Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey). His Job, he is a bank clerk. When a woman named Tina Carlye (Cameron Diaz) wants to open a bank account at the bank where Stanley Ipkiss works, but doesn't know what account to open. But what he doesn't already know, that she is the girlfriend of a brutal gangster (Peter Greene). But that all changes when Stanley finds a mask, a tells a cop why he was in the water, ""I was justing looking for my mask, I got it."" This movie aslo has Ben Stein as Dr. Neuman who has written a book called, The masks we wear. Watch Liar Liar instead of this."
1,"Silly very Silly, Jim Carrey in my mind can't act","Jim Carrey one of Hollywood's most annyoning players plays the ultimate loser in this rather chidish and yet another uninspired attempt to try to woo an audience. He plays Stanley, a bank clerk, a nice guy who is such pushover that one day he stumbles across a mask belonging to ancient god of who knows what and becomes a macho green guy who tries to imitate Clint Eastwood. The special effects alone is fanatastic but that's the only good thing worth mentioning in this lame film. If JimCarrey continues to go on this self indulgent path to make child like films that see him as an horse's behind he won't be around for a long time to come because people will get sick & tired of seeing his same old antics on the silver screen. Cameroen Diaz as Carrey's love intrest please! she must need the cash badly to take part in a comedy masscare like this. Is Jim Carrey worth $20 Millon per film after seeing this you won't think so anymore."
1,ouch,"this movie is so mid 1990's it hurts. looking back at this, I can see how the cultural fallout of 1997 came about."
2,Typical Jim Carrey,"Jim Carrey likes to be an off-the-wall goofball. This movie is perfect for him.During the day, Carrey gets to be mild-mannered Stanley Ipkiss. A guy so nice that everyone walks all over him. But at night he's The Mask - his inner self. No restraints, no restrictions, everything goes.That would have been fine with me. But this movie has Ipkiss/The Mask committing crimes (bank robbery, assault, breaking out of jail). It also has a lot of smoking. And sadly, the only one who changes is Stanley. He learns to be less inhibited. By donning The Mask, he realizes his nice guy persona is just a mask he wears because he thinks he won't be accepted for who he really is.The Mask would have been a MUCH better movie if they had left the criminal activity out and explored the Mask part a lot more."
4,The Mask - Blu,"I love the movie, for me, this is Jim Carrey's best movie, no doubt. The Blu-Ray looks superb, both audio & video,really enjoyed it. ENJOY !!!"
3,Great combination of live-action with computer animation.,"Being a ""toons"" fan myself I fell in love with this film. Carrey's Stanley Ipkiss, a ""toons"" fan too, gets to live out his ""toon"" fantasies after finding a magic mask.I think Carrey did an excellent job in this film and this was one of the better films he has done where he plays a strange but likeable character. He is a very talented actor who I am glad got the opportunity to show his versatility in this film.This was Cameron Diaz's first film and boy does she do it up right!The DVD has some great goodies and makes a great comedy addition to anyone's collection."
4,Reviewer: Big Zach! NOT A KIDS REVIEW! although a kid!,This is a very good movie. It is one of Jim Carreys best performances. Cameron Diaz (super hot!) was very good in this movie also. It is a very enjoyable action comedy that has tons of laughs and great special effects. This is one of the first movies that ive seen of Jim Carrey this was the movie that made me want to see more and more of him. This is definetly a very entertaining movie.
5,Wow! The Mask's got a Flexible body movement today!,"I really like this movie.I've seen it on TV like 5 times.Hey, that's a coincidence, I rated this movie 5 STARS!! Jim Carrey is one of my favorite actors.My favorite movie he acted in was ""Dumb And Dumber."" Anyway,in this movie, he had flexible body movements and he always said SMOKIN' in kind of a pretty good italianish voice.I wish I had a mask like this so I could do anything, and BE anything.He act's like a cartoon when he puts the mask on.But, the mask I hated was the one where Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) was the mask.He was pretty bad and cruel I should say.But the real mask Ipkiss is nice.He actually saved those people's lives.And I just want, to say that this is a great movie and I know you'll enjoy it."
4,AN UNEXPECTED THRILL OF LAUGHTER........,"FUNNY AND AMUSING. JIM CAREY IS THE ONLY ACTOR WHO COULD HAVE PULLED THIS ALL OFF.WHO WOULD SUSPECT THAT CAMERON DIAZ COULD SING AND DANCE? LIKE I SAID, THIS MOVIE WAS AN UNEXPECTED THRILL OF LAUGHTER........"
5,Great,"This is a classic movie. Laughed all the way through it. This movie never gets old. It is gre for the young and the old. Buy it today from kels1720 brand new, at a steal of a price, and treat yourself to a knee-slapping flick!"
3,Not so funny now.,"The Mask starring Jim Carrey was pretty funny and refreshing when it was released in 1994 but unfortanely this film fades with time. Carrey always gives a good performance but he's also kinda scary as the Mask. This movie is also the film debut of Cameron Diaz, she's va va voom in this one, she has great sex appeal. Good comedy but I'm pretty much over it."
3,The many faces of Jim Carrey,"I felt this was a great performance on the part of Jim Carrey, but the plot lacked for me. One shouldn't expect reality in a Carrey film, but it would have been nice to have seen this done a little more sensably. The plot is there, and boils down to make a point but I guess this really just isn't my cup of tea. This production was very well done with great visual effects, good acting, casting and a lot of comedy. The real hero of this film, is of course the dog who gives an academy award performance. I think he might have actually stolen the lead from Carrey on this one. Not a very thought provoking film, but funny and entertaining. I recommend it to anyone who loves outlandish, far-fetched comedy."
5,I love this movie!!,"Everyone has a movie that sort of takes them back to their childhood. The type of movie that makes you feel young again. The Mask is that movie for me. And to be completely honest--I really don't find it all that comical. Im not much of a Jim Carry fan and from a technical standpoint--the scripting is pretty bad. But somehow great imagery, fun characters, and funky big band music make it more enjoyable to watch. The movie's just got a good feel to it. I can still watch the entire thing with a smile on my face. I remember seeing Cameron Diaz for the first time and thinking she was the most beautiful woman on the planet. Haha! Its just a fun lighthearted movie and it puts me in a good mood every time I see it. Recommended."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable fun.,We remembered this movie from when our kids were home and decided to see it again. We enjoyed ourselves so much watching this crazy movie and Jim Carrey at his best. To add to our enjoyment...no previews! It was so wonderful to watch this movie with friends without fast forwarding through 20 previews. Amazon never lets us down.
1,Not what I ordered,"I know I should have written this awhile ago. However, the movie I received turned out to be FOUR movies, three of which I DIDN'T order in the first place. Also, the disc of the movie I wanted to see just so happened to be scratched! NOT COOL! Wicked Waste of money!"
3,Great Footage,"Much expense was spared in creating this, the second in a series on Magic's Grand illusions. However, priceless is the footage that's been collected and now preserved. If your a history buff, particularly a magic history buff, then you can't go wrong."
1,trite,I couldn't get through the first two chapters. The writing was terrible and the premise just didn't hold together. Give this one a pass
1,Waste of Paper,"The premise behind this book was great. There are so many things the author could have done with a gate that ""changes"" people when they go through. Instead we got a book that was obviously the authors attempt to ""legitimize"" a cheesy sex novel. Don't waste your money"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An interesting look at what would happen if the technology to just suddenly change sex appeared. With the added bonus of making you a young adult, again. Unsurprisingly, reasonable amounts of shagging involved, but at its core, it is sf, not sex with some science fiction elements. Not too bad an effort. It follows a group of friends and their survival through the societal upheaval that the introduction of this alien technology causes. Some of them develop super powers, of a sort, as well, and go looking to find out what goes on."
4,A very interesting and insightful read,"Michelet tracks the rise of what was termed ""witchcraft"" from its roots in the ancient pagan world up to the 18th century. He is unashamedly sympathetic to the women who were victimized by the witch-hunters (keep in mind it was written in 1862) and denounces the misogyny of the church. His descriptions, sometimes poetic and sometimes dripping with sarcasm, really enrich the book."
4,Totally purchase worthy!,"I purchased this CD years ago as a total Elvis hater turned appreciator after seeing the video and hearing the music. Elvis and Ann-Margret have an excellent chemistry and the Viva Las Vegas part of this CD is practically worn out! Buy this CD just for You're the Boss and The Lady Loves Me and you'll be happy. Buy the video, buy the CD and sing along! ...in the middle of the night when the moon is shining bright, you're the boss..."
5,I finally found this book from my childhood!,"My Aunt gave me this book when I was a child. I think I was in the second grade. I really liked the story and it felt very emotional for my age. I always made a connection with myself and Tomas. The book was wonderful to read and I believe it left a positive impact on my life.30 years later I am finally reunited with the book. Over the years I forgot the title of the book, but I never forgot the story. I tried to look for it, but I could not remember the name. I always remembered it had the name Thomas in it, but only with a different spelling. Funny thing happened recently, I came across someone named Tomas the other day. And POW! The name of the book came back to me!It is just as enjoyable to read today as it was 30 years ago. I will give this book to my 8 year old nephew as I hope it leaves a lasting impact with him as it did me. I highly recommend young people read this book. It is very thoughtful and appropriate for young people."
4,Organic Popcorn,Made some of this last night. Very delicious. It is nice to know it is organic and non-GMO which is rare these days.
5,"Pops great, few hulls, organic","We tried other organic popcorn, and this is the best we've found so far. It pops very well in our hot-air popper, with few unpopped kernels, and few hulls. Very tasty!The bags were shipped fairly quickly, considering they were coming from quite a distance, and when they were on backorder we were not charged for the shipping of the other bags.Very satisfied, will buy again. In fact, this is the second time we bought this, and will probably continue to buy."
2,nothing special,I purchased a new popper and at the same time purchased three bags of this popcorn. I am on the second bag now. I don't know why but this popcorn doesn't pop fully and I don't think it is the popper or me. I have varied the heat and oil levels so I think the popcorn may have a moisture or freshness issue or just something else. I store it after opening in a jar in a cool dark cabinet.I won't purchase this again even though it claims to be organic.
5,very good quality,"I've bought and used NOW products regularly and when I saw that they make their own popping corn, I clicked on the product right away. I just purchased the Lindsey Popper and upon initial use, made my first batch of popcorn to perfection. I used Grapeseed oil and can say that Now popping corn yielded a delicious and generous amount on my first try."
2,Stale,"I ordered this to use in a new hot air popper mostly because of the price. I've used it in the hot air popper plus used it to make caramel corn. The popcorn pops almost to the last kernel. The texture is quite nice and hulls are quite thin. However, the bag I received, even though the best by date is almost two years away, tastes stale."
4,"Sit back, grab a beer, and relax","This blissful set of songs remind me of hanging out with some good friends on a summer evening. Some of the tunes touched me immediately, while others took some time. But once I discovered the layout of the songs, I began to appreciate their texture, their personality. More specifically, ""Roam"" and ""Predicting the Weather"" happen to be some of my favorites. I could swear that Jerry speaks thru this band, and Dickman's fingerwork. Kudos to MR: May they carry on the music and spirit of their predecessors!"
5,An Awesome Resource for Cost Cutting...,"I worked in restaurants where I felt unappreciated. I pledged to not cut corners in making my staff feel valued in my own establishment. That seemed impossible once I looked at my bottom line. This book reminded me that cutting labor costs could lead to costlier recruiting expenses once my staff flees looking for other work. A simple improvement, such as outsourcing payroll to an online service, is convenient and saves money. I also learned that making my restaurant a safe and enjoyable environment is an act of employee retention. Encouraging my staff, or playing their favorite music in the kitchen, goes a long way in reducing turnover. Even the worst bosses start off with the best intentions. They eventually become so focused on the bottom line that they do not notice their staff's morale. This book shows you how to keep both in sight."
1,can we say Die Hard rip off,"holy shiznay in the pants, this one blows, though Kinski's in it she doesnt save it, but shes hot. its a great, great, great crappy Die Hard tip off as Plummer holds up a skitresort and Griffith(not even close to Willis) is the one man army to take them down. how painstakingly chunky and frunky"
4,It has all the right feelings!,All I can say is - it has all the right feelings in there. It is a true break from some of these listen-once-and-you'll-never-want-to-listen-again type of over-pushed music. A nice break on Channel V and MTV from Ricky-you-know-who!
3,Sadly Synchronized,"Compared to Traveling Without Moving and The Return of the Space Cowboy, this cd just doesn't get the job done. Many of the songs seem like they're overtly there just to fill space. Meritable songs such as Canned Heat, Black Capricorn Day and Butterfly are pretty good, but they just aren't enough to carry the whole album. Many of the songs are long and excessively drawn out. Again, the aforementioned songs are decent tracks, but the rest are subpar. Traveling Without Moving and The Return of the Space Cowboy are recommended instead of this one."
2,"WHY, WHY, WHY!!! Jay sold out!!! Missing Stuart already!","Travelling w/o Moving and Return of the Space Cowboy were inspirational, grooving CDs. This crap is DA WORST. I really looked forward to this, but it's missing something (Stuart?) The lyrics are boorish and the music is industrial pap. If you don't own any Jamiroquai, get the last two and skip this one. It's a shay-ya-yame, when an group falls like this. Sniff...."
1,Gettin' down down...,"This is not Jamiroquai (Jam-session + Iroquoi) anymore. I'm so disappointed with this new album. Jay Kay has completely lost his soul & spirituality into his music. As a big fan of Jamiroquai, I really didn't wanna see this change. Jamiroquai wasn't a ""pop"" band before..."
1,very ughh!,i like the first two alright and parts of the third one but this sounds tired and predictable.it sounds rushed and uninspired.i love good 70's sounding music when i hear it.the stevie wonder meets roy ayers thing was cool but it's become stamped and that's not original.thus far they have put out better singles than discs for me.
2,never give up a good bassist....,"In this age of samples and other less musical forms, it's refreshing to see a band like JAMIROQUAI enjoy this much sucess. However, the grooves present on the first three CD's just don't happen here. Why? The Baddest bassist since MOTOWN has left the group..leaving a hole that can't be filled in by synths. I would think that they're looking for a replacement and if not, then hmmm. As a working bassist, the first thing I check for is the Bottom....Then we get to the 'funk' of the music..."
2,DEEPLY INFERIOR TO THEIR PAST STUFF,"The source of Funk is the Bass guitar. The loss of their old bassist really hurts them on this album. In past albums, especially the second, the bass was MELODIOUS. Here it is deeply reptitive. Every other bar is repeated! NO MELODY. This hurts when you have no lead guitar! The vocals aren't sufficient to carry the whole melody of the tune. So you get basically some nice textures that you can dance to but nothing to soothe the musical ear. Just listen to the bass play 4 quarter notes down the scale EVERY OTHER BAR in the Planet Home. I think i learned to do that my first day on recorder. All the other tunes are the same, they just grab a lick and repeat it. Then listen to the bass on manifest destiny from the second album. What a contrast! Their current bassist doesnt walk any further than one bar (on Falling). Just listen to the bass, see if you agree."
2,Synk isn't what we all expected...,"Well after having this CD a few weeks now, I figured it would've grown on me by now but it hasn't. Sure it's got a few decent songs, but nothing that will be memorable for the band. On the other side, what can you expect after shelving the orignal Synkronized album and having to come up with all new tracks. I do give Jay and the boys some credit for that! Well hey, this does mean another tour and we can only hope for better next time..."
4,The Bomb!,"I didn't get hip to Jamiroquai until the Travelling Without Moving CD, but have had opportunity to hear the old as well as the new stuff. This album is hot! It's so often the case that we hear one song from a new album play on the radio and run out to buy the CD, only to find that the one song was all there was worth listening to. Synkronized IS NOT ONE OF THOSE ALBUMS! Every cut on here is funky, but I especially like Canned Heat, Butterfly, King for A Day and the too-hype Supersonic. I will definitely be playing Synkronized at my next party. Support a real band for a change and buy this CD...you won't regret it."
3,average,not as good...as the previous Jamiroquai albums... decent effort...I expect a little more...next time around
1,zzzzzzzz.....zzzzzzzzz...Boring!,"Sorry to say this, but people who buy this album must be crazy. We're on the 90's not the 70's! Avoid this one like the plague."
1,J Lost the Funk,"Rehash disco with nuttin' new limp lyrics. The whole recording is like a compilation of the not-so-groovy boring tunes from the previous records. And yet, I see Jamiroquai posters and splashy marketing everywhere. Ahhh, the power of a money marketing machine. Skip this record and pray that Jay will pull it together on the next."
2,What happened J?,"This is the point where I simply said ciao to being a Jamiroquai fan, because this album is really poor. I was hesitating on giving it 1 star, but that would be unfair because it does achieve some sort of music flavour, but following on from Travelling, Jamiroquai had totally lost their creativity with this one. Strings have totally taken over where horns and synths used to rule, and make this album depressingly flat. Rather than being in any way cutting edge, the obvious characteristic from the 1st 3 albums, it turns into a really bad version of Earth, Wind & Fire. It simply doesn't compare to earlier work, even Travelling, but especially Emergency and Space Cowboy. Maybe it was Denise, or maybe it was that JK became closer to his cars than his supposed environmentalism, but whatever the guy lost it with this one."
1,Sadly they are only money motivated,"The band who once wanted to save the world, became a money machine. It started at ""travelling.."" and got to this. Boring album which repeats itself. All tracks writen by Jay, who seemed to give it all in their first and second album. none written by brilliant keyboard player, Toby. No smart base lines, nothing thrilling. No jazz only money-making-greedy-boring dance music. It's a shame for such a brilliant band to become a one man band."
2,very disappointing,"Being a die-hard fan of jamiroquai is hard to say it but I miss the spark that shone through Emergency ( mind blowing) and Return (their masterpiece). Kicking Stuart Zender ( the bassist) out of the band has taken the 90% of the magic. Jamiroquai is about sounding predictable, it is a formula we enjoy because it reminds us of the good old funk, but this one is sinking. Get Stuart again, Jay!"
2,Disapointment!,"Major disapointment! Jamiroquai has unfortunately crossed over from jazzy/funk to cheesey disco. The string section sounded good on Traveling Without Moving but Synkronized is chock full of cheesey disco strings and uninspired bass lines. The new bass player does not even compare. The one thing they did right this time was cut the album time down instead of overindulging like they did on their previous albums. If you like the single Canned Heat then you will probably like the rest of this album. Personally, I think Canned Heat is an overproduced piece of disco-cheese. Forget this album and buy Travelling Without Moving for the funkier stuff. If you like it less dancy and more jazzy go back to their first two albums. Otherwise, go get yourself some Funkadelic."
5,The Same Sound Sounds Even Better,"Jamiroquai returns with the same distinctive sound wrapped in a tighter package. The disc shows more range from the band with a greater commercial sensibility, and the results are outstanding. From top to bottom, every song is great. THIS IS A FANTASTIC ALBUM. It will inevitably be remembered for decades to come. The record company is pushing ""Canned Heat"" and ""Black Capricorn Day"" as the top songs, but I think ""Supersonic"" with its powerful dance rhythm and ""King For a Day"" with its haunting melody are better. In any event, everyone will find plenty of favorites in this album of ten top quality, wide ranging and ultimately awesome songs."
2,regrettable!,"I'ts a great pity that Jamiroquai have changed their style like this. This album is not to compare with ""space cowboy"" or ""emergency..."""
2,Hit or Miss,I only liked one song. J is a hit or miss kind of artist. His style is nice but the songs don'y pull me like i thought they would. i bought it for the one song.
3,Certainly good if not great,"3 1/2I was kind of disappointed when i first heard this back in the day. Coming off of their quintessential pleaser TWM, Synkronized seemed to continue pushing towards radio-friendly funk and soul at the expense of better songwriting, making the impressive interplay and arrangements found on their first few releases even less prominent. But time has been kind to this release, and a fair amount of tracks attest to Kay's street-pop sensibilities, displaying an elegant simplicity in the always-reliable production which does prove less is sometimes more."
5,The New Jamiroquai's MasterPiece,"Thanks to the underground MP3 scene, I get a chance to have an hear to the promotional release ripped by RNS. There have been a lot of work among this stuff and there would be no deception. Jamiroquai has improved it's skilled and delivers a nice mix of jazz hip-hop and house culture. Every Music addict would be surprised by the magic beat of the Jayson Kay Orchestra. I'm now waiting for the release of singles and remix and the Jamiroquai Incoming in France..."
5,Synkronized almost Jamiroquai's best album!,"Jamirouqai fans around the world should rejoice when the hear the funky vibes from their latest cd - ""Synkronized"". Led by Disco style canned heat through the romantic soul Butterfly to my favourite ""where do we go from here"" upbeat tunes, Jamiroquai have almost excelled themselves although ""travelling without moving"" (their last album) was a truely amazing cd!~"
4,"If you don't tap your feet to this, you've got some issues.","I'm really glad that I listened to this CD at Borders, because it is a treat for the ears. The sound that this band possesses is so unique, and stands out in a crowd of bad modern music. Jay Kay's voice is great for the style of music, and the band itself has got some real talent. Although some of the tunes do go on a bit too long, ""Black Capricorn Days"" more than makes up for them. I think I want to buy more of them!"
4,Synchronized keeps with Jay Kay's original sound,This is a great album that keeps it real with Jamiroquai's older albums but is not afraid to try new things as well. Track 10 is probably my favorite.
3,Pretty Good Modern Disco and Funk,Not many groups are still putting out funk and disco style music but here is an exception and it's pretty good at that. With a variety of different beat styles and musical modes this CD contains a lot of variety yet it all seems to stem from a single theme. The best new funk/disco I've heard in a long time.
2,generic retro disco music,"It's really a shame that the funky originality of Jamiroquai's first two records has gotten more than stale on the third and latest effort. The first track, Canned Heat, is certainly danceable (the MTV crowd will love it, no doubt) but one might as well go out and buy some old Donna Summer or Bee Gees if in the mood for generic disco. Jay Kay's songwriting should have gotten more creative over time, not less so, as appears to be the case."
4,"New album rocks, but where are the long jams?","I am a huge fan of Jamiroquai and am impressed with the album. Destitute Illusion is my favorite track on the album, its a stony soul jam that grooves. My only dissapointment is that the tracks seem much shorter than the ones on previous albums. Long jams like ""just another story"" are absent and very missed; much like Stewart. Don't get me wrong, this is a great album that no true Jamiroquai fan should be without and I can't wait to see them at the greek(LA)in July. Hopefully it won't be as long a wait for the next album to come out, perhaps we'll get Stewart back (one can always hope)."
4,Next best thing to attending one.,I was very surprised at how beautiful this movie is and how well the matadors career is shown. I think it is a fascinating career choice in such a demanding tradition.
5,Excellent bullfighting video!,I am a Spanish teacher and have been looking for a replacement video for a bullfighting unit that we do in class. This video is absolutely fantastic! It gives an excellent view into the art and shows many great quality video clips of the bullfight and behind the scenes involving what really happens at a bullfight. The video is in Spanish with subtitles and really gives the kids a workout listening and the musical score is outstanding. THIS IS GREAT FOR A SPANISH CLASS!
5,Amazing documentary,"A must see for all bullfighting aficionados. Captures perfectly the culture of the sport and gives you great insights into the world of El Fandi. Incredible footage, brilliant colors, and an amazing story which will keep you at the edge of your seat."
4,Interesting topic. Excellent on Blu-Ray,"A friend of mine had given me this movie as a gift on Blu-Ray and I must say this format really lends itself to the color and pageantry of the Bull fighting world.The topic is a little controversial, and this movie is not for the squeamish, as it is very graphic in the killing of the Bulls.Considering that, this is an interesting journey of one young rising star who tries to achieve 100 wins in a single season.Mostly in Spanish with English subtitles, this is an interesting topic that lends itself to the format very nicely."
5,Excellent and Educational!,"I bought this DVD to show clips of it to my students in Spanish class. I know bullfighting is not very popular outside the Spanish-speaking culture, but this documentary shows the artistic aspect of it. My students were very impressed with the amount of work and training that goes into this. They were begging for more! Definitely worth the money. :-)"
4,A good documentary,"Since I was going to show this to my sixth graders, I was concerned when I received it and one of the descriptive words on the front of the DVD was 'Erotic!' Turns out, they must have been using 'erotic' in a symbolic sort of way. A documentary about the life of the bullfighter, David Fandila; the movie is very tastefully done and was a perfect complement to the novel study we'd completed on the book ""Shadow of a Bull."" Living in Spain, we are surrounded by bullfighting; now we understand it a little more."
5,One of the best doc's I have seen and I have seen a lot.,I seen a lot of bullfights in my life and this Documentary captures what a bullfight is all about.
5,Great movie,"Here is a chance for anglos to see the greatness of the art of bullfighting. Most people can't see past the gore and they center themselves on the death of the bull. Get to know the men who do it rather than just condemning the activity. Learn first, then judge. This movie allows you to do that. And if you still want to condemn bullfighting, then stop eating meat as well, because that steak did not grow on a tree!!! :)"
5,The Matador - David Fandilla,"What a wonderful matador the directors chose as the subject of their documentary. An original and skilled torero, David is humble and ""campechano"", very approachable. The photography and the colors of this film are spectacular and give a brilliant picture of what the bullfight is all about. This is no mean feat, as bullfighting is an event that does not usually come across well on film - it is something that has to be experienced live. I am also impressed with the presence of the ""anti-taurinos"", the growing number of anti-bullfighting protesters. Like El Fandi says in his understated manner, it is no different to kill a bull who has been bred for bullfighting than it is to kill a turkey who has been bred to be a Thanksgiving meal. I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in Spain and/or bullfighting."
5,I'm a Pro and I love it!,"We all know that fixed lenses are the best but sometimes a zoom lens can be very useful, actually this is the only zoom I own and I absolutely love it. I could do any job with it: weddings, portrait, ring shots, etc. Highly recommended. If you are an amateur DON'T BUY THE KIT LENS, just the body (whatever brand you like) and this lens."
1,Waste of money,"I threw this dvd out after one watch, Berkeley should be embarrassed. A five minute lesson basically with some very basic theory. Here is the entire dvd: Listen for the bass note in the chord and try to figure it out from there."
2,like watching a train wreck,"Wow. This has to be the worst book I've ever read. I kept thinking that, and I couldn't put it down, it was so bad, but in a compelling way, kind of like a train wreck. The characters were totally flat and unrealistic (never mind Diana Mayo's sudden, total transformation from insufferable boy-girl to snivelling ""woman""), with the possible exception of Raoul. The writing was not great, and lacked vivid imagery and dialog (but somehow it kept going, I'm still not sure how). And the racism! The totally unabashed orientalism! That in itself was fascinating. Such a book could not be written today (thank god... oh, hell, maybe it almost could, now), and so it was interesting for the historical perspective. I was a little surprised to see that it had been re-issued - I found a 1921 edition here at my parent's house and looked online just to see what I could find.So bad it's good."
3,The Sheik,"This is hard to rate. It's a chick book, for sure; but not all chicks will like it. I'd always wanted to read it, even more so after I'd spent several years in the Middle East. The author got the atmosphere and sense of place very well. Even the characters have more depth than one might expect. All things considered, there are only two real problems: the author tried to build suspense but only got repetitive, and the plot device used to resolve the characters' dilemma was disappointing. This is very much a book of its time, despite its more risque features. That said, it's almost a 'must read' due to the frequency with which it is referenced in modern contexts."
3,The Grandfather of Desert Romance Novels,"I have this rule that I follow when it comes to movie adaptations: if it's based on a book, read the book first. (Of course, there are times when I HAVE broken that rule... but that's irrelevant.) Such was the case with ""The Sheik."" I wanted to see the 1921 silent film, but I read the book on Project Gutenburg first.For something that was considered scandalous when it was first published, it's actually a little ridiculous. There are some rather feminist quibbles that I have with Diana's behavior (which I'm positive other reviewers have addressed), so I won't go into that. As a writer, I WAS impressed with the way Hull describes the setting and events and the transitions from Diana's POV to Ahmed's and so forth. Even with all of its shortcomings and little triumphs, I can't deny that it makes a good read when trying to pass the time because it IS engrossing, if nothing else."
4,Read and make your own conclussions,"This book is quite good, in a way it is possible, psychologically speaking, since Diana's personality was vulnerable to fall in love with someone like Ahmed Ben Hassan. Diana Mayo had a lack of love all her life, and suddenly she falls in love with her kidnapper. This happens quite frequently and it's called the sindrom of Estocolm. There are somethings that I didn't like of this novel. First, the way in which Diana Mayo realizes, so suddenly, that she is in love and the severe change in her; and also to consequent that kind of relationships, which only mentally illed people would have. Any way the book is very romantic and it is one of my favorites, even though is a little bit corny."
1,bleh,"I don't know what's more horrifying: this book, or the reviews talking about how ""romantic"" it is to read about a woman who's kidnapped and raped until she falls in love with her rapist."
2,A bit unbelievable,"To be honest, I had difficulty getting through this one. The characterization of Diana changes drastically, too drastically. She begins as a strong, adventurous character and then turns into a grovelling, wimpering, whining creature as soon as she is abducted. I don't believe that such a drastic change can realistically happen in one night. However, this is an interesting look at the female reading material of the period and gives some interesting insight into attitudes toward women and attitudes of women of themselves (if I remember correctly, the author is female)."
4,The Sheik,"The Sheik is a very romantic book. The sex in it is hinted at, rather than explicit. The basic story is of a kidnapped girl, who falls in love with her kidnapper. Even as I was enjoying the story, my mind was rebelling against her falling for him. The book was written quite a few years ago & I found the hints of sex much more exciting than the in-your-face sex of modern books."
2,If You Like Luke and Laura,"This is the ultimate male fantasy romance novel. I literally threw it across the room when I finished it and annotated it with phrases such as ""AAAHHH"" and ""I think I'm going to puke"" and ""you've got to be kidding me"". If you are looking for a chuckle and beach read and you have little expectations beyond a ridiculous romance with odd undertones and a twisted ending that only a true romantic pre-1950 could enjoy, this is the book for you."
4,;0),Not bad for a romance novel written and release in 1919. Kept my interest and even if the Sheik was a bit harsh at time Diana was still a very strong woman. I really enjoyed this book some people may not like how Diana was treated but it is a book of fiction I have seen worst on TV and in other Books.
4,Very interesting,I liked this book very much. I thought the story line was original and thought provoking. I heard about this author while reading another book.
2,So very intrigued.,"So I haven't read the book...yet. I'm browsing through Amazon after checking out my book list for next fall, when I'll be taking Popular Fiction: The Romance Novel, a class entirely dedicated to books like this (incidentally, this one's on the list). I must say, I think romance novels are completely ridiculous (I've read a few and every single one of them contain the same elements regarding the sphere of male-female relations) although I was looking forward to detailed discussions on their absurdity and making fun of the writing for hours on end. I'm very glad to have read all your reviews and I am very much anticipating the literature trainwreck to come!"
2,Pretty but not entirely useful,"This cheery little pamphlet, which starts out soundinglike ""Mushrooms are our friends,"" gets a bit darker withevery page. The last has a ""Cut this out and keep it bythe phone"" label with the numbers for the poison controlcenters. Inside, there are lovely color illustrations (withno indication of whether or not the item is edible),followed by increasingly alarming instructions about notcarrying mushrooms in plastic (makes them sweat andincubate yeast, mold and bacteria); not feeding them tothe old, sick or young; and saving a few out of eachbatch for emergency analysis in case you've guessedwrong."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I bought this Kona brand of beans based on reviews and think the responses are somewhat exaggerated. I would imagine that some of these reviews are employees or friends of Aloha Island Coffee? After shipping I paid $27.45 for a bag of beans that are okay, but nowhere near phenomenal as the review rave. Milestone brand found in most supermarkets retails $10 a pound and easily rivals the flavor of this brand. I will accept the fact that my disapproval may be due to my specific low acidic taste requirements. I do not like strong coffee with a bitter overtone, albeit this medium roast is on the strong side.In favor of Aloha Island Coffee, they did not hesitate to refund my money, keeping true to their claim of 100% satisfaction guaranteed."
5,Coffee,"This purchase was received as described, good quality, well packaged, very timely, and I would purchase from this seller again!"
2,Not for the casual reader,The subtitle is a very good indication of the flavor of the book. It includes the Latin name of the species Felis silvestris catus. What follows is more of a highly scientific analysis of cats than a guide to understanding your pet. The generally pratical information is scant and overwhelmed by massive digressions in evolutionary and historical explainations. I got to page 100 and couldn't bear to read any more.
3,not in excellent condition,"even though this book was said to be in great condition, the cover had a huge crease through it. Good/fair, but shouldn't have been more than that!"
4,a reader,"I find it interesting that so many of the readers that review this book poorly do so because the book doesn't reinforce their pre-conceived notions of cat behaviour (this is also true of Budiansky's book about dogs - the number of readers that trashed his book because he doesn't believe that dogs ""unconditionally love"" their owners was truly sad). These reviews often say more about human behaviour than they do about cat behaviour.If you are interested in cats, and are not afraid to have your beliefs challanged, this book is a truly fascinating read. Otherwise, you're probably better off staying away."
2,Not detailed enough for medical students/physicians,"This is a clearly written easily understood book, with excellent diagrams. As a medical practitioner I was looking for a detailed, authoritative surface anatomy text. While well written, this text is too superficial for anything other than an introduction to surface anatomy."
2,Jully Black This is me,I was very disappointed. There was only one good song on this CD so I feel very cheated
3,The CD was ok,"I had never heard of Jully black prior to today. I listened to her CD and thought it was ok, it isn't worth buying, yet it won't hurt to check it out."
2,Not as spectacular as made to sound,"This book is a good caustic review of the methodology of world affairs. The book is a very simple and repetitive read. Though the ideas are absolutely brilliant analyses and very effective, all the major ideas of the book could have been shortened to within a page and still been just as effective. This is one of those books that talks about three central points (given away by the title) and states a thousand examples for each point. Just ask a friend what this one's about...dont bother reading it unless you have a professor that will test you on how many hairs napoleon had on his toes. Enjoy!"
5,Need to listen,I sent this CD to my daughter for car music when driving her baby around and she said it was a excellent CD both her and her baby as well as passangers love it very unique mix Enjoy.
3,Good music,Good music but now words. I didn't realize the would just be the music when I ordered it. Was in a rush to get it and didn't take the time to read. Oops.
5,Love It,The Bob Marley Lullaby Renditions cd is my favorite.....also have The Beatles and Metallica. These cd's make lullaby music bearable. I highly recommend these cd's. The music is beautiful. I think we'll get The Eagles next.
5,"""FINALLY""","I am a HUGE Bob Marley fan and""I love this""Finally something both mother and child can listen to and enjoy together.Beware not all of the ""ROCKABYE BABY!"" cd's are that good.I recommend the Beatles and No Doubt."
2,Marley on a xylophone - elevator music,"I got this CD as a gift and was very excited. I am a big Bob fan and was anxious to pass it on to my newborn. This CD is what I assume will be played in the third ring of hell in my Dantes inferno. It is literally a muzak version of Bob Marleys most mainstream songs played on a xylophone. If that sounds pleasant to you, this CD is for you. I was looking for something with singing. I also have a CD called 'B is for Bob' and it is much better. The music has Bob singing over it and they include a children's chorus backing him up."
2,OK- but there is better MyCradleTunes,"Rockabye is great but I don't love all the songs on the album. Go to [...]. You can custom build CDs and there are more options- country, rock, pop- everything for baby!!!!!!! You can even request songs you would like added to the site. Awesome!"
5,"""The Best Of The Best!""","This album is terribly infectious! Can't stop listening to it. If you claim to be a salsa fan then this compilation of music is a must have. Let's just say it's like having the BEST of the BEST. One of the very best albums I've ever bought, ever!"
1,Still Broken,My second attempt at ordering this candle - it too came completely smashed! Very disappointing as this is a rare scent and difficult to find. Returned this one too! Packaging could certainly use some improvement.
5,My favorite of all Yankee candles,"I have a strong nostalgic attachment to this candle so my review is slightly biased, but this candle doesn't disappoint! I bought it because it reminded me of my younger days when my cousin used to burn this specific fragrance. I was disappointed to hear that it had been ""retired"" from the Yankee Candle lineup not only because it was my favorite fragrance but also because I felt that blueberry should be a standard candle. It's not like it's some kind of holiday special or unique fragrance that only certain people would want. However, I'm sure sales numbers played a role in that and I must be one of the few that loved this candle.Anyway, if you can still get it, do so because it does so much more justice than the so-called replacement they currently sell, Blueberry Scone. On a related note, I did just notice that they now sell one called Blueberry Muffin, but I have yet to try it. Sounds good though!"
4,short wick on Blueberry Candle,"I think this candle smells very nice, but it looks like it has been burned before, the wick is very short, which is not normal if it is a new candle, I lke the fragrance.I order from Yankee Candle regularly, and have tons of candles, the wicks are not this short-Perhaps someone lit it just to smell it."
4,Want mindless button mashing...? YES PLEASE.,"These types of beat-em up games get alot of flack and criticism because they lack depth and innovation, but sometimes the same old goodness is what's needed. I'm a huge fan of dynasty warriors and I think this game is just another solid addition to that type of play. There's some new variations, but overall its same thing, which isn't always a bad thing. People seem to think that games should just get more and more complicated, thus making them better, but that's not always the case. There's got to be a market for people who just want to mindlessly beat dudes up and not think about much else.This game is great and I'm totally glad they keep making them. Despite the negative critiques from major internet game sites, there is alot to discover and enjoy in a game like this. You definitely get what you pay for and that doesn't happen much. enjoy."
4,Son loves it!,Bought it for my son and he loves it. Came very quickly and in great shape. My son is 14 and thinks the game is great! Amazon is a great place to find new older games!
4,Barrett-Jackson - Great cars across the block,"Barrett-Jackson, maybe more than any other auctioneer or even Car Guy, has done a whole lot to promote the market for classic cars.This book is a nice collection of cars that have gone across the Barrett-Jackson Block, if yet another attempt to promote the Classic Car market.There are plenty high quality pictures of muscle cars, as to be expected of Barrett-Jackson, as well as a sampling of earlier cars from the 40's and 50's. Even Woodies, like the one featured inRock of Morro Bayare represented.This is a really enjoyable book for car lovers and for those of us who sit glued to our TV a couple times a year as Barrett-Jackson televises its newest auction of the season live for all to see."
2,Is a thriller that isn't fun still categorized a thriller?,"This Japanese independent film, I believe, is the only independent film of the summer that I truly disliked. The movie revolves around a serial killer with the power to control minds to do his killing. I might have liked it if it weren't so long and repetitive, (one killing after another with almost no further plot development- not a good thing when dealing with repetition), and maybe had some three dimensional characters. Unfortunately, the gratuitous violence, which I can rarely, but this time, honestly say, is gratuitous, doesn't make up for the movie's lack of energy, rhythm, or characters, not to mention the far-fetched plot that would have required an ounce of creativity to pull off."
1,Horrible,"I got this movie because of all the good reviews it received, and it's suppose to be an Asian horror film, or so it's categorized under. After watching it I was thoroughly disappointed. The movie didn't make much sense at all. There were random dead monkeys around, and the ending was even more confusing. I've seen my share of weird Asian horror films, but this was just lame. There was no resolve or much less a real plot to think over."
4,Gentle and Enigmatic Glimpses,"These nine stories feature various gentle, usually innocent main characters who are faced with dilemmas or knowledge that even they do not often understand. The stories are well-written. They are touchingly understated. Their gentleness amplifies the almost-hidden pain of the characteres. Somehow, the veneer of innocence in the stories makes the hints of ugliness even more shocking. These stories are enigmatic glimpses into the real world."
4,Fantasic!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of his best since ""Voices Of The Heart"". I urge you to buy this CD. It's one of his best. I don't throw praise around alot on some of his stuff. That means this is a Winner.When you see this in a store grab it & buy it."
5,elvis cd,"just what we wanted. my daughter wanted ""happy ending"" as the song she & her groom walked out on at her wedding... it was perfect!"
1,"I agree with E. Mcnair ""lamcnair""","I agree with the review by E. Mcnair ""lamcnair"" . This book is just rubbish. I recieved this book with another by this author. A joke. I can't believe she has a PHD. It's scarey when today people who spew out this junk are able to hold a degree. Sorry but true. This book is junk as well along with everything else she has written. She is popular with the mainstream because everything she writes is so easy to follow and no meditation or effort is required. Having studied the occult for awhile now over the years it's not this simple...Angels are not a genie waiting to grant your wish. If that were true...why aren't they off healing child and people with cancer,...or saving children and adults from horrible fates EVERYDAY not just a story here and there on the repulsive Oprah show."
5,Great Book!,"I highly recommend this book to anyone that needs a little encouragement.This book helped me get through a rough spot in my life, and helped my realize that we are all truly blessed."
5,What an amazing book!!!,I'm just starting my spiritual journey and am so grateful to the person who recommended this book. It is amazing!
5,Healing with the Angels,"This is a wonderful, easy to understand book on how to communicate with angels. I am trying to get it on everyone's bookshelf - it is top on my gift list!"
5,absolutely beautiful,"this is one of the most beautiful ,loving books i have read in my life..i read this book at a time when my life was really rough..my health had gone bad and i was feeling hopeless..then healing with the angels arrived .i had ordered it and forgotten about it..it arrived at my door the day i came back from the doctor feeling extreamly sick..the moment i opened the book i felt the love and protection of the angels in my life,and felt that life would look up..each page is filled with love and light and beautiful healing affirmations..i totally love this book ...i think doreen virtue is a true lightworker and i seriously feel this is the first book a person attempting to find out about angels should read..absolutely beautiful"
5,Achangels can heal and remove negativity,"Achangels can heal and remove negativityI am just amazed in how many books are written about Archangel Michael, Archangel and Angels.I have been working and experiencing wonderful healing with the loving angels. This book is defiantly a keeper in my shelf. It brings you the awareness to the love and care of the angels.Healing with these amazing and loving beings of God can bring you so much joy, harmony and peace in your life.I facilitate angel workshops and love teaching and sharing to my students the wonderful works of Doreen Virtue.I am also using the guided meditation CD called ""Clearing With Archangel Michael"" with magical harp music by Peter Sterling. There are other wonderful healing angelic meditation CDs available in this web site"
4,Doreen Virtue,I am not much for writing reviews let alone writing more then a few words and don't like it when forced to so I liked it. It comes in handy.
3,Healing With The Angels,"I ordered several books regarding angels. If I remember correctly, I was not particularly impressed with them. Maybe I was expecting too much"
3,Good for the money,"Just got one from Computer Geeks. Delivery was fast, but the packaging was trashed. Looked like it took a trip around the world a few times, and handled by gorillas before ariving. Openned it up and it looked like I wasn't the first to be in there. But everything worked. I suspect it is refurbished, even though it's advertised to be new.Set it up and it looks nice. The casing design is sharp looking. The quality is decent. My only gripes are it displays a big, blue Dell logo for a few seconds each time you turn it on. (hopefully a way to turn that off). The other bad thing is the blacks are not too black. A common problem with cheaper LCDs. I guess they call that contrast ratio. It's not so good on this TV."
1,Don't underestimate the grip problem - pick a different product!,"I own a small version of the Bio Ionic blue wave (square) brushes and I think it's a great brush - it's easy to handle and it glides through my hair. I thought I'd give the XL round brush a try and I regret doing so. I had read the review in which the reviewer presented the challenges associated with the slippery grip and I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal. Wow, was I wrong. Not only is the grip slippery but the diameter of the handle is very small making it very difficult to hold on to the brush without exerting a lot of force with my hand. It is literally painful to dry my shoulder length, relatively thin hair. And my hair ends up full of static.I have never written a review on a product before - I have never felt compelled to - but this was such a poorly designed product that is now not returnable, and I felt it important to let others know what they're getting into before they make the purchase."
4,last review,"about the last review i will buy this item now and i will tell you what i thinkabout it later what i think is YUKKY is that when your sun pee in that seat u don't clean it, it collect gearms so you should clean it every time he use it, just to be cleani do that to my 1 and a half years old daughter use her potty training seat"
4,I would have waited a few years for this to come to market...,"I would have saved myself a ton of money on Crappy Dj Equipment. The BCD 3000 sounds good, Midi performs like a dream. Now I can sit down and mix. I have Deckadance from FL studio and they work together flawlessly.This is not a pro piece by most standards. But for home and hobby it as well as the occasional house party this rocks!"
2,"Nothing special, nasty problems","Although I have had better luck with other Behringer audio products this one was a let down for me. Neither of the dials on the unit I received spun smoothly. In fact they both jammed so hard at certain points in their rotation that it was hard to even move them without significant force, making the product completely useless. You won't find the nice endless rotary controllers or motorized faders from some of Behringer's other controllers here either, and there really is nothing outstanding about this unit I can mention other than its layout is a nice match for NI Traktor DJ.For the record, I'm returning mine for a refund. I would have simply exchanged it if it had any redeeming qualities, but Behringer will have to work harder on this one I'm afraid."
2,Don't buy Behringer if you want long term support,"Not a bad controller for the price - a lot of capabilities. Slightly lightweight and cheap feel, but then it is cheap. However, forget it if you want to use it beyond Windows XP 32 bit. Behringer say they provide a Win 7 64 bit driver, but it is only an audio driver, no controls! Why would you provide this for a Deck controller? It shows very poor attitude to customer support not to provide support on the next generation of PCs."
4,A good choise for this money,"It's not the best controller on the world but it's hard to get something better for this money. Ideal for all beginners and home users. Made for Tractor.Setup note: included drivers don't work. Works perfectly with newest drivers downloaded from the internet. (tested with Windows 7 & Tractor)Package includes: controller, power cord, USB cable, CD with drivers & Tractor LE.International warning: included power cord has an US style plug. However, controller itself supports 100-240 V AC. So, to use it outside US, just replace included cable with an appropriate one or use an adapter."
4,Good for begginer djs,This I a great mixer I bought it as a backup and it provides wonderfully. I would recomend it if your low on money or just want to mess around. But if your a professional it's worth spending he extra money.
1,Dont buy,Worst customer service. they will bring out a new version instead of fixing problems with existing one. beware. I have had problems over the years. I thought a German company could be trusted.
1,behringer b-control mixer BCD3000,Seemed like a good mixer for starting out with but the software was not compatible with VISTA and there are no upgrades on Behringer's website for the software. Had to send back to shipper for refund.
1,Dont waste your money,"Not only is this unit extremely cheap and fragile. The included software was horrible and the hard to use...also wouldn't work correctly with virtual DJ. If i were you i would save my money a little while longer and buy a good reliable product that is a little more expensive, this deal really was too good to be true."
2,poor shipping speed.,"I paid to have product delivered in 2 days, but amazon and DHL freaked that up! wonder how iam suppose to get reimbursed for their mistake. hopefully product will be worth it whenever it gets here!!!!! amazon need to tighten up on shipping shi_. I believe that its a wrap wih internet ordering."
3,BCD3000,"The BCD3000 is a good product if you are just starting out DJing. You don't have to burn any CDs. I purchased this because I was going to be overseas for 3 months and didn't want to go too long without DJing. It works well but the downside is that if you want to record your sets you have to spend an extra $120 to upgrade your software. As long as you have a use for Traktor then it's not bad to spend that money but other than that it's a waste.The downside is it felt kind of cheap. The knobs didn't seem like they worked too great, but it will get you by. If it's your first set of DJing equipment then you wouldn't notice though."
2,What a disappointment,"After my experience with the Behringer BCD2000, I figured us Mac users would have a chance to rejoice as Behringer introduced the new model which tailored especially for Mac users. Well, as you may have been psyched and done all of your research, you've probably found out how a Behringer BCD2000 or BCD3000 is supposed to perform using Traktor DJ Studio. If you've seen it in action on a PC, you'll find that it's not the same for Mac. You CAN'T configure the USB inputs for Traktor, so if you need to tweak some controls, you aren't able to. Scratching was a big letdown too. You can't scratch without bringing the track to a stop either - you're better off spinning back the record with your mouse for a more authentic vinyl sound. Also, you can't do an instant play from the cue point... you need to cue pause first and then play it again. I'm considering other USB controller options at this point, because this simply doesn't cut it."
4,Behringer BCD-3000,AMAZON THE BEST ONLINE RETAILER AND BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER.Unfortunately I receive 2order defecitve and that's not Amazon fault they were able to help me out with a replacement and send me a third one. I'll give it one more try to Behringer and if come's out defective I'll would change brand at least for Behringer DJ Mixer.Thanks AMAZON...
5,EXCELLANT,A MOTHER OF AN AUTISIC CHILD DECIDES TO PUT HIM IN A HOME FOR HELP. AFTER SHE IS TOLD NOT TO VISIT FOR 2 WEEKS. SHE WANTS TO TAKE HIM OUT.BUT SHE DIDN'T AND DOESN'T REGRET IT
3,TV spin-off book,"It is hard to find the ""original"" Magic School Bus books as opposed to the ones based on the TV series. If you look at the copyright page, it does say from a TV episode BASED on the Magic School Bus books written by Joanna Cole. I would like this information put in the product details section.I find that the books based on the TV series have a small fraction of the science of the ""original"" MSB books. I would only give this book to children in pre-school or kindergarten."
1,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I am a big fan of the Magic School Bus Series and also impressed with the chapter books and easy reader type books they have, which is great for varying reading levels within a classroom. Having said that, I was very disappointed with ...Makes a Rainbow. It is indeed confusing and unclear for younger readers as some of the other reviewers stated. My first grade students were not too impressed with this book to say the least. Making reference to and using the idea of a pinball machine distracted from the factual information it attempted to teach about rainbows."
2,A little confusing for a 5 year old,My nephew likes this book but it's a little confusing for a five year old.The book is about how light refracts through a prism to produce all thecolors of the rainbow.The level of this book is at about a 10 year old level.Not for children.
1,Skip this one,"I love the magic school bus series and find most of them superb. This one, however, is tedious, repetitive and confusing. Not worth a look."
3,Shuttle away!,"The Shuttle works great and it's very intuitive to work with. I use it especially in After Effects to go frame by frame. I'm a little bummed however with the fast forward, it does work and all, but it stops pretty abrubt when you let go. I'd prefer a shuttle that you can give a spin and it'd slowly slow down. If that were the case I'd use it in Priemiere and Final Cut also... but the price is right."
4,Great Product,"Excellent design, sensitive to the touch and an even better price! Highly recommended for audio/video editors of all kinds!"
3,Great Product,"For what it is, this is an awesome product. If you edit a lot of video this makes your life infinitely easier.The problem is that the setups that ship with the product are totally out of date and their webs site looks like it was developed by a 14 year old. Ultimately I got them to send me instructions on how to set it up to work with the latest version of iMovie. But getting this thing going took far far more time than it should have.The build quality is excellent and it does what it is supposed to do very well. But be prepared to fuss with it for a while before you get it working properly."
1,NOT Mac friendly...,"I bought this to use with my Macbook Pro and VLC player, Quicktime Pro, and a few other video player/editing software. I could not get it to work any of the applications, even though it has a drop down selector for numerous software titles. Also, it would not accept custom hotkeys, rather you have to press the key on the keyboard itself, and it doesn't recognize key-combinations (shift-command-left, etc...). And it doesn't accept any type of text/xtml file to create your own customized keys.I wish I could say something positive, but really, it didn't work for me--at all."
2,Not for use as an analog type knob,"I was looking for a knob that I could use for a control of an analog function... like volume, or actuator movement. The numerical value of the inner knob increases as you move left or right... wierd... If you were using it to control an actuator, it would only be able to travel in one direction... volume would only get louder, no matter which way you turned the knob.The outer knob is a jog style knob, but its numerical axis value is an interger from -7 to +7, only 15 steps, and the value sticks to the maximum value reached per jog.... it doesn't return to zero like the mechanical action would suggest."
1,Not what I expected,"This is a hard to find item. At 1st I felt lucky, but it was late arriving and then was not the version I had ordered. I did receive a refund from Amazon.com."
4,the star is easter island,"we were at easter island last year and we greatly enjoyed the movie. the story was incidental but the scenery, the scenes showing the moving of the moai (statues) and the recreation of the bird man race were wonderful. i'm delighted to have bought the dvd and am sorry that the movie didnt have more resonance. i'm afraid easter island and its culture was just too strange for the general audience. as my husband and i have been fascinated by the island and the statues since we were children -- it said much to us. for someone who expected a typical polynesian paradise romance -- it would have been a disappointment. though there was an environmental message -- it was a true one as the island still bears the scars."
3,Expected more from Costner,"Kevin Costner is a producer on this movie and I expected it would be a good film. Turned out to be mediocre. It was nice to see the locations as we have recently visited Easter Island. Acting is OK, but story line is predicable in many places. The old chief is almost a caricature.Not sure about accuracy of the Birdman Cult as presented in the movie as more recent findings indicate a different approach to the process of locating the sooty tern eggs and declaring clan winner for the next year.Authenticity included actual locations and a raft of bare breasted women.We watched it once and then added it to the bag of items being donated to the local library."
1,Poor quality,Very very poor quality picture. . it looks like a boot leg of a boot leg or someone recorded it with a VHS camcorder -You know the one's that sit on your shoulder like bazooka-. The movie is great which is sad.
1,Sophie B - what happened to ye?,"Timbre - watch out for falling recording artists! Sophie B. has, without a doubt, fallen far from the mark with her (too) long-awaited third album. Production values took Sophies voice and turned it into a motorcycle snarl - unpleasant to the ears. And what1s with this Goosebump burger and Christ-like fries business???? Isn1t she a tad old to be ranting teenage-angst BS? Where is the magic and simple beauty of songs like AS I LAY ME DOWN and BEFORE I WALK ON FIRE?? Sophie, babe, lighten up! (Oh, and PS, by the way - what1s with the back photo ofa girl and her cello - there isn1t a single cello on the album!!)"
3,"Not bad, but not her best.","Hawkins continues to amaze me with the degree to which here musical style changes from one album to the next. ""Timbre"" is no different. Unfortunately, this is not entirely a change for the better. There is an obviously darker, mellowed shadow over all the tracks, which I wasn't expecting. Also, ""The Darkest Childe"" track is far too vulgar and preachy for my tastes, and definitely a surprise from Hawkins. Musically, I still enjoy the album overall, but it is a far cry from her ""Whaler"" album... and still, nothing touches ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"" from her first album."
3,something a bit different,"sophie b hawkins seems to have gone into an experimenting stage with this release. it doesn't have the same lively beat as her other hits. this is more of a 'listen at night' kind of album. she still keeps up that harmoinous balance that keeps her reconigzed by her fans. this one didn't get me as whaler did, but it still has that feel that only her music carries."
3,Time for therapy.,"Sophie - Where did all the love go? You used to be such a sweet girl. A little too much anger and pornography for me. But Damn, I wish I could sing like you!"
1,Dark and Disappointing,"A full pendulum swing from ""Whaler"", I found ""Timbre"" an angst-filled departure from what I enjoyed most about Sophie's other offerings. Although nicely produced and engineered, it seems what once was her independence from the rest of the current pop female offerings has pushed her full spectrum to the point she too has become one of the Jewel/Tori/Melissa soundalikes. Hoping the next effort leaves behind the dark tones and returns to a more upbeat, promising style."
2,Sadly sliding into sappiness.,"Having been a loyal fan of Sophie's since hearing the opening bass of ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover,"" I was eager to hear her latest. That eagerness turned to disappointment. The songs are all too slow. No one song makes you want to shake it a la ""Damn"" or ""Did We Not Choose Each Other."" There's no passion behind the instrumentation or her delivery. It's all very arty feeling, but that artiness seems shallow, especially if one takes the time to read the lyrics in the booklet. They remind me of Jewel-style poetry, which should be banned from reproduction."
1,What Happened?,"After ""Tongues and Tails"" and ""Whaler,"" I was expecting another excellent CD from Sophie Hawkins. When I listened to the first two songs, ""Strange Thing"" and ""No Connection"" I wasn't dissappointed. They are both wonderful musically and the lyrics are poetic. Unfortunately, the CD goes downhill after these two. ""Lose Your Way"" is fair, but all the other songs could be skipped altogether. ""The Darkest Childe"" and ""Your Tongue Like the Sun In My Mouth"" are both dreadful. I don't want to hear Sophie talking like she does on ""Darkest Childe"" -- especially since it seems the words are attempting only to shock the listener. She has a beautiful singing voice and that's what I'd like to hear. Since this was her first attempt at producing, maybe that was the difference. I'll look forward to Ms. Hawkins next effort and hope it highlights her genius in the songwriting arena."
2,a bit disappointing,I haven't yet given this to my 18 month old so I don't know what his reaction will be but the food is very much smaller than I anticipated - not life-size at all. The rasher of bacon and sausage look like pieces of wood rather than anything edible. It is all much less life-like than the Melissa & Doug wooden food. Perhaps I'll update the review if my kid absolutely loves this stuff but I was a bit disappointed.
1,Don't buy this item!,"I have bought many, many items thru Amazon.com and have always trusted the stores they offer. They need to drop this one. The delivery problems necessitated me contacting them. Hardware was missing. ""Predrilled holes"" were non-existant. The assembly order was laughable as were several photos. You cannot put rockers on last! After all this, it is extremely uncomfortable! Be warned."
5,Very quick service and loved the rocker,I purchase this rocker for my son for Christmas. I was worried that it wouldn't get here on time. I emailed the sender who responded with the shipping information the very same day. The rocker arrived right on time and is beautiful. I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this product and the seller.
4,I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEARTS FOR MY DAUGHTER,"This book was great, I gave to my daughter for Christmas with a little message wrote in it, she really did like it. Great for any mother wanting to express her love for her daughter no matter the age."
3,Good book / poor CD,"I subscribe to Larry's ezine. I read and thoroughly enjoyed and prospered from reading Marketing to seniors about 4 years ago. The book here is good, not the best. The Cd however is thoroughly disappointing and lacking in content. The jokes from the book can actually be used in seminars."
2,CD contains only 5 minutes of sound,"It would be helpful if the publisher can make it clear that the CD contains only 5 minutes of sound. So people know what they are getting. The book is OK, but the CD has nearly nothin in it. No doubt, it is over priced."
5,When I Lost You,I heard this song after my husband died and I would like to get a copy of a CD with this song and any others on it. I would appreciate if you could find this song for meI would be ever so grateful.
3,Two CD's are mono and one CD is Stereo. Good sound lacking,"Although the songs are numberous and popular, digital mono recordings cannot compare with the latest stereo CD's."
3,Perry Como songs,"I'm pleased I bought this item, and am glad to have it. Mr. Como,however, is not a very good singer, and his tune carrying ability isquestionable. I bought this collection for one particular song, and it's there, so I have my money's worth."
4,I loved the sense of community,"To think that this story was inspired by a picture on a t-shirt the author's husband wore! Creative story, wonderful illustrations that underscore jazz music and the way it flows. I loved the sense of community that is revealed as C.J. searches for his uncle's hat. Both the story and the illustrations pop with warmth and color and flow soulfully together making their own sweet music."
2,Keep lookin,"As a new Dreamweaver user, I was not pleased with this book at all. The authors approach was unclear and not laid out thoughtfully. I had just gotten through the ""Flash in 24 hours"" and I was expecting the Dreameaver book to be just as good. Unfortunately ive realized that its not the series, but the author which makes a book great. Im currently half way through and Im now on-line searching for another Dreamweaver book."
1,Teach Yourself MX? Definitely Not With This Book,"I bought this book and was sorely disappointed. I am a fairly proficient computer person; this book was not easy-to-follow. Contrary to a previous review, there were no ""step-by-step"" instructions at all. It basically said ""do this"", threw up a screenshot, and it didnt say exactly how to do it. I got to Chapter 6 and I am realizing that I am going to need another Dreamweaver MX tutorial book. I'm not happy about this at all.On a related note, I have bought SAMS Teach Yourself books and have never been disappointed. This was a first. ...I plan to avoid future titles from this author based on this book. This is just my honest opinion. Good luck..."
2,Not for Newbies,"If you have never used Dreamwaever before or had minimal exposure, this book will frustrate the heck out of you. I found myself constantly thinking that I had 'missed a page' somewhere because the book was not making sense. I'm only on Day 4 and am already looking for a new book. This book is not written well and is hard to follow. So for a newbie such as myself I do not need the frustration of trying to figure out the program and the book that's suppose to make the program easier."
1,Not pleased so far,"I have found using this book to be a frustrating experience. The author's approach, while friendly, is frequently unclear. I can't help but feel that this book was edited by already-proficient computer users, not by those who are new to computers. Illustrations scattered throughout the book often serve to further obscure, rather than clarify, the author's meaning. I had little trouble with another book in the Sams series - Teach Yourself CorelDraw 8 - so I am surprised that this one seems so hard to use.I know that the author has also written the book for DreamweaverMX 2004. One hopes that she has gotten some of the ""bugs"" worked out of her most recent tutorial!"
4,A good introduction to Dreamweaver MX,"If you're looking for a book to get you started with Dreamweaver MX then buy this book.I found the book worth the money. It's a quick, easy, enjoyable, and productive book. It's broken into small segments that can be easily read during the typical TV commercial breaks.I found it quicker and easier to use than trying to go through the built-in Dreamweaver MX tutorial. Even though our Coldfusion MX server isn't ready, there is code and lessons learned that can even be used for Coldfusion 5 projects.After successfully finishing this book, then venture out and tackle the more complex, harder to comprehend, technical offerings."
2,Esperaba mas...,"Luego de leer La Nada Cotidiana y Te Di La Vida Entera, esperaba mucho mas de este libro de cuentos cortos. En lugar de publicarlos debio dejarlas para su uso personal, como una especie de dialogo interno. Solo ella sabe lo que quiso decir en muchas partes del libro, y honestamente no habia llegado a la mitad cuando ya estaba aburrida del mismo. La narrativa captura la atencion del lector en las primeras paginas, y despues se pierde el hilo, sin contar que los personajes estan pobremente definidos. A Valdes le gusta chocar a sus lectores con sus imagenes, hacerlos pensar,pero esta vez la formula no fue efectiva."
5,Wow,"After life has made me feel terrible about myself, this music has made me remember that I'm a human being not a defective machine that people can just throw away. It is somehow filled with love, compassion, empathy, and every kind of edifying emotion."
2,Old,"Unfortunately, this bottle of perfume was not new, fresh, it seemed to already have aged and smelled more like alcohol. I would not buy it from this seller again. Jess is a scent I have worn for years and enjoyed a great deal. I just learned they have recently stopped producing it and I think that is a shame as it is a beautiful scent. If the manufacturer produces it again, I would surely buy it."
5,Excellent exhibition catalog,"This is an excellent catalog of an exhibition sponsored by the Tate Gallery in 1994. There are about 115 full-page color reproductions of good quality, interspersed with commentary on selected pieces by the artist. An interesting, satisfying overview of a contemporary artist who's apparently had his ups and downs with the critics."
5,Molasses Man,I read this book to the 3rd grade class and they were spell-bound. This book was very accurate in it's description on the molasses making process. The illustrations are great also!
4,Interesting and erotic.,"This is a very well-written collection of very graphic erotica. Not for those uninterested in something of value purely for its prurient interest, nor for those with extremely outre kinks, for those of us with a concept of the erotic vaguely within standard norms -- there's a bit of kink to be found here, but nothing that anyone unbothered by a bit of homoerotica will find truly unsettling -- these stories are excellent for getting the juices flowing. Further, they actually have plots and characterization, and few if any sloppy writing errors, all of which places them far beyond what seems to be the standard in the common run of books that depict graphic sex."
1,excellent book,i read this book with my boyfriend and we loved it i dont usually like reading but just the first page got my attention!
5,Well made,"Very good material, tight spring. They hold heavy weights secure.I have purchased them before."
3,"Quick service, too small","These are about what I assumed in quality and arrived within just a few days. Unfortunately, the mouth capacity was just a bit too small for our purposes (clamping a plastic covering to a standard folding table for an outdoor consumer show). The throat depth was listed but not the mouth capacity...it turns out that is about 3/4 in. as well, possibly 1/8 in. more or so. While not very heavy duty, these would probably work well on a smaller scale. However, if you're even questioning if these might be big enough, they probably aren't."
1,Mini Spring Clamps,I ordered the same clamps maybe 3 or 4 years ago. They were nice. They were coated with the yellow vinyl instead of the black. Their spring was very sturdy and the metal was heavy and sturdy. These one here are a much cheaper version and for what you pay they should be of higher quality. They are made of light weight metal and a cheap light spring. They don't have near the clamping power as the older ones. Had I known they would be so cheap and inferior I would not have bought them. They are okay for clamping potato chip bags and cereal bags after they are opened but they are not sufficient for anything that requires a good clamping power like the old ones did. These are A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! Where can I buy the little mini yellow clamps that are heavy and really strong? I wish I knew because I still need some really strong mini clamps! I need these really small clamps but much stronger.
2,A little slow,I read all this book but it was an easy one to put down because it was slow and the plot was thin and the dialog repetitious! I found myself wanting to go to my library shelf to find a faster paced book that was a lot more interesting. I guess the simplest way to explain it is... It wasn't the most horrible book I have ever read but it wasn't the best either.
2,Dullsville.................,"O.k. Was I the only one who didn't think this book was great. The book dragged! The first 100 pages were just a struggle to get through. Then the last 200 were a struggle. A book needs to hold the attention of the reader and let me tell you that this did not. Every little distraction that came my way was a welcome repreive. I had heard such good things about this book from reading the below reviews and was really looking forward to a good book. But if you are looking for a good book, PASS THIS ONE UP. It was just plain dull and the middle cannot make up for the boring beginning and end."
4,Nice size bags!,"I love the large size of these bags! I can fit my tent, with poles in one bag, plus a sleeping bag, and there's still a bit of room left over. Haven't used them on a long tour yet. They appear durable. Only complaint - no directions came with them as to installation. had to figure that out on my own and I'm still not sure I got it right."
2,Weak,"The insights here are few and far between. Zipes labors much too hard twisting these tales to fit his own political agenda. In a typical chapter, Zipes tries to explain how fairy tales demonstrate that cats are better than people. Many better books have been written on the subject."
4,I enjoyed the movie and the soundtrack alike,"There are quite a few songs on this CD that I like. Including ""Maneater"" and ""Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For."" I think it would be a good investment to your CD collection."
4,"A nice ""Easy-Listening"" soundtrack with some surprises!","Since ""West Side Story"" and Disney's ""Mary Poppìns"", I became addicted to soundtrack albums. This one from a wonderful, light romantic comedy in which the beautiful Julia Roberts appears as gorgeous as she is, has a nice but eclectic selection of songs. Anyway, please note that there are three outstanding songs for what this soundtrack is worth: ""And That's What Hurts"", an authentic 'jewel' by DARYL HALL & JOHN OATES (not available in any of their other records or Hits compilations), ""Where Were You (On Your Wedding Day)"" by BILLY JOEL, and also the wonderful ballad ""You Sang To Me"" by Puerto Rico Salsa superstar MARC ANTHONY.There is also a cute version of the classic ""You Can't Hurry Love"" by THE DIXIE CHICKS... You will get even ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" by the superb Irish band U2. I bought this CD even when I didn't see the movie, but I was very happy when I discovered that so many great songs were included in it!"
4,GREAT TUNES!!!!,"The songs on the Runaway Bride cd are great. There's a compilation of both rock and soft rock to suit your fancy. Shawn Colvin singing ""I never saw blue like that"" is my favorite with it's beautiful melody and lyrics. And if you love Billy Joel then you'll love to hear him sing the upbeat song ""Where were you on our wedding day"" which describes a lot about what the films about, a bride running away. Sure I haven't seen the film yet but I know it's probably good with these wonderful songs in it. Amazon.com doesn't list all the songs that are on this soundtrack such as U2's ""I still haven't found what I'm looking for"", and list's Kenny Loggin's and Human Nature as being on there when their not. All in all a must buy and I now have to see the movie!"
4,Grade A Music,This soundtrack has many different kinds of music that all fit together. It's great for all ages of listeners.
3,"Please listen to ""Before I Fall In Love.""","One of the prettiest songs on this soundtrack is ""Before I Fall In Love"" by Coco Lee. She's a Chinese singer who's popular in Asia and will be making her U.S. debut soon. I wish her much success. The song is very typical and simple, but it's beautiful. I haven't seen the movie yet, but my sister says it completely describes the movie. I've heard that it won't be released as a single and am really sorry to hear that. Honestly, this is the only song I like from the soundtrack. Allure's song is okay too."
5,This is probably a GREAT CD!!!!,"Even though I have never heard this soundtrack, as a country fan I found that the song by the Dixie Chicks was one of the best songs to hit country music this year. I would definetly buy this CD just to hear that 1 song, and there's bound to be other good songs on the CD, IT'S A SOUNDTRACK!!!!! Go get this one while you still can."
4,This is an awesome CD!,"This is an excellent, well-done CD! It is even better than the Notting Hill sndtrck."
4,fun and romantic,I liked the up beat songs. It went along great with the movie and showcased some great artists. I liked the mix of eighties and nineties music.
1,Dixie Chicks murder Motown,"Sometimes one truly awful moment can ruin an entire CD. The Dixie Chicks throwing their generic white bread blandness at a soul classic (You Can't Hurry Love), indicates the Chicks will stop at nothing to enlarge their fan base. These girls make Boy groups look ultra-talented. Hopefully, the Chicks will avoid any more soundtracks."
4,This CD rocks!!,"I've really only heard the songs ""I Love You"" and ""Ready to Run"" but I like them a lot, and I'm sure that I would like the other songs on the CD if I heard them."
4,I liked it( :,"I have had this c.d. for a while now and I'm not tired of it yet! If you loved the movie,I'm sure you will want to add this to your collection."
5,Excellent product; cheap price.,"This protective silicon skin for the iPod is comparable to $20 products from the big box retailers. It provides excellent protection for the iPod, including a special protective cover for the screen. All controls operate with the skin in place. I was very skeptical that anything this inexpensive could be very good. This was better than expected and is a great value. I would recommend it."
2,POORLY MADE MIRROR,THERE ARE OTHERS ON THE MARKET THAT ARE MADE BETTER.IT WORKS.THE EDGES ARE BLURRED.....I HAVE TWO OTHER WIDE ANGLE MIRRORS MADE BY OTHER COMPANIES THAT DONT HAVE THIS PROBLEM.BEST ADVICE SHOP AROUND AND YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
3,what happened to the color version?,"I was totally disappointed upon receiving this version of Capote's ""A CHRISTMAS MEMORY."" I had trouble understanding some of the dialogue as the sound is poor in some areas. I thought I was viewing an old silent movie with some scratchy scenes. Where is a copy of this version (color!)with Geraldine Page's poignant portrayal of the cousin, that was shown on TV many years ago?Despite this version, the story is ageless!"
3,The Christmas Memory,The movie was very sweet as I had heard. The film qualitywas scratchy. Shipping information and price went to theperson who I sent it to as a gift. Not a good thing.That should have come to me as the giver.Overall I think it a positive experience.
1,No view...no review!,"I cannot review this product because I didn't ""view"" it. I ordered the movie with Patty Duke in it but I received the one with Geraldine Paige."
1,Lousy Reproduction,It's a shame such a fine story is presented for resale in such poor quality black and white. This was broadcast in COLOR and I would have assumed it would have been copied in color. Unless Mad Phat can re-issue in color they should withdraw it from their offerings.
1,Looks like a bootleg!,"I was thrilled to order this DVD of such a classic production, but then it arrived: a bare disk in a clear case, with absolutely NO packaging, looking like a bogus bootleg. Never have I received such an unprofessional product, from anyone; at the least the seller should disclose this utterly unappealing travesty, especially for such a high price. What a ripoff!"
1,Terrible Copy - Shameful - I found better DVD in Colour,"This thing selling here is a travesty. Muddy. Black and white. Plain white cover and I felt thoroughly burned. I've been in the U.S. long enough to know that everything on TV here in 1966 was in colour and thankfully I found a good DVD that included A Christmas Memory with Geraldine Page, along with the sequel. Had to search (outside the Big Brother Google ""box"") on Yahoo, then Bing, but I finally found it. Both movielead and zipzip had it. Hallelujah! I really don't understand why they allow such questionably legal and inferior DVDs to be sold here on the Amazon site. Perhaps they know something I don't, but it befuddles me..."
5,BUY THE DVD COPY - BEST COPY I'VE SEEN!,"This is one of the greatest Christmas stories as well as one of the greatest Christmas films of all time. The acting (especially Geraldine Page) is simply amazing. I have the VHS tape and the DVD version, although not perfect, is far better than the old VHS. I have only seen this film in blank and white. I'm not convinced it would be better in color as the black and white seems to enhance the mood, setting, and feeling of the poor in the Great Depression. This film is always part of our annual holiday viewing (wouldn't miss it). It is also introduced as a yearly teaching film to a class of fifth graders who love it as well. It is a film for all ages, and the DVD is worth every penny. If you haven't seen it, you are in for a rare and special treat as films of this quality don't come around very often."
1,Didn't work,My dvd player couldn't recognize the dvd.Never had this problem before. Received a refund when I shipped it back.
3,"One star for video, four for heart","There is no tale of Christmas that is warmer, sweeter, or more sad than Capote's ""Christmas Memory,"" and Geraldine Page is half the reason why. Her performance is effortlessly, almost thoughtlessly natural. Capote and his narration, the other half, seems to be a ""mere"" reporter, including very little of his own emotional involvement, but his detail and his timing make this a bright and tear-stained journey back into childhood for anyone. The video quality is abominable, and seems worse than I remember from our original VHS copy taped years ago, and recently lost. Regardless of technical problems, the richness of love amidst poverty brought out in this story make this a worthwhile purchase, ready to become an annual Christmas tradition."
3,I found the original color version!,I saw this movie years ago on PBS--and it was black and white. I tried to find the movie in the PBS Store--no luck. I did find the original color version on the website Santa Flix! That's where I am ordering my copy.
4,I love fruitcake,"Although the film quality is not great,watching it in B&W seemed appropriate as this was how I saw it in the 60's as a child. It is a heartwarming story that should be part of your holiday classic collection."
3,Amazon has details wrong,"This is the Original 1966 Version with GERALDINE PAGE, DONNIE MELVIN. Narrated by TRUMAN CAPOTE and directed by Frank Perry.. We are the sole licensed publisher for this film. We sell it wholesale to Amazon. I don't know why they allow people other than the publisher to modify the product details - It gets very confusing when someone adds wrong information!!! See our studo notes above"
5,One of the best actresses ever,"Geraldine Page has been my favorite actress since I saw her in ""Summer and Smoke"", and I have loved every movie she has ever appeared in. This sweet recollection by Truman Capote, another one of my all time favorite people, is so brilliantly portrayed by Miss Page that it quickly went down in my book as my favorite Christmas movie of all time. I was ecstatic to finally find a copy of the movie to have for my own. How sad that these days you cannot find this type of movie on television anymore. Oh sure, the networks will play to death ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and rightfully so, but what about gems like this movie, that deserve to be in the category of a Christmas Classic? If the people who program these things had any sense, they would screen this movie every single year, since it is one of the finest I have ever seen."
1,What a rip off!!!!!,"My husband copied this program way back when in COLOR. When I saw this offered, I figured I could give it to him as a present. Not only is this reproduction in black and white but the quality is very poor. My husband's old copy on VHS is of better quality than this.Perhaps Amazon should stop offering it?"
5,A book of classics,"I have loved this book for years, so I got it for a gift to special friends. It would be a great addition to any family library."
2,"ABC, REMASTER the black and white version of this film","Geraldine Page version, not the other!!! Why have you not done it by now??? GET CRACKING!!! I hope to read that this is done before I die!"
2,Poor Packaging,I was extremely disappointed when I received my order. The DVD is in a clear case with just a printed label on the disk. No outside packaging and looks homemade. Not what I expected from the picture posted on the seller site. This is suppose to be a gift for my mother who loved this production but it looks like I copied off tv. Not worth the $22.95.
1,Truman Capote's Christmas Memory,This is a very poor reproduction. It is blurry and in black and white. I'm sorry I ordered it.
1,"I Love ""A Christmas Memory"", but this copy is awful. Do Not Buy!","I had been looking for ""A Christmas Memory"" for a while and finally thought I had found something. Much to my disappointment this copy is awful, just awful. It is unwatchable AND it is in black and white and I know it is supposed to be color. I know that because I was so dissatisfied I kept trying to find a good one, and I did! It is a beautiful copy and it is in color AND they even included ""The Thanksgiving Promise"", too. Do not waste your money on this awful copy. If you want something that is worth the money go to movielead dot com. I only hope they still have it."
1,A Christmas memory best forgotten,Purchased this dvd from Amazon last year. Why Amazon would allow this seller to sell such a crappy copy is beyond me.
1,nostalgia,I saw this in the 60's when it was first released and then about 10 years later. Since then I have wanted to see it and have not been able to find it on any TV station. Its message resonates with me. It is in black and white and is centered on the friendship of an older aunt and Truman Capote as an 8 or 9 year old boy and their last Christmas together.
5,capote dvd,received the product in great time frame and gave it as a gift with much success. thank you very much. great ordering from you.dln.
3,Task Force,"Task Force is only for Gary Cooper fans. It tells the story in semi-documentary style of the birth of naval aviation. Gary Cooper is the person who grows with the naval arm and its ups and downs. It has exciting war scences and the way it was edited it looks like Gary Cooper and the cast were really there at the battle of Midway and the battle for Okinawa. Half way through the movie it turns from black and white to color. I guess it is suppose to acknowledge a new age in naval aviation. Jane Wyatt who later would play Spock's mother in the Star Trek TV series and in the movies is just around for window dressing. Walter Brennan who plays Coop's superior officer is always a joy to watch.The movie is slow in the beginning, but as I said, it picks up with WWII begins. Only Coop's fans and WWII buffs will enjoy this movie."
5,Great Movie,Am so glad this movie finally came out on DVD. It's been one of my families favorites since we first saw it on VHS. I especially like the biplane flying scenes and carrier take off and landings footage. Solid performance by Gary cooper and Walter Brennan.
4,Task Force,"This is a good movie about the development of naval aviation and carriers. Gary Cooper and Jane Wyman give their usual fine performances. The movie is a flashback of Gary Cooper's life right beginning at the time he is retiring from the Navy, going over the many memories he had in his struggle to promote carriers and naval aviation, finally to see it at its finest capability, effectiveness, and almost prolific numbers in the Pacific theater, beating down the Japanese air forces and island fortresses. It has some authentic aerial film that you see in most war flicks but still this is a worthwhile purchase to add to your war flick library and an enjoyable film to watch. Boy was Jane Wyman was really beautiful in her prime."
5,Wonderful!,"Wonderful movie, a must see for any WWII fan, a slight tour on the history of naval aviation and the history behind the aircraft carrier in the USN."
4,Who ever thought,Who ever thought that I would consider raising my grand daughter. This book has the information to help my wife and I weight the pros and cons of our decision. One of the first items we found useful was on if you are doing the right thing. After reading the right and wrong reasons and finding that we were right in line with all the right reasons we knew this was the right book. It will help anyone going though such a difficult decision.
4,Best Gameboy Color Racing Game,"I bought this to use with my Gameboy Advance, it's a great game. Great graphics and gameplay. Has rain and night/day effects."
4,GREAT!,"This game is so much fun. When I got this game, I thought it would be just another boring game, but I was wrong! It's so realistic, and the action is unbelievable. It was non-stop fun, and I would recommend this game to anyone!"
1,wasted energy,My recommendation would be to buy it used since it was written six years ago. The iconic San Francisco landmarks are still standing but much has changed and I found myself walking in circles and exasperated.
4,Profound,"If you're predisposed to think Zen is esoteric and austere, you won't like this book. If you're drawn to the elegant (and admitedly a little esoteric) simplicity of Zen this is a great read you'll find yourself returning to..."
4,Wanting Enlightenment Is a Big Mistake,"More of his delightful stories, right up there with his other book. highly recommended"
4,See this band live! Listen to their music.,I happened to stumble in on this band by accident and ended up leaving the club purchasing 2 of their CD's and am verry pleased and am looking for more like it and them.
5,Perfect,I received the product on the day I was told. It was in perfect condition. Would buy from this person again.
5,Amazing CD!!,I am a huge country fan and I really think this is one of the best CD's out there. Doug Supernaw was so talented and it is really sad that he hasn't been around for the last 10 years.
3,MUY BUENOS REMIXES!,"THE BEST REMIXES ARE FROM THE FOLLOWING ARTISTS:JENNIFER LOPEZ, RICKY MARTIN, CHAYANNE, GRUPO MANIA, DLG, SHAKIRA, IVY QUEEN, MDO Y WILL SMITH.IF YOU LIKE LATIN MUSIC, I ALSO RECOMMEND: ""PASIONAL"" BY JESSICA CRISTINA, ""SUBEME EL VOLUMEN"" BY MICHAEL STUART, ""ETERNO"" BY LUIS FONSI, ""TUYA"" BY LOURDES ROBLES AND ""TRES"" BY FIEL A LA VEGA."
3,There's a better one out.,"Ricky martin drives this one (yawn) and the mixes are just OK but if you want a Real HOT latin mix that just came out, get ""Club Caliente"" on EMI - it's even got an unreleased Selena dance track on it. And it was approved by the #1 Latin Music Magazine - Latin Beat magazine."
4,Worth the money!,This CD has you moving from the beginning. Then it mellows you out at the end with the Marc Anthony and Jennifer Lopez Duo. One of the best remix albums I've bought. The only song missing is Bailamos by Enrique Iglesias. That song would have made this CD earn a 5 star rating from me!!
3,Some Good Some Not So Much,"I purchased this CD after listening to different cuts in order to do my own at-home version of Zumba. Like any CD some of the tunes are zippier than others, but overall it's a great mix of lively music for free-form dance/exercise."
4,Ancient Video,I have been looking for a copy of the VHS version of I am the Cheese novel for several years. I not only found it; I found it in excellent condition at a reasonable price. Thanks.
4,Why Did MacNaughton Quit Acting ?,"Robert MacNaughton brings considerable charm and integrity to the role of a nerdy, geeky teen with issues. This is probably the best portrayal of a teenager in film prior to River Phoenix's brilliant performance in RUNNING ON EMPTY. (With which this film shares a certain similarity of subject matter.)In a way, he carries the whole film.Hope Lange and Don Murray are not given much to do as MacNaughton's parents, and their acting is somewhat cliched. Robert Wagner as a psychiatrist who may or may not be in sympathy with the boy, is somewhat better.There is a fine score by Jonathan Tunick, and the Vermont and Massachusetts locations are gorgeous."
2,DISJOINTED,"This film is hard to follow. It keeps jumping back and forth in time and from scene to scene. It has some interesting segments, but it wasn't put together too well...and leaves a person wanting more answers at the end. Acting was pretty good, but some characters not developed enough."
2,Fair to partly cloudy,"I purchased this movie for my better-half and I to watch on Valentines day, figuring it was a bit of a romantic movie to settle into and watch while we cuddled. We are fans of both actors and thought it would be a good movie. We were both disappointed. Now, I do believe in Love-at-first-sight. But they did not appear to be those type of people in this movie and they were not really convincing that that is what actually occurred. The ending was a bit of a surprise; but the leading ladies reaction was also unbelievable. She basically curled up and left her kids to fend for themselves after just like 4 days of know this guy...Give me a break!"
2,Utterly Predictable,"I'm a sucker for romantic stories with tragic endings. This should have worked, but it did not! I was actually so bored, that I stopped watching in the middle. Later, I watched the rest and, yes, I did know how it would end. I felt that this was truly a ""pot-boiler"". ""Just write another one just like the last one."" Too bad...pretty people and scenery though."
4,Emotionally intense,"How can you lose with Richard Gere and Diane Lane? Well for me the location inaccuracies were a bit irritating, cause you don't go over the sound bridge AND take a ferry to get to Rodanthe (on Hatteras Island). AND there are no horses in that part of the Outer Banks. In addition some may find the ending unsatisfying. (Won't put the plot spoiler in here) But aside from those two things, I still have to say I LOVED it! The chemistry, the raw look at deep personal and relationship issues, the sea, sand and a charming inn...good stuff. Also the hurricane scene was overdone and not realistic either. But having been in one and experiencing first hand the strange effects it can have on you (in a hotel very close to this locale)...still found it heartpounding and powerful. So hey, get the movie and escape into a good ole tearjerking romance!"
3,Nights In Rodanthe Good and Bad,"The movie was enthralling. The issues felt real. The acting - awesome, as expected from the two leads. Fantastic right up to the end. Why do they have to end it like that? The ending killed the movie. I would have bought it to enjoy over and over, but not now. In fact, am in general pretty tired of Nicholas Sparks. It's like happy endings are not allowed - either that or he got tired of writing and keeps killing off the men in his stories cause that'll end the book quickly. Ruins the effect of the whole thing for me."
4,"Great movie, disc in perfect condition!","DVD came in perfect condition, like new. Love the movie and being able to share it with friends! Would definitely buy more DVDs through Amazon!"
3,nicely done romantic piece,"To be honest, it was the chemistry between Lane and Gere in ""unfaithful"" that drew me to this film. It was good to see them together again. My favorite beaches are along the N.C Outer Banks area, so that too was a plus, but all that aside it was simply a good piece of film making, even if it is predictable at times. Well worth the hour and half escape."
2,SLOW AND AWKWARD WITH A MANIPULATIVE ENDING!,"Despite having a good cast 'Nights At Rodathe' never seems to get off the ground. Gere and Lane are fine actors and very likable, but I never felt any chemistry between them. I found watching the two of them fumbling around on the bed for an uncomfortable amount of time nauseating (Gere is 60). The characters are under developed and this makes for a boring first half and the ""OH MY GOD"" manipulative ending will make most viewers cry, but it made me laugh at its desperate attempt to save this mediocre film. All they needed to do is have Lane hang herself as the credits rolled to put the icing on the cake! On the plus side Scott Glen has an all too brief role as a grieving husband which is the film's best scenes."
1,Nice title -- it just doesn't work.,"Nice title, great stars (I love Richard Gere and Diane Lane), but this movie just didn't work. It was so formulaic and contrived that I couldn't get absorbed in this at all. I kept feeling bored and thinking, ""this is terrible."" This film is the worst I've seen from either of these fine actors. Between them, they've been in many two-star films, including Under the Tuscan Sun which I loved -- which were gems compared to this film. Thus, the one star."
4,"Good, excellent ---- but very sad","The movie was most excellent except------Most of the Nicholas Sparks' books I've read have a better ending, with the girl coming back to the guy, or the guy coming back to the girl.I did not like the ending and was very disappointed.I don't like movies or books that end this way. Sad. Too sad.I was hoping for a nicer afternoon when I watched it and it made me cry. Yet, it is a beautiful love story.I love the Nicholas Sparks' books, but all of them have a sad element, even the ones that turn out right."
4,Nights in Rodanthe,"Good DVD, and worth seeing, but the movie version is geographically incorrect in some places, particularly the scene driving to the Outer Banks. The house, while privately owned, is now moved to a safer location and looks very much like it did in the movie on the outside."
4,Why not keep to the book?,"I love Richard Gere and Diane Lane. They did a good job in this movie.I read the book. I was truly excited to see this movie. I really don't understand why they could not keep to the storyline the book gave us.The movies provides a good story and great acting. The book provides a much better story with more insights into the characters.All in all, I do not regret buying it. It is a good movie."
1,Another Autumn in New York,"Incredibly bad and on the same level as Autumn in New York which was a Gere film with a similar premise.The worst parts:1. No real depth to characters.2. Over the top acting/behavior during scenes when a person would not normally behave that way in real life.3. Zero chemistry between Gere and Lane and I mean zero.4. The first time the characters kissed it was so bad we started laughing. The general sentiment was, ""Now? They've chosen this moment of all moments to make out?""5. Watching Gere and Lane kiss, especially in the driveway scene, was like watching two senior citizens grappling around in the dark. Zero chemistry, zero passion, and actual fumbling. Yeach!Maybe they should cast Gere with someone he can't stand. At least in An Officer and a Gentleman he and Debra Winger were passionate even if it was only in their dislike for one another off screen. Lane has no sex appeal and her played out hairstyle and drab wardrobe in this film were awful. Skip it!"
1,Awful!,"First, let me add that I love Nicholas Sparks books/movies and all romantic movies in general. These characters however had absolutely no chemistry together. It didn't feel real like ""The Notebook"" or ""Walk to Remember"". Even the parts that were supposed to be highly emotional weren't for me because I could not connect with the characters or storyline. It was boring right from the beginning, dull, lifeless, and I couldn't wait for it to be over. Which is sad because I thought this could be great being ""The Notebook"" is my favorite movie that I can watch over and over. This you seen it once you seen it enough. Strange thing is I like both actors I just didn't fit well together. Needless, to say there was ""alot"" of things off about this movie that could have been done much better."
1,Pathetic Hollywood drivel!,This is such a lame cookie cutter Hollywood romance flick that is so commonplace these days. No character development and very little onscreen chemistry. If this is the future of Hollywood romances; how sad.

5,A 5 star review for a movie that Richard Gere couldn't resist.,"Mine is plain and simple. I agree with Amazon's insightful and accurate review. I had wondered what would lure Richard Gere back. So I made a search through Amazon and found this gem. This script and his co-star sure fit the bill for me. And, apparently, for him.Thank you for considering my opinion.S.J."
2,Skip this an watch Unfaithful for Gere/Lane excellence,"This movie was more predictable than the sun rising every morning lol...even for a light romance movie, it didn't have near the charm or appeal of say, Under the Tuscan Sun. The performances (and characters) were pedestrian and routine, and the whole movie felt like not much more than an excuse for friends Gere and Lane to work together. Get 'Unfaithful' for a leagues better movie with Gere/Lane."
2,Boring,"I felt this was a rather boring, predictable story, and very slow to get started. The only reason I watched was because of the actors, who did a great job with the material they were given. The beach scenery in NC was beautiful. The movie was disjointed in places, making me wonder for a time what was happening at that moment. I feel that Hallmark produces a much higher quality of romance movie than this."
4,These Two are Good Together,"Nights in Rodantheis worth reading, but I'm not 100% sure it's a 'must see' movie. The movie was good, but the book is better. I did enjoy Diane Lane's acting a bit more than Richard Gere's in this movie, and together their romance worked for me. I'd like to see them paired up again sometime in a romantic comedy perhaps?This film wouldn't be anything that someone who has not lived a bit could get into, but if you've felt the bite of betrayal or gotten lost in the sorrow of heartache... consider this one. A definite 'give it a try...' for the older and wiser crowd,Nights in Rodantheis something to remind us of why we should ache for more and find peace with ourselves and the world, once we've found it."
3,Book Much Better Then Movie.....,If you liked this movie or didn't read the book. There is a better story here that the film does not capture.
3,The book was better.,"This was a good movie. The acting was good by Diane Lane. However, after reading the book one would be disappointed. The movie did not follow the book as closely as I had hoped. The book was better."
3,You Guys Need to Read the Book,All of you need to take the time and read the book. I hate screenwriters coming in and changing a story so bad that the devoted readers can't find the story. They added characters and changed too many things. I wish when a best-seller is sold to make into a movie that they do not CHANGE THE STORY. The book is 5 times better....you can just imagine Gere and Lane in the characters.Why do they have to ruin EVERY Nicholas Sparks book :(
5,a story best appreciated by mature viewers,"Mature viewers are most ready to appreciate the depth and many subtleties of this artfully directed, beautifully photographed, magnificently acted story...a great film that moved my heart."
5,heartwarming,captures your heart from the begining...with real characters that make you miss them and wonder about them long after the movie is over.
1,What a disappointing movie,"My sweetie and I settled down on the couch for a good, romantic movie. This wasn't it. I found parts of it annoying, like how they didn't have the house ready for the hurricane before it hit. The scene of throwing the cans in the garbage was just stupid. And the ending was terrible.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.Such a shame, since I like both Richard Gere and Diane Lane."
2,Far fetched,I really like Richard Gere movies and always fall in love right along with his leading ladies. This movie was a huge disappointment. Not realistic or believable at all. It was also a bit boring. The ending could have been played out much better too.
3,Was hoping for better!,"When I saw it was from the same people that did The Notebook I was thrilled. I think The Notebook is the best written well acted love story of all time. I have watched it 30+ times and still get goosebumps and tears...all of the emotions. Anyway, this movie did none of that for me. I love Richard Gere and Diane Lane, but there was no chemistry... more desperateness and awkwardness. I didn't buy the depth of their connection and wasn't sad in the end. And I can cry at a good commercial....so I was disappointed! I sat there with Kleenex. Hell I cried harder in Gran Torino!! But keep trying, we need a new great love story so I can stop watching The Notebook and Bridges of Madison County!"
1,Rancid,"Just the worst! Totally mechanical, contrived plot -- and the voiceover readings of the love letters as we approach the tragic end -- gag me with a spoon. However, I give this movie one big star, for innoculating me against Nicholas Sparks; I've never read one of his books; I can thank this movie for making sure I never will."
1,"Dry, Dry, Dry","This is a rip off, the movie is horrible, its trying to be on the same level as P.S I love you. Do not see this movie, my wife and I sat through it and she is in love with these kinds of movies and there was no emotion from her at all. Do not see this, if you want to, just go see something else because you are not missing anything at all!"
4,NIGHTS IN RODANTHE,"TEAR JERKERS UNITE!!!! THIS IS A GREAT ONE. HAVE YOUR TISSUES READY BEFORE YOU START WATCHING, CUT OFF THE RINGER ON YOUR PHONE, CUT OFF THE PORCH LIGHT, AND HAVE YOUR REFRESHMENTS HANDY, YOU ARE NOT GOING TO WANT TO MOVE FROM YOUR SEAT."
4,Chick Flick Superb,Both my wife and I enjoyed this movie immensely. We will continue to enjoy it from time to time. This is a very good movie.
2,Doesn't work for me..,"I saw this in theatres with my husband and was so excited to see it because I love Nicholas Sparks books and loved A Walk to Remember and The Notebook. All I can say is that this was just downright boring-I liked the book though. And I know it really can't be the actor's faults because they had great ability to act together in Unfaithful. It just seemed long and never ending and just boring, as if the magic that makes a movie great wasn't there."
3,On the beach,"This movie didn't cut for me. Richard Gere sulked around the place and just didn't find it believable, not a movie I would recommend."
3,Cheesy,Very Predictable Nicholas Sparks Book = More Predictable Movie. It was a sappy love movie and if thats what you are looking for than it is the movie for you.
2,So disappointing!,"I am a big fan of other movies by this author, especially The Notebook and A Walk To Remember. This was not one of my favorite books so I really shouldn't have been surprised that the movie was below par. I thought the story was totally lacking and completely unbelievable. I love these two actors, but would not recommend this movie."
1,Emotion by the Numbers,"What a waste. Gere, Lane, beautiful scenery, even a hurricane, for goodness sake... but it flops. The story is more Nicholas Sparks emotion-by-the-numbers, and it adds up to less than zero. There is no sizzle between the actors, and the so the director resorts to camera tricks and mood lighting in a failed attempt to inject some life into this dead story. The only moments of genuine sentiment are when veteran actor Scott Glenn, as a grieving husband, is on the screen. He manages to convey something real; but the rest is just hollowness. Don't waste your time on this turkey."
1,The book is far superior,"This is a dreadful movie but the book was amazing, sweet and brilliant. The movie is nothing at all like the book. The essential parts of the story have been butchered beyond recognition and I wish I could erase it from my memory. Please don't watch this but read the book instead!!!"
2,"Like the actors, bummer film","I loved the premise of this film and I like both Gere and Lane as actors, so I was looking forward to seeing it. There was a decent love story and a hurricane involved. I've always enjoyed movies and books where the energy of storms ratcheted up the emotional tension, so I liked those scenes in particular.That said, what happened later in the plot was a downer. If you haven't seen it, but want to, go ahead. Overall, it's not a bad story, but be prepared for a tearjerker ending, similar to Kevin Costner's movie, Message in a Bottle."
2,Nights In Rodanthe,"I read the book first and absolutely loved it. I got lost in the characters and could not put it down. I could not wait to see the movie....boy was I disappointed!! They changed quite a bit in the movie and left quite a bit out. If you never read the book then I guess the movie is okay. If you read the book, be prepared to be let down!"
2,Waste of good actors,"I think I'd faint if Nicholas Sparks ever wrote a story with a happy ending. Even the movies made ""based on"" his books are the same. I give this 2 stars only because I love the actors too much to rate anything they do badly."
2,Did not do it for me!,"Very predicable, no chemistry between the actors and all around a waste of time for me. Hollywood just has to do better or people will stop going to see their pathetic movies that they churn out. I gave it two stars for scenery~~I love that part of NC!"
2,disappointing,"I was disappointed in this film. Were it not for Richard Gere and Diane Lane starring, I wouldn't have purchased it. They did not make good use of the beautiful beaches on the Outer Banks nor the talent of the stars. The book was much better."
3,Lots of chemisty but otherwise shaky,"A lot of romantic movies lack chemistry between the main characters. This one doesn't for sure. However, that's about the only good part of the movie. The plot seems to jump quickly ahead and things happen sort of unexpectedly and without much feeling. It seems as though everything is sort of forced and then the ending is somewhat unsatisfying. It's almost as though a whole bunch of elements were added because that's what a story like this is supposed to have, but they didn't seem very convincing. I have not read the book, so perhaps the book is a bit more developed. I was actually kind of surprised the house stood through the whole movie. It had waves lapping at the supports during good weather then a storm hits that's so violent it shakes the house and knocks a bookshelf over, but the next day it looks as if not a grain of sand has washed off the beach. Anyway, this is a watchable movie but not a great one in my mind."
1,Nice scenery......,"I'm trying to find something good to say about this film, but ""nice scenery"" is about the best I can do. I've loved both Diane Lane and Richard Gere in earlier films so I had hopes for this. The first time I played it I had to stop after about 15 minutes into it. It was the candlelight dinner that made me nauseous----what a terrible script!! One trite cliche after another. I wonder how these actors got through it? Maybe they were so glad to have starring roles at their age? Too bad. They are both attractive aging people and it would have been nice to see them in a script that honored that place in their lives. This was an embarrassment!A few nights later I thought I'd give it another try and I only lasted five more minutes....that terrible dinner!I find the Amazon review really hard to believe!"
4,"OK movie, READ THE BOOK","When the movie released I thought the preview looked so good that I bought the book. As a guy with a big heart the book was amazing! When finishing it I literally was depressed for the rest of the day. The some by Gavin Rosedale just brought back memories and reminded me of not only how sad the story was, but how inspiring it was. Overall I rented the movie and was disappointed. The filming was poor in my opinion and it just didn't flow the way the book did. I recommend seeing the movie if you desire, but definitely reading the book."
5,A Good Night,"At first I thought the movie was a little slow, but I liked the area where it was filmed, I've been there and love it. I have to admit, I would be a little nervous in a hurricane though, lol. It wasn't till half way through the movie that it started to pick up. I really liked it and would watch it again. Christopher Meloni's part was too small, I would have liked to see more of him. Gere was terrifc too."
2,Nights movie,"Thin plot. Predictable ending. Beautiful setting. Recent hurricanes certainly didn't look this romantic. Shouldn't make anyone want to ""ride it out."""
1,Nights in Rodanthe.,childish love story. Nights in Rodanthe. More like a made for TV soap opera. Don't waste your money. Very stupid film.
4,chick flix,Good story nice scenery but too sad the ending. How can you go wrong with a movie that has Richard Gere starring ?
4,Nice date night movie with your significant other,This is a lovely and heart touching romantic movie. The acting of Gere and Lane really draws you into the characters. Break out some wine and share this one with your spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend.
2,Why isn't James Franco listed in the credits?,"I found it quite surprising and interesting that James Franco asDr. Fanning's son, Mark, was not listed in the credits at the end ofthe movie. The credits list others who had extremely minor walk-on roles buttotally ignore Franco. How can this happen? Is it a huge oversight orintentional for some reason? Very curious."
1,Disappointed,I was so disappointed in this movie. I love both Richard Gere and Diane Lane. The scenery was beautiful. That is probably the best I can say about this movie. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. Very boring!
2,Not good for US 505 owners,"This manual is primarily for European models. There is very little coverage of some of the more popular US models -- particularly the diesels, turbodiesels, V6 and Turbo models. Given the price, you're much better off looking for the factory manual on eBay. Nice pictures, though!"
2,Was said to work with iphone it didn't,I read carefully that this was to work with my iphone so I can watch my purchased movies on my tv but it did'nt work mainly because most all of these things don't unless there apple. It's good for using w my ipod.
1,If you have the older generation ipod it may work,"I read the other reviews about it saying that it would only work for the earlier generation ipods, but saw some that said that it would work for the newer ones and believed them. Figured it was cheap enough that it wouldn't be that big of a loss if it didn't work. If you have an 80gb, DO NOT buy it, no matter what any of the other reviews say, DO NOT buy this, it WILL NOT work!!!"
1,Item not as advertised,"Beware of this product. It is not as advertised. According to the Griffin website, this cable only works on 5th generation iPod with video and 4th generation iPod photo having the video out function through the earphone jack. The Amazon description states that the cable is for all ipods and iphones with video out features. It did not work on any ipod or iphone of mine."
1,Not compatible with iPod Classic,"This cable does not work with the iPod classic. After not being able to figure out the problem, I checked the Griffin website for troubleshooting tips and it stated that this does not work with the classic, touch or 3rd generation nano.since this was listed under the Better Together section on this page I assumed they were compatible."
4,Nice ornament.,The ornament arrived on time and was just what we expected. We would recommend this product/vendor to others. Happy with our purchase.
4,"Nice, Smooth and Refined","Heather provides her consistent brand of soothing husky vocals over her 3 boys' piano tinkling and saxophones. This is basically a collection of songs from past albums -- most of which seem to come from their last U.K. album, ""Fresco"" (which was unreleased in the U.S. and rumored to have been too heavy on R&B for their pop fans). As singles, these songs all play nicely, and I would have thought this was a slow and lite retrospective (like Madonna's ""Something to Remember"" album), if it weren't for the extra remixes thrown in to keep this CD from coming across as too dreary. The best remix is another release of ""Moving On Up - (Mark's Millennium Vocal mix),"" very fun indeed! Overall, I can't help thinking that I would rather have preferred to buy their ""Best Of M-People"" CD on import instead. It's got many of these same songs, plus their other big hits -- yes, Amazon.com sells that one, too, and only for a couple of dollars more."
3,grows on you,i have been a loyal m people fan for quite some time now...was very excited to see this new ced..but was a bit miffed with the remixes of songs i already had...but 'testify' and 'dreaming' make up for it. i love listening to 'dreaming' really loud on my way back from a hard days' work!
2,Good M People but too much old stuff,I am a huge M People fan but am a bit disappointed in their latest release. I was hoping for more upbeat songs. Many of the track are remakes or remixes of other artists or old M People stuff. I would much rather hear new and original tracks. Bring us some new stuff M People!
1,The truth as it should be told,"This study presents a fair and balanced discussion on Islam and Spencer's impecable scholarship in citing instances of genocide is true and accurate to the very word. Moreover, any reader would appreciate the fact that Islam is intolerant to a high degree, it is common wisdom so I wonder why we need to discuss this further, after all, it is the fastest growing religion, which makes this notion of intolerance all the more stronger.Spencer shows he understands the word 'jihad' so completely that you would feel there is nothing more you would want to know about Islam, after all Muslim writers only present a one-sided view, in Western 'scholarship' this is unheard of. I recommend readers to find all the truth on Islam in this book, you need to look no further.O get real, this is a showcase of sloppy work, I would like to call it fiction but than again I would not like to offend fiction."
1,Islam,"Alright....I truly truly fail to understand this book. I myself am a Muslim and have grown up in a mUslim community all my life. I was taight how to read the quran and have read many books on Islam. Not a single on of those books, including the Quran, taught me to hate non-Muslims. I have been taught to respect the religions of non-Muslims and respect non-MUslims, esepecially Jews and Christians. As a Muslim, I can tell you that my reliegion teaches us to love other people, not hate them. If you truly want to read a good book, read the Quran. Go to www. cair-net. org to get your free copy."
5,They must be crazy,I use too not read alot until my dads job puts him in an area with lots of these wackos. He is retired Army and has for the past 12years told me that you should know who your enimies are.I had to ask a lot of questions but he was there to help.Great Book!
3,Moist and good but..,but I prefer richer brownies made with butter and more toppings/chocolate. These tasted store-bought with vegetable fat and I wasn't so pleased with some of the toppings. But they were big and soft and all were eaten!
2,Dated,"In it's time this was probably THE reference for writing term papers, but with the passing of time, it has become dated. With information on such things as footnotes, it is simply not up-to-date with the styles currently in use at most colleges. Probably manuals such as the Beacon Handbook or the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers would be better reference choices."
1,Student;'s Guide for Writing College Papers,"I was disappointed with this book for several reasons:1) It was written pre-video, pre-internet; therefore, many aspects of incorporating sources into class papers lack any directives by Turabian.2) While sharing the ""what not to do's"", this book lacked many ""to do's"". For example, in the footnoting section, she indicated when not to use Ibid., but the book lacks specific direction on what to do.3) Information is not easily accessible for specific points...lots of searching to find where the information is located in the book.While eventually you get to the information you need, I found myself using my ""best guess"" in writing my papers and hoping for the best. I had hoped that this book would build my confidence BEFORE I submit my student work. Unfortunately, my university using the Turabian method!"
5,finally!,"Currently Nameless fans had to wait a while before the band finally released their first studio album--- and it was well worth the wait. This album is a great representation of the bands rock/blues/funk/psychedelia grooves, and anyone who enjoys decent music will want to have a listen. ...GET THIS ALBUM!!!"
5,From placing an ad to confirming a sale,"Got a boat to sell? Then you will want to give a close reading to Thomas Cook's Sell Your Boat In 30 Days!: Minimize Your Investment, Maximize Your Profit. Cook knowledgeably covers a variety of ""how to"" issues ranging from preparing the boat for a new owner; doing paperwork; pricing the boat; advertising and salesmanship; to negotiating with prospective buyers; finding new markets for selling boats through the online resource of eBay; brokers; consignments sales, trade-ins, donations, and other boat disposal alternative. From placing an ad to confirming a sale, Sell Your Boat In 30 Days! takes all the guesswork, anxiety, and risk from the process of selling any watercraft of any kind."
2,Not really a textbook...,"I had to purchase this book for a course I was taking, Working with the Deaf-Blind Community. I would not say that it was particularly helpful. There were a few tips that were handy, but they would take up about two pages maximum. The majority, by which I mean 99%, of this book is just the authors personal experiences - it is much more an autobiography and ""Look at how great I am!"" book than anything to learn from. It really is too bad that there are not more books on this topic, for this book really does not do the subject matter justice or teach much of anything."
1,live drums ruin it,"this is the day..., and cure for sanity were two of my fav albums of all time and i was really looking forward to getting this one when it first came out. i was really disapointed cause the songs weren't nearly as strong and for me the live drummer just doesn't work. what i loved about PWEI was the way they sampled awesome drum beats and when they stuck a live real drummer in there it just...i don't know, ruined the whole thing for me. i really wanted to like this album. i tried hard but couldn't. didn't really like much that they put out after this either...but at least i will always have my cure for sanity and this is the day...and no one can take those away from me."
4,Instant Immersion Spanish Platinum,"For the money (this was on sale on Amazon for $25), an ubeatable value, with more than 750 hours of exercises. This is essentially the same Tell Me More software sold by Auralog for $200 and up. However, it is probably best used as an adjunct for learning pronunciation and vocabulary in conjunction with a traditional didactic course. Some may find the interface a bit confusing at first, but once this hurdle is crossed, a very good learning experience awaits."
4,Pleasantly surprised,I paid hundreds less than what I would have paid for Rosetta Stone. I studied Spanish all throughout high school. I've been using this product for about six weeks. I have made a lot of progress. I'm confident that this product can get me to where I want to be as far as becoming fluent in Spanish.
2,Check the discs,Check your discs before starting. I was going through the 11 discs that came in the box to discover that I had two of the audio disc 6 and none of the software disc 2!
1,Cheap and Extremely Poor,11 CDs no user manual. Complete BS in starting w/CD 1. No structure just pictures and spanish. Waste of money. Even if it's cheap it's BS
1,Unsatisfied,The description gives the impression that the CD-Rom started you from the basics. The truth is that the CD-Rom is nothing but exercises. You are to learn how to speak the language by listening to the audio CD's. I have decided to purchase Rosetta Stone. I hope this deters you from purchasing this product like I did.
5,A Favorite In Our Car!,"Nearly all of the kids' classics are covered on this album, which features such Sesame Street favorites as Big Bird, Elmo, Telly and Zoe.This album -- which includes such songs as ""I've been working on the railroad,"" ""Old MacDonald,"" ""Oh Dear, What Can The Matter Be,"" and a cute ""ABC, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Ba Ba Black Sheep"" medley -- has become a mainstay on car trips.Festive and fun, the sing-a-long type tunes keep toddlers entertained and happy! A must-have for Sesame Street fans."
5,Where's Captain Spizzenergi?,"Sometime in the 1980s there was a concert, or rather a series of concerts, featuring current punk/new wave/alternative acts, or rather featuring punk new wave act Spizzenergi (THE SPIZZLES, ATHLETICO SPIZZ 80).The Spizzenergi Live show was recorded at the Lyceum Ballroom.Where's Captain Spizzenergi?"
4,Very comfortable,"Those shoes are really comfortable and very light! Tan colour is not the best, but looks nice anyway. I recommend them."
5,comfort and fit,"These shoes are really comfortable and long lasting. My husband have special inserts in his shoes, and finding a shoe that fits the insert and comfortable can be challenging. This shoe fits the bill in both areas. This is our second pair through Amazon, we haven't found a better price than Amazon. The shipment was fast. Absolutely no complaints."
4,Hush Puppies Shoe,"This company is great! fast service, and the shoes are very comfy! just what i expected!!!"
2,The last ones got deformed... let's give them another chance,"These were for my dad.He loves Hush Puppies and, specially, this model of shoes.The last ones we bought got the sole deformed before 1 year. But he decided to give them another chance and buy another pair of the same shoes.As for now, they are OK."
1,WW Size is wrong.,I need an EEE width.The Amazon search engine claimed that WW was the same.WW is not the the same as EEE.The shoes are too tight.
3,Hush Puppies is not my favorite brand anymore,These shoes are so light you don't feel them on you but they also deteriorate so fast you may think they are made of paper.
5,My favorite shoes.,"These are by far my favorite shoes. I always have to have a pair.They have such a great look that fits many occasions from going to work, to going to school, to going to parties. They look good for everything!"
4,It is nice and confortable,"Very nice, light weight and confortable shoes which is my thanksgiving gift offered by my wife. Would like to buy another pair."
5,MUST HAVE BOOK FOR NUT LOVERS!!!,"This has been one of my favorite purchases from Amazon. If you love nuts you will love this quick, easy, savory, sweet cookbook. There is a seasoned nut in it for everyone and the ingredients are simple and few. Highly recommended, your friends and family will think you are a nut genius with these recipes!!"
5,An essential addition to my cookbook collection!,"Sally Sampson has packed more good ideas into a small volume than just about any other cookbook author I've read in years. Party Nuts is beautifully produced, but more importantly, it's well written and sharply edited. Stripped of the self indulgent fluff of so many cookbooks, Party Nuts provides such a welath of wonderful, simple, sweet and savory recipes that it's nearly impossible to decide where to begin. The photography is elegant and appropriate, and the book has that nice snack-size feel that makes me reach for it every time we have company.This is a superb book and I highly recommend it to anybody who likes to entertain!"
3,personal anecdotes,"I know the book is titled ""My Camino"" but I didn't care for all the personal anecdotes. Also the comparisons of being on a rowing team and the pilgrimage walk somehow didn't mesh."
1,One of the worst films ever made,"""The Pit"" is probably the worst film I've ever seen. The plot is moronic - the movie apparently tries to make a statement, but it generally comes of as so ridiculous as to be laughable. The film concerns a boy whose teddy bear talks to him and tells him to feed some ""tra-la-logs,"" little goblin-gorilla type creatures, in a pit out in the woods on the edge of town. Guess what they eat? Yes, that's right, this boy is quite a psycho and he pushes/tricks several people into the pit. This movie has absolutely no entertainment value unless you're into camp (as am I). In that case, it's highly recommended. On the upside, the performances are actually pretty decent and the ending is great."
5,These two episodes were really good for any Brady lover.,"These episodes were really good, particulary because Cindy is my favorite character, and ""The Tattletale"" is focused around Cindy. In ""Law and Disorder"", Bobby wants to be a good safety monitor, but becomes really bossy at school and at home. He goes too far, but then he saves a girl's cat, and in doing so, he breaks a rule and rethinks the concept of rules. ""The Tattletale"" is about Cindy tattling on other people so much that the Brady kids start avoiding her. Then she tries to stop tattling so much that she almost loses something that is important to Alice."
1,Oh man! Ever heard of Beta testing!?,This was supposed to be a fun game. In many retrospects it is especially when your online and playing against other people! YEAH! I just love sneaking up and blowing them away. The problem unfortunately is that when I bought the game it was totally messed up. It had several problems including the fact that the video movies couldn't play right. Many errors where found. Can you say Beta testing?! Obviously not considering it was an independant game. Probably a college project by the looks of things. Unfrotunately what could have been a good game is simply put ruined by many errors.
5,Priceless,"I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to know that the real New Orleans is about. Many of the songs are funny even if you weren't from there.For anyone from New Orleans, this CD is required. The NOPD is searching houses, so you'd better have yours."
2,"Oversimplified, one-sided sales pitch","I read this book from cover to cover before opening my own franchise. In hindsight, I admit that this book gave some pretty horrible advise. It doesn't give you a real sense of how to investigate a franchise, nor does it prepare you for the negotiations with the franchisor. It doesn't help you to really evaluate a franchisor nor does it explain the myriads of pitfalls that can befall a franchisee.This book really was a light-hearted sales pitch to encourage you to buy a franchise. It doesn't really explain the advantages of running your own business sans the franchise system.After reading this book, I was still a dummy and made one of the worse mistakes in my life when I purchased a Friendly Computers franchise."
4,One of the Best Franchising books ever !,This book is very very good. A broad approach to all Franchising aspects. And it brings a very useful CD with it. Very good buy.
2,"Good, but not what I needed to find the right franchise","I found this book to be adequate in some areas and lacking in others. The challenge that I had was when I had a question the book does not supply me with an expert to ask questions of and it tended to raise more questions for me than it answered.With a little bit of research, and Google, I found an expert consultant, George Knauf who was able to help me understand franchising and find the right businesses to meet my goals out of the thousands of possible franchise choices in the market.And, unlike the book, the advice didn't cost me anything!Use the book to raise questions, then find some good advice. Don't go it alone when making this kind of decision, I didn't."
5,Wonderful!,"I have a passion for the ancient Biblical manuscripts, and this work by Reuben Swanson is amazing! To be able to view some of the most important Greek Biblical manuscript readings all in one glance is something that I truly appreciate since I have spent many hours sifting through photocopies of Unical manuscripts with no spaces between letters and no punctuation. I can not even imagine how long and pain-staking it must have been to put this work together. If you read the Greek New Testament then I highly recommend collecting Swanson's works. This will allow you to easily see the variant readings found in the ancient manuscripts. Swanson has set an amazing new standard for textual criticism!John Litteral"
4,A paranormal murder mystery,"Vanish with the Rose is an astounding murder mystery with a twist of paranormal. My sister recommended this book and what a wonderful adventure. The basic story is about a lawyer who pretends to be rose expert to solve a haunting mystery. You have mix of murders, ghosts and amazing friendships. She finds herself falling love with the old house and developing compassionate friends. I would recommend this book and I would also suggest The Ice House by Minette Walters."
5,Just Excellent,"This was the first of Barbara Michael's books that I ever read, and what a way to start! This book is incredible, very intelligent, well researched, and completely entertaining. I have since read all of her books, including those under Elizabeth Peters, and I have yet to be disappointed. If you want a book to make you think, I reccomend snagging this one."
3,"It was good, but it could have been better . . . .","I am an extremely dedicated fan of Barbara Michaels, and in my opinion this is not one of her better books. The overall plot was good, but I didn't really think there was enough reason for the haunting ghosts and the dancing music associated with Martha Fairwether. I also thought it would have been a whole lot better if Diana ended up with Walt instead of Andy, because the latter is sort of a dufus. If you really want a great Michaels book, check out the following: OUT OF THE DARKNESS, WINGS OF THE FALCON, BE BURIED IN THE RAIN, SONS OF THE WOLF, and THE GREY BEGINNING"
2,Inflated volume does not a good book make ...,"Has the author sold out to ""commercialism""? Such rambling on and on and on .... Finally, after almost 1/3 way through the book, the reader is told why Diana is posing as a landscape artist (even though it's easy to get this fact by reading the Synopses Amazon has kindly provided!). I could not finish this book; didn't even bother to find out how the story ends.I could not help but think that since Ms. Michaels is a ""bestselling"" author, her publisher got her to write ""another"" book, as many pages as possible so that the publisher could justify charging more for a 400+ page paperback.No, this book does not measure up to what the author is capable of. I have read and enjoyed two of her ""Amelia"" books, written as Elizabeth Peters."
3,Too noisy,"I didn't like this one as much as Michaels' Victorian-era gothics. It was too noisy, the 4 main characters, who are only half likable, were always sqabbling. The protaganist and her friend were both *itches and treated the men very rudely. In real life, these guys probably wouldn't have stuck around unless they were masochists. The older characters and some of the side characters were likable and interesting. The mystery and some of the other stuff--antiques, vintage clothing, stories about roses, were beautiful, and really kept me going. But it had to be read in small doses because of all the noise."
2,Not Michaels At Her Best,"I was disappointed in this book. It just didn't hold together. There were too many elements mixed in - romance, the supernatural, murder, but it didn't tie in the end. The romance was vague and I couldn't understand why the protagonist chose Andy when it looked like Michaels was setting her up with Walt. Michael's characters as usual were wonderful but as a whole it fell far short of her other, excellent work. Nonetheless, she is a wonderful writer. I remain a big fan."
1,sometimes a rose isn't a rose,"I'm not a romantic suspense reader, so perhaps I shouldn't comment on a book in a genre I'm not familiar with. But I am a novel reader, and as a novel this one is junk. The plot is both creaky and preposterous, the logic of the murder mystery ridiculous, the constant (and tedious) squabbling of the lovers-to-be a bad omen for their various futures, the ""psychic"" prognostications too silly for words. Even worse are the epigraphs invoking roses at the beginning of each chapter: clearly the author opened her Barlett's and simply typed them out in sequence without any attempt at relevance to actual events about to take place."
3,"Good film, rubbish dvd","Scott Richardson (above) writes that this is one of Waterbearer's better quality DVDs. In which case I certainly won't be buying any of their others!It is a shame such a low quality product should represent the work of such a great director. Let's hope somebody brings out a remastered version, restored to full length, with chapter stops (how much effort would it take to put them in!) and removable digital subtitles. And it would be nice to hear that Morricone soundtrack clearly.Come on Waterbearer, try a bit harder."
2,not impressed,"This is not very practical for hanging a ""real"" towel on! The hanger knob broke off when I opened the package, and the entire item is really very flimsy."
2,"An ok book, but a little dry","In this book, I really enjoyed the history of syphilis and how it was treated back in the day. That is where the two stars come in. However, towards the middle of the book I was getting sick of her trying to twist every little illness into a symptom of syphilis. Oh Shubert had the sniffles....MUST BE SYPHILIS. Lincoln was depressed.... MUST BE SYPHILIS. I am sorry to say but not everything was syphilis back then. Like Mary Lincoln for example, her husband was shot in the back of the head while he was sitting next to her.... I don't blame her for going mad! A lot of her points are overkilled, and don't make sense. These are one of those books that you can pick up in the middle and read a chapter and not miss anything. I think in every chapter she explains the symptoms and every detail of syphilis. I would recomend another book"
5,"I loved the CD!! I especially loved ""Feeling Good"".","""Hate"" is a great piece and ""Happy Birthday Maggie"" is strangely calm and yet dangerous. Great CD!"
2,I expected more from Plantronics...,"So, after looking long and hard for a good quality headset for a pretty good price I sprung for this one...I've heard great things about Plantronics' audio technology and quality, but this one missed the boat.The fit and overall construction are awesome, easily one of the most comfortable headsets I've ever tried, very stylish too, but the sound quality of both the speaker and the microphone are muffled and people say I sound like I'm in a fish bowl when compared to my cheap $10 headset. I hear others as if they're in a fish bowl too, whereas my other headset sounds crystal clear on both fronts. Only reason I got this one is because my other headset is horribly uncomfortable.I guess you just can't have your cake and eat it too in the world of headsets. :("
1,Roy,Everyone complained that they could not hear me very well. Transmitting sound worked better if I cupped my hand over the mic. Ear mic worked very good. It may be the unit didn't work with my Panasonic kx-tga560b. For what they charge for the unit it's a rip off. Save your money or give it to charity.
2,disapointing,"I bought this since I have 2 plantronics phones, and one of them was missing the head set. I am on the phone about 5 hours a day, and my clients have complained about the sound quality. I have tried different positions with this, and am considering sending it back. I am surprised and disapointed in the product"
3,Too technical,"Having worked with many classical singers, tabla players and other traditional masters of Indian music, I was very disappointed in this production. There was no time to learn about the people in the film, their training, experiences and performances, and the music exploration was extremely technical. While this would be good for a young student beginning to study this historical art form, for a non-Indian person interested in the music form it was overwhelming. I was also disappointed that I did not learn more about the people talking in the film."
2,Did not like it,"Too much excitement in the movie... too little facts, too much blah-blah. Some good historical figures and a little good history."
1,Raga Unveiled,"Personally I found this DVD very disappointing. With the great Ravi Shankar and Ali Akbar Khan heading the list of photos on the cover, I expected some wonderful music. However there was but a few seconds of these artists in the programme. The rest was just endless talk espousing Indian philosophy, great if you are into this, but not if you are looking for some enriching musical performances."
2,ABC News Nightline guarding the fallen: The national guard,"First of all I am disappointed in the descriptions you have on your products, especially the DVD's. It does not give enough information to figure out if this is what you are looking for. It wasn't what I was looking for. It gives an overall view of what the guared does and I was looking for more detail.Secondly the DVD skips.I recently ordered two more DVD's from you but went to other sites to get more detail on the contents.FOrtunately, you were the cheapest in price. But next time, I just may order from the other vendors.I"
1,Do Not Buy This CD collection,Save your money and get a better selection. Disc 1 is identical to Disc 4 and the quality of all discs is awful. It sounds like someone put a microphone up to an old record player and put it onto CD.
5,I love this CD,"It's amazing how these artists never really blew up back in the day. I play this CD all the time, especially good in the car or cleaning the house. Very upbeat. I love track 2 and track 7. But the whole CD is really good."
5,Aqua Mix High gloss sealer is without a doubt the best thing I have ever put on my porcelain tiled kitchen floor.,"Aqua Mix High Gloss Sealer is without a doubt the best thing I have ever put on my porcelain tiled kitchen floor. It gives great shine and keeps even high traffic areas looking new. It is not slippery, which is a very important thing due to my husband being disabled."
3,A quick way to hear the most of the 1st 3 T. Dream LP's.,"This contains most of the 1st 3 LP's by this band when they were playing pure deep space music. It does contain a 20 minute unreleased track called ""Green Desert"" that makes it worthwhile for more than just a rehash of the 1st 3 LP's. Good to get an idea of where it all began."
1,analogue space years,"i was expecting up beat tech. like dream encores, but the year should have been a hint 69-73 disco i think not"
5,Amazing review of factor analysis in depth and width.,"Presents a variaty of subjects in a concise and well defined manner. It unifies many methods like PCA, factor analysis, arma modeling and others. It is best suited to people with good math background for which too many words without exact definitions means nothing. I found this a problem in many factor analysis texts. Its only disadvantage is that the terminology is slightly different than the usual one. Overall, it is worth every cent of it !"
3,convenient but flimsy,"The art tube works as described. It will not collapse easily, but it is pretty thin so it could crush if one is not careful."
3,it's okay,"It's okay. average, not so great pictures or words. Doesn't really catch my daughter's eye, nor mine. Too bad. We still read it though"
4,One year old loves it...,My one year old loves this book. He will bring it to me for me to read. Todd Parr books are so easy for a liitle one to understand and holds their attention wonderfully. I highly recommend any of his books.
1,AVOID!,"Wow. This is one cheap doll. I highly recommend everyone (no matter how big of a Munsters fan you are) to AVOID this doll. It broke - LITERALLY - the first time I touched it. Save yourself the hassle of returning this terrible item and avoid this doll. Herman Munster is eternally cool, but this thing is the worst!"
4,The Memory of a Killer,"Interesting but the subject is a bit revolting. Dealing with Alzheimers was a new twist and the story was well presented. The European air left me with a bit of a ""who cares"" whim but it was time well spent."
4,Excellent for the price,"These are sufficiently well made - the metal was free of defects or blemishes and the springs have plenty of grip. The vinyl coating on the jaws is very thin, and prone to stick to itself when the clamps are closed. Otherwise I would have given them five stars."
2,Looks can be deceiving,"Not the right clamp for me!The sales picture showed orange vinyl (capped) spring clamps, very similar to the ""Pony"" brand color spring clamps. What was substituted, arriving promptly was red vinyl (brushed-on or dipped) spring clamps.What had been advertized as heavy duty vinyl covered caps were actually lightly brushed-on or dipped red liquid vinyl coverings. The metal clamping edges actually cut thru the brushed on vinyl exposing sharp edges on several of the fifteen clamps ordered.Clamping pressure was great, except I cannot afford cuts and scratches on the wood work or myself, I sent them back for re-credit.Although I also ordered a smaller sized fifteen piece spring clamp set. Here the color matched the sales picture! These had a better quality (brushed-on or dipped)vinyl coverings."
4,Decent,"I bought the 4"" version of these as well, and the 4"" have significantly more force behind them.these still work, but they aren't too ""Heavy Duty"""
5,An Updated review,Oops-I got the coloring books mixed up; my earlier review relates more to HP and the Sorcerer's Stone coloring adventures (Friendship) with glitter glue. this one with Hagrid is much better. Nice detail in Hagrid's hut and at Gringott's bank. Also the Dursley's appear in it!! This one is a must buy.
3,"disappointing ""art""","Coloring books are for kids who like to color. From simple to complex, the excitement is always in the details. Unfortunately this coloring book is boring--the pictures usually have no background and oftentime just have pictures of faces and heads or the characters in their school robes (which by description in the book are black--not all that interesting for coloring). If it weren't Harry Potter, it would be a total bust. But since it is, of course there is some interest and reason to purchase. And the tattoos are fair to good."
2,Compilation of 1970's RCA material only,"Paul Anka had a bunch of hits in the '70's, but most were on United Artists and are not included here. This CD collects tracks from his RCA albums from that decade: a non-charted 1970 LP (most likely ""Paul Anka '70's""), 1978's ""Listen To Your Heart"", and 1979's ""Headlines"".The track listing:1. Medley-Before It's Too Late/This Land is Your Land2. Midnight Mistress3. Rainy Monday4. Anna May5. Starmaker6. This Is Love (#3 AC, #35 pop, 1978)7. Don't Ever Say Goodbye8. Starting All Over Again9. As Long As We Keep Believing (#29 AC, 1979)10. AndiThis appears to be the only place to get ""This Is Love"" on CD."
5,RCA songs from The 70's,"Featuring songs from his RCA releases in the 70's including tracks from 'Listen To Your Heart', 'Headlines' and more.Songs:1) Medley: Before It's Too Late/This Land Is Your Land ;--2) Midnight Mistress ;--3) Rainy Monday ;--4) Anna May ;--5) Starmaker ;--6) This Is Love ;--7) Don't Ever Say Goodbye Again ;--8) Starting All Over Again ;--9) As Long As We Keep Believing ;--10) Andi."
2,Javier Solis,"The quality of the recording is very harsh. There is not enough base and it sounds 'tin ish"" I have other Javier Solis CDs and they sound much better. Why is that? I bought 2 CDs of Javier S. Rancheras con J. Solis, and Mexicanisimo from Amazon and they both have a inferior quality sound. However, the songs are great!!!!"
5,Great bench!,"Can't beat the price vs quality ! It's a solid, sturdy bench I use for a lot of weight lifting. I imagine if your a big guy you would want a wider bench. I'm 5' 11"" 195lbs and I've had zero problems. Really impressed with this."
2,I wish I had read the reviews first,"If I had known this product could only support 300 lbs, I would have held out for something more expensive and sturdier. My fault for not reading the reviews, lol! I tried to cancel it but it was too late. Anyway, I received the bench last night, put it together exactly as instructed. It is a nice bench for the price w/ free shipping, and it was very easy to assemble. Use with caution, check the bolts periodically, and stay under the weight capacity. For the more experienced bench pressers, I don't recommend this bench.**UPDATE**This bench sucks. THE END."
1,Missing parts,"Received parts but assembly hardware, nuts, bolts, etc. missing. Called manufacturer and they offered to send in 5-10 days. No thanks - no sense of urgency on their part so I returned the bench"
1,Apex flat bench. Leg buckled underneath.,"As with several other reviewers on here, one of the legs folded underneath the bench while I was using this product and the bench collapsed on one side. Please see the picture I uploaded in the Amazon gallery and the other pictures of this phenomenon from different users before purchasing this product.The design of this bench and the weld type, specifically where the legs meet the bench, does not seem to be intended for anything beyond light beginner weight use. I bought this bench used and I did not get a manual so I cannot attest to the weight limit warnings this product might have. However, I did not see any low weight limitations posted on the informational tags underneath the bench.I weigh around 190 lbs and bench reps of around 225 lbs. I had used the bench for just over a month before it failed.BOTTOM LINE: If the sum of your body weight and the weight you will be lifting is ANYWHERE NEAR (or beyond) this total (415 lbs), DO NOT GET THIS BENCH."
2,Not very sturdy,"Worked well for about 6 months. Then as I was getting up off the bench, the front leg broke from the weld and buckled under. Then I fell to the floor. Its a good thing there was no weight in my hands or I could have been seriously hurt. I do not recommend this bench unless you reinforce the legs by welding or some other method. Also if you are over 6 feet tall, you will find this bench a little short."
1,Garbage,Not much good for even sitting on much less benching. Legs started spreadin was unstable from the git go. Unsafe
1,Dangerous and weak,"I purchased this item and assembled it just as the instructions recommended. However, when I lay down on the bench to grab a bar, the legs started wobbling. I weigh just under 160 lbs, and without any additional weight the legs began to buckle. This bench is irresponsibly weak and dangerous, and I strongly caution anyone from purchasing it. I am already running into trouble with my return process to boot, so I get the feeling that I am paying for the lesson here of not buying cheap weight equipment."
3,"ok, but not great","this bench is ok, but needs more padding. It works fine for chest work when you are on your beck, but for back, lats moves that use on knee on the bench to stabilize you, the lack of padding shows up, as before you finish one set your knnee is killing you."
2,"Cheap, but wobbly and only 300 lb","Cheap, fixed bench for basic lifting. Beware, mine didn't sit flat on the floor after assembly, and wobbles a bit. It also only supports up to 300 lb, meaning a 150 lb person could only bench 150 lb or so safely (yes, the feet carry some of the weight, but we must be cautious). Good, inexpensive beginner's bench though."
3,It was the wrong item!,"It was not what I intended to purchase,never took it out of the box,not saying if its good or bad!"
1,Missing hardware,"Overall the quality of the bench is fine (for $40). But as the title states, it was missing hardware when it arrived. It was missing 6 washers, 2 bolts, and 2 plastic end-caps for the supports. Luckily, I was able to supplement what was missing with my own miscellaneous hardware. Furthermore, you will need a socket set, or at the very least a crescent wrench to put this together properly, if you get all of the pieces, that is. It stands a little low to the ground for me at about 16 1/2 inches, but not too bad."
1,Unsafe,"It's a solid bench for the price, but the bolts may have a tendency of coming loose after ~2 months of use. The bench comes with a hexagonal wrench, so keep that in case the bolts do get loose.edit: Had a 5 star rating, but as of 11/27/12, i'm changing it to a 1 star. This piece of equipment is not safe to exercise on. The steel legs are very weak and keep getting wobbly. It's only a matter of time before it snaps on me. Avoid this."
5,Good deal,"This product is a simple item. It needs to be sturdy, it needs to be stable and it needs to be doing the job it was acquired for. It fulfills all these requirements."
5,multi functional,This bench is great...bottom line...It's versatility is everything you need forworking out at home. It's light weight but perform's heavy duty task's. I cannotsay enough about this flat bench...HIGHLY recommended for home use.
1,"Flimsy, massive structural crack when I was using it.","I'm 180 pounds and I was using two 35 pound dumbbells. A bit of angular momentum put some torque on the corner of the leg, and it snapped on me. I'm lucky not to have been hurt.Even if you're smaller than me, I would recommend avoiding this bench. Get a safe, solid bench."
1,This thing nearly killed me!!!!,"This awful bench buckled while I was benching 35lb weights, the front leg tore free from the bracket, slammed forward, then the rear leg bent inward - I dropped both weights, narrowly missing my face, and they hit the ground hard enough to cut my carpet!DO NOT BUY this thing is SHODDY and the metal is FAR too thin for any real use."
3,Good but respect to 300 lb. limit.,"After reading all of the great reviews about how sturdy and rugged it was I took a chance it would be OK for benching in the rack. No complaint with the manufacturer because they stated 300 lb. limit. Apparently non of the reviewers have a big bench press. The pad feels great. Ideal width and firm pad. But the frame will not take heavy weight. We had just done 625 for a 2 board press and were very lucky when I was about to take 675 out that one side spotter noticed the leg bent inwards about 10-15 degrees. Quite sure the 675 would have finished it and me off. Like I said, based on all the reviews I decided to 'check it out' and almost paid dearly. I'm going to get the legs welded at the seams so it's a solid bench and use it for DB work, so it's not a wast (price is great). I'd recommend it as a DB work bench. But if you and the bar weigh more than 300, don't risk it. Respect the recommended limit and it's a good comfortable and affordable light work bench."
2,Rebuilt,"more junk from china. I took it to work and retapped all the holes welded all the connecting metal parts, I added two gussets to the legs and bottom frame. I cut a one inch thick board and attached it to the factory board. Now its solid as a rock. I guess I could have made this in the shop LOL"
3,"Wobbly as crap, but cheap.","My title says it all.Wobbles like crazy, but it's cheap.It's hard to get your elbows below centerline using the bed, so this is good enough."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!,"Look, for any novice, this bench is plenty. It's flat and even, and fairly sturdy. But if you're a Muscle Head, get something else. The bolts come loose, and the padding is very uncomfortable as you get into your heavier sets. I think this bench will work very well for my 130lb wife, and her aerobic sets with no more than 15lb weights, but it's definitely not designed for a heavy man, doing heavy sets. But for $40, you'll be satisfied, just not impressed."
2,Not bad for the price,"For the inexpensive price of the bench its not bad. I'm using it for middle school student weight room and I don't think they will hold up. I ordered 3 benches, one box had already been opened and resealed. The fabric had a 3 inch slice in it so I will be sending it back. Two 6th grade students sat on it and the legs bent. Luckily it was the same ripped bench that I'm sending back but I can't wait to see how the others will hold up.I would be afraid to order this bench if I were a big guy. I'm also not happy that the company obviously took the bench back as a return and then just sealed it up and sent it off to me!!"
4,Good buy for the $$,"The bench was easy to assemble. You will need a wrench. I am 6""2"" 185lb and it works fine for me. Mine has a slight wobble, but it does not bother me (could just be my garage floor). It feels very sturdy, as in, it does not feel like it will collapse under me. For the price it is a nice basic, sturdy bench."
3,Great bench for the price.,"This is an excellent bench for the price. It is stable yet light, adding a variety of work-out options to my home gym. I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend this product.After less than two years of use the welds on the legs gave out and the bench is now pretty much useless. I'm removing two stars as I don't feel I received my money's worth of use out of it."
4,Great for the price!,"This bench was $47 when I ordered it. I looked at sports authority and they had a similar bemch for $99 - 25% off. This apex bench is built better than that unit in store, is cheaper, and was shipped to Hawaii for free! WHat more can you ask!The becnh itself is made of high quality steel and fits together plum and correct.-1 star because the bolts don't stay tight. Not a deal breaker, just beware that it requires minimal tightening and upkeep after months of use."
5,NOT BAD,"I took a chance buying this. And I wasnt disappointed. This is the cheapest bench I found looking in stores and online. I have no wobbling issue's. This is very sturdy. Assembling it was simple and took about 20 minutes,but you need to have your own wrench or socket wrench. This makes a nice bench too sit on. I was very happy with this purchase!"
2,When I opened the package the bench was torn.,I have called the manufacture several times and they said they would send a new bench top. Still no replacement. Take you chances.
1,Terrible product,The legs on this bench bend and are unsafe! Use at your own risk. A waste of money. I will now have to buy a new one from someone else.
1,Dangerous - skimpy steel tore,The bench was given to me as a Christmas present. One of the legs broke just before my third set. If I was holding any weight I could have been severely injured.This bench is not safe period.
4,Good value,I wanted a very low cost bench to use for 2 months at a vacation home. It met all my expectations
2,You get what you pay for.,"Lots of good reviews, great price, what could go wrong?Mine could not be assembled correctly. It had a manufacturing defect where the bolt holes in the vertical leg pieces were not aligned with the corresponding holes in the horizontal foot pieces so that I could not actually insert a bolt to attach the two pieces together. Well, it is made in China, but what isn't these days, right?From what I could put together, it seems like an adequate bench for moderate weight lifting. I'm not sure what the weight limit is, but it's probably enough for the average home fitness user. Maybe I just received a lemon since so many other reviewers were happy with their purchase. With that said, I think I'll pass on trying another one of the same and keep looking for a bench. Amazon has a great return policy for defective merchandise, so that shouldn't scare you away."
1,Please be cautious when using this bench,"Length:: 0:41 MinsJust to give you an idea, I'm about 170lbs and I work out with 24lbs maximum adjustable dumbbells. I had this bench for maybe 4 months or so, and my workouts usually last about 45 minutes using light weights (10-20lbs), so I do not think I put too much stress on the legs. This morning, one of the legs snapped off, and my neck is still hurting from the impact. I wish it had been the other leg that broke... So, please be careful. You might want to consider using this bench on a carpet, rather than on a hard floor."
1,"if you're a man, this bench isn't for you.","this bench can only support 310 pounds thus making it useless for ""real bench pressing"". I weigh 180 pounds, Whig means I van put 120 pounds safely on a bench to lift. USELESS. I basically wasted 40 dollars buying this cheap product. don't be fooled and don't skimp out on buying quality next time."
1,weak and wobbly,"Every time I try to bench press anything on this bench, I am taking my life in my hands. It violently wobbles and jerks under any significant weight."
5,Sturdy workout bench at a budget price.,"I'm quite surprised on how sturdy this flat bench is. For the price, you certainly getting more than what you paid for. Great bench for home gyms to do dumbbell presses, lying triceps extension, seated military presses and so on. I highly recommend this flat bench."
5,Good Bench Great Price,Pros: Ordered this bench to increase the range of exercises I can do from home with free weights. The padding is super comfortable and is similar to professional grade benched you would find in the gym. The metal base has a very 'heavy-duty' construction quality and will seemingly last forever.Cons: Due to its smaller size I cannot do a full ab workout on the bench the way I would like in fear of the bench tipping. However I keep finding workarounds and coming up with more uses during my workouts daily.All around a high quality product at a fantastic price. I would gladly by this product again.
4,"A basic, good / cheap bench.","This was a economical buy at around $60.I needed a small bench for my apartment, so I could attempt to continue at least portions of my normal workout routine.This bench is compact, light, sturdy, and fits nicely in the corner of my room.If your looking for basic, and sturdy, I would recommend this item."
5,A Short Review of the Wannsee Conference,"This book was a required read for my current history class. I found the book extremely interesting. It does not directly focus on the horrors of the holocaust, but instead gives a psychological and historical back ground of how and why this nightmare enfolded. This book can be very useful for all World War II historians as well as those studying the insights and warped reasons behind genocide. I can see this book being used for both European History and Sociology classes."
2,so so novel,"I read this book because the first three I could not put down after I picked them up. However, this book was somewhat of a dissapointment. It did not really start back up or explain things that happend in the previous book. It ended in a really strange place in the book. It could have most definatley been better written. I really hope there will be something to follow to make up for the dissapointment that this book left me with. I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the series. Was definatley the worst of the four books."
4,great value,"great value for the money - fits well except the sleeves are made for a long armed gorilla,too long to even push up. I'm cutting off about 9 ins, haven't worn it in the rain yet. Packs neatly into the front pocket, handy for travel.Happy with purchase."
4,good jacket for money,"be sure to order a larger size than you normally do. Good jacket for golf bag and walking dogs in cool, windy or rainy weather. One side toggle didn't work but the other side does, so was still able to cinch waist. You can pay much more and get better quality, fit and styling, but for a journeyman windbreaker, this is a great deal."
5,Nice item!,"Haven't worn it yet--too warm out. I am 5'2', weigh about 120. The small fits well, with sleeves being a bit too long, but they are elastic at the cuffs which makes that a non-problem. My son, who weighs more than I do, but is 4 inches taller, tried it on and it fits him fine. The material is as I thought it was described in other reviews--some body to it, but not too heavy. I know I will enjoy this jacket."
5,Perfect travel jacket,"I order from Amazon several times a month, and never leave reviews. Well, I felt compelled to review this jacket. First, the price is unbeatable. This jacket fits the bill on many levels. It fits my husband very well; it has a hood. Jacket hits the top of his thighs (he's 5'10), and folds up wonderfully into a nice little square. He was pleased to see there were belt loops, and also an outside loop so you can carry it on your wrist. And when the jacket folds up, there is an additional zippered section in which you can store, perhaps, a cell phone, money, and, potentially, keys. The maroon color is very rich and handsome. I've searched quite a while for foldable jackets, but at this price point, it is a steal - without sacrificing quality! You won't be sorry."
5,Pretty good anorak,"It is pretty good. 3XX sleves are a little too long for me, but not bothering too much. I am 6'2"" and the sleves are about 2-3"" longer than needed. Feels good, looks fine. Didn't try it in rain yet."
3,it's ok if you're not picky about fit,"I wanted a lightweight, rainproof jacket to take on trips, and I was having difficulty finding a reasonably priced jacket in the stores or on other sites. Being a plus-sized woman, I was a little worried about fit and size. I ordered the size I usually do when purchasing a uni-sex item such as this, but I guess manufacturers think that when you have multiple ""X's"" in front of the L, then your arms must grow exponentially. The sleeves were literally about 10 inches too long. Being on a time crunch for the trip and not really in the mood to shop any further, I just took the jacket to a tailor...at a cost of about 20 bucks. I guess that's what I get for not being able to try it on before buying. But, after the alteration, it's fine...it keeps me dry on those rainy days, but isn't hot and doesn't take up much space in my suitcase."
4,Anorak review,Fits well. Would like to have a collar in addition to the hood. Would like the hood to roll into its own pouch. Would like adjustable sleeve closures. I hope it is water proof.
5,Perfect weight,My husband and I both have this jacket and love them. We have decided it is the perfect weight for Las Vegas winters....very refreshing after living in the Midwest.
4,Like it,I like it but it does seem cheaply made lots of threads hanging. But again I didnot spend a lot of money on it so u get what u pay for
4,size down,"Good quality product, and just what I was looking to replace one I had form many years. Only complaint is that it runs large, wish I had sized down more than I did. I am keeping it, in fact have been using it camping, and performed great in windy and light rain. So all in all a good product."
5,Awesome and Inexpensive!,"I purchased this Anorak for my fiance as a late christmas present. I am always reluctant to purchase items over the internet without seeing and touching with my own eyes and hands. I was delighted when the package arrived on time and watch my fiance try on his new Anorak (which are hard to find these days!) It looked awesome. It is lightweight and the color was just as seen on the website. It is well made, durable and I am sure will be used for years to come. You can not beat this price and quality!"
3,The orange is WAY off from the picture!,"I ordered the orange and it shows SOOOO much differently on line. The orange I got was hunter orange. BRILLIANT orange, Bronco orange. Hardly the nice subtle color shown.The Texas Orange came in as shown. A really nice subtle color.Other than that, I love the jacket, and I KNOW about the colors as this last order put the total number I now have for gifts at 8.Some of my family lives in Portland OR which is a perfect place for this jacket. And, some other family loves to cruise, which is also perfect for those windy days.Yeah, I'm happy, just HATE that orange!"
5,My new fishing slipover jacket,"I'm 6'4"" and 300lbs, ordered a XXXL and it fits just the way I like it. Sliped over the t-shirt/sweater I was wearing with room to breathe. Quality of stitching and workmanship overall is quite good. Has a permanently attached hood that would do well to go over a baseball cap to keep it off your eyes. Stuffs backwards into the zippered front pocket fairly easily. Not lined, so don't expect it to keep you warm but it will contribute to warmth by acting as a wind barrier via layering effect. It will be a while before I have the chance to try the rainproofness. Very happy with the purchase."
2,"Inexpensive, lightweight -- serves my purpose","-- fit is large, not especially the length but in the arms and body. I purchased this to wear over layers -- it is lightweight and the price was great."
2,NOT A TRUE RAIN JACKET!!!!!!!! BEWARE,This is NOT a rain jacket. If you are outside for like 10 minutes and its raining really light than its fine. If you are expose longer to heavier rain then you'll be surprise! My cell phone got we even when I pocketed it in my jacket with this thing pulled over. Regret ever bought it.
1,I'll take a garbage bag over this any day!,"I didn't expect much from this, but I ordered it anyway. They said is water RESISTANT (not water proof), I can tell you it is not. The rain goes in through the seams which completely defeats the purpose of this jacket (unless you like to wear a colorful plastic bag because you think it's stylish). The Sleeves are way to baggy. The hood when laced covers your eyes so you can't see. And unless you get some other cheap windbreaker or rain pants you will be half soaked from the waist down (because the water will drip to your pants).About the only thing this jacket has going for it is that it stores well into a small little pouch. But otherwise it doesn't do what is advertised, keeping you dry. Buy a poncho or go with an umbrella......."
2,Not as described,"This item was described on the website as a unisex jacket. I ordered the jacket in a large which is the size I would order for a woman's jacket. I was disappointed to find the jacket was clearly designed for a man. It was much too large, with broad shoulders, a thick waist and narrowed at the bottom. The fabric and the color were fine, but because of the poor fit I returned the item to the seller."
4,Yea! A great smelling doggy shampoo!,This smells great on my long-haired chihuahua! I was so sad when Spa for Paws went out of business because I didn't think I'd ever find another shampoo that smelled as good on my doggy's long hair. This one is a very close second!
2,"""More Lullaby Renditions of the Beatles"" is better.","This is ok only because it is Beatle's music. The song selection isn't the greatest, not necessarily the Beatles tunes I would have selected to go on a lullaby album. ""I'm Only Sleeping"" might be about sleep, but in my opinion this arrangement of it is too dissonant and weird sounding for little ears - not very soothing. Also, these arrangements seem to be slightly flat (maybe just in a bad key?) and just kind of creepy sounding. I don't like the instrumentation either. If you want to get a Beatles lullaby CD I would much more so recommend the ""Rockabye Baby! More Lullaby Renditions of the Beatles"" instead. It is clearer and brighter sounding, and the songs are more kid-friendly than the ones on this album."
4,Rockabye Baby: Lullaby Renditions of The Beatles,"Nice CD for going to bed. My kids are 5 and 8. This is a bit cooler for them than the regular lullaby music for kids. It's not what I expected but I like it. It's a keyboard (I think) that's a bit plinky-plinky. It's just the melody of classic Beatles songs, no voice. In any case, my kids love it. We got the Bob Marley CD too. Both were a good purchase."
4,very soothing! Great shower gift,"I love this CD. My son would get relaxed hearing it when he was born. We used it up til he was about 6 months but that's mainly because we have forgotten about it. The songs sound really nice in the lullaby format. Still true to original but with a soft, pleasing sound that is great to soothe baby or help put baby to sleep."
4,love it!,Important to know that it's only instrumental. I love singing along with it to my son. Also nice to listen to at bedtime since he still sleeps in our room.
3,I love the Beatles but not this CD,"I really should have previewed the music before putting this on our baby registry. I don't think that option was there at the time though. First of all, I thought the songs would have words but it's just cheesy synthesized musical versions of famous Beatle songs. Why couldn't they have someone singing the lyrics on the tracks? I know all the songs by heart and it takes me a while to figure out what song each track is supposed to be because it hardly sounds like the actual Beatles music, which I recognize isn't as baby appropriate as ""lullaby music"". It's not too bad, but not too good either. Just not what I had in mind. I think I would rather just play the Beatles cds for my baby instead."
5,Baby Shower Gift,Both gift recipients LOVED this lullaby collection. The tunes were extremely recognizable.
4,Good for sleepy time,"We have the Rockabye Baby Led Zeppelin and the Beatles, and we love both of them. These are definitely lullaby versions; not something you'd want to listen to in the car, for instance. This Classic Rock Muzak.It doesn't really sound appealing, but it's actually quite relaxing to listen to on the way to sleep. And then you can listen to the real thing with baby during the day!"
1,elevator music,"We have the Radiohead and U2 versions of the Rockaby Baby CDs and love them. Instantly puts our toddler to sleep. This one, however, not only fails to put him to sleep but it also sounds like mediocre elevator music. Probably not the composer's fault. The Beatles have been so over-covered, anything but the original songs sound tacky."
1,Monotonous and nerve-wracking,"It was a good idea so poorly executed as to be jaw-dropping.When everyone has access to the Beatles transcription book, this guy wings it...using marimba, music box, and rhodes piano settings only, and poorly.Of course it puts baby to sleep...better to go into a deep sleep than dooze off listing to this music. It uses the same instruments, the same tempo, the same key thoughout.I am now dreading the arrival of my Led Zeppelin version."
2,OK but there is better- MyCradleTunes,"Rockabye is great but I don't love all the songs on the album. [...]. You can custom build CDs and there are more options- country, rock, pop- everything for baby!!!!!!! You can even request songs you would like added to the site. Awesome!"
3,The real thing would have been better,"I bought two of these Rockabye CDs - the other being Bob Marley. CD isn't bad but, the real songs from the Beatles would have been better. I wish someone would produce a Lullaby CD with actual songs by real artists."
4,Good overview,"Most books on science and religion are either anti-religion (wanting to throw out historic Christianity) or anti-science (wanting to throw out the evidence for evolution, the age of the earth and the universe, etc.).This one is neither, and that's what makes it a good book. McGrath has a virtue that is somewhat uncommon among conservative religious writers, and that is his profound respect for people and opinions with which he disagrees. Thus, he gives a fair presentation of ideas other than his own.I'm amused that another reviewer thought McGrath was too critical of fundamentalists. Other critics think McGrath *is* a fundamentalist!But to clear the air a little, McGrath uses the word ""fundamentalist"" to describe, not merely conservative doctrines, but a particular sociology that involves eagerness to be separate from everyone with whom one disagrees even slightly. McGrath is conservative but not, in that sense, fundamentalist."
2,dissapointing,I ordered the same size that i order in other brands but this one just didn't fit right. I just ended up looking frumpy.
1,Bad Smelling Jeans,"Whereas I really like Wrangler jeans, I haven't been able to wear this pair yet as I've been having to run them through the wash several times to try to get rid of the funky smell they arrived in. I haven't yet. They still smell some. Makes me wonder where these jeans were produced. I'm not likely to buy them again online as now I'd probably just return a pair that arrived smelling like these."
1,sizing,"Though the jeans are alright, the sizing is ridiculous. I am traditionally a size 6, but ordered size 4 according to the chart. I slipped them on, over my hips, without unbuttoning or unzipping them!"
1,NOT a training tool,"These collars and choke collars are inappropriate for dog training. In fact, many times dogs will end up head shy and anxious after wearing these. Purchase a Gentle Leader or Snoot Loop and have a veterinarian help you fit it correctly (many people use them improperly). Please don't buy into the dominance ways of Milan and such."
1,CRUEL!!!,"Please do not purchase this item! Can you imagine having to wear one of these? If you love your dog, I'm sure the thought just breaks your heart. Amazon: Why would you allow this to be sold??"
1,worthless computer players,"The computer players play entirely at random, including randomly folding top hands. Therefore, you can win every single game by pressing the raise button every single time, since this forces the computer to make the most decisions, giving them the most opportunities to fold a winning hand. This device will therefore not improve your poker game at all, and isn't any fun."
1,City of Angels revisited,"Pass this one by. Jon Anderson has put out some beautiful music but his brilliance is inconsistent. Some of his great cd's include 'Song of Seven', 'Animation', 'Three Ships', and 'Change we Must'. This disc is an attempt at R&B and has that slick, overproduced LA sound like In the City of Angels. Now if you liked that one, then give this one a try, but if you thought that was a weak effort by this living legend then save your money."
2,Yuck,"I like a couple of these songs....""Magic Love"", ""Heaven's Love""....but there's so much [junk] here! Jon brought in a producer, some guy that I nor anybody on the planet has ever heard of, to make this album. There's a lot of the drum machines, samples and whatnot; however, it's so tastelessly done, it's a very generic attempt at sounding 'modern'. The other reviewers were comparing this one to ""City of Angels"", perhaps in how it was done (bringing in musicians/producers for a more contemporary sound than what Jon is perhaps know for)....yet that album is much much better than this one. What a dud....stay away from this album. I only give it 2 stars because the lyrics themselves have a very positive message that music of today really needs."
3,Jon Anderson - 'The More You Know' (Cleopatra),"I wasn't at all aware that Yes frontman - Jon Anderson had so many solo releases out. Tunes here I liked the most were ""Magic Love"", ""Maybe"", the title track ""The More You Know"", the somewhat catchy ""Take, Take, Take"", the emotional ""Sad"" and ""Some TV"". Line-up: Jon Anderson & Jane Luttenberger Anderson - vocals, Jeff Kellner - guitar and Bobby Jocky - bass & keyboards. Overall, nothing to get all stoked about - but an okay progressive 'vocal rock' effort."
2,what the???,"I'm a big Anderson/Yes fan and loved Desseo along with most of his solo work, but The More You Know lacks inspiration. The three or four good songs aren't worth the price of the CD"
4,Jon: Why?,"Why'd ya do it Jon? Why did you copy I.T.C.O.A.? Thats just wrong. But hey, the album is still good."
5,love our new Delta faucet,"We saw the Delta victorian double-handle kitchen faucet in rubbed bronze at friends home and wanted it for our remodeled kitchen. Looked at the big box stores with special order only or even through Delta it was over $600. Ouch! We were able to get it for less than half of that through Amazon....wow. It came in the original box, in new condition. Thanks!"
5,Its a kids salsa Orquestra Please...,I m a litle disapointed that people that know about Salsa music dont back up this school of future musicians.This kids just get better and better I had the opportunity towatch them perform and there salsa is a sound very much of there own (they sound like the tradiccional puertorican bands)
2,"Uh, I don't think so...","This is a high 1 or a low 2 as I feel it may appeal to SOMEONE else moreso than it did to me. I'm sorry to say but despite a fair number of *names* included on this disc, and some minorly interesting artwork obviously mixing the Goth world with that of the Ewan McGreggor movie, I only found a track or two (Chandeen...maybe! and Rosetta Stone) that bore repeated listening. As it sits in the back of my collection, this CD is quite skippable in favor of the more popular (perhaps justifiably so) yet slightly more expensive ""Goth Box"" or ""Black Bible""."
2,Handbook of Pediatric & Neonatal Transport Medicine,"The handbook jumps around quite a bit. The pediatric sections are out of date. There are some areas of the book whick are helpful but overall, I feel there are better alternatives on the market."
1,Denise,"I have not received my order as of yet. I keep emailing Beauty Rose and telling them and I am not receiving any response back from them . I had received an order by mail, it was not what I ordered and it was to a lady in FL, I am in MD. So I, with my own money, forwarded it to the lady and the address on the packing slip. I emailed Beauty Rose and they replied a thank you. I told them that they could credit my order in what I paid for shipping for them. They replied that I had no order with them. I am assuming what happened was they sent my order to the wrong person since I received an order that was to someone else. When the other person received my order, maybe they just kept it instead of returing it or forwarding it. I have emailed Beauty Rose 3 times asking them about my order and they have not responded once. They have taken my money. This company has been very disappointing and right now it looks like they are going to steal my money instead of providing me with what I purchased."
1,Really Bad,"This book is one of the reasons I dislike trilogies. I read the first two books which represented very good, inventive science fiction. When the third book (which I looked forward to reading) turns out to be wretched, I felt cheated.Hybrids is chiefly a treatise on the wonders of Canadian socialism, and a blunt object to beat on Americans, Christians, and white males. This constant antagonism squelches what little interest there is in Sawyer's overly clever plot, and makes his characters difficult, if not impossible to connect with."
2,Disappointing,"Very disappointing - I waited a long time for all three of these to be in paperback so I could read them all together. They weren't anywhere close to as good as the rest of his work and I'm a big Robert Sawyer fan as well as a feminist. Mary, the primary female character, was not a very sympathetic person although I'm sure she was meant to be. Lots of potential that just never quite got there."
1,Really terrible,"The first book in this series really grabbed me, the second was OK, but oh, does the final book stink. You can see it from other reviews, but seriously the main idea of this book is that there are two terrible evils in our world: 1) Religion (especially Christianity) and 2) White, male men - no make that White, male, American men (Canadians men are apparently a little better.) The book is frankly downright silly; just about every liberal / politically correct idea in the world is addressed: Male voilence against women, homosexuality, bisexuality, tons of environmental issues, socialism, and on and on...I can understand making a social commentary, but this is one of the most cliche pieces of liberal dribble I have ever read."
1,really bad,The first book was interesting but the series failed to maintain a good science fiction line. The romance between a human and Neandertal wasn't believable and got to be boring.
1,Promising series ruined by politics!,"The first book was great! A nifty sci-fi premise. The second book was slow and filled with heavy handed gender politics.Hybrids just plain ruined the series. I forced myself through to the end just to see if it redeems itself. It does not. I won't waste time listing the ridiculous politics of this book. Politics in sci-fi is great if it is subtle and contributes to the story. Sawyer just used a decent sci-fi story to beat us crudely over the head with his opinions of men, Caucasians, and Americans.Rather than explore the interactions between two worlds, this novel contrasts a utopia with our flawed, failing world just to show us all how awful we are. The villains have almost no motivation besides being White American Men!Enjoy the first book. Skip the last 2!"
1,How bad was this book?,"As the main characters in the book would say, ""Christ what a dog"". I've read all three of the trilogy. The first book was marvelous a great concept. But it has been downhill all the way. As a French-Canadian I can relate to the Canada references but the anti-americanisms in volume 3 start to smell up my nose (even though it's a sapiens nose and not a neaderthal nose). It gets trite, pedantic, overly PC and heavy handed. You Canadians don't carry guns says the evil american as he whips out his semi-automatic. Give me a break.The female Sapiens character in love with the male Neaderthal is such a whinny character. I'm in love, now I want my male to do this and that and change some more. Oh, and why don't you just move to my universe and give up yours. The best part was that the male Neanderthal wasn't going to give in to her whinning.I could go on and on but then I'd just be getting as boring as this book was. To some it all up MERDE"
4,Finishing the trilogy,"This is the third book in Sawyer's Neanderthal Parallax trilogy. In this book Ponter Boddit and his homo sapien lover, geneticist Mary Vaughan are trying to sort out how they can make their relationship work between their parallel worlds. With some of the Neanderthal technology they are planning to conceive the first hybrid child. Hybrid provides a satisfying conclusion to the tale. It also provides much for thought regarding gender, selective breeding, looking through jaded eyes at an unspoiled world"
3,Lease favorite of the trilogy,"The first and second book were marvelously entertaining and fun. The third one is unfortunately not as captivating as the others. I believe the author was unsure how to proceed with the storyline -- he had many choices, but somehow decide to take a less provocative option. Too many predicable events and far too few surprises or twists, and the ending was a disappointment ... perhaps this wasn't not the ending?"
3,Good summer fare,"Alittle thin on the story line. Events like those written about, an exchange of a neandethal with another universe, would not be contained in a backwoods Canadian village,"
3,the best of the series,master and commander is the best in the series. the books that follow gradually transform the saga into a string of thinly-disguised romance novels -- most of which i was unable to finish.
5,Great novel as always!,O'Brien has written yet another masterpiece of maritime historical fiction! He can't write fast enough for the readers in our family. We have not read anything so good since Heart of Allegiance by the Thoene brothers. This is nose to nose in the running with the Portraits of Destiny Series! Keep 'em coming Patrick!
5,Best sea tale I've read thus far,"Master & Commander is the opening book in a 21 book Aubrey/Maturin series. This book's purpose is to introduce the reader, and thus does not have a plot per se, but is really vignettes. O'Brian uses dialog true to the period, so it's a bit of an awkward read for newbies like me, but absorbing and captivating all the same. I seriously enjoyed the book and intend to continue with the series. Can't put it much better than that. Definitely a worthwhile read if you're into historical fiction or sea tales. 5 stars!"
3,Too slow for me,"The book moves slowly like a sailing ship in a light breeze, but if you love the old Royal Navy and all the fine details about old fighting ships, this is a five star book for you. The author really knows his stuff."
3,"Not Masterful, Yet","The first in the Aubrey-Matruin series displays all of O'Brian's erudition, with only some of the verve and narrative mastery of the books that came shortly thereafter. Essentially a series of cruises through the Mediterranean, the novel lacks the strong narrative arc that many of the other novels posses and it suffers for the lack.Nevertheless, Master and Commander remains a fascinating and compelling story of life at sea during the Napoleonic wars. Captain Jack Aubrey and Surgeon Steven Maturin are here revealed, for the first time, in all their complexity and humanity.If you find yourself getting slowed down by this book, muddle through. The rewards will be great when you dive into the next several books, beginning with number two, Post Captain."
2,Not an original plot,"The plot of this novel is taken from the autobiography of Admiral Lord Cochrane, first published in 1860. The events included describe Cochrane's activities when he commanded the Speedy from 1800-1801 (see ""the Autobiography of a Seaman,"" by Admiral Lord Cochrane, republished in 2000 by Lyons Press). O'Brien has replaced Cochrane with the fictional James Aubrey, giving him a similar personality. While O'Brien has given more color to the story, there is absolutely nothing significant that is original to the plot. I have to agree with a recent reviewer that the novel describes a lot of action without having a central plot. The second book in the series, ""Post Captain,"" seems to be a more original story, but many of O'Brien's novels seem to have taken significant amounts of material from earlier writers (without acknowledging that fact)."
2,I just couldn't keep reading,"I've never read a book where the author tried so hard to keep all the dialog and terms true to period. I rarely understood what was going on; it was English, but from times past (the King James Bible is easier reading). That, plus all the nautical jargon that is never explained, kept me from any enjoyment the book may have had to offer. I gave up after a third of the book."
3,Copied from Horatio Hornblower,"This book has a very similar story line from the Horatio Hornblower's series (I think it was the book ""Hornblower and the Hotspur"")I have read all of the C.S. Forester books and when I purchased this book I could not believe how similar the story line is. Instead of Lt Bush you have LT Dillion, Hornblower and Aubry have the same qualities and the both meet the good DR. the same way. I will check out the next book as see if I experience deja vu"
1,A Chore to Read,"Contrary to many of the reviews listed here (which influenced me to buy this book), I found it very tedious and difficult to read. It is so engrossed in the old English and ship terms that it's only value for me was as an academic exercise. Entertainment value: 1 out of 5, Technical Sailing terms: 5 out of 5, Readability: 1 out of 5. Recommendation: Select something more enjoyable to read."
2,Makes Lord of the Rings look fast-paced,"I have the unabridged audio edition of Master and Commander. Three hours into the audio version, NOTHING has happened. No conflict. No plot. There is a lot of nattering on about ship budgets, hiring crew members, and the finer points of music and dining in 17th century Mallorca. But in all that time, the ship hasn't even left the dock.I gave up expecting anything to happen. I might have kept reading if the characters were remotely interesting--after all, I enjoyed Lord of the Rings, I love Stephen King and Tad Williams--but these characters are as dull and dry as their powdered wigs."
2,All at sea...,"With all the hype I expected better. I have to agree with other reviewers that the sea jargon weighs down the writing, and the plot and characterization could have been better. I admired the author's knowledge of 18th century seafaring, but on the whole I was left dissapointed."
5,The best historical adventure series I've read,"I'm still looking for a book or series of historical adventures that offers even half the entertainment value of this series. O'brien is a contemporary writer who seems to have lived in the 18th century, and he makes his knowledge entertainingly accessable to the reader. The sailing and combat scenes move fast and are gripping. The Aubrey-Maturin relationship is one of the most convincing friendships in literature. The male-female subplots can be boring. If you don't like Master and Commander you probably wouldn't like any other book in the series. Master and Commander is slow starting -- give it 50 pages and see...."
4,Unfocused but fun read for Hornblower fans,"Newly promoted commander and given the Sophie, Jack Aubrey is thrilled to recruit a real physician, Stephen Maturin, as ship's surgeon. Their friendship deepens as the Sophie takes prizes and faces battle.Solid sea-yarn in the Hornblower mold, although O'Brian splits Hornblower's active and ruminative sides between different characters, and does a surprisingly good job following two main characters. The only real flaw is that the plot never achieves a focus, wandering between sea adventures, Stephen's political history, and Jack's love life."
2,Not My Cup of Tea,"I bought this book as part of a Guy's Book Club. Other Guy's in the book club had read this book and really liked it. Obviously, this whole series has a huge following and, of course, there's the Russell Crowe movie.For me, though, I couldn't get past all the dialect and authenticity. I couldn't get into the flow of the narrative and I only just barely followed the plot line. So after about 100 pages, I put it down. People who like this type of book will love it but if you're thinking of reading it because all your friends loved it and the movie was cool, you might be in for more than you bargained for."
5,A Pleasant Surprise!,"When you start reading the first book in any series of novels, you always have to make a decision at some point as to whether or not you will continue to read the next book(s). For me, the decision to continue with the series came very early, probably in the first 50 pages. O'Brian paints a wonderful picture of Captain Aubrey, a very interesting and colorful commander, his new friend and ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin, and the rest of the crew of the Sophie. Let me say that going into the book, I had very little knowledge of the Napoleonic era, ships, or the sea. I really didn't think that I would enjoy the book, but I was wrong. I was fascinated with every aspect of the book. The characters, the atmosphere, the action...all of the book is first-rate. I'm glad I've got 19 more books in the series left to enjoy, but I'm afraid the pages will turn all too quickly."
4,Ultimately mesmerizing,"I had tried to read one of the Aubrey/Maturin books some years ago (because of my interest in the period and the lure of the Jane Austen claims) but couldn't get through it. I returned to Master and Commander and persevered, and have now gobbled up all 20 of the novels. I think they are wonderful (and far more complex than the Hornblower books, which I like, but which become rather rote psychologically)--but you do have to become accustomed to O'Brian's fluky rhythm and the almost berserk naval terminology. (I sometimes suspected that O'Brian was making up particularly convoluted naval terms and laughing at us.) You might ask, why persist? Because the novels create an imagined world, intensely interesting and vividly described. They also become completely gripping in terms of plot--O'Brian frequently leaves an important question dangling at the end of one novel, forcing you to get to the next as quickly as possible."
4,Opening chapter to what may be the best epic ever.,"The only reason I don't give this book four stars is that it takes about 100 pages to get into, quite a bit for a 400-odd page book, until you consider that it is really a ~6500 page epic divided into 20 chapters. This epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago. A note of caution, though: if you get through those first hundred pages, you may not be able to put these works down until you've read all twenty volumes."
3,Great movie!,"I bought this book for my husband who loved the movie ""Master and Commander"" and is hooked on Horatio Hornblower books. He reports it is not quite as good as the Hornblower books but he is intrigued by the era and the genre."
1,Why not in eBook?,This is one of the finest sea stories ever written with meticulous detail to character but I cannot purchase the eBook for my Kindle only the audio version. If you happen to like audio books I strongly recommend this.
1,Defeated,"I always prided myself in finishing every book that I started no matter how bad. Patrick O'Brian managed to give me an Ol' Broadside. I just couldn't finish it. I tried but I realised I was wasting too much of a short life. I was hoping that these books would be like a ""Sharpe at Sea"" type series. Alas it was not to be and reading this left me in the ""Doldrums""."
1,What is all the fuss about? VERY overrated.,What a boring book!! Having to read the other 16 or whatever books in the series would be like a punishment. Only reason I read this was that it was selected by our book club. Aubrey and Maturin are not very profound or complex characters. I was not impressed with O'brian evolution of characters - the arcane language gave the story a gloss but no substance. This is like the Hardy Boys series for adults.
1,"not really a novel, a scholarly report, more like","Mr o'brian is a formidable scholar, but he is no novelist. I read 120 pages of this and gave up. No dramatic tension, no plot, no character development. For sailing fanatics only."
4,"Great book, would have made a better movie than the one out.","This book would have made a great movie on its own. They borrowed the titles from two books. They should have stuck with the series verbatem.The book kept my interest. Even with the very technical descriptions of the sailing terms it was hard to stop listening. The heavy verbose english takes about 1 disk to get used to, but once you do, you will sink right into it.Highly recommended for sailors or historians."
4,master and commander,I had seen the movie but not read the book. It was very good. Well written and suspenseful.I plan on purchasing more of the series. I have become a Patrick O Brian fan.
5,A Great Story,"The master and commander series is incredible. I very much enjoyed the Master and Commander story. It was the first time in a long while that I did not try to avoid reading this book. It was very long but I was glued to this exciting story. This book is great if you want to read a factual and realistic action adventure story. I am really looking forward to reading the rest of the series. I think everyone should sit back and enjoy the wonderfully composed Master and Commander series,"
2,A (very) distant second to Horatio Hornblower....,"The naval descriptions are so voluminous and exact that I suspect the author was showing off how detailed his research was, rather than using it to forward the plot or develop the characters (which, heaven knows, need a lot of development).I am prone to like heroes, especially of the British variety, but this was a disappointment. I'm going back to re-reading H.H. for the hundredth time, and I recommend you all do the same."
5,Good series!,"I have now finished reading all twenty volumes in this series. I thought it was great. Well-written, seemingly excellent treatment of history and natural history. Nice treatment of characterization along with plenty of action."
4,A rollicking adventure at sea,"This first book in the series featuring Captain Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin is a thrilling and fast-paced adventure set in the early 1800s. Aubrey is given his first command, a slow brig called ""Sophie"" which is unlikely to help him advance in the British navy. With the help of his friend Maturin and the crew of the ""Sophie"", Aubrey engages in one battle after another, slowly gaining a reputation and the wrath of the French and Spanish fleets. Now if Aubrey's luck can only hold out as he and his crew are hunted by the best in the Spanish fleet. ""Master and Commander"" vividly displays life at sea: the food and weather, the floggings for drunkenness, the severe punishments for sodomy, the great excitement of battle. I fully expected to be daunted by the technical aspects of navy ships, but Patrick O'Brian's masterful storytelling kept me wrapped in the jaunty tale to the end. I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this novel because it's so unlike what I usually read."
3,The edition,"No need to review the book, I have read them all but had missed the first one. Note that the cover pictured is the original, first Norton edition but what you receive is the later edition. Not the collector's edition."
4,Interesting contrast to the Hornblower series,"I am most of the way through the Horatio Hornblower series and thought I would take a look at this series since they take place in the exact same timeframe and the hero has almost the same roles. This is just the first book, but I am favorably impressed. I still really like the Hornblower series, but there are enough differences in the main characters that I am intrigued enough to continue with this string of novels.I am enjoying getting to know a lot more about the warships of the early 19th century and though I don't know much about sailing, my engineering mind tells me that the problems and solutions in the novels are realistic.I recommend this book to anyone interested in historical fiction from this period or for those interested in action and adventure in general."
5,Adventure in the Med,"This book was close to my heart, being a sailor myself and a bit of a history buff. The language was a mite flowery at times, but, English at the dawning of the 19th century WAS flowery. It did nothing to distract from the story, which was a lively yarn. The book was historically accurate as far as I could tell, and one of the few stories that mentioned an elm-tree pump. A pretty much unheard of piece of equipment.I reckon I'll have to read the whole series now, as this one was thoroughly enjoyable."
2,Couldn't finish it,"I tried to listen to this book as an audiobook and it just failed to hold my interest. I made it about halfway through, but there wasn't enough conflict or tension in the plot, and I didn't particularly like any of the characters. I suppose if you're into the history or the nautical terminology, then it does a good job in those respects. It just wasn't for me."
2,A difficult read and not related to nautical terms,"I had recently read every Horatio Hornblower book and was quite excited to tackle all the Master and Commander books. However, I found Master and Commander to be far less accessible and enjoyable to read. First, I am up on all my nautical terms. Second, I have an advanced degree and am more than used to reading complicated subject matter. Though I appreciate the more gritty realistic edge to Master, I think it falls far short of Hornblower based purely and solely on writing alone.In Master and Commander the dialog is just plain weird, NOT in terms of the terminology, but in the constant shifting of topics of discussion between the characters. In a similar way scenes also shift without warning and it all adds up to a very confusing and less than satisfying read. If you really want a sea tale and to be taken away to live in the world of the Royal British Navy, go read Hornblower and/or see the DVDs for both Hornblower and Master and Commander!"
4,Mastery,"This is a great, readable novel sent on a wartime sailing vessel during the Napoleonic Wars. I have a love affair with this time period, and the sailing ships thereof, and this novel brought home the goods in both respects, conveying the realism of close quarters on a ship of war. In this case, I also learned something: how warships of that era managed their financing, so far from home. I may continue to explore the books in this series, from time to time."
4,If you like books about the sea -- a must read,"Love this book. Gets overly detailed with antique sailing lingo which may bore some readers, but if you can deal with that then great characters and adventures."
2,Bring a dictionary...,"I disliked this so much, I had to review it. The use of period vocabulary and nautical terms had me running for a dictionary or the web more times than I considered reasonable. Had to give up before the ""sophie"" even set sail."
3,Tough to read for adult; impossible for younger kids,"Having read An Eye of the Fleet and Mr Midshipman Hornblower, I was looking forward to the start of the O'Brian series. I started to read this book and struggled to get through the 1st 3-4 chapters. The 1st reason for my problem was that the nautical terms and discriptions of the ship were very difficult. There is no list of terms in this book which would be very helpful. My second problem with the beginning of this book was there is no action until you get to around chapter 5. I almost gave up finishing the book during the 1st 3-4 chapters about 4 to 5 times. After getting through this tough time, the story starts to improve and is pretty good. I found this book tough to read. I would not recommend this book to younger kids. For younger readers (and older ones too), I would sugest Mr Midshipman Hornblower or An Eye of the Fleet. I do not plan to continue this series any time soon."
2,Too hard to follow,"Unless you're a sailor or a mariner this book was too hard to follow. Plus the fact that the author uses a lot of old English language and terminology. At times, I found myself re-reading paragraphs and looking up words to find their meaning. I still haven't seen the movie. I hope that it's easier to understand."
3,"Good Story, but can be very technical to read","Well written, but I often got lost in the technicalities e.g you often need to refer top the ship layout diagram in the front cover"
4,First of Many,"One begins Master and Commander with some trepidation -- it being the first chapter of an intensely beloved twenty volume series. Fortunately, the opening scenes depicting the first meeting of O'Brians's long running protagonists are funny and engaging. It is only thereafter that the book becomes a challenging read.There is a little in the way of an overarching narrative; Master and Commander serves as more of an introduction to life on a Napoleonic brig, and to Aubrey and Maturin. But the book's real difficulty lies in its absolute immersion in its era. It makes no concession to a modern reader lacking knowledge of the period, the setting, or how to rig a frigate. This makes the book a sometimes tough read -- but is also why it is ultimately so rewarding.One close's Master and Commander with the sense of having spent time with very particular people in a very particular time, looking forward to doing so again in the next volume."
3,Rough Seas,"I found this book interesting but difficult to read. The narrative is choppy, jumping from place to place, and Mr. O'Brian ends scenes abruptly. It takes quite awhile to get a feel for the characters. The nautical terms made some passages almost unreadable for me. Over all I enjoyed it but would not recommend it for the casual reader."
4,Great,"While the cost of the cd was outragious, I did not have any other option. I think this is why the price is so high. I have seen it as high as $50 so I was grateful to only pay $25.It is a hilarious cd and my entire family loves it.Thank you"
4,Great Price,"I purchased these for my 13 year old son, who lives and breathes soccer. We looked all around and Amazon offered the best price on this shoe. He has had them for several months and they are very comfortable and are holding up very well."
2,Disappointing and unnecessary,"Merrill published his autobiography, Once More from the Beginning, in 1965, with a different ghostwriter. When I picked up this book, I wondered why he had switched ghostwriters. After reading it, I wondered no longer. Approximately the first half of this disappointing, rather trashy book is simply an inferior recycling of the same autobiographical material in Once More from the Beginning. The remainder is a grab-bag of anecdotes, vignettes, smutty stories, all written in a breathlessly breezy, glib, gossipy, frivolous style that is long on tawdry titillation and short on class, taste, and substance--and sometimes believability as well. Anyone interested in Merrill's life and career should read Once More from the Beginning; it's no masterpiece but it's a lot better than this redundant, unnecessary dud."
4,a good introduction to a fascinating part of American history,"I suspect that most Americans are like me: they know much more about the Revolutionary War and the Civil War than they know about the War of 1812. Borneman's book gave me a solid foundation of understanding. It is engaging and fun to read and, in my view, proves its main thesis that the War of 1812 played a major role in shaping and transforming the young nation into one with a genuine national consciousness."
5,"Finally, an A in History.","Why can't history text books be this well written? If they were, I and most of my fellow citizens might not be so pathetically ignorant about our American heritage! 1812, The War That Forged A Nation by Walter R. Borneman is an historical account that weaves in the passion and intrigue of our forefathers to create a tapestry of human drama. With the detail of an historical researcher and the skill of a story-teller, the author presents the reader with a living, breathing understanding of this event. An enjoyable and informative read, that I highly recommend."
3,Very little new information,"If you have a casual interest in American history or know very little about the War of 1812 this might be a good read. This book is brief and uncomplicated, but its scholarly merits are practically zero. Borneman used basically no primary source material. There is no real original analysis of the war. I did not really care for his writing style, which seemed overly familiar and conversational.Not terrible by any means, but only of casual interest"
2,Superficial,The information in this recording only scratched the surface of the war -- the only details it provided were about the lead-in to the war. I had hoped to learn more about the actual war and was very disappointed.
3,A few flaws,"this book is a great addition to the scant literature on oen of americas most overlooked and fascinating wars, the war of 1812. Many important figures were involved incldued Admiral Perry and General scott and Andy jackson, as well as the important politicians of the day, madison, Monroe, Clay and the rest. It was an important conflict in cementing american power and every american should read it, but with one reservation, the writing style is amatuer at best, and becomes hard to get through for someone used to excellent history writing. To be sure this is interesting writing and not dry history, but it leaves something to be desired. THis book is recommended, but perhaps for amatuers, or those interested in popular history, or those not easily annoyed by writing style.Seth J. Frantzman"
3,Informative and pretty detailed,I am a casual history buff. This book was pretty well written and got all of the major points across which is what I was looking for. It dove a little too deep in a couple of sections for my liking.
4,A good popular account of a neglected war,"Previous reviewers are dead-on: the War of 1812 hasn't gotten its due. With the exception of Francis Scott Key, the burning of Washington and the Battle of New Orleans (inaccurately described as meaningless because it occurred after the peace treaty was signed), few Americans have come to fully appreciate the War of 1812.Walter Borneman has written a highly readable, entertaining book on this conflict, placing it in the context of early American history and not losing any narrative ""oomph."" Historians may take exception with his style, but then again history isn't just for the professors. As a professor, I am not 100% sure I would assign this in a class. Despite my praise, Borneman's main thesis that the War of 1812 ""forged a nation"" is a bit oversold, lacking in uncontroverted evidence. Nevertheless, it's hard to argue with something that gets people talking, so I commend this book to others."
2,"A superficial book, not worth buying unless you are well-versed in American history","Have you ever been in a conversation where somebody starts telling a complicated story from the middle and you have no idea what they are talking about? Borneman's War of 1812 reads like that kind of conversation. I was looking for a discussion, a description and explanation of the American view on the War of 1812. As a Canadian with no background in American history, I found this book too `inside baseball' to follow. The author showed an unfortunate tendency to take a `patriotic' view of American history when a more even-handed and objective approach might have served better. All in all, a superficial book, not worth buying unless you are well-versed in American history and think the Americans actually won the War of 1812."
5,A great read,"The impact the War of 1812 had on American history is often overlooked by many people. Walt Borneman not only brings to life this very important time period, but he does it in a manner that the reader immediately becomes engrossed into the story. It is obvious by his remarkable attention to detail that Borneman's research is impeccable and that he has a true passion for both history and writing. I would recommend this book for both history buffs and for those people like me who just want to expand their basic knowledge of American history."
3,"Okay Read, Poor Writing","I know that everyone else seems to really enjoy this book, and in general it is okay. I do have to say, however, that the conversational style of this book was distracting. One usually doesnt find question marks at the ends of sentences in the history genre. It wasn't terrible, but many times I found myself saying, ""Wow, that was a poorly worded sentence that doesnt fit well with this genre.""Just my 2 cents."
3,it was OK,"If you would like a quick skim through the war of 1812 that hits the important points, discusses the major participants and has a few exciting battle descriptions then you would enjoy this book."
2,Not about forging America at all,"I am at a predisposition against military histories, so this was not as exciting for me. I bought it expecting some of this for sure, but the title promises a political and cultural slant that was almost completely absent. For what it was, it was pretty good and very detailed, but this was not about forging America at all."
1,The conversational style robs the narrative of all credibility,"First, an admission: I only read the first chapter.That's as far as I could get.I regard myself as an extremely avid and knowledgeable US history aficionado, and am used to reading books that are written *much* better. Ambrose, McCullough, Ellis, Fischer, McPherson. These are authors who know how to write a historical narrative. Borneman writes with a stilted style that gives the impression of your war veteran uncle telling you the story. Phrases like ""Enough said"", ""greased his palm"", ""Perhaps.... (twice in the first chapter) abound. The aforementioned sentence ending with a question mark and topped off with an inordinate amount of personal musing, theorizing and essentially completely guessing make this book intolerable. I find it really hard to believe that this many people find this an acceptable account of US history, especially my once-revered Remini.Aargh."
2,What Forged a Nation,"I had read a book about the French and Indian war, one about the revolution and also the recent best seller,1776. I found The War That Forged a Nation an excellant addition to my understanding of this important period in American history. I would highly recommend it. Very readable."
4,Great for what it is,"This is a great piece of historical war story telling. It has a solid narrative, the pageantry of the battles and easy-to-ready style. It's not the best analysis of the causes of the war or the consequences of the tactics, and it's been surpassed by other works that go into more details about the politics and culture--there are better choices other there. But Borneman is a great story teller and he does an admirable job here. Anyone who has never read anything on the War of 1812 would do well to start here."
2,Disappointing,"Generally, I found the book a bit boring to read. The chapters jump back in forth in terms of time, which makes the book (and the War of 1812) difficult to follow. I feel that the author gets burdened down on details that are not needed, and in the end makes the book less readable. All I can say is that while parts of the book were interesting, most of the time I found my mind wandering and had to try really hard to stay focused. Unfortunately, because I didn't get much out of this book I will need to find another, better book about the War of 1812."
5,Very Nice Retelling of Russian Folk Tale,"I'm a big fan of Rafe Martin and this is one of my favorite books he's written. The tale is somewhat like Cinderella without the prince. A mean aunt and cousin plot to do away with an orphan by making her do impossible tasks. The twelve months assist her in doing the impossible which enrages her relatives. This is a good book to do in the fall. It teaches the 12 months, seasons, apples and harvest time. I enjoy this book very much."
2,DISAPPOINTING!!!,"Yes, some of this is funny, but I found it very difficult to hear. Like the other review states, the sound is not very good, as the sound was picked up from the speakers in the theater. I found myself trying too hard to actually hear what he saying and missed a lot of the material. I have friends from England and can understand most of the performance, but my father, being frustrated, left the room, not being accustomed to the accent. Dress to Kill is DEFINITELY the best one."
5,LOVE EDDIE!!!,"GREAT comedian!!! Love all of his stand up shows, own almost all his DVD's seen him live in Miami!! GREAT SHOW!!! This DVD is a must have!"
4,"""Earwhigs Make Chutney""- Solid, Vintage Izzard","Those familiar with Eddie Izzard's relaxed, stream-of-consciousness style will find this performance enjoyable. Newcomers will take a few moments to adjust to it though, as Izzard's English material (a line about Devon gets a big laugh) and transvestitism may throw them a bit.This is a 1994 show, and even then, Izzard's ""Star Trek"" material must have been dated. But the man is so affable, by the time he's talking about different settings for phasers, you're chuckling in spite of yourself. Other bits are even more far-fetched: If bees make honey, why don't earwhigs make chutney? Good stuff.HOT TIP: Izzard has a tendency to mumble, and some of his best lines are barely audible asides, so turn the subtitles ""on."""
5,Love Eddie!,I had bought DTK & Glorious previously and became an Eddie fanatic and bought this one too. As previous reviews have stated though not to the high standards of DTK & Glorious still well worth the purchase. If you are feeling down put on Eddie and I guarrantee you'll feel better.
1,Not very useful.....,"I enjoyed ""Metabolism at a glance"" immensely. So, I purchased this thinking it'd help me as well. This is a very poor book. For an example, for the complement system the index states that page 7 has information on this topic. However, page 7 is titled ""How to use this book"". Of the 4 times I've tried to use the index I was directed to a page that had nothing to do with what I was looking for. Each topic is devoted 2 pages, left and right of the open book form. The right page simply has definitions related to the topic. Left page has an illustration for the topic. But, I have yet to find clear explanation for any of the topic I wanted to learn. The cartoon illustrations are a bit too complicated and this confusion is compounded by the text saying things like ""note the central role of such and such.....in the illustration"" when the illustration is a bit too complex with too many arrows. I'd not buy this book."
5,Makes it seem easy,"Calculus is not an easy subject (no duh), but the incremental style that this textbook uses made it easier for me to learn and understand. Problems that were learned in previous lessons are kept fresh in the student's mind as new concepts are slowly introduced.I was homeschooled and have studied math using Saxon nearly all my life. Now I'm not only a continuing student, but, thanks to Saxon, I now tutor teens in public high-schools too."
3,Not a practical book for building XML security.,"I bought this out of curiosity especially to build XML element level security using SAML, XKMS and XACML.- This book just reproduced the SAML, XKMS and XACML specs and examples and it does'nt discuss real world implementation scenarios. Which is quite disappointing !- No discussion on how to create Interoperable Web services security involving Microsoft .NET and J2EE Web services.- No discussion on implementing Liberty Alliance and Passport."
4,A Good Basic Reference,"This was one of the first books I bought when I decided that I needed some reference books. I still turn to it regularly, especially for the pattern designs in the back. This book provides a good overall reference and covers the basics that everyone should know, especially a beginner. I don't know if I would want to teach myself to knit from this book, although it does cover the very basics. I especially appreciate the breadth of the book and the pattern reference which is a good starter reference, rather than buying a second book. My first knitting book was the Leisure Arts ""Learn to Knit"" booklet and this book would make a good companion to that for a complete beginner. For the price I think it is one of the best overall references for a beginning or relatively inexperienced knitter. For a more advanced knitter, or one who is adventuresome, I recommend Montse Stanley's ""Knitter's Handbook"" although that does not have a stitch pattern guide."
5,Helpful.,Answers my knitting questions & then some! Lots of useful illustrations which are easy to follow. Many useful patterns also.
3,KNITTING BOOK,"I paid over twenty dollars for the Complete Book of Knitting and was dissapointed when it arrived, it looked well used, when ordering the book there were lots of 'used' but I opted for the new. The book itself was a gift and my daughter in law loves it, anything you ever want to know about knitting is in that book."
4,World Woods in Color,What made this book so great it is exactly what I was looking for. I'm a wood turner and I like to pass on the information about wood used in bowls customers purchase. The information also helps me with matching woods and finishing the product.Steve Portrey
2,Addendum,"To prospective buyers it may be helpful to know that this is a British book: the selection of names is heavily influenced by this. For example ""lacewood"" is given here in the literal sense, as quartersawn wood of a species with high rays, with a ""lacy"" ray fleck, originally Platanus spp. Later (although the book omits to mention this) the woods of the Proteaceae (both the Australian silky oaks and the South American roupala) were also so used. The American use of ""lacewood"" for the Australian silky oaks, however sawn, is somewhat of a misnomer."
4,A little out of date but helpful to have.,"This book was written in the 60's and could use a revision. One thing that isn't bad but you should know is that the author is from Britain and he writes the book from the position of wood availability and use from a British point of view. This is not a drawback but when it comes to me getting or identifying woods I can get in Colorado (USA) it is a shift in perspective. If you are a novice woodworker or make simple items in your garage and don't need to know every detail about every wood species, I wouldn't invest the money in this one. If you are a serious woodworker and you are working with woods both domestic and exotic, this book would be nice to have around."
4,Not your average comic book!!,"In Maus I and Maus II, Art Spiegelman takes an innovative and creative approach to telling a story that many know all to well. Maus is the story of one man's journey through the maze of Hitler's journey. By using the unconventional technique of the graphic novel, Art Spiegelman places the reader in a setting where the descriptive pictures tell a story which no words could parallel. The story of Vladek's journey captures the reader, and as a result Maus is an easy read."
5,Masterpiece,Few books (even Pulitzer Prize winners like this one) create their own genre. Art Spiegelman is a genius. The book was fantastic the first time I read it and even better the second time (when I read it again).
5,I did not learn any of this stuff in school,"I really liked this comic, I learned all sorts of things I had never known or considered about the Holocaust, or WWII. Though the animal heads dim the impact of the events, I think they are absolutely necessary to get through some of the gruesomest parts."
4,My reflection,I really enjoyed this book.The art in the books makes the story easier to understand and it provides shows you exactly what the author is trying to express. This in depth story about the Holocaust really helps you understand exactly how the Jews were treated. I highly recommended this book.It will definitely teach you a lesson.
2,Hi Dan. by Nicole B,"I think that Maus was an informative book. Even though it was completely in comics, it told the story very well. I think that the book would have been better if it wasn't completely written in comics. Another thing that I didn't like about the book was the fact that it shows all of the characters as mice. This was confusing at times."
1,Judea Declares War on Germany....again.,"Here's another in a long line of products designed to focus exclusively on the Jewish experience of WWII. By either completely omitting the experiences of peoples from other nations, (except the Poles, who are presented in this book as pigs), this book is a fine example of the Jews exclusive claim to the title of World Champion of All Victims. As with the majority of Holocaust(tm)survivor stories, the majoriy of the situations referred to in this book have been shown to be inaccuracies, distortions, or just outright lies.There's no business like Shoah Business and this book is just one more Jewish product desigend to pull at your heartstrings while emptying your pockets."
1,40% of the truth is not the full truth.,"This book is to shape Americans youngsters minds with use of half-truths. The Jewish author with great mastery uses the same type of weaponry Jews were subjected to, just to name a few; racism, prejudice, self-centeredness, telling half-truths if not lies.http://holocaustforgotten.com/"
1,foolish book,"Mouse ? After reading I was about to think that german nazi concentration camps built on Poland teritories to exterminate Poles and polish Jews was founded by polish people or polish Jews. Completly confused book.But I have read the other book about this field worth advertising:Forgotten Holocaust: The Poles Under German Occupation 1939-1944 by Richard C. Lukas, Norman Davies (Paperback - July 2001)"
5,a teenagers point of veiw,Maus is a good book about the holocaust for anyone including people who would rather look at pictures then read. art speigelman's unique style of using animals instead of people put the events of the holocaust in a different perspective and showed how evil Hitler and the Nazis really were.
5,An astounding piece of non-fiction,What an elaborately told tale. Mr. Spiegelman tells a heart-wrenching story using approachable metaphor. This book is an emotional and powerful read.
4,Surprised,"Wow, this survivor's tale of the Aushowitz prison camp is extremely poignant. Spiegelman creates a cartoon representation of what his father went through without trivilizing the events. He depicts the Jewish people as mice, the Nazis as cats, the Americans are dogs, and so on. As a survivor's tale it works, but Spiegelman adds another layer. He didn't understand his dad and fleshes this out in the pages. He depicts all the arguements and fights that they had between interviews. This book is a journey of the author to fully understand his father. To do that he had to understand Aushowitz; to do that he had to understand how his father survived."
4,Who cares is this is overrated?,"Maus this and Maus thatI had been Reading rave reviews for this book and a lot of complaints for it being overhypedNow I have had the chance of Reading the whole piece and I can tell you that this is a very honest work, very personal, not an oversimplification of the holocaust, it is part of the life of the author's family.The format allows for a quick read, but you might misss details if you fly over the pages."
3,An Offensive Non-Attack on Political Correctness,"Having read this, I also take offense at the portrayal of Poles as pigs. Is there ANY other nationality, at ANY other time, which has successfully been portrayed as pigs, and such material been so acclaimed and even used in the classroom? I rather doubt it. Nor is this comic a repudiation of political correctness. After all, Poles (and Christians) are about the only safe groups to villify in public, if only because neither are politically powerful. Could I change my mind in this assessment? Yes. Were Spiegelman to write another cartoon book, this time depicting Jews as pigs, and there were no protests, THEN would I ""lighten up"" and accept the line about the current portrayal of Poles as pigs being actually non-offensive and no big deal."
3,"Dramatic, Imaginative, and Insensitive","As a Polish-American, I also find the depiction of Poles as pigs to be highly insulting. This is whether Spiegelman intended this or not. And this insult can only be heightened by the usual anti-Polish bias of most popular-level Holocaust materials. For those who do not see this, picture the following alternative cartoon: Jews as pigs being led to the slaughterhouse. Or even this: The Germans are rattlesnakes, the Poles are mongooses, and the Jews are rats. How would these alternative play out? Get the point?"
4,"Moving, if a bit biast","When I picked up this book I didn't expect to be so drawn in by the story, despite the simple art design. I have to admit the story is quite worthy of the prize it received but, like others have said, it is a bit biast in that it focuses mainly on the persecution of the Polish Jews when there were many, many others who died along with them, stuck in the same boat.Still, considering what Art's father went through, one can't blame him for having a sort of narrow vision of events; because he was, half the time, trying to use his brain to get out of situations. Even so, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, dramatic read or who wants to know more about the Holocaust (from one man's point of view)."
2,Blind to his own racism,"I was predisposed to like this book. The Holocaust is a subject of consummate importance, which deserves to be revisited in every media, as a cautionary reminder. Unfortunately Spiegelman's pen reveals just how easy it is to slip into the kind of mindless, dehumanizing racism which led to the Nazi theories initially responsible for the hideous brutality they unleashed. Although the non-Jewish, non-Nazi characters in this book are portrayed (as recalled by the author's father) by their actions as good people who actually helped, or tried to help the poor ""mice,"" they are nevertheless depicted as pigs. What is the message? What kind of ingrained prejudice is at work here? Obviously the same prejudice which allows so many readers to laud this book and ignore the ugly irony that spoils it."
5,Reality in a Graphic Novel. Art Spiegelman takes the best of George Orwell.,"This two volume set is one of the best works of art of our time. It shows the Holocaust in an unprecedented way later followed by Steven Spielber's famous movie ""An American Tail"". The idea of portraying Jews as mice, Nazis as cats and so on, the comic book format, and the memoir way in which the story is told is the perfect combination to introduce all kinds of readers to such a significant and complex subject.An American TailAnimal Farm"
3,A moving story,"This graphic novel tells the tale of Vladek and Anja Speigelman, who were survivors of the Holocaust. It is delivered to us in the form of a graphic novel. This format is what one would find in a comic book. Don't let the format scare you away from reading it.The author also includes his troubled relationship with his father, and the brother who did not survive the war. Each book is well done, and the illustrations are moving. This is not a book from the young reader. However, it can deliver a good message to the teenagers much quicker and more to the point than some history books.I thought the subject was very hard to read at times, but it is well worth it. We get an insider's glimpse into the beginning of the war, the rounding up of the Jews in ghettos, the degrading conditions, the fear, the hiding, the hunger, and sadness. Our couple manage to stay together until they arrive in the main death camp.Read this story, and remember what had happened. We can not forget."
5,A Must-Read,"Despite the approachable medium of the grpahic novel, Maus is an intense experience that I think everyone should read. This novel is NOT for minors."
5,Great,"I am combining volumes one and two. Volume one is great and it is no wonder it won a Pulitzer Prize. Even if you are not fond of comics or graphic novels, if you are at all interested in history (or WW2 specifically), you should try this. I enjoyed it enough that I bought both for my mother-in-law, who likes reading non-fiction historical accounts."
2,"No Doubt What 'Schweine"" Means","Perhaps Spiegelman's choice of pigs to represent Poles is innocent. However, there is not doubt what the Germans meant when they used the epithet ""Schweine"" (swine) for the subjugated Poles. To the extent that Spiegelman is copying the Germans' vocabulary, he is taking part in their mentality. If, however, the choice of pigs is meant to imply that the Poles were well-fed, then this is an utter travesty of history. Fact is that, while Poles were better off than the Jews, it was not by much. The Poles under German occupation had very little to eat compared with the French, Belgians, etc., under German occupation. And, by showing Poles killing Jews who returned for their property, he is distorting events by depicting something as normal that happened to perhaps several hundred Jews out of some 200,000 who likewise came to reclaim their property without incident. In any case, the anti-Polish slant is rather obvious."
3,vgmani,I dont know how to rate this!! The book... I am yet to read! But I received collectorS edition within a collector edition! The book is printed upside down while the cover page is printed straight!
1,Aren't Pigs a Less-Than-Kosher Choice?,"The choice of cats (for Germans), and mice (for Jews) does not carry any strong emotional connotations. Pigs certainly do. If this is unclear, check the dictionary. So why did Spiegelman choose pigs for Poles? I am sure that the Polish child or teen who sees this comic will be delighted to see his nationality thus depicted. Thank you, Mr. Spiegelman."
3,"Great concept, unbalanced execution","Quirky and offbeat, ""Rocket Science"" doesn't follow the usual tropes for teen ""sex"" comedies, and American movies in general. In this, we see that hard work and determination don't always equate to overcoming monumental obstacles (no matter what the rewards), such as disabilities. For neither the girl nor glory can the protagonist defeat a stuttering problem that proves ruinous to future on his high school's debating team.On the plus side, ""Rocket Science"" has a lot of interesting scharacters and situations. I't also pretty damn funny, and Anna Kendrick is fetching, as always. But the story doesn't always zip along, and past a certain point, the plot is unable to resolve itself in a cohesive and meaningful way, finally ending in a rather rnadom and certainly unsatisfying way. See it once."
5,Great Map,"My sister loved this map as a Christmas gift. She loves to travel and find new and exciting destinations! Only one flaw, Russia and surrounding areas are all written in the Russian language. It makes the map a little more interesting."
1,This is Bad,"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."
2,"Love, etc",I bought this because I liked Nothing to be Frightened of so much. I wanted to read more of Julian Barnes. REALLY disaggpointed with this one.
3,"""Commercial Grade""","this was relatively easy to put together, I was surprised there were no brakes on the wheels, considering it is 'commercial grade' so it does wobble/move around quite a bit when you hang heavier garments on it.other than that it seems to do the job, size measurements were accurate."
3,Garment rack,"This rack is very sturdy and strong and exactly what we were looking for. My only complaint is that the holes on one of the poles did not line up with the holes in the top rail, so we were unable to put the bolts in place. Since this didn't impact our use of the rack, we chose to not return it, but we don't expect this to happen on such a simple design."
5,Garment racks,Absolutely please with the stability and ease of assembly. I would safely recommend these racks to anyone who needs this type of rack.
5,"commercial grade, nice finish","just as advertised this is a very solid, sturdy rack with a nice quality chrome finish. very sturdy rack and very capable of handling 250 LBS or more with no bending or sagging."
5,"Outstanding product, easy assembly, fast shipping.","I received 2 racks exactly when promised and had them both put together in less than 15 minutes (using an allen wrench drill bit). Racks are very sturdy and extremely useful in our alterations business, where we have long gowns and many articles of clothing to hang. I will be ordering a couple more as soon as needed. *UPDATE* I just ordered/received 2 more racks and they came in great condition. The packaging was fairly beaten, but it did not hurt the product. One of the racks were not shipped, but the seller sent it immediately after notification. I still had both racks within a week after initial shipment."
5,Very Sturdy!,"I ordered this rack for my mother and hoped that the one and only review would be true. It was absolutely true. My mother is extremely happy with this rack. In fact, she is ordering another one! If you are looking for a sturdy, heavy duty rack, this is the one."
5,Sturdy and Idiot Proof,This arrived a few days after ordering and took this midwest grandma 12 minutes to assemble!
4,Garment Rack,"Sturdy. Easy to put together. Perfect for wardrobe, for Portraits. Everyone loves hanging their clothing on it. I was surprised at the size, but that bc I didn't check the dimensions. Lol"
3,I like them ok,they are lighter in weight than I would have liked. But they are fineWhen we move them around they dont really have that sturdiness thatI would've liked to have found.
5,Very good product.,"This is what I am looking for. I made a little modification by adding another rod to it, so I doubled the space without any problem. Highly recommended."
4,Garment Rack,"Strong and sturdy but the holes in the top bar were oval, not round, and were a little too small for the screws, so it was VERY hard to get the screws all the way seated. Also, because the holes were oval the alignment ended up slightly off and only one of the bottom support bars fit snugly. Overall it is a strong product and I am 98% happy with it."
5,Sturdy Easy to put together Worth it,"When the box arrived I was a little nervous. A bunch of metal parts, no instructions and not even a picture of the item on the box. I thought, o great...how will I figure this out. Seriously, I am not ""handy"" and I figured it out and had the item together in 20 minutes. easy to put together and sturdy. Usually I wont buy anything that costs this much to ship, but this was worth it."
3,"He still comes back with yet, another hit!","This album keeps on bringing this phenominal artist to the top. After releasing one of the greatest albums of all time, he comes back with a few more hits in this album. Because of the success of the last album ( El Dolor), this one gets underated by it's critics. As a die hard fan of bachata, I've noticed that it is very hard to keep coming back year after year with a number one hit. Luis Vargas has been able to do this for many years. He is still one of the greatest in his music and will continue to be. I highly recommend this album, although not as much as ""El Dolor"", which I strongly recommend. I give this one a 3.5 stars."
5,Luis Vargas is the Best Bachatero of all time!!,"Not sure how anyone can give this album anything less than 5 stars.Luis Vargas is very special. I think this is one of his best, you really have to know bachata to appreciate this one. 5 estrellas!!!"
3,Not what was really expected!,"""Volvio el Dolor"" was the hottest bachata song of 1998 from the pioneer of bachata, Luis Vargas. However, Desamor, doesn't bring the same overall punch that ""El Dolor"" has. ""Tarde Te Arrepientes"" and ""Me Equivoque"" are two bachatas that are highly recommended. The other bachatas are tolerable, but ""Rosa Prohibida"" comes off as a 2 1/2 minutes of wasted money where he talks in a raspy voice. The Bachatarengues in this album are on point with its very-good criollo rhythm in check. Overall, this album is for die-hard Luis Vargas' fans who can't stop their pionero's collection of hits."
5,Great translation of the Bible for personal study,"I like the amplified version over other versions of the Bible because everything is explained in context. If the verse refers to other scripture, that scripture referance appears right there in parenthesis. Word meanings and background info is also right there in the text. This is the first translation I have read that prompted me to read through the whole Bible. I would recommend it to anyone who would like a more in-depth perspective or for someone having trouble reading more traditional text such as the KJV."
1,Amplified Bible Mass Market,"I don't recommend this item. The Amplified Bible is an awesome translation, but this mass market edition's font is extremely small, 6, maybe 8 pt type. I had to return it. Reading a font this small, regardless how wonderful the information, is too tiring on the eyes. I have excellent vision, and am young. This was excessive strain."
5,The Bible Of Bibles!!!!!,"The Amplified Bible is the bible of bibles! 12years ago when I started reading the bible I started with the NIV which I still recomend to beginners. The Amplified has become my primary bible! Alot of reviewers here recomend that you use it as a great second bible, but I have no problem using as my primary, I just fell in love with it. I have owned and deeply studied many translations NIV, NLT, KJV, NASB, ESV, RSV, NAB, NJB, the list goes on and on. I highly reccomend the Amplified Bible. Once you get used to all the parenthesis and brackets, diving into and digging into the Word Of God becomes a pure joy!"
5,My Favorite Version of the Bible,"The Old Testament was written in Hebrew ... the New Testament was written in Greek ... Jesus generally spoke in Aramaic ...The only way to procure an accurate understanding of the Holy Scriptures would be for you to become a master of, at least, these three languages ... or ... you could get a copy of the Amplified Bible, where all that has been taken care of.The Amplified Bible expounds on the meanings of various words with brakets [] that offer insights into what is being conveyed. These words in brakets become wonderful fodder for meditation!If you want to understand God's word, as it was originally intended, you can't do any better than this.Verily, I'm a musician ... I like things that are amplified. 8o)pax, Alan Horvath ..."
5,"A ""must"" for study","I have ""worn out"" two copies of the Amplified and am now ordering a 3rd copy. I study from a variety of Bible translations (NASV, NIV, Phillips, Message, others) but wouldn't be without an Amplified for more complete view of word choices from original language."
4,great addition,The amplified translation is a great addition to my study books. This is an inexpensive model but it is just fine for study at home.
3,It's okay,"I like the contents and written style of the Amplified Bible and have no complaints about that, actually like it a lot. But I purchased the Kindle version and am having great difficulty finding chapters and verses, difficulty manuvering around in the Bible. It make s me quite frustrated. I had anticipated simply typing the reference and having it pop up. However, I must go to the beginning, find the table of contents, find the Old or New testement, find the book, find the chapter, then scroll to the verse. Altogether it takes quite a few steps to find the desired chapter and verse. I am greatly dissappointed in this purchase. On the positive side, it was inexpensive."
4,Amplified Bible,"The 4 stars review was chosen for the content and comments brought in this Bible, which is one of the best I have ever read.What I really liked in this digital version is its portability, since I can read it anywhere in my IPad, even when travelling. The paper version is kind of heavy.What I do not like is that the links do not function very properly, what makes the user need to tap them several times to make them work."
2,Amplified Bible,I'm very frustrated because I don't know how to get to chapter & verse I want to read. That's stressful.
3,Poor quality paper!,I purchased this amplified bible hoping that it would hold up to actual use since my first one didn't. Unfortunately the paper still does not hold up when you use the bible regularly. I would highly suggest getting an amplified bible with a durable leather cover or make sure you cover this one with a durable cover.
4,"A good resource, not a main source",I admit the writing is small but so is the cost. I use it primarily as an added resource in my study preparations.
3,Getting with the program,"This is a good companion to take along with you when you go to worship, it's used to grasp a stronger feel, an a better interpretation of the ( K J V ) King James Version by pastors at times when delivering their message to their congregation."
4,HEAVY,I have just started toing to a church that uses the amplified version. Only this was I am 70 yrs old and the book gets very heavy. I now use my old metel computer laptop stand as a book stand and it works great.
3,Type size too small,"A wonderful translation, but type size too small and no margins to write notes:-(. I wish I had spent more and gotten a larger version."
4,I like it,I Like it. It is a little diffrent than the other translations I have. It reads very well and with a modern tone.
2,Downloadable Version - Hard to get to the chapters.,"I love the Amplified bible... period. But it is so hard to zip to the right chapters. If you are following along in church, you will not be able to get to the right place in time to read along. That needs to be improved before I'll recommend the downloadable version.Each book has an introduction. In the introduction are groups of chapters by topic. For example, in the introduction of any book of the bible, you will see ""The redemption: chapters 12-20."" Your pastor says to turn to chapter 16, verse (forget it - you won't remember the verse). You have to choose either chapter 12 which is underlined or chapter 20 (also underlined) and scroll forwards or backwards until you get to chapter 16. Then remember the verse. A stylus would help but who remembers those things? I am using a Kindle Paperwhite."
2,Ok,Not quite what I expected. Functionally the book is excellent but there were some spotting on some of the pages that I did not expect.
5,Amplified Bible Large Print,"Amplified Bible,. Large PrintI love this Bible, I would highly recommend this Bible for anyone who wants a more in depth Understanding of The Word Of God."
5,I got exactly what I wanted!,"I had already used an Amplified Bible that belonged to a friend, but had problems reading the ""small"" print. The large print in this Bible is exactly what I needed and wanted. Also the binding is great. Right product, right price, and right on time. Thanks!"
2,NO VERSE NUMBERS:,"Navigation problems just like all Kindle books. Books have page numbers, so why can't the brilliant minds behind Kindle accommodate readers needs?"
2,Needs to be user friendly,"I was very excited when I purchased the bible, but unfortunately that didn't last too long. There is no quick index button to navigate through the book. It has been very tidious trying to go quickly from verse to verse through different books and chapters. Not at all practical for bible studies."
2,Not user friendly,"This Bible has all the correct amplified wording; it is just hard to get to a specific passage. I have purchased two Bibles to keep on my Kindle. With this amplified, at least I can get to a certain book; then it's page by page to find the passage you want. Fine if your reading cover to cover. Not what I had in mind."
5,excellente,It's great to be able to compare KJV and Amplified. I like Amplified because it has in parenthesis all the possible translated words from Greek/Hebrew. And KJV is such a widely used Bible that it's important to see.
4,My Husband Likes It.,A small bible that is written to where anyone that can read can understand and apply it to their own life
4,Awesome!,Awesome awesome book. Of course it is the bible but I have enjoyed this one much. I didn't give perfect score because of the ease of use. Content is perfect but I do wish they would give us a search box where we can go from one verse to another in a flash. It is time consuming to go back to the front find the right book click on it and then find the verse. A search box that is always available would make it much quicker to find the next verse when I am at church or a bible study. That would make this ebook much more perfect for me.
4,Amplified bible,I have read this version of the bible for over thirty years. For bible studies it has been the closest to the original Greek of all the versions I have tried.
2,"""Amplified"" ? Or, Choose Your Own Word","I have always disliked the Amplified Bible. I thought it was tedious, and a general nuisance, and wound up returning every copy I ever bought, to try it, and try it again, wanting to like it. My final opinion was that it should have been allowed to go out of print years ago. Some swear by it, and consider one's library lacking if one does not possess it. I just have one question: WHY???? What is so great about the Amplified Bible? The prob here is that when it 'amplifies' a word or a phrase, one must make one's own choice on the particular word---whether or not one has a background in Greek. Then, some will go off on a wrong interpretation. It is still a very difficult read. It's an accurate translation, though, and formal equivalence. If you must have an Amplified, which seems to have a 'cult' following, then by all means get one. It is still a knock-down drag-out to read."
1,The item received is not same as the photo shown on Amzon,"I believed it is an older version than the one shown on Amazon. I felt like being cheated. However, it is cheap. So, I just accepted it."
4,AMPLIFIED BIBLE - KINDLE VERSION,"Having been a caregiver most of my life (as well as worked for hospice), it was/is an honor to be able to provide care and comfort to the failing, of all ages. (Being a retiree and older myself now, I still participate - but not as much, and in a more volunteer capacity.) In addition to providing 'domestic' care and companionship, I was/am often asked by the patients to read from the Bible. (I have many versions in my library to use or reference, and as I am knew to the kindle format - this is my newest acquisition.) Usually I would/will read the 23 Psalm or some other passage that provides hope and comfort, and this AMPLIFIED BIBLE is a nice version to use, and easy to read with a nice font size and is easy for the patient/person to apprehend while being read to. Some people prefer a less formal 'format' (without all the 'thee's and thou's'), and that makes this a desirable version for that purpose.Recommended."
4,"Great Bible overall, however...","This Bible is very well made. The print is just the right size; big enough to read without glasses, but not too big. The Bible is a good size, and works well for taking to church. The paper is nice, and not too thin. The gold edge on the pages looks beautiful. The print is dark enough to read without difficulty. There are very few footnotes. This does not matter to me because they are usually so small that I cannot read them. I do wish that this had been available with a genuine leather cover. The ""bonded leather"" cover is not as soft to the touch as I would have liked. The cover seems to be mostly comprised of the substance the leather is ""bonded"" to, with very little leather. I never considered returning it, as it is perfect, with the exception of the cover."
3,Amplified Bible,The bible was a little thicker than I preferred...it was in okay condition...I contacted the seller who was willing to refund my money but I never got to send it back....It was paperback...which I just dont prefer..overall okay experience...
3,Reference Bible,The customers who bought this item said that the print was too fine. I opted to look at other reference bibles.
1,Careful- don't read too much into it,"Although it may be helpful in seeing a range of possible meanings for words, it has often been used as a witness for formulating false or misleading doctrines. Just because a word can have a particular semantic range doesn't mean one can pick and choose the meaning they want. A term must be understood properly in its immediate and larger context to avoid mis-understanding the text. Read other translations first, and multiple commentaries before advocating a new-found meaning for a verse."
2,"Great Book, but print in Mass Market addition is too small","The ""Mass Market"" edition is a great value on a great work, but the print is way too small for most readers"
2,not good,"This is not good quality as I expected, It looks more like false one-- I mean the print looks so uncomfortable to read. I gave up the idea to buy more for gifts."
4,Great translation. Shame about the publisher :(,"Without a doubt The Amplified Bible has always been ahead of its time. It's intuitive, readable, a great study tool. But Zondervan - what a disappointment. Since finding my way back to God in January this year I have purchased many versions of the Bible from Amazon and always purchase quality productions. I am pleased I added The Amplified to my library but i wish it wasn't produced by Zondervan; for a ""top grain leather"" binding it leaves much to be desired. The second rate paper stock used tell the same tale. One thing that must be said, however, is that AMAZON.COM never cease to amaze me with their speed of delivery - ordered on a Thursday afternoon and delivered to me in Sydney (Australia) on the following Monday morning is fantastic. By the way, I strongly recommend you buy the Lockman Foundation wide column edition of the NASB for Bible study (ISBN 1581350716). It's readable and has perfect quality (with a genuine life-time guarantee!)"
5,Great for Serious Bible Students!,"It would be impossible to get the entirety of the Greek and Hebrew language within the English text because the original languages are so expansive. This however is accurate and lends more insight into the original rendered meaning. It is a joy to have and to really study God's word with.I am disappointed in the cover material. It was advertised as ""leather bound"". Indeed is not. That needs to be corrected, and compensation should be applied to those of us who ordered the genuine leather."
5,great product,This bible that I purchased is great.The large print make it so much easier to read.Quality leather at a good price. Marion
5,Eye Opener,This Amplified Bible has given me so much understanding of what I am reading when I study bible scripture. I find myself absorbing more of the word and feel empowered when I am finished my study. I read the King James version but I always feel like I comprehend more with the Amplified version of the bible. I love it. Excellent tutorial.
5,My Favorite Version,Exactly what I needed to read in bed when it's quiet and no heavy book to hold. Helps when you are a hospital patient or in a rehab center!
3,GOOD BOOK,THIS IS A GOOD BOOK BUT THE PRINT WAS STILL TOO SMALL FOR ME.. IT IS A SOFTCOVER WHICH DOESNT LAST LONG AND THE EDGES OF THE COVER CURL AND BEND.. IF YOU PUT IT IN A BIBLE COVER IT WOULD HELP IT LAST LONGER. IT JUST WASNT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR..I WOULD RECOMMEND..
3,just alright,just need some other translations. It's not a kind of bible you want to stick to pick some other translation to go with this..
4,KINDLE VERSION,"I really like my Kindle Version of the Bible. It does everything: defines words, searches the whole Bible for words, useful without any connection, saves my place! The only reason it is not a 5 star is that after I have done a search and I click on something in the search, I can't go back to the original search list."
5,"Amplified Bible, Large Print",I Love this version of the Bible. The large print edition is great. The summaries at the beginning of each book are very helpful.
5,WAIT! There's another Suspiria album you should buy!,"Suspiria is an absolutely amazing band. Matthew Carl Lucian has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard. Combine that with ingenious synthesized music and some of the most beautifully poetic lyrics I have ever heard, and you have yourself one good band.However, I will say that while Dancefloor Tragedy is a good compilation of Suspiria's work, it is nothing compared to the sheer masterpiece that is another of their albums, Drama. The full vocal version of ""The Treacher Song"" appears on Drama, and it is frankly the best song that I have ever heard, period. (The version of this song that appears on Dancefloor Tragedy omits most of the vocals.)I beg of you, look for Suspiria's _Drama_. You will not be disappointed. It is a bit difficult to find, but if you look on some of those more obscure online music stores that cater to gothic and industrial music, they might have it."
4,DANCEFLOOR GOTHIC ROCK,"This great album is a mixture of rock and groove and it works out well. There is a Depeche Mode cover on this album (Behind the Wheel) and if you think highly of those guys then there is a good chance that Suspiria will also be to your liking. This duo follows the 80s goth-disco tradition founded by such groups as Alien Sex Fiend and Specimen but it also contains that high pitched guitar style that makes gothic rock so unusual. The singer uses a very old world accent in his singing which, along with synthetic organs, gives this music a very dreamy undertone. Best track is 'Allegedly, Dancefloor Tragedy'."
2,Not Accurate,"The strips are packed individually with a set of basic instructions printed on the outer packaging. My problem was that they didn't work so great. During the time I was actually ovulating it showed a faint line, which the directions advise to be a negative. In the end I resulted to guess work. Maybe I just had a batch that's color intensity was defectedd but I definitely used them correctly.... I mean there is only one way to dip a stip in the cup for 3 seconds."
3,Your Mileage May Vary,"Reading LH strips -- of any brand, not just these -- is a judgement call. Since there's always LH in your body, the test isn't positive until the lines are about the same darkness. The first few cycles into using these, I would get a line that I wasn't sure was quite dark enough and would go on to ovulate 12-24 hours later, as confirmed by a basal temperature chart. That same line has also proven to be a false positive sometimes.If you want to conceive as fast as possible, don't rely on these alone to time your trying. Sperm can live in your body for 4-5 days, so your fertility window is much longer than an OPK will tell you."
2,"Cheap, but poor performance","These aren't great. They are really hard to tell if you are positive, my husband even took one that turned up very close to positive (not quite, but close). After a positive on the 2nd, 7th, and 17th day of this month, I really have no clue what is going on without my temps or other body signs. I took them 2x a day, as directed and really just have no clue what's going on. I am really very disappointed with these strips."
1,THEY DONT WORK!,I purchased these last week and received a positive result every day! I decided to take them to see what a negative looks like since I KNEW I WAS ON CYCLE DAY 5. Well it was positive and it continues to be positive! Every other test that I bought after this test says negative. I am not scheduled to ovulate in another 13 days or so. I know I would not have so many positives back to back. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! GO TO EARLYPREGNANCYTEST WEBSITE. Most ppl use those and I haven't heard about any issues.
1,doesn't work,"These tests doesn't work at all. I used it to test for ovulation from day9 to day 21 after first day of period and there was never once any positive result, it's always a very faint line comparing to the control line. I thought my LH level was so low that it was below detection and turned back to guessing work. After 6 monthes of not being pregnant, I decided to test for ovulation again with these test trips and the First response brand that I got from costco. on day 16, while the costco strips showed a clear positive, these are still showing the very faint line which indicates negative. Don't waste you time and money on these total garbage."
5,They work great! : ),So i was a little worried at first about using these i wasnt sure if they worked but me and my fiance are trying to conceive (as i have gone baby crazed -lol-) and im so tired of spending 20+ bucks on tests and only getting like 2 or 2 max if there on sale.. i started going to the dollar store and those are ok but clearly your still getting more for your money here.. i got 50 tests for under $15..25 ovu and 25 preg. i have only tested for ovu twice...yesterday and today and i received positives and just be safe i had my fiance test one for me and of course his came out negative : )..therefore tests work and im very happy.
4,Great deal,"This item was shipped sooner than expected. Love the look and weight of the plate. I shopped around and found that it was much cheaper than the dealership offered me. Only problem is that the screw covers and the screws did not fit my front plate on my Acura TL, so I would advise you to keep your factory one handy. Very classy and added the perfect touch to my car."
