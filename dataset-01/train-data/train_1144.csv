5,one of the best discs of last year...or any year,"I really, really liked Altramar's ""St. Francis and the Minstrels of God."" I am even more fond of this latest release from them, ""Celtic Wanderers: The Pilgrim's Road."" In these settings of the songs of various early Celtic saints, Dorian has out done itself. The music, the singing, and the sound are all outstanding. This has to be one of the best discs put out last year or any year."
1,Just For Cats toy,This product is not worth the money you pay for it......the holes will not line up with the clips therefore the material ripped due to being tugged trying to line it up....my cat never even got to play in it at all . Waste of money!!
1,Poorly Made,I tried to set up the activity center but the pieces did not fit. The parts weren't distributed correctly so I got an extra side piece instead of the top piece where the ball was suppose to hang off of. The area where the cat is supposed to hide is made out of a piece of a plastic bag that does not even fit the connecting pipes set up. I do not recommend this product at all.
1,I was SO excited for my cats but....,"I was SO excited for my cats when I ordered and received this,but when I went to set it up for them there was TWO left sides and not a right.Where you hook it on the sides on the front and attach the poles.I am very disappointed in HARTZ!I am pretty sure Amazon claimed this was new NOT used.Perhaps the Hartz company messed it up when packing it for sale.Well I'm not wasting anymore money to send this back to Amazon.Well it's all set up (sort of) lol.Well if my cats are happy with it,I'm happy with it....I guess."
2,One star for each diva...,"This is a weird compilation by K-tel. First with the Ms. Turners' tracks we get her singing in an unfamiliar country setting. She lends her vocal energy to these songs, but the arrangements are pretty much standard stuff, twanging guitars etc. No source of material or recording dates are listed. My further research found they come from the early to mid 70s. Perhaps completists will find this of interest, but those wanting the ""Queen of Rock"" will be disapointed. The tracks from Gloria Gaynor are more in line with what she is famous for. However, two key songs ""I Will Survive"" and ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" are heavily synthesized remakes, not even close to the originals' musical energy. In the cover of ""Everytime You Go Away"" Gaynor delivers nothing new or special. I don't see the point of this K-tel mish-mash. You'll be better off with a separate album for each diva!"
4,Nice quality color prints.,"When looking online to purchase this series of pictures, I was shocked to find that they were $100+ each. So I found a more economical way and ended up buying these prints and framing them myself. I was very satisfied with the quality of the prints, they are done on an average paper stock, and the colors and nice and vibrant. I would recommend these prints to others."
2,Vertict is still out on this one....,"I have been using this product for over three weeks, and am yetto see any of its ""potent"" results. I must say it certainly isa good moisturizer, however I don't think I needed to spend$45.00 to get a moisturizer."
1,did'nt work for me,"after using this product day by day until finish it; I can tell you I just waste my money and my time, I have sun spots on my arms that this product didn't clear at all."
2,Michael Jackson Cream?,"""Nicknamed the Michael Jackson Cream."" ????Just a reminder that, Michael Jackson DID have the skin disease, VITILIGO, which spread beyond the help of make-up - THAT is why he and his dermatologist resorted to using a lightning agent, in order to lighten the remaining dark spots and even out his skin tone."
1,Don't WASTE your money!!!,"I have purchased this product and have been using it exactly the way it's directed to and I have not seen any results at all! So please people if you want to waste your money, feel free to order this item, it does not do what it says it does."
1,No Effects!,"I purchased this item also in combination with the soap for skin brightening. To my surprise, nothing happens either. I am not sure why this products are recommended and do not do any thing as promised.Totally disappointed."
1,dosen't work,I'm a dark skinned African American woman. i ordered the large jar and have been using it for about 7 months. no change at all. this product doesn't work.
1,does not do anything!!,"I bought this cream with the hope of lightening spots on my skin and overall skin brightening. It was a wasted investment. It is a good moisturizer, that is why it got a star. Every skin is different. MAy be someone else will have better luck with it."
1,"IT BURNS, PRECIOUS, IT BURNS US","AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!The burning, the itchiness, the sleepless nights, the PAIN! This horrible stuff is worse than the infection itself. I have never crawled into a bathtub at one in the morning so fast in my life. I couldn't wash it out fast enough, it was so horrible. Stay away from it. STAY AWAY!"
5,Fantastic,"This CD is fantastic. Omar Lopez is an awesome musicain, and I love the ethnic blend of his music. As a classically trained violinist, it is inspiring to listen to it, over and over again ; filled with lots of riffs and grooves that will definitely help and inspire any classically trained musician venturing into the world of playing contempory music. A must have in one's CD collection, to listen to, or as an inspiration to other musicans ."
5,The best book on UNIX so far...,"If you don't want to get lost in the complex but powerful UNIX operating system, buy this book immediately. Covering topics such as how many partitions you should have to file and directory structure to Perl programming, ""Unix Unleashed"" explains in a technical yet clear manner the intricacies of this OS. You're a Linux user and you are wondering wether you should buy ""Unix Unleashed"" or not? Stop wondering and get out your cash. The mythical ""UNIX guru"" status will be within your reach after reading this masterpiece."
4,very good condition to be used book,"The book was in very good condition to be a used book. Impressive. It did took many days to deliver considering we boought other books in same time and arrive earlier. But satisfactory. It did arrive in time they said so, so not bad alt all"
5,Nice sippy,I have used these with both my children. They have never leaked. I can toss one in my bag and not worry. I find them much easier to clean than other sippys. The valve is very simple to take on and off. I only wash them by hand. Putting any plastic cup/lid in the dishwasher (or microwave for that matter) will warp the plastic and cause leaking.
5,My son loves these cups!,"These cups have served us well through all stages, and are supportive of a child's needs. I feel that even though the cups do leak out of the little hole in the top ("" a vent?"") of the green nipple and also out of the cap area, it is very little and only seems to be from lying down. My sons absolutely LOVES these ""zippy cups"". I can't say enough about the durability and comfort, as well as fun colors. Extremely well made, in my opinion, I have never felt that these cups are leaching plastic byproducts, even when left in the sun. Never makes what is inside smell bad due to the plastic. Despite the many parts, I have only had positive experiences with all of the Avent design cups. They wash up easily with an Avent brush, or in the dishwasher. The handles are great, and the different nipple designs are great for the maturing mouth. Definitely recommended!"
1,Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning!,"Great bottles when used with nipples, terrible design with the sippy cup attachment. Valves are super tough to remove for cleaning, and they always are being cleaned. I recommend the First Years Clean & Simple, valve free! sippy cups. They don't offer them on Babies R Us online but the do have them in the store. They have them in 3 sizes , with handles and they don't leak! EVER! When making the purchase do it right the first time. Not like me 4 sets later :o("
1,Not the best,"I read all the Amazon reviews but still decided to go with the Avent sippy cup since I had relatively good experiences with the Avent bottles. Unfortunately, leaking is a real problem with these cups. Not only does the milk seem to pour out of the sides no matter how well I try to fasten the lid, but it does not flow easily for my son when he sips. He ends up with a mouth full of milk. So much for my efforts to get him to start using a cup. I orginally used Playtex and he liked that well enough. I only switched because the Playtex valve was hard to clean and easy to tear. Now, after wasting money on Avent, I'll go back to Playtex and hopefully my son will be willing to give sippy cups another try. I don't usually write Amazon reviews but I figured it was worth it in this case to save someone else the trouble. Unless you want milk EVERYWHERE, I would definitely avoid these cups."
3,Yes they DO leak!,"I do like the look of these cups and so does my son, but they do leak. I wish I had read the reviews before spending money on these cups. I don't know why they leak, but the milk somehow manages to end up on my son's clothes or on the floor almost all the time. I do agree that they are very cute, but NOT practical at all."
4,Very nice,"These are great. They work as described and are easy to assemble, disassemble and clean. I highly recommend AVENT bottles, it is all we use.The only reason this did not receive a 5 star is because I was not given the option to select the color. I received, pinkish/red bottles for my 1 year old boy. Not being able to pick the color, I was hoping that I would've received a gender neutral color."
5,excelent,"son hermosos, practicos, seguros para los niños, a las mamás les encanta porque tienen un producto de calidad para sus hijos"
1,Don't be fooled by a few good reviews,"These are a waste of money. They leak after the baby removes the cup from the mouth and soaks the clothes they are wearing. They do not leak when inverted making you think all is well. It is only after it is removed from the mouth. I called customer service and they were rude. They claim the cup is designed to expel any leftover liquid in the spout the baby does not drink. Someone please tell me how to explain to my baby how it should drink every drop in the spout. Yeah, right. These cups are the worst and customer service sucks. No rebate or refundat all."
1,These are the worst!,"Avent makes the best washable baby bottles around, so we felt that their sippy cups would be just as good. Well we were wrong. Of the five cups we had, all of them leaked and have since been thrown out. The cups are five different pieces vs other brands that use three pieces, which makes them harder to wash, harder to put together, and more pieces to lose. As far as sippy cups go, these are among the most expensive you can buy and worst that we used out five different brands. We have had great luck with Greber's and Playtex's. Please avoid!"
5,The Transition Was Easy.,"A little before our boy reached one year old, our pediatrician told us to gradually make the shift to more and more solid foods. The transition was easy. She also suggested that the boy should not be using nipples beyond the year one and we should gradually shift over to using sippy cups.We've used Avent bottles, for the most part, and have been very satisfied with them. As such, when the transition came we simply switched over to the Avent 9-ounce Magic Trainer. It took a little while, but the transition was easy and it's now the only bottle he uses. No problems. He picked up on the difference real fast.Gary Peterson"
3,Not the right colors.,I thought they would send the colors in the picture but instead I got blue and orange. They do leak some especially if the bottle is turned with the vent hole facing down while drinking.
1,Leaky,"I love Avent bottles, so I just went with these sippy cups out of brand loyalty. Thank goodness we only got two. One good thing is I think they are easy to clean. Now the bad stuff: They leak, as many others have commented, all the time. I only put water in it at this point, but it is still irritating to have a wet diaper bag whether it is water or juice or milk. The lid to cover the sippy part is really hard to get off. Also, the hole, which is probably a valve to get air in the sippy cup, is faulty in some way. My son always has water that spits up at him through that little hole. And if he drops it, tons of liquid comes out. Every kid drops stuff off of their high chair, so to not account for that in a sippy cup design isn't good. What are other options that have worked for people?"
1,Avent Leaks,I've heard Avent bottles leak but never experienced it myself. I just bought the toddler cups and 18mths spouts and BOTH link. Not just a littler either but with every use. My daughter can shake milk all over the house if she pleases. I find this odd b/c the 6mths cups don't link at all. I think these products are very hit or miss. You may get a leaky cup or you they may work great. ??
4,"Philips AVENT Hard Spout Magic Trainer with Handle, 9 Ounce, Twin",My 6 month baby boy loves his 9 Ounce Avent trainer cup also he is teething so he enjoys sucking the nipple.
2,Cups are hit or miss,"I agree with the review that suggests some cups leak and some don't. I purchased our first Avent magic sippy cup and was delighted to find it didn't leak at all. I then purchased a 2-pack of what I thought were the same exact cups. These leak all over the place! I can't see any difference in the exterior of the cup or the writing/logo. The only difference I see is when I remove the lid. There is no clear plastic piece in between the green plastic and the clear rubber disc, like there is in the first cup we purchased. I'm not sure if this is intended or some manufacturer defect. Maybe these cups are meant for older children? My suggestion is check the cup immediately after purchase and don't hesitate to return it if it leaks."
3,Good for SHORT TERM use only.,"I would recommend these for short-term use only, buying them with the thought in mind that you will one day throw them away because they wear out quickly and leak.If you plan on nursing and using Avent bottles, this is a great way to ""transition"" your tot into using a cup or another version of sippy cup (I recommend Playtex once your child has mastered holding a larger sippy cup- PLAYTEX WILL NEVER LEAK!). This Avent Magic Cup can be used with Avent nipples, etc.It is not the easiest to clean, but it is possible.Eventually, this Avent Magic Cup WILL leak."
2,Advent Magic Cups Aren't... (Magic that is),"This is not a horrible product. Some young children find the spout easier than other sippies, and we used it as a transition sippy before switching over to the Playtex model.They will leak, but hardly in floods if our experience is any indication. The BIGGEST drawback is that they are a real *pain* to clean. Very difficult to clean by hand (take something else on vacation!) and not all that convenient even when you do have a dishwasher at hand. There are just so many parts!Plus the handle and the ring thingie don't fit into our bottle washing dishwasher basket.Two stars. You might want to try it for an older baby or toddler who is not adapting to other styles. But otherwise give it a pass."
1,I doesnt work,"I bought it here in amazon with the Power Acoustik PTID-7002NR, I live outside of US and I payid the shippment, and the ipod doesnt work, I want to know if the will pay me back all that I spent just because they dont say that it doesnt work with all models... really bad...."
4,Good but slow to ship.,Took a long time for the item to be shipped but then received it quickly after that. Item was new as expected and works perfectly.
1,Worthless,It disables your iPod's controls and presents you with a much more limited set of controls and the info on display looks horrendous. It doesn't route the video in either.Just hook a 3.5mm headphone jack to RCA into the AV input instead and control it with controls that work. I bought the product and just don't use it because it's that bad.
5,Nice Sight!,I put this on my Marlin 336. Due to my aging eyesight I was having trouble using the factory sights. The peep allows me to pick up the red front ramp easily. I installed the rear sight myself but the front required me to take it to my local gun shop to tap out the old sight and put the new one on. I just didn't have the proper tools at home and it was only $5 to get it done.
1,Defective Product,I ordered this regulator and had it installed in Sept 2008. It broke in April of 2009.
5,An old friend...,"showed up in my mailbox today. I had this when it first dropped on lp & always loved it. Got the cassette because the cd is TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE! 'S ok cos I have a Tape player in my car so it's all good. Maybe when I get rich I'll buy the cd, but I'll have to wait because it's TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE! Great music, tho."
2,Razor Jr Electric Scooter,"My son is 3. Even though he is within the specified weight range, I thinks this product wasn't a good fit. We only had it for a week and it stopped working. I think this product is better for a younger child or a less coordinated child. He enjoyed it for the time he had it. The trouble seemed to come in when he tried to push it like a regular scooter."
1,We do not know,My daughter received the scooter for christmas. We open the scooter last week. It did not work. I am returning it tomorrow.
4,Lots of fun for the younger set!,"I bought this for my twin 2 1/2 year old daughters to share. Well, I had to buy another because there was no sharing this ride. It's easy for the kids to learn to use on their own but an adult MUST be present at all times when in use. We tried it out in the house first and they bumped into every piece of furniture in their way but after a few hours they got the hang of it and we brought it outside. They know they must wear helmets, knee and arm protection. Yes, this can be dangerous but with proper supervision, it's actually a lot of fun. We've only had it a week so I don't know how well it well hold up but I would have no qualms about returning it even after 6 months of use if I ran into a problem with durability or performance."
5,My 2 year old loves his Razor Jr.,"My 2 year old loves his Razor Jr. We got it for him for X-mas. We were worried he wouldn't be able to ride it, but he picked it up right away. It does get stuck when it is not on a flat surface, but it is light enough for him to pick it up and move it forward. I would really recomend it for toddlers."
1,Terrible!,This thing is extremely slow. Unless you are buying it for your one year old it is not worth it! The battery only lasted a few charges. My daughter had more fun with it while it had a dead battery.
3,super slow,"Got this for my 2 year old because he would constantly be a pain in the rear when his 6 and 11 year old siblings went to the park with their razor scooters. He thorougly enjoys it but I don't. Having to walk at a super slow pace is just not my thing being 5'11"". Its much easier having him walk but you can't get it away from him. Would recommend only if you're in the mood for walking 1mph."
5,Future Reggae Legend,"For all my fellow Reggae lovers, here is the album for you! Elan, has such an amazing reggae voice, which seems to channel greats like Eddy Grant, and even Bob Marley himself. Tony Kanal of No Doubt is a primary producer on this album, and his influence is definitely apparent. Another No Doubter featured on this album is Ms. Gwen Stefani herself, in the duet All Nighter. The unique blending of both Elan's and Gwen's voices captures a pure essence of all the greatness that is reggae. Elan is most definitely a pioneer of the Reggae world, already being featured on 50 1st Dates ( the cover of Slave To Love by Roxy Music, which also features a cameo by Gwen) and the Sex & The City ( Dreams Come True) soundtracks, which are just a beginning to his rise as a Reggae superstar."
5,soul swayin,This is one of my all time favorite CDs. I love reggae music and this is one of THE BEST. You will not regret this purchase. I love all the songs so I can't choose just one or two to mention here.
4,"good, but a little synthetic","I bought this after hearing ""Together as One"". However, nothing else on this cd is like that track. There are a 2 or 3 other tracks I like, but overall I think it has too much synthesizer for my taste in reggae. Dude has a great voice, a lot like Bob Marley."
3,Elan Better Live Than on this Studio Release,"Elan's captivating opening act set at the Chicago House of Blues for headliners UB40 this past summer was incredible. The crowd was mesmerized, most not having any idea that Elan had fronted the Wailer's Band for 3-plus years.(UB40 got the hint and played an extended stellar two-hour set just to prove they weren't about to be upstaged...)Most of Elan's material was a preview of ""Together As One.""The mix on this CD reminds me of Bunny Ruggs a la post-Third World more than Bob Marely or The Wailers Band.It might have capped the new debut album nicely to have included a ""live"" version of ""Get Up, Stand Up.""Elan has fantastic potential, all the elements are there.This CD needed to be less cooked, more raw, more stripped.Kick out the sound engineers next time and just roll analog!"
5,I wish I had River Cottage.,"This is a really cool story about a guy from London who decides to live the simple life. Choosing Dorset as his location, he stumbles upon a really cool cottage in the middle of the English Countryside. He sets up gardens and gets chickens and pigs. Each episode offers new challenges, and creative solutions."
3,More of a cooking show than anything else,"Was expecting more about life in the cottage, working the land, etc, but turns out every episode, so far, focuses more on cooking which bores me."
5,A spellbinding look at the war from the trenches,"A wonderful compililation of letters from an infantryman in an Iowa regiment. Sgt Clayton was involved in actions in Missouri, Louisiana, and Alabama, including a stint as a confederate prisoner. Narrative anb pictures by Dr. Elder really rounded this book out. Clayton was an excellent writer and gives incredible insight into army life and the fighting of the civil war. Best of all you get a flavor for the general perceptions of the common soldier, the ones charged with the dirty work.I thoroughly enjoyed this highly readable book, in fact resented any interruptions while trying to read it. Thank you, Dr. Elder!!"
3,Hard beyong your wildest imagination,THIS GAME IS TOO DAMN HARD! Or maybe it's because I'm not very good at strategy games like these. Anywho this game is very challenging. I bought this game and I thought this would be a bad-ass game right? Wrong! The campaignhs are extremely diffcult to pass and I just barely beat the first level of blue moon island. The only things that I like about this game are the scenario builder and the multi-player mode. If you like strategy games buy this. If not steer clear of it.
5,more like an expansion pack than sequel,"good game but not much different from the original.for a real sequel try the pc game M.A.X.part of the ""ultimate strategy archive"" by atari<..."
4,Advance Wars 2 for GAMEBOY ADVANCE,I bought it for my son who is 10 years old. He really likes the game but at times it gets a little boring in spots. It can be challenging at times and hard to get pastcertain levels. But overall he really likes this game.
5,best gba game,"this game is packed with tones of content. an amazing multiplayer mode that only requires one DS (take turns and pass the DS)which is super fun for gaming on the go with a friend. all in all i couldnt be happier, best 8 dollars ive ever spent"
5,The greatest handheldgame in AGES!,Does the title help discribe this game... I LOVE IT! it is the best game ever! Anyone who likes handhelds sould DEFINETLY BUY THIS GAME NOW. unfortunatly they do not make it so try and find it used somewhere I would suggjest gamestop or Game crazy
5,My best game,"If you have been given the chance to buy this game may I ask what you are waiting for?Hmmmmmm?Well...BUY IT NOW!I got this game when it came out,that was...when?Well anyway since then and now this has been my best game (sorry mario party) and I think it always will be.How do I like it?Well thats easy1vs2team battle (I'm on my own)my co: Grit1st com: Eagle2nd com: AdderMap: my design map 'jungle'weather: randomfunds: 2000My record: completed in 13 days (you should see my map!)Sorry about that anyway this game is good value and is a real head scratcher.Bye yall and bye bye Sturm HAHAHA!"
2,Not fun.,The single player missions are just god aweful and super unfair and the multiplay needs massive improvement.
5,i hate strategy games,"I usually hate strategy games. But one time i was at my friends house and we were really bored and i picked up his gba and advance wars 2 was inside. So i started playing it. I was hooked! i couldn't stop playing. Its npot extemely complicated like FF tactics and stuff like that. Its fun. Plus you can make your own map, buy new stuff, and theres a whole bunch of other awsome stuff that i havnt tried yet. But the campaighn mode alone is enough to give this gave a 5 out of 5. until then, game over."
5,Wonderful- A true Classic,This game was recommended by several of my friends. I had no idea what it was until I played it around eight times. I was instantly impressed. A wonderful game. I've beat it and Hard Mode on it. I've never seen anything like it. The four factions in the game could have better names though.
5,Advanced Wars 2 Black Hole Rising,I have only played this three times but just that can get you hooked to it. It is much better than the first one. If you have never played it borrow it from someone or buy it. You won't be mad.
4,How will you encourage your parents?,"Well. The game is great. THe first one is addictive. But if you are young well, is your parent caring for you not to get violent games? If you look at the cover you see Nami holding a bazooka. Is that not violent enough for you? Well here is how to encouage them:First, tell them that you enjoy this game.Second, look at the rating, it is E, which means it is recomended for ages 6+, most of you are.Third, tell them you will pay for it (optional)Fourth, express the popularity of the gameFifth, show them the game(use someone's else or sumthing)Last: If they didn't get through all of that then beg and forget it..."
5,The Best Strategy Game For GBA I've Ever Played,"This game is aewsome. You follow the mission objectives (usually destroy your opponent), build powerful armies, and conquer your world back. The map designer is a great feature in this game for you have almost no limits. The backround music is cool, the graphics are aewsome, and the different units are so unique.This is one of the few games you'll never get bored of."
4,Not bad.,"Not better than Xbox, and after November, isn't worth buyingReviewer: Nuckles87 from Spotsylvania, VA USANice lil console. Depends on your taste though. Personally, I liked it, but as I am more into action games and arcade-esque shooters, I've personally had more fun with the Xbox. Online game-wise, Xbox is by far a better deal, especially when True Fantasy Online, Halo 2, and Steel Battallion: Line of Contact arrives...But, putting online games aside, PS2 is an awsome deal. Has the best, and most, RPGs of any current console (other than the over bloated Final Fantasy franchise of course). But, like other consoles, PS2 isn't perfect. Buy it if you like platformers, traditional RPGs, or hardcore racers.-Nuckles87"
1,pack stinks but whant to make something clear!!,the pack might stink but for all you out there ps2 is better than xbox it has and will all ways..............ps bill gates made it because hes jelous!!! ps2#1!!!
5,Why Pay More?,"Based on the price I wasn't sure what to expect, but in the end I am very pleased with the purchase of this part! I ordered from National Auto Parts and paid 1/3 of the price as anywhere else online. Heck, I'm not even that mechanically inclined, yet I found info online, took the door apart, removed the window and old part and repaired it by myself. The part at a local parts place runs $150, plus, my mechanic said he would charge me $50 to install it (which is cheap). I paid $55 and the part was shipped to my door in less than a week. So sure it may have taken me a little over 2 hours, but in the long run, I saved at least $150."
3,Doesn't live up to its name,I was very disappointed when I ordered this along with two others along the same vein--I don't understand the criteria that was used to select the pieces for this CD. I do not recommend it to people who love classical music. I regret buying it.
4,Songs are good !,All songs are good from the 2 CDs.Only downside of the album is the sound volume is quite low so you have to turn up your volume setting a bit.
5,"The Buddy Rich Big Band ""Live"" WHAM!","This CD proves once and for all that Buddy is still the World's Greatest Drummer. The recording is superb, in stereo with excellent balance of sections. The crowning chart is Channel One Suite which is 26:23 (not the 18:00 listed) Buddy announces Channel with a 3 minute brush solo, caps it off with a technically perfect 5:45 snare & tom-tom solo ending with Buddy's typical crowd-raiser 3:41 conclusion. Rich fans, you must have this CD!"
3,I think they changed their formula,"I've been using this shampoo for years, but they must have changed their formula. I just don't like it as much as the last bottles. My hair is limper than it was."
4,"Nice product, poor packaging.",Arrived spilled. Nice shampoo with wonderful lavender scent. Glad to see larger sizes than available locally. Aggressive cleansing would not be suitable for dry or damaged hair.
3,Not-so-volumizing shampoo,"I didn't even want to finish the bottle, but I did give this a fair chance. This is an average shampoo, comparable to all other drug store shampoos. It lathers, it cleans. I still need a conditioner because it leaves my hair dry and tangled. There is a great rosemary scent, but I never got any of the 'volumizing' effects. I've had better and wouldn't purchase again."
5,Mmmm...Lemon,"Really nice shampoo that lathers well and doesn't dry out my hair or leave a residue feel. And it smells great, too :)"
3,"Ok, but not for dandruff","I tried Avalon's Tea Tree Scalp Treatment Shampoo because I'd developed a sensitive, itchy scalp with some flakes. I prefer using sulfate-free shampoo as I have color-treated hair & sulfates strip color.This is a decent shampoo, with pretty good lather for being sulfate free. It smells nice, & it does make my scalp feel a bit cool (literally), which I like. But even after a few weeks, the condition of my scalp hadn't improved. I'd say this is a good product for maintaining a healthy scalp & hair; but if you're really trying to heal an irritated scalp, it probably won't do the trick. Never thought I'd say this, but after much trial & error, I've ended up using the ol' classic H&S.; It (the H&S;) may have sulfates & other non-organic ingredients, but finally my head is back to feeling & looking normal."
4,Lemon Shampoo,The shampoo leaves a beautiful smell to your hair and has no artificial irritants or harsh ingredients. My only complaint is that the smell of lemon is very short-lived in your hair. It lasts no longer than the day you use it.
2,It's Okay,"I have used this shampoo for awhile now and I have to say that it's just okay. I am a wash and air dry girl, I rarely apply styling products. After using it for more than two washes in a row it tends to not do it's job so much, I'll still start to get build-up on my scalp along with dry hair and have to switch to another shampoo and conditioner, then come back to this. The smell however I find is very invigorating, and really wakes you up in the morning, it's also sulfate free which I find also to be a plus because I don't like to use a lot of chemicals on my hair. The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is very thick, and very moisturizing so much though that I cannot use it on my scalp I can only use it on my ends. When I use it on my scalp I appear to have oil build up by the end of the day. After I finish using what I have I doubt I'll ever buy the combination again."
1,Might as well put baby oil on your head and call it clean,"I USED to like this product but hadn't used it in a year or two. The latest bottle I bought said, ""New and improved with added essential oils"". Oil is right. I liked the first wash or two, and then one day washed my hair and immediately drove to the hairstylist to have it put in an updo. She remarked how flat and dull my hair was, and that I should have washed it that morning. Seriously? I realized after that day that it is the shampoo that is making my hair greasy, flat, and dull. TERRIBLE!"
2,ok but not great,Didn't lather as well as I would have liked and didn't leave much of a smell behind.
2,Wanted this to work but fell short,"I'm trying to avoid SLS (Sodium Laureth Sulfate) and was thrilled to find this product. It smelled so amazing and it wasn't due to artificial scents so that was a big plus, but it totally fell short as a shampoo. I expected that it wouldn't lather much, but it wasn't very easy to spread through my hair. I rinsed it really well until my hair ""squeaked"", but when it was dry YIKES it looked like it was mega dirty and lifeless. As though I hadn't washed it in days and it felt like it too. There was a greasy residue. I was SO disappointed I felt the need to rewash it to fix it and even after using another shampoo, it still wasn't 100% clean. I wanted to like this, but shampoo is supposed to make hair clean, not greasier."
3,Pretty good,"I haven't used product long enough to see any results. I like that you need only a very small amount of product. I don't like that after applying, the area feels sticky and stays that way."
2,Lemon Shampoo,"I was not happy with this shampoo, smells great but dried my hair out real bad even after using the conditioner."
1,"Great product, don't buy from this seller","I love this shampoo, which is gentle enough to use every day when I need to wash my hair too often because I've been working out on consecutive days. However, the style of the top opens easily, so it's not good for travel. Also, don't buy it from eSavvy -- they shipped it to me in a padded envelope, and the top partly opened inside the package, dumping about two ounces of shampoo. It's pretty obvious that it would leak if shipped like that. I'm out of this and it's hard to find locally, so I kept it, but I was pretty peeved."
3,Didn't help my scalp.,"I use to use Nature's Gate tea tree shampoo but decided to get a couple bottles of this when it was on sale. I was pretty excited because of the organic ingredients in it but it hasn't been helping my scalp. I suds up my hair and let the product 'sit' for a minute but I wasn't able to feel the 'tingliness' that I usually get from tea tree products. I wonder if I got older bottles. My scalp has gotten worst, but I wouldn't blame it all on the product. It's so many different factors, including: climate- humidity, water temperature, and stress that makes my scalp go crazy.I've finished the two bottles now, would not buy again."
1,do not recommend product,"i was really excited when i came across the organic haircare line since i am trying to use personal care products without parabens and other harmful chemicals, but i have been very disappointed with the effectiveness of the products. my hair has always been very thick, shiny and healthy and after a few months of using the lavendar shampoo and conditioner my scalp was dry and itchy and my ends became dry and brittle. at first i didn't attribute it to the shampoo but after going on vacation and using a different product for about a week i noticed a significant improvement- my hair looked much healthier. i have now switched or another organic shampoo (australian organics) and am much happier with the results.also, upon my initial recommendation my friend also bought the lavendar shampoo and had a similar experience- dry, brittle texture, so i know it wasn't just me....."
2,Not Avalon's Best Product,"I must start by saying that I really respect Avalon Organics as a company. I am a huge fan of their lavender hand & body lotion and I really like their ingredients.That said, I mounted an anti-SLS initiative after discovering that SLS is the reason my skin has looked so awful for so long. So Avalon's Lavender shampoo was the first thing I tried.For the first few days, it was wonderful. Smelled heavenly. My skin cleared right up! But by day 4, my hair had started looking dull, and two weeks in, I had a visible buildup on my brush as well as my hair.I had to do some amazing things to get the accumilated gunk off of my hair. And I had to switch to Giovanni's Non SLS products which immediately I noticed, do not leave a build up.So my two stars are for the beautiful scent and the fact that Avalon has other really fantastic products. But I can't recommend their non SLS shampoos-I hope they will try to address this and create one that works better at a later time."
3,leaky,This shampoo is a quality product. Never leaves residue on my hair. I have never gotten it through amazon though. It arrived a little leaky. That is my only complaint. I will probably try again because I like this shampoo and it is increasingly expensive in stores.
3,Invigorating,"Well, the smell is almost medicinal but it does do that invigorating tingly scalp feeling."
2,Be Careful With Shipping!,"This product does not have a little tin foil sealant under the cap. As a result, this shampoo can spill out. I had this shipped with a larger item and it spilled out all over the box. I lost a good portion of it. It's good shampoo, but I will not buy it through Amazon again unless they put a bit of tin foil under the cap to prevent spilling."
4,UNDERSTANDING NIEMEYER FROM A SURREALIST POINT OF VIEW,"NIEMEYER HAS BEEN HIGHLY CRITICIZED FOR POOR FUNCTIONALIST CONSIDERATION IN HIS BLDGS, SUCH AS HUMAN USE. MANY OF THIS ACCUSATIONS MAY BE TRUE. BUT THIS BOOK OFFERS AN ANALYSIS OF THE ARCHITECT'S WORK FROM A SURREALIST POINT OF VIEW, THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHERE HE COMES FROM AND WHY THE FREE-FORMS ARE ALMOST AN OBSTINATE CONSTANT IN HIS WORK TO THIS DAY. IT'S INTERSTING TO READ UNDERWOOD'S THESIS, AS JUST ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING AND STUDYING THE WORK OF THIS MASTER OF BRAZILIAN ARCHITECTURE."
5,christy,I have 1-11 of the Christy videos..#1-3 in spanish...I love them and would like to know how many are in spanish and how many videos are there total? Does christy marry? who? #11 did not show who she decided to marry. I would LOVE to know! Thanks!
1,guitar,"Broke faster than expected! Not for the 'real' player.. cheaply made TOY. Note: if you do buy this, DON'T throw any of the packaging away. There is a small pc of balsa wood that you need, that can easily fall off of it and be lost forever."
3,Woodstock guitar,"Though the durability isn't the greatest with this product (the brige is a moveable, poorly made piece of particle board), my niece loved it. And it has pretty good sound, too!"
1,Very unhappy with purchase!,"All but three strings were broke, I feel like I wasted my money.My daughter was very disappointed with the gift and so am I."
5,gift for friend,great value. a little too small. had to buy a bigger one. oh well. it was still a bargain. hooray.
3,fun junk,"This guitar is cheap and poor quality. Two strings broke while I tried to tune it, the bridge constantly comes unglued. But my two-year old loves it because it makes noise and he feels like a rock star. Which is why we bought it. Don't expect to be able to teach a child anything on this guitar...but I'd buy it again for a two-year-old to wail on."
1,my worst online purchase,"this is the biggest piece of junk i've ever purchased on the internet. the strings have two states: loose or broken. the part that raises the strings off the face of the guitar is a piece of balsa wood just put there in place, held by the weight of the strings. once you break a string it starts to just move around or fall off.i would pay [....] for this at a convenience store if i needed something comedic to smash."
1,Very Dissatisfies,With 4 days before Christmas we were going to tighten the strings and make sure the guitar was ready for our 3 1/2 year old who loves guitars so much. We are disgusted with the quality. The strings don't tighten so 3 of the 6 are so loose the wooden piece at the bottom keeps falling out. For some reason the nobs dont catch when we twist them. I am very disapointed and upset with this guitar. I would not have wasted my money on it had I known how poorly made it is.
2,Kids fantasy Guitar,"Woodstock Percussion Kid's Fantasy GuitarVery disappointed in this product. Although the guitar itself looks like a real guitar, the strings are very loose and flimsy. In fact, in order to make any sound, we had to remove one string. I would not recommend this purchase"
1,"Awful, awful toy!!","We received this guitar, took it out of the box and tuned it. My husband majored in music in college and is currently a working musician, so he knows what he's doing. As soon as he tuned it, the neck and back separated from the body! My son never even got to hold it. He cried so hard while we packed it up to return. It was heartbreaking. We went to the chain toy store and purchased a first act guitar for 6 dollars more. Much better! Don't risk the heartbreak!"
4,"A little pricey, but accurate and resistant","The Suunto X9 GPS watch is acurate as well as resistant to change in environment and p.h. level. I went around the whole house noting how the coordinates changed and recorded certain corners of the house. Perhaps I went a little too far, but I double-checked the location several time and was pleasantly surprised with a constant, unchanging location in the spots that I recorded. Even after my dog ate the watch and pretty much digested the whole thing, after about three days I was able see how durable this particular piece of material was. The main piece of the watch still functioned and STILL displayed the proper locations that I had recorder earlier. I'm not going to wear it anymore, but my nephew thought it was a cool watch after I replaced the band and gave it to him for his birthday."
3,Davis Cup Year book - centennial year,"For this book to cover the 100th Anniversary of the Davis cup, it was a mediocre. It should have been special not only because of its importance to tennis but for the memories of the fans and players. Some of the pictures are of poor quality and are not as clear, crisp and sharp as were pictures from previous yearbooks. The review of each round was average to weak. The only redeeming quality was the foreword by Patrick Rafter where he describes what it is like to play in Davis Cup tournaments. Outside of that, the book offers very little."
2,Fallible Consistency Theory,"Well, unfortunatley this is all the Australian music industry is willing to offer in Oz hip-hop. Melbourne is the home of many great musical forrays, which include all genres that are encompassed on this album. But all we receive in the public mainstream is this group who can only bragg and boast on boring and irrelevant b.s. I don't mean to sound to harsh, b/c there is some good tight production and a an inclusion of ethics which scratch the surfice of socialist dynamics. I think those who have heard the album have nothing new or inspiring inserted into their memory bank. We simply want better. We know its out there."
2,Big tweeters,"So i have a 93 ford ranger which only comes with two stock door speakers. I recently added 3 12's in the back, and found myself really needing some mid range speakers.I have a limited amount of space so i figured some 6x9's would do the trick.....So i hooked them up; and well lets just say my stock 5inch door speakers have more mid range than these 6x9's, although the highs are really good in these speakers.It seems like a lot of wasted space for some tweeters so ill have to figure out a new solution.For Anyone that says these speakers bump must have got bumped on the head. For one these are high to mid range speakers.... They don't bump. I never expected them to, but was hoping that the reviews would at least be lead to a accurate mid range speaker.I bought these speakers used for 15 bucks so i don't feel bad about the deal, just wished for more lol"
4,GOOD STUFF EVER WITHOUT HURTING YOUR WALLET!!!!,"SOUNDS GREAT AND PLAYs GREAT in ANY CAR STOCK DECK PLEASE CHECK UR MAKE AND MODEL AND YEAR, GREAT FOR QUICKly GETting UR MUSIC PUMPING in your car PUMP UP D MUSIC BRO.!!! BUT HOWEVER MY ADVICE to u is THEIR R BETTER, MORE POWER MORE MONEY MY MAN!! or GIRL< AND YES RMS AND WATT DOES MATTER, they come hand in hand do your reseach on google shopping speaker alway get a pair and same brand for all your speakerSGOOD STUFF EVER WITHOUT HURTING YOUR WALLET!!!! sound grest PERIOD!!!!however thier r better out their???"
2,What a waste,I recently bought these for my car and installed them. Installation was easy and the hardware was perfect. These speakers do NOT bump. I turned the bass all the way up and they sound horrible. They really aren't good at any range and I have 280 watts going to each. Also the description is very misleading. It says that they have a 40 is magnet when in reality it is a 30 oz. False advertising and horrible product. I will be buying nothing but name brand from now on. Only good thing is the shipping was great and free!
2,Poor quality,I expected a better quality product for the price I paid for this item. It comes in a very cheap container that does not hold the contents securely. Appears to be made from cardboard. Very poor quality. The brush hairs are already coming out and it hasen't even been used yet. It was also packaged poorly and arrived soaking wet. The paper that comes along with this product was also poor quality.
2,Pretty to look at,This large calligraphy set box is beautiful. The red and gold brocade is glued very tightly and neatly around the gray pasteboard frame. The plastic toggles almost resemble bone or ivory toggles. The box is provided with weights of various shapes to prevent breezes from causing accidents.
5,Wonderful!,This documentary is utterly fascinating and exciting! I love hearing the accounts from the engineers. I wish they had made more episodes.
2,The Boeing Company not mentioned in the Saturn V segment,"The first segment, the Saturn V first stage, does not mention one word that it was the Boeing company that designed, manufactured, tested and delivered 20 vehicles to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. All of this engineering work was done in the subburbs of New Orleans and not Huntsville, Alabama. This DVD is recording history and it is sad that the Boeing company does not get any credit for designing and building the most powerful rocket ever built."
1,Does not work - defective disc,"Had to return it. No scratches on the disc. But it kept freezing and jumping to random sections. It did this in 3 players, all of which work fine with other discs."
1,Moon Machines?,"I Believe in Fake Moon Landings, so I won't be buying this DVD. I hope you all enjoy it. This DVD is a Fantasy."
5,Very nice,The unit was marked as refurbished but it looks to be brand new. Not a mark on it. It works great. Very powerful. Long hose. Handle folds down for storage or transporting. I would purchase it again.
4,Eiken the manga fares better than Eiken the anime . . .,"While I did not care much for the Eiken anime that came out a couple of years ago, the manga is much better and even tries to tell a story. All of you favorite over-developed Eiken club members are back along with hapless Densuke. My favorite chapter in this volume has to due with the club's accident prone adviser/teacher trying to cook a meal for the club. Very funny stuff, but most defiantly for the 18+ manga readers out there . . . ."
5,Fantastic,"Another great volume of Eiken! There's a lot of good comedy and fanservice. If you've been following the series so far, be sure to get this one! It's full of sexy girls."
1,If only I could give this the negative score it deserves.,"As a nursing student who is finishing up her thesis on education of children with chronic illness, I find this book utterly tasteless and harmful. How can people justify child abuse through religion? Tripp shouldn't be allowed near children with these absurd ideas.p.114 Tripp answers the concern of a parent: ""I'm afraid of being arrested for child abuse."" This is his answer: ""There is validity to this concern. You must be careful to avoid unnecessary exposure to being reported by someone who does not approve of spanking. Spanking should be done in the privacy of the home."" - Doesn't this passage alone point out a major error? Tripp clearly shows he knows he's doing something illegal. If he wasn't, why else would he hide it?Do yourselves a favour and find a book that is actually promoting child health, not child abuse. I beg you people, love your children, don't hate them like this!"
4,Great book for new parents - Great advice on addressing root cause of behavior,"I recommend that parents read this book and extract information which they feel can be helpful in their parenting approach. The main focus isn't bullying and spanking your children. The main focus is learning how to communicate and understand your children to help prepare them for their life in this world. From my experiences, I have seen firsthand the benefits of using communication and discipline.The negative reviews of these book are taking and assuming the principles to extremes. Anything taken to extremes can be dangerous.I recommend that parents read this book to understand the benefits from using communication and discipline to raise their children."
1,OH KAMI,"OMG that was just as awful as that babist one i just read ""were you shove a sock into the chids mouth"" they call 'em deamons and beat them then though them to the side for not eating veggies. i believe in a good bum warming if a child is naughty but some of these pple are just FREAKS, i am glad you posted this, that book is just so wrong, now im not cristian or nothing im a Buddist but i believe that both lords are one in some ways and God doesn't think of childeren as heathens i don't know who came up with this stuff ""probably some simple minded fool"" but beating a infant that is just disgusting, this book should be off stores! all if follows to is child abuse and it is inhumaini do hope this was on the subject if not then 'gomen' and domo for posting~Mizuki-chani didn't know how to rate sorry"
1,Biblical Perversion,"Raise your child according to this book and you'll be almost guaranteed to have a child whose character will be either angry and resentful, fearful and ashamed, or judgemental and punitive. What kind of whip would Jesus use?"
1,disappointed!,This book is described as a loving guide for parents to get closer to a child's heart. After reading it I found it to be nothing more than a how to book for whipping children and babies. Very disturbing!
1,A Book For the Garbage,"This book is a guide to help your child hate, rather than love God. I can't believe this kind of trash is being published in the name of ""Christian"" childrearing. Treat your child in the manner this book recommends, and I can assure you that a therapist will hear all about you someday in your child's counseling sessions. The writer even advises parents to hide these disciplinary measures from the public. That's because they are illegal. The methods advised are classified as abuse by law.There are so many good books out there on Christian discipline for parents. Why would anyone want to follow the kind of unacceptabgle guidelines this book advises?"
5,May favorite parenting book!,This is a must for parents!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Totally changed my thinking. Gave me total peace in disciplining. Now I can calmly and confidently parent with a perfect goal everytime. I wish every parent was required to read this book! I give it as gifts to new parents all the time.
1,This Shouldn't Be Legal In A Civilized Country,"This book is the most disgusting mix of pedophillia and child abuse that I have ever had the misfurtune to see outside of a criminal trial. It combines the worst of a Dark Ages mindset that all children are evil terrorists with modern-day torture. This book advocates hitting babies as soon as they are brought home from the hospital! The things described in this book would be illegal if used on an animal, but somehow the author feels that perents should use them on their own children. It made me sick just reading it. Please, please don't buy this abuse manual."
1,Spanking an infant is just wrong and a lazy parent,"I can't believe this man believes the only way to discipline is to spank. Then he and his wife are so lazy that they couldn't be bothered to set up a perimeter around dangerous areas in their house so they spank an eight month old who entered the forbidden zone (pg. 154 1995 ed). I believe in spanking but to spank an infant is gutwrenching, especially seeing is how I witnessed Mr. Tripps advice being carried out."
2,disappointing read,"I was a part of a community group of parents of young children who studied this book. Frankly I found it poorly written with badly supported points. I was hoping for more application as well. Overall I found it uninspirational and a poor guide to parenting. Interestingly I got more applicable information on parenting out of Paul Tripp's book on marriage (What Did You Expect?) because it applies to ALL relationships in your life and changed how I related to both my spouse, children and others in such a positive way."
5,Shepherding a Child's Heart,"This book was recommended to me by a dear friend and while all my children have grandchildren, I have purchased it for a Christmas gift to my grandchild who is starting her own family."
1,Horrible author,"This author promotes violence in children all shrouded by plattitudes of spiritual warnings that if you don't control your kids by every means possible, they will rebel and never follow God. Preposterous! There are effective alternatives to spanking and punative parenting in general and they can be carried out in the most Christlike of homes. Dr. Sears is a great resource to start with."
1,Pick a Different Book,"What Tedd Tripp has to say may be true, but he says it without warmth, humor or compassion. If you're looking for a good book on parenting from a Christian perspective, pick up a book by Dr. James Dobson, Dr. Kevin Leman, or Gary Chapman."
1,How would I feel if I saw my little girl,"A description given speaks of the authors little girl playing with her dolly, and saying, you did...... wrong,now mommy must spank you, and then she spanks her dolly.If I saw this as a parent I would cringe. I want to see my child take her baby dolly and love her and cuddle her and feed her and change her diaper. You know, tenderness? Unconditional Love? Respect?I just didn't see it in this book."
1,Perversion of God's blessed teaching,"A short review for an evil work. This is NOT what Sacred Scripture teaches. It is a perversion that should remind the reader of Jesus' admonition to his followers: Whoever scandalizes one of these least ones who do better to tie a millstone around his neck and cast himself into the sea. God is love. Not hard love. Divine love. Violence is laziness and hatred personafied. If you feel good after beating someone smaller than you, then you should count yourself amongst those who should be sizing themselves for a millstone."
1,Foundation misguided,"The author of this book is clearly a man who loves the Lord and loves his children. However, a reader/potential reader should ""get a second opinion"" before accepting at face value statements such as ""In these early years of childhood, the rod is primary...because God has commanded it.""(Page 148) The second opinion could come from a Hebrew scholar regarding the fact that the word translated ""child"" in the quoted passages from Proverbs would be more accurately rendered ""youth,"" or one might consult another Bible-based book by a committed evangelical, Heartfelt Discipline by Clay Clarkson."
4,Proverbs 22:6,"Before my wife and I added a couple of girls to our clan, we read a few books that offered us advice on how to be good parents. One of those books was Shepherding a Child's Heart. This book is about speaking to the heart of your child. So often we are focused on the outward behavior of a child, but there is a heart issue that needs to be addressed. At times I felt the parent/child scenarios in Shepherding a Child's Heart were a little rigid and that Tripp was very absolute in his thinking, but overall I benefited from reading Shepherding a Child's Heart. This conservative book has not only helped me as a parent, but it also made me rethink how I approach discipline with my students. If you strongly oppose spanking, you will probably dislike this book (and my review) a great deal. If that is the case, we might have a heart issue folks. :-)"
1,Repeat,I feel like it was the same concepts over and over. I do agree that Christ should be the head of the home but I don't think he meant for your child to be spanked for every little thing. Which is how it seemed this book was wrote
1,sick & sad: promotes child abuse,"i don't understand the adoration of this book! while it does address that obedience is not the primary issue (as so many other books do), and focuses on the need to focus on the heart of your child, it misses the mark in a huge way. from endorsing the beating of infants, to a warped view of children in general, from weird theology regarding the role of parents, to the utterly bizarre abusive bare bottom spankings that a small child is to endure without anger or upset, this book is a manual for child abuse and little more. i'm shocked this book is not only sold all over the place, but is given by church leaders to parents upon the births of their children! our children should be given the same respect and mercy that we give to other believers, should be won through love and patience and kindness, not through bullying and beatings."
1,Handbook for child abusers,"The book should be entitled ""Beating A Child's Heart into Submission."" This man manipulates the teachings of Christ to promote child abuses. He teaches ruthlessness in the rearing of children. He advises parents to be merciless when dealing with children. He claims that if a child exhibits any resistance to your wishes s/he must be beat or you as a parent are failing to do God's will. His parenting techniques are dangerous, damaging to children and totally inconstant with what accredited studies tell us about child development."
1,abusive drivel,"OMG . This is the most shocking thing ive ever seen.A LICENCE FOR CHILD ABUSE ....Under the guise of ""god fearing christians"". DISGUSTING , SICK , DEPRAVED AND EVIL.Encouragement to physically hit and abuse children ,even infants, babies at months old.I hope hell has a special place for the author , who if there is any justice, will be slow roasted and disaplined as he describes in the book.No good person would ever harm a child.NOTICE HOW IT IS ALSO PUBLISHED BY THE AUTHOR ..... SURE SIGN THAT ITS NOT WORTH READING ! ."
2,"Good ideas, bad interpretation of Scripture","I think that Tripp would have done a better job with this book if he hadn't touted his opinion about spanking as being a MANDATE of God! I'd love to know where Tripp got that madate from, because I couldn't find it and neither could our pastor--and I attend a devout Bible preaching church. I'd recommend choosing another book altogether, but if you can put that aside, his information about teachable moments is good."
1,Should be Crushing a Child's Heart,"If you are looking to raise secure, confident children, DO NOT buy this book. The recurring theme of this book is that children, even small infants, are tyrants with terrible agendas that we must crush. Ugh! It advocates whipping small children and hiding it from others to avoid repercussions. The book constantly refers to young children in negative terms and advises parents to break their spirit in the name of religion. It is sickening. I want to parent my children to be loving, non-violent people and if you want the same, do not use the methods in this atrocity."
4,Good Christian-based Parenting Guide,"I just finished reading this book, and I found it very worthwhile and valuable to parenting children in a Christian household. The reference to parenting teenagers was spot-on. Now, with regard to spanking, if you follow Dr. Tripp's process and spank out of consequence (not out of anger or emotional reaction), then it is relevant and appropriate. Spanking has become so controversial in our society, yet, it does require consideration as effective punishment. For some children, they naturally want to please, and spanking is not appropriate. For others, it takes spanking to bring them into alignment with what God wants in each of us, which is loving obedience. Certainly, read and re-read Dr. Tripp's advice on spanking and the steps regarding it."
5,Not a fix kids quick book,"If you want to read a book that will help you lead your children into a relationship with Christ through your obedience in training them properly, then this is the book for you. I have found that the best parenting tips are those that bring my lack of faith and obedience to my attention. How can I expect my children to obey me when I don't obey my father in heaven? This book teaches a lifestyle of training. Training your children in the way they should go - obedence to their creator. Tedd Tripp speaks clearly and his guidence is very Biblical. However, beware you will not change your children over night. In using Mr. Tripps biblical teaching I have noticed my children's hearts change toward me and their God. It is a blessing to see. It only encourages me to continue on this path. This is a great book. I have copies in paperback and CD. When I see that I am being lazy in my parenting I just put in a CD and I am reminded of my duty as a parent, to shepherd my child's heart."
5,Terrific,"This is a great, biblically sound book. Other parenting books are full of tricks. This book is full of the Bible. If that's not what you are looking for, this book is not for you."
5,"Great for my sensative, strong-willed child.","If you read the book CAREFULLY you will understand what his point is. This book is not advocating ""hitting your child"" but to calmly communicate with your child before and after a discipline. Never in anger or striking out at her. It is very logical, EVEN TO THE CHILD. This has been the only answer for my highly intellegent, strong-willed, sensative 3 1/2 year-old. Timeouts, soap in the mouth, etc., were torment, producing anger. This has been a God-send and a peace-keeper."
1,One word: Scary,"The book made some good points but to put forth a ""one size fits all"" parenting philosophy is irresponsible and dangerous. A completely literal translation of Proverbs in order to justify consistent physical punishment for all children of all ages, is also ludicrous. I was very disappointed. To Christian parents: My suggestion would be to seek God's wisdom rather than Ted Tripp's interpretation of God's wisdom."
2,A comment,I have read a few reviews that others have made and one thing I agree on is that the book is very receptive. Like a pastor preaching and saying the same thing over and over again.Another thing I wanted to mention is that the author uses his family a lot as examples of what they did and how they did things. Maybe it's just me but it seems to come across as arrogant. It's a turn off for me. Kind of like a pastor preaching and all his illustrations have to do with his family. I love to see authors/preachers highlight what they see others doing well and not using mostly themselves as examples.
1,Lord help us,"Go ahead. Spank your kids so that they begin to hate you and ultimately the Lord. This is an epidemic. Kids grow up believing in violence, hate and aggression towards others. You want to use yor time wisely? Read ""Spare the Child"" by Philip Greven.Proverbs 13:24 He who spares the rod hates his son, but he who loves him is careful to discipline him.Because of this verse, millions of kids have been physically abused. Most people think that the ""Rod"" is a stick, belt, paddle or something physical. Think about this: Could the rod be spiritual? Can you discipline your children with love, care, encouraging words, non humilifying consequences, truth, courage and by your own example? Where did Jesus tell us to beat our kids up? Would Jesus get a paddle to beat Tedd Tripps behind? He may want to, but He won't. You know why? Because He loves Tedd a great deal.P.S. Tedd. Better get that millstone off from your neck buddy!"
1,Not what Jesus would do,"This is another book that plays to Christians to support hurting children's self esteem and their bodies. Tripp uses a lot of Old Testament to support his theories. Don't spend your money here. Buy one that is based on research and/or a christian based book that advocates being a good role model such as:Dr. Teresa Whitehurst's book, ""Jesus on Parenting: 10 Essential Principles that Will Transform Your Family"". I personally have not read it but I have read some other stuff from her and it was good reading. William Sears, Spock, and Brazelton are my personal favorites of parenting books"
1,wish i could give this book negative -1,"As a new mom AND a Christian, I bought this book after our church recommended it during our parenting class. However, after receiving it and finding the chapter on spanking, I was apalled. I can never imagine including spanking in our regular discipline routine, and I don't think I am less of a Christian for it! That would feel so wrong to me. There are many statements in the Bible especially the Old Testament that we could take literally, but for me, this is one that I will choose not to take literally. Just as I do not believe a man should hit his wife for doing wrong, I certainly don't believe we should hit our children for doing wrong in order to ""teach"" them something. I don't want my child to fear or feel physical pain from my hand. (And I am a Christian and love God, but I don't think ALL Christians have to spank their children.) I couldn't stand having this book in my home so I returned it."
1,"Received as a gag gift. I read it, and gagged.","I found the experience horrifying. I was prepared for a ""Fundamentalist"" outlook, but I found it to be far more ""mental"" than fun.How can a man advocate violence against children as young as eight months old and not be in prison? Dress it up as ""biblical"" teaching."
1,"Jesus, don't let Mommy hurt me, Please...","In this day in age, living in the World that we do, finding guidance appropriate for the Christian home is truley a blessing.However, it is books like this one written by Mr. Tripp who turn mothers and fathers alike against the Church and God. This book will give you 2 things; (1) nightmares; (2) deeply emotionally challenged children. And I won't even go into his little story about beating an 8mo child.Be forewarned folks: While God may tell you to whip your child into fear, he tells me to call the Police when I see someone beating their kids.This book takes Christian fundamentals and turns them into ""religious beliefs"" protection clauses to evade Child Abuse charges.I'm sorry Mr Tripp, I gave your book a shot, but perhaps that's just what you need...to be shot."
1,Promotes Child Abuse...,"Just like the bible, this book is full of hypocrisy, in that perfect love is contradicted with violence being okay. Reading the bible LITERALLY causes people to fear God much like an abuse victim loves their abuser out of fear. Tell me, just how is love casting out all fear when the people who love you fear you? You can't have it both ways.I'm appalled that Amazon is selling such books and perhaps until they quit selling books that promote 'covered' child abuse, Amazon will not be getting my business any longer.Anyone who reads and promotes this book should really learn how to weed out any message in this book, others like it and the Bible that contradict with the message of love.Sandy W"
4,Shepherding a Child's Heart,"This is a useful and encouraging. However, the only part I don't like is the author will say you need to do this or that to train a child but it does not explain how to go about helping your child or presenting a solution to the problem. Just wish it would give helpful examples and tools."
1,Not Worthy of One Star,"This book is NOT what should be used to guide a parent in raising children. While Tripp does discuss scripture... he seems to think the only way to discipline children is to beat up on them! That is NOT what the Bible says! Tripp may believe that a person should discipline with physical punishment... but what does that teach our children? To hit, fight, and that the people who are supposed to love them are also required to beat them??? This is not the lesson I want my child to learn!As an alternative, I would recommend reading Grace based Parenting, by Dr. Tim Kimmel. Dr. Kimmel's book is wonderful!"
5,Easy and excellent read,"As I made my way through the pages, I could see how I was using some of these concepts with our two boys already and how I could be a much better father to my kids. There is a lot of valuable information in these pages that I will look back on as my kids grow up."
2,Pretty Disappointed,"I was hoping for so much more from this book. There are little bits of wisdom, but otherwise, I think it's too harsh. I definitely got the vibe of what personality Tripp is--and it isn't mine. I have seen kids grow up who were treated in the way he suggests--and it isn't good. I'm not anti-spanking, but I sure am not for it on the level he instructs. I just think there is more of a balance in parenting. I wouldn't reccommend this book. There are better Christian approaches that are more loving without being too permissive. sure, we are responsible to God to train our kids to respect and obey Him, but I sure am not going to say that God wants me to discipline by spanking. I'm fallible. I want my kids to know that God is happy when they behave and obey and that he loves and forgives them when they don't."
5,THE most biblical parenting resourse,"This book is solidly biblical, based on sound exegesis of the scriptures. The video series for small group study is also excellent.I have read EVERY SINGLE negative review on this page, and absolutely without exception, every one has severely misrepresented or totally misunderstood the contents of this book. These people have forsaken God's Word, and chosen to follow the vain philosophies of men instead---secular humanism in particular. It's too bad they can't call it what it is. I can only assume that they have never bothered to crack open a bible and seriously study."
1,Was King Solomon a model parent?,"Is that what's really written in Proverbs? Or does it say that Solomon's parenting left a bit to be desired?This book is based primarily on one snippet from the Old Testament - spare the rod, spoil the child - and ignores all that we've learned about child development since Solomon's time.It's difficult to imagine in what setting Christ would support the author's demand that faithful parents must inflict physical pain on very young children (8 months is the number Mr Tripp mentions) Pass on this one!"
1,This Is Not True Christian Teachings,"The people that advocate hitting children in the name of our Lord seem to have forgotton there is a New Testament. We are supposed to discipline and correct our children, these are teaching methods...hitting is violence. Jesus came to teach us a kinder, gentler way and He would NEVER hit a child. The only reason people resort to hitting is because that's what they have been taught by uninformed, uneducated in the true way people or because they simply don't know what else to do."
1,Don't buy this,"This book was highly recommended and so our christian Mom's group chose to read this. The basic idea could have been summed up in a simple brochure, the rest belonged in the garbage where our books ended up! Tim Kimmel's Grace Based Parenting is so much better, more loving, more practical. I hope others choose Tim Kimmel's book instead of Tedd Tripp's!"
5,Should be required reading for EVERY parent,"Tedd Tripp masterfully lays out a plan for getting to the heart of a child's behavior. He shows how it isn't good enough to just get children to behave when people are looking, but that the child needs to see that they are a child of God and that they are part of a bigger picture than themselves. He points out that behavior is merely a symptom of what is going on in their hearts. If you can shepherd the child's heart, their behavior will follow. Well done! Wish I had had this book prior to my son's birth."
1,"Should be called ""Breaking a Child's Heart.""","While he starts off with a few good ideas, he misinterprets Scripture saying that we MUST hit (spank) our children in order to obey God. Then he advocates hitting infants who are waaaay too young to understand why they're being hit. Also, he says to repeat spankings if the child shows any negative emotions about the spanking. Does this sound Christian to you? As an early childhood professional AND a devout Christian, I cannot recommend this book to parents or churches! There are plenty of biblically accurate child rearing books such as ""How Would Jesus Raise Your Child"" by Teresa Whitehurst, ""Biblical Parenting"" by Crystal Lutton, ""Thy Rod and Thy Staff They Comfort Me"" by Samuel Martin, ""Spare the Rod"" by Phil E. Quinn, and anything by Dr. William Sears that teach how to raise children in Christ without violence! This book is NOT one of them!"
5,"A Sound, Biblical Approach","This is a book that gets to the heart of what parents really want for their children - we want them to grow up to be men and women of character and conviction. Mr. Tripp helps parents understand that conforming a child's behaviour is an inadequate approach to parenting. What Christian parents should be seeking is to help our children understand that obedience is tied to the character of God.Why should a any child obey their parent? Because the parents wants it that way? Because the parent is bigger? Because it is embarrassing if they don't? No, it is because that is how God designed it.Now as for spanking. Tripp points out the fact that careful and controlled use of spanking is both biblical and effective. He does a great job of qualifying when it is and is not appropriate. He also is very clear on the context of when it is appropriate to spank. Spanking is a relatively minor aspect of what he covers and he covers the topic carefully, respectfully and biblically."
5,Excellent Book,Tripp does an excellent job of incorporating matters of the heart with discipline. If you're looking for a PC method of child rearing or desire to produce a Britney Spears...then this is not your book!
1,Rubbish,dont waste your money - this man is supporting and inducing child abuse. 'Spanking' and 8month old baby................what sicko does that?
1,A Violent Way to Raise a Child,"I was horrified by this book. I am a Christian who does believe in spanking, but only when all other forms of discipline have failed. The ""rod"" in the Bible does not necessarily mean ""something to spank your child with."" I've always thought of it as another word for discipline or correction. Tripp advocates spanking an 8 month old baby. If you do this, all your child will know is that Mommy(or Daddy) hurts her. I agree with other reviewers that spanking for every offense is a lazy way to parent. I do not agree with their outrage over children being sinful from conception. That is clearly stated in the Bible a number of times. If you are looking for good ideas on correcting your children, I suggest you check out ""Creative Correction"" by Lisa Whelchel. She has a lot of good, non-violent, ways to shepherd your child's heart."
1,Not the answer,"I am a Christian Mom, who felt mislead by the title of this book. Please DO NOT BUY this book. Instead I would get,The Complete Book of Christian Parenting & Child Care: A Medical & Moral Guide to Raising Happy, Healthy Children, by William and Martha Sears."
1,Don't hit kids!,"This book is so bad, it says to hit babies and kids all the time. Babies don't know what they're doing, they should never be hit. And kids need someone to listen and talk with them about life. If you hit them they will hate you. I don't believe Jesus wanted parents to hit their babies! That is just crazy."
1,False advertisement,I did not receive what I ordered. The book pictured is a revised edition (which is what I wanted) I received a 2005 version with a different cover. This is false advertisement and it should be specified on the order that they are giving you an out of print and older version.
1,I hate this book,Every parent I have met who used this system had very little control over their children. This is especially true for those who started using this book from a young age. I have read it myself and found the general principles helpful but to impliment these principles across the board with no appplication of your own reasoning or common sense in a situation is disastrous. I am truly concerned for the safety of some children that I have seen raised under this book. Their understanding of authority is weak and their behavior is constantly right on the edge to the point that they become unruly and unpleasant to be near.
3,Nothing groundbreaking,"How to raise a disciplined child from a Christian perspective. The author emphasizes the need for parents need to address a child's ""heart"", making him aware and respectful of his personal relationship with God, and the role of his parents in that relationship. While I agree with many of the points laid out by the author (which should be nothing groundbreaking among Christian circles), I find somewhat disturbing his strong advocacy of corporal punishment as a first-line of defense against disciplinary problems, rather than as a last resort. I guess I lean more towards selective moderation."
1,Another terrible book,"This is another poor excuse for a parenting book. Again, yet another book which clearly tries to promote child abuse. The author should be ashamed to have written this. It has not place in our society!"
1,How to get your rocks off in one easy lesson,"Well, that seems to be what Le Tripp is after. Don't be sucked in. His methods are illegal in this country anyway, so don't bother."
4,A Good Read for loving Parents,"What a great book to give as a baby shower gift.Every loving parent should give this book their time. Young as well as mature parents will be enlightened by the biblical principles shared in this ""easy to read"", book. It gives good understanding to the call of ""parenthood"". I'm hoping to have a bible study group with the young mom's of our church using this book with the bible as a guide.I love doing business with Amazon, I will continue to order products from them."
5,"Soft, fluffy towels.",Towels arrived on time. Very durable. They get fluffier the more you wash them....and they are HUGE! Love em!
4,"Great towels, terrible delivery","I read the reviews and was prepared for this when it happened... I ordered two towels of different sizes, both gave 5-10 day shipping times, the first arrived in 6 days, the second about 3 weeks later!Great towels and worth the wait however. I may order more now, in time for guests at thanksgiving!"
1,Absolutely terrible,"These towels are heavily dyed and don't hold their color. After 5 times through the wash, the red towels will still stain other items. The fabric pulls and the quality is the worst I've seen. I bought towels at Bed, Bath & Beyond for 1/3 the price that are 10X as good."
2,BEWARE OF COLOR,"I received two bath towels, good quality, softness, size etc but the color is not what is in the photo. It says lime and on screen looks like a light, sea green. Well, the towels arrived and they were a hideous neon green. Think ecto-cooler or a color a WWF wrestler would wear. gross. Fortunately, I returned for a full refund. I hope to buy the white to avoid and more color confusion."
2,Misleading ad!,The 1 and only towel you get is a decent towel. Too bad their picture shows 2 towels and a wash cloth. Even though they only talk about a towel in the ad. A picture is worth a thousand words. Just not in this case. Buyer beware!!!
4,Color info,"I ordered these towels in Teal which is a difficult color to nail down. These are definitely a dark blue teal. They are a very nice quality, very thick. I would be interested in purchasing more of them. They were shipped in 3 lots. First one washcloth, secondly the bath and handtowels and lastly one washcloth. Kinda ridiculous but I didn't have to pay the shipping. It was not fast."
5,Definitely Red!,"If you are looking for a true red, this is it! The color is awesome. The texture and quality of the towels are really great and they wash up wonderfully without fading or running."
2,Not as good as expected,I purchased the towels in the dark blue color. They shed a lot of lint but worse than that they pick up so much lint that they look shabby.
4,very clean sound but...,"This might be the best speaker available in its price range. But the reason I gave 4 stars is because of the sound quality of its tweeter. Mid-range sound is well defined and bass is relatively clear and not blurry at all. But somehow high frequencies sound, despite of their so called 'silk dome tweeter' is not very good. Does it ruin the listening experience? Not really. But it would be perfect if the tweeter could produce a little better sound."
4,Only for true ELP fans,"I am glad I purchased this box set. It has its flaws but overall its worth it. The packaging is cheap, but I bought it for the music. Some of the material like the Gaelic Park and Louisville sounded straight out of Napster, but the Long Beach arena show alone was worth the cost of box set. The version of Tarkus is one of the best. Buy this boxset, but only if you are really into ELP."
3,On the pricey side...,"This was purchased for work a few years ago because we do a lot of trainings outside of the office. We found that it was very difficult sliding the easel up. Once we got it all set up, it was very stable and wonderful to use. A few months ago we noticed that the hinges connected from the tubing to the plastic have popped out. This has made it very unstable now. Called the manufacture and there is no way to fix it. Disappointed that we spent so much on this and only got a few years (with little use) out of it."
1,Second Rate Egg Slicer,"On the third or fourth use several wires just came apart rendering it completely useless, except maybe as a paperweight...."
2,Adequate though Needs Improvement,"My wife would prefer that this would disassemble more for cleaning. It sometimes comes out of the dishwasher with egg on it if it isn't thoroughly cleaned. Other than that, it works as advertised and slices eggs and strawberries well."
1,Wouldn't slice mushrooms!,We've had this since July and used it very infrequently on eggs. The wire cutters broke today when my wife tried to slice mushrooms. We are very disappointed.
1,Doesn't even deserve one star,"Like another user the wires on the cutter broke during the second time I had used it. It contains 2 cutters for different cutting options and wires on both of the cutters snapped. In addition, when wanting to slice the egg I found it annoying trying to seperate the two layers of cutters which are permanantly affixed to the device."
5,Practical Guide to Getting What you Want,"John and Bonney make the relationship mystery much clearer in their book Becoming Soulmates. The ideas are easy to understand, very effective and have had a lasting effect on how I relate to people. By understanding what's behind the struggle, it is easier to see new paths to freedom in relationship. This is a ""must have"" for anyone wanting a soul-full relationship."
4,interesting video; dated,"I love documentaries, so I am a bit biased. My husband fell asleep! The only complaint is that the content was probably made in the 1980s, so I'm sure there is more information on the smaller site Herculaneum since the film was made. You cannot rent this or stream it, so you have to purchase it. I may just donate or resell."
2,bought for my baby,"I bought this float for my 10 month old. Here are the pros- I like the canopy! And the price. However, I have more negatives for this product and am needing to buy another one. My baby is 24 lbs, and has chubby legs. Well even that doesn't help with the HUGE leg holes. She looks so uncomfortable. She sits to one side, and the part between her legs is so narrow. It's safe, but it doesn't support her so she is comfortable. Plus the floatie around her body does not support her because it is so big around. So all in all, she doesn't look comfortable. Always wants out!"
4,Fun 1st-time Floatie,"This is the first floatie my daughter has ever been in, it was the perfect size, great coverage from the sun and overall fun for her to use."
2,not so great,"My main issue with the flower baby float is that I thought I was buying the starfish baby float. The starfish float is erroneously pictured under the flower baby float caption. I didn't realize the discrepancy until I received my order, and it was too late to return the float since we were leaving for our vacation in 2 days. Reading the other reviews, I'm not sure if people were reviewing the starfish float or the flower float. Regardless, the ""flower"" part does not provide any shade and even in a light breeze flies backward, which was a nuisance and overall made the float a hazard. We ended up deflating that part of the float the first day, and then my husband cut the flower off entirely. My 6 month old could barely see above the sides of the float and was uncomfortable in it. We ended up not using it much and didn't bother packing it for the trip home. I would like to try the starfish float - that looked sturdier and the canopy looked like it might actually provide some shade."
2,Not the best in the market.,"Bought two of these for my wife's SUV, and one lasted only a few months and the oil leaked out. The other is still working good. Next time I will just buy the ones from the dealer built for the vehicle."
3,"A good buy, but definitely far from being the ULTIMATE","I had high hopes when I bought this cookbook simply because it bills itself as THE ultimate cheesecake cookbook. Heck, I bought it without even browsing through it! It's easy enough to read: directions on how to make a perfect cheesecake, pointers to remember, etc. There are also sections for baked, non-baked and other people's favorite cheesecakes. The book's drawback is that it has NO PICTURES - not one (save for the one on the cover). For a cookbook especially, pictures are what urge and inspire the reader to try the recipe. Secondly, the recipes for the no-bake cheesecakes are (almost) the same as the baked ones. No fair! Do buy this book if you're just starting to make cheesecakes -the book will be a good guide. But if you're familiar with making cheesecakes, this book will only bore you with its lack of variety."
4,Cheescake Rookie,"I love to make desserts, especially cheesecake but before I bought this book I had only attempted 1. Now I can't stop making them. I thought the book provides good directions and has a lot of helpful hints on the right and wrong of cheescake making. The only negative is that there are only so many recipes and those are limited. But on the flip side I think this book provides a good foundation for branching out to try your own recipes."
4,Good book to have,Offers a variety of cheesecakes and cheesecake recipes. Has several different flavors to choose from. Would recommend this book for home use.
5,Peace for the world,Bahaullah wrote these short verses of wisdom at a time of great need for spiritual understanding for all mankind. They are inspiring and universal remedys for all beliefs. The best gift you could give yourself or a friend.
5,A Day At the lake,"I had had the Hidden Words book given to me by a friend. I had looked through it a few times although I never really took time to read it all that closely. Well about a month or so ago my parents took my best friend and I out to a lake with them and we just happened to take our little collection of Baha'i books along with us. It was a wonderful day! We found an abandoned dock and carried a little radio and a blanket out on it and read the entire book that day, while listening to classical music on the radio. It was so amazing. Right as we completed the book the sun was beginning to go down and beautiful white doves flew over head. Ever since that day this book has been a personal favorite of mine. Any time I am feeling down I can open it up and read a selection from it and instantly feel a little better. I recommend this book to anyone; Baha'i or not.... it is just a wonderful use of prayer and poetry combined .... and can uplift any spirit!!!!!"
5,Great book of essays,"This is an interesting book all about an unusual subject:Turquise, as a mineral and as a color. One thing I liked is that each of the essays is self contained so one can put the book down and pick it back up at a later date if you like and you don't miss anything. Another thing I liked is that I learned quite a few things, for example the mineral Turquise is not only found in the American southwest. Read the book and find out where else it is minned. This is a book I will keep and reread. In fact the first thing I did upon finnishing it was to order a copy for a friend!If you like this book you will like her other books as well.Raven's Exile: A Season on the Green RiverAfter I finnished reading the book I discovered she has fund in her name that suppoerts desert writers: http://www.ellenmeloy.com/."
2,kindle version bad,This is a good book but the kindle version is full of mistakes. Buy the hardback copy. Do not waste your money on the Kindle version.
4,Interesting subject.,"I am sorry I haven't had a chance to read it yet, though it came recommended and looks like a fascinating anthology about a beautiful stone!"
4,It was good but could be better,"Shining StarOn the court with Kobe Bryant by: Matt Christopher. Its s a young star named Kobe Bryant, that lived in Los Angeles CA. He lived with is father Joe (Jellybean) Bryant. They both loved basketball, Joe played in the NBA and played for the Knicks. Joe taught Kobe a lot of it. When Kobe went to High School, he played basketball too. He went to Lower Marion High. He had good grades all year round, that's why he got drafted out of high school for the NBA. Kobe was drafted in 1997 to the Phoenix Suns and the LA. Lakers traded a 1-2 draft picks for him. In 1997 he won rookie of the year award in 1999 he won the slam dunk contest. 2000-2003 they won the finals in a row. They have the most finals won in the entire NBA.By: Ryan R"
5,Required reading for death penalty activists,"Bedau's collection of studies, essays, and criticisms put the practice of the death penalty under a spotlight in very straighforward, rational, and sometimes tehnical terms. (For a more personal account of the death penalty, check out Michael Mello's book Dead Wrong.) Overall this book takes a cold hard look at the reality of capital punishment and what it is doing to the United States and it's citizens. It's only a shame that only anti-death penalty people will probably read it, but then the closer you examine capital punishment, the harder it is to justify."
1,I still believe in our system,"I still am in favor of keeping the capital punishment system in our country after reading this book. Some people preach ""Compassion"", ""Love"", and ""Mercy"", but what about Justice? Do we care more about the murderer than the victims? ...how many people have been accidentally executed and proven innocent? My studies show 2. How many innocent victims have died to murderers on parol, countless."
3,Hrm...It's just okay.,"1. it doesnt last up to 10 hours...on the low setting, it lasts up to 7 hrs at the most. which is highly dissappointing.2. Since this is my 1st humidifier ever, i dont have a basis of comparison for how well it works though. However, when i woke up this morning, my nose didnt hurt half as bad from being dried out."
4,good travel humidifier,"I have a lot of trouble with dry air in hotels when I travel, especially during the winter in the mountains. This is a good humidifier that easily fits into a carry on bag.The biggest problem I had with it is that it doesn't quite last a night's sleep. So what I did was right after checking in, I would turn on the humidifier on HIGH. Go out, eat dinner, etc. Then just before going to sleep, I would refill it and set it on LOW. Even though it would run out, the humidity would be at a comfortable level. So I can sleep restfully.Notes: it does get the area around it wet, so you may want to set it on a towel (plenty of extra's in hotels). And depending on the water quality, it can leave mineral-like deposits. So you may need to clean it after each use (or maybe use filtered water)."
2,Too small for a bedroom,"This one is too small for a bedroom, just like a toy. I returned this one and reordered Sunbeam 701-000 Ultrasonic Humidifier, which is much bigger. Generally speaking, the ultrasonic humidifier is much quieter than the regular ones."
2,The Hipster Spies With His Little Eye Something That Begins With--A poor value,"Humidity vanishes the instant it is switched off.Does NOT work for 10 hours, more like 6.As it ages, it gets REALLY noisy.Hard to clean.Nightlight is a nuisance, & cannot be turned off."
1,Not for us,"We bought this unit for our bedroom because we had used a similar unit before and liked how quiet it was. This unit was quiet, definitely put humidity in the air in our room. The downside however, is that the carpet around the unit was getting wet, so we put a towel underneath, which turned out to be soaked, along with the carpet after running all night. This was unacceptable so we returned the unit."
4,Portable but does not last through the night.,"Very portable and easy to use. Works beautifully, but needs to be refilled with water after 4-6 hours of use. Does not last through the night without refilling."
5,Fun from Frisco (for a change),"I just discovered this band and I'm loving them. GREAT harmonies. Terrific hooks. San Francisco has always been about guy/girl harmonies and these kids carry on that tradition... but this ain't hippie music. It's pure pop. Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, Sam Phillips, Aimee Mann... that's all in there and more.Clever, delightful songs. Pick it up."
1,Yawn...,"As an avid fan of Jennings, I was delighted when I ran across the Spangle series. Unfortunately, I found The Road Show so incredibly boring, that I didn't bother finishing the rest of the series. What a contrast to his other fine work such as Aztec, The Journeyor, and Raptor..."
2,Sort of like junk food,"I agree with others that if you think you're getting another Aztec, you'll be really disappointed. There is nothing compelling enough about it to recommend anyone to buy it, but if you find it at a yard sale for 50 cents, keep in your car for traffic jams."
5,A masterpiece!!,"The book itself is let's say an opulent spume of knowledge!! Mr. Temple deftly wrote his masterpiece and that is why I guess it looks so fecund for those of you who are voracious fans of all the space mysteries, aliens and stuff like that. The flux is shown as a really very ebullient thing itself and also it wakes up your hidden temptation to re-read the book repeatedly, again and again. I still have sort of a spiritual exaltation of mine and I suggest you to try it out and to read the book by Robert K. G. Temple called ""the Sirius Mystery"". Why not to open a new mystery for yourself??"
1,Disappointing,"Has some initial good information about martial arts in general, but tends to be very negative. Is also contradictory at times. Book is also outdated in several areas. Author tends to start mantras sometimes unrelated to spirituality or martial arts. Disappointing to say the least. Much better books at there like Zen in the Martial Arts."
4,Great Addition to your Cookbook Library,"Great introduction to diabetes and proper nutrition in the forward. I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the recipes in this book. One of my favorites is the Black Bean Burritos and then turn it into the Southwest Omelet for breakfast. The desserts are a little weak but that is often the case with diabetic recipes. Could use more photos. Wonder why most cookbooks lack that presentation factor? Regardless, highly recommend this cookbook if you want to eat healthy."
4,Good product for convenience,"While not as good as fresh, this product serves a great service, because it's on hand. I was throwing out half used cartons of sour cream because not used in time. I like it."
4,Good,I use this in a salad ceaser dressing so I don't get the full flavor of the sour cream. I will buy it again.
1,Sour cream powder,"Due to getting a comment which pointed out that I had failed to change the rating, I have now done so. Thank you to the one who brought this goof to my attention. The original 5-star rating was for the speed in shipping. If I could give this product a minus rating, I would, because it really is awful; a true waste of money. I would not even use this in a baked product where other flavors might come into play."
5,I Could Read It Again and Again!,"I actually bought this book for my landscape gardener because I thought it was one of the most beautiful and well-written books on gardening and our natural environment that I have ever read. Others feel that way, too, because the new copy arrived with an award sticker on the front! I would give it 10 stars."
5,The American Woodland Garden,"Next garden I have anything to do with will be a ""Woodland Garden"" but tough on 1/4 acre. Beautiful book, informative and inspiring and, for an English gardener, a wonderful introduction to Native American trees and plants."
3,Cannondale Prophet,This is a great item but my mountian bike has a lefty fork and it didn't fit as designed for my bike. I made a tool that allows the proper use of this rack adapter. Yakima should indicate which bikes it won't work with.
1,"can not fit my 24"" mountain bike","I purchased it on Amazon for my wife's 24"" mountain bike. Even in its shortest length, it is still too long to secure between head tube and seat pole. Need to return it. Amazon needs to have much more clear description (especially working length) for this item."
2,Doesn't work for large frames,"I bought this to work with a bike without a top tube that I currently have to mount ""upside-down"" and use the angled downtube to mount. However this put the bike up very high and blocks rear view. However, this adapater does not work well with very large (ie: long) frames. The problem is in the basic design that this adapter will almost ""pull apart"" and not stay very solid at full extension. It almost feels like it will snap apart when fully extended and loaded with the bike on the hitch. I can't use it with my bike, but it does work with my kids bikes which are much smaller. For my bike I have tried a friends Saris adapter that works much better for a large bike and I am looking into buying this instead."
2,Disappointing,"There are four basic deficiencies with this product:1)It is not spring loaded so it is not as secure as it could be.2)Extending and contracting is difficult and not smooth, making it hard to adjust to any length other than fully extended or fully contracted.3)The ""loops"" open up or down and not sideways which makes it more cumbersome to install on the bike.4)The buttons that you must press to open the loops are recessed too far down making it difficult to openThe Swagman (Swagman Bar Adapter Deluxe)and the SparehandSpareHand Bike Frame Adaptorbike frame adaptors do not have these flaws and are much better."
5,Yakima Bike rack adapter,"Great product. Easy to use, and serves the purpose it is designed for. I would recommend for any use by anyone who has a bike with a slanted bar, such as a ladies bike."
5,"YAKIMA Bike Adapter Bar, Great Use!","My fiance and I purchased this adapter for her bike to go onto our bike rack for a recent vacation to the mountains. Upon trying to put my mountain bike on the rack I discovered I needed the adapter as well with my unique bike frame, I thought it would work obviously but was mistaken this never happens lol.Any way I used the adapter on the bike rack and tested it out it works well and its very sturdy and safe highly recommend you can get a cheaper on at wal-mart but you kinda pay for what you get I think. This was one of best buys thus far for our bike's/bike rack and we are actually getting another one real soon before we go on our next trip!"
4,bicycle,"The adapters are strong and durable. When i purchased the yakima bike carrier in a store where I live I was not told that I needed extra equipment. I had a difficult time locating these adapters, but did find them on Amazon ,com. If i knew that I would have to buy extra equipment for the carrier, i am not sure that I would have purchased the carrier. The price of adapters is expensive."
4,Necessary for transport,"This was not a perfect fit for my wife's hybrid bike but it works well. The strong, non-scratch surface keeps the bike in place on the Yakima King Joe rack. The instructions on the box were a bit vague but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how this is suppose to be attached to the bike."
2,"Ok, but not ideal",I bought this for my Trek step through bike and I don't like that the bike just sits on the bar. The bike was at an odd angle on the rack and front tire hung very low. I am going to try one of the spring loaded ones so the bike isn't at an angle and so I can mount it higher on the rack. It was also expensive for what it is.
3,Does the job,"Purchased the Tube Top to go on my wife's bike when we put it on the Yakima rack. It worked well, the buttons are hard to push and the fact that it doesn't lock in place when you extend it, is a little off putting. Over all, it did the job, however, the tube doesn't fit into the rack component very well, but once you strap it down, it's very secure."
2,Not safe for trunk mounted rack,"I used this in conjunction with the Yakima KingJoe. This adapter does the job of making a crossbeam for mounting purposes; however, it does not hold the bike enough to keep it from swaying.When this was used on my girlfriend's hybrid bike, the crossbeam was not at the right angle, making it the front tires 3 inches from the pavement when mounted on the KingJoe. When getting off my driveway, the tire would rub the driveway. I would assume all crossbeams will have this issue though. If you must purchase a crossbeam adapter, choose another brand (maybe something spring loaded that will put more presure on the bike)."
4,Very nice.,"I had a cheaper one of these things that scratched my stem up. This was is nice because the parts that attach to your bike are made of a very sturdy plastic (they may be reinforced underneath with metal, I'm not sure) so it won't scratch your frame. Also there is no tension bar that you must fight with to get it on your bike. My only quibble would be the small button used to unlatch the hooks. You really have to press in there to get it to move, so you won't be winning any races for speed when mounting this thing, although it's a really minor quibble..."
1,Hugely disappointing,"Don't bother. I don't know what the producers were thinking about, but this will put you to sleep. If you think you're going to get a ""sensational"" encapsulized look at '76, forget it. It wanders, wastes time, misses important moments. A bad, bad, bad effort. I rated this at one star only because you don't get the option here to give anything a zero."
2,Written in 1925 language,This is a very wordy description of Medieval villages. I found the language to be obtuse and the descriptions overly lengthy. It took me a long time to slog through it. The material could have been presented in a much more logical way.
1,Snake oil,"I believe in the ""Ancient Alien"" theory, but this DVD set doesn't provide info or details about anything. It is poorly directed and produced. It just professes a secret mystery that it never seems to outline. It is surprisingly bad considering that it features John Anthony West. If you want to explore alternative theories on Ancient Egypt, see ""The Mystery of the Sphinx"" DVD hosted by Charlton Heston (get the expanded director's cut), and ""The Pyramid Code"" DVD by Carmen Boulter. Both of these DVD's feature the theories of John Anthony West, but in a professional production. They are clear, concise and to the point. If you want to explore the mysteries of consciousness and religion, get anything by Joseph Campbell, and pick up ""The Great Year"" DVD by Walter Cruttenden."
5,Very Happy,TheTimberland Roller Buckle Belt 1700 is the best belt buckle I have ever used. I have owned two or three and they are still working
4,Nice Shoe,"I liked this shoe, but I have a difficult foot to fit. I have wide toes, narrow heel, and high arch that needs an orthotic arch support. This shoe fit my foot well in a 7 Wide, but it didn't have enough room for the arch support & my foot felt squeezed. I returned to shoe to get a different Saucony shoe with more room for arch supports.Otherwise, this shoe was really nice. If you don't need orthotics in your shoes it would be a really good shoe for you. I hated to have to return it."
2,Hurt my back,With my orthotic it was too high of a footbed even with their insole taken out. The shoe made my foot roll to the outside when it never does that. Took out my orthotic and put their insole back in but it is a bad shoe for me.
3,disappointed,sadly not as special as I had hoped for/my feet were just as sore as inexpensive shoes/sizing is true size for my foot.
3,"Could be better, could be worse!","I bought these shoes because they supposedly have good arch support and help with pronation. Well, neither is true for me, but with my custom arch supports inserted in them, they are tolerable. I like how they look and they are comfortable otherwise. They fit true to size."
2,Not as comfortable,I've only wore these a few times from 6-12hour shifts twice a week and the bottom of my right shoe has began making a squeaky noise every time that I step. They aren't as comfortable as the first day that I wore them and the noise is annoying. I am now purchasing another pair (different brand) to replace these just after a few wears.
4,a little narrow,"Great shoe, just a little more narrow than I expected and a little more narrow than the same shoe in black."
2,Defective,"I loved the look of the shoe and the fit. I am a nurse who woks 12 hour shifts and I needed a good fitting shoe. However, I wore the shoes for 2 shifts and then the left shoe began to squeak with everyLeft step. Even my co workers commented so therefore I have to return the shoe."
4,"Wonderful Sneaker, great for walking","I loved this sneaker however, it runs a size smaller just like Sketchers does. I am a size 10 in shoes and in sneakers, but I had to return them to get a size 11. (I have a normal size foot/toes, no compensation needed with the size). Once I got the next size, it was wonderful! Store clerks at Rack Room shoes confirmed the size difference. I took off one star for the inconvenience of not knowing about the sizing issue."
5,"Lightweight, comfy, cushioned, adequately wide in W size",I injured my hip and use special inserts. I purchased these shoes to cushion my walking. I have a wide foot and these fit very well with heavy socks and the inserts. They are lightweight and I recommend them. It is hard to find W women's shoes in the local stores. I appreciate Amazon.com carrying these sizes.
5,"Great support, consider going a 1/2 size up","I bought these shoes for a per diem hospital job with 12 hr shifts after seeing all the great reviews from nurses. Try them! I did not like dansko's because my ankles seem to roll easily. These Saucony shoes give the clunky-supportive feel of a clog with the squishy ankle support of a sneaker. The heels especially have great support, doesn't even feel like my heel is on the ground. They are much more lightweight than I expected.I am usually a 7 medium, but they felt too short so I returned them for 7.5 medium. These two sizes felt exactly the same in width, but the 7.5 gave me perfect wiggle room in front of my toes so I can wear thin or thick socks.Update: After wearing these shoes for three 12hr nights in a row, I love them! My feet were not a factor at all, and usually tired/sore feet wear me down at work. Thanks for the great product."
5,Great shoe,The fit is prefect for my wide foot and pleanty of cushen under the heals for all day walking. Highly recomended.
5,Great blanket & pillow for traveling!,"Buy this so you don't get tempted to take one of those used dirty blankets on the air plane. The inflatable pillow is great, I found it best at the lower part of my back for comfort, inflate and deflate to your satisfaction. The blanket is big enough to share with your flying partner, and folds up easy and back into the carry bag with ease. I'm glad I purchased this all in one travel blanket and pillow."
5,Great quote book...,"I highly recommend this worthy publication. I consider it a much better ""quotations book"" than the current (17th) edition of Bartlett's, because of its superior balance and more representative content. The organization is by author, although it does have an excellent and very extensive index, as well as a (rather small) topic-oriented content section.If you need and/or enjoy ""quote books"" you simply must have this one."
5,Oxford Dictionary of Quotatios,"The Dec. 25th giftee couldn'rt put it down, even we gathered as 18 people all day. Once he opened it, it was in his hands, and he'd be opening to a new page. I was thankful to get this in time for wrapping and giving on 12/25."
3,Good Reference,This book is a compendium of quotes but is unwieldy in its presentation. I believe many of the quotes are pertinent but some easier type of guide to finding them would be helpful.
2,Not my cup of tea,"The following comments refer to the second (1955) edition. Let us hope the third edition is substantially improved.A stuffy, dated, donnish, and relentlessly Anglocentric compilation, reeking of the classics curriculum at Oxford. According to the preface, familiarity is the chief criterion for inclusion. Familiarity to whom, for heaven's sake? Professors of antique languages and literatures? Horace gets seven pages. Emily Dickinson gets two lines, as does Hawthorne. Melville and Conrad get nothing at all. ""The horror! The horror!"""
4,Great toy for kids who like to build and do pretend play,"My 5YO son loved putting this together. He insisted on building it in one stretch, which does take a long attention span. It has great details and comes with accessories to promote imaginitive play. We just bought the fire station too, but haven't tackled it yet. I recommend this product for preschoolers/kindergarten/first grade."
4,Nice for the Price,"These gloves are nice for the price. Material allows for a good grip, but I wish they were a little thicker to protect from rose thorns. Also, they seem to run a little big."
5,Awesome book!,"I think Gladys Alward is an amazing book. I have read it at least 3 times. It is a very good book. It shows one woman's plight to get to China. There is amazing detail and very exciting parts. The book also shows how God works in many situations. It has interesting places, cool people, and lots of missionary work. Some parts of it are sad while others are happy. The book covers how Gladys gets to China, does mission work, and survives the Japanese invasion. My favorite part is when the Japanese invade and Gladys has too save herself and others. I think Gladys is a brave woman to do what she did. It is a very good read and I think people of all ages will like it."
5,A real page turner! I couldn't put the book down!!!,Really enjoyed this book. It was very easy to read and I didn't want to stop till I finished the whole book. Packed with adventure and suspense! What a wonderful example of a real Christian.
2,A beginner's workout,"The routines were definitely at the beginner level .. which would be fine except the back cover states for beginner through advanced. The instructor wasn't breathing hard and neither was I (I'm at the intermediate level). On the plus side, the instructor has a pleasant personality and the moves are easy to follow. So if you are an absolute beginner, I would give this 3 or 4 stars. If you're more advanced than that, I would look elsewhere."
4,"Good quality, easy flush.","What can you say. It does the job and easy easy to flush. I have all water in the kitchen going through a gang of these. Seems like it filters well. Ice isn't extremely clear, but that could be other factors causing it. No smell, tastes great, happy with them. I buy a case at a time."
1,Poorly Written and Poorly Edited,"This book overly dramatizes a situation that was already dramatic on its own. It uses obscene language just for the purpose of being obscene. The editing is terrible. I found mistake after mistake, even on the back cover of the book. Frank Snepp's ""Decent Interval"" and David Butler's ""The Fall of Saigon"" are both far superior to this almost fictional account. This book reminds me of a modern action movie. It is written for twelve-year olds who want to see lots of special effects, but no substance."
1,Don't Bother,"I had a lot of problems with the book. It looks like the writer did a bunch of interviews and then wrote the book and guessed at the spelling of Vietnamese names. Most of the book seems to be recreated conversations that we are suppose to believe were repeated word-for-word as they were spoken in 1975. Very tedious reading that including things such as what type of sandwich a Marine was eating when an alleged verbatim conversation is detailed, along with the color of the soda can and that a female State Department employee took one of the Marine's potato chips during the conversation. Most of it is like reading a screen play instead of what is supposed to be ""The True Story of the US Marines Last Days in Vietnam."" With so many errors regarding the names, among other things, I developed doubts about the accuracy of everything in the book. I regret having purchased the book as it is among the worst I have read about the war."
1,Where is my stuff,I bought this set on Dec 4th and paid for 2 day shiping. No knives!!!!! Then i wanted to contact amazon no contact info what the hell is going on here.
2,Not a Farberware,"Its not from Faberware. Not written anywhere, ITS ONLY from TRISTAR. I don't know why they say its from faberware..sharpness is bad too.."
4,sharp would be nice,"Great set I just wish the larger knives would of been sharper, but that's ok it come with a sharpner"
5,Great Cutlery Set!,Beautiful set and the knives are high quality. I am very pleased with my purchase. The only thing is that the brand is not Farberware--it's tristar. I really can't tell a difference in quality (the knives are high quality).
1,"A ""How to"" book that doesn't explain anything","This was one of the most aggravating books I've ever read. The book purports to explain color correction but does not guide you through the process. Instead it gives you directions like ""first adjust the black levels, then move on to fine tune the colors...""Without actually telling you how to perform any of the adjustments the book is describing it's almost worthless. The reader is left with the same questions they had before they read it."
2,Very Basic Information,Web has much much better information than this book. The author has tried to tell everything WITHOUT TELLING ANYTHING.Don't get impressed by the good ratings/nice printing. Borrow the book from library...have a look and then think of buying.
3,"A good overview, but not superb","The book does a good job of being an overview for color correcting video - but unfortunately because it avoids anything application specific it fails to show you how to do stuff in your specific NLE. Training dedicated to a specific application & color correction- like my FCP training DVD by Digital Film Tree is much better because it teaches the theory AND the tool - so you cover both angles while this was just the theory. But that may be what you want - or your NLE may not have a book about color correction dedicated to it. If you're a FCP user, there's a book called 'Advanced Finishing Techniques' in the Apple Training Series that I would recommend over this one."
4,Great help for carb junkies!,This book was informative. I learned alot about depression and eating habits and hormones! He wrote the book as if he was sitting across from you and actually talking to you. He covers alot of scientific material in a way that doesn't bog you down. Great job!
5,Really Helped!,I had no idea how to control my eating before this book... It totally turned my life around. I've lost 15 pounds in the month and a half since I finished it... and I don't even follow their diet. It's awesome! Try it!01-22-2012 - As an update to my previous review. I have lost 60lbs overall. What a great feeling knowing how to control the relationship I have with food. Try the book!
4,Information very informative,"This has been very helpful in explaining the biology behind my food addiction. One quick response to a previous viewer: A psychiatrist IS an MD. Medical school, internships -- the whole works. The difference is that they do their residency in psychiatry, as opposed to surgery, family practice, etc. I would feel very bad if others readers were swayed by the misinformation of the previous post."
2,I found the writing style insultingly condesceding,"If you can plow through the disgustingly cutesy-poo writing style and boring background, you'll find that Keene (who is a psychiatrist, NOT an MD) has two actual statements: Prozac is the best treatment for stubborn food addiction, and before resorting to Prozac, you should subject yourself to his extremely restrictive diet plan and never eat foods containing flour or any other processed ingredients again for the rest of your life. (Personally, I'd rather be fat than go without cookies for the rest of my life.) The book does seem well researched, but I only recommend it for those planning to strictly adhere to the diet plan -- and even then, you should skip to the relevant chapter and avoid as much of the text as possible. Someone hire this guy a ghostwriter!"
1,Very poor choice of words,"I was really excited about this book b/c of the diversity of kids on the cover and the topic in general. However I should have definitely read it myself before presenting it to my daughter. Although she did not complain - as I read the book, the word ""different"" was repeated way too many times. I started to get the feeling that I was pointing out to her that she was in some way so different from everyone else. I felt like the book lost it's purpose in that it made differences seem so prominent instead of portraying that we are all the same but unique in our own ways. Looking again, I realize that this was first written in 1976... I guess the way we look at diversity has changed... poor book choice in my opinion... not what I was looking for."
2,Good message damaged by preachy presentation,"While my 3-1/2 year old daughter seems to like this book well enough, I dislike reading it to her. The message is a positive one (we're all different in some way) and relies on interesting examples (food allergies, for example). However, the overall product is preachy and rather dull. Without a plot, just a series of kids who each describe the way in which they are different, it isn't much fun to read."
5,Margo has the greatest voice!,Margo Smith's voice hasn't changed in 40 yr. Her voice is beautiful and songs have a lot of meaning.
4,A very nice and funny book,This is a book that brings you back to your childhood. It shows the world in it`s real light through the eyes of a 10yr old. It will certainly make you laugh and read it over and over again. I think this book is great. Make sure to read it.
5,Les Recres Du Petit Nicolas,This is the book used in a French language course for adults. It is just the right book for this purpose
5,Easy Implementation,"I saw that this book was developed on the author's ServerSide.com site with a lot of input from other developers, and it shows. And Marinescu gives you the code, which made it a lot easier to implement the solutions. Definitely five stars, and thanks!"
2,Looks like a copy of Sun's Book,"I picked up this book and besides thinking that much of it is strategies, vs patterns, I think much of this is already in Sun's J2EE Patterns book."
4,Lots of good ideas,"This is a book that completes other design pattern books. Most of the information is already on the web. However, the author gives alot of easy to understand examples.Unfortunately if you are looking for larger exmaples or more complex issues this is not the book for you."
5,stress and health,"A wonderful book on the mind body connection. In the modern world of medicine, too often we treat symptoms and not behaviors and life choices, Even psychology is more interested in outcomes, than the root of our problems. Well written, informative, and inspiring of hope."
3,Cute color!,"I loved the bag's color....alot smaller than I wanted, considering the price but I guess that's my fault! (shoulda paid more attention to the measurements in the description) Just thought the description should have included the word ""small"". Also, using the USPS for shipping was EXTREMELY slow! I'll be more aware of these things next time. But, I wanted a pink handbag...I got that!"
3,Artificial Flavors??,Disappointed that the product did not disclose artificial flavors..not so good coming from an all natural company.
2,looks like a good product but no directions.,"They put the SKU right over the directions on how to rehydrate. There are no directions on their website and I am stuck with a product I can't use. What good is a label if they cover it up? I can't read the ingredients or the directions. Barry Farm had plenty of room on the package for the sku, so why right over important information? Very unhappy."
2,Didn't get what I wanted.,"I searched for a yogurt starter on Amazon and this product came up as an option.When I received it there was a sticker ""not to be used as starter"".Amazon did agree to take back the unopened bag. I don't know what to do with the remainderof the open one."
5,ALMOST THE KNUTH APPROACH TO DATA STRUCTURES,"I had found this book a few years ago, in my Master's, working on the side-project for my thesis. I started using the Knuth's books, for designing the data structures. First time I started working with it, I found the same level as on Knuth's, but using C. Fantastic. I did not have to think in PASCAL em C anymore, only in C. It cut my cycle to one third of the time."
4,"Should be called ""Data Structures and C Algorithms""","I found this book valuable to understand advanced, necessary, concepts in C: pointers, stacks and queues, memory organization, search algorithms, hashing, sorting trees, priority queues, and other basic advanced topics. In each topic, the book also goes into performance analysis, using O-notation. The book also uses pseudocode to help understand the algorithms, without the drawbacks of actual code. However, what I found bizarre about this book is that the first chapters (of basic concepts) had code examples, while the latter ones did not! Surely, a well-commented example of a red-black tree program would be the last step in teaching it. Especially in a book about ""C programs""."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this set as Wal-Mart. What a waste. The scissors are not good for cutting much besides paper, and the knives rust easily. You basically need to hand dry them very thoroughly or the blades will rust. Mine have rusted even from air drying in my dish rack. By the way, they are not dishwasher safe."
2,Red Rice,"I like black rice, brown rice and the red rice tastes fine. The problem I have is what it looks like after it's cooked. Eat one bite, went for a second one and just could not do it. Remember you eat with the eyes first. Well I just could not get passed the look. Would say the rice just is not for everyone."
2,mixed reviews - strong nutty flavor,"This rice had mixed reviews at out house. One person hated it, two thought it was ok and one liked it becasue of the strong nutty flavor. There was no cooking instructions and I think mom cooked it like wild rice for 45 minutes."
3,Exotic and nutty,"I really enjoyed the Himalayan red rice. It has a nice nutty flavor to it. I wouldn't serve it by itself, but cooked it with white and brown rice to add some color. It does tend to stain the white rice red. Very good, but shipping is high for what it is."
1,Not what I expected,"This book talks too much about past culture life. I was hoping it would have more on how to read body language. I was looking for a book more like The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals by Charles Darwin, and this book is nothing like it."
3,Book I was looking for,This was the book I was looking for but I received a really old version that is about to fall apart
3,Good book for beginners or intermediate engineer,"I purchased this book and returned it, not because it was a bad book, it wasn't. As a matter of fact had I not purchased a MPLS book already or owned the Moy OSPF book. O would have kept it. It is a good book that covers all the required routing protocols, albeit not in enough detail. The book always left me short on detail, I still had questions after I would read a section.So once again I would say that this is a good book but not a great one. If you are looking for some basics on RIP, OSPF, BGP and MPLS then this is a good book. If you are looking for more detail, like why do ILEC's have IBGP and OSPF running on the same router, and how are these routing protocols used in networks today with some real examples, then look somewhere else.Cheers!"
4,loved the book,"I loved the book, it present complex topics in simple words, it helped learn fast.for the price, this is a very nice deal"
1,The Kindle version sucks,"I purchased the Kindle version so I could read it on multiple devices and the digital conversion is HORRIBLE! Illustrations often end up separated from the text describing them, but far worse the grey box breakouts are almost unreadable!!! The scans of the text in the gray boxes are harder to read than the captcha phrases websites use to verify that you're human! On top of that the illustrations were scanned at a low enough resolution that they are rough to look at. They're generally functional, but way harder to read. If you're thinking about this book, I'd avoid the ebook version sadly.So far the content of the book has been like a college text book. Not great to read but does a decent enough job of getting the point across."
2,"It's full of nudity and sex, yet I was still bored",Conversations were painfully dragged out. Nicole Kidman's character talked too slow; it was annoying. The resolution was cheesy. The only thing it had going for it was a little shock value.
3,Not interesting,"Lots of skin, slow. I can't comolain about the acting but all scenes were drawn out and the plot did not make sense."
3,"Weird, disturbing movie","I am not a prude, but I was appalled by the amount of nudity and explicit sex in this movie. By all standards, it's porn. This is why I prefer the old movies."
4,Very good book!,This is the continuing story of Nathanial and Elizabeth Bonner and their family. This book takes it's focus from Nathanial and Elizabeth and gives the story of their eldest daughter Hannah. Even with the main characters shifting it is still engaging and a wonderful addition to the series and I am excited to move on to the next book. Worth the buy!!
2,Expected Better,I hope this isn't the last book in the series because it leaves way too many loose ends. I also felt kind of mislead by the book jacket and other reviews. A relationship that I thought would take center stage gets the short shrift and a character that I had no emotional investment in shows up in the last sixth of the book and is rushed into a romance which I felt was forced.
3,Disappointing - I wanted more romance,I missed the romance. I really enjoyed reading about the relationship growing between Nathaniel and Elizabeth in the first book. Romantic interactions were missing in this book. Hannah's journey was interesting however I wanted a bit of sizzle between her and the male characters she encountered. There was none.
3,Boring,"I eagerly awaited this book and was disappointed with it.I had to force myself to read it waiting for something to happen!I loved the first 2 books, but Lake in the Clouds was dragged out and just didn't keep me riveted."
2,Not so much,"I have really enjoyed the first two books in this series but I didn't like this one. I found myself feeling like I just wanted to get through it to the next one. I appreciate that these books have a pretty good authentic look at that time period but I just found all of it together depressing. I was also let down a bit by Hannah's story line. The situation with Liam felt like it didn't have enough closure and as much as I liked Strikes the Sky I felt like she should have been with Liam. I feel like any relationship she has will pale in comparison to what she could have had with him. This is probably just me, but that's how I felt. I also missed Nathanial and Elizabeth's in this book. I like the idea of getting to know new characters but I missed their presence. I will read the rest of the series and hope that they are a little more like the first two books."
5,loooovvee it!,"I LOVE SARA DONATI. ok, that's out of the way. i waited for this book from the second we ordered it and the second it arrived i tore open the box and started reading it. it didn't dissapoint me. the only thing i didn't like was that we missed so much of Lily's and Daniel's lives -- there should have been another book, even a very short one, set when they were around 4 years old. oh well. i still loved it!"
5,Easy to understand with lots of extras,This is a great dictionary! It has many charts to refresh your memory regarding pronouns and verb conjugation. The entries are easy to decipher (which I can't say for some dictionaries out there) so you find what you're looking for easily. Sometimes dictionaries should come with a user's manual to help people understand all the abbreaviations. This one is extremely straight forward and easy to understand. I would suggest this for any german student from beginner to advanced.
5,Lovely,"Shipping went great, arrived ahead of schedule, well packed, as described, in the rose damask box - my purchase was from The Fine China Store. Got this to serve as the tray with the large sugar & creamer pair, but is also perfect size for biscuits or other treats. Bone China, in case you are wondering. Good piece."
2,Dissenting opinion,"Although vivid, most of the essays in this book are far too short to address the complexities of each different personality. Beschloss's essay is the best; Morris', Caro's, and McCullough's good but inferior to their respective biographies of Reagan, Johnson and Truman. Goodwin's essay doesn't add much, and the editors get docked a star by choosing Benjamin Bradlee - of all people - to review Richard Nixon. A more impartial person and Nixon biographer (Stephen Ambrose? Tom Wicker?) would have been more appropriate. I think you are better off simply getting the biographies of Reagan, LBJ, Truman, and Clinton by Morris, Caro, McCullough, and Maraniss, respectively."
2,One sided,The book is mistitled as 'Principles' since it does not really do justice to the foundations of the field. It is more of a compilations of the research work of a 'few' investigators in the field.
3,"Not great, but not bad either.","Unlike a couple of other books in the Ravenloft series, this one at least fits the mood of Ravenloft in my opinion. I didn't think it was an outstanding book like some other people are saying, but it was worth reading. My only real hangup with this book was the rather humdrum ending. Bottom line, if you got the time and money, check out this book. But don't lose any sleep over it if you can't find it because it wasn't a *killer book* like ""Vampire of the Mists"", ""Knight of the Black Rose"", or ""I, Strahd""."
4,Can't believed I liked this book and feel like less of a man,"Call me sappy but I kind of liked this cajun-seasoned bodice ripper. It had some nice scenes and symbolism. It's no classic but enjoyable popcorn reading for sure, plus I think more people have read it then have actually played Ravenloft overall."
4,Great complete set,"Even though my boyfriend doesn't use everything, it's nice to have it just in case. And for the money, you can't beat the value! Original shipment was damaged upon arrival (gray casing) but had no problem returning it for another. Overall, very pleased with this set!"
1,Very Very Cheaply Made,"I wasn't expecting the highest quality set for the price, but I was excepting the pieces to at least fit into the box it came in. As soon as I opened the box, half the parts fell out (including the knife!) and most of them wouldn't lock into their placement in the box. Also, each of the pieces is very cheap and feels like they will break. And one thing they do not show you in the photos is the ridiculous packaging this set comes in. The box is almost humorous, like it's a joke set. I originally bought this as a gift and will be returning it instead because I am too embarrassed to give this to someone. Doesn't waste your money on this one."
4,Interesting collection,"I bought this book for one of my college English classes. It is a great mix of stories that can be interpreted in different ways. I liked the variety. There is some ""philosophical"" ideas in here, so beware if you dislike those. Overall, it is a great collection of stories about Utopias."
5,So fresh and clean! Works even for women!,"Note, I am a woman, but I got a free sample from my mom and used it (why not?) This cream is fresh and clean. i really feel it cleaning and scrubbing yet gentle for the face. This is the best facial scrub i've used. They need to market this for women too!"
3,good cleanser but didn't like the smell or cooling sensation,good facewashthis facewash has a strong scent and gives a cooling sensation both similar to typical mens aftershaveprefer shiseido's ts (the skincare) line to this b/c it doesn't have the above men oriented featuresthough the ts line costs morecleaning effectiveness is about the same compared to the ts line (which is pretty good)
3,Mediocre - too simple,"Maybe I started out to strong with the ""big"" I spy books for my 2 year old (which she loves!) this was too simple - I ordered it online, so I didn't get a chance to look throughout the book. I guess I expected more items on each page. My daughter rarely ever picks up this book, but the bigger I Spy books I need tape to keep them together :)"
5,I Spy Little Letters,"This is a nice little board book for little ones who have not yet started to read on their own. The puzzles are very easy compared to the paper back books. If your child has mastered the paperback books, these will not be a challenge to him/her."
3,More of a toddler level than preschool,"These books have great pictures and I love the concept. Just a word of warning that even though it says it is a preschool level, they are VERY easy. My three year old does not find them much of a challenge at all. I would classify these as more of a toddler level book."
4,One of The Better Little I Spy Books,"I like the Little Letters little I Spy book more than I like most of the other I Spy board books. The letters book is easy, like the rest of the Little I Spy book, but finding a letter is a new and special challenge for my 2 year old. Where the other I Spy board books seem a little too easy for him, the letters and numbers seem to be an adequate challenge, just because of the content. It shows a picture of the letter on the left page and the child finds the same letter on the right page. It is a good way to get a little letter play into his day."
5,Lots to look at!,"I spy with my little eye, a wonderful book for toddlers!This is such a great little book. My 3 year old loves the ""I Spy"" books, but this one goes a step further with other pictures on the page to go with the letters. Very clever!"
5,A Book that caputues the hidden feeling of society!,"Increible, por todos que le gustan las novellas que tienen un reaccion a la moda del mundo. Gives the reader a sense of environment and sheds light on the all too real problem of broken and abusive households.... giving the impact on the children as well. Me hace darse cuenta que los ninos son productos de su ambiente, somos que nos hacemos...somos unico es de las familias y cultures de sus ninez"
2,Wish I could return it.,"I was so excited to get this DVD based on the back cover. The first workout I did was the INTERVAL one and I was sorely disappointed. The workout is 20 minutes long and the first 10 minutes of the workout are all knee lifts. Nothing but knee lifts for about 10 minutes. Then when they introduced the first ""interval"" I barely noticed because my heart rate didn't even go up. It was more knee lifts which are very damaging to the tendons.Secondly, I did the other cardio workout on the DVD and it was stale, stale, stale kickboxing. You know, jab, hook, uppercut. Again my heart rate barely went up.I wish I could return this DVD and next time I see a SHAPE DVD I will rent it from the library and then consider buying it."
4,"Radical, but worth reading","I read this book for an introductory Hawaiian Studies class, and my first thought was to try and find some of whatever the author was smoking. In general, Trask is much too radical for my tastes. But she makes lots of very good points. I was shocked to see her accusing Gawan Daws of racism. I checked the passage she referred to in Shoals of Time, and sure enough, I could see that the paragraph was definitely racially insensitive. This is a book that really makes you think about things you've lived with in Hawai`i all your life and never really noticed. Trask may be a wingnut, but you should read her book anyway."
3,"Pretty good, kind of dry","This was pretty good, kind of dry but overall for the price and the content it is exactly what it says it is, a quick read that is thought provoking"
2,Not a good one after all,"I love classic guitar.So I tried this one. Unfortunately, this french piece is terrible expect 2 or 3 tracks good.It's so hard to find a good guitar CD!"
1,magnesium fire starter,this magnesium fire starter I received is not the 1 in the picture it is noticeably shorter only about 2 inches in length have bought multiple magnesium fire starters this is the first 1 I've purchased that was only 2 inches in length
2,Didn't like at all,"I purchase an HP NC6000 laptop from Techno Intellingece, not only was the delivery exceptional, but the customer service via phone and e-mail was just as good. I had problems with my HP NC6000, and they told me to send it back and they would immediately replace it. I sent it back and received another laptop right away, but not only did I get it replaced, but I was sent a better model, an HP NC 8000 and it works wonderfully! I look to doing business with them as well as my collegues that I told. I gave the item 2 stars for not working properly, but I give 5 stars to the sellers for awesome customer service. Once again, thank you!"
1,Rip Off,I purchased this computer not expecting much for $100 except for it to work. Windows began crashing wihin the first week. I asked for a return authorization. Hurrican Sandy hit my area pretty hard and I did not have power and eventually could not inhabit my home and was not able to process the return quickly. I emailed and explained the problem and heard nothing back. Windows crashed completely and the computer is useless unless I wish to to spend $175 purchasing a copy of Windows and installing the appropriate drivers that should have been installed in the first place so this wouldn't have happened. You got your money and knowingly offered a defective product. Way to do business.
5,Amazing....,One of the most real and intense looks into the tender underbelly of LA's skidrow. Pras Michael and executive producer Jeremy Goldstein should be honored for their unique vision and relentless courage shown in the filming of this project.
4,Skid Row,"Eye-opening documentary about homelessness in Los Angeles. From a bird's-eye view, grammy winner Pras gives a first-hand account of a situation of violence and desperation within a forgotten population of American society."
5,A great series,This series is the best one i have ever read i read all the spy girl books and they all make you want to run to the store and buy the whole series so buy them all and read them in order this one was my favorite
4,"all over the map, in a good way.","this new compilation from ghostly expands on its predecessor by having 2 discs split into more pop-like tracks (though none of them are quite like what youd hear on the radio) and more ambient ones. despite being all over the place genre-wise, though, it retains a surprising amount of coherence. the best 'avant pop' tracks are from mobius band and outputmessage, and the best ambient ones are by tim hecker and cepia. but really there's something here for pretty much everyone..it's a good overview of a solid label."
1,i got fooled again,heard two fantastic songs on Pandora and decided to take a shot and buy the whole 2CD album. What a deception!
5,Jersey hasn't help the Packers do any better.,"I had the intent of watching the Packers win this 2010 season, instead, they've done the opposite as of late. My only condolence is this fantastic jersey!"
3,Pretty limited,"When I read this, I was hoping for a biblical explanation for the pain and suffering that many of us endure. What this is, however, is a series of essays from a conference in response to the theocentric (i.e., CS Lewis) version of what pain and suffering are and how they should be interpreted from the Bible. In other words, an academic exercise aimed at a limited audience. Even so, there are some good insights here, but it is not meant for those who are trying to find meaning in current, real-life pain."
2,USC Sweatshirt,"The sweatshirt seemed to have a weird fit. The neck hole was so small it was hard to get on. Then the bottom was so narrow and the top was relatively wide. It just didn't fit, so I sent it back."
5,"Challenging, But Easy To Follow","I bought this DVD never expecting the results I got: my legs are toned, the salutation part is very aerobic and it really stretches my spine and abs. A great workout!A Note on The Seller: I wouldn't buy this DVD from InnerSelf Market, the DVD they sold me is defective and they don't have a customer service that returned my written messages. They don't list a phone number either."
3,Very Advanced,I am in very good shape and find most intermediate practices to be fairly easy but this one is definetly far advanced. If your new/intermediate do not bother even trying this and that is not meant to be a challenge. Some of the poses I really enjoy and find dynamic but their are some that are just really intense. I believe I'm looking for more of a flowing power yoga that strengthens muscle and constitutes a workout (which this obviously does) but without breaking a wrist. I'm sure the hard core yogi will jump on this review but this practice is definetly not intermediate and already assumes you've mastered more challenging positions rather than being instructive. I would recommend this to the person who is looking for an advanced practice to further their poses rather than someone wanting to learn them.
2,Love the poster...,"I love the poster (you know, the famous one with the hundreds of poses), but the DVD is sorely lacking. I am an experienced yogi with a daily practice of Hatha Vinyasa, Yin, Ashtanga, and Kundalini, however I found this very hard to follow because of his heavy accent. The sequencing and pace didn't appeal to me, either."
3,Thorough historical perspectives on urban regrowth in major cities,"This is a very comprehensive historical review of urban regrowth in major U.S. cities. The author gives sometimes too detailed histories of what happened as formerly neglected areas rebuilt and reclaimed their glory as livable urban neighborhoods. By the stories chosen, it is obvious that the author does not subscribe to the government do it all model of urban regrowth - instead, he focuses on how cities can enable developers and groups to rebuild their cities house by house, block by block.I do wish the author had included more best practices & guidelines for how others can learn from the successes of the cities described. As is, it seems focused too highly on giving the historical story, and less as a cogent synthesis of step-by-step urban renewal."
3,"Plays SCDG Disks, But Poor Build Quality","The CAVS players are the only ones that can play the Super CD+G karaoke format that can contain a MASSIVE number of songs on each disk. The build quality is, unfortunately, quite poor. I have already had to replace the super-pathetic remote TWICE at $34 a pop. The unit cannot output digital audio and analog audio at the same time. The karaoke functions work ONLY in analog mode. So if you want karaoke functions AND digital audio for watching DVDs (which most people WILL want), you have to go through a very cumbersome procedure every time you want to switch -- a BIG pain."
5,Excellent album,"This is an outstanding album. These guys rock, and they do it with taste and tantalization. Fine melodies, adventurous chord changes, excellent sense of musical ebb and flow, and a flair for ornamentation in the psychedelic style. Very very pleasing to the ear. Why does Minneapolis generate so many good bands? Keep up the good work."
3,Too Dark and Different,"If you like other Honeydogs albums, this is probably not anything like you would expect. It is not country, it is not really the same kind of rock as other albums, it is just dark. There is no better way to really describe it. Adam seems kind of distant in it unlike the rest, it is one that you can mostly sing with your eyes closed in a dark room, you know? It unfortunately is not one that I keep in my cd player (except maybe just ""Freakshow"" on loop, that is the best) like their prior efforts, but it is a decent listen. I would recommend it as I would any Honeydogs cd, but I would recommend a few others before it. Sorry guys."
4,Nice boots but are sized too big,"I love these boots, They are of good quality but about 1 size too big. If you are going to order these, go down a whole size"
3,Define sketches,"I thought this book would be drawings about old Sacramento. Instead, the sketches refer to short articles which are interesting, but not what I expected or wanted. Bought through an Amazon merchant, whose service was ideal."
3,vineyard,"This book is filled with information some good some a little over the top. It assumes you already know all about vineyards and skips over a lot of basics. I woul recomend this book to someone who is already very knowledgable in the field, not a beginner or dreamer!"
3,Not much cushion,"Shoes look fine, but don't plan to walk any distance in them -- thin sole and thin insole."
5,Donna Jackson is Superb!,"Well I might be a bit biased since my daughter Lauren is featured on pages 26-27 of this book. I can't tell you how incredible Donna was to work with. She contact us to ask if we would allow our daughter to be used in her upcoming book, IN YOUR FACE: THE FACTS ABOUT YOUR FEATURES. We were thrilled and honored. She did a wonderful job and has shown a lot of compassion in writing this book! Thank you Donna, for allowing us to be a part of it.-Sharon"
2,There are better places to start for serious beginners,"This book, while well-intentioned, is not the best guide for a new woodworker. Somehow the authors lost sight of their target audience (I mean, why call it ""for serious beginners"" if you're not going to present your material for that group?). A better book by far, whether you are a beginner or more experienced in woodworking, is The Complete Manual of Woodworking by Albert Jackson, et al. Jackson's book is twice as big, has many more illustrations, many more resources for virtually the same money. And it will always be there, with reference material and good solid guidance. This book has a few projects but really does not deliver on helping the beginner, serious or not, become more adept at woodworking."
3,Serious means buying stuff that you may never use,"I originally reviewed this in 1999 and this an update to my original review. The Title of this book is misleading. By ""Serious"" the authors mean that you're willing to spend big bucks and buy all the equipment and setup your workshop as you learn. Well, since you're a ""beginner"" what if you decide that woodworking is not for you after all? Well, if you use this books' approach, you'll be stuck with thousands of dollars of power tools. If you already have some woodworking experience you may not agree with the authors approach and techniques. This book makes an interesting addition to your library, but it's not a comprehensive treatise on woodworking by any means."
5,Excellent book,"This book is great. It covers several aspects of heraldry (history, battlefield, heralds, tournaments, rules, positioning, meaning of designs etc.) without being overwhelming for children. I have used this book with my art therapy students, and my sister has used it with her students with art class...all the students loved it. Even those who can't read can get alot from the book as illustrations are excellent. I highly recommend. Ages 6-adult...I have even used this book to design a shield for myself. For those interested in other sources...Heraldic Design by Hubert Allcock is also a great sourcebook."
3,Good For Kids,"I bought this to assist me in making medieval knight shields and design coats of arms to paint onto adult knight tunics. The images and stencils are way too small for adult size tunics let alone shields. The book is perfect for my 8 yr old, so that is what I will be using it for. There were good illustrations and ideas that I used and the history on how and why certain images were used as crests was very fascinating. Would recommend for the 8-14 yr ages."
1,Too basic and outdated,"When the description says ""beginner"", it means it. Most of the book is dedicated to topics geared toward someone who has not yet purchased a digital camera. I was expecting something to teach me how to get the most from the one I have already bought. Plus, given the rapid improvements in technolgy, a lot of the comments he makes are now incorrect or irrelevant (digital SLR's start at $4000, for instance)."
5,Wireless Adapter for Xbox or Xbox 360,This is a more affordable option compared to the new USB Xbox 360 wireless adapter; if you dont mind using the ethernet adapter on the Xbox 360 and the fact that it will sit on top of the unit and a diffrent color(Black) and a external power supply.Installation was a brezze and straight forward just connect to your wireless access point and you are done.If you are looking to save a few bucks and are looking to ave the same funtionality this is your best bet because it's made by Microsoft and it is fully compatible with both units.I hope that this review helps you on making a decision on your purchase.
2,"works, but needs a disc.","The main problem I had with this thing is that I never had the disc to set it up with.It's pretty stupid that they didn't include a webinterface on this thing, luckily I was able to flash it with a new firmware. The alternative firmware has support for wpa as well.For directions on how to update it, just do a search for ""[Microsoft] Hack MN-740 to tal DGL-3420 firmware"".Good luck!"
3,You get what you pay for,"This is a good little device that really does work quite well with the Xbox 360, but not so well with some wireless routers. I ran into a lot of compatibility issues (I have a Belkin N Wireless router), despite the significant amount of research I put into this. After countless hours of troubleshooting, I did eventually manage to get it to work.Another con is that the technology is very outdated. It is not capable of 802.11n, and cannot connect to WPA secure networks.Pros: cheap, works, good signal rangeCons: outdated technology, has its own power cord (which some may see as a pro, but for me, less cords the better)Overall, this is a good cheap alternative. It worked for me for about year until I upgraded to the new Xbox 360 S. If you have the extra cash to spend, save yourself the trouble and go withXbox 360 Wireless Network Adapter A/B/G & N Networks."
5,xbox adaptor,"other than being a pain to set up, this works great and is cheaper than the newer version"
5,GREAT INVESTMENT,This works 100% with Xbox 360 save your self 50[..] and get this old school marvel !!!
5,Works great with original XBOX,I connected this to my XBOX (not 360) and it installed with ease and has worked like a charm since installation.
1,Didn't work for my 360,I'm somewhat technically savvy and I could not get this to work for my 360. I bought the newer (360) adapter and that worked without a problem.
2,Not for X-box 360,"Product didn't work on my x-box 360. Spent 1/2 hour with Microsoft Tech/customer support and they were no help. I assume it will work with a regular x-box.It was easy to return with Amazon, a painless and easy transaction."
3,MN740 ADAPTER - HELP,"HELP - I got this for my son to connect to his Xbox 360 and he cannot get it to work. Can someone please send all the instructions so we can set it up. As stated, the disk did not work, but he can't seem to get to the wireless settings."
1,Doesn't work with all internet services,"After reading all the reviews for this product, we decided to purchase this item over the 360 version. However, it would not connect to our wireless system. I don't really know what the problem was, but my husband tried connecting it several times. He finally got too frustrated after an hour or so and went to Game Stop to buy the 360 version. We had no problem connecting with that one. So, I'm just warning that it may not be as ""easy"" as some said it was."
1,Xbox adapter,What a waste. Would not work with our gateway network. After many attempts (including trying to contact Microsoft and Xbox for info/assistance) we gave up in frustration and bought the higher priced newer adapter. The new one works fine but this one would have required that we reconfigure our home network in order to use. The error messages informed us that we could find the info online but could not locate (and I am a student in knowledge management!). We also sent it back to Microsoft stating that it was unusable and they just sent it right back without any explanation. Poor product and poor service.
5,Xbox wireless network adapter,It's a network adapter for my xbox so I can play games online. Works perfectly!
3,xbox 360 wireless network adapter,"The product worked great but only after using the old Xbox to set the parameters, the xbox 360 couldn't do this."
2,No WPA PSK problem!,"Since there is no WPA PSK (at least without flashing firmware back to a DLink adapter, this seems to be a DLink adapter with microsoft firmware that does not have WPA!!!) it's a bad deal, current wifi networks should use WPA. WEP is an old technology and not very good.help!"
2,WPA2 incompatible.,"Unless you are using the obsolete WEP encryption standard, this wont work on your network. There is no firmware update available to make it so that it is compatible with WPA or WPA2 without completely removing its ability to work with the 360.So unless you are willing to switch your network to WEP encryption (a decision which depends on how paranoid you are for the most part), then you will have to purchase the one made by Microsoft or route your 360 through your laptop or PC (which is fairly easy to do)."
5,great price,Great adapter and great price. Be sure to not use the disc with xbox360..Needs to state that clearly. We thought it did not work because we used it then went back and redid it and it works excellently!!!
4,"Not completely seamless, but more than workable.","I'd been hooking up my 360 with an ethernet cable to my PC for a while, which I'd set up to share its wireless connection -- can you believe someone sells instructions for doing that on eBay? Not exactly rocket science, people -- when Amazon pointed me to this item. It's been perfectly functional since I got it. The only hassle is:(1) I have to unplug the power cable when I want to turn it off, and(2) it only connects after I run the Test Connection utility after each power-up. (Settings panel > Network > Test XBox LIVE Connection) This may be because I've set my 360 with a static IP address locally, so I can forward the XBL ports to it on the router.But to get rid of the cable running down the hall to my PC, it's worth it."
4,XBOX Wireless adapter works on SBOX 360,This thing works awesome on the XBOX 360 and saved myself a good chunk of change too. Just don't insert the cd. XBOX 360 and your computer will do the work for you.
2,blood on the snow,"This early Stirling novel displays many of the things about his writing that critics have found fault with: the extremely violent and sex-crazed heroine reappears in *Saber and Shadow* in a more positive light. This is a post-nuclear holocaust tale which is a part of the ""Fifth Millennium"" series which Stirling created with Shirley Meier and Karen Wehrstein.As with many of Stirling's novels, an extremely militaristic culture takes on peaceful craftspeople and, of course, wins. I have not seen the earlier version of this, and this is a review of the later revision.Stirling's fans will enjoy this; others might avoid it."
1,poorly written,Not worth reading. The plot is typical Stirling but the writing is poor.I'm surprised it was published. (extra words to reach 20)
5,Anne Firor Scott Is Right On Target!,"In this book, Anne Firor Scott takes an in-depth look at the Woman Suffrage movement in the South. Scott is the first historian to write extensively on the subject of woman suffrage in the South. Later historians either agree or disagree with her work. This book is one of her best works. She gives the reader a good understanding of why woman suffrage was not so widely embraced by southern women. Her study looks at women's lives in the South before and after the Civil War. She explains the hardships and responsibilities of antebellum women, and the deprivations these women faced after the fall of the Confederacy. YOU CANNOT STUDY WOMAN SUFFRAGE IN THE SOUTH WITHOUT READING THIS BOOK! It is a classic work, and I highly recommend it!"
2,Half and Half,"This book really did it. It put me to sleep so fast. The reason why I gave it 2 stars was because the first few chapters did give a quite good introduction on cryptography. I don't know how I got fool into buying this book. Oh yes, it was because of the 5-stars rating I saw on others' comments."
5,PICTURES IN MUSIC,"DAVID HAS DONE IT AGAIN. AS WITH IN THE WAKE ON THE WIND HE HAS TAKEN A STORY AND MADE IT VISABLE THROUGH HIS MUSIC. HIS ANCIENT VOICES, SPIRIT WIND, AND SPIRIT OF THE CANYON ARE OTHER PROOFS OF HIS FANTASTIC MUSICIAL INSIGHT AND TALENT. THIS IS ANOTHER CD TO TRULY ENJOY."
3,Not as good as most other Arkenstone efforts,"This CD is good and is a reasonable addition to your music library if you are a fan of David Arkenstone's works. However, the effort is not as engaging or lively as most of his other efforts - - regardless of how big a fan you are. If you don't expect too much, you won't be too disappointed. If you've never experienced any of David's music before, start with one of his many other CD's instead."
2,Hard to program,It was very hard to program and when i did it stopped working properly within weeks....look into getting another one
5,Sure is Nice,"To be able to use a keyless entry fob on a used, older model automobile. I bought my son a 2000 Mercury Cougar as his first car. We received only a single ignition/door lock key at purchase. We bought the clicker, received promptly, followed the included instructions, and now have a quick and secure method for unlocking and locking the car. Thanks guys, this would have been a pain in the neck without the internet, and of course, Amazon. Thanks"
5,Essential Information,"Women want their men to show their feelings, be in touch with their emotions and be able to talk about them. But women do not know how to deal with that kind of man! We have taken for granted that men will put their own emotions aside to be there for us in a supportive manner whenever we feel the need to let our emotions loose - which it pretty much any time we want. We act as if we have carte blanche with our emotions and though we say we want men to express theirs - we are SO unpracticed in the role of putting our emotions aside and being the supportive partner. Above all, this book illustrated this dynamic so clearly to me. I am still practicing being there for my partner, who I am so blessed to be able to say is in touch with his emotions. Thanks to this book I understand what I am working towards and how he struggles against society's expectations in his quest to become a more whole person. Recommended reading for all!"
4,Not the Author's best.,As a fan I was a little disappointed. I felt the Manson theme and American setting was too open to allow the author to fully exercise his talents.For me Dibdin excels at intricate plot lines in enclosed universes and delicious ironic twists of fate.Still a more accomplished novel than most in the field though not as viscerally gripping as some of the American writers.
4,Chapter Grabber,"Dibdin knows how to capture your attention. He definitely knows how to draw you in. Each chapter leaves you wanting to read ""just one more"" as when you guiltily reach for ""just one more"" of your favorite sins. Felt the book sagged near the end-- too much quick tidying- but even the ending was unique. It ends with a bang."
2,"Well written, terrible plot","Dibdin is an excellent writer and his prose is even stronger in a genre (crime writing) not normally known for that quality. I'd almost recommend reading Dark Specter for that reason alone because there aren't any other reasons to read it.The plot, on the other hand, is contrived and more often than not predictable. Dibdin does a pathetic job convincing his reader of a number of unlikely coincidences that allow him to take an eery tale of cults in modern-day society and wrap everything up in a tidy Hollywood ending. Where the last line of the book should be one of the creepiest you've ever read, it's as unlikely and unbelievable as the rest of the novel because a number of key characters remain underdeveloped.Skip this one."
2,Disappointing,"I've read a few Michael Dibdins lately because Ruth Rendell (aka Barbara Vine) recommends him. He can be an excellent writer, but this book was pedestrian in both writing and plot. I saw Los's solution to ""How can a just God allow terrible things to happen to good people"" very early on, and read to the end only to see if I was right. The main character was naive to the point of idiocy, thinking he could pay a social visit to what was obviously a cult leader. I give it two stars only because 1 star should be reserved for those who truly can't write."
1,Very disappointing!,"The quality of this book was substandard at best. The photos were grainy and difficult to see. The writing was stilted and unimaginative. The book is self published which may explain the publisher's positive review. (...) Its too bad, because there are few books out there that help make the Great Depression real for school age children."
1,Terrible,"The acting is dreadful, the actions ridiculous. For anybody who has been in Himalaya, in high altitude it is so ridiculous it's embarrassing ! The producer and film director should have made it in locations closer to reality. ( I have been in high altitude many times, Himalaya and Andes)"
2,Terrible Acting,"This movie was the worst acting I've ever seen. They took a tragic year and put it over the top with unbeliveable fight seen at 26,000 feet. Your lucky to move up their. The cimm and everest pictures were great but the acting was so bad it was almost laughable."
4,"Excellent story, well told.","This story focusses on Deanna Troi, telepathy, and religious beliefs. It is well-crafted, thoughtful, and interesting, with interesting characters and a viable plot. There isn't much action, although there is some, and there certainly is plenty of drama. An exceptionally good story, almost if not quite up to the five star level."
1,Boring psychobabble.,This book was about as unexciting as it gets. Anyone who likes action in books won't enjoy this one. With Deanna getting attacked by something so lame and boring I've already forgotten what it was. Some psychological claptrap. Basically the plot had a very plot device feel with Deanna as the main charater. Who I like to see but not read about.
4,"Jaguar XJ6, 1968-1986 by John Haynes","Essential to the XJ 6/12 owner even if you've gotten the (pricey!) factory Jaguar manual. A little awkward as the Series III info is in a supplemental chapter, necessitating a lot of flipping back and forth."
2,Not one of her best.,"This novel is so depressing! Amelia is physically abused by her father and mentally abused by King through most of the book. I've never hated a lead man in a book so much. King is one of the most dense characters ever! I can't stand him! Ughhh! He is so distasteful! Amelia was weak through most of the book and just got on my nerves. I guess it was understandable because she was being abused but her loyalty to her abusive father was just sick! King almost gets her beaten to death and that is sooo UNFORGIVABLE in my eyes. I wish I never picked this book up! It made me cry because I was so angry and felt so sorry for Amelia. It wasn't a romance. It was a pity fest. Yet I had to give it 2 stars cause no matter how much I hate the book, it did make me feel something and I did like her brother Quinn and his story."
3,"Opteka R72 Infrared Filter - Not quite R72, more like R90?","I received this filter as a birthday gift and set out to experiment immediately! The filter is great if you like black and white infrared pictures, but its not great for retaining a blue sky and completely white foliage... It seems to me that the cut-off frequency is a lot higher than advertised, more like 830-900nm, not suitable for color infrared... I think that this filter is an equivalent to the Hoya R90 filter and NOT the R72... Disappointed with the color IR effect with this filter, I made my own filter with 3 pieces of Lee C181 Blue gels and 2 Roscoe 27 Red gels sandwiched between 2 pieces of glass and fixed inside a custom home-made filter housing..."
3,Not like an IR camera.,"Filter fits and works well, though not like a true IR camera, but it does give some neat effects."
3,IR filter requires bright light,"Normal, indoor lighting probably won't have enough IR to use this, nor will an overcast day. In such cases, a tripod and a 10+ second exposure would be necessary.However, on a bright day outside, this is great. It gives a whole new view to the world to see what reflects IR and what doesn't. For example, green plants show up as bright white."
4,what a hoot !,"This is a fabulous romp...the sets ! the fashions ! Lana Turner's sculpted hair ! but most of all, the refreshing innocence of it.Lana Turner is simply marvelous here, and Ricardo Montalban, looking hunk-o-rama good, is even better. Incredibly delightful is Louis Calhern's ""Grandfather""...a deliciously writen and beautifully acted part.The musical selections are wonderful (they look so gorgeous dancing the samba together !) and there are many extremely amusing scenes.If you want to escape into a time when things were simple, sweet and fun, this will do it !"
5,ricardo is very handsome a real hunk to fall in love with,"seeing the handsome ricardo as roberto i can undestand why lana is so in love with him. ricardo is areal hunk adreamcome true for any woman.some of his scenes are unforgetable,the way he kisses nora in the stable the wayhe dancesin the fiesta and how gorgeous he looks when nora come to visit him while he is working out doors to fix a .abridge. ricardo is naked to torax and his phisiqus is breath taking . iwarmly recomend to become acquainted with that latin hunk."
1,Must see,I ordered the Mermaid Gold Shower Head and needed a part that did not come with the shower head. Ive been calling this Zoe Indusstries for days and cannot get an answer and no one will call me back. I have sent emails and no reply back. I'm suspicious????
4,Nice for a gift,"I bought this as a gift, and was pleased with its appearance aesthetically. Its not an amazing watch by movado standards, but its decent. The gold and silver work well together.As far as the size of the bracelet, I tested it and it fit me fine. I am a larger male, with ~8"" wrist, so I'd imagine that most won't have to buy and additional links.Can't really say much more."
1,Poor life span,"I bought a 512mb model u10 right after if came out and after about 8 months began to have problems with it deleting songs on its own, or when I would delete them the songs name would stay in my playlist and would stop playing whenever it came to the song. I have another u10 which is the 1GB model and after about 8 months it is doing the same thing, I wouldn't advise anyone to buy an iRiver product and if you have one take it back now because it will self destruct. IRiver isn't the only company who seems to have problems with their MP3 players lifespan, average life of a much more expensive IPod is only 18 months. Until someone steps in and insists these electronic companies make a reliable product I am sticking with the cheaper products that services like Napster and Urge offer."
3,"This is not an ipod rip off, but it's not a good value either","The guy saying this is an ipod rip off is an idiot. How this is in any way like an ipod because you move in directions to select things is beyond me. How else would you choose? To say it rips off ipods, then say it sucks because they dont steal the click wheel is just stupid. Anyway, this thing is pretty cool and sounds good, but is just not worth the money. Simple as that. A nano really is a better value."
1,Most certainly DOES NOT rule!,"Ok so this little player in concept looked good. However just because the compnay says its has great video, does not mean it does. The video is blocky, sound is poor and this long battery life the manufacturer is saying, just isnt there. I took this back and bought a video iPod and was very happy.I should have known anytime you see a ""kid"" saying it ""rules"" it most certainly does not rule. A child would have nothing to compare this to and therefore would think something this small was just too cool for school. Im sorry but it really is a piece of absolute garbage."
5,Excellent device...,"iriver u10 is an excellent device and has features that no other mp3 player can have all together.Some of the features I love:-built-in radio (ipod or similar doesn't have)-record sound/radio/linein directly to mp3 (amazing..., can record hours and hours...)-video-connect as a usb storage and you have the freedom to directly copy/rename/delete any file in it as its another folder in your computer! And you are not bound to an application such as itunes...-have different settings for song listings (such as list artists, albums, titles) BUT my favorite is that, it allows also you to browse the filename lists (not available in ipod) as in your computer. This is best if your mp3 tags are not well organized!!-Memory is flashram, so no need for extra careful handling-and finally; battery life is really long...only problem might be the capacity (1gb). If you are the one that want to carry all his audio in a device, go for a hdd based device... Otherwise, enjoy u10..."
5,iriver u10 is great,"I was a little skeptical when i ordered but my u10 works flawlessly,sounds great,and the battery is awesome.If you're looking for an mp3 player with limited storage then this is the one.I have an ipod nano 1gb, i prefer the u10 in all categories."
4,20 months +,"This is my longest lasting mp3. I've had over 10 mp3s never lasting me more than 4 months so I'm amazed that this one lasted me so long.Pros: love that I can record songs on the radio, scroll through pictures, skim through notesCons: Can't play games while listening to music; downloading the program needed to drag songs is annoying although if you stay with the same laptop, it won't bother you as much; three bars of battery lasts me a long time, but once 2 bars hit, I know I only have too short of a time left"
1,For Display Only,This toy is so fragile it broke just opening the package. Don't buy this unless you want to leave it in the package and never take it out.
3,Funni face,"The whole statue is ok overall, but the face is not what i spected or ever wanted. Im only 60% happy with it. Do they make very small paper bags?"
3,This isn't a book for those seeking only light reading.,"Another title for this book might be ""Everything You Ever Wanted to Know about the Sacrament of Reconciliation."" It's all here, especially the history of its origin and development since the days of the early church. It is not an easy book to read but a necessary one to read for anyone deeply interested in this Catholic sacrament. I came to the book lukewarm on the sacrament and went away convinced of its necessity on a regular (not just annual) basis for devoted Catholics who wish to deepen their faith, especially in how it relates to their everyday lives. Since I am a book editor, I didn't rate the book any higher than I did simply because the author's style is often obscure, difficult, or simply redundant. I also found the book poorly organized, minus any strong sense of overall cohesiveness."
5,Great classroom help,I love this product for my Spanish Classroom for 1st and 2nd grades. I did need to get it lamenated to have it last the whole school year though.
3,"Gadgets are fun, but be careful","My son enjoys the car a lot and likes to push the buttons, etc. However, just tonight he was playing with the phone and the ""cord"" got wrapped around his finger and then wedged underneath the base of the phone, hurting his finger. It happened in about 5 seconds. I would recommend either not using the cord or making it so short that this can't happen. His little finger is still red!"
4,"Lots of fun, but one problem","I purchased this for my 8 month old son. He really does like it and it seems to keep him occupied. There is one major flaw. The seat does not rotate very well. He certainly can't do it on his own. I end up spinning him around which kind of defeats the purpose have having a swivel seat. I believe if there were more rollers and they were larger the problem would be solved. So far so good other than that. Took me about a half an hour to put together. And it is so cute! I drive a VW, so I just love the ""bug"" design. And the vibrating ""start and shift"" is hysterical. Very cute."
5,great buy,"i'm very pleased with the jitter buggy. it was easy to put together, and very entertaining. my 4 yr old told me she wishes she was little so she could have one. 4 month old loves all the music and sounds. the jitter buggy is a great buy."
4,Love It,"My 5 1/2 month old son loves his jitterbuggy. It definately keeps him occupied for longer periods of time. I received this as a gift at my baby shower. Since my son is very tall (90%tile) he started using it @ 3 months. Like other reviewers we used a yellow pages to help him. Now at almost 6 months he has figured out most of the buttons, using the radio the most. He pushed the buttons on the radio, immediately looks up and waits for someone to dance.The only drawback is thatit is not a walker. Now my son's legs are stronger he wants to stand all the time. If this were a walker, it would be the perfect toy."
5,Love it! Love it!,"My son was 5 1/2 months when I had first put him the Jitter Buggy. He was so intrigued by the many different sounds it made. He really like pushing the radio and horn. I put him in the Buggy while he watches his Baby Einstein video. He loves it. He recently starting spin around to pay with the back of the car. I definitely think everyone should invest in one. It's cute, durable and most importantly entertaining!"
4,How Cute!,"My son started using this adorable car at 5 months and loves it. He gets so excited honking the horn, turning the left signal, and the radio. It's funny seeing how much fun he has in it. I also catch him staring at his reflection in the safe mirrior. The only concern is that sometimes he gets a little to excited and hits his head on the stearing wheel. He also wants to eat the stearing wheel since he is teathing."
5,My son loves it!,"My son loves this thing. He loves to bounce in it and honk the horn. He's always honking the horn before he's even completely in it. He also loves to look at himself in the mirror and since there are 2 mirrors, one in the front and one in the back, he can always see himself. He really hasn't had any trouble turning around in it. We are very pleased with this toy!"
3,CHILD GET'S BORED!!,"This product is good for about a month. After a while my son was bored with it. First, it has him confined and he looks uncomfortable in it. The only way he would stay in that seat is if I was feeding him or if I had him in front of the TV. This product did not distract him for a long span of time."
3,"entertaining, but not mobile","When I read about this item the first time - it said something that led me to believe that the wheels actually worked and the unit could be taken off of the base at some point to roll around the house in. It does NOT do this to my surprise. I also thought that with the size of the box it came it - it could have been assembled for us. I had one unhappy camper watching me for the 45+ minutes it took for me to put the darn thing together. And, as for moving it from room to room - it is not an easy thing to do - it falls apart no matter which part you try to pick it up from. It's not a bad toy, but not what I was hoping for."
2,the jitterbug,This is a really nice toy. My son of 7 months loves it. But I think it should have been made a little easier to put together.
3,Just okay,"My son hated this item from the first. He hated being confined, he now loves it at 13 mths but only for a maximum of 20 mins. I gave it to the daycare since they might need it more."
4,A good starting point.,"This was the first book I read on the subject of Tequilla, however not the best. The color illustrations and proposed tequilla-based drinks are great. However, more consideration and depth is given to tequilla history, manufacturing processes, and culture in ""The Book of Tequila : A Complete Guide"". If you intend to further your exploration of tequillas in the SF Bay area, you might consider visiting Fiesta Del Mar in Mountain View, the Blue Agave, or Maya in San Francisco (2nd & Folsom). These restaurants have excellent tequilla menus from which to select."
2,Frank but not enlightening,"Having just read two wonderful Proust-haunted books (HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE by Alan de Botton and DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS by Andrei Makine), I thought to round off with Phyllis Rose's take on the magnetic author. What a disappointment! Where Proust convinces us of the ephemeral verities of life, Rose (a writer and critic here-to-fore admired) assures merely of the shallowness, the superficialities of a self-centered ""literary"" existence. Frank without being enlightening, quotidean to the point of banality, Rose shocks the reader by portraying in what seems an ungenerous if not viperous spirit all friends and loved ones but her mother, whose endurable qualities rise like cream to the top of the froth. Maybe what sets the teeth on edge are grammatical errors (I/me mistakes) in three early chapters and a late one. Still, one wonders why this author needed to publish, let alone write, a book so disadvantageous to herself and others."
1,"shallow, lazy and narcissistic memoir","From Woolf to Dickens and Carlyle to a wonderful essay on Little Black Sambo's author to Josephine Baker, Phylis Rose's objects of consideration have always been profoundly significant. We used to read her books because they told us about the world. But now we learn only about Phyllis Rose's world, and it isn't the least bit appealing, or interesting or even revelatory. Rose has lost her way completely. Her early books expressed a kind of insight, albeit in a perpetually arrogant and smug tone, that is completely absent from this book. An author in search of a subject. Perhaps this is her last book."
1,Nope!,"I have nothing to add to the other 1-star votes, other than the 1-star vote itself.The saving grace, I suppose, is that Rose herself provides a perfect example of the snobs Proust mocks repeatedly in ISOLT. Simply bad."
2,A year of not reading Phyllis Rose,"Ms Rose is without a doubt a talented writer, but her work here is tediously self-indulgent and trite and sheds very little light on Proust, or indeed on his effect on her. Give it a miss and read the master! I don't think I'll be visiting Ms Rose's other work anytime soon..."
1,A Proust Character Come to Life!,"There are characters in Proust that are so cartoonishly shallow, vain, parochial, and lacking in self-knowledge that one laughs in spite of thinking no such person could exist in real life.Phyllis Rose proves that such people do exist.Of course it is possible that her book is a satiric fiction disguised as autobiography. If so, it is not funny enough. (Learn from Proust!) If this really is an autobiography, it is surprising that an author would allow publication of something that makes her look so ridiculous."
2,Self indulgence masked by literary allusions,"I was so excited to purchase and read this book. I loved Rose's critical biography of Virginia Woolf and now her clarity and insights would be extended to her own life and to Proust. What a disappointment. Rose's candor is amazing, because it reveals a rather shallow and self-satisfied woman. Her use of Proust is quite minimal and superficial. I found no relationship between her life and writing and that of Proust's. Read Proust instead!"
1,you gotta be kidding,"What is the justification for this book?Look, I appreciate the fact that Phyllis Rose may come from a context where people who have negotiated the whole of Proust are scarce as hens' teeth, but that doesn't mean the rest of us do. Among my friends, at least, this achievement isn't so rare: none of us would have been so self-absorbed as to consider the feat book-worthy!Was Rose so taken with herself that this alone was reason for writing an entire book? Sheesh. At least Jacobs' chronicle of his supposedly reading the entire Britannica:The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the Worldwas memorably recorded, while Shea's muddling through the OEDReading the OED: One Man, One Year, 21,730 Pagesat least contained lots of amusement. Rose can offer no insights even remotely comparable to theirs.No wonder there are so many of them available for a penny!"
1,UNKO NO HON,"The book is not well written.Magick is science. Lisiewski's magick isn't science.Lisiewski states that such a thing called ""sling shot effect"" occurs when one fails in evocation. Sling show effect is an effect where he claims that negative thing such as losing money and friendship occurs after receiving lumpsome of money from some source after a fail evocation took place. I personally do not know what kind of spirts he has been dealing with but such a thing as slingshot effect is bogus. The only reason negative thing occured to Lisieski is because of his own inherent balance of karma and the evocating the spirit was just a trigger to releasing his own karmic debt. So such a law as slingshot effect is not concrete.Lisewski also needs to be more flexible in his thinking."
3,FALCON PRESS ALERT,"Okay. The author's main thesis is that your evocations don't work because you have to follow the directions in the original grimoires EXACTLY. If you mix stuff up from different systems, it won't work. That's why you just get psychological reactions INSIDE yourself instead of some actual presence OUTSIDE of your magical circle.The author (who for all we know could just be a pseudonym of Hyatt and Black, but let's assume he exists) presents a particularly ""easy"" grimoire with a detailed commentary on how to use it (though you need access to a lot of Catholic implements--Holy water, etc. to make it work.)This is interesting reading certainly, particularly compared to the droves of magic books published by Llewellyn.Does it work? Alas, I'm only an armchair magician. I can't help you there."
1,Power at a Price,"Does the ""old style"" magical system advocated by Lisiewski work? Yes, I can personally attest that it does. But is it worth it? I can also attest that it does not. This style of magical evocation requires pact-making, explicitly or implicitly, which rarely ends well for the magician. I suggest a much more spiritually balanced approach to evocation, such as that found in the work of Franz Bardon."
4,A Little Bit more,"I enjoyed this book very much, having gotten much from the magical axioms and conjurations that I was able to use in my work. This book is unlike others I have read or used and is a valuable asset to me. I am giving it only 4 stars however as I believe the author could have done a more in depth job with the axioms. I did not find his writing style to be as hard as some reviewers here said. In fact, it was refreshing to have to think beyond the obvious which is what he makes you do. And do. And do. But still, I think the axioms could have been treated more completely and so the 4 stars."
3,Faberge Drawings,If you are looking for drawings this book has Wigstrom drawings. He only produced a small part of the Faberge objects. He was not the main designer and artist. There are a few small photos of actual items. If you want to see the range of Faberge items this is not the book for you.
4,A beguiling original ahead of it's time,"All of the reviews positive and one negative sum this amazing book up pretty well. You can easily get lost in the stories within stories until you forget where you began but that's part of it's intention. He's combined so many elements, gothic horror, mysticism, cabbala, mathematics, duels, romantic pursuits, revenge, sin and redemption and more so the book has a kaleidoscopic feel to it. Deceptively simple narration with thought provoking content, the book shares similarities with Sufi stories, myths, fables, Poe and much more. The Goya on the cover was an excellent choice."
3,An interesting multi-layered story in 17th-century Europe.,"This novel is the very definition of ""multi-layered"". Ostensibly the story of a Spanish knight on his travels, it rapidly becomes a tree of stories as the characters he encounters tell their stories, and the characters in those stories tell their own stories, and so on, many layers deep. Nevertheless, there is a coherent theme and exposition that probes at faith, mysticisim, and systems of power. The layers of storytelling suffer from a consistent writing style that makes distinguishing them difficult - all the narrators speak in approximately the same way, regardless of the time, place, or their station.Interesting, but somewhat obscure."
3,Almost but not quite,"Almost all the hype is true -- this is a beguiling, Arabian Nights-styled classic, one of those obscurities you pick up by accident and that becomes a lifelong favorite. Obviously, Potocki's long novel has greatness in it, but so much depends on the translation. In this case, translator Ian Maclean has opted for a serious, elegant style that ignores the fact that it's a comic novel. It's a serious offense, and it's all the more glaring when you compare it to Elizabeth Abbot's faithful, entertaining version from 1960. In either case, it must be read, but Maclean's version left me more in admiration of his prose than for his overall effectiveness as a co-storyteller with Potocki.Fans of the novel are urged to seek out Has' superb film adaptation, which is available on VHS and DVD."
4,Captivating,"The Early Life Of Jeomie East is a wonderful book. This book is touching, loving, and enlightening. It helps you realize that there is an illness out there that can take hold of your life and completely change your view of it. Jeomie wrote a touching autobiography of her experiences. The photo album portion of this book helps you put faces with names. And the poems and the tributes were touching. I enjoyed it, and I learned so much. Thank you for sharing."
1,not the best,"not as picture very thin stove I then got a cast iron burner propane stove,and this one works good for me"
5,Nice,"Nice item, price was right. One of the legs was missing and called texsport about it. Two days later received 2 new legs. Great customer support"
4,"Great product, wish it had more BTU (heat)","PROS:1. It looks nice and has been the easiest to clean stove I have owned (huge factor since we use it for heavy duty oil-rich spattered food all the time).2. Takes up very little space with its sleek design.3. Looks nice, with a durable matte finish of red color.CONS:1. Very low heat (5,500 BTU max?) so things slowly stew/boil where I expect them to sizzle (in oil).2. Burners are too close to each other so I cannot use both burners simultaneously (unless I use small diameter pots).3. Things are a lot worse on a windy day - negligible heat (however the flames are not too weak in wind, thanks to a clever design). The heat loss from flowing air cannot be compensated from the tiny amount of heat the burners put out."
3,"Compact - Just My Size, but not my color",Can't wait to use my new Texsport Two Burner Propane Stove. I ordered it thinking it would be the color Green like it the photo. The color is Red and that I don't like. I like my campsite camo-style.
5,beautiful book,"Definitely purchase this book if you're a fan of Kilgallen. Lots of photos of her own paintings, as well as installation/shows she exhibited. The book is a work of art itself; it's beautifully made."
2,"Good chess player, very average book","Jaan Ehlvest is a very gifted player. Unfortunately, that doesn't translate into writing a good book. I find the book boring. I give it 2 stars out of respect for the author."
4,"EXCELLENT documentary, but needs remastering","I am impressed with the documentary; it's informative and 100% of the film records wildlife rather than scientists. However, there appears to be no re-mastering, which, at this price, there should be."
1,not for the uk,I was unable to view this DVD on our player as it was not made for this region. I therefore had to return it and I fail to see why it is advertised in the UK. without a warning to that effect.
4,Trippy fun,"Brian writes a thoughtful story of common folk who explore many different political and religious topics, and have a good time doing it. He covers a lot of ground in a short time with what this protagonist thinks and discusses. Lots of fun!"
2,Show gutted without Claire and Becky,"McCleod's daughters was unique for television; it had heart, spirit, and charm. The premise of a group of determined women with a common goal, the development of their characters, their personal growth through life's ups and downs, was fabulous. The first three seasons focused on connections, to family, friends, heritage and the land.The 4th season on is just another tv drama, good at times, but without the same focus on family ties and station life that so engrossed me. I couldn't wait to see all of the Seasons 1 through 3. Although the end of Season 3 was extremely well done - (I cried, and I never cry!) it truly gutted the show. The storyline moved too far away from the initial relationships and rural life, and became too convoluted to be believable."
4,mcleod's daughters,After Claire character was lilled off last season the lost something;they tried to make up for it by bring in more characters;I still in enjoyed to old characters and their story but season 4 was the end for me.
1,McLeod's Daughters Season 4 DVD - unhappy,"I am sure this DVD is just fine. I don't know since I haven't opened it. I bought it as a gift, but the giftee already found the item. I have contacted you regarding return and have heard nothing. Please contact."
5,MCLEOD'S DAUGHTER'S SEASON 4,I HAVE THE WHOLE SET NOW AND LOVE EVERY SEASON. THIS IS A GREAT SERIES. ALL THE DVD'S WORK WONDERFUL AND I SAY BUY IT.
5,Even without Claire....,Still one of the best shows ever created. There's nothing like this on American television.
3,Front door mat-ok,I was looking to replace my marine rope mat i have had for 8 years-thought this was same. My doorway gets very wet and this mathas already started to brown with water stains(4 weeks) It is sturdy mat and better for an entrance that is covered.
5,My Brilliant Career(DVD),"I saw this movie twice in one week years ago.It was the first time I saw Judy Davis.She was then and still is a wonderful actress.The film has a good story&I found it charming,witty,and fun.It does have its serious moments.It is exctremely well done.One of the best of its kind I have seen."
2,Yet another contrarian view,"I wanted to like this film. I really did. Especially after reading the glowing reviews here. But I found it somewhat empty and non-sensical in some aspects. One thing I couldn't understand is why the main protagonist had to go to work as a governess for this poor family when she was living with her rich grandmother. How much money could her father owe this man that her grandmother couldn't pay off the debt for him? I didn't find the romance nor the entire film believable. The cinematography was gorgeous as well as the sets. But that's about all I got out of it, although I admit the second half was better than the first half, but that's still not saying much in my opinion."
1,Ignore the great reviews. Really.,"I have the honor finding and giving great movies to my mother - Anne of Green Gables (Megan Follows), Body and Soul (Kristin Scott Thomas) etc. I'm kicking myself for not reading the low star reviews of this dvd. I give ""My Brilliant Career"" 1 star because it was based on a real book written by a teenager for the amusement of her friends. On the screen the young woman comes off as an ambitionless, vulgar, egotistical dreamer. There is no heroine here, no endearing soul to root for or identify with. It's a terrible adaption. I can't see myself donating the dvd to my local library."
5,For true romantics,"This is simply a beautiful film, bursting with life and creativity--I recommend it to anyone. Don't miss the featurettes on the DVD set, especially the interview with director Gillian Armstrong, recalling how she argued for the film's free-spirited ending (barely imaginable even in the 1970s) and ended up winning the hearts of the audience at the Cannes Film Festival."
1,Hastily written book,I think the writers were more concerned with covering everything in the table of contents and not actually explaining anything.
2,"Lots of paper, little info.","This book is another VB6 help-file rehash. I had high hopes for this book but those were dashed on the jagged rocks of triviality. For a book requiring several trees worth of paper, one would think that something like - how to pass a control array to a procedure would surely be covered! Or perhaps would at least mention how to use the most common controls! No, you won't find that information here. What you will find is a lot of topics covered, a few with good depth and the rest barely mentioned. The format of the book is excellent but the overwhelming majority of the information presented leaves you saying ""I could have got that information from the VB6 help-file!"" I recommend you spend your $40.00 on a different book as this one will be of little use to anyone."
1,Dont waste your money!,"This book was a total waste of hard-earned cash. Upon opening the first chapter it was so full of incorrect information and omissions, it is virtually useless. The instructions for builidng the programs conveniently (!) omit half of the steps. If you are a beginning programmer, you will be totally lost. I own a small library of programming reference books, and this is by far my biggest disappointment."
1,Lost of money!!,"I`m about to learn VB in a class and we`re learning by practising given examples, control by control. The hope that my new bought book will provide me with helpfull hints and tricks was a big disappointment. Instead of a logical and structured approach with a usefull Index, the reader is confused by various articles from different authors, which irritates you much more than they helps. It reminded me to these ""computer books"" like: ""The 1000 hottest tricks for Windows"" by Bill Gates,for just 55$!! -> including the most useless stuff ever mentioned about computers!!Compared to his really brilliant written elder brother: C++ by Robert Lafore, this book is really s..."
1,Look Elsewhere,This book is a huge waste of money and your time. Tried working examples in Chap. 32 to get better understanding of concepts. Unfortunately examples are incomplete and mistake laden. Looked on CD for sample code. No luck here Chap 32 examples not included. Much better books on market both for learning and reference...this book does a poor job in bothj areas
4,Tommy's still a giant,"This is a great narrative--if not great cinema. It is the story of Kiefer Sutherland's grandfather, Tommy Douglas, who brought humane and cost effective health care to all Canadians. Seeing farmers and workers suffering during the Great Depression, the idealistic young Baptist minister resigned his post as clergyman to became an activist reformer."
1,Never received order:I hate that,"Never received order, However,after complaining received notice right away from company that they are issuing a credit.Hopefully yours, Marlene Melis"
3,where is the light?,"A slow murky nerrative that builds to a anti-climax for the anti-hero. The atmosphere is like prague on qualudes. Raises questions on responsibilities and embracing social change. After reading Bohemial Hrable, Klima is like being coverd in crude oil."
2,OCA Oracle9i Associate DBA Certification Exam Guide,"I am an absolute beginner. I found this book useful for the SQL part of the OCA, namely 1Z0-007; all you need is analytical ability to piece together the concepts presented. The second half which is meant for 1Z0-031 Fundamentals 1 does not do the job of hand-holding the beginner which is the intended audience of the OCA. Instead, it seems re-packaged from the OCP material. I am struggling with Chapter 10 and 11 on architecture and physical database structure as I have no experience with them and could not relate."
2,Many certification topics missing..Do not rely on this book,This is a pretty good book but I was shocked to see questions in the exam (both the exams) that were not at all covered by this book. For example this book claims to list all datatypes in oracle but it does not list the DSI and other Interval datatypes. In exam 2 I realised that one has to read more in depth than what the book suggests. I found it missing several points for the fundamental 1 exam. So Please do not trust only on this book. It does not give a complete picture
4,Good book but....,"I've just passed the 1Z0-007 (50/57) ""which is way harder than 1Z0-001"". The book is a good source to prepare for the exam, well organized and easy to read. Chapters 3&4 (queries and subqueries) are not extensive enough to let u pass the exam. Most of the exam (around 30%) is about subqueries. U need to know how to analyze and debug them to pass 1z0-007 and understand the new 9! SQL features. The worst thing about this book is the exams included. They (DO NOT) match the real test. U r going to have multiple choices (answers) for the same question.Sometimes up to 4/6.The exams in the book still use the old format (on answer).Some of the questions in the exams are repeated. All over this book is fine except chapters 3&4 (queries section).U need to get an extra practice source.I'll write another review when I take the 1Z0-031... Wish me luck... :)"
2,SQL Review,"Having purchased the book and done quite well on the SQL Fundamentals practice exams in the book, I took the SQL cert. exam and failed - 37/57 - Oct 2002. This book was missing important SQL words like USING, ANY and ALL. I recommend this book as a starting point - then purchase Self Test exam questions and you will do very well."
4,Good book for OCA,"I found this book to be very useful for OCA exams. One more advantage of this book is it comes with CD for simulated test, which help lot for exam preparation"
3,Primo electro-art side by side with primo filler,"3 1/2Bola have always been a cut above your typical electronic outfit, belonging to that rare category of techno musicians who elevate their craft past the stereotypical qualities which often plague the genre, turning glitch effects into haunting, resonant meditations on pace. Although not nearly as liberating as some of our more aggressive IDM artists, the signature sound and detailed textures pervading this man's work ensures his place amongst the top of organic electronica. Gnayse may lack the solidity of some other releases, but even in the underdeveloped segue tracks are we able to hear an integrity of sound bridging together to form an enriching audio whole. Bola's self-contained style may sound too methodical for romantic ears, but give the album a complete open-minded run through and you'll be hard pressed to find more simultaneously intelligent, catchy, and involving computer music - there are slightly more solid album's to begin with though."
5,Great chart!,"This chart really helps guide how to address your child's behavior. It has columns for the child's behavior, heart probing questions to ask, what behavior they should ""put off"", encouragement of what to ""put on"", and additional Bible verses relating to the behavior issue. Handy to use as a guide for talking to your children about what God doesn't like and what He says about it."
4,"Great content, wish it were sturdier","The content on this booklet (more like a calendar-type format) is perfect and exactly what I was looking for as a companion to Don't Make Me Count to Three. I can see this being a constant reference tool as I teach and train my kids. Wonderful scripture and covers just about every circumstance I can think of! Great heart-probing questions.I do wish it were laminated and on a sturdy spiral, as I can see my toddler just ripping this right off the fridge. For $4 I suppose I can't expect that, but if you're going to bother putting this content outside the source book (Don't Make Me Count to Three), I sort of wish it were sturdier. All in all I'm pleased with the content and that's what counts."
3,"A little dispointed, but still a good product.","I expected a full book. It is only a chart for reference. Has some good content, but was still a little disapointed. For price plus shipping cost. It really wasn't a good buy."
1,Biblical Misunderstanding,"It still amazes me that those who consider themselves to be Christians (after Christ; not Moses or Solomon, etc.)still keep some of what is ""called"" Biblical law. The Old Testament is a history book which is to lead a believer to the NEW Covenant which has put the Old Covenant (Old Testament) to rest. I shudder to think that the author of this booklet believes that Christ wants them to hit babies and children. Christ taught discipleship. The word 'disciple' means to bring one along side and teach them by instruction and example; not hitting or any other form of violence. I pray that the readers of such books and booklets will follow the example of Christ rather than an outdated, fulfilled, and cast-off Covenant which is no longer in effect. Jerry Townsend, Christian Minister (retired); School Psychologist (retired)."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with this item. It is nothing but a small newsletter. I suppose I thought it was going to be a small book. But some of the things in it are useful.
1,"Another ""How to belittle and beat your child"" guide from Plowman","Zero stars from me. Ms Plowman ought to take some coursework in child development before she tries to write another booklet. Hitting children damages them emotionally and physically and, in fact leads to worse behavior. If she is really a Christian she would follow Christ's teachings. The truth is that Christ held children in high esteem and never advocating hitting them. Don't be duped by reading this drivel."
1,Beating your children hurts and confuses them,"If you purport to love your children, why would you hit them? Hitting sends a message of anger, disrespect, and intent to do harm - - is that really the message you want your children to get from you? There is enough hatred and violence in this world - one's home should be a place of solace and peace - where problems are dealt with through words rather than violent acts. Pass this book by if you have any hope of having a loving, respectful, and rewarding relationship with your children. If Amazon allowed the option - I would have rated this 0 stars."
1,Ridiculous,"The author explicitly encourages parents to hit their children for every act of ""disobedience"". This is ridiculous. Would she have liked those family relations 100 years ago when she was her husband's legal property and he could paddle her like waves on in a deep lake from a canoe? Every act of disobedience? This lady is a violent hypocrite and I'd like to see her husband use some Old Testament ""wife discipline"" on her until she sees that constant beatings with ""rods"" are ridiculous sadism."
1,Misguided and cruel - this book does more damage than good,"Plowman has again not done her homework. She take a transliteration and twists it into horrific child rearing practices. If she had done any research at all on child rearing practices, she would discover that hitting children expresses (turns on) the MAOA gene - a gene responsible for and linked with violent behavior in children and adults. In children raised with love, compassion, understanding and tolerance (something Plowman has neglected to consider), this gene does not express and children grow up with a greater sense of self, fairness and empathy. As a psychotherapist, I can attest to the life long damaging effects of hitting children.We can see that violence has never worked because we are still at war. Who would Jesus hit? Anybody?If you want healthy parenting skills, check out Parenting Effectiveness Training (P.E.T.)."
1,Words of Harm,"What kind of author thinks pounding little kids with objects is a good idea? The usual ""beat your children with a rod"" stuff is in this little pamphlet, as if we needed more reminding of Old Testament brutality like whippings and stonings. It seems any unqualified person can put words on paper and sell them to a violence-sodden public, people looking for ways to take out their disappointment and rage on the most vulnerable, the ""least of these"": little children. I suggest you pass on this book, and read some good non-violent parenting books by Sears, Whitehurst, Granju, O'Mara, and La Leche League. It's worth remembering that Jesus never advocated hitting children. Christ shows us a new way to relate to each other, out of forgiveness and love. Reading the New Testament with open eyes and heart could help a lot of people get away from the idea that violence solves problems. Violence just begets violence. It was the way of Solomon and it didn't work back then either."
5,Wise Words for Moms,"Item is as described and this booklet chart will definitely come in handy ""in the heat of the moment,"" especially since we homeschool, thus spending large amounts of time together with more opportunities to grasp a teachable moment."
3,Wise words for moms,"I didn't know this is like a calendar like style book. It's good in the way that it gives questions to ask and scriptures behind it but it really didn't help with the discipline problems I have like tattle telling, biting, and such like that. this review was done by Amy, steve's wife"
5,"Useful, Positive Booklet - Nothing abusive","This useful booklet gives parents helpful questions to ask their children as they encourage them to put off bad behavior and put on good behavior. Ginger encourages parents to do this gently and wisely. As she says in the introduction, ""Wise words are to be spoken with a loving heart and gentle voice."" There is nothing whatsoever in this helpful booklet about physical discipline of any kind. Those who assert that there is have clearly not read it."
5,wonderful,"I absolutely love this chart (yes, it is a chart...not a book). It hangs on my fridge and I use it daily. It's a wonderful way to have a 'quick' reference for biblical guide to reaching matters of the heart....I bought it for teaching my children, but I've found it's just as wonderful for myself and my husband!"
1,How Can This Abuser Be Stopped?,"WHAT horror did Plowman's parents do to her? 50 years ago we didn't know any better than to consult the biblical sociopath Soloman for childrearing advice. But since then many hundreds of scientific studies have shown that the treatment the author recommends cripples a child's spirit and tragically limits his or her potential for their lifetime. By dispensing her hideously distorted and uninformed views to unsuspecting parents seeking helpful insight, Plowman herself exhibits the very sickness that results from an abusive upbringing. So disconnected to reality is she that she claims her violence-ridden household is ""heaven"". To the children, it surely must be hell."
1,Pure child abuse in God's name,"The author promotes instant obedience, hitting infants, small as babies, with sticks (from the Bible ""rods"") in God's name. How sick can it get till Amazon stop selling such mentally ill ""literature""?My heart goes to each child being raised by such mentally ill ""parents"". Poor children having to be controlled and abused by people who don't even know God's word or what the ""rod"" means. Rod in Hebrew translates from ""shebet"" = the one you guide children with, NOT HIT children with."
2,The Twelve Powers of Man,The books of Charles Fillmore are the best exposition of truth written long ago for today. If you are seeking a clear understanding of the processes of the consciousness and spirit of humanity or are finding that the pulpit is a very dry experience try getting a practical life application in ANY area from these works. This particular book is being used by a local doctor in determining the faulty thinking processes that can lead to physical manifestations of disorder in the body. Once adjusted at the source the physical discomfort is removed and power to excel beyond the current performance of the body opens up exponentially. Some athletes experience from his use of this knowledge 30 percent or more above their prior ability. This can apply to your spiritual path as well or other pursuits that seem at plateau. Worth the reading if you are a true seeker and know that there is more to it.The intelligent organization of thought and writing is a breath of fresh air too.
3,Gave this Amazon purchase to my church library,If you have a need for a good mind expanding experience this is the book for you. Author is or was a member of the Unity church.Get control of your powers. What more can One say?
1,"incredibly, unspeakably bad","Save yourself. Do not rent, purchase, or otherwise obtain this film. Do not view it, it will kill brain cells and make you sterile; it is so bad. Even if you are the biggest Ken Russell fan in the world, do not see this film. In fact, if you are the biggest Ken Russell fan in the world, you have every reason NOT to see this film. Remember the man for his 'triumphs' (if they can be called such), like THE DEVILS, WOMEN IN LOVE, MAHLER, or THE LAIR OF THE WHITE WORM. I would not see this film even if you just want something awful to giggle at at one of your little parties with your special friends. Nope. It's the cinematic equivalent of moldy spam."
4,Great way to introduce Haiku to students,"I read this to 3rd, 4th and 5th graders in our school library and used the book as a jumping off place for a lesson on haiku. They loved Basho's story and it was fun to watch them ""get it"" as they gradually understood the clever fox's tricks on the poet. I would recommend this story for 3rd and 4th graders. Although younger kids might enjoy it, I doubt they'd readily understand the twists and turns in the story."
5,Not too many other options out there,This is about the only cap you can get with external output and i can't say anything but but it did not fit as i found out i had a diff Dist on my motor. The right one which fits works fine
2,technique but no class,"While technically Daniel Smith is a good bassoonist, his playing lacks musicality. Additionally, I find his tone harsh to the ear, and it lacks the refinement that better bassoonists have. The bassoon is a magnificent solo instrument, and I strongly recommend the solo playing by Milan Turkovic, Otto Eifert, or Klaus Thunneman over that of Smith, if you are looking to learn more about the bassoon's solo repertoire. While there are many solo bassoonists out there, the key is finding one who has the technique, musicalness, and darker tone quality that all bassoonists, myself included, strive for. Unfortunately, Smith does not belong in this elite few."
1,DANIEL SMITH IS A HORRIBLE BASSOONIST.,Daniel Smith really is a horrible bassoonist and gives the bassoon a BAD NAME. Anyone that knows ANYTHING about the bassoon would know this. The TOUNGING IS HORRIBLE...and what WORSE sound and VIBRATO could you get???? Plus what is even worse is that he's not EVEN MUSICAL. It is a disgrace that there are so many GREAT players out there that don't make is because of POLITICS. Daniel Smith truly doesn't deserve to be called a virtuoso and it digust me that he is called that. I was EXTREMEMLY upset listening to this CD and please take my advice. Don't waste your money on it. I am a bassoonist...a GOOD one too. TRUST ME ON THIS. thanks!
3,Not for kids,"I loved Bill Peet as a child, and so bought most of his collection for my daughter. She ignores most of her other books. These are her favorites! This book in particular though isn't really for kids. I wouldn't buy this at least for young kids."
5,A great Autobiography about a great Illustrator,I got this book after watching many of the old Disney Classic animated movies. Bill Peet did a lot of work for Disney over the years and I wanted to hear his side of it. A great quick read. Not too deep but fun and all animated the man himself. Definitely worth the time.
1,D O A,"Either the stethoscope was D O A or my wife, myself & both the dogs that are running around here are dead 'cause none of us could make the new stethoscope go pitter patter when we tried. Returned for full credit so no loss other than time."
2,Poor sound quality and color not as pictured,It doesn't look like the pink advertised in the photos. It's a coral color. The sound is not good at all. I went back to my old Littmann that I've had for 15 years.
5,This book may have saved my life. I quit after one read.,"Thanks David - I must have read every book in the universe on the subject of giving up smoking. I read your book and was able to quit a 16 year pack-a-day habit, because your book was not about giving up smoking, but ABOUT smoking. Eternally grateful, Jason"
5,A very useful reference book,"This book has been a constant source of information for me as I attempt to quit smoking. It describes the physical and social reasons for smoking, including relevant scientific research, without descending into scientific jargon. Krogh's general attitude toward smoking (objective) made it possible for me to read this book as both a smoker and (future) non-smoker and gain numerous insights into my reason's for smoking and problems with quiting."
3,"Another good yarn from Elton's school of ""write by numbers""","If you've read any of Elton's previous works, then you'll have a pretty good idea of what to expect - a quick-moving narrative that includes some snappy dialogue, social commentary, pathos and farce (interviewing a witness during a charge across no-man's land took particular advantage of the suspension of disbelief).As with ""Dead Famous"", the murder mystery is only mildly engaging, the characters are similarly one-dimensional - Inspector Kingsley is virtually identical to Chief Inspector Coleridge of the earlier work, while the supporting characters are almost caricatures.Despite this, ""The First Casualty"" is a good yarn, but like ""High Society"" Elton tackles an emotional subject but too rarely provokes strong emotions."
1,1 Star just about.....................,"Having read all of Ben Eltons novels I approached this book with concern as to whether it was a political statement or comic approach to the tragedy of war.It was neither, just Ben Elton trying to put aspects of society into a book and using the war as a vehicle to comment on some moral issues.We have;Gay soldiers falling in love with gay officers, a suffragette woman hating policemen then sleeping with one, a perceived traitor to his country becoming reluctant hero, a murder case that could be solved by a seven year old plus many other poor sub plots.The plot is appallingly weak, the conversations that the soldiers have amongst themselves whilst at the front line are painful to read.Even with 30 pages to go I was still tempted to put the book down !! Utter rubbish."
4,The First Casualty,"The First Casualty. Extremely enjoyable.A story with a difference, some factual history and quite a bit of intrigue and mystery."
3,Great for commuting,"I listened to the audio tape, which is very well done. The story is engaging although the love scenes are trite, and so are the characters. Nevertheless the main characters are likeable and well-drawn.The strong aspects of the book are the very realistic and moving medical passages. The author is masterful in handling these.The plot of BLOODSTEAM is utterly unbelievable and the ending sudden and implausible.The book contains lots of violence, lots of sweetsy feel-good lovey-dovey stuff, and likable characters. If you spend a lot of time commuting, this will help pass the time pleasantly, but I wouldn't waste precious weekend hours reading this kind of fluff."
2,A few too many twists.....,"Having just read Tess Gerritsen's ""Gravity"", I picked up this book with a great deal of enthusiasm. The development of the characters in ""Bloodstream"" was very good, but the plot took a few too many turns at the end that made a good, plausible, fiction story a lttle too hard to beleive.Pass on this version of Tess Gerritsens's earlier efforts, and read her latest one: Gravity. That was superb!"
3,Blah!,"I really like Tess Gerritsen's Rizzoli and Isles series, so thought to try a book of hers, that was a little different. Found it disappointing and lack-lustre. Filled with coincidences and unbelievably neat tidying-up at the end. Though it is a quick read, you can actually opt to entirely skip this one easily."
4,Entertaining!,"Ms. Maxwell masterfully read this medical thriller/horror story. She read in such a way that it was easy to get caught up in the events of the story. The story was fast-paced. It moved along without ever bogging down. Tranquility Maine wasn't tranquil for long, that's for sure! A most satisfying story-well constructed and scary. This was my first book by Tess Gerritsen and I am looking forward to reading more of her books."
2,Teenage Angst in Maine...,"A doctor in a small town in Maine tries to figure out why all the teens are angry and violent, including her own son! All this, in the face of townspeople who don't like her. The answer lies not with youthful hormones but with a nasty heretofore unknown disease, that eats into the brain...OK if you've got nothing else to read on the plane, but the plot and writing style are very choppy, and the ""detective"" aspects either obvious or left as a total surprise at the end (and a surprise that is impossible to deduce from reading, much to my disappointment).Gravity was certainly better, as I've heard Harvest is as well."
2,"Mechanical, predictable & ultimately dull","Ms Gerritsen just tries too hard. Nothing about this thriller really seems spontaneous or genuine. Everything is a device, a method. You feel you're being simply manipulated like a sap. Better writing and some sense of it all being real would help. Skip it."
1,I would give this book zero stars if I could-it's THAT bad.,"This book is an incredibly childish. The scientific part of it is so elementary-any freshman who took Biology I would know more than ""Dr. Claire Elliot"". I'm guessing that the book was dumbed down for a slower audience, but anyone who has a speck of common sense, reading standards, and a little science know-how will definitely want to AVOID this book."
2,"Started well, became incredible","Sometimes writers create a very interesting scenario, but then are at a loss to explain it, so they conjure up all sorts of improbable explanations to try to tie ends up. Doesn't work. There are so may questionable aspects (SPOILER ALERT): first, unlikely the army will want a drug that only creates paranoia & mindless killing of people close to one! There are similar drugs that are hardly useful in combat situations. Trying to eradicate a worm!! Easier to take out a patent. And many other unsatisfactory explanations, even the writing becomes haphazard towards the end."
3,Could have been better,"Tess Gerritsen's Bloodsteam is an all right read. A little too predictable and you almost just want to give up and stop reading it all together. I agree with some other reviewers...you need to check out her later books. The romance factor in the book is okay, but should have been left out...especially since her love interest is married."
2,Desperate,"Tess generally writes a goof story, this was as always well written but the underlying plot was so average maybe she should have let it pass. Admittedly Tess's style was good enough to finish the book. The ending was poor a good read that let you down. Tests dear if you can't finish a story don't publish for the sake of it"
1,If You're New To Tess Gerritsen...,"If you're new to Tess Gerritsen, as I am, (I usually read Robin Cook), don't make this one your first book of hers. I couldn't get through it myself. It is much too languidly paced, much too slow going. Every time I thought it was FINALLY going to start getting interesting and pick up steam, it slowed down again. I don't like real rollercoasters and I don't like figurative ones, either. (Ah, well. Not all of Robin Cook's books are winners, either. You can't hit a home run every time up.)Good thing, though, that I didn't give up on Tess because of BLOODSTREAM as I am now reading HARVEST which is a MUCH better book."
4,Great Read,"This is the first book that I have read by this author. I thought it was original. To me, not being able to figure out the ending is the reason I keep on reading. What fun is it to read a predictable novel? I would highly recommend this book...even Stephen King thinks it was good and who are we to disagree?"
3,Petered out,"I enjoyed this book in the beginning. I thought it was pretty riveting. But then Gerritsen reverted to her romance novel background with a gratuitous (and overly trite) love scene. As well, I really got disgusted when the protagonist sees a sudden violence in her own son's reactions and doesn't guess that perhaps he, too, has fallen victim to the mysterious behavior change of the kids she is investigating. C'mon!"
5,Excellent read _ Gerritsen is top notch,"I just received that book yesterday afternoon and couldn't quit reading it until today when I finished it. What I liked most about this story is that it is so logical, everything is explained at its explosive ending. Great and super enjoyable read. I have just decided to read all of Tess Gerritsen's published books. By the way I buy them for a penny each, another great advantage."
5,an unable-to-put-down-thriller of a book,This was an exceptionally written book that kept me reading longer into the night than I usually do. The medical terminology was deciphered in such a way to not lose my train of thought. I'm on to Bloodstream now.
2,Too far out to believe,"Does not compare to the excellent Harvest. Although, I suppose, that it has medical credibility, the supposition that anything so far remotely possible as the ""worm"" infection that the story is based on in highly improbable. Bloodsteam reads like science fiction, although medical credence is given to the remote chance that such a thing could happen. Also it is very fragmented and scenes are not sequential adding to the confusion of the plot."
3,Not Her Best,"Dr. Claire Elliot moves to a small town to rebuild her life after her husband dies and to help her son get away from his deliquient habits that he aquired in Baltimore.After several months there, the teenagers begin fighting and sometimes even killing people. Claire begins her own investigation after some of the children who committed these acts show signs of a medical abnormality.Interesting concept...but the ending is kind of hokey. Not as good as her first book, Harvest, but still a good read when the a paperback comes out.She has a nice touch with the little bit of romance she throws in."
3,Uneven Medical Thriller,"The medical scenes in this story were riveting, but when the action slowed down, the dialog became somewhat tedious. The characters were an interesting mix of good versus evil. The plot itself was predictable, but for the most part, well told. A little uneven, but a fairly good story."
3,Worth reading,"Bloodstream takes place in a small town in Maine where every 50 years the teenagers in the town become extremely violent for no apparent reason. Dr. Claire Elliott, recently arrived with her teenage son from the big city of Baltimore after the death of her husband, suspects that there is a biological cause for the epidemic of violence and is determined to find it no matter the risk to her life if she continues to search for the truth.Overall, I didn't find Bloodstream quite as gripping as Life Support, also by Gerritsen, which is the main reason I gave it three stars instead of four, but it is still well worth reading."
2,Don't go in the water!,"Bloodstream is a stereotypical medical mystery with little suspense and facile plot solutions. The romance that develops between heroine MD Claire Elliot and the town's top cop is a shopworn plot device, and Claire has no trouble ignoring the inconvenience of his marriage. Claire's difficulties in establishing herself as the town's replacement for a beloved retired doctor, her own son's inevitable infection with the deadly parasite, and the ease with which only Claire identifies the real dangers threatening the town all combine to reduce any suspense that the story might have generated if presented less predictably. The conclusion is truly repulsive, unless you're a big fan of annelids, in which case, you'll love it!Tess Gerritsen has done much better - for a much more engrossing story, try The Surgeon, Vanish, or The Sinner."
2,Read her later books first,"This was the second book that I have read of the authors (after the readable Body Double) and I would strongly recommend that readers unfamiliar with Gerritsen (a talented writer) avoid this book and look at the later books.This novel centres around the events in a small Maine town where the local kids have started random acts of violence. The town doctor notices the acts and works out the correlation between the violence and the strange happenings at the local lake.I found that this was a poor mans Michael Crichton, made worse with the authors leaning towards adding the romance element into the book. It may be just me, but the book seemed written more like a movie script than a novel.A readable book if you can suspend disbelief."
5,This Book was Excellent,"This book was very well written. Tess Greterison did a great job of portraying the two main characters as Claire Elliot and Noah Elliot. Noah and Claire are basically painted with the same brush because both of them both get their edgy when their ""territory"" is infringed on. They often don't know how to back off and let things take its course. If you want a great mystery, then read this book. You will thoroughly enjoy it!"
4,Couldn't put it down read it in one shift at work,"This was my first Gerritsen book and I was thrilled by it. She has to be Stephen Kings twin in style and ability. This is a first rate thriller with an attention to detail that is hard to come up with. Looking forward to reading ""Gravity"" as soon as it comes out in paperback. When will that be?"
3,"Almost, but no cigar","This is my second Gerritsen book, and I'm sorry, but I can't see what every one is raving about. Similar to my impression of the first Gerritsen book I read, this book was decent, but I was not as impressed as others have been. Different scenes in the book were pretty good, but they still didn't add up to more than an average book--in my opinion. In fairness I'll say it may be because I listened to the abridged version of this book on cassette. Maybe I missed elements of the book that those who read it were privy to. At any rate, I give it 3 stars for the effort."
4,Not a bad thriller,"Bloodstream was my first Tess Gerritsen novel, and I will definitely give others a try.This interesting thriller did have some cliche elements to it, but somehow, they seemed to lend familiarity to the tale, rather than a feeling of ""been there before.""The action is thrilling, however, and the science interesting.All told, a novel which caught my imagination and I spent a great deal of time the past few days trying to find the chance to read more."
4,"Good, but","this was a good book, but all the while I was reading it, I kept thinking that a movie with the same storyline had been made sometime after or before this book was released. If you are a fan of Ms. Gerritsen you are sure to like this book."
4,one of her better books,"While I myself have read several of her books, I now just got around to reading this one. It one of her best, the best still is(the surgeon) You should still read this one despite the tame love plot and the rushed ending."
4,love this walker!,"We bought this for our 7 month old who has been standing for quite some time. The walker's front wheels click so it doesn't roll away with your baby! Its awesome on carpet, not so much on tile or wood, it just kinda slides to the side. It also plays music when baby walks and stops when he stops so it encourages baby to keep walking. I definitely recommend this walker!"
5,Best Developmental Toy!,"I bought this walker 2 months ago, for my 8.5 months old baby and I cannot say enough about it!This is by far the best toy I have ever purchased for her. It has been in use from the very first day, unlike any other toy, which my daughter got bored of in a matter of days.She started practicing her walking and was so encouraged by the fun sounds, so she just kept walking and walking... It also comes with 6 colorful small shapes and balls, which the toddler can play and insert into the slots, followed by cute sounds. She enjoys that part, too.A GREAT buy!Thank you Chicco!"
4,quality,"We are pleased with this purchase for our 9 month old grand-son. He immediately took to the sorting and is now holding on to the walker portion and walking. It has nice sound and is sturdy. We have both tile and wood floors and it hasn't ""gotten away"" from him yet. The wheel base is wide enough where it doesn't fall on him when he decides to sit. It has a good varity of noises to keep his interest. I will start checking out more Chicco toys."
3,Video Review,"This is the third activity walker we have tried. I like the Chicco brand and upon first look at this, it seemed to be designed well but after testing it out, I noted a few flaws. The handle bar is too narrow and keeps little ones from being able to place their hands further apart for better balance and steering. It's also rather high up and causes a child to reach far from a seated position. We bought a Little Tyke activity walker that has 2 handles with one placed lower for better stability when a child is trying to stand up.Watch the video [...] for more comments. My daughter is 11 months at the time of this video. Between this and the Little Tykes activity walker, she will only use this if I hide the Little Tyke! Good luck in your search for an activity walker!"
3,Chicco Activity Baby Walker,"My grandson, who is just under a year, really enjoyed playing with the baby walker shapes and balls. Unfortunately the plastic material is not strong enough to hold his weight when he tries to stand up. The locks on the plastic legs work but the walker tips back and bends."
5,Best Toy Ever!,"My daughter loves this walker, I read a lot of the reviews on several walkers prior to buying. I would absolutely recommend this product, since the first day my daughter received she has not stopped playing with the walker. Easy to put together, easy to play with and works well on most surfaces she had a hard time with the walker on our wood floors at first. Once she figured that out the walker goes everywhere with her."
3,"Child loves it, but the music has stopped","My child absolutely loves the walker. However, the music that plays when the baby is pushing it around (caused by the spinning of the wheels) has stopped working after a month! She used to stop and dance to it which was awesome! Oh well, its good and sturdy and does the job."
2,Injured my child,"I received this item as a christmas gift for my son when her was six months old,but didn't open it until My son absolutely loves this product. It's very interactive and the music that plays while he walking makes him want to walk with it more often.I have one big issue with this item which is why it lost three stars. The issue I have is that the hole where a child can put the balls in is big enough to where my twelve month old could reach his hand and arm into it. I was in the next room working on dinner when I heard this blood curdling scream from my son. I went in to find out why and found he had his arm up to his elbow stuck in the ball hole. It took me a bit to angle his arm out. His arm was red for about an hour or so and it also left a small bruise."
4,Great non-chaotic toy for little ones,"This walker is great for little ones when you want a less is more approach.Pro: The sorter is engaging and my son plays with the shapes for long periods of time. It's not chaotic so it doesn't distract him from actually using the walker to help walk. Some of the new walkers try to cram to much stuff into one toy it can become an overload of sensory information.Con: Unfortunately I don't think there is any walker out on the market that is great for wood or tile floors. Just like all the other walkers I researched there is no traction for any smooth surfaces. If you have a large amount of the foam floor tiles for you little one to play on, it works just fine."
2,Not the Best Option,"Not a bad walker but as a previous person mentioned, it tips forward very easily and the brakes don't do anything to stop the child. The activities in front are good, and my son likes playing with it that way but I don't really trust it as a walker."
5,Last long,My daugther plays with this walker since she was able to sit (6 months) and she's now 1 1/2. The way she plays with it has changed and she finds new things to do with it. It was also very helful before she started walking because she would stroll with it all the time.
4,Chicco Baby Activity Walker,My daughter loves this walker. It was so easy to setup. She loves music and enjoys all the sounds this walker makes. She used this to help her start walking for about 2-3 weeks. During this time she was able to grow more confident in walking without it and now is walking all over the place by herself. My only complaint about this product is that it tips forward to easily when something gets stuck under the front.
1,Bulky and hard for baby to push around.,My son barely used this toy. Since we live in a small condo and this toy does not maneuver easily.Hard to turn around corners and hard to push on carpet.I got him a little shopping cart (which was half the price).It was light and he ran all around the house with it.http://www.amazon.com/CASDON-611-Toy-Shopping-Cart/dp/B000V5DHT0/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid;=1303583995&sr;=8-4And a mickey mouse ride on train which he mostly pushed around.http://www.amazon.com/Mickey-Mouse-34918-Plane-Ride-2dOn/dp/B000EX0DRSHe loved these other toys so much longer and used them more often.
5,Amazing Toy,"My husband and I gave my son this for his birthday. He loves this toy, he enjoys playing with all the toys on there. He also enjoys walking with it. The music is fun, its not bad, he seems to enjoy listening to it. I would recommend this to everyone. Better then other walkers out there"
2,Doesn't fit my 2006 Nano,This item did not fit my 2006 Nano (Cover and remote control portion). The nano did not line up with the docking connector. I had to carve away the plastic guide on one side to get the item to work. The plastic cover does not slide over the nano well as a result (hinged only on one side). Everything else works great. The blue light on the transmitter looks cool at night. I wish there was more obvious information telling me that this particular nano would not fit properly.
1,Unrecognized by Imac DVD player,I ordered this video to play in my Apple Imac computer player. The Imac did not recognize this DVD nor did it recognize the replacement which I had sent. The player is in perfect working order and plays other DVD disks with no problem.
5,Great for us beginners,"I saw clips of this dvd on YouTube and knew it was going to be perfect for us newbies to the raw food lifestyle. Jennifer Cornbleet comes across with a crisp, friendly, no-nonsense style that keeps you interested and focused on her teaching. She covers breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts, snacks, smoothies, traveling in the raw, simple kitchen techniques, and appliances that will help you prepare your raw foods. She shows you how to roll California Rolls, chiffonade vegetables, attractively cut veggies and more.You can play each section or you can play all. I bought this video along with the book and I'm glad I did. I'll watch this over and over. It has inspired my daughters and me to strive for raw food eating. Definitely worth the money!Jennifer, please make a video to go with your desserts book!"
4,easy,"Raw Food Made EasyI purchased this DVD and enjoyed it very much. It was very informative; but I would rather she did not have all the ingredients already chopped, sliced, or diced, and etc. they were already measured out and ready to be mixed. I would liked to have seen the preparation of the ingredients. Overall it was a very well produced DVD."
5,SO EASY! AND CREATIVE,"I'm a vegan, and have been for a couple of years, and am looking to incorperate more raw foods into our diet. Which means, I'm not ready to go all out and buy all kinds of crazy equipment, like a dehydrator etc. NONE of her recipes use a dehydrator, and all of the ones she goes over come in a little recipe book in the dvd packet. I thought I would have to write them all down while I watched, but no! She's so bubbly too, and she keeps it simple. No wacky healthfood items. This is an awesome start, and I'll probably buy her book now."
5,Excellent first book on raw foods,"This is an excellent introduction to a raw food diet. It is perfect for one or two people. This book contains clear and complete descriptions of equipment, staples, and how to shop. The recipes are easy to follow and are excellent. I use this book a few times a week now. It makes the transition to raw food easy and fun and wonderfully tasty."
2,burned like hell.,"I have a regime of facial products that I use to keep my skin smooth and blemish-free. I usually use the clean&clear astringent for sensitive skin, but when I went to the store, they only had the deep-cleaning astringent. So I bought it, and when I put it on at night, I was horrified to find that it burned my skin. Not just a mild sting, but full-out, want-to-rip-my-face-off burn. I immediately washed my face and moisturized. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because it does actually work, but it hurts. a lot."
4,Ok product--fair price,If I didn't own shares in Johnson and Johnson--clean and clear's parent company--I'd probably give this product three stars instead of four. So keep buying this product for my portfolio yo.
5,Great product,Great product. Salicylic acid is great to prevent open pores. Product came in excellent condition and is very good for deep cleaning specially for mixed skin. I recommend it.
2,Painful!,"Short of a couple of blackheads here and there, I don't get much acne. I wanted to use this to try and clean up said blackheads, when they occur. I don't have sensitive skin or anything, and typically astringent usually stings a little at first when applied for me, but this was downright painful. It hurt really, really bad. Ouch."
3,An introduction to Gehry,This book is a prologue to more in-depth study of Gehry's work. It's small page format and brief text is ideally suited to a quick brouse and whets the appetite for more substantial critique.Do not expect an encyclopaedic tomb - you can fully digest the entire text in half an hour. It is beautifully presented with full colour photos of most of the significant works. A useful starting point for students of architecture it will provoke interest in the reader but not satisfy those who know Gehry's work well.
1,Don't waste your money on this one,"This battery is not a brand new as stated by the seller. It does not hold charge at all. I am truly believe that it is a very old battery that they are selling. Don't even bother to buy it, you will feel like being rip off by this seller. I gave one star because there is no half a star or less to rate, but it doesn't even deserve one star. Trust me, Do not waste your money on this. Watch out for the other reviewers on this product who rated 4-5 stars, I think they have their own staff rated it for them."
3,"Yaoi is great, but I think this could do better.","""...but I'm your teacher (part 1 & 2), Bloom!, Honey Happy Baby, Voice Box, Scandal Kiss, The View through the Lens"" These are the stories in the book.The stories in this manga lacked, but a few were pretty good. I wouldn't recommend this book for everyone, but feel free to read other reviews to see if you should or not."
2,"No Heart, Nothing grabs you.","The art in this volume is nice, but the stories were short, disjointed and fairly unenjoyable. There was no build up, no tension. For instance the first story we enter is an on going relationship with the uke being the older (the teacher) and the 17 yr old is the aggressive semi. Frankly the entire story is filled with the useless uke whimpering and bemoaning his fate and whether or not he will be able to retain his lover. The sex scenes are good, but much is lost on the lack of any really good storyline for any of the shorts.Don't waste your time."
2,Author's voice interrupts her character development,"While the topic for this novel seemed promising, the lack of dialogue and the constant ""author comments"" that broke the flow of this book made it a disjointed and difficult read. Where was her editor? Really a disappointing read."
4,Worth the wait,"""El Kilo"" is an awesome CD. I gave it four stars instead of five only because I believe that ""A Lo Cubano"" set the bar so high and that they have yet to match it. But that is not to say that their last two CD's aren't good, they are. This CD is better than their last one. Ruzzo and el Guerrero are in top form as their raps are tight and they mix it up well with Roldan's singing. They return to their Cuban roots by incoporating more Cuban beats to their songs, something they got away from in ""Emigrante"". This album is off the hook and even though it has taken them three years since their last one, it was worth the wait."
3,Outdated and misplaced analysis of communication,"My review is based on Chapter 10 of the book dealing with ""Language and Communication in High-Functioning Autism and Asperger Syndrome"".The author misplaces the analysis of the problem that people on the spectrum have with the ""Paralinguistic Features"" of communication (i.e. non-verbal cues). The assumption is that HFA and Asperger individuals don't comprehend or understand these features of communication. In my experience this is pretty much off-base. In reality, it's not the understanding that is the problem but the inability to focus and pick up on the nuances of non-verbal communication. These is a significant difference.In my opinion, it would be a mistake to rely on this book as any type of definitive guide to understanding what is or is not going on in the minds of the autistic. This is from the perspective of one on the spectrum himself."
4,"Entertaining history, but too much focus on Circus Circus","An enjoyable history of the post-mob Las Vegas, but too much emphasis on Circus Circus Enterprises (now Mandalay). Quite a bit of the book was devoted to the rise of Circus Circus, rather than a holistic view of all of the movers and shakers. It left me wondering how much of the book was funded by Circus Circus."
3,LUXOR and Circus Circus. Not much else.,"Alright, this book is mainly about the history of Circus Circus and Luxor. I've stayed at Circus Circus a few times so I found the parts about Circus Circus slightly peaked my interest. For the most part I found this book boring. My favorite parts from it where when he had little grey sectioned pages of stories from actual Las Vegas locals, these were interesting. Unless your very interested in Luxor or Circus Circus OR the inter-workings of a casino I don't recommend this book. You might be interested in checking out, ""24/7: Living It Up and Doubling Down"" by Andres Martinez. I believe these books came out at similar a time and ""Living It Up..."" is a lot lighter read, I got bored too many times while reading ""Super Casino""."
2,Super Casino,"This book was quite a let down. Subtitled 'Inside the ""New"" Las Vegas' it really just re-hashed the old Las Vegas we have read about before. The anecdotes about Owners, Dealers, Hookers, Cab drivers etc, contained in this book could have been written ten or twenty years ago. The story is the same,only the names of the casinos changed."
5,Behind the Scenes of How the Super Casino's Came About,"An excellent, extremely readable book that traces the history of the Super Casino phenomenom. The details on the financing of these behemoths had the potential to be dry, but Early kept it alive and moving (a remarkable talent). The vignettes by ""Vegas People"" were fascinating reading and the details concerning Circus Circus Corp and the development of the Luxor were intriguing. Thanks to Early and the co-operation of the Circus Circus group (now Mandalay properties) we are treated to the behind-the-scenes of how Las Vegas has become, once again, America's playground (but please leave the kids at home). Oh yeah, thanks to Early I'll never drop another ""dime"" on a roulette table. One of the best Vegas books to come along in years."
1,speedo womne's lycra solid superpro suit,"I imagine this suit is fine for some. Like a lot of the reviewers note, these suits run very small, so make sure you have a sense of your size. I had to return mine, which was frustrating because not only did I get charged for return shipping, but the other items in my order no longer qualified for free shipping. The other issue with this model is that the back straps are pretty flimsy. The entire back is basically naked, so there's not a lot of support or rather I would probably keep pulling my suit up and adjusting it with the straps being that flimsy."
5,London Hospital Season 2,because I thoroughly enjoyed it and didn't want the series to end!I was hoping that there was another season. Are there anymore seasons?
4,Great Historical Program,"Based on actual personal notes, newspaper accounts and hospital records from the time this is a very good drama I highly reccommend it."
5,great acting,I thought the acting was very well done . The look at the lives of the hospitalPersonal and the patients and what went on during that time was fascinating.
5,Authentic drama,I loved this series because the stories were taken directly from the records of the hospital. It really gave a feel for what city life was like at that point in history.
5,want more,"Luv it I'm a nurse anf I luv this show, recommend if you enjoy hospital shows of any sort. Also luv the historical tid bitts at the end of each episode."
5,Inconsolable!,"I've just finished the second season of London Hospital and there is no season 3... This is one of the best series I have ever seen. It is in a class by itself. We really, really need another season!!"
5,Excellent series,"Great series. A bit raw and gruesome sometimes but I guess that was the reality of hospital life back then. Some things certainly have not changed over the years and remain with us to this day, i.e., the code of silence among doctors and health insurance company's greed for profit and reckless abondone."
2,Standard fare for a Wingman book.,"Once again Maloney has shown us that he must get small tid bits of information somewhere, does not research them and then uses them in his books. Grain of salt is a requirement for reading any of the Wingman books"
2,Maloney has gone off the deep edge with this one.,"I enjoyed his War Heaven books, but I think he has gone too far beyond reality with this one"
2,!!!!,The 3rd part bugs me because someone else draws it! It dosent look so good unless I got a diffrent verstion and I dont think thats the case the voices are the same I think they do sound a little weird but the story line in this one is way diffrent and I wish I never got it because I was hoping for something good but it really made me sad that it was drawn by someone else but its up to you what you get.
5,This rocks!,"Not being related at all the the TV series, this can be watched without any knowledge of Rayearth previously, and boy, you don't want to miss it.With awesome action scenes, and WONDERFUL soundtrack, top-notch animation, powerful story, and a very very pleasing DVD presentation, this is one you shouldn't miss.The story shocked me at how great it was. I didn't like the TV show as much, but I still enjoyed this, and I think even the casual anime fan, or even non, will enjoy this.This awesome, 3 part OAV shouldn't be missed. Check it out!"
5,Dark Rayearth,"I know many people hated this version of the series, but the bad rep is undeserved. It is a very dark version of the fabulous series of Magic Knight Rayearth. This is best seen if you have already watched at least the first season. The artwork is fantastic, the story line is unique, Clef is best in this version of the show. If you do not like variations of a good thing, or if the dark, depressing colors are not your style, or if you hated X the Movie (by Clamp), skip this OVA. If you'd like to see a new take on a Clamp favorite, then this is a must see!"
1,A totally confusing and choppy...,"Rayeart this is. I have enjoyed both the first and second series of Rayearth and the art is lovely indeed, but this 3 part movie doesn't come close. It looks like the plot was chopped to bits from a 26 part TV series to fit into 3 hours. In fact, it looks like the short version of Escaflowne that is available. Howerver, if there is a longer version of this 3 parter available, I would most definitely get it since this video left far too many questions. I would reccomend anyone thinking about Rayearth for the first time to watch the other two series before even touching this one."
3,MORE FUN THAN TARINTINO FICTION,"Crazy movie that in the first part is like a satire of those 70s Spanish horror movies that have a murder involved with a tour bus. Then, it turns into some trippy comedy akin to Michael Caine's MAGUS movie. There are some dull spots, but it's still an offbeat crime movie with enough good scenes.Micky Rooney in his underwear!Lizabeth Scott, from 40s/50s gangster movies, doing a Melina Macurri immitation!Al Literri from THE GODFATHER also shows up, though akin to GODFATHER 3!Quention Tarintino's over-rated movie of decades later probably ripped off the title of this movie."
1,Pulp,"The movie ""PULP"" is not one of Michael Cains better films. but being a fan of his I watched it any way, its what I do. acting was not bad. story line weak, but over all I can only give it a one star rating for I probably will not watch it again, to many other better movies to watch again and again. With that being said I am a DVD collector and there it will go, into my collection. The one good note is that I got a good price on amazon so no real money pain."
2,Pulp Fizzle,"Fan's of the original ""Get Carter"" be forwarned. ""Pulp"" may have reteamed star Michael Caine and director Mike Hodges but lightning has not struck twice here. The story, when not incoherent, meanders and Hodges' stabs at dark comedy crash down with a resounding thud. Even at an an economical 95 minutes the film seems to drag. Lone redeeming qualities here are the ever charismatic Caine and an all too abreviated appearance by Mickey Rooney as an exiled film star."
2,Approach with caution...,"The authors provide a good overview of the relevant anatomy, physiology, and surgical management of stone disease, which is helpful and intelligible. The same cannot be said for the other chapters: the dietitian co-author fails to do much but adulterate and confuse lists of information pulled out of her references. Despite her impressive credentials, correct information is freely intermingled with ludicrous instructions to ""strain parsley from soup"" and to emphasize beverages such as ""potato juice."" It is possible, with considerable effort, to resolve some of the apparent contradictions among her more conventional recommendations, but the encryption is largely secure. On the positive side, the discussion of calcium and some of the other more academic material was well-done. Overall, the medical chapters may be worth the purchase price, but look elsewhere for dietary advice. -a physician with stones"
1,Don't get the Kindle Version,"Some of the tables that explain diet restrictions in the appendix, which are the most important part of the book, are messed up in the Kindle version."
2,I think about 10 pages in an article would have been enough,"I would buy this used, for reference or go to a library to read it, unless you are plagued with stones in which I would recommend a real naturopathic doctor and some good thinking on your eatting habits."
5,Help is Good!,This book has a good variety of meals that help one with the restricted diet needed by someone who wants to break the kidney stone cycle.
2,Propane Heater,Great comp to deal with but the heater would be good for only in the tent with ventalation. We used it outside and not enough heat comes off. You need to right up against it to feel the warmth. Better off getting their dual head unit
3,Does this have any odor?,"I have had Coleman Black Cats, and they all seem to stink up a bit, probably water vapor and whatever else. Do these produce any recognizable odor?"
3,Not what we expected,"We never used this, we returned it. Not because it was faulty, but because we wanted to use it in our tent. Big bold disclosure, in 3 places saying not to be used in a tent or confined space, and we didn't want to heat the great outdoors..."
5,"Great heater and even better, great company!","As for the heater itself, this single-burner unit will take the chill off... if you want real warmth on a cold night you might consider the two or three-burner units, but for casual use this is a dandy.But even better, when I got mine I accidentally broke a piece on it... I emailed Texsport customer support, they were very helpful and sent me a replacement part for free! Very nice of them. Will buy their products again for sure."
3,Nice images,The text is not particularly insightful but it contains many beautiful full-color cutaways of classic and modern warplanes from the Fokker Dr.I to the F-15. Only downside is that the cutaways don't have numbered keys.
4,Good earthquake latch,I have sets of double doors in my garage that I didn't want to fly open in an earthquake. This elbow catch is good for latching one door.
3,Princes in the Tower,This movie offers an interesting take on what might have happened to the Princess. It is part historical fact and part fantacy since we will never know for sure what really happened. I enjoyed the movie but would not purchase it again.
4,Princes in the Tower,"This is an excellent movie for anyone interested in the Wars of the Roses, Richard III and particular in the pretenders that aggravated the reign of Henry VII. This movie is about the most interesting of them, Perkin Warbeck (who may very well have been the younger prince). The movie focuses on how the princes in the tower may have met their end, if indeed they died there, and who may have been responsible. The end is a little convoluted, and not true to actual history. But all in all a good movie on the subject, telling a plausible story."
3,Good hyperthetical story,A realistic story explaining the fate of the princes. Very enjoyable but picture quality is degarded throughout due to below normal definition.
4,couldn't live without it,"I bought this a year ago to replace my old hair turban that had become worn out. I use this every single day and I don't know what I would do with out it. It is easy to twist your hair into and it stays secure. I have fairly long and thick hair and there is plenty of room in this towel for all of it. The only reason why I don't give it 5 stars is that it does not really do much to dry my hair. It gets the drips out, but I still have to spend some time with the blow dryer to have dry hair. It is still in great shape a year later."
4,Pretty nifty product,I previously purchased a turban from Big Lots and it did the job for the most part. I feel like this towel just goes one extra step. The material feels sturdier and it does a pretty good job drying my hair.
4,great product but missing the button,"I ordered a white and a green turban. I am very happy with how they fit and absorb water from my hair. But, the white turban was missing the button that is used to secure it. It wasn't worth the time to send it back so I'll sew a button on it myself. I'd suggest looking it over carefully when you get."
3,Not the best.,I have this version and the non-elastic hair towel and I prefer the regular one to this. It is more comfortable and absorbs better than this hair turban version.
2,Not a necessity,"I love my Microfiber Bath Towel, so I thought that the hair turban would be a perfect compliment to it! I do like how it wraps up my long, thick hair (with room to spare), but I don't think it absorbs the moisture in my hair any more than a fluffy regular towel. Actually, it gets extremely soaked after just a few minutes in the towel. I wouldn't purchase this product again. Instead, I would buy another bath towel and use a hair clip to keep it up."
4,I love this turban,"I am very happy with this hair wrap. I don't know if it actually reduces my hair drying time. I just like the way it stays on my head so tight. I can get so much more done with wet hair than ever before. I can run up and down the stairs to the laundry room, brush my teeth, put on my makeup, drink my coffee. Could not do that with a regular towel wrapped around my head, that is for sure. I squirt some of my leave in conditioner into my hair before I wrap it (if I remember) and I like the way it feels when I finally take off the wrap. I might have to make this my standard girlfriend gift this holiday season."
2,Didn't really work for me,"There are a couple nice aspects of this product: it is considerably more convenient to wrap around your hair than a bulky towel, it does dry hair somewhat more quickly than a regular towel.I found more wrong than right with it, however. My dislikes are: the material/elastic irritated my forehead and caused it to break out a bit, it does not dry hair nearly as quickly/thoroughly as I'd expected, & (this one is minor) the ""celadon"" looks quite a bit different than pictured here (more like a pastel lime green.)"
3,Doesn't really speed up my drying process...,"I had high hopes for this. With hair down to my mid-back, blow drying takes far too long for my liking. After reading reviews I thought this would cut out some time, but it doesn't. I like the secure turban versus wrapping my head in a towel, but that's where the benefits end. Any suggestions as to what would work better??"
5,most absorbent hair towel ever,"I have very thick hair and this is the only towel that actually cuts down on my drying time. I had bought one about 7 years ago on clearance somewhere and finally was looking for a new one. This was one of the only places I could find it and for the best price. Also, they last forever!! Way better than any other hair turban, I've tried them all!"
3,Good!,"The item is as described but it is a bit tight on the head though I have short hair and a medium-sized head. If I took a shower at night, I cannot sleep in this turban because it causes reddish marks on my forehead and the friction against the ears is unbearable. I recommend it if you have short hair and plan not to sleep in it :)"
2,Too small,I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head. It doesn't fit mine so it was a waste of money.
5,Purchased as a gift,"I purchased this as a gift for a family member who has long hair. She likes it very much, puts it on after shampooing and dresses while the turban soaks up the moisture and her hair begins to dry."
1,Way Too Small,"After readings the reviews for this turban, I was very unsure about ordering it. I ordered it anyway and it was way too small for both me. I gave it to my daughter to try (she has a smaller head than me) and it didn't fit her either. I ended up throwing it away."
1,Not at all for long hair,for people with long hair it is much to complicated to get on and takes way to long. By the time I got it on my hair was alomost dry. Definatly not worth it for people with long or thick hair. Would not buy again!!!
3,This is very heavy.,"very heavy than I thought...this is way too expensive than other hair turbans from the discount store(ross, maxx)!!!I am not gonna return but this would be not used that often..."
3,Not for the Big of Head,"I love Aquis products but this hair turban is my least favorite so far. It absorbs great as do all their towels but apparently my head is too damn big. Its a real stretch to get the button into the awkward loop to secure it. The sides are also stretchy which I don't care for.I have several other style turbans that I prefer. I'm sure this would be great for women with less hair or a smaller head.Ok, now you're picturing me as Medusa or some cartoon head person. Just stop it."
3,Microfibers do a good job,"Overall, this product does a good job. However, regarding comfort, I've found better products for less. The ones I've had before were more relaxed with the material, and most importantly, they used an elastic band to attach to the button in the back. This one uses a cotton rope- like band instead. This does not allow for as much flexibility and tends to give headaches between the stiffer fabric and the different band. However, it was the only one available at the time, and I didn't want to wait for however long it might take for the cheaper one to become available. One thing that works for me - the other two hair turbans I liked better only came in white. So...I lost the first one on a trip to Disney when the hair turban was mistakenly returned with the condo towels. I lost the second one the same way at another resort a year later. So...I got a colored one this time!"
3,Not for big head!,"I ordered this with the Aquis hair towel (19x39). I really wanted to love this turban! I bought cheap hair turban made of cotton before, and while it fits great on my head, the towel just wasn't drying my hair enough (I needed another towel to dry my hair after I take off the turban). After reading so many good reviews, I had high hopes for this hair turban, but when I got it and tried it on, it fit too tightly on my big head. As I secured the loop on the button, I felt uncomfortable pull on my hair (especially on front half of my head). So unfortunately, I had to return the turban. But the good news is the hair towel is superb - and it wraps into a turban shape with no effort, and stays on my head for as long as I want it to. I think the problem with the shape of this turban is that the side is also stretchy. My other hair turbans do not have the stretchy side, and it fits great on my big head. So.. if you have a big head like me, be warned. You may want to go with the towel."
1,Hair Wrap Needs Improvements,This hair wrap needs some upgrading. The pattern is the correct shape and size but the elastic is too short and tight. The elastic is sewn to the casing so there is no way to loosen the elastic. If it had longer elastic making the wrap much looser I would give the product five stars.
2,Aquis Hair Turban!,I love this turban. It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head. It's lightweight and extremely absorbant. I have been using one for more than 5 years. I'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair.
1,Not a developers book,"This book is a hodgepodge if irrelevant and uninteresting information -- some history of the market, some fixed-point math in case u need a primer, and a chart about what is left out of OpenGL ES. There are three pages of helpful info for developers -- dealing with different screen resolutions from an openGL ES world and such. I am the kind of guy who will read a developers book cover to cover, and refer back to it years later. This book will not be one of those."
1,Hastily put together piece of junk,"I was pleasantly surprised to see a book on OpenGL ES already in commerce after such a short time from the birth of the specification and first implementation. Indeed this book, as said in its preface, came out in ""cell-phone time"", (that is, very quick) but unfortunately also in ""cell-phone-quality"" (that is, very poor). It is an incoherent puzzle containing disparate info about EGL, some basic considerations about OpenGL ES functionality, audio for mobile devices, fixed point math and advertising for a few commercial game engines. If you think that looking hard enough you will find at least some info on how to choose and configure your development environment, to see working code for some basic functionality and maybe a little game.. well you are sadly mistaken. Another ""book"" hastily put together to make a few extra bucks at the expense of the unsuspecting reader. Buy only if love rough toilet paper."
5,The Best Bic Pencils,"This is one of the Best Mechanical Pencils that Bic has made, I love the texture and color of it.I used it one time and my children have also use it, we are highly impressed with it so bad that this is the only Bic Pencils that i let them use to do their homework assignments with."
3,the interested music,the interesting CD with enough quiet rock with the music it is proper to listen
5,never wears thin,I bought this for my king size bed and love it. I have washed it several times and it holds it shape and thickness very well. I am getting ready to buy another one for the other room.
5,Works as advertised!,Liked it much better than the Thermos Tritan which I returned because there was way too much plastic at the top to pour liquid out.
4,Good thermos,"The thermos is great! it fits very well in the side pocket of my Ju-Ju-Be B.F.F. for on-the-go bottle warming. The Playtex drop-in liners stand in the cup and it warms them quickly. I left water heated in my Keurig (192 degrees)in it overnight and the water was still steaming when I poured it out the next morning. I knocked off 1 star because the listing said lifetime warranty, the outside of the box said the same thing, but the product insert says 5 year warranty. I don't know about you, but I'm hoping to live more than 5 more years! :)"
5,Keeps coffee hot 8+ hours,This is the best thermos I've ever owned. It keeps coffee hot for 8+ hours. Plan to buy another one soon because my wife uses this one all the time.
2,"keeps things hot, BUT","Hello,we purchased this because we own an older Nissan and absolutely love it. So, I say, lets get another one because some times we have people over and love french press coffee. Both the new, and old Nissan keep things equally hot. However, because Thermos decided to make the new bottle out of 18/8 steel instead of 18/10 like the old one, the coffee in the new one comes out with a metallic flavor. So, we returned the new one. we just couldn't get past the strange flavor the new one imparts on the coffee. if you only want hot, this is a good product. if you don't like metallic flavors, skip this one.cheers,John"
5,Recommended for Arctic Explorers,"I took this little thermos with me on a two month trip to the Arctic where days consisted of sitting on the cold rock on a windy point for 7 hours a day. This little thermos kept my tea hot all day, every day. Amazing!"
3,For Baby Bottle Use,"I bought this thermos to keep in my baby bag and so I didn't have to warm up a bottle in the middle of the night. I noticed that if you don't have the water hot, like coffee hot, then the water gets cold right away. I ended up mixing the bottle with hot water from the thermos and then adding room tempature water. The hot water will stay hot all through the night. I never had a trouble with the cap as some people said they did. Over all I'm happy with it."
5,Excellent!,"My husband asked for this Thermos for Christmas. He is a chemist, so he researches every detail about these types of things. He LOVES this Thermos, so much so that we ordered one for our friend too. No other insulated bottle works as well as this one!"
4,Keeps the heat in better than all the others I tried,"I had a 28 year old Nissan thermos which the cap had finally cracked and was no longer good to use. I bought a few other thermos containers that had very high ratings, but none of them kept the coffee as hot as I wanted for as long as I wanted. Nissan is the only one that keeps the heat better than any other thermos I've tried. The only drawback is that you have to be careful when unscrewing the lid slightly so you can pour. It is difficult to see the arrows that indicates where the pour will come from and I almost need glasses to see it. Otherwise, it is a great thermos."
4,Very long heat keeping,"Like: Keeps heat for a long time, but not 12 hours as advertisedDislike: When washing the cup-cover, water gets in between the stainless and the plastic. Takes a long time to drip it out."
4,Great thermos,This thermos is durable and is the perfect size for taking on the go. I usually prepare tea in the mornings around 7:30 am and I drink the tea throughout the day. The thermos keeps the tea hot all day. Great buy!
2,"Sleek and shiny, but not leak-proof","The thermos is stylish and definitely keeps my coffee hot for a four or five hours. My problem? The top! I have so many problems getting the primary top to screw into the thermos properly. Invariably, it goes in crookedly and allows coffee to spill. I try and try...what's the trick?!?! Eventually, I give up and screw on the cup. Liquid won't leak out with both tops on, but when I arrive at work and take off the cup, coffee dribbles down the side from the improperly tightened lid. Definitely disappointed."
1,Lid doesn't fit-LEAKY,"Wow, I am truly disappointed with this thermos. I got this item as a gift for my husband for Valentine's Day, and he was thrilled to have such a nice little thermos to take to work. Unfortunately the lid does not screw on properly. I don't know if we got a miss-threaded thermos, but it leaks, and doesn't seat properly in the bottle. With much effort, he can sometimes get it to close with just a little leakage. But no one wants hot coffee spilled on their lap. The thermos does keep hot coffee hot, especially if you pre-heat the thermos with hot water. But with a leaking, improperly seated lid, it doesn't serve well for travel. Very disappointed with this piece."
2,Does not keep it hot as promised,I thought this bottle would keep my tea hot for at least a day. No way. Stanley thermos is a much better product for keeping liquids hot.
3,Its a good but too big for my diaper bag,I use it for mixing my baby's formula while traveling. It keeps the water hot for 3-4 hours and then gradually it starts getting warm. The water still remain warm after 6-7 hours. I just wish they had smaller size in this. Overall its good product. However I am not sure if its worth the price.
2,17 oz. Thermocafe not as good?,"Like reviewer mommyofchristopher, I too bought the 17 oz. ""Thermocafe"" Thermos at Walmart. I have the Thermos/Nissan 34 oz. bottle, and it keeps things hot for the long periods other reviewers have found. The 17 oz. Thermocafe branded model is good for only 3 to 4 hours hot, then it gets noticeably cooler. A case of you get what you pay for?New development: after one week of hot coffee, the pliable plastic/rubber stopper ring now has a terrible smell/taste that transfers to the coffee. Yikes! A strange plastic - burnt taste. I've soaked it in a bicarbonate of soda solution that has helped some, but not enough. I stopped using the ""Thermocafe"" Thermos, until I figure this one out. Could it be the coffee type? Is the stopper ring made of crappy materials?"
2,Not like old Thermos Bottles,"My mom has insisted me to buy Thermos as she, her sisters and family has been using Thermos since 1970s. This particular bottle doesn't keep water hot for even 12 hours. As stated in the product description, it can't keep the beverages hot for 24 hours. Probably Glass Thermos bottles can hold temperature for 12 hours. Also the lid doesn't fit properly."
3,"Hot, not piping hot","This is my third Nissan 16-ounce, and I've been using them for 10 years. I wore the first two out, and recently replaced my trusty four-year old one. This is the first time I notice the beverages are not piping hot--I am wondering if there has been a change to the design. The size is the same, and it fits nicely in a briefcase, holding at least a mug-and-a-half of coffee, but my previous Nissans held coffee PIPING hot. This one holds it hot, but the coffee definitely loses heat as hours go by. The old versions were nothing short of miraculous--this one is about average for a thermos."
5,Keeps coffee warm - does it's job,"I like the slim design for being able to fit it in my work bag. I also like the stainless steel exterior.I've had it almost a year now and it is still doing what it is supposed to do with daily use. No problems with leaks.In retrospect, I probably would order a 20 oz version just to have a bit more capacity - but that is not a complaint against this product itself."
5,Keeps coffee hot FOREVAH!!,"I can't believe hot different this Thermos is from the one called simply ""Thermos""...This is the Thermos Nissan. The first one barely keeps coffee hot 1-2 hours. The ""Thermos Nissan"" keeps coffee hot for 12 hours or more. It's amazing!And it's slim and fits easily inside most bags."
4,I wish I knew about this product several years ago.,I absolutely love this product.It looks good and keeps my coffe tasty for many hours.....about 6 hrs.Is the larger model better?
5,Great Scope,"This scope is the clearest scope i own, even compared to those $300 more. The BDC reticle is perfect. Nikon is the only scope i will buy now. Highly recommended."
5,Awww man....,"yeah.... yeah... get it!I read all the reviews regarding the buck Master and so on. My first thoughts were ""Can't be that good""...It is!!I love the fact that you can switch Ammo Brands and then simply pop the new info into the Spot On Calculator and you have holdover sorted!Great Optics and a host of Features make this a real Serious Contender against Bigger Names costing Twice the Price...The Side Focus is awesome.You will not be disappointed!!!"
1,"WHAT A FANTASTIC PERSON,WRITER,AND TEACHER","Well just to start off I never read her book but am in her homeroom class and a student in her English/Composition class and second of all I can't call ehr by her first name because it sounds weird because i'm her student but anyways I've heard from other readers that her books are an inspiration and are wonderful!My grandmother has read her book and said, ""You are so lucky to have such a gifted english teacher"". Well i'm sure it's a good book along with her other book ""Mistress in the Muse"" but anyway just to let the world know she's my teacher and i'm her FAVORITE student j/k i'm her part time favorite student the other part is Brian but i'm sure sh is wonderful and gifted so go out and read it i will when i'm older!Sorry if i made any grammar mistakes Mrs.Hoos!"
5,From a Reader,I would just like to say what a wonderful book Suzanne has made. I wish greatly that it was still in stock. She is such a wonderful writer and uses great descriptions of everything. I will be on the lookout for anymore books!
5,High Quality,"Slept on the pillow cases, soft no scratchy feel.Well made good color, nuetral goes with blue sheets well.I spend more time in bed then most people, I have a radiation fatigue syndrome due to cancer treatments. So sheets can shaff, cut, and contribute to bed sores. Royal Velvet is more comfortable due to the high quality, I am very pleased."
4,"A controvercial, informative and important work.","It was interesting trying to decifer what is actually fiction and non-fiction in this book. The ritual which took place near the beginning was so grossly sickening that it would seem that no individual in their right mind would write this down unless it were true. It would also seem that with the evidence uncovered by Father Gladstone; those involved should have done either some harsh time or even better, death by lethal injection (religeous belief not withstanding). Although it ended as though some pages were missing, it was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Father Martin was a great man and an important writer for these sometimes trying and immoral times in which we live in today."
5,Implosion of Church explained,"As an ecclesiastical insider and official exorcist, the credentials of Father Malachi Martin to write this book are impeccable. Here at last is a credible rationale for the Church's heretofore incomprehensible implosion and which forces and why compelled Roman Catholic prelates and priests ordained before 1967 who support the aftermath of Vatican II to forget the universal vow put in place by St. Pius X that they ALL made preconditional to their ordinations to combat Modernism which, as St. Pius wrote, is the greatest heresy. It answers why warnings one could ordinarily expect of the new 'ism"", globalism, the new irreligion, have not been sounded by what remains of the Church, truly a ""windswept house"", or by any media, secular or otherwise, and left to young people in Seattle, way ahead of most, to finally sound the tocsin."
3,Definitely held my attention,"In the end, however, this book was disappointing, to no small degree because it doesn't end--it just stops. The conflict is unresolved, and the reader has no real way of predicting the outcome.The book has other flaws. It is drastically overwritten, and the characters' names are oddly jarring, as though they have been badly translated. Additionally, it is difficult to tell where Martin's perception of the modern Church ends and his fictional spin begins, making the tone strangely cynical.I read this book because I really liked _Vatican_ a number of years ago. While I read this fairly quickly (in spite of its length and convoluted syntax), it didn't live up to my expectations."
3,"Unnecessarily wordy, but intriguing as well","Anyone interested in the future of the world would benefit from a browsing of this book. It is a thought-provoking analysis of the spiritual battle that rages within the hearts of men, as well as organizations. Gems of insight are contained in this sea of a story. I believe all of the conspiratorial innuendo, and one would be a fool to ignore it. What, think ye not that the prince of this world exerts power in high places"
5,"Riviting, compelling for Catholics and non-catholics alike","Malachi Martin's book is like watching history in the making, as one is confronted with the fact that there are Cardinals who are satanists, homosexuals, anti-papists and other high level individuals that we never hear about who are dedicated to one world rule. Apparently the Pope is surrounded by men in clerical garb who are working hand in hand with financial institutions, educators, governments, foundations, and non-governmental organizations such as Masonry to bring the new world order into existence. It's a book written by a man who apparently grieves over the state of the church today. As a non-catholic I found the book compelling because the ""updating"" of dogma and the modernism taking place in the Catholic church is also taking place in non-Catholic seminaries and churches. It's a matter of concern for many who desire to be true to our Lord Jesus Christ."
1,interesting fiction,"I'm a little troubled that the majority of the reviewers think this is a work of fact. If so it would not be labeled fiction. He states 85% is fact. Well there is really no way to check which 15% is not true or what is true, so we assume everything is dead on accurate. I thought this would be a great thriller myserty book based on the Vatican. Instead I got the uneasy feeling he was trying to turn the general public against Catholicism (there's a novel idea and one that hasn't been tried before) by presenting his fiction as a work of truth. It's easy to hate Catholics, and it sells so I'm not surprised this book is getting glowing reviews by those who have no idea what Catholics actually believe in, but remember the urban legends they heard growing up. I bet anyone could take this idea (pretend to be a factual book) and rip on a major religion with fiction and make a mint."
5,A definite read: chronicles church conspiracy with NWO,"According to the author's own admittance, this book is no ""Novel,"" but an account of actual goings on in the highest ranks of the Catholic Church with the New World Order elite, written by one who was slated to become a Cardinal. 85% of the details are based on actual occurrences and people.Malachi Martin eloquently captures the wrestlings of the human heart over the grappling issues that face a faithful saint when confronted with these paradoxes of Satanic allegiance within the highest ranks of the church (and certainly the phenomenon is not unique to the Catholics).A riveting plot. I read it in a week -- could hardly put it down."
4,WINDSWEPT HOUSE,"Great read!! I had never heard of this author before and someone clued me in and after reading this book, it really had me thinking about what goes on behind the Vatican walls, if even part of this book is true then humanity is in trouble.Great conspiracy read."
5,FICTION - OR THINLY VEILED FACT?,"WINDSWEPT HOUSE reads like a biography and leaves the reader wondering how much of it is fact, thinly disguised as fiction.The crumbling of society that has only escalted since this book was first published is no longer inexplicable, no longer the fault of one president or the passage of one bill or any of the usual scapegoats. Martin traces an intricate web of evil and perversion coupled to power struggles and greed that rumble beneath the surface of society's foundations, splitting it with high-pressure fissures, cracking it apart. He clearly lays out how we have all been brainwashed into welcoming what was recently abhorrent to us.Was Malachi Martin gifted with an unusual insight and foresight, or was he simply unmasking the host of the perverted masquerade ball we have all unwittingly been attending?WINDSWEPT HOUSE is an unusually thought-provoking piece of fiction. Or is it thinly veiled fact?"
3,Missing Something,"The book was a fairly frustrating read, for a couple of reasons. First, my paperback copy began Part Three with two completely blank pages - the story picks up on page 270 with these words: '...who came to know intimately...'. Second, I compared the number of pages Amazon says the book has with the number of pages my copy has: Amazon - 656, my copy - 646. Even if you add in all the additional pages at the beginning - frontispiece, contents, cover page, etc., and both front and back covers, my copy is still 3 pages short.Perhaps there was a final chapter (ten pages would be just about enough space) and its omission in my copy is an assembly error on par with the blank pages 468 and 469. I would believe this if I was the only one who noticed the abrupt ending, but since many of the other reviews mention it ...I likely will read more of Malachi Martin's fiction works, but I'll not spend $25 for another one - I'll find them at the public library."
4,disappointing ending - no resolution,very rivetting book. lets the reader down at the end because there is no resolution.
3,"An exciting, gripping but slanderous read.","I have to say that I found ""Windswept House"" to be an exciting novel of suspense that attempts to understand the battle between the Church and Evil. I really enjoyed reading it. Having said that, let me say that I have real problems with the book. It is libelous and slanderous. While pedophilia is a grosteque problem within the church, Martin goes too far by suggesting that the late Cardinal Bernadin was the head of a satanic, pedophilic ring. It was clear to me that Martin based his creepy cardinal of ""Century City"" on Bernadin. I later read an interview with him where he said that this was indeed the case. This is not only a lack of Christian charity but is pure, sinful slander. What possible good can Martin's book do on balance when he engages in this sort of character defamation? Read Michael O'Brien's ""Plague Journal"" to see a true Christian response to Evil. As a suspense novel, I'd give ""Windswept House"" 5 stars; as a Christian novel, I give it one."
2,"it's a sermon, not a story","This reads more like a sermon than a story. The plot was as shallow and unbelievable as a hand puppet show.The author's thesis is also distorted and obviously wrong. He makes it sound like all changes in the Catholic Church since his childhood came because of Vatican II, and could have been prevented by strong popes. That ignores the reality that the changes in the Catholic Church were just one small part of the tidal wave of change from the counterculture of the 1960's."
2,PLEASE DON'T READ THIS BOOK,"I am an avid reader and couldn't wait to read this book. Then I couldn't wait to finish it, I didn't think I was ever going to get through it. The first 500 pages seemed to just drag on and on, too many words that just didn't really say anything. Too many characters. The last 162 pages finally had some action, but the ending was unsatisfying.As a Catholic I don't know weather to be outraged or just plain depressed. This novel has left me questioning many things about my church and the future of it. I know that my church is made up of humans so by it's very nature it will be sinful. But I can't believe that pure evil will be able to destroy the church that Jesus left for us here"
2,"Other than the cup, the rest of the items are extremly low quality","I have several of Nissan travel mugs and cups, all high quality very durable. Thought this desktop set would be a reasonable quality item, huge mistake.Other than the cup itself, the rest of the items are poorly made. The self put together clock seriously is the type of item you find in $0.99 store. The platform itself is very light weight, try to pull the sticky pad and the whole thing moves unless you fill the cup with water to add weight.The photo holder keeps falling down.The paperclip, pen, and misc item holders are made in odd places that is really difficult to get anything out of it.If you want something nice on your desk for display, this looks cheapy. If you want an organizer to clean up the desk, it doesn't hold much and too odd shaped to be useful. So it fails on both end which makes the item useless. The only reason for the extra star is because the cup is still a high quality Nissan cup."
4,Read it more than once as a preteen,"It exploits the secret fear of every kid: That you're secretly adopted. The thing is, that element of the story, as I recall, was superfluous. The real story was Rusty's going through puberty, being a tomboy then needing a bra, making that transition being the only daughter with four brothers. That's why I give it four stars: The adoption thing could've been eliminated entirely and the book would've been just as good."
3,apples & oranges [spoiler],"I recall this one from my childhood. It must have intrigued me, because I recall reading it more than once. While it was engaging, the explicit conflict (every kid's nightmare): The protagonist discovers at age 14 that she is adopted -- was not really what the story was about. The real story was about Rusty, the only girl among five siblings, who seems uncomfortable in her (female) skin. As I recall, the element of Rusty's discovery of her having been adopted seems to have been put there in order to sell the book more than for any other reason, as it needn't have been there at all; Rusty's conflicts were interesting enough on their own."

4,good fit; good price,"I don't know about the last review, but i wore these as underwear, not out in the open. The fit was good; no binding or bunching. Covered everything well."
2,pease replace my item.,"The style and design are unicque, very well done, I would like to order two more but medium please. The material did not do very well after washing."
5,CLASS-SICK HOLY HIPHOP,"Man this is classic HHH at it's finest! I have listened to a lot or HHH albums and there are good one, but this album is in a class by itself. It's the perfect combination of Christology and classic HH tracks with an energy that only a true student of scripture like The Ambassador can bring. Hands Down CLASS SICK!T.A.G-ZHHM"
5,"GREAT JUICE , FAST DELIVERY","GREAT JUICE , VERY HEALTHY , GREAT START TO MY MORNINS , MUCH CHEAPER ON AMAZON AND FAST DELIVERY ......RECOMMENDEDUpdate : Been having it for about 4 months now . Good start to my mornings . One thing I like to mention , it does have some high sugar content in it . Not sure , if it's the natural source or it's been added . Try to find out more about it .But for me , I am a big fan ....It does have a slight hint of chocolate ( as the other reviewer mentioned ) + hint of tea too . Very convinient packaging . Not available at many places though . Saw it first at Whole foods . It $1.99 there , but on amazon it works out to be cheaper 23.50 -- final price . Great deal ......try it out ....its a good thing to get addicted to ."
4,This book is beautiful,"The photographs alone inspire awe. For a layman, this is avery good book, with very brief descriptions of differentaspects of 20th century physics presented along with themagical photographs. Perhaps, the non-specialist can glimpsethe fascination and beauty of physics from the photos and canget just an idea of why the professionals are so dedicated tothis most basic of all scientific disciplines."
3,"Good, but suffers from poor editing.","I agree completely with the other reviewer. Overall, a good addition to the Campaign series, but hopefully the next edition will emerge without the numerous small errors (units, locations, dates) that can make it an occasionally frustrating read."
1,Not enough pieces,"Gave as a Christmas Gift, and went to play it on Christmas Day, only could play with 3 people and then we could not give the correct amount of pieces for each person to start with. Then ran out of pieces only 1/3 into the game. Unless you are going to buy 3 boxes to play the game, then it was a great disappointment.PatColorado Dec 2012"
4,Fun and entertaining,"I would give this a 4.5 stars. It is fun and entertaining, but has not great educational value. We love the ""twist"" that the bendominoes have, it makes it more interesting that regular dominoes. The only downside to the game is the number of pieces (28), that allows for just 2 to 4 players."
1,He'll never have that recipe again... OH NOOOOO!!!!,"I was a major, I mean, MAJOR fan of the Harris/Webb projects ""A Tramp Shining"" & ""The Lawn Went On Forever"" and this CD collection is nowhere near the artistry or sincerity of those two projects. Harris sounds like freakin' Robert Goulet in these two CD's and the arrangements are kinda' cheesy.The songs on ""Slides"" are written by Tony Romeo who also wrote for the Partridge Family.The ""My Boy"" disc does have some Webb songs on it which somewhat helps but Harris' singing is so lounge lizard slick it kinda' ruins the whole ""regular guy"" sound of the other two Webb projects.I don't take a shine to this ""Tramp"" of a collection"
5,Slides is simply great,"I've adored ""Slides"" since it came out new in the early 70's. Richard Harris performs each song as both an actor and singer and Tony Romeo's compositions are simply beautiful. Both artists are gone now, but this music will live on forever..."
2,Not his best work,"Richard Harris was and still is my favorite actor. I very much enjoyed A Tramp Shining as well. On this particular double cd, My Boy is the best of it all. Much of the music is terrible, and his delivery, unfortunately, is histrionic. I love the sound of his voice whether talking or singing but when the lyrics are ridiculous and the music pretty much the same, there wasn't much he could do about it. Except pass on the recording."
3,For Richard Harris Fans Only,"I would NOT recommend this CD to those who are not already RH fans. A Tramp Shining would be an infinitely better place to start if you are familiar with his work. Some reviewers (see review by Coolerking)are unaware that one of the songs on Disc 1)- ""Ballad to an Unborn Child"" - is actually the music from another RH movie ""Man in the Wilderness"". In my opinion the title song ""Slides"" is the sole highlight of Disc 2.Overall the title song, ""Once Upon a Dustry Road,"" ""I'm Comin' Home,"" and ""Best Way to See America,"" form the value in Disc 2 with ""Beth,"" ""Ballad to an Unborn Child,"" ""My Boy"" and ""This is the Way"" being the strengths of Disc 1. A GOOD CD but, far from a GREAT CD. - Mountiain Man."
5,Excellant Resource,"This book is an awesome resource for info on the Uintahs !! Packed with all the information that is relevent to the back country enthsiast, and accurate as far as I can tell. I bought this used, and it came in much better shape than it was described."
1,valrhona cocoa sticks,"Althought these have a good flavor, they are full of petrified stems (like cement) that are not edible. They could easily break your teeth! Suggest you find another brand."
1,Colossal Atrocity,"If you want to watch ""scientists"" capture, kill, and dissect an amazing Colossal squid, you'll love this film!Personally I enjoy my nature alive and being carefully studied, but hey, science isn't ethics, right? I mean, we can't all care! That would be soo hard. HAHAHAHA."
4,STALIN WAR NOT PLEASED,A FIRST RATE BOOK ABOUT AN UNKNOWN WINTER WAR THAT JOSEPH STALIN WAS NOT HAPPY WITH TO SAY THE LEAST. GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THE POLITICAL CLIMATE IN FINLAND LEADING UP TO THE RUSSIAN SUPRISE ATTACK WHEN THE FINNS BRAVELY FOUGHT FOR THIER FREEDOM. THIS BOOK GAVE ME A BETTER MENTAL PICTURE OF FINNLAND & JUST HOW BIG IT IS. I DID NOT REALIZE HOW CLOSE TO LENNINGRAD THE FINISH FRONTIER CAME PRIOR TO THE START OF HOSTILITIES & HOW HUGE LAKE LADOGA REALLY IS. I ALWAYS WONDERED WHY THE FINNISH MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAD THE TWISTED CROSS ON THIER FUSELAGE SIDES & THE AUHOR ANSWERS THAT QUESTION. YES THE MAPS ARE HARD TO READ & COULD BE IMPROVED UPON. THE RUSSIANS DID WIN IN THE LONG RUN BUT NOT BY MUCH CONSIDERING HOW BIG THE RUSSIAN BEAR REALLY IS!
5,great reading,"awesome reading of a awesome moment in our recent history. How finland could survive this war?? David vs Goliath. but not all was romantic, finland has to make a lot of concesions, and they ""lost"" too the war in a certain way. its the best example of how always both sides lost in a warthis war has been forgotten over the years, and with this book is posible to remember or know for first time one of the most heroic moment in our history. a fight for freedom and for independence.I loved the book"
5,A Little Known (In the US) War,"It seems like there's a common lesson to be learned in most countries going to war for the first time in a long time. The British got theirs at Dunkirk, the Americans at Kasserine Pass. The qualities that make up a good peace time officer aren't the ones that are needed when the Army goes to War. The Russians got their lesson in Finland. They learned that you don't purge all the competant officers for political reasons and then expect the yes-men to do well.Finland had a pathetic little army: not a single anti-tank gun, only about a dozen modern fighter planes, their field radios weighed 300 pounds and didn't work well in winter, stocks of machine gun and artillery ammunition were very low, all in all, in no condition to wage war against the largest army in the world.On November 30, 1939 Russia started the war. About a quarter of a million Russian soldiers died, and about 25,000 Finns. It's an almost ignored (in the US) part of World War II."
4,Wave after wave,"There are few good English-language sources about the winter war. I found this one to be gripping. As wave after wave of Soviet assaults break on the Finnish defenders, you can start to feel a little worn down too. But, I suppose that's just the subject matter. I'd read it again and I'd recommend it."
3,I Read It Straight Thru.....,"This is one of the few books that I've read straight thru (OK, OK, at least in one day...).As a militaria buff I found this book interesting and absorbing. The above reviews are on the money, however, in that the absence of maps and/or more detailed maps relating to the text is an aggravation as is the somewhat dry delivery. Nevertheless, I found the information contained in this book fascinating and informative. It really filled in gaps in my knowledge of military and political events prior to or immediately preceeding WWII. One interesting factoid that caught my attention: Hitler's decision to attack the USSR in '41 may have been partly predicated on his observation of the terrible performance of Soviet troops and commanders in the Russo-Finnish War.I now have a great appreciation and admiration for the Finns thanks to this book."
5,Fantastic,"As a Finn this is a very close subject to me and especially because my father fought in this war. I've read a lot of books about it, but this was the best of them all - and written by an American! If you are interested in the Finnish history, military strategy or strategy in general, this book is a must for you. I hate wars and after reading these descriptions of the battles I hate wars even more. But this book gives you hope, that with guts and cunning even miracles can happen in desperate situations."
4,Finnish sisu,"The Finns knew how to fight a guerilla war. Unfortunately they were under staffed,and the Russians ran over them with their tanks. Then they got back at Russia by siding with the Germans. THATS what I call SISU."
5,None,Buy it. Exceptionally well written. Good balance of strategic overview with enough but not too much operational detail. A page turner...and the good guys as good as won.
1,knife broke in use,"Do Not Buy these they do not have full tang construction . They will break through the handle with slight pressure replace if purchased already. I was lucky they were a gift but one I would have liked to return to the giver. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap"
1,"Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it","About 2 months ago, I bought a set of these knives. This was my first ever knife set. I didn't mind the minimalistic design and the wood block, although I wouldn't use wood: it is not hygienic. I also noticed that the knives tend to get stuck in the middle of cutting something.However, today the worst happened: while cutting something, the handle broke and the blade came out of the handle. There is no way to repair it.FAULTY MATERIAL OR DESIGN, maybe both...?I checked out the official Farberware website. I have to say, there's a lot to improve. Hopefully they will respond quickly, and will be kind enough to replace my broken knife."
4,Good book,"Even I just read part of this book, I already like it. It really tells you from how to write to how to write it professional. It gives me lots benefits to learn and shorten the way I have to go. I totally believe I will have good score in my test."
1,Buyer Beware!! These balls destory clubs!!!,Stay far away from these balls!! They will DESTROY clubs!! These things are not designed for newer golf clubs and the company knows this and will do nothing....BEWARE[...]
3,Tea kettle Click clack,"The mechanism is a bit hard to operate and if you do not ""clack"" it closed, the kettle can run down and the whistle will not ring...This company has another model where the handle moves up and down and it is harder to leave it open and boiling away...when this other model on the stove, it closes automatically unless you force it to remain open...better function"
5,Searched a long time to find this great tea kettle,This is it! Wonderful and the whistle is loud and the kettle does not burn your hand while trying to pour the water put of it.I use this everyday and donated my other ones to goodwill.
4,Works great.,"A little bit big for the counter, otherwise it's great. Works as it's supposed to. Heats water quickly. Good price."
5,This book makes me want to get out and DRIVE!,"This book makes me want to get out and DRIVE! If you ever had a love affair with a vehicle, this book is for you. Enjoy it."
4,Great game,"If you like first person shooters, it's hard to beat the constant challenge of playing real people online. Most first person shooters are single player, and after you play through you are done with the game. If they have a multiplayer option, it is usually slapped together and not very good. Often, it is a ""spray and pray"" type game.This game keeps going, and is continually challenging.I am almost 40 so I am not as fast as these younger players, but I do OK.You need a decent video card, and a fast internet connection, DSL or cable. Add 5.1 surround sound Kinyo headphones and you are really in the game. Many hours of fun. See you on the battlefield!""Toth Amon"""
2,Not too good.,"This could be a good game if there was a way to play it other than online. Unfortunately, the description of the game doesn't tell you that that's the only way it works."
4,WW2 Beauty,"The older versions of DoD remain in my heart some of the best online titles of all time. This new version does not disapoint. A visually stunning frag fest. For the 16 bucks that it is offered here you will find no better entertainment for your dime.It is a pretty hardware intensive game. But if you were able to play Half-life 2 or the recent Counter-Strike: Source you should be up to par. The online community at www.dayofdefeat.com has some fixes, too, for those on slower machines.By the way it looks as if you can demo this game for free this weekend of the Feb 9th. see ya in game.aka Col.Krust"
5,Textbook,A good textbook for college for those who are learning how to teach English as a Second or other Langurage.
3,Good book!,"I purchased this book as recommended by my TEFL training instructor. Very good, if you're in the field I highly recommend it."
5,Homestead,This was an excellent book! very good reading and would be appropriate for anyone. Good story and I loving knowing it is all something that happened!
3,Lost interest toward the last fourth of the book,The story was interesting in the first 3/4 of the book but really trailed off near the end. More pictures would have helped describe the story better.
4,Interesting Read,"I enjoyed the book. The ending could have been more detailed, but it was an enjoyable read. I have already passed title to a friend to read."
3,Worth your time,This author has an engaging style that made me feel as if she were sharing her story over a cup of tea in my living room. I gave it 3 stars only because it should have ended several chapters before it did. The wrapping up chapters could have been condensed. I would be interested in reading her fiction offerings after reading this.
5,"Convenient, easy to clean","I've used this mug for about 1 month now. I love that it's so easy to clean. The travel mugs I used before had a plastic top that would slide to open. It was impossible to thoroughly clean all surfaces of the top, so it began to smell bad unless I poured boiling water all over it. The top of this thermos has no hidden surfaces, so cleaning is easy. It insulates beverages pretty well too. The only improvement I would suggest on the design is to have the bottom plastic base be removable to clean also."
5,Fashionable but beware,"I happened upton this watch for $24 on some freak sale from Amazon (MSRP is $160).Since it was being sold by Amazon not outside vendor I thought it can be trustworthy and won't get some fake one.I got an awesome price but it may be because it's not in a mint condition. It came with a fancy and original looking box tag and all, but it did have a small scratch right next to the watch part and some scratches in the back again by the watch part.I wiped it off and it's barely noticeble in the front and back, who cares.Happy with the purchase especially for $24 bucks. Probably won't pay $160 for it though.Watch is not bendable so if you have a thick wrist then good luck trying to put it on. I tried it (i'm 6' man) my wife had no problem but she was worried that it may slip out."
3,Book for class,"Needed this book for a class that I'm taking, GREAT price and came right on time. This book gets the job done for my credit, but I know a few books that are a little easier to follow as far as learning about blue print reading."
1,book really sucks,Bisharat taught my CM class with this book. I had to read the book and learned nothing. Find another book.
3,its alright,"bought it for class, teacher says she didn't like it and is changing next year to a more informative book"
5,Best CD of the year,This CD is a gem! I bought a lot of great African music this year but this CD stands out as the best overall. There are a lot of amazing songs here - and you'll never hear these played on a commercial radio station...
1,I don't recomend this,"I licend to the samples, and trust me they'r fake every one of them, I here it on there voyces, because I have heard many of them on the radio and even have some of them on different cd's, some from the original artist/band and others on collected- different artist cd's like this one but the real thing."
5,Outstanding hairbrush.,"This brush was expensive but that is what you expect with QUALITY. If you want a hairbrush that does an excellent job brushing your hair witout causing damage, then it's well worth the money. I expect this brush to last many years. This brush looks and performs like an expensive brush, and I have very fine delicate hair. No split ends, and shiny clean hair. Probably the LAST brush I will ever buy!"
3,"Very Good, but could be improved","Myhra has produced an excellent summary of German advanced aircraft designs during the ""Third Reich"". What sets this work apart from similar offerings by Masters and Schlick and Meyer is the coverage given to the designers of the aircraft and the companies which built them coupled with the use of colour photographs of scale models. On the down side, the book could have done with more proof reading to remove some of the repetition in the text and numerous minor typo's. It was also let down by some very poor quality illustrations, some of the line art looks like it was drawn using a ZX Spectrum home computer from the early '80's. In general the illustrations are poorly organised and of greatly variable quality. I would hope that a second edition would correct these minor flaws, a tie up with Dan Johnson's excellent web site, Luft 46 would allow the illustrations to be greatly improved."
2,wronge size,"I have ordered alot of things and this was the first time my order was not right, I am sending it back."
3,"It's nice, but not exactly what I was expecting","The ring arrived on time and in excellent condition. There's nothing necessarily wrong with the ring. The only issue is that the CZ stone sits higher on the ring than the pictures really show. It would be better if one intends to wear the ring on the ""ring finger,"" but if you intend to wear the ring on the pinkie finger, it really becomes obvious just how high off the band the stone sits. In my opinion, the height of the stone setting gives the ring a slightly more feminine look. It's a nice ring, but I'll be sending it back."
5,Buy the CD - see them live,"I sought out the first Furs CD after seeing them live - and now can't stop playing it for its original raw edge. I went to see Death Cab for Cutie with the Furs on the bill and frankly the Furs blew away Death Cab - this was a big surprise. The final driving fist of a tune at the show - India - made me check out the eponymous first CD. If you like Interpol, Static Age, even Arcade Fire, you should check out this CD. Oh, and catch them live."
1,sucks,This band does not even deserve one star. This is one of the absolute worst bands I have ever heard. Their music is horrible. If you buy the cd you might as well throw your money in the garbage. I watched them singal handedly ruin a great concert. Don't waste time or money on this band.
3,Marginally useful,"Drummond has assembled an excellent lexiography of obscenities in Russian, which would certainly prove useful in learning ""working class"" Russian. However, the potential utility of the book is limited by its lack of clarification on usage. That is to say, one has no idea how old some of the obscenities are; imagine using words like ""swell,"" ""groovy,"" or ""masher"" in contemporary speech and one gets the idea.Another shortcoming is the transliteration of some of the words: certainly many of them one would not want to use in polite conversation, but there certainly is a spectrum of vulgarity (from ""darn!"" to words that cannot be reproduced here.) Some indication of the strength of the words would have been helpful rather than a literal translation as provided here.I recommend the book, with reservations: before using any language Drummond has included, you may want to run it by a close friend first."
3,"Good, but could have been more thorough","Maybe this book's purpose is do be as concise as possible and give people a taste of French poetry. However, I thought that it could have delved a little further into certain writers and perhaps, created a fuller picture. However, from someone who bought the book a year and a half ago, it is wonderful to learn more about world literature and has certainly helped me do juist that."
4,Good book for any enabler not just for addicts,I learned alot about myself with this book. You realize what you do can actually hurt instead of help. Also it helps to show away to put yourself first.
4,"easily, quickly read","good book for the beginner in learning about enabling, and a good review for those of us who need a refresher. One I recommend to clients on occasion."
4,Book is in great condition,I have not had a chance to read this yet as I ordered several copendancy books/workbooks but look forward to reading about how i am the enabler.
4,Book needed to help the one I love,Good book. Could use a little more to it but it is very helpful. The suggestions are very helpful. Thank-you
4,Must read if you have an Enabler in your family or if you have children,We purchased this book for our family and for other family members. It is a good read to help family members who have Enablers in the family (parents) and is also good if you have children growing up and don't want to Enable them into becoming co-dependent. A good read to make sure your children grow up to have strong self esteems and to become responsible adults. Author could expand more into this area - the parent/child co-dependency area to help families out more in that area.
4,Good information in a short read.,This book was very informative in a short easy to read format. It doesn't just address enabling a spouse. There are many examples and worksheets to help a person find where their needs may be and where to start to change them.
2,updated version,this was a marvelous book to pinpoint how vague enabling can become over time. it was a captivating and very heartfelt book.
3,OK read to help open doors,This book is a good read to start to unlock those hidden doors in our lives.
5,This book was invaluable to me.,"As a true former enabler, I found this book incredibly helpful. Beginning with the opening poem, I was hooked. I studied the book carefully. The worksheets were helpful and I did them all. I had a son in treatment and need to maintain all the skills I have learned during that process (in fact, the book was recommended by the program). Through reading the book, I learned many subtle ways people enable others, and means of overcoming this destructive behavior. I am in a twelve-step recovery program, and the content in this book was a terrific adjunct to the readings and work I have done there. I highly recommend it to people with alcoholic/addicted children, spouses, partners, friends, co-workers. Enabling really does hurt the ones you love. By learning to love yourself more and develop healthy boundaries, you actually nourish the ones you love and set them free to discover who they are."
1,"Wow, wait, what?","Clinical depression, apparently, is a choice that anyone can bootstrap themselves out of when they are ""ready to feel better.""Caretakers of depressed dependents have every right to withdraw their assistance as they see fit, but not to belittle and misrepresent a disease that is stigmatized enough as it is.The same chapter reveals the secret to beating alcoholism: don't drink alcohol. While that's... true, tautologies rarely translate into useful advice.But perhaps I misunderstand the title. The book itself is the ideal Enabler for anyone who is already arranging to give their loved ones the ol' heave-ho and is in search of some comforting prose to back up that decision.For those looking for real advice and insight, this book lacks a certain nuance, to put it kindly."
3,"""Glengarry Glen Plaid"" redeems it completely","The piece ""Glengarry Glen Plaid"" is excerpts from the ""Land Ho!"" catalog as if written by David Mamet. The tone is absolutely perfect, possibly my favorite short piece of writing. The rest of the book is very hit and miss, unfortunately, although I suspect some of the problem is that the rest of it hasn't aged well."
5,Nissan Cup Insulator the greatest invention,"I travel a great deal. For years, I carried an insulated cup I bought at Starbuck's. Unfortunately, it got very messy and I found it difficult to keep it clean in hotel rooms.The Nissan Cup Insulator solves my problems. I just place my nice fresh 16 or 20 ounce paper coffee cup into the insulator and away I go. When I'm done, I just throw away the cup and the insulator doesn't need to be cleaned so I can just put it in my bag and I'm off.Starbuck's could make a fortune selling these things.MDR"
4,Simply Great!,What can I say but it really works great.Actually better than some insulated travel mugs that I have owned.
5,A perfect thing!,"There are a few things that simply could not be improved upon. This is one of them. Takes a veinte cup and keeps it hot for hours. (It is said to take 16-oz cups too, but as a hard-core coffee drinker I could not attest to that:)"
3,Thermos Paper cup insulator,"I haven't had a chance to use this product yet, however, I also purchased a Thermos Nissan can insulator, and that product is fantastic. If the can insulator can keep canned soda cold for a long time, I have not doubt that the Paper cup insulator will do the same for hot beverages. One thought I had though, I probably should have purchased the one with a lid and just pour my coffee into it. That's why I rated it only 3 stars because you need to use a paper cup. My fault - just wasn't thinking. But again, I'm basing my review on my experience with the can insulator."
1,Worst Book EVER for Logt.,no work bank at the end.index sucks.structure of the book is one long run-on sentence after another.there IS no structure to this book you can't find anything.Author never Really explains anything important and rants about outdated minutia.book is clearly not up to date.even in the summery you can tell the author avoids specifics.a giant Don't Buy!How can I get paid to write crap.even my professor stated he will not use this book again
4,Tough and honest,"This is not the greatest of situations for my famiy, but this book helped all of us make it through in the best way possible. While reading about how to make it 'easiest' on my son, I also learned the best way to make it easiest on myself. I highly recommend this book."
4,Fun book. Samuel Noah Kramer suggested a similar,"but less elaborate hypothesis in his History Begins at Sumer. Kramer thought Jews could be identified as ""habiru""(he's not the only one who thinks habiru is awfully close to hebrew.) Kramer also suggested that the habiru are Sumerians, [or forerunners of the Sumerians], driven west by Akkadian [or Sumerian] conquest. Using like reasoning, Sassoon argues Jews would not then in origin be Semitic. [I may have details misremembered, it's been a few years.]Sassoon credits Sumerians[Jews?] with superior ability and purpose, which shall be for everyone's benefit. [This may well be true in my opinion.] [I'm not Jewish, I'm not tooting the horn of my ethnic group.]Beautiful pictures are in this book."
5,Superb study of unintended consequences,"This book is a real gem. It is an excellent commentary on how idealists deny human nature and obsessively work to influence and shape social institutions ""to make things right,"" and how their good intentions almost always lead to disastrous unintended consequences. But do they learn from their mistakes? No, they just keep on trying...The Lathe of Heaven should be required reading in this time of political correctness, when so many people are obsessed with equality at all costs. This book shows how bleak such a reality would be.If you enjoy fiction that has strong social commentary (think Lord of the Flies, 1984, Brave New World), then this book is for you. Very highly recommended."
4,An interesting vision of reality,"This is about a man who has what he calls 'effective' dreams sometimes. These dreams actually change reality. He fears this ability and tries his best to prevent himself from dreaming. For various reasons he is placed in the care of a doctor who does hypnotherapy and dream research. See where this is going? I wasn't as happy with the ending as I would have liked, but the plot is very interesting and it will get you thinking."
5,An amazing novel,"I had to get this book for English class, it is the kind of thing that I might not have read on my own... the title is interesting but the cover is a little abstract if you don't know the story. Having read it I can highly recommend it. It is an interesting book with a lot of meaning to it, the whole class had a lot of fun analyzing it, I even went so far as to find and watch the two television/movie adaptions that have been made - neither one does this book justice. If you like interesting, thought provoking speculative fiction look no further, for star-ships and space battles you might want to go elsewhere (even though this book does have a little of those). It isn't very long so a serious reader will probably only take an afternoon on this but do not confuse the size of the book with the size of the meaning that it contains, this is a very deep book."
3,.. have I read this before?,"Interesting enough premise and plot, but in the end it just feels a bit like a second rate PKD novel. The writing is pretty crude and the characters are utterly uninteresting.Excellent title, though."
3,Superlative conception; inadequate execution...,"Like its protagonist (Dr. Haber), this novel ultimately fails due to the paucity of imaginative means that are brought to bear in pursuit of its conceptually magnificent ends. And, unfortunately, in art, as one of the characters puts it: ""All we have is means."" In any case, a very charming meditation on the nature of reality and the mind's place in it - announced by the jellyfish/ocean allegory in the opening paragraphs - disintegrates, like Dr. Haber's attempts at remaking the World, into an incoherent and unsatisfactory welter of unnecessary characters (e.g. Heather Laleche) and events. Le Guin should have given herself a lot more time writing this one."
2,Dreams and reality in an amazing story.,"A haunting mythic story of a man whose dreams can create an alternate reality. He struggles with a over-ambitious medical researcher over control of his brain, to remain in touch with the woman he loves, even across his alternate universes, receiving advice from aliens to keep in touch with his inner self, and ultimately struggles to learn how to use his power for good. A classic science-fiction story which appeals to utopian ideals."
3,"Interesting, but a weak ending","I am an avid LeGuin fan, but although I enjoyed most of this book, the ending was rather weak. _A Fisherman of the Inland Sea_ and _The Disposessed_ are definitely superior to this work."
3,a tepid dream,"leguin's writing has occasional flashes of poetry,but there's really not much to this book outside the main concept. reminds me of philip k dick's work except the characters do not feel REAL. the reader never really feels any sympathy for george--at least i didnt. and if youve read a lot of sf the ending is easy to predict--pure pulp.still, no shame. leguin is always a fun read. won't take much time to get thru this one."
2,Good Concept but Poorly Written,"This was a required text for one of my college classes which really shouldn't have been been. Although the story is interesting, I find the book to be poorly written with so many grammatical and punctuation errors. The characters sounded like morons and I found some parts of the plot to be corny. I honestly don't understand how this book got published and wonder if anybody edited this book."
2,not what it's cracked up to be,"This was my first Ursula K. LeGuin novel, and my last. After reading this I have no clue why she's gotten so much acclaim over the years. It reads like a sorry attempt to be Philip K. Dick (a genuine genius). It's a good idea poorly executed. I had to force myself to finish it.Maybe I should have tried The Left Hand of Darkness instead."
1,"Boo, boo, and more boos.",It isn't always easy to follow the author's train of thought. Then you have to get past all of her pschoprattle and philosophical nonsense. Taoism my foot.The 1980 movie based on this novel isn't worth watching either.This isn't to say that the author didn't basically have a great premise for this book. She simply didn't do it justice. If you really want to read this book borrow it from your local library like I proceeded to do. Save your money for some other book that is worth spending it on.
5,"The Honeymooners - The Lost Episodes, Boxed Set 2","As a little girl, I enjoyed watching The Honeymooners with my family. Now, as a big girl, I'm still able to enjoy watching The Honeymooners with my family. My 13-year-old son is in love with Norton!!! The best part of watching The Honeymooners now is that there are no commercials and no waiting for next week to enjoy the next episode. These episodes are timeless, rip-roaring funny and erase any and all stress from your life. I highly recommend it."
4,Love the Honeymooners!!!,The picture quality is not great but loved watching the lost episodes!!! John Herbert Gleason was an amazing comic!!! Art Carney is also special...
1,Not working with my card reader,"I had bought a Kingston 2GB flash card before and it has worked quite well. For some reason, when I inserted the 4GB card in my card reader that I have been using, my Sony VAIO computer just freezed up. I had to pull it out and restore the desktop. I also inserted the card directly in the SD drive of the computer. The computer couldn't recognize it."
2,Not working with Apple iPhoto,I brought this 4Gb memory card for use with my Canon A710 IS digital camera. Before this I had a 1Gb Kingston card and had no problems transferring the contents to iPhoto (latest version) on my MacBook Pro. The new memory card is not recognized by iPhoto. I've updated the Canon ImageBrowser software to see if it would recognize this card with no results so far. I've attempted the transfer using USB from my camera and using a USB card reader. As of this review I'm still pursuing a solution to this impasse. I've rated this product with a tentative 2 stars since there may be a simple solution out there that I've missed.
3,not compatible for some computer,"works well on my DC, but it is quite slow when transferring data. Moreover, it is not compatible for the built in card reader on my computer."
4,Good reliable product,"A good, solid reliable product by Kingston. Using it in my GPS system for additional disk space. Have been using the SD card for a month now with no problems - not to mention the GPS unit does get tossed around in the car quiet often but no complains on the performance of the SD card.Highly recommended."
2,the card that no one can read,I have yet to find a computer or cardreader that can read this card. So far I have had to hook up my camera (Canon SD800is) and download the pictures from there. I have also found that this card does not work in all cameras. If I had to do it again I would get more smaller cards and save myself the hassle of the card not reading.
1,Unusable,"Didn't work in any device I tried it in. I had discarded the packinging, trusting in all the good reviews I read here, so can't even return it. Won't be buying anything else from Kingston."
3,Be careful about compatibility,"This is probably a good product. But be careful that it is a NEW standard (High Capacity) SD card and will NOT be compatible with regular SD devices. I found out after ordering it and plugging it into my device, so I had to return it."
5,Lots of storage,"Nice compact way to store a decent amount of data. Make sure whatever device you want to put it in can handle SD HC - not just HC. This works fine with my computer - wont work at all in my digital picture frame.That's not a knock on the product, but buyers just need to be aware."
3,"Basic, good value for the price","This is a basic, baseline model for SD cards that should suffice for most cameras that don't shoot:1) large RAW2) HD Vids3) Continuous shots.It's a slow card, but it's super cheap. If your needs are higher, then of course, go for higher speed Class 6 or higher cards, but expect to pay more."
3,card few card readers can read,"Nice card but ... few card readers can actually read it. ""64 in 1"" I bought recently could not read it.Be prepare to spend extra buck for the reader."
4,Best Card Provided by kingston,Its really a great deal that I got from amazon.Excellent service from amazon.About the product its a close eyes deal no doubt about that.My advice would be go for it & have fun.EnjoyAni
3,Mine Might Be Defective...,"This memory card works fine in my FujiFilm FinePix S700, but it doesn't work in my other smaller point-and-shoot cameras. Also, my laptop can take files directly from any SD card and place photographs from there onto the hard drive, but this particular card doesn't ""take"" when inserted. It's like nothing is there. I have to use the USB cable in order to upload my photos. Just a small extra step, but still a bit of a pain.I would recommend this card for people that have cameras larger than point-and-shoots, since it works fine on those (in my experience). If you have a small, compact camera, I would recommend SanDisk memory cards instead of Kingston."
4,good for the price,"I needed a pretty big memory card, but the reload and storage speeds were not a factor. This being the case, this card has been perfect so far. Holds a lot of pics and videos, and doesnt really take too long to store em and be set for the next picture/ vid."
4,"great card.. I think, but it won't work with older camers","I'm sure this memory card is great: But note, it didn't work with my Cannon PowerShot SD450 - this maybe due to the card, but I think that older cameras don't support the ""HC"" card technology. The packaging and fine details don't really tell you how to determine this though..."
1,The price IS too good to be true; mine was a lemon,"I bought this with my Canon a570. The camera is fantastic, but the card is another story. It worked fine at first, but a month later, I went to India and now half of my pictures are missing, replaced with a question mark and a message that says 'unidentified image'. Now the card doesn't hold anything, I get a message that says 'memory card error'. I'm going to spend a little more for a more reliable brand this time."
5,Does what it's supposed to,Seems to do the trick for storing photos from my DSLR. Fast enough that it can keep up with continuous shooting on my D40x in all but RAW mode. Large enough to hold plenty of images without changing cards.
1,The card just doesn't work,"I bought this card together with Canon G7 digital camera. This flash card was working for two days, and then it was broken suddenly. The camera displays error message, doesn't allow making shots, and even doesn't allow formatting the card; but the camera works perfectly with another card. I tried to insert this broken card in my PC, but the PC cannot recognize the card as well.Since I live outside the U.S., it doesn't make a sense to return this card back to Amazon because of transportation cost. So I just lost my money."
5,4 GB SD,That was the best thing for me to do is buy this 4GB sd.You never have to worry about running out of space. and is fast too
4,Good stuff,Good quality SD card. I just figure out that all my card reader are too old and can't read SDHC card only SD...
2,disappointing,"I have read a lot of Zacks poetry and thought that he had a lot of raw talent. Raw talent in poetry can be effective, but in a book it just comes across as bad writing. He needs to hone his skills and try again."
2,Celi Bee Greatest Hits,"I love the content of the CD, but my CD arrived completely water damaged, with the cover and j-card content absolutely destroyed. I was shocked to receive the CD from this seller in such poor condition. The seller is also slow to ship as well. Buyer beware."
5,Just what I wanted...,This case is exactly what I wanted. It's not big and bulky but protects my GPS.
4,TomTom Case,I really like this case. It has just the right firmness to protect my Tom Tom but is not too hard to make it too ridgid for carrying in my pocket or purse. The closure zipper seems well constructed and should last a long time. I am very satisfied.
2,Tom Tom One Carry Case and Strap,I purchased this case for our new tom tom one xl gps and had to return it because our gps would not fit in it because of the extra wide screen. I purchased the deluxe carrying case and it fit perfectly. Maybe this case would fit one of the other Tom Tom gps systems fine.
4,Tom Tom one and South Africa Maps,I purchased the Tom Tom One with maps for south Africa for a planned trip over christmas. The unit arrives with U.s. and Canada maps in memory and it was necessary for me to down load the SA maps into the Tom Tom one.the girls at the tach support desk at Tom Tom talked me thru this procedure while on the phone with them. I can only say tech support with this company is outstanding. I will update my review when I return from SA and let you know how it performed. Regards.Wayne.
2,Cheesy case,"I was extremely disappointed in this product. Material is cheap,and it comes with a lanyard with no loop to attach it to. I had to attach the lanyard to the hole in the zipper pull, and it is just awkward to handle."
3,"Does the job, no bells and whistles though","I received a TomTomOne as a gift but I didn't get anything to protect it in, especially when it's in my glove compartment. This product has a pretty hard outer shell to protect, but that's about it. For the price, I expected more. Shop around a bit more, before you decide on this one, I wish I did."
2,Dissapointing,"The case does what it is supposed to do, is useful in keeping the GPS unit from getting broken and should have been included with the GPS unit in the first place. The strap on the other hand came apart while I was attaching it to the GPS unit. Fortunately I didn't actually use it to cary the Tom Tom or I'd have a broken Tom Tom now. I tried to get a replacement from Tom Tom and they wouldn't even answer my my email. In short, The Strap is Crap! If you buy the case which comes with the strap, don't be foolish enough to use it."
4,"does its job, is not perfect","The case fits the TomTom really well, I don't see much use for the strap though. The case has a little velcro pocket inside for an extra SD card, but when the card is in it, it catches on the unit when you take it out. Could have been more thought through. Otherwise, it does it's job perfectly, makes it really easy to cary your TomTom with you."
3,Not bad.,It has a good fit for my Tomtom One. But I don't think it does it's job on protecting the GPS from damage since the case is thin and not as durable as I'm expecting. But it's cute and handy.
4,real good stuff,This case is a real good bargain: excellent material and it was fabricated carefully with good attention to the details like the logo that appears not too evident.
5,It's worth it,"The TomTom One does need a carry case, as I suspect all GPS navigation units do, to protect the sensitive touch screen when not in use. The basic carrying case is all you need."
5,Tom Tom is a winner,I had seen this product used before buying and was impressed. More impressed now that I own it. It does everything I expected and more.
3,Good socks but pattern frays,"I have several pairs of these. They are comfortable and wear well. The only gripe I have is the pattern tends to fray slightly, leading to a threadbare look on the edges of the diamonds. All in all for the price, I would not purchase again. If they were half the price, I would definitely buy due to comfort and durability."
2,Disappointing,"These guys make such a bewildering array of products that when you find one that meets your needs, you can never find more of the same kind. They should number their socks or something - ""Style Number 314683"" or the like, if they even make the same kind of sock, with the same texture and material and weight, for more than two months in a row. It's a pain, because if I don't wear wool socks my feet hurt, and they used to be very reliable."
5,"Love all my Smartwool socks,","best i've had, just have to take care of them. So much better on the old feet. I keep buying them"
5,Read it devotionally - and worship God!,"This is a great theology book, doctrinally very good and solidly evangelical. What it unique is that this book can be read devotionally. Read if prayerfully, slowly and asking God to change your heart. He will draw you to Himself as you pursue Him in this book. It does not replace bible reading, and no book ever could or should, but you can learn more about God by studying this book."
5,Helpful,I purchased this for my son who is a pastor who was thrilled when given to him. It was highly recommended by my pastor. The day I received it I read the chapter on the Holy Spirit and was quite impressed.
3,It's a good basic systematic theology.,"This is a very thorough volume for systematic theology. I like that he, at least on the surface level, presents his as well as differing opinions. However, while he claims to write from an unbiased point of view, it is just not the case. As long as you agree with his 100% reformed theological opinion, you will enjoy it. However, at times he will present all opinions with a much longer section on his baised area, and then return later to condemn other opinions as uneducated. There were areas that I as a Baptist minister strongly disagreed with him. If you are a 5 point Calvinist, you will enjoy it, however."
5,Grudem's section on God's attributes is top notch!,"I have been teaching God-centered approaches to theology in seminary in Taiwan and picked up Grudem recently. His section on the attributes of God, the image of God in man and the Trinity were very well done and should be read by all believers seeking to grow in the grace and knowledge of God. I think these parts give the finest readable, devotional treatments of these subjects I've ever read. Very thorough treatment of the views of biblical creation too! I look forward to studying this work more carefully to integrate his fresh ideas on God's character and glory with my seminary teaching!"
5,Grudem's Systematic Theology,This is a great book that has inspired me to gift it to other friends of mine.I would highly recommend this book to many.Thank you for your expedient service in delivering it.Luigi Vendittelli
1,Standard evangelical traditions you have heard countless times before....,"No need to waste your money (that is what Wayne gets out of it). You have heard it all before ad nauseum.We need men of God with power - not more men with the same words that have been uttered countless times in countless ways for countless centuries.You don't need dissecting of human reasoning to know Jesus - you need the Holy Spirit - and you won't find that reading a book other than the Word of God with a submitted heart.It is really a waste of time unless you want to be able to talk systematic-ease with other evangelical theology nerds - in that case, just about any systematic will do - they all say the same thing with different words. But is that really what you think the call of God is? Is that what you want your life to be about??"
1,One confused individual,"Calvinistic, charismatic, and evangelical all into one. This is all totally inconsistent. One cannot be an evangelical Calvinist (look into the PCA or any conservative Presbyterian congregation to prove my point. It is a total oxymoron)-- and especially a loony Pentecostal, but somehow Grudem managed to mesh them all together and everyone thinks this is a great work.No wonder a slip shod seminary like Trinity in Illinois would use this as a required text. It makes everyone feel good because it is something for everyone. What is this? A Campus Crusade for Christ meeting? Jeez! Talk about the tickling of ears."
2,Stealth Charismatic under the Guise of Reformed,Grudem's failings on the doctrine of Scripture slowly poison the rest of the work.
5,Excelent,"Great writing, not over the top. Covers the topics well and gives opposing views. A good purchase for a tough class in seminary"
5,Great Introduction,"As far as a systematic theology introduction goes I enjoyed it very much. Clear, well written, presents various opinions fairly.I thought the Trinity and Christology (especially the 2 natures in one person) were a little shallow and could use a bit more material.Of course you'll find doctrines (eternal subordination of the Son to the Father comes to mind) and opinions you don't agree with but it's good to engage with others who think different.I liked the hymns, general devotional tone and questions at the end.Thanks Wayne."
5,Great for College Student!,"I don't think I could praise this book enough in a few sentences. Grudem clearly lays out the truth on what the Bible teaches on any given subject. Where there are common differences he tends to explain each viewpoint, but is honest about which view he personally holds, and why. As a college student discovering for the first time how real God was, I found this book an amazing window into some punchin' truth. Really practical for anyone on a quest to know God more. Asks tough questions like, ""If God controls all things, how can our actions have real meaning?"" ""Why does God want us to pray?"" ""When and why did God choose us? Are some not chosen?"" ""Can true Christians lose their salvation?"" ""Should women serve as pastors of churches?"" ""What are spiritual gifts? How many are there?"" So get this one! Good for reading cover to cover, or for reference."
5,The Christian go to book,One of my very favorites books for fast straight forward answers. It is filled with understandable & thoughtful explainations of many CHRISTIAN principles. Don't buy it unless you are serious or need a new paper weight.
5,Excellent first time study,I'm not a theologian and not a pastor -- just an evangelical believer. Grudem's book is a top rate reference for me. I enjoy the end-of-chapter questions and devotional materials. A1+. (What's with all of these limey reviewer's panning the book? Is there a better Brit theology book out there?)
5,Grudem Systematic Theology,In great shape!!!! I am impressed by how great of shape the book is in for the low price. It saved me from buying it from our over-price college bookstore.
2,not what I expected,"The best thing about this book is the author's ability to explain something clearly. He also gets an A for organization. It's part of the content that I have a problem with. Much of this work on the various aspects of Christianity is reasonable and sensible, but the chapter on Election and Reprobation is awash in Calvanistic views that are very controversial and largely unacceptable to me personally."
4,Good quality,"the book was in great shape, it shipped when it was supposed to, it was good service and ya"
2,"1) Lack of Reasoning and Analysis on his conclusions, and 2) hide Charamatic view under the cover of Reformed","The author did not present his claims or conclusions based on any analysis of the related portions of the scripture with any reasoning. He just made his claims/conclusions and ehn threw out a lot of quotes from the scripture without any analysis or explanation of why he made such conclusions.Since the author involved deeply in the charamatic movements, he put his charamatic view under the cover of reformer. It is well hidden in those chapters about miracles and baptism in and filling with holy spirit. Where he advocates readers to accept the charamatic view inside their churches in a very soft and hidden tones. That is, this book could be a slow poison for the reformed churches (non-Pentecostal churches).There are a lot of verbeage in this book. The author could present all his views/conclusions with less than 400 pages instead of over 1200 pages."
1,One sided and based on assumptions,"This book's chief problems as far as I can tell are its stereotyping of other christian denominations and its use of anecdotal evidence. The book is basically a manual for Reformed Theology in the contemporary world and as such, is very conservative. When this book does offer contrasting viewpoints to those held by the author, they are not well presented and are usually brushed off with single references to the Bible. Also, since it is systematic rather than process there are contradictions on every page that arise from the inexhaustible attempt to proven Reformed doctrines by biblical cherry picking. In addition, although this is symptomatic of the entire Evangelical community, all or most of these doctrines are backed up by Paul's letters and almost nothing is deduced from the Gospels themselves."
1,Systematic proof texting,"Wayne Grudem is often hailed as the common mans theologian. He has attempted to create and accessible and readable systematic theology. Grudems certainly achieves this, however, it is unfortunate that the book is simply bad. Its use of poor prose and systematic proof texting means that the books is an uncontrable waste of money. In Grudems attempts to render the book accessible he simply strings a long list of verses together with some rather flimsy, superficial exergesis. It has been and will continue to be a popular book within charasmatic circles due to Grudems stance on tongues, yet what ever you wish to believe about that and other controversial issues there are better books to buy."
5,Serious Bible study,"This is the next logical step for studying the Bible and to date, it has more than met my expectations. I would highly reccommend this book for all serious Bible studies."
5,Recommended,"This is the best Theology book I have read. The doctrines in this book are much more Biblically supported than others Theologies, such as The Moody handbook of Theology. Wayne Grudem did a very thorough job in writing this book. It can also be used well for devotionals or Bible studies, because of the way it is written. It is Biblical,and is therefore, conservative."
4,Non-Tolkien scholars or non-linguists need not apply!,"this text is very interesting. it covers the linguistics of the languages of tolkien very well, and is trade-paper published. i like it a lot. however, as the other reviewer pointed out, it predates silmarillion and needs to be updated drastically."
4,Great cleaner.,"Great spray that requires little scrubbing. Works great with q-tips for the tricky areas, as well as passes with a BoreSnake."
3,A time saver,I use this on my AK and AR it does cut time on the internal pieces and the barrel but I would recommend a Hoppes #9 follow up as I still find residue.
3,"Screw lids are fine for food jar, but not for a coffee mug","Although Thermos Nissan products are among the best vaccuum insulated containers on the market, this dual purpose jar falls short due to its attempt to be dual purpose. As a food jar it is great. But as a coffee/drink mug it becomes less useful on account of what makes it such a good food jar -- that is, the screw on top design. Remember, there are two tops that come with this jar, and both must be screwed on when used. That's fine for a food jar that you want to make sure your noodles and soup don't escape due to a pressure fit lid accident. But a screw top design for a coffee mug is inconvenient. In short, if you want a food jar this product will work great. But if you are primarily interested in a coffee/drink mug, a better product would be the Timolino 20 oz. @tanium II Travel Mug."
1,Food Jar/Mug Unfit as a Mug,"I had been looking long and hard for a good insulated coffee mug that would not easily tip over to replace my old mug that tipped over regulalry. When I found this one I thought, ""Finally a decent mug to buy!"". I loved the handle and the way it kept the coffee warm, but it it totally unusable! The lid does not seal well. Efforts to tighten the lid down further to reduce leakage result in stripped threads. Now the lid won't tighten at all! It leaks horribly. My poor white shirt stained by it! Pass on this one until they redesign the lid! Otherwise it's great. If only the lid actually sealed! Grrrrrr."
1,Lid leaks all over clothes,"The size on this is ok and it certainly keeps your coffee hot. Unfortuntely the screw top lid is not an actual screw but rather a partial screw, where 1/2 twist closes it and 3/4 twist pops the seal. It constantly leaks to the side of the lid, usually all over my clothes. I'm tossing it and regret the $20.00 lost."
3,Thermos Nissan JMF502 16-Ounce Stainless Steel Insulated Dual Purpose Food Jar,It keeps everything hot for a long time. The food jar is a 5 star the coffee top leaks and is a one star. I will be contacting the manufacturer.
5,A MUST HAVE!,"Because we have 2 dogs and 4 cats, often separation is a necessary thing. This gate is perfect! Well constructed and the perfect size for our doorway. Would recommend it for anyone looking for a pet gate - would NOT be good for kids - possibly a safety issue as it doesn't bolt to the wall."
5,"Perfect for keeping the dogs out of the ""cat cave""",We bought this to keep the dogs out of the room where we keep the cat food and litter boxes. Perfect and well made. Worth the extra money to have a substantial gate that you can walk through. The cat door opens either way depending upon how you set up the gate. Easy to put together and take down.
3,Bars are pretty far apart,"The gate went up just fine and seems to hold well enough without screwing on the provided wall cups. The opening/closing mechanism requires paying attention, but does the job. As soon as I finished putting it up our 3 month-old Westie puppy went right through it between the bars. The bars are not a uniform distance apart and where they curve the space is just big enough for her. I zip-tied on some hardware cloth and now she can't get through. That added $15 to the cost of the item and did not improve its looks, but it's ok where we have it."
2,Our large toddler fits through the pet door!,"We bought this walk thru gate to give our cat access to the basement while keeping our (very large for his age) toddler away from the stairs. Much to our amazement, he managed to squeeze through the pet gate. He's 13 months old, but very tall and heavy for his age (95th percentile). So I can't really give this more than 2 stars since it presents a significant safety risk for toddlers. We're going to keep it since at least it gives us a bit more time to chase our boy down while he's trying to make his way through the pet gate as opposed to having nothing, but overall we're disappointed with this product and can't recommend it."
5,I love this gate!,"Finally -- a way to keep my geriatric dog out and my cat able to go back and forth. This was a breeze to install -- no tools needed. Fits very well. I like the white enamel, rubber suction circles that don't mar the doorway jam and that it lets light through the doorway. Easy for me to get in and out with gate. The price is very good. Would highly recommend."
4,Good gate!,"Pretty good gate, not super sturdy but does the job for my dog! It wasn't difficult to put together and didn't have too many parts"
5,Nice Pet Gate,"This gate is fantastic, very easy to put together and put in place. Very well built and designed and keeps are toy poodle out of the bedrooms."
5,Great Gate!,"This gate is great! We have a 3 year old chocolate lab who can actually get up on top of the refrigerator. We installed this gate, and he cannot get through! I wish I bought this gate years ago. I highly recommend this gate!"
5,Great Gate,Very pleased with this purchase. Works perfect. The added advantage of being able to add extensions makes it even better.Getting to old for the step over gate type. This is wonderful and easy to put together and install.
4,well built unit,Unboxed it and think it is a well built unit. Was shipped faster than I thought by normal ship. Pleased with product and service.
4,works great for keeping dog away from the cat,"This gate works great. The cat now has a couple of quiet places to retreat to when the dog becomes too lively. Be advised though that our 32 lb dog got through the cat door easily until we fixed a piece of wood coming down from the top of the opening to make it smaller by about 4 inches.The dog could also get under the opening of our original flexible gate. This new gate has bar at the bottom that makes a dog proof connection with the door. You will trip over once or twice, but it works."
5,Fantastic item. Ibought this so that my new dog could not get upstairs and torment the cats.,Such a wonderful idea.I have two small children and this gate is easy enough for my 3 year old...The cats are not afraid to use the smaller entry and my dog will not jump or crash it.It sits at the base of my stairs and protects all!..the assembly is a snap and the price is perfect!
5,So Pleased I Bought This Gate!,"This gate solved a problem for me. I have two large collies who think that repairmen and visitors that come to my home are there to visit them. They are so happy that we have a visitor they do not leave them alone. They actually think they are helping the repairman by kissing him, bringing their toys....he cannot get his work accomplished.By purchasing the gate, they can stay in a large room with their beds and toys and some treats. It has worked out perfectly...the little doggie door lets my cat visit them.This gate is solid, well-built and much better looking than a wood gate. It includes two extensions in case you want to move it to a larger opening. I especially appreciate the walk-through door when the gate is not being used. It is also tall enough that my collies cannot jump over it!I recommend it highly."
4,Walk Thru Gate with Pet Door,"We really like this gate it is perfect at the top of our stairs. Easy to install and sturdy. The only thing we noticed is the pet door is rather large if you only have cats, we had to ""modify"" ours a bit to keep our 10 month old son from going through it as well. All in all though, very nice product and worth the price."
5,Great Pet Door with Gate,"We bought one of these gates last year and it worked so well, we bought another one to use on a different door to keep our dog limited to tile areas while we were out. Simple to put together, sturdy, and the gate feature is great. No more stepping over the old gate we had. Doesn't damage walls and easy to move if needed."
4,Very good,"This gate is very good and easy installation. Was a little slow to ship but it did make it before the scheduled date so I can't ding them on that. The only complaint is that the small door is not quite small enough to keep my 35 pound dog from going through it. It took me about 5 minutes to cut out one bar in the door, clean it up and paint it, and now it works beautifully. The cat is free to eat on the floor of the laundry room again and the two dogs can only sit there and drool. Well worth the money and beats cutting holes in doors. Good product."
2,Not a great gate...,"It's flemsy when you put the extensions on. I have a daycare and any time the kids bump it, it falls off. We took it down because it kept falling and that was more dangerous than not having one. It got to a point where it would fall even when you were opening the gate to go through. Also people kept tripping on the metal piece on the bottom every time they went through. I would not purchase this item again specially for how much they charge."
3,I Don't Know,"I like having the swing gate instead of putting up and taking down a regular baby gate. It might be in the product description or other reviews, but I missed the part where you have to screw something into the wall to mount this gate into. They are like little cups that hold the gate in place. I didn't use the cups though, and the gate still works. However, sometimes one of the dogs leans on the gate, and I have to put it back into place. I decided not to use them because I didn't want my nice wood doorway ruined with screw holes.The cat door is useful, but I wished the it slide over. When I have the cat door open in one direction and forget to close it before opening the big gate, it can scratch the door. When it is open the other direction, I have to make sure not to scratch my leg.However, overall, it is nicer than the regular baby gates. It is lot more sturdy. My dogs were leaning on and breaking the traditional wooden gates, and these gates have stood strong against them."
5,gates for cats that protect litter boxes from dogs over 30 lbs,"Carlson 0930PW Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate with Pet Door, WhiteI LOVE it. My dog Penny is frustrated but I have much less litter tracked in the house as Penny can no longer use the litter box as a snack tray. The gate is sturdy, easy to install and easy for the cats and I to get through. I do tie the cat door in a partially closed position as a smaller dog can wiggle through if I don't.I had one before and I deliberately went looking for another one when I moved and rearranged the litter boxes. I have no reservations about recommending it."
5,100% satisfied.,"I was impressed with how quickly item arrived. We have a dog and cats, the dog would not stop eating cat food, so we put cat food in room with the gate at the door. Problem solved dog can't get through the pet door but cats can."
4,Really Just What We Needed,"I purchased this gate at a pet store (on sale!) and it is pretty much exactly what we needed to keep my 50# dog away from the cats. The cats easily learned to go through the cat door and the cat door IS too small for my shepherd-sheltie mix to get through. It really works exactly as I need it to. My only ""complaint"" is minimal...the handle to open and close the people-door is a bit awkward. But I'd buy the gate again and I'll recommend to anyone who needs this type of gate."
5,Just for pets,"I purchased this gate to place in my living room doorway to keep in my 14 month old visiting granddaughter, but let the cat escape when he felt the need. It was easy to install, but I ran into a problem with my doorway. There is a trim detail on the wall, and that prevents the ends of the threaded spindle rods from sitting flat on the wall. I decided to give it a try anyway since I would be in the room w/ her. Before she came to visit, the cat and I gave it a test run, and he got the idea and went right through the first time. We were most surprised (and highly amused) when my ""webble shaped"" granddaughter followed him right through on her first visit.-YIKES. The gate only opens in one direction, so before you install make a choice. My 4 1/2 year old grandson can open the gate w/out any help, even if the ""lock"" tab is engaged, less getting up for grandma. As with all presure/open gates there is a bar on the bottom so you must be careful walking through."
5,A MUST for introducing a dog into a house with cats,"I bought one when I brought my new collie into a house with two kitties. The gate works perfectly, so much so that I immediately ordered another. Great for the cats, since they figured out that they can watch the dog from the other side, and even go examine her up close, and know that they can escape if they get scared. The dog can't knock it down, jump over it, or get through the door. The cats found the door immediately. All together great."
4,Good pet door; not the best baby AND pet door,"We use at the top of our basement steps to allow our cats access to their litter box and to keep our 1-year-old from falling down the stairs. Our cats are quite tubby and the pet door is plenty large to allow them to easily fit through. It's also large enough for our daughter to fit through; at the moment she's not interested in crawling through so we're temporarily lucky. The people door is a bit narrow compared to our other baby gates - we're slim so we fit through fine but others have had to turn to the side slightly to comfortably walk through the door. The latch can't be opened with one hand which is a bit of a bother when I'm holding my daughter. I did like how it came with extensions to fit most door openings. With other gates I've had to separately purchase extensions. I recommend this if you're just going to use it as a pet gate. If you want to use it as a pet and baby gate, consider how curious your child is first."
3,Nice quality but not for small dogs!,This gate looked great in theory but if you have a small dog beware! My puppy is 5 lbs and squeezed right through the bars!
3,Dog gate,"I purchased this gate for my entryway into my kitchen area. It's quality is not the best, but works out for my situation to keep my 3 Boston Terriers contained in the kitchen area for a period of time in the day. The door that opens and shuts is somewhat narrow, but other than that works well."
5,Wow!,"Just what we needed to keep the dog contained while letting the cat the ability to get through. It's been in place for about a year now with no problems. To be honest, the cat could clear the top of it if she wanted to, so it don't expect it to keep a cat in, unless you have a couch potato cat. Very happy with the product. Installs easily and I would recommend the product."
4,"Not a bad gate, a little frustrating to setup but its good if you need a gate to permately stay up","Its not a bad gate, it works great and its a good price! Its really frustrating to put up! (its not hard, its just frustrating) oh and dont think the gate is broken if you see a gap in the handle, it comes together when you put the caps in the wall. Its a good buy!"
4,Decent Product,"The most important thing to know about this gate, compared to similar ones, is that it requires you to use anchors in your wall to secure the gripper cups for the tension rods. You simply cannot get the gate tight enough otherwise. Personally that is kind of irritating because we like to periodically move the gate to different areas of the house and this makes it more permanent. Also, as mentioned by other reviewers, the walk thru gate is very narrow. Otherwise it has been a great gate for keeping the big dogs in a particular room while allowing the older cats (who no longer jump) free access."
4,Loved the gate but not meant for small dogs,This product works great and overall was easy to set up.I purposely bought this because he had a door so I could walk through it easily unlike other gates that I constantly had to take down or step over.The locking mechanism doesn't actually have to be used. I found it just annoying and my dog didn't really have the power or capability to break the door down.The only problem I found is that between the door and the next bar over my dog can squeeze through very easily. I'm pretty sure that this gate was not meant to be used for smaller dogs. Just keep that in mind before purchasing.(I have a dog smaller than 10 lbs. I was dreaming to think this gate would keep him out but I gave it a try)I tried letting my dog go through the small door but he could never figure out it was open. So instead if I don't lock the gate(push the handle down) he just pushes the gate open and goes in and out.
5,Great Gate,We have four large dogs and have used this gate to keep them upstairs. It works perfectly. Easy in and easy out. No damage to the walls. Holds firmly. It's really a great gate. Thinking of getting another when my little nieces come to visit. Great for dogs and certainly great for toddlers too.
5,Just what we needed!,"Easy to set up. Very sturdy, even without the wall cups. Got this for a great price, and it has given our cats a haven away from the new doggie in the house. Cat door is rather large, which is fine for us (80 lb golden retriever), but would not be usable with a smaller breed. Walk-through gate is fairly narrow, just FYI. Husband is 6'9"", 300 lbs, and has to step sideways through the gate. Still, this gate does the job as promised, and we are happy with the purchase."
4,Pet Gate,"This gate is superior to the wooden bunk-bed baseboard my parents were using to keep the dog from going downstairs and harassing the cats. Now the cats can come and go as they please while the dog is barricaded upstairs. Biggest con is that the cat door is not removable and it really bothers me that I cannot easily take it off. If you have a wide body, do not purchase as the walk-through space is narrow. Highly recommend that you do not use the screws that come with the gate as they strip very easily. Went to Lowe's and bought some self-drilling screws for a few dollars that were superior to the cheap screws supplied with the gate. All in all, good purchase for the price."
4,great gates,The gates are a convenient way of closing off a room. nice to just open gate and walk through. Had to make a small modification for a narrower opening.
3,sturdy gate,"I really like the design and sturdiness of this gate. I'm not really good at installing things so got a friend to do it.The only real problem with it is the cat door is too big. My sheltie got thru it easily, ruining the main purpose I boughtit! I suggest you make the cat door smaller, about the size of the ones you buy for installing in doors. My dog can onlystick his head thru that one!! lol"
2,Not for small puppies!,I bought this two days ago; It is very easy to put up BUT my shih tzu is 4 months & she went right through it head first!
5,Best gate on the market!,We just had our third child and I wish I would have had this gate with the first. Arrived in two days and took 4 minutes to install. Looks really nice and not cheap. I would definitely recommend.
5,GREAT GATE,This is a great gate for children or dogs. It stays firm and lets you open it and walk through without trying to step over it. I liked it so much that I ordered 3 more to keep dogs out of other rooms.
2,"Great idea, but poor manufacturing","We bought one of these from Target locally, and found that the bottom bar of the door on the gate was welded improperly. This made closing the gate very difficult, and the pet door would not latch or swing freely. The installation was ok, though, and the idea is good. But I would try to find one locally so you can be sure it was made properly before buying."
1,Warning this is not a baby gate!,"I had bought this gate so for my cats to use and also to keep my nephew out of areas he should not be going to. I found this under baby gates search. The warning label on this product says it is not a baby gate! This would have been nice to know. My 18 mos nephew was able to fit through the small pet door. I still have it to keep my cats from bothering me in the morning but this is only for pets, not kids."
2,Pet Gate Fail!,I guess you get what you pay for. The gate was cheap in every way. It does not lock securely into the door frame. If the plastic pieces on the end were made from rubber instead of plastic it might grip better but I can pull it out of the door frame pretty easily. When my dog gets bigger I'm sure she'll be able to knock it down with no problem. Also the little pet door is HUGE and had to be modified so the dog couldn't squeeze through. I should have just gotten a baby gate and modified it so my cats can fit through.
4,Gate,We purchased this gate because it is the only baby gate out there with a pet door. it took about 5 minutes to install and our cats immediately figured it out. It works great to keep our 1 year old son out. he can squeeze through (tight fit) the cat door but doesn't try unless we're in that room so no big deal. overall think it is a great product.
1,missing parts,"Item was shipped fast, and as expected, but missing the hand wheels that make sure the gate is secure in doorway. So I am stuck with a gate that I cannot use because of missing pieces"
1,not for SMALL dogs,First off the door was broken and wouldn't lach when the gate was received but we got past that.I bought this gate for a 5lb mali poo puppy who was able to escape through each rail without any effort. This gate is not for small dogs as they can squeeze through the panels very easily.
1,Wasted 4 hrs trying to get this thing to work,"Ijust dont get it...with all the positive reviews. The one I have is the 0530pw model. It cant be much different than the model here. Looks the same and seems like its supposed to operate the same. Iam a contractor and used to handling issues with tools and different items. I have put together countless toys and furniture pieces as well, with no problem. This thing just wont go for me. And I just dont understand why. I can get it to stay firm on the wall but soon as I try to open the door, wham it falls apart. Not only that but the bottom will not line up for the door to close. I was all ready to accept that issue and just use it with that out of allinment but I cant even do that. After 4 hours I was ready to throw it out the window. Finally I gave up. What a waste of money this has been"
1,disappointed,"Unhappy with gate, which was presented as new. Arrived bent. I am trying to use, but cannot seem to straighten, thus it does not fit snuggly in the door way."
2,NOT for kids AND pets....,"i was super disappointed because i thought this was the same gate that they have for babies, but with a pet door. it is NOT! it doesn't secure to the wall enough for a baby. i guess it would be okay if it wasn't for use at the top of the steps or other major hazards. i REALLY wish that was listed clearly on here or i wouldn't have bought this gate. it said this on the instruction manual though!"
1,Description misleading,"I am very disappointed with the description of this gate. When I searched ""Baby Gate with Cat opening"" this gate came up. After reading the entire description it sounded like what I was looking for.... until I got it.... this gate is NOT to be used as a baby gate! It does not state that ANYWHERE in the description and the best part.... I couldn't even return the gate... so I just wasted 45 bucks on something I can't even use... this gate is to gate off dogs but still allowing a cat to roam... very disappointed!"
2,Weak pressure mounts and a high step-over,"A few reasons we decided to return this gate:- The pressure screws also control how much clearance the gate latch has. If the screws are tightened enough to securely hold the gate in place, the door cannot be opened. The gate can be mounted so the door opens freely, but then the top of the gate can be easily pushed over by our labrador (or our 9 month old).- There are included screw-mount cups to make the gate mount firmly. These work, but require a permanent mount position (and holes in the wall).- The metal brace at the bottom of the gate is about an inch-and-a-half high, if you place the gate at the top of a flight of steps, it's surprisingly clumsy to step over.All-in-all an clumsy, inelegant design."
1,Not sturdy enough,Installed this gate using the 6-inch extension in my 38-inch wide stairway. By the time you have the gate tightened in enough that you'd feel comfortable having a baby trying to climb it it has been compressed too tightly to open the gate! Loosen the screws enough to get the gate open and it wobbles when you put stress on it. I love the pet door idea but I'm going to have to return the gate because it just doesn't feel safe enough to keep my baby contained.
1,NOT FOR CHILDREN,"We have 2 cats and a 7 month old who is on the verge of crawling. The ""NOT for children"" label on the gate made me do a little more research. Over 100 children have died in the US from crawling through pet doors and drowning, wandering out into the street, etc. A 3 year old who is under 40 pounds could easily crawl through the door in this gate, and get into trouble. Well constructed and sturdy, but please don't use it for your child."
3,Love/Hate relationship,"We got this gate for the bottom of wide stairs to keep the puppy secured. It was easy to install and we loved the cat door. However, he has figured out how to knock it out of place by jumping on it (the non-hyper, non-jumping dog has NOT had an issue with this). A solution would be to tighten in it better... but the problem with the gate is that you can tighten the bottom really tight but if you do that to the top, you can use the walk through part as the latch part catches the nearest bar. I see this as a design flaw, especially something marketed as having a pet door, and also that it could cause a climbing toddler to pull it down on themselves. In addition, I think the latch is hard to open (great for keeping toddlers from figuring it out though!) and you must remember to push it down to lock it."
3,"Well made product, excellent price","Just bought and installed this product (bought mine at Wal-Mart for the same price as amazon). Quality product, much superior to the flimsy pet gates and baby gates you usually see. Had to tie open the cat door...the manufacture should fix that but it certainly wasn't a big deal. If you have an athletic dog and the gate is on carpeted floor, better look at the taller version. My border collie could easily jump this gate except she won't even try on slippery hardwood floors. Great product.10/02/2012 update. Gates are not wearing well. The tension seems to be relaxing and the gates no longer fit tightly. Believe it or not, a 60-pound german shepherd can fit through the cat door. Not nearly as happy as I was previously."
5,Greatest thing to happen to this house!,"I am incredibly happy with this gate!! We had a child gate to corral our dogs before that we had to step over all the time in a high traffic area. Having fell over this gate a couple of times, I was eager to try something different. I was super happy with the price and it was installed within 20 minutes after its delivery. Such a happy customer!!"
5,Works great!,Love the cat door. This is a very satisfactory solution and the quality is good too. Shipped REALLY fast!! Thanks!
3,Nice gate to keep the dogs out.,Nice gate to keep the dogs out. Great that it includes the extra extension. I am giving it 3 stars because it can be pushed down by my extra large Newfoundland dog. The weakest part of the gate is its extension screws that will flex when it is adjusted outward.
4,Extra Tall Gate,"Extra-Wide Walk-Thru Gate - White (30"") I have this gate and it functions really well. It is difficult to put together in that you think it is broken because it doesn't seem to come together at the top....BUT it does when you continue to crank it down. I have another brand of shorter gate that is the same system. I did find it in black and my only negative comment is that I would prefer the door walk through be a bit wider. It does stay put."
2,Warning: Do NOT use with Children,"It very clearly says this warning on the gate itself. To my great disappointment, though, this information is not part of the product description.So, buyer be warned that this product is not intended to be used as a baby gate; it's only to be used to keep large pets out while allowing smaller pets through."
4,"Serves it's purpose, but...","The gate works as intended. It generally keeps our dogs out of the room our cats enjoy - only catch is our 42 lb dog can easily fit through the small pet door (nothing a little training couldn't solve). One thing to be concerned about is on the extensions. There is a 90 degree bend in the outside bar of the extension; this creates a small gap near the top. One day the small pet door was closed so one of our cats attempted to jump over the gate. He got his foot caught in that gap.....foot stayed, but the rest his body continued over the gate resulting in a broken foot. This was a bit of a fluke, but it can happen."
3,Not bad...not perfect by any means,"Well the dog can fit through the cat door. We have a 28 pound german shorthair pointer and she went right through the door. Skinny thing with long legs...We had to MacGyver the door so she can't fit through. Also - the thing to open & close the ""people"" gate isn't the sturdiest and has already had a piece chip off and doesn't open the best. Wow - this sounds like a terrible review! It's functional and much easier to install than a traditional cat door. It took 10 minutes from in-the-box to in-the-door."
1,Dog gate no good carlson0930pw,My dog walks out between the bars.The gate is useless to us. It should not be sold to anyone who has a 7 lb dog
1,Dangerous design,"When I set isntalled this product, there were metal prongs that stuck out from the bottom and are highly dangerous. I bought this gate because there are 2 dogs, a cat, and a baby that is starting to walk in my household. I was excited when I found this gate because it was multipurpose, but as it turns out it is very dangerous. I am returning it."
3,Extra-Wide is actually teeny tiny!,"I should start by saying that the gate does what I intended it to do. It keeps my lab, a 5 month old chocolate that is huge (55 lbs) and still growing, out of the room where the cat box is located. She has managed to squeeze through the small door a few times, but for the most part it works great.However, I am very disappointed in the Extra-Wide Walk-Thru part of this gate. I am a plus size woman, and when I read the Extra-Wide part I believed that it would allow me to walk thru - not so at all. I am able to get thru the opening, but it is a tight fit, if I had not recently lost 60lbs and were not still working on my weight, I would not be able to get thru at all and would have returned the gate immediately. If you intend for this to be a semi-permanent installation, consider the size of the walk-thru part before ordering."
2,NOT A BABY GATE,This gate will sahow up in a baby gate search but the instructions that come with the gate clearly state that it is NOT TO BE USED WITH CHILDREN!
5,Does the job great!,"We ordered this item to keep our black lab out of the laundry room where we keep the food and litterbox for our two cats. It has worked perfectly. We didn't need the extensions but are happy to have them if we should ever need them. The price couldn't be beat. Saw the same item at Petco for around $79.00. It was simple and easy to install. We installed it so the door opens inward as we enter the room. We found this to be easier when entering the room with the laundry. We don't use the lock on the gate so it is easy to open and close the door by just lifting the handle. It looks great and it has done better than expected. Couldn't be happier (well, our dog could!)"
4,Nice Gate for price,"We bought ours for use as a baby gate and pet gate. Only issue is that you really have to know the exact measurements of the space you are putting it in because without using the extensions it can be too small and with the extensions it ends up way too big. We had to modify ours to fit, but overall it's a nice gate for the price we paid."
2,disapointed,I had been told by an employee at Petsmart that this gate was the best. I was surprised about workmanship looked good. but it is kind of flimsy. My dog (shih tzu) can get through between the bars. Does not say it is not for small dogs. So now I have to put things in front of it to keep her in. It does not stay secure to the wall either.
4,Cat loves it!,"I got this after my cat refused to jump over the plastic version in order to get into the room with her litter box. We really needed a gate to keep the new dog out but let the kitty cat in. Works even better than expected. The gate is high quality materials and production and costs less than the plastic version from PetSmart.The added bonus is that my cat loves her ""special"" door - she goes in and out, rubbing her face on the sides, all day long. She likes that it's just her size and dogs can't follow. With that and the new toys I put in the room, she's been using her litter box consistently."
5,Great Gate,"This gate is very nicely made, very sturdy and the walk thru gate is wider than I've seen on most other gates. It's also simple to open and close. We leave the little door open for the cat and the dogs can't get through, fyi they're about 50-60 lb. dogs. I liked this gate so much that I purchased another for the hallway."
5,Best gate,"This is the best gate I've ever bought. The gate is used to block off a room for my cat, so the dog won't bother her as much. Before, we had a pressure baby gate that was ridiculous to climb over. Would never buy another gate after this one. The dog used to jump up and put his feet on the baby gate we had before, making it fall over sometimes. Now, it's just high enough that he doesn't bother it. He tries to stick his head through the little door at the bottom. But, that's no problem.If something ever happened to this gate now, I'd definitely reorder a new one. Best decision I've ever made.I'd highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to make a ""safe"" room for their cat!"
5,Awesome deal!,Best deal for such a great pet door. My 80lb dog ran face first into it and it barely budged.
4,"Good, but not for toy sized dogs",This is a good quality gate. I want to love it but unfortunately I have a Toy sized dog ( less than 6 pounds). My dog is able to squeeze in between the guards and escape. I will still recommend for anyone with larger dog breeds given how sturdy and eye appealing the gate is.
3,"Decent, but not the best","Not very difficult to install but not the most sturdy gate out there. Our daughter can actually push through this gate at times. Very few times all be it, but sometimes."
5,Happy Cats,This is a great idea and sturdy gate. Now the cats can come and go and still get away from the pesky dog.
4,Pretty good product,First off if you are going to buy this you should know that the instructions say that this items is NOT for use with children but only for animals. That being said they are a very solid product and when mounted are very secure. I just upgraded the screws into studs and anchored into drywall. Quality control could be better. The little door on both I bought doesn't swing freely. It hits the frame when going back through. Just a little harder push gets it through. All in all I would purchase this again.
4,pet gate needs to be smaller,"Works great except my 55lb border collie fits through the pet door. She can easily follow the cats through their door, wish they made the cat door just a tad bit smaller."
4,Good product,"Purchased this gate to keep my lab off the new carpet when I'm not home. I read all the reviews and they were extremely useful. The size of your doorway if critical. This gate will work for a variety of sizes, but there are a few dimensions it will not fit. Product was easy to assemble ( I used both extensions) and easy to install. I do not intend to use the smaller pet gate, but the walk through gate is adequate. Product is somewhat flimsy, even when installed. If you have a large dog that likes to jump, I would have concerns that the gate would not stay in place. The gate did arrive with 1 bar bent, but gate is still functional and too much hassle to return and get another."
5,Works perfect! Easy install! Cats use the little door!,"I bought this to keep my dog out of the room we keep our kitty litter box. It does the job and the cats use the small door. Easy to install and open/close for access. Highly recommend this product, especially for the price! WOW!"
4,does exactly as advertised,"We bought this gate to keep the dog out of what's known as ""the cat's bathroom"", since it also has his litter box. It does that. Although it says right on it that it isn't for babyproofing, it also deters our daughter from trying to get in there, which was a pleasant bonus. It's thin enough that we can still close the bathroom door when necessary, and by keeping the small gate's pin out, it is always open for the cat.As far as installation goes, it took me at most five minutes to put up(we have a toddler, though, so I might be at an advantage here). We have an average sized doorway, so we didn't need the extensions.I wish we had one approved for child safety so we wouldn't have to keep the cat on the ground floor of our house all day."
4,A great gate for animal owners.,"I purchased this gate thinking my really young kittens wouldn't get over it so easily to get them use to the new house though of course being kittens this simple gate won't stop from going over. So of course this gate didn't really serve the purpose I had in mind for it. Though with that being said I still think this gate is a great gate for animal owners as it really is a sturdy gate that isn't easily going to be toppled over with a nudge or light push. If you own a dog and cat this will give the cat easy access to all rooms in the house while making sure the dog doesn't go into other areas or as well as keeping young babies/small children from accessing parts of the house as well.The door latch is really easy to use and with plenty of ""walk-Thru"" room to go through the gate and close behind you with an easy snap. This is a really good gate to have and HIGHLY recommend it for those that have a need for a gate in their house."
4,Extra-Wide Doorway Block - Smallish Gate,"Gate goes up quickly and easily.We haven't installed the wall mount rings - because we are loath to put any more holes than absolutely necessary in our home. As a result, I have to adjust the gate every few days or so. If using in an area with children - don't skip this step, the gate will move if leaned on, run into, etc.The walk through area is just enough for one adult to pass through unencumbered. If you are carrying anything, etc. - you will need to lift it over. This usually wouldn't be an issue, except that we have it at the top of the stairs. We're getting used to it.Once adjusted to the doorway, it opens/closes with relative ease.We generally don't click the release all the way down. The safety release is a bit less intuitive than the rest. However, if you have children, that feature would be a great thing to have!Overall, we like it. Wish the gate opening were a little wider though."
1,awful awful awful,"Horrendous gate. Not sturdy at all. I have a 30 LB GSD mix and he knocked it over on the first jump. Set up was terrible. took over an hour and not worth the money! I ended up having to buy a different one from petsmart.Also, the cat door does only open one way! however, cats can jump with ease so its not such a big deal, also u can just prop it open."
1,Extra wide pet walk thru gate,very cheap and flimsy! I would never buy this type of product ever again! It just falls apart! I didn't help or serve it's purpose...
2,Not compatible with molding,"I was extremely disappointed from the moment the package arrived. The box had been ripped, but the gate appeared to be fine. The gate does not work in our apartment, as there is molding along the floor. Therefore, the top will not align with the wall."
3,Great for big dogs,"This gate is a great concept, but I find the cat door too large. My 25 lb dog can still fit through easily; it's not even a tight fit. It works great for my collie mix, though (55 lbs). I also find the openings between the upright slats a little wide. My small cat can fit through even when the cat door is closed. All in all it's a great solution for the right sized pets."
4,Great price for a great product!!,This was super easy and quickly installed- we ordered it to keep our cats and dog seperated in the house. The cats are older and had trouble jumping over a previous gate- the small walk thru door for them worked out terrific!
5,Finally a gate that keeps the dog out and the cat food in!,"After years of stepping or tripping over awkward plastic or wood child gates placed in a doorway to keep the dog out of the cat food and litter box, with cats leaping over the gate to get in and out, I was relieved to finally find a gate that served all purposes. I can open the gate to walk in and out of my home office, the small pet door is left open for the cats to walk in and out of the room to reach their litter box and food areas, while it is tall enough and secure enough with the pressure mounted arms to keep the large dogs out! Great value, great solution."
4,Works as advertised.,I purchased this gate to separate my dog from my 16 month old child. It works well enough to keep her from opening the gate due to the locking mechanism. Once it is on the door frame it is relatively sturdy. I would recommend it for anyone who needs the separation but doesn't feel like climbing over a gate every time they want to get into the room they're blocking.
2,expected better,was dissapointed with the overall condition of the book. was marked on cover and inside first page by what looked like a nine year old. appreciated the speed book was delivered but man they could have told me the cover was in such bad shape
5,I only see 1 problem,Every few pages there is a smudge that occurs. More like an ink blotch that is usally less than 1cm x 1cm on any given page. Other than that the color prints are nice.
1,Piece of JUNK,"I have used this printer for 3,128 pages total! It is now rendered more expensive to fix than it is worth. Also, HP embedds microchips into the toner cartridges and they tell you how many prints you will print. After the chips cutt the toner off you may find anywhere from 10% - 40% toner left in the cartridges. I will NEVER BUY another HP Product."
1,Historian,"The book is an absolute disgust. Has NOTHING to do with the reality,misrepresents facts in every single chapter. Not worth reading, just a waste of time. Author should familiarize himself with the basic facts before writing on the subject. Very unprofessional and poorly written."
4,"Very, very complex subject","Well, I liked this book and I didn't like it. The scope of the book is simply tremendous and perhaps another 1,000 pages would cover 80% of history, society, politics that has breathed in the area for 4,000+ years. Yes, I would enjoy reading an unabridged book about the Black Sea area. The current book is just too abridged for me. I sure did learn many things I did not know and found the author's travels mildly amusing, but the lack of more detailed maps of the regions around the Black Sea were lacking. I had to go to my Turkey Travel Guide (Insight Guide@)to locate some places mentioned or the general area of the referent. I do take some issue with the authors use of Scythians-different groups of, as opposed to a progression from Scythian, Saka, Sarmatian, Sauromatiaion, Thracian, Ossetian, Alans, and so on. See Jeannine Davis-Kimball, Ph.D. and read her work. Would I buy this book again-You bet!"
3,An odd geography lesson.,"What's up with all this discussion on Poland? Reading ""Black Sea,"" one notices after a while that they're no longer reading about the Black Sea at all. Then you look in the index and see that more space is devoted to Poland than virtually any other single subject. Then you look in the author's cv and see that he's written extensively on Poland. If I'd wanted to read about Poland, I would have bought ""Poland."" (Otherwise, extraordinarily good.)"
3,Could have/should have been better,"Great topic. High potential. Poor execution. Ascherson's peripatetic narration, including first person asides, is hard to follow. The lack of a map of the Black Sea is a bewildering (and frustrating) omission. If you are a reader who enjoys placing himself in a story, you may find yourself drifting and disappointed."
2,unreadable to all but a PHD Student of Gothic Architecture,"I agree with the retired Professor who said it reads like a PHD dissertation. As a textbook for a bachelors level class it is useless. It assumes graduate level knowledge of very technical terms and does not offer translations for the many foreign language quotes. As a 4th year Art History major and prior holder of a BA in Anthropology, this is the worst textbook I've ever used."
4,Good travel log if you have never been there,Enjoyed this travel log. Good like a PBS show I enjoyed and hope to go visit Grand Canyon and Yellowstone in the future. Worth the money
3,"A cultural phenomenon, but wildly inconsistent","To be fair, it's got three of the best singles ever made, but it takes more than three great singles to make a masterpiece, and most of this is slick, MOR filler, not to mention painfully dated.The sound effects on ""P.Y.T."" alone are cringe-inducing. The McCartney duet gets points for tossing interracial love on top of the charts in 1982, but the song itself is very cloying. The title track's cheesy, but it did produce a ground-breaking video. Can't say I'm a fan of ""Human Nature,"" but plenty of people have a soft spot for 'yacht rock.'Jackson's got a ton of compilations, and as long as you pick one with ""Billie Jean,"" ""Beat It"" and ""Wanna Be Starting Something,"" you don't need 'Thriller.' His REAL masterpiece is 'Off The Wall' - track-for-track, a stone-cold classic."
5,A NECESSITY FOR ALL POP-LOVERS!,"If you like any Pop music from the 90s or the 80s, such as people like Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera, you have got to have this album! Its the best Pop Album that I know of, and perhaps the second best record that I have ever listened to, only the Beatles' WHITE ALBUM surpasses it. Beat It, The Girl Is Mine, Thriller and Billie Jean are the most catchy Pop songs I have heard EVER. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD!"
5,I love Thriller,"I've wanting to buy Michael Jackson's Thriller since last year in 2008. I've brought his ""Off The Wall, Bad, &Invincible"" cds as well. My favorite songs on the Thriller album are: of course Thriller, Beat It, Billie Jean, Human Nature, P.Y.T., Got To Be Startin Somethin, &Baby Be Mine. I've listened to all of those songs, which were so good, I wanted to almost record them all on one of my albums. I'm an all-around instrumental musician. But the Thriller album is nice."
1,Avoid Vinyl version.,I have the original LP and the sound is like night and day. The reissue is a sad representation of the original version.It looks like the CD version is what you need to get to appreciated the 2nd best selling album of all time.
2,"Great album, lackluster SACD","I'd wanted this SACD for awhile, so was thrilled to finally get the chance to order it. I was disappointed to find out it was only 2 channel as opposed to surround sound, but more disappointing was the average sound quality. I own the 20th anniversary remastered edition on CD and put it on to compare it to the SACD version. The remastered edition actually had cleaner sound.While the stereo mix on the SACD did seem enhanced, the sound had a somewhat muffled quality compared to the clarity I was used to from the remastered edition. But more than that, the disappointment of no surround mix is truly a deal breaker for me."
4,Remixes could have been better,"Really love this album. Remember buying it when it came out and listening to it over and over. Great to revisit but the remixes are really sort of lame. I thought they would be great re-imaginings of the songs and mostly they are just ""disco versions."" Great DVD too. I wonder if the 2001 version with the unreleased songs is still available. Anyone?"
5,A Man of No Equal,To everyone. A all new Michael Jackson Album coming out Next Spring (2000)I love you Michael.
3,Classic Album,"This is a great album, however I took 2 stars off because they didn't give us a choice with the Interviews. I don't like the idea of having interviews on my music cds.. and they should have put out 2 versions, for those of us who don't like that.The music gets 5 stars.. the remastering gets 5 stars... interviews.... NO!"
2,Bonus material a rip-off -- buyer beware!,"This remastered CD has great sound quality, but the liner notes brag that it includes bonus songs -- however, they are only EXCERPTS of those songs; there is even commentary from Quincy Jones OVER the start of the them! Who wants half a song? I feel ripped off and DON'T think I will be buying his other reissues. This is a horrible lapse in judgment on Jackson's part, but then, what's new? The best thing about the extra tracks is the Vincent Price rap session, which is truly fascinating."
3,Horrible Packaging,The album was in good shape and plays flawlessly. My only complaint is that this version comes in a clear sleeve and not an actual album cover to protect the record. The description doesn't clearing tell you that either. Had I known I would have paid the extra 5 bucks at the time for the version that has a cover.
3,Must Have Keepsake,"This is a must have for any Micheal fan. Your collection is not complete without this one. Even if you have all his greatest hits cd's, you must include this."
3,Michael Focuses on Developing His Entertainer Side,"After musical achievement and commercial success of Off the Wall, Michael Jackson seems to start focusing on developing his entertainer side. The first track from his second solo album Thriller, ""Wanna be Startin' Somethin',"" is a polished presentation of his genuine talent in vocal/percussion arrangement with a Latin taste, developed from Off the Wall. The rest of the album is more entertaining, consisting of more narrative songs (i.e., ""The Girl is Mine,"" ""Thriller,"" and ""Billie Jean""), whose Quincy-produced tracks are, sometimes decorated with sound effects, more synthesized. Guest appearances of Paul McCartney and Eddie Van Halen even make the album more appealing to a wide range of popular music fans. Along with these factors combined, the sequence of mega-hits just sounds overwhelmingly nostalgic to the audience who has experienced the 80s."
5,Treasure!,"""For All Time"" is my new treasure. Beautiful ballad, proving that MJ still has it.All the original tracks are beautifully remastered, reminding us why Michael Jackson is the King of Pop, Rock, and Soul.""P.Y.T. 2008"" is my favorite remix from Thriller 25. It's fresh and 'dance-able', just like we expect from Michael Jackson. I absolutely love it."
5,MJ 25th anniversary,"What's not to love. This is one of the best CD's I own. Love it!!The DVD is great, but wish Billie Jean was on it, too."
1,Are People Still Listening To This???,"This was the most overrated album of the 1980s. I couldn't believe the praise it got then, and I can't believe that anyone would still want to listen to this disco-influenced tripe."
1,The King of Hype,Proof positive that hype will take you far. How else can one explain the enduring success of this set of unremarkable songs?
1,King of Hype,"This album was a dive in 1982 when it was released, in 1983 when it was hyped in overexposure, and in 1984 when the dopey, overblown video for the title song was everywhere.It was a dive then and it is a dive still today. The fact that people still fall for it just goes to show no one goes broke underestimating the taste of the American public."
4,Thriller is good but not the best.,Thriller is a good album but in my opinion it certainly is not the best for everybody.Here is how I rate the songs.1.Wanna Be Startin Somethin-An upbeat song.A good way to start the beggining.10/102.Baby Be Mine-A mid tempo love song.I like it.9/103.The girl is mine-a vocal duet with PAul McCartney and MichaelJackson. A slow song.Sounds OK to me.8/104.Thriller-The title song of the album.A fast mooving spooky song.I hate it.5/105.Beat It-A very fast song with guitar music in between the song.Too fast to fit the album. I dislike this song.4/106.6.Billy Gene-Known as the KIng of Pop's biggest hit.I also love this song.It is a fast moving song.10/107.Human Nature-A soft slow moving song.Very beautiful sounding0 to my ear.10/108.PYT-A fast song for me this is the worst song on the album.I seriously hate it.1/109.The Lady in My Life-A slow love song. Very beautiful background vocals.!0/10
5,greatest rap album of all time,"I know a lot of people say dr dre's album the chronic is the greatest rap album of all time but, i'm hear to set the record straight. Thriller is the best rap album of all time. It paved the way for other rappers like NWA,Snoop Dogg, and 2Live Crew.If it weren't for the greatest rapper of all time Michael Jackson rap wouldn't be where it is today.So go buy this album"
5,it never goes away,"I can listen to beat it and billie jean and still remain excited to hear the sound of music penetrating through my mind, body and ears. Thriller will continue to thrill forever!"
4,Good but not perfect...,"Yes, this album's got some awsome music on it, like ""Thriller"", ""Beat It"", ""Billie Jean"" and ""P.Y.T"". But this is NOT the Michael Jackson I really like. So which 'Michael Jackson' do I like? Bad! That was one great album, far better than Thriller. But if you get sick of all that pop, there's the more R&B-ish Thriller...History Part II is pretty good, but Blood On The Dancefloor was horrid! Michael Jackson and a remix album? Oh, what the heck, get the album on MP3, that's all I can say......remember BAD!"
5,i liked thriller it was the one motown hit. i love it.,i liked thriller it was the one motown hit i love .
1,WARNING,"THIS CD WILL NOT PLAY ON ANY STANDARD CD PLAYER! My husband ordered this, not knowing that a SACD will NOT play on a regular CD player, and so we had to eat the restocking fee. Just be aware of this so you don't think this is a regular CD."
1,"Marketing, pure and simple","All hype, and nothing else, ""Thriller"" represents a complete triumph of marketing over substance. That this tripe could sell 40 million just goes to show what promotion will do. If you want to be lemming #40,000,001 go ahead and get this, but if you want music with any kind of depth or integrity, you need to move on."
1,Spend your money on something worthwile!,"Once was the time when Michael Jackson WAS the King of Pop, but that time is long gone. Now, ""Thriller"" stands alongside most of the 80's wasted musical moo. Asinine and vapid are the nicest words I can use. Music is far too powerful a medium to be so wasted. As for this album selling so many copies, so what!? True art cannot be measured by such trivialites."
5,Nothing beats All-American perfection!,Just goes to prove:Great artist & their music still have a direct connection to 'the masses' that today's tabloid media could only wish for!
3,not good enough to buy,"I have worked with Michael Jacksons producers for a few years now, last year I tried to get a CD released called ""Michael Jacksons greatest Hits Live!"" they hated the idea of a live CD or greatest hits so I found a way to release it without there permission, they found out and they fired me, I was so mad, when i see this CD in stores I think of how much Michael Jackson SUCKS!!!!!"
1,a sad pitiful album from a sick man,"wow this album sucks, i havent even heard but since its by that guy it sucks hello people he molested kidswhy would you pay for a cd by him unless you were sick yourselfplease do burn this cd if you own it and than go out and buy great albums like, dark side of the moon, sgt. peppers lonely hearts club band, and are you experiencedHORRIBLE ALBUMI HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE THIS ALBUMall of his cds should be banned from the public since there so badmichael jackson sucks hes a sicko"
5,KING ALBUM FROM KING OF THE POP!!!,"this album is remember me ok the golden age for pop music , and it has so many awesome remix of MJJ songs.."
5,THE BEST!,I WAS 13 Y.O WHEN THE ORIGINAL THRILLER WAS REALESED. I GREW UP WITH MJ AND 25 YEARS LATER IT'S STILL THE BEST RECORD OF ALL TIMES!!!!!!!!NOW EVEN BETTER!!!!!!!!!!
5,Shipping was fast,The cd was in perfect condition. I did have some trouble ripping the cd to iTunes but thy is probably a software problem.
3,Thriller,The album was good but not as good as I thought it would be. Not a lot of Michaels songs that I remember. The transaction was very easy to do and the product was received in a quick time and in good condition.
4,Decent,"Off The 9 Tracks I'd Have To Say The Bad Ones Are The Girl Is Mine, PYT, And The Lady In My Life. Other Than That, This Album Is Great. Especially Beat It.Chart PeaksThriller (Album) #1 US & UKThe Girl Is Mine #2 US #7 UKBillie Jean #1 UK & USBeat It #1 US #3 UKWanna Be Startin' Somethin' #5 US #7 UKHuman Nature #7 USThriller #4 US"
2,Additional CD content terribly unnecessary,"Short review: The original album content is great. Michael Jackson was such an immensely talented artist.But the additional content is terrible. I can't imagine any other credible artist of Jackson's stature adding additional content such as this (if at all). Imagine the Beatles including 6 extra crappy rap remixes of ""Sgt. Pepper"" on the original album. Or a re-release of Led Zeppelin IV including 5 extra cheese-ball tracks of beat box re-treads of ""Stairway to Heaven"" of ""When the Levee Breaks"".Fail."
5,This is a perfect album and a classic,"This is a classic album from Mike. I love every track especially ""Wanna Be Startin Somethin"", ""The Lady In My Life"" and ""Billie Jean"". The romantic ""Human Nature"" stands out for me too. This is a perfect album from beginning to end, and it brings back a lot of memories for me. I love the new remixes on this disc. I love the ""Beat It"" remix by Fergie. It sounds tough and gritty. I also love ""The Girl is Mine"" remix too. This is Michael Jackson at his best."
3,"Recent tabloid noise about ""Jacko"" notwithstanding...","...I've got a bone to pick with this man and his promoters. Ever since he sang ""One Bad Apple"" with his older brothers as a little boy, the industry has been Jackson-ed to death like the British never were in New Orleans back in 1812. This older brother. That kid sister. Sibling after sibling. I dread the day the next generation clobbers us! At least the Clooney family only hit us with two--only one each generation, and those each in different branches of entertainment."
3,Not *that* great,"Well-produced by Quincy Jones, soulfully sung, and with a number of hit songs, this album rose to become the biggest seller of all time, but mostly on the basis of hype and video images, at a time when idiots were watching ""Alf"", electing Reagan, and twiddling Rubix cubes. It seems dated now, and it's hard for any album to deserve all the sales this one got. Young listeners today who weren't around when it came out want nothing to do with it, as much of it has not endured. I actually prefer ""Off the Wall,"" which at least is funky."
5,"The king of pop ruled, rules and shall ALWAYS rule!","Michael jackson is a unique artist who on all of his albums diplays pure perfection and undisputed musical talent. ""Thriller"" changed and influenced the entire music scene. Basically all music that we hear today, is based on this groundbreaking record. The groundbreaking didn't stop after ""Thriller"". Rocking, jamming, and beautifuly composed songs can be heard on ""BAD' ""DAngerous"" and the ""HIStory"" album. Take your time and listen to the music without being bias. In the end, all that counts is the music and the music only! Music with a message is even better, so listen to the words. Don't forget ""off the wall""."
1,"Amazon is STUPID, and this seller is unscrupulous.","I complained to Amazon after paying full price for an an item from this dealer and the dealer renegging on the contract. Yet Amazon wants a review.OK--here it is--AMAZON is stupid, doesn't realize that the buyer renegged on the contract, is not aware I filed a complaint and wants a review!! Amazon is so seller oriented that the buyer is without redress.The buyer has engaged in this conduct before. They list something, find out it is worth more than they ask, then say--item is not available--an error in inventory.Amazaon did not research my complaint."
2,Wow,The music was great but there was no DVD in this set. Very disappointed in the seller. Misrepresentation all the way.
5,Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller,Very satisfied. Got my order in a timely manner and it was just what I expected.
5,Make that 60 million...,"The editorial review for this classic album is very out of date. Thriller has now sold 60 million copies worldwide. Buy it, listen to it and you'll know why. This is the greatest album ever made hands down. Music critics don't want to admit it, after fawning over the Beatles for so many years. But this album blows them away. CLASSIC!!!"
5,Agreed this is an alltime CLASSIC!!!,"Michael may not be the King Of Pop NOW. But that is even debateable. Because who will ever surpass this incredible record? Its sold nearly 60 million won 8 grammy's, 7 American music awards, spawned 7 top ten hits & god knows how many platinum awards. Yes this is thee greatest phenomenon in the history of the music business. And it still sounds GREAT. I love Wanna Be Starting Something & Human Nature the best.If you don't already own this alltime classic, give it a try. There is a very good reason why it is still the best selling album of alltime after 20 years."
5,Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary of Thriller,"The CD is excellent and bought back many memories. The video was a special treat for the grandchildren. They had never seen ""Thriller"" now they will never forget it either, it was excellent."
5,Great product,"It came quick and it was great. I don't like Michael Jackson's music, but it was great to give this gift to somebody that would appreciate it."
3,RIPPED OFF...,THIS IS A STEREO ONLY SACD. THERE IS NO MULTICHANNEL TRACK AND IT SOUNDS VERY CLEAN - BUT I WAS EXPECTING A MULTICHANNEL SURROUND TRACK IN HI-RES. AMAZON WILL NOT LET ME RETURN IT -ALTHOUGH IT WAS IN MY SACD PLAYER FOR NO MORE THAN 60 SECONDS. BEEEEE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING ONLINE... ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN INCREDIBLE ALBUM - I ALREADY HAVE IT IN BASIC CD FORM AND IT PLAYS IN DTS NEO:6 / ALL CH ETC. ACTUALLY IT SOUNDS BETTER IN THE BASIC CD FORMAT CONSIDERING THAT YOU CAN CREATE A MULICHANNEL ENVIRONMENT.
1,Don't believe the hype!,"All hype, and nothing else, ""Thriller"" represents a complete triumph of marketing over substance. That this tripe could sell 40 million just goes to show what promotion will do. If you want to be lemming #40,000,001 go ahead and get this, but if you want music with any kind of depth or integrity, you need to move on."
2,A Few Thoughts,"Someone once told me this is the biggest selling album ever.The sequencing is pretty screwy. The song ""Thriller"" should have ended side 2.I believe Billie Jean's side of the story.Why didn't they include ""Stranger in Moscow""?"
1,Has aged poorly,"At the time I thought this was a great sound, but looking back on it now it is clear how poor an album this really is. Jackson has no real talent other than sounding like whatever happens to be popular at the time."
3,Pop is really not my favorite,"This is the number one selling album of all time, I believe. I'm not into pop, but I bought it 'cause my daughter wanted it..."
2,OVERRATED,"I always thought MJ was a tab bit on the OVERRATED side. This may be the most successful Album of all time for whatever reason be it hype or what have you but that by no means makes it the Best Album of all time. I have yet to touch a ""perfect"" album but this here is far from it. The best songs to me are Billie Jean, Thriller & Beat It in that order but the rest is pretty much rubbish, nothing worthy of the hype. You'd probably be surprised by some of the Albums id put above this one. lol, Im finding more & more that MJ was a very REPETITIVE artist. 5.5/10"
1,Not Received,"I would love to give a review for this product, but I can't because I never received it from the seller. I'm not sure whether or not it was shipped, or if it got lost in transit, but I never received it."
1,It's not worth all the fuss,"This is the most overrated album ever. Virtually every track sounds the same and all MJ fans are so one-eyed that they will not hear a word against this piece of nonsense. When Thriller was released in the U.K it entered the album charts at number 11 and did not move many people but as soon as a daft video and a load of good publicity stories about sleeping in oxygen chambers, etc everyone went out like a load of sheep and bought this tripe. Wake up people as there are so many more albums out there to buy other than this."
3,Thriller Import Blu-Spec CD,"Having compared this Blu-Spec CD with the regular red book CD recording of the same material using a highend reference listening music system, there is a noticeable improvement with the Blu-Spec version which overall sounds better to my ears. The 1999 SACD was widely reported as not very good sounding. If I recall correctly (as I don't have the SACD on hand), it was not an DSD SACD and would most likely not have the sonic detail of DSD SACDs."
5,!! PURE F A C T !!,"IF ELVIS PRESLEY IS THE KING................. MICHAEL JACKSON IS GOD !! !! !!I usually do reviews but in very rare cases like this, I don't need to. FIVE STARS!! and So,All the negative talk about his court cases, his appearance, and other B S you want to throw this only shows your jealousy & stupidity. You didn't mind Elvis being withh that underage tramp so, give it up. Elvis touched (mostly) ONE race. Michael touched them ALL. Elvis copied Black music & moves. Michael RE-CREATED it & them!! Even other entertainers in all genres of music, are jealous of this man, and with good reason. Before anyone did anything, Elvis stole everything. Michael simply took it back and wiped the Presley stank off of it."
1,"The Item was never recieved, zero stars but it makes you put something",I bought this product for a friend in Pakistan. I was appalled at how long the shipping was projected to take (more than a month) but my friend reports that he never recieved the cd. If shipping to Pakistan is such a risky propostion I think customers might be told that Amazon cannot assure us that a prodect will arrive.
5,Michael Jackson CAN make great music!,"Don't believe me? I dare you to buy this record. All though most people see Michael as a freak to make fun of, that doesn't make Thriller any less of a giant. The biggest selling album of all time, he must have done something right!!! And one of only three albums to generate 7 top 10 singles (The other two being Bruce Springsten's Born in the USA and Janet Jackson's Rhythm Nation.)Thriller is an energetic record, producing several everlasting hits including Beat It, Thriller, and Billie Jean. It has something for everyone, rock, pop, and funk. Dancey tunes and slow ballads, its all there!Thriller ultimately proves that Michael IS and ALWAYS will be the King of Pop. He leaves shallow boy bands and pop divas of the 90's in the dust.Two words, buy it."
2,Wasted Chance!!!!,"The 2 Stars are not for the album,(I Love Thriller), they're for the LAME bonus disc. I just see this release as a huge wasted chance to finally release the rest of the great unreleased tracks from the Thriller sessions. What happened to songs like ""Hot Street"", ""Trouble"" and ""NightLine"". Those songs are excellent and are a worthy addition to a Thriller 25th year collection. I couldn't care less about a bunch of remixes. I never listen to them. The Black Eyed Peas don't belong on a release of Thriller. Michael could've and should've done much better."
2,Avoid remastered CD's,"Let me say that I love the Thriller album, even if it seems a tad dated now. If you have the original CD of Thriller, hang onto it. It has better sound and more dynamic range than the 2001 or 2008 remastered CD's. Don't be fooled thinking remastered is better. All they do is turn everything up so it sounds louder, which in effect distorts and you lose the important dynamic range. Don't believe me? Have another listen to your remastered CD and notice how blaringly loud it is, and how much detail is lost. Also have a look at this interesting YOUTUBE discussion on Thriller remastered. You'll never buy another remastered CD again:[...]"
5,Michael Jackson 25th Anniversary Thriller,I bought & received this cd the day before Michael Jackson died. How ironic! It is a great cd and dvd. Any fan should have one.
2,Thriller SACD,"I was very unimpressed by the SACD version of this album .First be aware it is only stereo not multi-channel .I found that compared to other SACD,s which i have listened to this album seems very bright.Michaels voice was not well defined.Overal impression was that normal CD better ballanced"
3,A Classic Album needs DTS treatment,"This is a classic album reissued for money with a couple of ""remixes"".Sony/CBS should have remastered and issued in DTS 96/24 5.1 surround format.Just imagine the 9 songs including Thriller,Beat it,Billie Jean,Human Nature comming from all round the room and the effects.Now that would be an album worth re-buying just for DTS surround and a must for any collection."
1,not multi-channel audio,"This is not a review of the music itself, but just a comment on the SACD version of the album. I had this album on analog cassette tape way back when, and always wanted a CD version. When I saw that there was now an SACD encoded version, I immediated added it to my cart, thinking that it may have been re-mixed as multi-channel audio (like Dark Side of the Moon and Brothers in Arms had been). I guess I should have done my homework, since it wasn't. This album is in SACD format, but only as 2-channel stereo. I probably shouldn't have paid extra money to get this."
5,Quintessential pop star,His timing was phenomenal any was clearly talented beyond many in the industry from day 1 born to be an entertainer and performed his role perfectly.
5,"It's Thriller, man..",Of course it gets 5 stars. One of the most influential albums of the last 50 years. The soundtrack of my middle/high school years.
3,"Great album, pressing problems, bad sleeve","I ordered ""Thriller"" on vinyl direct from Amazon. The disc is a pretty wobbly press that skipped on ""Billie Jean"" right out of the sleeve. The sleeve it came in was broken, and doesn't hold the disc properly.I'm disappointed in Amazon's ability to deliver a vinyl disc. I'll give them another chance though."
2,"Love the album, can't get it transferred to my iPod","This album was an incredible buy and I was anticipating listening to it on my iPod; however, after spending an entire afternoon trying to transfer it to my iPod, had to give up. A waste, even at a bargain price!"
5,What can I say.......it's MJ at his best!,One of my favorite CD's of all tim. This collection brings back so many great memories and hearing these hits back to back is nothing short of amazing.
5,MIchael Jackson! Love the album! Rest in peace!,"I love this album! I have this album a long time ago, but it was thrown away by my dad by accident! Then i purchase it again a long time ago! Then i order it from you guys, well the person who sold it on Amazon then i purchase it from that person again for a best friend of mind. She is going to love this album! This is the best record that Michael Jackson ever made from back in the day! I probably have two albums of Michael Jackson's Thriller album! And not only that, it was in total mint condition like the seller said! I wanna thank the seller and thank amazon for this record, because I tried so hard to find this record in every old record store! Thanks again! And rest in peace Michael Jackson and a shot out to the whole Jackson family to!De'Vear SmallAKA Dee SmallsRepresenting Decatur, GA"
2,Strange...,"I think even Michael Jackson doesn't understand how this average recording turned out to be the best seeling record ever. It's an average albun, not bad at all, but nothing special. There are three or four great songs, the rest is plain boring."
3,"Great album, cheap packaging","This album is great, the record sounds fine, but it comes in cheap wrapping. There is no paper sleeve for it, and the album jacket is just a thin plastic: there is no true album jacket"
3,Video Disappointment,Very disappointed to discover that the music videos cannot be downloaded into iTunes so that I can also watch them on my iPod. -- Or at least not with standard download procedures.
3,Not that great,I was disappointed in this album. Some songs are good but it was a waste of money. It would be better just to download the single songs that you like from this album.
5,MICHEAL JACKSON 25TH ANNIVERSARY THRILLER,"MISS YOU MIKE IT WAS NOT YOUR TIME. PEOPLE GET OFF THE DRUGS THEY WILL KILL YOU.FALL ON YOUR KNEES LIFT YOU HANDS AND VOICE TO JESUS, HE IS WAITING TO HEAL YOU.OF COURSE THE CD IS GREAT, THE MAN HAD A GOD GIVEN GIFT. GONE TOO SOON."
2,25 Anniv Thriller Vinyl,Horrible mastering for vinyl. Did they not put limiters on the sound editing when recording? This album sounds great on cd format but when played in a vinyl record Michael's vocals and guest artists like WillIam go static when they hit high notes. Sounds terrible.
2,ok but not great,I don't like all the tracks with talking at the beginning-I just wanted the great music to work out to!
4,Great Memories,I have the album and wanted to download the music to my MP3 player. Best thing. Michael Jackson was at his best.
5,Soundtrack of my teen years,"When 'Thriller' was first released December 1982 I was 13 years old. It was a continuation of the wonderful magic of solo Michael that I could enjoy and remember from 'Off The Wall'. This album is excellent in that it is the greatest pop album of all time and is timeless in the classics here. From 'Billie Jean', 'Beat It' to 'She's Out of My Life' Michael was on a roll. This album got me through my highschool years since his next release 'Bad' didn't come out til 2 months after I finished highschool in 1987. It's the album that everybody you know owns and I have bought it several times over the years when various copies got worn out by my constant playing of it. Truly this was the album that earned Michael being KING OF POP!"
3,Alright Cut but Love the Instrumental in the Video,I was Never that crazy about this Song but I dug the Instrumental Break when Michael was doing His steps in the Video.
4,"5* for Thriller, 0* for the remixes","This album should really get two ratings, one for the actual MJ album, and the other for the remixes.Nothing needs to be said about Thriller. It's Thriller, and it's fantastic. Enough said.The remixes however... are some of the worst garbage released on a major record label... ever. Fergie attempting to sing Beat It is absolutely painful. The Kanye version of Billie Jean is nothing but the original song slowed down with a sloppy beat overdubbed. I'm not even going to speak of the Akon track. Seriously, these ""bonus"" tracks are criminally bad. I can only assume that their presense on the album is a mistake, and they should be listened to only for comedic value."
2,"Ok album, but you get tired of it.","This album defined a decade, but I find that 17 years later I don't really care if I hear it anymore or not. There are many 80s artists whose work is more enduring. It entertained me in the early 80s, but it's past its prime."
5,First l.p. to sell 100 million copies.,"First l.p. to sell 100 million copies according to The Guiness Book Of World Records. Current sales are at 110 million copies worldwide according to The World Music Awards in 2006. Also ""HIStory: Past, Present, And Future - BOOK I"" has sold 20 million copies worldwide which makes it the best selling multi-disc set of all time (with a total of 40 million discs sold as the set is sold at full price and each disc are 75 minutes long). ""Blood On The Dance Floor - HIStory In The Mix"" is also the world's best selling remix l.p."
5,Thriller!,Receiving this record was a thriller. It is a double-sided picture disc and it sounds great. The songs included are some of his best. I definitely recommend this LP.
5,Amazing Shape,"Previously bought this record on Amazon because I could not find it anywhere in stores. I'll admit I was skeptical about buying it online without seeing it first, but I figured it was only 20$ so I figured what the hay. I must say I am beyond pleased with my purchase.It came long before the estimated delivery date. The record itself was in EXCELLENT condition. No scratches, scrapes or scuffs. It came with original lyric sheet. Sleeve was in EXCELLENT condition (there were maybe 2 folds on the whole surface). For something to be 30 years old this album was well kept.Highly recommend this album to anyone who is a Michael fan, a lover of vinyl, or music enthusiast."
2,This could've been better....,"The fans wanted more UNRELEASED songs from the original sessions. Not these remixes from these flash in the pan performers.Still, this is Thriller, so it will be regardless, but the remixes slightly cheapens it's legacy"
4,thriller,"I ordered this for my son, who at age 8 was a Michael Jackson fan big time. Now at 34 has a keep sake of his youth."
5,MICHAEL JACKSON THRILLER 25TH,THE PRODUCT WAS WHAT I ORDERED BUT I WAS CHARGED WAY TOO MUCH FOR IT AND WHEN I WROTE COMPLAINING THAT I DID I WAS TOLD WE DONT HAVE A PRICE GUARANTEE THIS PRODUCT IS SELLING AT FYE FOR $19.95 AND I PAYED $29.95 I WAS NOT HAPPY ABOUT THE ANSWER I GOT FROM AMAZON AND WOULD NOT BUY ANOUTHER CD AGAIN THANK YOU GIACOMO TESORIERO
2,Greatest Album of All Time? THINK AGAIN!,"I don't remember if my family ever OWNED this album, all I know is that it is said to be the greatest album of all time. Well, that was the case, and whatever it was about this album that drove the whole world into a frenzy for it, that may still be the case for some people. For me, it isn't. And Mr. Jackson, with his screechy woman-like voice, doesn't know how to sing, good as he used to be. His own sister, Janet, has the voice of an angel compared to his. I suggest to future reviewers of this otherwise ""impressive"" album listen to another landmark album out there, like Andrea Bocelli's ""Romanza,"" and then compare: Is M.J. STILL the so-called ""King of Pop""?"
1,Overrated Beyond Words,"Marketing will work wonders. Just ask most anybody who was around in 1983 and 1984 and you'll know how massive this album was. The question is why? Lots of hype, but little in the way of merit. There is no reason to fall for this junk all over again and contrary to the belief of some this is NOT the best selling album of all time. That honor belongs to another overrated artist The Eagles, whose first Greatest Hits set has outsold this by a million or two."
3,4 Great and 5 medicore songs,This is an ok album..Nothing more..nothing less. Those geniuses claiming that this is the best album ever recorded should go out there and search for more music.
