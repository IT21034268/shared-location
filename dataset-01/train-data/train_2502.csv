5,Still wonderful after all these years!,"Most of these songs were recorded with very primitive mono equipment in less than desirable surroundings. However, this is still one of the best rock recordings ever made. If you like Buddy Holly, you must own this. If you haven't listened to this album or his music for ages, buy this. You won't be disappointed. Enough said."
4,Seriously underated,"Amen Corner suffered from the tag of ""teenyboppers"" during their brief career, but these guys knew their chops, and toured long & hard - their live set was memorable and they appeared as a headlining band with the Move & Jimi Hendrix (ahead of a small time band called Pink Floyd).Any Fairweather-Low (AFL) had a distinctive wail, perfect for this R&B; tinged pop - the version of Gin House Blues here is a definitive performance, and was their 1st hit.AFL went onto a mildly successful solo career, before settling into a long time position as Eric Clapton's sideman - an indication of the guy's credentials."
5,extra! extra!,"decca era? decca era! yyyeeeaaahhhhh!""who are you waiting for?""""amen corner decca recordings!""oh! now everyone's CD-Player into ""Amen Corner Decca Collection!"""
4,Another wonderful story from Stephanie Grace Whitson!,"While Walks the Fire is still probably my favorite Whitson novel, Nora's Ribbon of Memories continues the author's tradition of fascinating story-telling. It was a joy to ""meet"" Karyn and Mikal Ritter (From Karyn's Memory Box) again, and I especially enjoyed the clever intertwining of the contemporary storyline with the historical. I always eagerly look forward to a new Whitson novel!"
3,Nora's story interweaves with earlier book storylines,"Nora is a teenager who leaves an abusive home to end up as the housekeeper in a brothel in Lincoln, Nebraska in the 1800's. She really does not ""fit"" so townspeople help her find her niche as a milliner. Probably the most intriguing part of the book is the revelation of the identity of blond, handsome, actor Grayson Chandler, the heartthrob of Nora. It is interesting to renew old friends Mikal and Karyn Ritter and others from Karyn's Memory Box, but somehow, the story does not flow as well. However, Whitson is a talented writer and this book is worth the time."
4,connie j.,"I especially liked this book because of its continuing storyline concerning Reagan Bishop and Noah Ritter, I'm ashamed to say. Reading about poor Nora and all her hardships were just in the way of what was going on between Reagan and Noah. True, the story dragged a bit, particularly when Nora was in the brothel, but it made for wonderful reading. You won't be sorry for your purchase."
3,Not as good as Karyn's Memory Box,"This story is actually about a girl who runs away from her abusive father and learns self-esteem. While I felt sorry for Nora, I never really liked her or the story line. Unlike all of this authors other books, this one did not flow and was disappointing after Karyns Memory Box, which I would rate much higher."
4,"Good Source on Hinduism, but Don't End Here","The Upanishads illuminated that the Self (Atman) is connected to the all-pervasive Brahman, and that to realize the Self and the connection to Brahman is to attain Enlightenment and escape from the cycle of Samsara (Moksha). While I am not an expert on the Sanskrit or its translation, this version is very accessible, and has been around for over 50 years. It has stood the test of time. It illustrates the Upanishads and their concern with attaining Moksha and awareness of the inexpressible, unknowable Brahman. This itself can be both illuminating, and repetitive. I recommend it to those who also read the Bhagavad Gita, where a stronger sense of ethics and duty are spelled out. This abridged version is short and accessible."
4,To know God is to know the Self,"The term Upanishad has been translated in many ways, ""sitting near devotedly"", ""secret teachings"", and the more elaborate, ""knowledge of God."" It is the knowledge of God that truly captures the essence of the Upanishads.The 7th century scholar, Shankara, describes the Upanishads as ""the knowledge of Brahman, the knowledge that destroys the bond of ignorance and leads to the supreme goal of freedom."" Each Upanishad illustrates the path towards discovering this inner knowledge, thus achieving escape from samsara, or this world of suffering.This translation contains the twelve standard Upanishads, including one of the most famous, the Brihad-aranyaka, which is the oldest and largest of these ancient scriptures.This work embodies the mystical and esoteric aspects of ancient Hindu philosophy, and serves as an interesting and enlightening guide to knowledge of Self."
2,GREAT DESIGN; MAJOR FLAW,THE DESIGN IS PERFECT FOR THE MAGELLAN'S...BUT THE SUCTIONCUP WILL NOT ADHERE TO TODAYS CAR DASHES. THE ONLY PLACE ITWILL STICK IS TO THE WINDOWS. I'M NOW IN THE PROCESS OF ORDERING A PIECE OF SHEET METAL TO STICK TO THE DASH AND THENMOUNT IT TO THE METAL. IT IS NOT GOING TO BE AN EASY PROJECTBECAUSE OF THE WEIGHT OF THE MAGELLAN. I WILL NOT RESORT TO'SCREWS' IN MY DASHBOARD.........AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN...A BETTER IDEA FOR DASH MOUNT IS NEEDED. DASHBOARDS ARE RIPPLEDPLASTICS OR A NONPOURUS MATERIAL........SO IT JUST 'WON'T' WORK.
3,It works,"I have a Megellan Maestro 4000 and this mount did not fit our unit. However we did not need the hardware that our unit connects to, we needed only the mounting suction cup. So we were able to attach the new suction cup to the old mounting piece and had what we needed. But this unit does not fit the 4000."
1,I was disappointed...,"I received my copy of Travels today and was disappointed when I opened it. The cover has a nice photo on it, but is made of foam-core board (a thin sheet of styrofoam sandwiched between two pieces of heavy art paper) that is easily damaged or dented. There are 8 sections, but only two pages in each, not 823 as described above, clearly a typo.The section dividers are very nice and the quality of paper is high, but the size of the paper, 11"" x 12"" is an odd size and refills are not available from any scrapbooking or photo supply company I've found on the web.The design does not allow the book to be opened flat while viewing, again making it more vunerable to cover damage. The manufacturer, Bound+d/termined does not carry this album or refills on their web site.I have traveled a lot and was looking forward to creating a great memory book of my many trips that would be handled frequently and passed on to others. Unfortunatly, this is not the album I can or will use."
5,Good show,"I thought this was a wonderful documentary on who wrote the bible. As some of the other reviewers state, this was done unbiased. They present information for and against any hypothesis they present. It should give one a clearer idea of where this wonderful book came from."
2,The world as a source of experiences,"Robin Magowan is a poet, and these travel vignettes are written with an extravagance of language, crammed with metaphor and simile, that was sometimes striking but more often came off as pretentious and overdone. Furthermore, he's a seeker of exoticism, and that's not necessarily a good thing; there's an insistence on seeing everything as manifestations of the mystery of the East, or as emanations of the deep national character of such and such people, that illuminates a lot less about the places he travels than about his own sensual tastes. In some of the chapters he has lots of sexual adventures, and in others it's about his spiritual and artistic life; somehow this didn't appeal to me enough to get me to read the whole thing."
3,some entries good some bad,"The whole discussion of psychiatric concepts like depression, autism, or schizofrenia is limited to listing of symptoms and research results on whether they are purely physiologically determined etc..if this is the state of psychiatric understanding of human mind and its illnesses today, then its probably true that were living in very oppressive societies.. otherwise entries on psychological issues like intelligence or visual perception give good introductions to the state of current research.. can be of some help as a general referance work but dont expect any serious illuminations.."
4,http://www.infidels.org/infidels/products/books/,_The Oxford Companion to the Mind_ is an excellent reference source of information on various mental phenomena. It was relevant to my essays because several entries dealt with the current state of the parapsychological evidence and how that related to the question of survival of bodily death
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this dvd to expose my children to traditional Hispanic music. I was a bit disappointed at the animation used throughout. For each song the action tended to repeat itself every 15 seconds - a bit boring. Then, the English version was an exact replica of the Spanish. The end result is a video that is not very engaging to its main target - toddlers and young children!"
2,Brown pages and poor packaging,The book arrived damaged with brown pages and damaged cover. It was supposed be new so this was disappointing will order locally next time !!. Content is fantastic though....!!!!!
2,Ax Ground,"It's not very well researched and many of the references don't checkout. The author abandon's context to press her own obvious adjenda. It is sad the author needs to twist situations, histories, and texts to such extreme ends...she would have much more convincing if she didn't make up such loose interpretation. At times it's a mere soapbox and the dogma transparent. Please, anyone who reads this, do so with a critical eye. Don't take what is written as factual just because it's what you've always wanted to hear. I enjoyed the encyclopedia, but know it must be held to the same standards of scrutiny as anything else which proclaims truth."
1,It stinks,This book is chucked full of information..over 1000 pgs to be exact..dealing mostly with mythological figures..I can read mythology from any high school book.
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!!,"I ran across this guy while listening to Pandora and i'm so glad i did! He is super hilarious dude that can pull off comedy without being overtly negative, vulgar, or crass. I think he is now one of my favorite comics...and im black. Lol"
2,Disappointing,The product varies not only from the picture but also from the product description. The tea and cookies I received did not match the description at all. The purple loofah noted in the picture does not come with the basket. The body lotion and bath gel are made in China.
3,Keson RR410 Measuring Wheel,Device measures distances accurately. I removed stand that would hang up in brush. Smooth surfaces would be no problem. Extending handle required retightening.
4,"How can it measure up to ""You Will Go to the Moon""?","I just heard about this book, and while I haven't read it yet,other projects from Buzz Aldrin make me confident it will a fineand important contribution.However, I'm sure it won't have the impact of Mae BlackerFreeman's ""You Will Go to the Moon"" from 1959 (and rewritten in1971). Rather sad really, in 45 years we've gone from a confidentprediction to the struggle to reach the moon to having no meansto get there.What will it take to inspire a new generation of kids?"
1,Don't bother,Poorly edited - says it covers more than Enron - just barely. Don't waste the money or time.
3,Pretty Good cut,I like the Lyrics&how the Groove works. not amongest there Best stuff but it works pretty Good for storytelling&metaphor within the song.catchy&Cleaver which is part of there Formula for Success.
3,What happened,My 4 and 6 year old enjoyed the book. They just wanted to know what was so bad. What was so bad that a child would think that thier mother would not love them anymore. We would have given a better rating if we knew what was so bad.
5,Dinosaur lovers will love this!,Great combo book with both stickers and dinosaur information. Plenty of scenes to place stickers and the book boasts you can remove the stickers which we haven't tried yet. They really do glow in the dark and you can see their skeletons then.
3,very small,"I was disappointed with this book. My 4 year old loves dinosaurs so I thought this would be great. He did enjoy it, it was just smaller than I expected. I often get the sticker books for him from costco, and they are much larger. I'm sure the product info tells how many pages are in the book, so that's my fault for not looking. If I had been paying attention I wouldn't have spent the money on this book. That said, my son did like the stickers, I just wish there were more of them. I don't feel I got my moneys worth."
2,"Quite nice, but kids were bored very quickly","This isn't a very big book and not a huge amount of stickers. I guess I expected too much. The my kids (both boys, ages 5 and 3) were initially thrilled, but were quickly bored and the stickers weren't tremendously sticky and came off and didn't stick back on very well. Product was okay, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get another one."
4,Indispensible!,"The indispensible Gaelic/English search engine for names and surnames. Found everything I was looking for and some surprises as well!Names that can't be found anywhere else are easily found here, as well as their variations, branches and connections. Most importantly, County references are included, to help you track that obscure name right to the homeland source. The Gaelic-English listings allow you to see the names as written in the old tounge.The introduction is a scholarly and enlightening discussion of the history of naming and how it evolved in Gaelic over the centuries.The typeface could be of better quality, and loses this book a star; fuzzy reproductions are an unfortunate blemish on a work of this research value."
3,"Decent phrasebook, but missing a couple of things...","I don't speak Vietnamese to rate the translations and phrasing used in this pocket-sized guide, but I have used a number of Lonely Planet phrasebooks for languages that I do know more about. This guide follows the format of those other guides, broken down into sections by situation, with a 2-way dictionary at the back and a pronounciation guide at the beginning of the book.Two notable omissions. There is not a section on ""love and dating"" as there is in every other LP Phrasebook I've used.Also, unlike the Russian phrasebook, which contains the english phrase, a phonetic pronounciation, and then the actual spelling, this book does not contain a phonetic spelling. For a language likely to be as difficult as Vietnamese for native English speakers and considering that such speakers are the book's target audience, phonetic spellings (indicating inflection as well) would help a lot.Still, a decent phrasebook as LP ones tend to be."
3,Excellent Phrase Book,"An nice, small companion for those needing a quick reference. Its dimensions ensure that that the book will fit neatly into a pocket or pack, and frequently needed phrases are easy to locate. This reference guide also includes a Vietnamese-English / English-Vietnamese dictionary, though the selections are rather slim. A little more information on pronounciation would be ideal, but as this book is geared more for the traveller, the basics are well addressed.Phrases are collected according to what you think you'll need to ask - so you'll find a section with phrases and words for ordering food, for going to a doctor, and for talking to locals. As a tool to help you learn some vocabulary, there are small crossword puzzles...which are more of a nice afterthought than something really useful.Definitely not exhaustive by any stretch of the imganation, but well worth the money if you need a quick reference guide."
1,watch out,"Glancing through several pages of the book, I was very unimpressed. I am fluent in both the northern and southern dialects of Vietnamese; this book looks like it will help you with neither. The diagram and explanation of tones is simply incorrect. The pronunciation guide is also confusing and imprecise. Save yourself the money and time. Keep looking. For intermediate-level students of Vietnamese, I would recommed ""Colloquial Vietnamese"" by John Moore and Tuan Duc Vuong. For beginners, I hear that ""Elementary Vietnamese"" by Binh Ngo is a good bet."
2,"Be careful of ""gently used""","I have nothing wrong with the actual product itself, just be careful of buying used copies. The one I received had multiple faded pages making the accent marks hard to make out on the words which is essential with Vietnamese. The content of the book itself was adequate though I have seen better by Lonely Planet, namely the Japanese version, it works in a pinch, just buy it new."
1,Great but check your player,"Pay attention to the format. this will only play on your computer unless you have a pal format. This is PAL format...it will not play on U.S. region dvd players, otherwise the movie is as good as I remember"
3,hmmm,"this was my first audio of Mariannes'. i had read ""a woman's worth"" many years back and really enjoyed it, so when i saw this at a book store, i quickly snatched it up and i am glad i did.i must agree with other reviewers however and say it is a bit disorganized in terms of sticking with the ""handling fear"" theme that i had expected when i bought it. with that out of the way i can attest that the messages in the material are really valuable, at least to me. i further appreciated that while the audio quality itself is not the best- it is a live recording and her deliverance of the material is passionate and engaging. i have listened to all of the discs several times as it is a lot to absorb- my ego gets overwhelmed easily:) i am online today ordering another set of hers... power to change."
2,Handling fear,"Perhaps I have listened too many of her tapes, but I did not get much from it. It was supposed to be about fear, but it did little explain how to handle our everyday fear. The big thing on this one related to the fear of a earthquake. Now how is that going to help someone in Iowa? This one is a hodge-podge things that are not connected in any way. I am definitely taking a break from her although her thoughts and approach to life is valid. However, if I have to hear ""let us see a little golden ball..."" I think I will go nuts."
3,"Great Acting, But Incomplete","As usual, Max Von Sydow is excellent in his role of the great Nobel Laureate and Norwegian novelist, Knut Hamsun.To be sure, I would've liked to see the director and producer delve back deeper into Hamsun's history. I think his formative years and time in America would have been more than worthwhile to chronicle. Hamsun was an incredibly lucid and accomplished author and one of the more compelling figures of the 20th Century. The totality of his life is a lesson in perserverance, rugged individualism, and originality. A more complete representation of his life is required to give viewers what they deserve."
2,lab manual for millers env science,it is very good but it has many labs that have more lab materials than I have at my disposal. i wish there were more virtual labs or ones with less equipment
3,"Interesting, a pretty easy read","I picked up this book because I am a professional interpreter of 8 years and was curious about how the title character was portrayed. I thought the descriptive passages about both interpreting and medical research (which I've also worked in) were pretty accurate and provided good insights for anyone who is interested in these fields. I agree with other reviewers that the love story was not really the point for me. The novel is somewhat slow-paced, don't expect John Grisham-type suspense."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. After a disappointing 75 pages, I found I had no desire to read anymore. The narrative was not interesting and the story seemed to going nowhere, instead continuously look at the past."
3,"A warning about the sound, band is in fine form + the best Candlemass album cover isn't a Thomas Cole painting, it's this one!","On the back page of the cd booklet it states: ""This album is very f----- live!!"" They are not kidding! This album sounds like it was matrixed from a soundboard and a field mic during a day set at an open air concert (if you've listened to a lot of bootlegs, you'll know what I'm talking about). A very good field mic and soundboard mix, granted, but it's not the slick and polished sound from, say, their ""Live"" (@Fryshuset) album in the 1990s. I understand their decision for producing the album this way, it just makes it hard to listen to it over and over again because it sounds like you're listening to a bootleg.I feel that the best performances on these discs are ""Dark Are The Veils of Death"", ""Samaritan"", ""Mourner's Lament"", ""The Well of Souls"", ""A Sorcerer's Pledge"" and ""Solitude"", odd because most of those aren't my favorite Candlemass songs."
1,Informative but Vulgar,"I bought this book online because it was recommended as a good book to teach adjectives. While it had a multitude of adjectives, I found that it also reinforced the word stupid. While the word was used in the context of the sentence ""They tell us that shows are stupid or funny,"" I hesitate in teaching my students that stupid is an acceptable word to use in any situation. Other then that, I found the book to be colorful, full of content and entertaining."
5,Immensely watchable biopic,"Most reviews seem to indicate this is a fictional movie. One reviewer wrote ""How can you compare Guru to Gandhi?"" These people seem to have missed the biopic part. This movie is based on the life of Mr. Dhirubhai Ambani and his company Reliance. The newspaper owner shown is essentially dramatization of Mr. Ramnath Goenka and his English daily ""Indian Express"". The man who did not want him to do business is none other than Mr. Wadia from Bombay Dyeing. How's Mr. Ambani comparable to Gandhi? His empire is the largest in India, he is one of the largest employer in the country. His sons are in the top 10 richest people in the world. He not only did things for himself, he took the whole country into the 21st century. He is responsible for making cell phones available to the most poor in the country & the list is endless....Fairly accurate biopic of Mr. Ambani."
4,Insights into our pain,"Ok, that's a dramatic review title. But this appears to be a mostly up front biography. It shows how the finance on the national level is trying to deal with multiple arenas -- primarily economic and political of coures -- in making the choices they do. Reading this I began to both respect the players in this game, and understand the slippery slope they are cast upon that results in the crazy growth of sovreign debt we see going on right now.If you have any interest in how economics works on a global level, and how the major players think, this is is a must read."
4,Very Good Book,"This is an excellent book about politics from the eyes of a very smart and successful business man. His insight on politics, economics and the stock market are valuable.Thanks to Mr. Rubin for taking the time to put his thoughts into a book for the public."
3,Conspicuously Absent from Mr. Rubin's Biography,"Conspicuously absent from this account is any mention of how Mr. Rubin feels we should deal with issues of compensation for corporate executives, how we should deal with regulating the use and abuse of complex deritives trading, how we can prevent the treasuries of bankrupt corporations being raded by the officers of the corporations. There was no discussions of most of the injustices in the tax code which was barely discussed at all. There were no meaningful suggestions of how we might prevent future Enron type problems."
3,Rationalizing my time with the creep,"Take one intelligent, successful man and have him spend more than six years of his life working with and for some of the most unprincipled cretins to ever run this country's government and what you get is 400 pages of self-delusion masquerading as insight. According to Mr. Rubin, the Clinton White House was run like a well-oiled machine, Hillary was open to those critical of her views and George Stephanopopopolous isn't really as dumb as he looks. If you want to take the most fascinating trip through a parallel universe since one of the original Star Trek episodes, read this book. But if you like your nonfiction planted firmly somewhere this side of reality, you would have a better chance of finding it watching Survivor."
2,The Final Verdict,"The Final VerdictFor OJ to be guilty, you must believe that he quickly disposed of the bloody clothes, shoes, and knives so they would NEVER be found, yet brought the socks and glove back to his home! And then smeared blood all over the console!The coroner who did the autopsies testified ""the forensic evidence says the murders occurred after 11PM"". The limousine driver testified he brought OJ to the airport at that time. When you read this book, note how they avoid discussing these facts."
4,Riveting and truthful,Interesting and I thought factual. Later stages concentrates on placing blame on the lack of conviction.But all considered...a must read.
3,We may never know,"I read this book when it first came out and concluded there was too many questionable points that are hard to explain such as the gloves, the blood and 'his Bronco' leaving the scene etc. Since I am not a forensics expert, I will not attempt to decide guilt or innocence, evidence is there to prove the case, just too many questions. I am glad I was not on the jury."
5,Hard to stomach.,"This book isn't hard to stomach because of bad writing style or anything in that vein. It is hard to stomach because it describes, in detail, all the extremely incriminating evidence WHICH POINTED TO NO ONE BUT SIMPSON that was found by the detectives in this case and the Los Angeles Police Department which, inexplicably, was not raised by the prosecutors EVEN ONCE during the trial. This book proves Simpson's guilt beyond ALL doubt, showing that had ALL this evidence been displayed before the jury in the criminal joke (it's an insult to courtrooms and the hallways of justice throughout this world to call it a trial) then Simpson would have undoubtedly been convicted. But most of all, ""Evidence Dismissed,"" like Vincent Bugliosi's ""Outrage"" proves once and for all that the TRUE blame for the loss of this case can be laid at the feet of the prosecution."
4,The book that should have been read to the criminal jury,"While there is lots of self-serving, cover-our-ass, if-anybodyscrewed-up-it-wasn't-us stuff in this book, it is still a mustread for anyone interested in the trial of the century. Learn howbig a hurry Marcia Clark was to get the case only to ignoresome of the most telling evidence. No doubt Clark's book willlay the blame at someone elses perverbial briefcase...I willnever know. This is the last of the genre for me. Read it forthe cops view and American Tragedy for the Defense angle...thenread something worthwhile."
4,Fascinating look @ how police collected evidence against O J,The reader is led through the collection of evidence against O.J. Simpson beginning when the authors were first called to investigate the case. Common misconceptions about the conduct of the L.A.P.D. are cleared up. The mistakes that were made by the detectives are dealt with frankly and honestly. This book is well written and is objective as possible given that it was written by persons so close to the case
1,Their vendettas are distracting,"These two detectives seem to have entered into the book deal to vent their dislike (hate? too strong a word?) toward detective Mark Fuhrman and Marcia Clark, among others involved in the O. J. Simpson murder trial. Both they and Marcia Clark belittle Simpson's lawyers. Even Judge Ito was irate toward Detective Vannatter! But, Simpson's lawyers won, after the prosecution's evidence became suspect due to their bungled collection. Their constant attacks on Fuhrman in tiny sniping ways leave me disgusted. Bottom line, Simpson's ""rat pack"" WON because of THEIR bungles. I simply lost interest in their tale."
4,Canyon,Well written narrative that provides good information about the Colorado River at higher levels. Decent adventure story and also captures some of the magic or running the river in this magnificent canyon.
3,Downsized Cuddl Duds,"Ah, the joy of outsourcing clothing manufacturing. Bought this cuddl dud to replace one purchased 10 years ago. Then, they were made in the USA. Today, Mexico,tomorrow China? Problem is, the same size purchased today is about 1/2 to 1 size smaller than 10 years ago. Do you think there may be some cost cutting here? The fabric is not as plush and the stitching of a lesser quality. I can only award 3-stars for these reasons. Otherwise, it does what it is advertised to do. (be an undergarment)"
4,Good bbedtime reading for kids with attatchment disorders,"I found this book easy to read to my 10 year old,who has adhd & attachmentdisorder.Being written in fairytale format means it can deal with a lot of issues which could be difficult to approach with children of this sort of age.It certainly encouraged my son to discuss some issues from his past he had not felt able to talk about previously.The parenting guide in the the back was also useful & would have been even more so for someone who didn'talready have some knowledge of attachment issues & how they effect children.I would certainly recommend it to anyone bringing up a traumatized childwhether fostered, adopted, or biological as my son is."
2,Attention Sub Buffs; This Is Not A Sub Story,"Very well written and creative as heck. The character descriptions are a bit too long and/or unnecessary, but overall, you read it very smoothly. However, NOT, repeat, NOT a sub story. I judged the book by its cover and was taken by the marketing department."
1,Unfortunately poorly written dialogue ruined this book for me,"After reading Mannock's first novel, Iron Coffin, I expected to find another well-written novel. Unfortunately, I found this second novel to be poorly written due to very stilted and unbelieavable dialogue which basically wiped out the merits of the fine story line. A quick search of the internet indicates that the I-400 series subs actually existed as did the other defenses (mini-subs, suicide divers and boats) described in the book. Hopefully, the dialogue will improve in future books by Mr. Mannock."
4,WOW! A POPCORN BONANZA!!!,"It's gonna take a long time, but I am determined to try at least 31 of the 50 ways to pop and enjoy corn that this little gem of a book suggests you experience. So far I've got 11 tried and marked, along with comments from me and my family and friends who were here when the popping took place. Nine trials got basically thumbs up while two have black X's across their recipes and probably will not be used again. But, what fun!! Suprise your folks with a different taste every time, BUT, DO NOT LOAN OUT YOUR BOOK! I did and it took 3 weeks to get it back. Happy popping!"
4,"Well written, Unavoidable Truths","Most of the negative comments on this book are just like those english teachers that give you a ""D"" or ""F"" because they disagree with your opinions. Unfortunately, many don't address the book for how it's written and how the material is presented. Shapiro presents well shaped arguments agianst the pathologically degrading nature of pornography and how it has ruined many people's lives. The truth is, there isn't much, if any, literature that provides ""compelling"" evidence that pornography is a good thing for our society and culture. Shapiro wants to inform his readers that beyond the glitz, glamour and riches of the porn industry, there is a very dark side. Personnaly, I think he does a pretty good job of it. Agree or disagree, his points are shared by many people, and should at least be fairly considered by any who are interested in the debate over the spread of pornography in our society."
4,An eye-opening and much-needed book,"Ben Shapiro's Porn Generation goes where most people fear to tread - against the grain of modern pop-culture. Although most of us intuitively understand that American society as a whole seems to be slipping into an amoral abyss, Mr. Shapiro's research and detailed examples are striking. He builds a strong case against the music, advertising, television and movie industries - which have become soft-core porn producers.The reason this doesn't get five stars is that Mr. Shapiro sometimes ends his insightful examples with juvenile name calling and snide comments. Overall, though, this is an extremely important book that should be required reading for all parents and concerned Americans."
5,Porn Generation,Fantastic book.I purchased it a while back and I just started reading it.I recommend it to anyone that wants a better understanding of what is happening in our school system and in our country.
2,Disappointing,Not as good as his other book Brainwashed. I loved that one and read it in about 2 days time. This book was just hard to read and boring compared to his first book.
1,Do people make stupid choices? Yes. Should we stop them? No.,"Being of very nearly the same age as the author and having seen the same things, I could agree that society is taking a turn for the worse. However, while I might agree with his criticism of, let us say, sluts, whores, and their ilk, I find the idea of censorship highly disturbing indeed.Should people be more restrained in their activities? Sure. I don't want to hear about teenage pregnancies or Paris Hilton's latest flick on the net. Should we force people to do what we decide is moral? No.We declared our independance claiming the rights of Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. My rights haven't been abridged by social liberalism; in fact, I now have more ability to pursue my rights than ever before. I fail to see why I should abridge these rights through what amounts to censorship."
1,Author needs some aging,"The entire time I was reading this book, all I could think was that Mr. Shapiro needs more years under his belt before he writes another book. The politik he presents and his ""solutions"" are more shocking than the alleged attack on ""morality"" he wails about. His premises are baseless, his conclusions smack of an utter lack of emotional maturity. Clearly this topic needs to be hashed through by a much more mature and emotionally intelligent writer. Don't bother reading this nonsense, you'll only feel violated that you've utterly wasted your time. Sorry, Ben. Wait another ten years when you have more life experience before tackling the big issues. You just completely missed reality on this one."
5,"Go get 'em, Ben!","I love the way the left attacks Ben. They've been doing it for three years now, ever since his national column started, and they're getting more hysterical the more prominent he gets. For those of you who don't know his columns, this book is only a continuation of the full frontal assault he's been making on the left's contempt for everything America has always stood for. It's concise, savagely funny, and hones in like a laser beam on the left's amorality. And just the other day, Ann Coulter announced she wants to nominate Ben for the Supreme Court. She's too old for you, Ben, but I'm not!"
3,good looking andthat's about it,"my wife bought me this overpriced figure. i didn't see the justification spending 5 times the regular price for this batman. sure it looks good, and the fanboys want the extra head, but for me, i am used to the newer 4horsemen sculpt with extra articulation. would i buy this for regular price? maybe."
2,Not terribly happy with this one....,"I have a few comments about this chessboard. I bought it for only ten bucks a few months ago at a retail toy store, so the price is right, but.....read on. The board itself looks like it is etched glass but it isn't. I was playing last night with a friend who was eating Cheetos. Somehow little Cheetos pieces landed on the board...I hope it was when I got him with the surprise checkmate! Anyway, I went to clean it off this morning and wherever Cheetos had landed they had lifted off the white opaque covering/etching that passes for the filled-in squares. That's why I am here looking for chessboards right now - I am going to have to toss this one. I'd guess I'd buy another for only ten bucks, but I'd consider it a disposable board and try to keep it away from any food or water. But I really want a nicer set, one that is reliable, which is exactly what I am doing here."
2,Not as great as the picture,"I bought this chess set for my husband (I would NOT recommend it for kids) about a month ago. Already one piece broke when it fell about 1 1/2 feet to the carpet and hit another piece. They are not very durable. also the little felt bottoms on each piece are yellowed and some have lost their stickiness and are falling off. I recommend the game of chess, just not this set."
2,chess,"The chess set was what I expected,however I expected the case to be a little more durable since the chess set is made of glass."
3,Think twice...,"My 13 year old is an avid Chess player and loved this set. However..it is GLASS and glass breaks...awfully easy. It looks great, but breaks easily if pieces fall on granite counters or tile floors."
2,BIG dissapointment!,"The only semi-impressive thing I found about this game might be the graphics...other than that it was a big let down. Dull and boring, even my kids didn't like it."
3,"Good, but basic","I bought this camera after quite a bit of research as I had limited funds, but still wanted a quality item. I've owned it for nearly a year & will say that it definitely is nice & compact, user-friendly, & shoots quality video. I did not buy it for the digital image ability as I was told that it really didn't take quality pictures.My one & only complaint is that there is no way to download the video onto a PC. I was told by a Costco rep. that it had those capabilities, which was a huge selling point for me. At the time, I was 8 months pregnant & by the time I had a chance to attempt a download, my 90-day return ability was long gone. Had I been able to, I would have immediately returned it & paid a little more money for something I could eventually burn onto a CD or DVD.So, if you're fine with VCR tapes or just keeping your video files on the mini-tapes, then by all means, purchase this product because it really is a good deal for the money."
1,Utter disappointment,"Although, in the preface, the author boldly mentions how the reader may pay additional gratuity if the book is found to be especially worthwhile, he makes no mention of how to obtain a full refund.For someone who makes explicit claims toward precision, Galambos' much-celebrated concepts are fuzzy and defined in terms of non-essentials (as if he were inspired by Rand but never paid any particular attention to her). Discussion of each definition consists of a string of true propositions, interspersed with jokey asides, which haven't been assembled into a chain of argument, and which rarely include reference to evidence, except in the most general way. Perhaps these shortcomings could be blamed on sloppy editing, and perhaps Sic Itur Ad Astra is much better. I'll never know.If you're looking for a book on liberty with stunning arguments, why not try Spooner? If you're looking for a book on liberty with a novel historical perspective, why not try Nock?"
4,Walk in Joy,"A practical, inspirational, instructional guide to walking meditation. The book is small enough to carry with you. Refer to it often as a reminder to walk in joy."
3,walking meditation handbook,"Book was good and easy to take along w/ you as you walk, but price was too high for such a small book."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I upgraded to Sibelius 5 last year. As with another reviewer, since upgrading I have experienced frequent crashes and freezes. This can be particularly frustrating and time-wasting (as you typically lose your work).Considering the price of this program, you would expect that, at the very least, it would run longer than 30 minutes before crashing.Save your money. Steer clear of this product."
4,Learning Curve,"It's a great product, to be sure. It just takes a little getting used to. There will probably be plenty of roadblocks and a handful of bugs, as well as a lot of time spent on the help forums. It may prove to be especially frustrating for people coming over from Myriad Software's Melody Assistant program. But don't panic! All the abilities and bells and whistles are there; they just take a little tracking down to get to.The sounds are also far superior to Melody's sounds. But the one drawback I found particularly annoying was that you couldn't preview the sounds before you assign them to a staff. You have to build the staff and write the music first, *before* you get to hear what it sounds like."
1,Sibelius 5.0 - Largely Non-Functional,"I bought this product as Sibelius 5.0 approximately one year ago. Despite many attempts to fix it, it continues to crash approximately one time each 30 minutes. Each time it crashes,I loose much of the previous 30-minutes of work. The technical advice in the websites does not seem to work. The instructions are gibberish to non-technical people such as most musicians. It has been impossible to download the version 5.25 upgrade. On the plus side, between each crash Sibelius seems to function well, but this is little consolation, because the frequent crashes make it impractical to use this product for composition. I have not tried Finale yet so I cannot compare the programs."
5,Mini Myths and Legends of Oklahoma Indians,"As a small child, I remember my grandparents, parents, and Aunts and Uncles telling me these stories that are now written in this book. I enjoyed listening to the different stories of various tribes from Oklahoma. I shared the stories in this book with my children as they were growing up, and now want to share these stories, not only with my grandchild, but other children in grade schools that are interested in Native American storytelling. The pictures are great! My husband amazingly had kept this same book as he was growing up! Now we can both enjoy it together."
5,Great Lotion,This is my favorite hand lotion to use at the office. It moisturizes without leaving a greasy film behind. It also has a pleasant and mild scent I enjoy.
1,"It's 5 star, not the 1 star checked in error","For the years and over that I've owned this book, it has become a great resource as a clear, understandable explanation of Christian prayer and as a practical guide for taking prayerful action. In my service as the prayer leader at my church, I use it as the textbook for a beginning class on prayer, and extra copies of it don't last long in our ""bookstore."" My thanks to Richard Wagner for this handy guide!"
2,booooooring !,"a strange book. on the one hand the author has a decent and engaging writing style with engaging characters. on the other hand there is virtually no storyline or plot; rather a series of little incidents whoch read like ""a day in the life of"". there is zero suspense and i do mean zero. i passed half way through . sorry but do not rcommend."
1,amazon download issues,Cannot play movie on iPad mini. Lengthy Download time as well as download faults. When finally downloaded Movie keeps stopping. Sound is bad too.
3,Maybe I'm too critical,"But I was a little disappointed in this CD. I kept wishing Stephen Grapelli were playing it. It seemed too academic / careful rythym-wise; it had none of the insouciance (sic?) that the music seems to be asking for.As a violinist, I found his bow control to be a little on the 'mere-human' side (mine is so lousy, I'm probably over-sensitive to the problem). He seemed to be bouncing where he didn't want to, and there was a little noise where he was changing strings at times. It must be difficult stuff."
5,An excellent addition to any advanced astrological study,"I am a professional astrologer and student of astrology. I have been learning from this book for many years. It offers an interpretation of planets, signs and house that is both original and profound. I only use it occasionally for ""ordinary"" readings. But for myself, and a small circle of people who might be open to a more expanded (""cosmic"" if you will) view of things, this can be invaluable for understanding the themes at work in a lifetime. If you like this, consider Lonsdale's ""Inside Degrees"" as well."
3,Not for beginners,"I took one look inside this book and being a beginner knowing bearly nothing. This book is way beyond the beginner, its more novice. Or at least someone who knows something about it."
2,It's A Jumprope.,"This piece suffers from shoddy construction and questionable squeaky bearing design. It is non-adjustable. It functions decently, but is difficult to wear in. I'll stick with it as a low-speed basics rope, until I'm ready for a high speed rope. I do not recommend, as better constructed leather ropes are available for a nominal price increase."
2,Faceless Killers,What a disaappointment. The story meanders without really going anywhere and without any intrigue. It wraps up in the last chapters with a brand new ending. Convenient.
4,Good story,The story kept my interest throughout--easy to follow story that didn't jump around. Story line kept you wondering who committed the murder. I would read another book in this seriesm
3,Entertaining but not a great mystery story,Faceless Killers is good reading but it lacks one essential of a great mystery novel: there are no clues along the way to challenge the reader to solve the mystery before the author finally tells all. The story simply details how the police detectives went about discovering the facts as to what had happened.
4,Good characters and story,"I liked the main characters and the story was interesting.However, the last 20% of the book was not as creative and there wasn't any more character development. It seemed like a mad dash at the end to tie up the plot."
3,Dogged determination triumphs over all.,"If you like Ruth Rendell's Inspector Wexford, you'll like this main character. Wallender is a complex and somewhat tragic figure with lots of turmoil in his personal life. But he's also the kind of friend you'd want when you're down. His detective work is solid and there are plot twists that keep you guessing to the final ""ah-ha"". I will read more of his books."
2,Boring.....................................................,"Too bad too - great location - unique setting, names, places but all over the place in terms of plot. Little suspense; unsatisfactory conclusion - makes me wonder what 'international bestseller' means anymore."
3,Will I read any more Kurt Wallander books?,"This is my second Kurt Wallander Mystery and the first book in the series. As I mentioned in my review of Side-tracked it is my wife who is Mr. Mankell's big fan having read all of his books. I am not a big mystery fan so it would take a lot for me to be overwhelmed by a police procedural (as I guess they are called). So again here, I was not overwhelmed but I found the book entertaining and well written. Although I find it interesting that the case goes one direction all the way to the end only to have some small clue find things were not as they seemed. In this case the clue was rather hard to believe, but I guess it could happen. Will I read anymore Kurt Wallander books? Well I don't know but I understand Mankell has books with the daughter out now and that might be interesting to take in when the need to just be entertained on a plane is the mission at hand."
3,Fair Read,"With so many bad books in the market, this one, though far from exceptional, is a fair read. Also, the narrative is good enough to have you cling to it from the beginning. I think I am going through my ""North European Detective Novel"" phase. I'm reading Makell, Nasser and that Icelandic gentleman with an unpronounceable name."
3,The first Kurt Wallender book!,This is the first in the Kurt Wallander series and I had been thinking of reading this for some time now based on several recommendations. I was a bit underwhelmed to be honest. I wonder if it is becuase when you read a Swedish author now you sort of subconsciously compare him to Stieg Larsson (which to be fair is really not a greart comparison).I thought the book was ok but not great. I found it difficult to track all of the various characters and in particular the various policemen. That could have something to do with the unfamiliar names. The plot was a bit meandering. I couldn't quite follow the line of thinking on the nameless father of the kid.I give it basically 3 out of 5 stars and I may read the second one to give him one more chance but I am in no rush to do so.
1,Give me a break,"What a waste of time. The first few pages are intriguing. A murder. Some odd clues. Then the story wanders about for 200 pages. There's a subplot about the main character's estranged wife and his daughter, which goes nowhere. There's another subplot about his cantankerous demented father, which goes nowhere. Finally the author decides to get back to the plot and solve the crime, which turns out to be completely uninteresting, and all those intriguing clues? Well they turned out not to mean anything. This book is like a bad movie of the week that was cancelled and finally aired on Lifetime."
5,Written review,"Book was in excellent,good quality condition. Great, speedy delivery.I was very glad with the customer service. Would highly recommend. Happy to receive the book on time. I enjoy reading Henning Mankell books.Excellent writing and holds your interest."
2,Disappointing,"After learning about this series, I was excited to start with the first Kurt Wallander book. Unless the writer's story telling skills made large leaps from book to book, I will not be reading any more. Since the publication of this book, police procedural based mysteries have improved greatly. This one seemed dated and boring. As to ""whodunit"", it is irrevelant to the plot or story. Skip to later books in the series, if you find anything about the main character interesting."
1,Faceless Killers,"While reading this book, I frequently wondered, given the slow pace and dull writing, how it led to a popular series. I assumed that a blockbuster finish must be awaiting as my reward for trudging on through the bland story. Unfortunately the story ended in the same lackluster and unsatisfying way it began. I may give another of the books a try in hopes that they got better as they went along, but my hopes are not high."
1,Is this a joke?,"Did the author intend to depict an awful bumbling idiot making glaring oversights and more messing than clearing things up, or is the author himself a bumbling idiot ... ? I couldn't decide, but let me spare you the pain. This book is badly advertised as what to read after The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo. Couldn't be more wrong. None of the elements of those excellent books are here."
4,Faceless killers,"After seeing the BBC series on Masterpiece Mystery, all I have wanted was more stories about Kurt Wallender . Mankell's books give a deeper and broader scope into Kurt's life besides the murder at hand,which makes this book hard to put down. Faceless Killers is a very police crimemurder mystery.I can't wait to start reading the next book in the series"
3,Facelss Killers,'Faceless Killers' is a pleasant but not a compelling mystery. Kurt Wallender is a detective who is likewise unremarkable. What is interesting is the view of life in the Swedish countryside.
4,Faceless Killers,"I really like his writing style..and you can just feel the cold wind blowing and the misery of Wallander! And I love the PBS Masterpiece Mystery Wallander series.I do wish that you would include the 1st publishing date of ALL your books so I could purchase in sequence. When I find a new friend/character, I'd like to go back and pick up all the past books."
2,Pace less Killers,"This book or should I say author, was recommended to me by someone who I trust. I still like this person but not sure about this author. I found this book a chore to read, it was as if I was reading a police report straight out of a file. With a few character references mixed in, for distraction. I was not impressed and hope that after this book the author learned something about flow."
3,Faceless Killers,"The book is a translation of a Swedish murder mystery that begins with an elderly farmer discovering an open window at his neighbor's house. When he goes to investigate, he finds the man has been tortured and murdered; the woman has been tortured and is close to dead. The wife survives to arrive at the hospital but dies saying, ""Foreigner."" The book takes many twists and turns before the culprits are found. ***Spoiler. If you don't want clues on the outcome, read no further. I was, however, somewhat disappointed in that the reader did not have the opportunity to feel a part of the investigation; the culprits were not suspects until the last chapter. However, if your taste runs to Police Procedural, the book is filled with procedure and you will enjoy it.***"
2,For the Audiobook,"This review is for the Audiobook. I'm not a fan of the narrator. He sounds like he was drunk the whole way through. He made everyone sound really drunk and slurred their speech. It really affected the pace of the novel, slowed it down and didn't make it a very thrilling listen. I don't recommend the audiobook, but the book itself is pretty good, and the Wallander BBC production is also pretty good."
1,"Utterly, horribly, disappointingly boring.","Having read the positive reviews, I bought this book even though I had never heard of the author.What a mistake.The book starts off okay, then turns into a plodding pace with nondescript characters, plot development, and settings. While the translation could be partly to blamed, I'm under the impression that the original work/writer is the cause.Go read police procedural books by Michael Connely or John Sandford and skip this book altogether."
4,Faceless Killers,Author recommended by a friend. Enjoyed the book. Will read some of his other novels as well. I prefer American settings as I am not familiar with places in other countries.
4,Depressing,"I enjoyed this book but kept wondering why Scandinavian authors have to be so depressing. Wallanders daughter attempted suicide when she was fifteen and had been estranged from her father since. His wife had left him, wanted a divorce, and was living with another man, he was stopped by to fellow officers for drunk driving, his father was facing senility, and his best friend and most respected co-worker was dying of cancer. I was depressed and suicidal before I got halfway through the book. It did brighten up when he started having an affair with a lawyer who was married and his best friend from the past was refusing to accept his phone calls. None of that is a spoiler since none of that has anything to do with the murders.Still, it was an above average book. I just can't read Scandinavian often and survive."
4,Kurt Wallander's debut,"First a thank you to Amazon reviewers who praised this book so highly over the years. I bought the book on your recommendations and I was not disappointed. This is a fine police procedural with totally Swedish sensibilities. The place, climate and society are skillfully invoked by author Henning Mankell. Comparing ""Faceless Killers"" to later Wallender stories, you are even more impressed at the consistency of the writing and how the protagonist seems to spring fully formed in the first book. Read the latest (""last"") Wallander book and you find the same brooding, troubled, principled and intelligent character still struggling with his doubts and personal weaknesses.This is a fine mystery and very entertaining reading. Highly recommended."
4,Faceless Killers,A well done mystery that holds your interest and introduces a new detective characterthat I want to follow in further books.
4,Chuck90036,"As usual, mesmerizing, thought provoking, and at times shocking. Wallander continues to be one of favorite characters ever written. Jack reacher, Harry Hole, Harry Bosch, all favorites, by extraordinary writers. Just like wallander and Mankill."
4,A dark mystery,"If you have watched the Wallander series on PBS, you will like the original novel. It is similar, but also has more information on Wallander as a person and as a detective."
4,"Well paced, with an explosive ending","This is my second H. Mankell novel, and the first in his Kurt Wallander series. Like ""Sidetracked"", H.Mankell offers a police procedural with Kurt Wallander,with his extensive but not unique life baggage providing counterpoint and color to the investigation.I suggested in a review for ""Sidetracked"" that it seemed like a Swedish version of the John Sandford ""Prey"" series. This book is different in format, as we do not experience the crime, nor is there significant interaction with the perpetrators until the fast and furious conclusion.While the author skillfully creates the picture of the hodge podge of the Wallander's life, his colleagues are a bit murky and difficult to tell apart. The ending is explosive, and comes upon you suddenly."
4,Highly recommended.,"Although the translation into English made the dialogue a bit awkward at times, it did not take away from my enjoyment of the story. Wallander is fully dimensional, very fallible-yet-determined, and surrounded by strong supporting characters. Although told in third person, the writing has a first person feel in the way you know what's going on inside Wallander's thoughts. There's plenty of action and suspense, and even a red herring that leaves you feeling the frustration of Wallander trying to solve his case. It also introduced me to the problems in a country about which I hadn't previously known. I recommend the book and know I'll be looking for others by the author."
1,UnSATISFACTORY ITEM,"The item was received WITHOUT a USB cable...after purchasing a cable, it seems to work just fine.William HillKodak EasyShare Dock 6000 (for CX/DX 6000, LS 600 & LS 700 Series Cameras)"
2,Not worth it.,"As much as I stand behind Kodak's line of digital cameras. I donot at all recommend this dock. It is simply not practical. The only reason I own it is because it was a birthday gift. This dock is a scam, it does exactly what I think the usb adapter should have been able to do. Another thing is that it only charges the kodak brand batteries it comes with. Unless you're one of those people that just must have matching components, this item should not be on your wish list.What to do:For this price, you can get a pretty decent internal or usb multi-card reader (depending on your system) and Energizer rechargeables with a 30 min charger and you will still have a couple dollars left over."

5,Lo mejor de Mexico,"Con este CD Maldita Vecindad demuestra que es el mejor grupo de rock mejicano de los últimos años. Desde su impresionante disco Baile de Máscaras, Maldita se ha consolidado como un grupo histórico. Canciones con diferentes estilos musicales y con una mezcla adecuada de sonidos le dan la marca a este grupazo. Absolutamente recomendable."
2,Photosmart 325 prints better than Photosmart 375,"I first puchased the Photosmart 325 and was amazed at the quality of the pictures! They didn't look grainy and the pictures just were awesome, better than the store! Well I wanted a bigger screen and more features so I purchased the Photosmart 375! I thought the picture quality would stay or even be better but I was way wrong! The pictures I print are grainy and aren't what they should look like. I mean they don't look terrable but compaired to the cheaper model it doesn't match up.Bottom line is, if you want good pictures get the Photosmart 325 rather than features on the Photosmart 375.Features vs. Quality of pictures"
1,Defective out of the box,"The printer we were sent is stuck in a loop trying to print the alignment page. I loaded the software from the CD... computer says error loading software, hardware won't work properly. Went to web site downloaded ""updated software""... computer says error loading software, hardware won't work properly. Went to customer service site, told to load ""updated software""... reloaded updated software, still have error message. Customer service rep says, "" I think there may be a problem with the printer."" There is the understatement of the day, thank you. I now have to submit my credit card so they will send me a replacement and the printer we bought to be able to take with us on vacation to print our pictures will stay home,...in a box, ...on the counter because ""there may be a problem with the printer"". Inconvinient customer service, defective product and a two week wait for the replacement... what more could you ask for in a printer?"
5,Fantastic Results - HP 375 Compact Photo Printer,"The HP Photosmart 375 Photo Printer is an awesome printer based on the quality and features it delivers.

1,A Complete Joke,"I ordered this, got it overnight and it simply didn't work. First, I tried to solve the problem by going on-line. I got an online chat support person who asked me to wait because he ""needed to research the problem"" and after five minutes the chat session was discontinued. When I contacted HP by phone, they said they would ship a replacement overnight if I paid $10 extra. Two days later, they left a message that there would be a seven business day delay in shipping it! When I called to complain, no one seemed to be able to do anything about it. This is the same thing that happened to me with an HP printer five years ago, and I vowed then not to order anything again. I should have stuck to my guns. I have no printer, am out $200 and wonder if it will ever be solved! Then they sent me an email asking me to take a survey to see how I liked the service I got. Talk about a disaster!"
1,Gave up,"I never got the printer,I used all the track in formation and never got a respond,all I have is a pile of papper telling me how to trace the order,I just gave up JSC"
3,"A little too ""unga-bunga""","Even though this story dosen't stack up to ""Voice of the Eagle"", it still is a good light read. The creation of the cliff houses is really kinda skipped over, and about 10 years pass by in less than half a page and I am still trying to figure out the ""gift"" that Uhtatse has, I think it my be that he is an empath or something.A nice light read."
2,Sonoma Dieet,"It is just like any other diet, recipe booK. I did not keep it. I felt it wasn't enough of a book to keep in my library of books, diet and otherwise."
1,Not Much There,"Just another ""diet book"" with nothing different except trying to use the ""Sonoma"" ambience to sell a book."
3,New Year's Resolution,"Well, it was a Year's Resolution for us to trim down together. I've been on the diet for 10 days, not any real trimming or health changes. I have cut down on bad eating, and feel better about myself."
4,"Fun, tasty, and effective!","I found this book to be very effective. It's very informative as it tells you what to eat and why it's good for you. The most difficult part I found about this diet is the first ten days. However, once that part is over it's all downhill from there. The Sonoma diet has everything you need to start this diet. The recipes are delicious and easy to make. It even gives you reference as to what to eat on the go and at resturaunts.I lost about two pounds each week and still going strong. I suggest you give it a try!"
4,Sonoma Diet,The book was well written and easy to follow. It explained the diet and also gave many recipes. A few times I had to go back to review given information when it was referred to later on.
5,"Best ""Diet"" ever!","I have only got as far as the 10 power foods list when I started using those 10 power foods and have already in a little over a week, lost 3 poundsa - just changing what you eat, the quality and rightness of the food already helps the body to drop the extra weight, helps to clean out your system.Good advice and a wonderful read."
3,"Sonoma Diet: Trimmer Waist, Better Health in Just 10 Days",Excellant book for a healthy life style change.
5,An effective diet!,"This book is the best book I've purchased in a long time. It was in great condition, and has helped me lose weight! The recipes are great and I love the food. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a lifestyle change."
4,Good Information,"I learned a lot about food and nutrition in easy to understand language-interesting,practical,functional."
5,BEST DIET,This book has allowed me to include my diet needs and my parents' diet needs. This is the best diet ever. I believe anyone that wants to loose weight must have a diet for life. The sonoma diet is for life and has alot of flavor for those of us who like taste and loss of weight. I also recommend to be irresistible the book The Love Diet by Mabel Iam.
3,Its okay,"This book is okay, but I found that it was a spur of the moment purchase that I later regretted. Nothing really wrong with the content though."
3,Procastinating,"We haven't started the ""lifestyle change"" yet. I have read the book but not sure about eliminating sugar. I am a sugar-freak and already worried about cutting it out of my diet."
2,Disappointed,"This diet was too boring for me to want to try. I started reading the book and could not finish it. I looked at some of the recipes, and knew that I did not want to try them. They just did not sound appetizing to me."
1,The Sonoma Diet,"I used every recipe in this book to help my teenage Type I diabetic daughter find food that is healthy yet good. My husband and I ate the dinners while my daughter ate the breakfasts,lunches and dinners. We all loved them. I still use the recipes for every day."
3,Another darn diet,"Although this particular diet is one of the most flavor packed I have seen, it is still a diet. The first ten days you will lose weight, mostly because you are allowed to eat nothing but green veggies and spices. And there are some strange items on the allowed list, such as bamboo shoots, which I did not even know a person could eat! This diet is fabulous for koala bears, but limiting for human consumption."
1,South Beach Diet Re-Written,"I am very confused and surprised that the authors of this book were able to get it published and distributed! From the font, to the recipes, to the overall diet plan, this diet is almost an exact replica of the South Beach Diet--even their website is an exact copy! For a minute, I thought the same person had written each book! This diet has ""Waves"" (Wave 1, Wave 2, etc.). The South Beach Diet has ""Phases"" (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.). What an absolute crock!"
4,"Great plan, if you like to cook...",The food choices in this plan are great. It is healthy and very balanced. My only complaint is the amount of prep and cooking involved makes it difficult to follow for those that don't enjoy (or have time for) gourmet cooking.
4,Sonoma Diet,"This is a great book with amazingly flavorful food, but you have to be prepared to spend more time in the kitchen than usual. The flavor of the food and the weight loss that results makes it worth it, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who has a very busy lifestyle, unless you're willing to make some sacrifices."
4,Great way to kick off a new healthy eating lifestyle!!,"This book was an extremely easy read with great recipes included! The diet is easy to follow, although giving up sugar for 10 days was hard. But now that the first 10 days are over no one even knows I'm on a diet. I lost a total of 10 lbs in the first 10 days (even while cheating a few times)!! So over all a great way to kick off a new healthy eating lifestyle."
2,"good diet, poorly written book","I found the basic concept of the Sonoma Diet to be sound, but was put off by the contradictions, and ""used car saleman"", salesmanship used in the book. (classic bait and switch)Both my wife and I found the book quite confusing as it contradicted itself from page to page.Seven day's into the diet I have lost six pounds, but it is actually no different than any other nutritionally correct diet.(we're hungry, and my wife is tired of the constant food preparations already) If your looking at the Sonoma, be prepared to stay away from fast food resturants, and about 95% or full service resturants. Also be prepared to spend a LOT more on your grocery bill! Finally, I can't say I've found a better way to loose 7 lbs in a little over a week, but I'm a little irritated at the book's glossing over of the process."
1,Hmmm...this sounds familiar!!??,"This book sounds exactly like South Beach, except instead of ""waves"" there are ""phases"". South Beach promotes healthy eating with good carbs and good fats, lean meats, lots of fruits and vegetables, while staying away from the unhealthy processed foods and trans fats. In my opinion, if you already have the South Beach book, stick with that, because this seems to be the same thing with a different name. Either one will work, as long as you stick to it!!"
3,Undecided,"I looked through the book and the recipes look very delicious, but it is not a lot of things I usually buy and I have hesitated to start it. Some of the snacks are unusual (11 almonds ???)I think it is going to be an expensive grocery list and have not tried the diet yet."
2,Balance,"I happen to agree with ""Rex Chickeneater."" I spent 6 months in Turkey and during the summer months, I ate everything and anything without gaining an ounce, I credit the fact that I walked everywhere. When the rainy season began and I was walking less, the pounds started creeping on. I needed to increase my activity if I was going to eat the same foods and quantity of food as I had in the summer. I believe the key to weight management is a balance of what I like to call ""clean eating"" and moderate activity, which does not mean you have to cut our rice and white potatoes (I have lost and kept off over 80 pounds eating these things) from your diet nor spend 2 hours in a gym every day. The only benefit I get out of books such as this are new food lists that give new ideas for meals and a different perspective on portion control, which are good tools."
4,Buy the book!,"I have always been pessimistic about diet books. The public is bombarded with so many diets each year. I turned 40 quit smoking and got remarried in the space of 3 years. I put on 20 pounds. After jogging and exercising in many ways I decided to address my diet. THIS BOOK IS GREAT! Ok, it gets a little preachy about the size of the plate and doesn't speak much to the neccessity of physical activity. What this book does do is point out HOW MUCH SUGAR AND FAT WE ALL EAT. I had no idea. I lost 5 pounds in the first 7 days.Today is day 10. I will weigh myself tomorrow and start wave 2. The recipies are tasty. You can follow the easy tips and switch off to meals you like better or ones that are easy to prepare. No fancy ingredients, everything is at your local market.If this book does anything it will teach you that food can be tasty without the fat and sugar. I feel better knowing that I really do have control!"
5,What a great diet!!,"I absolutely love this diet, this is the first diet that I am not hungry on and do not feel like I am depriving myself, and it really helps with cravings just like she says it will. The only problem, which isn't really a problem at all if you can afford it, is that it can be expensive to buy all the ingredients if you follow her recipies and meal plans step by step, but it was the best way for me to loose weight. I've lost 9 lbs on it, and going for another 11. I would definately recommend this book & the diet."
4,Sonoma Diet Book review,"This book is great if you like more flavorful food. There are no gimmicks with this diet. You do have to follow the plan, but its more of a lifestyle change than anything. Even if you don't want to follow the ""waves"" plan, you can adapt the diet to your current eating habits. There are great recipes included and the foods reccomended sound yummy!"
4,GREAT BOOK,"I love this book. Lots of different and interesting, healthy tasty recipes. What more could you ask for! Great for those who want to lose weight and still have an excellent choice of recipes to work with."
2,The Gold Coast Cure INSTEAD!,"This book is very similar to the Gold Coast Cure(published earlier this year) If after reading the Sonoma diet you are frustrated with the ""waves"" and the advice regarding food combining and the measuring your plates, I highly recommend The Gold Coast Cure. On the Cure you eat great food from day 1---nogimmicks! I find the Gold Coast Cure much easier to follow ...I love the free workout DVD, and brand-name shopping guides too. Measuring your food is a pain in the *&^%, I just won't do it!"
3,A ....G L O R I F I E D....M E D I T E R R A N E A N.....D I E T,"Yes this book has recipes. Yes, this book has tips. But at its heart, it is just a re-telling of the Mediterranean diet...with a few new tips here and there. It's like buying a 100-room mansion when all you need is 5 or 6 rooms. My suggestion is to get a few books on the Mediterranean diet (including this one), from the library -- and save your money for high-quality organic vegetables!"
3,Just Another Diet Book,"I bought this book a couple of weeks ago. The cover is beautiful and enticing. Some of the information is helpful, such as the list of 10 power foods. The rest of it is pretty much what I have read in other diet books and a good bit of it is what I was taught by my nutritionist. I mainly wanted it for the recipes but found that most of them do not suit me for one reason or another. One of the main reasons some of them don't suit me is because they are for 10 or 12 servings. I'm single, live alone, cook only for myself. I don't eat fish or seafood so those recipes are useless for me and I'm not going to cook anything in parchment paper. So, this book resides on my bookshelves. Another $20+ wasted!"
1,The most unrealistic diet book ever,"This is a starvation diet. Very low in calories for the first 10 days. Of course you'll lose weight. Her suggestion for when you have sweet cravings? ""Don't eat them"". At least the South Beach author had you eating diet jello to quench your fruit cravings, sugar free popsicles and fudgesicles for your sweet cravings.Why is a tablespoon of heavy cream allowed for coffee but not for tea? A snack for women - 14 peanuts. Breakfast? High fiber cereal with non-fat milk. That'll keep you full for about 2 hours. What then? Eat lunch at 9am?The only thing good about this book are the recipes. They sound good. It also has nutritionally sound advice. But that's about it."
2,Sonoma Diet - smoke and mirrors?,"My girlfriend and I decided to try this diet together, but after looking it over, she came up with the above description. Basically, it's much ado about nothing; it's a difficult diet to keep, with much time required for preparing the food and suggestions like ""use a smaller plate."" The hook is that you can have wine, but essentially, there's nothing new here."
2,Fad diet that's likely to get you fat,"This diet is for people who want to gain weight. Why? Because you're likely to over-do the nuts and fruits and olives and wine and all. If you want to lose wait, start with walking: that's what people in the Mediterranean do; they walk a lot. Their diets serve their lifestyle, rather than the other way around. This isn't a bad diet per se, but without physical exertion as a prerequisite, it is meaningless."
3,Mediterranean meets the French Woman,"I liken the Sonoma Diet to ""French Women"" with a bit more explanation and a lot more recipes. The recipes section comprises almost two-thirds of the book and I see this as a confirmation that the `science' behind eating well shouldn't be that hard. The author offers the same common sense that most nutritionists have been offering for years: eat naturally healthy foods in reasonable proportions and stay relatively active. Not much of a secret but not very sexy either.There are plenty of meal plans and a list of ten `power foods.' The recipes look tasty and fairly easy to make.Should be a hit if you're looking for more daily help with recipes and planning than you get from some other books."
1,Not compatible with OS X 10.4 or higher.,"I got this product from a friend of mine with a legendary Apple IIgs keyboard. Unfortunately, it didn't work with my Intel-based MacBook running Leopard. I tried Griffin Tech's driver downloaded from their website, but it didn't support Intel Macs. Later, I found a note on Griffin's product page saying ""Mac: Mac OS 9.1 or greater, Mac OS 10.3.9 or older, USB port,"" which means it doesn't support Leopard. I tried to contact Griffin Tech, but iMate was not in their support list. So, the bottom line is that iMate is completely useless if you have an Intel Mac."
4,Easy to use product that's hard to find other places,"I was overjoyed to find this product so that we could use some old Alphasmart 2000s at my school with students. I've used these in the past and they weren't really durable for repeated use year after year by different students. However, they have been very difficult to find and are the only thing that works with Alphasmarts that don't have USB cables. They are very easy to use, just simply plug the appropriate ends in (you need to have the Mac Y cable that comes with the Alphasmart 2000). These worked fine with the PC, but I've used them in the past with Macs also. Had a great experience with the company that sold them so no complaints about them. I will probably order more as I fear that they won't be around much longer, and this is the only place I've found them so far."
4,ASE good but getting older,The book is older and info is alittle outdated. No x1 or advanced L1. James Hughes has retired. What we need is a newer version here.
4,Good Book,"I have read many books throughout my life, but this by far has been the greatest and most helpful book I have EVER read. Mere words in this review can not begin to explain how immensely this book has affected my academic career. In high school, when I took the pre-SAT for the first time, I got a 340 on the verbal. YES, that's right! a 340! Since English is not my first language, my vocabulary was EXTREMELY limited. My goal was improvement, but knowing that I had read very little English when I was young, I had to figure out a QUICK way to raise my score. After learning the words in this book, in a very twisted way I have yet to completely understand, my writing ability also dramatically improved. In conclusion, you are a COMPLETE FOOL if you take the SAT or the GRE without first extensively studying this book. Your future is very important, don't risk it. --This text refers to the Paperback edition."
1,BAD BAD BAD,"Yeah, this book mught be useful if you have the vocabulary of a paper cup. I genuinely couldn't believe the words in this thing. Who is this for? Eleven-year olds? Seriously-AVOID."
2,Not what expected,"This order was not what I expected at all. The listing does not clearly state how many shoes you get. I agree with the comment above, I was expecting 16 horseshoes for the cost. Contacted the seller and sorry to say, not satisfied. Horseshoes themselves were in ok condition. Unhappy! I will find someone else willing to give me more shoes."
4,Great Days with Great Lives,"Charles Swindoll has done it again! This is a great book which includes a short scripture reading and a one-page devotional. I'm about to finish week 5 (there are 365 devotionals) and I am learning so much about Joseph and how he can affect my life. Moses is next! Charles has the ability to bring out so much thoughtful insight in a few well-chosen words. As with all of his other books I have read, it is almost like he is in the room talking to you."
2,A critique.,"This is not a review of this book, that has already been done.I like novels based on historical facts and happenings, especially those events on the plains in the mid to late 1800's.This novel is based on a number of historical events, but it is disjointed and there are too many characters who are scattered everywhere.I much prefer novels by Elmer Kelton and Larry McMurtry."
1,Sorry I bought it.,Didn't live up to title/ write up. Pictures are very disappointing. Try to check out a copy from the library to review before buying.
3,Possesion by quite a sedate demon,"Vasary puts in a proficient performance in the recording of the Paganini variations (with the LSO conducted by Yuri Ahronovitch). I feel that although there are some nice touches, the performance lacks the demonic passion that is present in the most exciting performances of these variations on a theme of a man suspected, in his time, of being the devil himself. Perhaps a live performance is needed to inspire the energy of an epic battle between good and evil represented in this work.The solo pieces (Corelli variations and Preludes) performed by Lazar Berman, are a little more sparkling, and are a nice inclusion."
1,Don't Bother,"This ""book"" is a spiral bound collection of photo-copied pages.I bought this book expecting to learn how to build a case that will protect my guitar. Most of this book explains how to build the cheap cardboard cases you can buy anywhere. In the small section devoted to heavy duty construction he shows you how to build a box. I already knew how to do that.This author also has a ""book"" about building an archtop guitar. Those construction methods look like they would build a reasonably good case. I don't recomend that one either, but it is better than this."
2,Cold Spring Harbor played through a 2 way radio.,"I am rating this one star higher than my review for The Harbor Sessions because on this release you get a few outtakes from the Cold Spring Harbor era. Billy really sounds like an early 70s Paul McCartney on these rare tunes. Once again, the original Cold Spring Harbor LP has been poorly transferred to CD. Only this time, The songs are out of order, and the songs sound as if someone is pressing their finger on the lp and then letting go a bit, then repeating. A lot of pitch problems that make those tracks almost unplayable. All the Cold Spring Harbor tunes are at the wrong playing speed. There will probably never be any official releases of the rarities on this album, so for completist's sake, buy the album. But don't expect any high sonic quality anywhere on this release."
1,Terrible recording,The sound was of terrible quality. I listened to the CD for about 5 minutes and then threw it away.
5,Easy reader/ great aloud,"This is a book I try to read aloud to 1-3 graders every year. It is a treasure - great illustrations, amusing language, simple enough for early readers to read alone afterward! Kids love it."
1,Rather poor attempt at a Boxing top ten list compilation,"Some interesting lists mixed in with a lot of either fanboy or totally confusing lists of top fighters, etc. with little actual merit makes this a very hard book to get into."
2,its good for beginners,i dont have this ramp but my neighbor does. i have a homemade quaterpipe that is 4 feet in height and is about the same price in materials. the lauch ramp is really small and after awhile it gets pretty boring. im a skateboarder and usually go 2 da sk8prk which i find more fun then playing on a small lauch ramp. i dont think this ramp is worth the price at all. u can get ramp plans on websites for free and u can build a much better ramp for a cheeper price.
4,My first McTwist!,I learned my first McTwist off of this! I am now working on landing 720s and 1080s!
2,Ramp,Never were really able to use it - made well but the kids couldn't use it for anything other than bicycles & even that wasn't all that great.
5,aawesome,This ramp is tight you will skate it all day long. Only problem would have to be the ramp sliding.Besides that it is aawesome!
4,crazy,this toy is awsome and crazy but it sucks that u can only get it online PUT IT IN STORES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,coolness,its got evrything:sturdiness!!!!!its funtacular!!!!!will never get bored of it!!!!!lovin it!!!!!!sooooooooo cool!!!!anyone who likes to skate or scooter or bmx will luv it!!!
5,Gulliver's Travels,This was the only region 'All' of this DVD I could find anywhere in shops and online. Even though it is from Thailand it came up straight away in English and Thai subtitles underneath which are easy to turn off or switch to English. I'm very impressed with the quality of the DVD (it was wrapped brand new and is a legitimate copy). It was a great to watch a movie from my childhood again.Thanks!
3,Interesting Pang Bros. flick,"Don't buy this if you want to be scared. It's way more fairy tale and fantasy than outright horror. Sort of Pan's Labyrinth in a more Asian, CGI way. Also, if you have any hangups with the idea of abortion, stay far away from this. There are fetuses all over the place. Probably not a great date movie. Some scenes are visually stunning, but overall I guess I was disappointed. It's nothing you haven't seen before. The story is definitely something you have not seen put on screen before; I can guarantee that."
4,So far so good,"I bought this clipper set to replace my professional ones. They seem to do the trick, my only concern is that the blades are not steel but some sort of hard plastic. Not sure how much a replacement blade will be over time, but for now they work excellent!!!"
5,Love this Product!,I first purchased this item several years ago and loved it. Then I had trouble finding it in the retail stores. So glad I found it at Amazon.
2,Can't be in the same room as the bottle.,"If you have chemical sensitives to certain fragrances, stay away from this lotion. The scent is meant to be ""soothing,"" however, strong scents are not soothing to some people, and Unilever really ought to make an unscented version of this product.I have heard from the members of my family who are surrounded by a cloud of ""soothing lavender,"" that the moisturizer itself is great. That may be, but I need a bronchodilator."
3,"Wait, what?","Does it really say Grenada? It is Granada Theater. Therefore, the whole thing is wrong. That is kind of funny seeing as bands such as The Get Up Kids and The Anniversary call Lawrence, KS, home. So, would that make this a collector's item?"
2,"""Soft Rain"" is more for children.","I feel that ""Soft Rain"" doesn't depict the happenings of the Cherokee Trail of Tears very well. I guess I was looking for more detail. Don't buy this book unless it's for a child; this would be a good book for children."
2,Soft Rain,"Our class read Soft Rain when we were studying The Trail Of Tears, a forced march taken by the Cherokee people in 1838.In the beginning, a girl named Soft Rain lived peacefully with with her family and dog. Then, a horrible letter comes.Next, Soft Rain and Mama were taken away by soldiers and had to leave. They were kept in a stockade.Finally, they were sent west and reunited with their family. They started a new life.I thought the book was O.K. and had good details. I think people should read this book because it is suspenseful. It was a good book!"
2,what was that about?,"the first half was okay, the second dull. Well written, plaited plot, nobody to engage with and nothing to care about. Probably his worst book. I have read all the others and they all worked much better. It felt like three novellas that hadn't quite made it so he pasted them together. I am not saying don't buy it, it still rates as okay, but don't expect another end of the world blues."
1,What is all the hype about,"I have been reading science fiction for about 40 years and the best I can recall, this is one of my least favorite. Although some may like Jon Courtenay Grimwood's style of writing (if this is representative, not having read any before) I found it very hard to follow and very disjointed. Although the central idea of the novel is a good one, the author, in my opinion, seems to wander away from the story line to provide meaningless details that tend to confuse the reader. I have made it about half way through the novel but I am finding it very hard to complete."
1,mistaken identity,"I don't believe this is the Santana that we know. But a different artist from the Dominican Republic who happens to share the same last name as Carlos Santana the famous guitarist from Mexico. If you are searching for Carlos or his brother Jorge this is ""not"" what you want."
5,Helpful Guide to a 5,"I found this book very helpful for two reasons: the practice tests, and the terminology. If you know the terminology thoroughly, it will undoubtedly boost your score. The writing samples are decent, although its quite hard to capture that in a book. The practice tests are excellent, and as is implied by their name, the best way to prepare for the test. I reviewed with this book the week before the test and got a 5. I would recommend it as the best guide for this test."
1,!!DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!,"I love this song, and all the remixes, but this CD is terrible. It has ""copy control"" technology -- seems to be something new from the paranoid managers @ EMI Music. So, if you love to import your CDs onto your computer, like me, you can't do that with this CD. It won't play on your computer.I think this kind of technology is absolutely disgusting! I paid for the CD!! If I want to import the songs to my computer for my own use, that's my right! This new technology also goes against many court cases stating that consumers are allowed to make copies of their music/movies for their own personal use. This CD with it's ""copy control"" takes that right away from me.DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!"
1,Horrible cover versions,Occasionally these cover versions have some redeeming features. This has none. Avoid!
4,Useful product,"Used these to roll off the bottom end on a couple speakers that are rated to go down to 30 Hz, but which are too small to do so well.Solved the problem."
5,ALOT IN A SMALL PACKAGE,"THIS IS A SHORT BUT DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE 1972-73 SEASON FOR RANGERS FORWARD VIC HADFIELD. HE TAKES US ON A JOURNEY STARTING WITH TEAM CANADA, A GROUP OF SELECT ALL STARS FROM THE NHL, WHO WILL PLAY 8 EXHIBITION GAMES AGAINST THE AWESOME SOVIET TEAM. VIC TELLS US OF HIS TROUBLES WITH COACH HARRY SINDEN AND OF HIS LEAVING THE TEAM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 8 GAME SCHEDULE. HE THEN CONTINUES HIS ACCOUNT OF THE EXCITING BUT DISAPPOINTING SEASON ENDING LOSS TO CHICAGO IN THE STANLEY CUP SEMI-FINALS. I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK AND RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL HOCKEY FANS."
4,Good filter fit my car perfectly,"This is an install and forget product, it fits and seems to do its job well, no complaints here.Shipping is prompt and I got my rebate check quickly also."
4,Great Basic Book,"This book was great, especially for a beginner. It had step by step instructions and was very easy to follow. All of the material was very basic and gave a decent backgound of both JavaScript and HTML."
2,Not worth it,The books code uses depreciated HTML standards such as the font and center tags. The code is not well documented either. The JavaScript examples also lack good code structure. Some of the reference links in the book are dead. Aside from the many negative things about the book it has some good tips and the book layout is not to bad. The binding in the book is also decent. Each page is lamented so you will have extended life from it even if you spill stuff on it. Overall I would not recommend this book to a beginner because it will encourage them to use depreciated methods and coding.
5,Tom Yum soup mix... Yum!,Great transaction! Great Product! Amazing soup mix taste just like what the restaurants make. If you love Tom Yum soup and want to make it at home this is the key ingredient for the yummiest Tom Yum soup at home.
2,Lobo Spicy Tom Yum soup -SALTY!!!,"THE FLAVOR LACK AUTHENTICITY.... IT HINTS AT TOM-YOM BUT IT NEEDS TO BE ENHANCED WITH FRESH SPICES AND LEMON GRASS...ALSO, AND MOST IMPORTATLY, IT IS WAY TOO SALTY. I WILL NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT AGAIN"
1,I Felt Like A Dummy...,"My daughter is only 17 months old, but her doctor said that at her 18 month check up we will begin to talk about potty training. Since she is my first, I like to become somewhat knowledgable about different milestones she will be accomplishing so I set out to read some potty training books. Now, even though I am a first time mom, I am not stupid. This book made me feel just that. I felt like the author was talking to my 17 month old rather than her 28 year old mom. I was never really sure what points the author was trying to make and the ideas that were used weren't in my opinion good. Not to mention, this book was a little longer than I would've liked which might have also attributed to my dislike of this book. I found that Mommy I Have to Go Potty by Jan Faull and Parenting Guide to Toilet Training by Anne Kruger were much easier, shorter and more helpful then this book."
1,Dummies is accurate,"I couldn't get past the effort at clever jokes, witty remarks, and cute made-up phrases in this book on every single page. Tidbits of information clutter every page is a truly random fashion. Not only that, the real information is hidden somewhere in between. Also, is is really a topic that warrants such a thick and complicated book?"
2,Too Dumbed Down,"I was not able to finish reading this book due to the sweet, sappy words and references. I know that it is geared for ""dummies"", but I felt as if the language, such as ""doing the potty mambo"" was geared toward the 2 year old, not the parent reading the book. The information presented could be very useful if you can get through the book."
1,"Hey Dummies...stick to software & cooking, stay away from the potty","This book is just as useless as thePull-Ups Big Kid Central: Potty Training Success DVDthatis given away for free. You can't teach logic to a young toddler who hasn't fully gained control of their bladder. Bottom line, terrible twos or trying threes...the child will pee or poop when he/she is ready.We had the tearsheet on our fridge avidly awaiting each milestone our daughter reached in hopes of getting her there. Our greatest success came with a potty chair (against my own desire), a seat for the toilet, and potty books for her too read. She finally connected with a female character in one of the books and that sold her on the toilet. I assume that was it since shortly thereafter she used the potty on her own. She only called us over to brag about the achievement.Stick with books for your kids, not for you."
5,Great book,"Potty Training for Dummies is a great book if you're trying to potty train your little one. I am one of those people who like to have the actual written material in my hand but if you are one of those people who can read up on anything on the internet and be happy with it, you can find everything in this book on the web."
1,What's so funny?,"Ugh.. worst book ever. I wanted sensible, practical advice on how to begin toilet training my 2-year-old daughter. Instead, I got a book that belongs in the ""humor"" section! I think Dave Barry could have given better advice!"
2,ick,"I assumed this book was a general one on all types of potty training. In fact it is one-sided and just a manual on the intensive boot-camp style of training. I bought the Everything Potty Training Book at the same time and found it to be shorter, better written, and includes detailed instruction on four different methods."
4,I loved this book!,"I have to disagree with the other reviews wholeheartedly. I bought this book in preparation for training my son. He's my second, so I did manage to train his sister ""on my own,"" but she is a girl and he's a boy, and she's 5 1/2 years older, so it was a looong time ago. I have always dreaded potty training, but this book's ""cheerleading"" style has been so helpful and motivational. We are just at the beginning stages, but this is a great reference. The section on books, potty chairs and other helps is really great. This book is helpful to have on hand when your child is around 18 months so that you will be ready to start the preparation and pick up the cues, even though you will not likely start moving forward until the child is closer to 2 or 2 1/2."
3,"OK, but needs more organization","This book has a lot of super information in it, but what it lacks is organization. I kept thinking ""but didn't I already read that?"" because it repeats the information in several different ways and places. I would have rather had the book keep every thought, issue and subject distinguishable and not so cross-referenced. It made it difficult to look up an exact issue I was dealing with, and I would lose track of where I was. We have been working on potty training with our 2 1/2 year old for two months now, and I am now looking for a more substantial book. The one thing I have learned is PATIENCE."
3,I'M GLAD YOU LIKED IT,"Hi, this is David Hasselsmack. As you know, the past year has been a trying one for me and my family. I'm still in rehab and thanks to your thoughts and many prayers, things are really looking up. Seeing how my music has helped so many, it was only fitting that the music has helped me too. In group, we sing Everybody Sunshine to celebrate a breakthrough. Its rollicking production is an inspiration, even to my own ears. I must thank Adolf Eichmann for his stunning production values. And, as life has twists and turns, ""Do the Limbo Dance"" is also an emotional rollercoaster for me. Complex tempo changes and dynamite key changes are a metaphore for dealing with life's ambiguities. Anyway, this music has ment so much for me and it is deeply moving to see that it has moved you as well. Thank you and god bless. Btw, I give the CD 3 stars so as not to toot my own horn."
5,"From Baywatch to Dodgeball, this is a man for all times","I am now on my 14th copy of this incredible, wonderful, marvelous, sensuous, astonishing, mind-blowing, fantastic, prodigious, huge, phenomenal, stupefying, inconceivable, incroyable, unglaublich, glorious, ersatz, pleasant, insipid, tasty slab of scorching sonic ambrosia. Those who doubt the ascendancy of 'The Hoff' are truly the boorish offspring of feral land-trolls. The track ""Hot Shot City"" is particularly tempting."
5,Godlike...,"I don't know why most people make fun of this living legend. For me, David Hasselhoff is like many great things. A philospher, a poet, a shining example for the entire human race in fact he could well be the second coming of the Messiah.I have listened to his music year on year and yet still struggle to understand the complexities of his lyrics and find myself searching my own soul to find answers to the questions his songs pose for me.His angel like voice sooths me in any mood, and frequently puts me in the mood for love, physical love.David, you rock my world and I love you for the feelings you fill me with."
5,Searching for meaning - and finding it,"I just typed ""Hasselhoff"" into an online German-English translator, and you know what came up? ""Hasselhoff"". Not because there isn't a translation of some sort (I'm sure that there is), but, I believe, because the computer saw no need. Such is the extent of David's renown. ""Hasselhoff"" means ""Hasselhoff""; wherever you go, don't bother with a dictionary or phrasebook - just uttering that magic word will win you new friends.Even more interestingly, I split the word in two and tried again. ""Hassel"" drew a blank, I'm afraid. But ""Hoff""? That's right, ""Hope"". So when we talk about ""The Hoff"", we are really talking about ""The Hope"" - the hope that David brings, by virtue of his music, to those unfortunates who have yet to experience those heavenly melodies, profound lyrics, and pulsating beats.""Hot Shot City"" is particularly good."
5,Who's got good strong?,"When I listened to this CD my pants flew around the room and promptly landed in a position resembling that of either and aardvark or an oscelot I'm not sure which since I am not a zoologist. The genius that is David Hasselhoff makes me reign supreme and shout ""Robots soon will control us all."" Well back to the salt mines for me. Nothing can compare to these things."
5,The Majesty of Hasselhoff saved my marriage!,"5 days ago I listened to this CD for the first time and I've been in euphoria since. After finding out that he died I went to the local elementary school, acquired a small boy, and sacrificed him to hades in hopes of bringing him back to make another CD. My neighbor doesn't like Hasselhoff though and she called the police, I got arrested and my dog died after drinking the pool water since I couldn't clean it. David Hasselshlop saved my soul however.Hot Shot City is particularly good."
1,Oh please!!,"After reading the 100 plus reviews here, I think it's time someone outside the Hoff's family, or the people who work at his record company, had a say.This album is complete tripe. He can't sing or dance. Still, Germany owes a huge debt to this man. If it wasn't for him getting up on the Berlin wall to sing a song, it may have never been knocked down!"
1,Dan you are a spud!,"Following the review from Dan below i decided that i had to go out and buy this album. When i began to play the CD the quality of the first song surprised me. I was blown away by the fusion of a memorable drum track, great vocals from the man himself, and the mind bending lyrics which gave me a new perspective on life.However, after the high point of the first masterpiece the album goes downhill. The low point being 'Do the limbo dance' an immature attempt at a catchy pop number which makes me want to use this CD as a frisbee. The album never recovers from this outdated and pathetic track. The only light in this darkness is 'I Believe' the theme from baywatch which birngs back memories of the slow motion bouncing breasts of Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff showing off his manly hairy chest.Do not buy this CD, the only thing good about it is the cover."
1,No way,"You've got to be kidding me, you people actually bought this inane excess of luxury and laziness?"
5,"Have CD, now ... Hasselhoff ROCKS, that's it in a nutshell","Here's to an underrated musical talent, and here's to saying 'My old impression was wrong'. CD came and it sounds great. Chillin' out sipping some Californian Beaujolais, David Hasselhoff's booming tones filled the den. Some of the mellower songs, like ""Yesterday's Love"", deliver varied emotion, but ""It's 11 o'clock and we're ready to rock"" ... let's you know the rock anthem of the Northern hemisphere is upon you: ""Hot Shot City"". With the audio image of that chick in a red Ferrari burned through my ear, into my retina .. and then comes a chorus (which many find particularly good), letting you know all the fist-pumping splendor that music could be, should have always been ... and could be. Pick up this compilation of literally ageless music, you'll be amazed."
4,Worked well for me,"I haven't had any problems with my device, maybe mine is newer than the others that have been reviewed. Also, I do not have wireless access at home, I just use it at college and at other businesses with wi-fi. I have used it for hours at a time with no problems at all. I only sold it because I got a cell phone that can function as a wi-fi adapter. My only complaint with the Buffalo adapter is that it does stick out about 4 inches which can be awkward at school or at a restaurant table."
2,they look good,"you lose alot of torque which you need so badly.2nd the down pipe routes right under your oilpan instead of around the front like your stock setup is. I cant wait to get off road again and tear it out over a rock. I first bought the Banks torque tubes but the had metal shavings in the tubes and were not polished as they said they were so I sent back and had them replaced with another set which was worse than the 1st, they looked as if someone was drunk when they made them and dropped them. I still shoulda kept them and polished them and cleaned them out because the torque you lose from not having the back pressure you need is huge."
5,I like it,"I use it to cook fish and veggies on my grill. You just have to remember, the handle will get hot on the grill."
5,Cascade Climber,"Very accurate book about the Northern Cascade Range. This book will tell you all the main routes like a dummies guide would. If you want the real deal for climbing the cascades, then spend the money on Oregon High, for the really obscure routes that nobody has ever heard of. For 10 bucks, the Falcon Guides are bar none, ""the one""."
3,Not terribly useful.,"The route descriptions in this book are not very in-depth and the route illustrations that aren't photos are sort of useless. You get what you pay for, I guess."
3,Who buys collections?,"So, yet another collection of Teardrops classics hits the streets. But who buys them? This should actually be titled selection rather than collection & it's a bit eclectic too. Who needs a collection like this? I consider both this bands original albums as essential & both were well re-issued recently featuring almost their entire output generously spread over both discs. Surely more satisfying than owning less than half of their recorded work & not neccesarily their best. However, for those new to the band, it would probably serve well enough as an introduction & will surely leave the listener curious enough to hear more & will thus, go ahead & buy the original albums anyway. A great piece of marketing therefore so hats off to those poor souls at the record company desperate to make ends meet & who so obviously deserve our hard earned cash! BUY IT! DON'T BUY IT!"
1,Check the sprng carefully,"They put a right hand wind spring in a left hand wind box. Of course I didn't realize this until I got it mounted and wound (I noticed it wasn't getting longer as I wound it). So now I get to tear it all apart again, send it back wait for the new one tear it apart and put the new on. Thanks for wasting a couple of hours.So check the springs carefully when you get them to ensure you have the correct springs. It easy to do, I simply trusted them to put the correct spring in the box."
5,Solid Spring,"This is a good spring. Make sure you know if yours is a right hand wound, or left hand wound before you replace your spring. This thing is fun replacing, you have to be pretty strong to get 25-30 turns on this beast. Works well, no problems."
5,Spring,"Arived fast, as avertised, the spring I order is a little light fo my door, my fault, next time I will order a stronger spring, but is working fine"
3,Una buena recopilacion,"Sin duda uno de los mejores grupos españoles de los años 80. En este disco se recopilan la mayoria de sus mejores temas. Lástima que algunas de las versiones desmerezcan un poco respecto a las versiones originales. Tal es el caso de ""La estatua del jardin botanico"" o ""Escuela de calor"". De haber sido todo versiones originales este disco valdria sin duda 4 o 5 estrellas. Esta muy bien lo de experimentar, pero hay que andarse con ojo."
2,MADE IN MEXICO,"This is a MADE IN MEXICO filter. My past fleetguard filters with this part number were Made in USA. This ""Mexico"" filter is over 1 inch shorter. Do you realy want to trust your Diesel to a MEXICO filter. Also, the PICTURE in the ad shows the larger USA filter.The description also says it's the tall size. Waste of money since I wont use the filters I bought!"
4,Silly fun!,"This is a collection of music videos from King's X's first 3 albums. Most of the videos are silly or attempt to be profound, but still come off fun.For the most part, the video is good because you get to see and hear King's X.All of the songs, ""King"", ""Shot Of Love"", ""Over My Head"", ""Summerland"", ""It's Love"", and ""We Are Finding Who We Are"", are good choices from their albums.It is a kind of MTV for a band that never got the recognition that they deserved and therefore never got airplay.Still, it is a fun video for any fan."
5,Excellent! Awesome! Should be read by everyone interested..,"...in the future of the Church. Having interviewed over 300 young orthodox Catholics, Tim Drake provides compelling evidence that the Holy Spirit is still guiding the Church, and that we are now less than one generation away from a Catholic revival. This makes an ideal book for every Catholic -- whether lay, religious or clergy -- interested in the future of the Church."
2,A rose by any other name.... is LUNCH.,What can one say about an author who thinks that Sappho was a man?
4,Great read,The funniest book no one's ever read. Welcome to the demented mind of Shawn Deena. If you bought copy you make his day.
5,Pleased with this product,"What a great cookbook! It not only uses natural food products, which is the way I prefer cooking, but I enjoy reading the Biblical aspect it provides too. Thanks!"
5,A cookbook you can read like a novel,Great recipes with culture and history lessons mixed in. The recipes are easy to follow and taste delicious. Very well written.
5,excellent condition/good recipes,"A friend of mine has this cookbook and I wanted to get one for myself. It has some really simple and delicious recipes. I'm glad I didn't spend more money on a brand new one and decided to go with a used one. The book arrived in excellent condition. There is a dedication written on the inside of the cover page. Other than that, it looks like brand new."
3,Yep,I like it i think it is very very nice you will like it too if you buy it because it will help you to learn a lot when you want to get smarter than friend
5,You'll never pick up another role-playing system.,"I got into Hero with the release of D&D4.; I didn't feel like spending another $4000+ on new D&D; books, so I switched and I've never looked back. The Hero System, and its supplements, supply you with all the tools to run a game in any genre: fantasy, superhero, pulp, and sci-fi, just to name a few. Another advantage is that each new edition tells you how to convert previous editions to the new rules, so no planned obsolescence.The books are thoroughly researched and perfectly-balanced, reducing any conceivable power or character ability to a detailed and comprehensive numerical formula. Though a bit math-intensive, the system eliminates min-maxing and power gaming, and the Hero Designer software does all the math for you.Oh, and the main thing that this system has that other systems don't: a comprehensive table of contents and index in every book."
1,what?,"Why on earth is an item like this for sale through amazon? This is political, religious opinionated junk. Keep this kinda stuff off of amazon."
5,Wonderful,"Wonderful Reading!!! I wish there was something on how they picked the actors, and who else was considered for the parts."
4,By reading the previews I don't think I need to buy the book...,"I think people need to have a little more of tact and consideration when writing a review. There are some people out there that basically tell the whole story including ""quotes"" and everything. Come on, give me a brake and start just focusing on writing about how good the book is and not rewriting the story."
1,Brokeback mountain,Was expecting an actual book. Nothing in the ad would lead you to believe this is just a short story. Really dissapointed!!! Thought I was buying an actual book....
1,Audibles.com is a Scam,"I purchased and downloaded this book, because audibles.com promised I would have an mp3 file that can be uploaded to my mp3 player. No way! Finally, after much effort, I learned from their tech support that the company's promise was a lie. The file I downloaded cannot be played on my mp3 player. I still have not heard the book, so I cannot comment on the content."
1,Brokeback Mountain,"I was not impressed or especially moved by this short story, primarily because the characters fell flat. One's time and money would be better spent on the movie inspired by this book. The movie breathed life into these characters in a way that the book never achieved."
1,Definitely did NOT live up to the hype....,"Proulx tried to capture two complex characters and a complicated story in a short story. Maybe if she chose to make this a novella, or a full-length novel, she could have written something that lived up to its reputation. As it stands, the characters are less than compelling. Hopefully, the movie captured what the book failed to."
2,Not really...,"I read the book last night. Sorry, it was not as moving and captivating as some reviewers here have portrayed it. Thank God the movie is using two good looking guys to play the parts. The descriptions in the book of a short guy with a ponch and a tall bow-legged guy with a gap in his teeth made me think of two hillbillies not two cowboys.The story line was pretty predictable. If you haven't read the book, skip it and see the movie."
1,"Honestly, no comment.","I suddenly grew interest in seeing the movie so I thought I catch myself up and read the book. Unfortunately, the book was so painful to read I had to toss it aside - literally. I mean, the book has a lot of grammatical errors, and it's poorly written. I'm sure this book could've been a lot better if it was written more professionally. I hope the movie will be a lot better than this. The book was very disappointing."
3,Brokeback Hardback,"The story is Five Stars. By it's nature a short story, however, doesn't make much of a ""book"". The volume is tiny and appears to have been printed ""in haste."" It will none the less be cherished by me and I am otherwise proud to send benefit and thanks to Ms. Proulx with the purchase."
1,Brokeback Mountain,This was a very abbreiviated version of the movie. It took about 10 minutes to read the entire book and it was expensive. I tried to cancal the order even befoe I started reading it when I realized how many pages there were and I wasn't able to.
5,Great story and essay's for a sweet short story,I really enjoyed reading what it took for this wonderful short story to be turned into a movie. Annie Proulx's kind thoughtful words were translated beautifully into the screenplay. I read this book before the Oscar's and its pretty easy to see why this story won an award for best adaptaion into a screen play.
3,brokeback mountain book and cd,enjoyed the book. went very much with the way it was used for the movie...did not realize however it was just a novellette and in paperback. The soundtrack however is wonderful.
2,Haven't seen the movie,"All the other reviewers seem to have seen the movie first.I have yet to see it. At this point, all I can say is that if they turned this into a good movie, which apparently they have, then they certainly deserve the Oscar for Screenplay. I was not at all impressed by the story. I would not be interested in seeing the movie except to see how they turned this sow's ear into a silk purse."
3,Good short book,I was in the bookstore yesterday and saw the book advertised on a stand and was surprised by how thin it was (I didn't know it was a short story). I read it right then and there on a comfy chair in my book store within 40 minutes. I felt like I was right there in Wyoming watching it all happen. The way the characters were described in the book (physically) though was nothing like the film actors
2,Still Don't Get It...,"I just don't. I viewed the film PRIOR to reading the novelette, and the script was a near word-for-word image of the book. An Ang Lee fan, I expected him to convey the ""love"" more to me (all I got was beautiful landscapes and what should have been a good ol' buddy relationship). I thought the book may transfer more of the feeling Mr. Lee intended, and in my opinion, it did not. In fact, without the visual, the story seemed even more improbable that these two men fall hopelessly in love-for-life. My bottom line: If you've seen the film, you've already read the novelette."
2,I expected a book,"Buyer beware, I guess. I expected a full-length book (based on a two hour movie), but received a short magazine article."
3,"Great story, much too short","I would have easily given this a full 5 stars. However, I thought that, if you really wanted to spend the money, to spend it on the film. Seriously. This story is the mere backbone of the whole essence of the Brokeback Mountain movie. I liked it, however I thought it was much too short."
4,Brokeback Mountain,"When I read this book years ago, the sparseness of the story just seemed to rip more gaping holes in my already aching heart! For such a short story it tells such a huge tale of regret and love lost. Just like the best special effects in a movie are the ones you don't even know are there, in this book it's the dialogue that is never said, the intentions that are never acted upon, and the words that only seem to exist between the lines that make this such a haunting, impactful, heart-wrenching story."
3,"Awesome story, but...","First things first. Annie Proulx' short story Brokeback Mountain is absolutely awesome. So much has been written about it, I don't think I'll have to go into detail.However this version of it provides horrible value for money compared to other alternatives.For just 1$ more, you can get the ""From Story to Screenplay"" book, which not only includes this story but also the published screenplay to the movie AND three interesting essays by Proulx, Ossana, and MCMurtry.The second alternative, also just a measly dollar more expensive, is Annie Proulx' ""Close Range: Wyoming Stories"", which also includes this story and 10 more short stories by Proulx.I'd only recommend this item to collectors who want all merchandise from the movie. Everyone else is better served with the alternatives I mentioned, IMHO."
5,A great work,"Annie Proulx has done an amazing job with writing this book. the detail is so rich and i feel like im actually on the field with jack and ennis. i cant wait for the adaptation of the film and im sure it will be nominated for an oscar. but before an oscar, there has to be a good foundation and annie proulx has done just that"
3,Review of Brokeback Mountain Book,"I thought the book was good, although I think it was over priced for it's size (53 pages)."
3,water damage,The book was listed in good condition but on the inside of cover had mildew from water damage. I wasnt very pleased with this item.
4,Adelightful first novel that weaves the past a present toget,"I found this a very clever book , that weaves the past and present together . The remmbrance of an unusual childhood and how we come to perceive the world through many experienes, is revealed through snpshots of his life. I loved the use of poetry and almost magical quality the writer imparts to his rembering his childhood as an older person."
5,Don't run....,"Dear Readers,I am a graduate of this book as well as a former client of the Author.I was at my very end, when we crossed paths. I was broken and out of all hope. My horrific past had finally caught up with me. With a vengence! I too was afraid to trust yet another ""self help"" book. That's not what this is. This has a way. The techniques can be hard and painful. By that I mean no one likes to face things. Who we really are,what we think,why we act the way we do. This book is an incredible healing tool. Those who are looking for hope, look here. Face the pain, face the shame, face the fear. You aren't doing it alone. Let God do his perfect work my friends. At the end is that Peace and Happiness you longed for. Truth is, it was there all along. But you won't know that till you get YOUR healing. As for the negative comment I saw on here, running will get you nowhere. My best to you all.Kim Wohlert"
5,One of the best books I have ever read,"I have read Ed's book...I WILL GIVE YOU REST, at least 3 times. I have also had intensive counselling from him on 2 different occasions. As a mature Christian, and as an avid book reader, I can honestly say that this book, and this man have changed my life for the better. Also, I am an ordained minister, and know enough about the Word of God, to have some authority on the subject matter. I very strongly encourage every Christian to obtain a copy of Eds' book. Read it slowly, and with prayer, and I am certain you will never be the same again. God has blessed the Church with this man and his God given revelation on subject matter that is rarely taught in churches or bible studies around the world. I give this book more than 5 thumbs up. It will be an investment that will reap you rewards for eternity."
5,Great Book!!!,This is an Awesome book that my sis recommended to me. I read it a couple of times and would def recommend it to anyone!
1,"CAUTION: Christians, Beware Of False Prophets","I was very attracted to the message of healing in this book as were the others who have written reviews. However, I went a step further than the other reviewers and scheduled a week (15 hours) of intensive counseling with the author at his home in Idaho. During the third day of counseling is when I finally discovered that the author is not as he has portrayed himself in his book. The TRUTH is that he is extremely critical of Christian pastors and is very supportive of and practices modern psychoanalysis. He is obviously very Freudian in his thinking and counseling methods. He is very sly in both his book and in his personal counseling. Christians, beware of FALSE PROPHETS! I got very close to this false prophet and it caused me to quickly run in the opposite direction as soon as I realized what he truly was. Seek help and counseling from your church family and pastor. Do not be deceived and victimized by this false prophet as I was."
5,Best of Books,"The books ranks among the best I have read in my life. Next to the Bible itself, it may be the best. I would highly recommend to others."
4,May save me a lot of paint,"I like the book. One (typical) page of this book shows color swatches of raw sienna mixed with 12 other colors. Each color mixture is tinted and tinted more. One would think that a skilled artist should have mastery of his/her colors --so that this book really isn't needed. Maybe so. On the other hand, it might be nice to buy two copies and mount the pages for easier reference."
3,Would be great but...,"This little book would be invaluable except for the fact that the colors are from the Daler-Rowney range of oil paints, which is a student grade brand. Many of the colors are not even offered by the better paint manufacturers, or if they are it is under different names, and the author does not address this issue. I want to buy paints of much better quality, which makes using the book much less straight forward. Also, the author discusses color only, but not such important issues as the type of binder, concentration of pigment, etc. I feel that the book was written at least partly to push Daler-Rowney paints, and is meant to be used mainly by students and not professional artists."
4,Great Book,"Overall this is a great book, with easy to understand directions, maps, elevation profiles, etc. The trails are all organized in an extremely useful way, and the writing style is very approachable.My only gripe, and the reason it's 4 stars instead of 5, is that some trails are missing. If you go to the National Park Service website, you can get maps which are more comprehensive and show where multiple trails mentioned in the book intersect - for even longer, more interesting hikes.But that said, this book is a great entry-point, to introduce you to an area and provide some great insight into the terrain. From there, a little online research only adds to the experience."
5,No BS and great battery life,"This phone is the one I rely on to do what a phone does... make calls and retrieve my voice mail. The battery life is awesome, the phone is sturdy and very well made, and the flashlight and alarm clock come in very handy! I love this phone. Oh, and I am addicted to the little Snake game. But this phone isn't about extras, it's about phone calls. I can go a looong time without having to recharge it, too."
5,Like a dream,"I do not know fluent Vietnamese, or really any for that matter. The English translations are so florid and calming that I can only imagine that the poerty must be majestic when spoken in Vietnamese. The poems are such a powerful introspective look into the hear and mind of a very talented soulful poet. I am not a large fan of poetry, but this is just an amazing poetic compilation."
5,Vietnamese Cultural Revival--in the USA,"Recognizing that Southeast Asian youth are quickly forgetting the lessons of traditional culture, war and the refugee experience, Le Pham eloquently recounts in poetry her personal experience. Printed in both Vietnamese and English, Le records the essential emotional experience. Nostalgic homeland and savage high seas memories are carefully detailed in a wonderful conciseness only possible in poetry. A must read for social science teachers and Vietnamese youth."
5,Great buy,"This was the best deal I found on the internet. The tubs are great, and are just like the ones at the theater!!"
3,Too much detail obscures the lessons,"A theme of this book is that the history of radio transmission privilege teaches about Internet issues. Another is that media monopolies are pertinent for civil liberties. Both are worth paying attention to.However, excessive detail about the personalities and wrangles of otherwise-forgotten British entrepreneurs makes it unnecessarily difficult for readers to discern and judge the arguments for and against central control of media and bandwidth. Had the book been 80% as long as it is, it would have been much better."
4,Fresh Ideas for Out Dated Jewels,"Flea Market Jewelry has some innovative ideas for turning those old costume jewelry parts into something you will actually wear and use. There's also an Artist's Gallery with unique contributions from other artists.If you like buying bits and pieces or if you have inherited outdated costume jewelry and want some inspiring new ideas to try, this may be the book for you!"
3,Interesting Attempt,"Okay, it's not great. It's not even very good. But, it is interesting, and I like it.It's nearly impossible to recreate the Alan Parsons sound, and this recording doesn't get close. But, it's really okay. And, it's interesting to hear another version of these songs, even if they're attempts that fall far short of the originals.Bottom line - I'm glad I got the cd, and it's one I'll listen to on occasion....but not nearly as frequently as the originals!"
1,Too much fluff,"I bought the book with much hope... yet I was unhappy with it. I am looking for new, improved ways to design and implement programs using C++, and sadly this book doesn't offer much help in that direction.The book is a bit silver-bulletish: pompous terms, academic ""serious"" style, predictions, they're all there. Yet the practical examples the authors give are not very conclusive.The book is too long. A very hard, and not much rewarding, read. And the forward references are really annoying. Practically the first half of the book keeps saying that the details about X, or even the full definition of X, will be found in a subsequent chapter...Too hard to read, too little outcome for me as a reader. The information is there but it's drawned in mere fluff."
4,An advanced work on Code Generation,This is a solid book of the theory behind code generation. Definitely worth the look if you are interested in extending your build process with code generation or are looking at template drive programming.
5,Awsome pedal...but why on amazon.com?,"Ok, first of all why would they sell a guitar pedal on amazon?Anyway,this is an amazing pedal used by Kurt Cobain. It has only a depth switch and a rate nob but you can get many unique sounds from it! Turn the depth nob up and the rate nob all the way to the right and you get this crazy wrable sound. Or you can turn the switch down and the nob at about 10 'o clock to get a nice watery sound.I HIGHLY recommend this pedal!"
4,They're bulbs alright,"I only needed to replace one bulb on my car, but at such a cheap price for a ten-pack, how could I resist? I've only had one of these bulbs in my car for a couple of days now, but it seems to work just fine. With nine spare bulbs handy, I don't really care if they end up burning out easily.My only complaint is that Amazon placed the product in a shipping container which is literally 50x larger than the product. That's a tad excessive, even for glass bulbs which need some space for cushioning in the box. It's just wasteful."
5,Awesome Bulbs @ incredible price.,I bought these for my Toyota Highlander and they work great. I bought these same bulbs from Walmart for over $5/pair. A pack of 10 bulbs for only $6.29 and they are MADE IN JAPAN. What an incredible price for this many bulbs.
4,Excellent,"A very nice collection of basic swing and big band songs. Most of these songs have been performed by many different artists, and this album provides a CD full of trumpets and kicky beats. The songs make you imagine a swing scene like that in ""A League of Their Own"""
5,My 9-year-old loves it,"I have a 9-year-old who wants to be an artist when she grows up, and she loves this book. The art projects we've tried have come out great."
3,Another quick read,"This book isn't my favorite. I kinda got bored with it toward the end. I found it to be very predictable. I think that's because I read way too much in general so it takes a lot to surprise me. It's good if you want something short to read. It didn't grab me like Silken Web and Where there's smoke did, but I don't regret reading it."
4,"Easy read, very romantic.","The synopsis is misleading because they never find her MIA husband, they just find resolution. Please make that correction.The book reads quickly, but is fairly monotonous. It does have some excitement and of course a happy ending."
5,luvin it!,"i realy loved this book..it was the first romance book i've read and the best so far(it hasn't been long since i started, hehe). i seriously wasn't able to put it down! after starting to read it at 10pm and all through the night untill the school started and then some more at school untill i was done...thats how great it was. lol...its one of the disadvantages of reading books i have..not being able to go to sleep sence i'd be reading it all night and the next day. hehe. it realy is a good book...nicoles character was funny and it was amazing how a guy could adore a girl THAT much. :-) it makes u set ur expectations WAY high on ur ideal husband. well...i guess all romance books do. *jelena*"
4,great book!,I really enjoyed this book a lot. You really learn to love the characters and the plot. I even found myself with tears in my eyes at some of the more emotional parts!
5,Tomorrow's Promise,"What an exceptional book! I truly loved it! It really moved me with the war and everything going on in Iraq these days. Keely Preston being married for 12 years, not knowing if her husband is dead or alive, a helicopter pilot with the armed forces. He is MIA and she works on this committe called PROOF. She is trying to let congress know too keep the MIA's and the money to their families continuing until they find out legally if they are dead. That's when she meets up with Dax a congressman, he helps her and supports her and they both fall in love.One of Sandra Brown's awesome books! Great read for anytime."
3,"Passionate, bittersweet melodrama","Keeley was married just three weeks before her husband Mark's helicopter was shot down in Vietnam and he was classified as an MIA 12 years earlier. She has remained faithful over the years. As she prepares to meet with Congress to fight for the right to maintain his MIA status to continue receiving his military salary which pays for the care of his elderly parents, she meets and falls for a sexy congressman. As she struggles with the guilt to love on without Mark and forge a new relationship with Dax, she finds herself in a catch 22 when there is a possibility that Mark is among the group of POW's that have emerged out of the jungle.Because it was written early in Brown's career, character development takes a backseat to the romance itself. But this, emotional drama plays out like a well-scripted movie of the week, and has readers wondering who they will root for."
4,Spend 12 years of youth waiting for a dead husband.,"Love brings you happinese or grief? Tomorrow's Promise by Sandra Brown is one of the good books I've ever read. I like it because it keeps me to read on to find out what happen to Keely at the last. Keely has waited for her husband to come back for 12 years without knowing whether she's a widow or still married. After 12 years of waiting, she meets another man she loves. She doesn't know what to do. What would happen if she goes together with the man she loves now and her husband if her husband comes back in one day. This keeps bothering Keely of what she do is right for her. It's also why I want to read on to find out the answers to Keely's questions. It's an interesting book to read."
3,Great Reissue,This is one of Sandra Brown best of the reissue. Even though predictable you will know what happens in the novel. You will love it anyway. Make it part of your library.
3,eh,"Technicly and sonicly, this CD is great, but musically I find it empty. By comparison, the California Guitar Trio is much more interesting."
4,Very Nice,"As a big fan of the many ""Top such and such sopranos"" type CDs, I found this to be one of the best yet. It exemplifies the highlights of each sopranos career...and leaves you with a great impression of them all.Also, the CD is quite enjoyable, for it varies from heavy, matured sopranos..to those younger, more glittering and creamy. I found this to truly be money well spent, for it a wonderful addition to my ""opera hits"" collection. One point off for the rather stereotypical selection fo arias and such ...otherwise...Enjoy!"
3,One definitive volume explains it all!,"Yup. You guessed it. All blank pages. If you think this idea is funny, you know who you are, so buy it.If you don't think it's funny, don't complain. Just don't buy it.Personally, I think it's worth a few laughs as a gift for that disgusted friend recovering from a breakup. Lighten-up and enjoy a little silliness!"
3,Funny you should ask,But as reviews go lets just say I am blank or speechless as to the content not contained by this publication.
5,Amazingly Accurate!!!,'Everything Men Know About Women' had be turning every single page! I could not put it down until the very last page. All I can say is that every tidbit of information that the author described was right on the mark! Even during my studies in psychology could not have been more accurate. Thanks Dr. Francis for helping me fully understand more about what I don't know about women.
5,The truth,This is g great gift for a laughter. But please notice the size - about half the size of A4 paper makes it more like a notebook rather than a book.Overall it's a great gift.
3,"A great joke, just not what I expected as a book.","The copy of this book I received is awesome. It is intentionally blank, which is hilarious, but it isn't very ""book like"". If I were to take this book seriously I'd want it to look like a book that could be on this topic. Something that was at least 300 pages long, larger in size, and didn't resemble a pocket guide.This part more pertains to my edition of it, but it's cover is much different than what the photo looks like. I did buy it used and not directly from Amazon, but the cover doesn't look as good.Still, all in all it's a fantastic joke in my opinion, I just with the publisher had committed to it more."
4,Clever and Totally Blank,"Given that you can buy this book used for .01 it is a great gag gift. Yes, it is totally blank and good for Alan Francis for coming up with such a clever idea. That's what you're paying for."
3,Simply a Notebook with a Title,"If you are bored of buying a notebook without a title, this book is just the thing you need. The price of the book is within the range of a 60-sheet notebook, so I guess it is worth the buy with the added humor. I only gave the book 3 stars since the pages are not lined. Perhaps the author would consider to produce a second edition with lines; this will make the book (or notebook) more useful.On a more serious review, the book represents the author's own view of how much he knows about women; a total blank mind."
5,I will never know who Dilia Morales is..,"Back in 1991 I was living in Marshall MN, and came to this library, found the book Everything Men Know About Women and thought, maybe I can learn something reading it; when I saw the blank pages I went to the customer service desk and asked for a ""good book"", thinking that the one I grabbed was wrongly delivered; I had only lived in USA for about six months and was looking for ways to learn english. Je je; the customer service lady was kind enogh to explain that the whole book was a joke. I hardly understood. Today I bought the ""book"" in Kindle Amazon knowing what really is; is the perfect truth, I will never know what the woman is, I don't know who my two daugthers are, I have been living with Dilia for almost 25 years and can not say I know her; my mom, my friends and even some lovers, (I am not proud of it) I could never tell who they are."
2,This book is full of blank pages,"Literally. I think potential buyers deserve to know what they're getting. I get the cute, roll-your-eyes humor (""Yeah yeah, men don't know anything about women"").It'll probably make a cute gift (like ""Haha, OK, hookay, very funny, now let me just put this book in the shelf to gather dust"").The waste of trees (120 pages) is quite regrettable, though. We get that men don't get women already. On the other hand, maybe men REALLY don't get women, because I can't ""get"" that any person will buy something like this.That said, I think Alan Francis is a genius. The fact that she recognizes this opportunity and capitalize on it--that's something everybody can learn from--so extra one star for this book."
1,Do you want to pay for a book of blank pages?,"Literrally, this is a book of blank pages. There is nothing written on it. This book might or might not suit the topic (""Everything Men Know About Women""), depend on your own opinion. I might like it if it is a joke from a friend, but not from an author whom is claimed to be a doctor.When I ordered the book on line, I wanted to read a book of well-thought opinions/comments. I am not happy with what I got. However, guess I would keep it for reminding myself the lesson learned from Dr. Alan Francis and ""everything men know about women"""
1,Disrespect!!,"How disrespectful. What a disgrace to women! What a waste of time, energy, space, and love! If anyone thinks this is reasonable, may God have mercy on you. The main reson men don't understand women, is women lie about themselves, to themselves, and to their husbands! I hope and pray not one more copy is sold! Please women, be a helpmeet, not a hinderance! Sincerely,a woman of God!"
3,It's just common sense,"A lot of this book takes the potential home buyer through the decision of buying a home. Like, are you ready? Do you have enough money? Or, telling you to make sure you know where you want to buy. Most people who purchase a book to help them navigate the home purchasing market already know if they're ready to buy and where they want to buy a home.Although the book gives you information about the process of purchasing a home, it's really not necessary. As long as you use a reputable real estate agency, they'll walk you through the entire process.Mostly, it's a simplified informational book about purchasing a home in California, that might be useful to some young novice home buyers."
4,Well-written and easy to understand,"Like other Nolo Press books, this book is well-written, easy to understand, and very comprehensive. I think the best audience for this book is a first-time buyer in California as it does cover some of the idiosyncracies of our market (pricing, special forms, disclosure requirements)in a straightforward manner. For the more experienced buyer it is likely too basic.Overall, a good present for that first time buyer on your list!"
4,How to buy a house. . .anywhere,"I think this is a first-rate book about buying a home, but not necesarily in California. The information is excellent regarding the best practices for home buying anywhere and the information about California, specifically, is limited to the appendices.Since I don't see any other book with competing data about buying a home in California, it certainly would be worth purchasing, and again, the material here is quite concise and practical for buying anywhere in the US."
2,NOT Durable enough for small children,"I thought I was getting a deal when I purchased this item on sale for $25. While the unit itself is well made, the books fall apart far to easily. They are made of heavy paper instead of heavy tyvek like the LeapPad books. The books are not bound like the LeapPads either. The first time my three year old twins got a hold of it, the first book and every book after it, fell apart simply from turning the pages back and forth. Don't blow your money on this. I've contacted the company and have gotten no response. I recently saw the books on clearance at Best Buy for $1 each...which tells you something...Don't buy it unless it's for older, more gentle children..."
1,Don't waste your money,"Not only do the books fall apart easily, but the magnetism that makes the pen work ceases to function properly after a year. The book simply will not respond to the pen. I've changed batteries, cleaned the connections just as the company suggested when I called, neither worked. There's a reason these are going ""out of print."""
1,OP Juice-Ocean Pacific,"I purchased this for my daughter who lives in Florida. Since it was such a late date to arrive at my address and then be shipped to her,I asked to have it shipped directly to Florida, which it was not. However, when I received it, I sent it on to my daughter, and when sheopened it,the spray would not work.I am disappointed.Florence See"
3,Better on you than on me,"I first ""smelled"" this perfume on someone who was shopping in the same aisle as I. It was a very pleasant, refreshing fragrance. Well, not on moi. Have to use half a bottle just to have some fragrance. Very nice bottle, though. Would not purchase it again for me."
4,good,"It is a good book,I think the author could give more nutrition recipes.The manual calculation for fertilizer very long and I think the author shout mention that some free programs on the net can do this calculation very fast.It is a good book about hydroponics."
1,Nice Machine at first,"Over the years I have purchased 5 machines....one for each of my homes, and one for each of my sons. All were digital Trevi machines no longer made. This machine has some nice improvements, but it took some adjustment to get there.The interior design is a definite improvement, and after a month of use I am very pleased.Unfortunately in the meantime I have fixed my Trevi....but I still use my Gaggia (I think this is actually a replacement machine as the Trevi is no longer available).I used the product for less than 12 months....it is now garbage. Totally unsatisfactory"
4,gaggia espresso machine review,"The machine works real well. We enjoy the flavor of the coffee and lattes in the evening. Our grown kids compare them to Starbucks, real good"
4,Gaggia,"Well, I have to add my 2cents about WholeLatteLove. Not customer service oriented AT ALL. Still waiting for a call-back from two days ago. Not holding my breath. And, not my first customer call to them about different topics either.Aside. I have owned the old Gaggia Syncrony for three years. It just died after making 4000 cups of espresso. Actually, it busted a water line. The dilema is finding someone competent enough to fix it without breaking the bank or buying the Gaggia Titanium.However, I would definitely upgrade to the Gaggia Titanium if I cannot get my Syncrony repaired due to excellent experience we have had with Gaggia.ALWAYS clean the frothing nozzle after each use! Highly recommend Gaggia."
1,don't buy,Major problems with the setup. Further research shows many complaints about the steam wand/ventilate function. Don't wast your time or money!
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,"I BOUGHT THIS PILE OF CRAP A YEAR AGO AND JUST OPENED IT. THE PILE OF JUNK DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. I SET IT UP AND ALL IT SAYS IS ""VENTILATE"" - IT WON'T DO ANYTHING. AMAZON HAS NO SUPPORT FOR THIS MACHINE, NO PHONE NUMBER TO CALL. I WOULDN'T BUY ANYTHING ELECTRONIC FROM AMAZON AGAIN."
4,The First cup's the best,"I read the reviews and the only concern I had (other than the price tag) was that I would get the dreaded ""Ventilate"" message.I didn't. Setting up the machine was relatively easy. The only pesky issue (and this still remains) is getting the front panel on. For some reason, it's a struggle to get it back on. (The only I reason I take it off is to empty the grinded coffee box.)My first latte was so good. My second was even better.It is a loud machine when it makes coffee so I can't use early in the morning because it would wake the wife and kids.I purchsed the Lavazza coffee beans with it, and that is one smooth creamy cup of joe.I've had the machine since 6/4/08 (today is 6/16) and have not experienced any badness with the machine (knock on wood)."
1,It doesn't even work out of the box!!!,I set this up and got the same error message that led me to replace my other machine (a different model). After hours of attempts I only get Ventilate as an error and have not made a single cup of coffee. I want the machine gone and money back now. I wanted to give it no stars but it wouldn't let me.
2,Good for awhile...,"I've been making about 30 cups a week since I bought this machine in October 2009, but it just crapped out. I called around, and the only place I can find to repair it is the distributor. Locals won't touch it because the parts are hard to get, and the innards are all plastic. It would cost me $100 to ship it to the distributor and back, plus the cost of repair. I could be in for at least a few hundred dollars, and then I'd have a three year old machine, and something else could break. No thanks. A machine this expensive should last a lot longer. I'm now reading reviews to figure out what to replace it with."
2,Disappointing,"This was very disappointing. The video showed a lot of water, plants, mountains, but very little of Stavanger itself and the main points of interest in the city. There was no voice over to explain what you were watching. Basically, a very amateurish video...certainly not worth the $25. I am going to Stavanger soon and didn't find this to be very valuable in understanding the city or it's points of interest."
1,dull drum,"the drum i recieved and the drum in the picture are very different looking.the drum i have seems like a assembly line knock off and the sound is a very dull thump,the drum is not much to look at and it sounds even worse. i don't know if all their items are like this but i will not take another chance to find out. be warned"
3,nice cleats with girly color and too small for the size,"We ended up returning this one, as it ended up being a little too small for the size, and the color was obviously feminine. Other than these two points the shoe itself is quite fine. May be the smaller size is common among Adidas cleats - would love to hear from other parents with similar experiences. Ordered another black-red Adidas with one size higher. This comes up when searching for boy's shoes, so watch out parents!"
4,Pretty good,"This book isn't bad at all. I find myself picking it up when I'm trying to watch t.v. It has pretty good details about different things...fabrics, lighting, flooring, walls, etc. As another review stated, 'I wish it had more pictures', and I also wish it were longer. I really don't think it could have had any more detail though. It's well worth the money, no doubt. My next book will be ""remodeling for dummies""...."
3,So So!,I have read better home decorating books. As a basic book it is ok but it does not have any color pictures.
3,"Helpful, but somewhat outdated.","The book gives some very helpful tips for decorating, but many of the ideas seem outdated. There is a section on sponge painting, which I haven't seen since the mid-90s. I think it is a good book to get you started, but I would recommend design and architectural magazines to give you more updated ideas."
3,A nice little sleeper,"Mischa Barton is gorgous. No doubt about it. She also lights up the screen, but here she is just OK. And that really describes this film. It wasn't bad, in fact, it was alot better than I thought it was going to be. This isn't a thriller, this is definetely a drama. Didnt deserve those harsh reviews it got."
1,Product Fried my phone. Don't Buy it!!,"I had purchased this product and immediately after plugging it in, my phone powered off and would not restart. The battery got very hot. Because it was a 3rd party product, it voided my Manufacturer warrenty so I would now have to spend $400 for a new phone. This is not worth it. The merchant wouldn't refund my money."
5,A Fun to Read Contemporary Romance Novel,"Alexandria is a modern romance novel that reads with the excitment and speed of a comic book. It is not to be taken seriously, but to be enjoyed and shared. This is the kind of novel to take on a cruise or a relaxing vacation where you don't want to be annoyed by the violence of some tv shows.It is the perfect book for the beach or to read right before bedtime, a comfortable romantic story with delightful little surprises that you expect in a romance novel. I would recommend it to anyone who loves light romance."
1,Romance at it's worst,"It took 2 people to write this book, and they can't even get the name of their characters right, (changing the spelling of the names 3 lines apart). How sad can it be?Shallow plot, shallow characters, shallow development!Poor little unstable Lori must have led a very shaded life, if the TRAUMA of finding that the person she thought was a woman is in reality a man, leading her to all sort of misadventures, amnesia (who could deal with such an awful revelation, tell me, friends?) and a broken heart from this tragic betrayal.The time frame of the action doesn't make sense either.Just as well I could read the book without having to buy it."
3,It's NOT what I expected!,"I Never liked spyro games, but I loved Crash games so I thought that this would be really cool but it's kind of boring and short. It only took me 2 days to beat this. There is only 5 levels.And there is really nothing to do after you beat it. I'm not saying that this is a bad game I mean it's okay but just NOT what I expected! I would suggest renting it first. Now I kind of think it was waist of money to get this game out of saving for it. It was really nothing. Now after saving for this ""okay"" kind of game I think I'm going to rent games before I buy them. I NEVER used to rent games. But now thanks to this game I'm going to rent. So thanks alot Spyro Orange."
2,Pass on this one,"Of all the Spyro games this one has to be the worst one yet. I did not mind that he is in Crashes world however, they did not have to make it 2 dimensional. Spyro can only go 180 degrees not the 360 that he is able to do in his outher ones. And each level has the same challanges, that's no challange."
3,Decent,"Eh, this is a decent game. I kinda like Crash Purple more. I just wish there was more to do. Not a lot of mini-games. Pretty much it has the same pros and cons of Crash Purple, but somehow Crash Purple is funner. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
1,"Horrible, waste of time and money,THIS IS A MINI GAME!","I got this game as a birthday gift from my grandmother and she spent 40$ because she got it when the game came out...im 995 sure you will hate it. All you do is play minigames and complet it...I beat it over 4 times and I find it worse than spyro: enter the dragonfly, I love spyro games, but why, why make it so horrible."
4,worst spyro game ever,this game sucks the minigame are horrible and spyro can no longer glide he just flaps his wings once dont waste your money on this!
3,"Its ok, not great","I was pretty disappointed with this. Its not bad, just not good cassoulet. I was hoping it would be as good as what I can get in France but its not. Cassoulet is so time consuming to make I was hoping for a shortcut."
5,GREAT CLAY,My daughter loves this clay. She has used it on her pottery wheel and by creating little gifts for her family.
1,see more mites,"let me start off by saying don't waste your money!!the six grow rooms were fully mited, amateur sheist! this volume was an utter dissapointment. if you saw the first volume, don't expect a movie anywhere near the same calibre. vol. 1 taught you something you could replicate, as well as watch repeatedly to learn more every time. vol. 2, however, was not tutorial at all. it was simply full of footage of ridiculous grows. nothing was learned from it. what happened, see more buds??"
3,Lacks substance,"I agree with many of the reviews here. The book is interesting, readable, maybe even somewhat motivating, but not very helpful. When I got to the end of the book I didn't feel like I knew the author or her family any better than I did before. She obviously is a strong woman with a lot of wisdom to share, but she doesn't share it well. She doles out surface-skimming bullet points to address a WIDE variety of topics without giving much practical advice. Most of the things she recommends really are things most moms already know. There is no wit mixed in, few personal anecdotes - just nothing to make it seem REAL. I was definitely disappointed."
3,Informative,"I bought the book because as a mother of five, I felt connected to this woman from the start. At times while reading the book I felt convicted of being less than perfectly organized (as she seems to be) and a bit envious of her financial stability. (money does afford some people certain luxuries others cannot even fathom.) The book gives you a feeling of being capable of ""having it all"", yet may leave you feeling a bit envious of her seemingly ""perfect life"". Come on, look at that woman- she looks amazing for having all those kids.Good pointers, yet no specific plans laid out. It gives you a feeling of reinventing yourself."
2,Fluff...pass,"I couldn't believe how little this book actually taught me. It mainly repeats things most any Mom knows. I thought the book lacked spirituality, since I bought it at a Christian bookseller. It also has a recipe for veal....what family of 12 can afford veal???? I thought the answer of getting list of babysitters very impractical. I would have loved to see real life examples of her schedule and budget. This has male ghostwriter written all over it."
3,"Women First, Family Always","Very inspiring, but not a lot of anything new as far as self-help. I give Mrs. Sansone a heck of a lot of credit for raising 10 children in today's world and doing all she does."
2,disappointing,"I agree whole-heartedly with other reviewers that this is a good library book, but not a good purchase. To me it was very fluff. There was not much detail, or narrative to provide an engrossing read. I really didn't feel like there was anything to take away from what she wrote that wasn't already common sense."
1,She doesn't live in the real world,"I came from a family of ten, so I picked this book up to see what it was about. Truthfully, I found it ridiculous. Lucky for Mrs. Sansone that she was able to entertain Oprah in her lavish St. Louis mansion, but most people don't have wealthy husbands and basketball courts in their basements. Her advice is extremely simplistic and nothing new. In fact, it's even a throwback to the '50s. Put on lipstick for when your husband comes home. Carve out some time for yourself. Have date night with your husband. And oh, by the way, here's my chocolate chip cookie recipe. There's nothing that even begins to explain how to handle the sheer logistics of handling that many children, or why she felt compelled to have them in the first place."
2,Nothing New Here,"I was so disappointed with this book. I bought it wanting to love it. I figured I ought to be able to learn *something* from a mother of ten. But instead, I got a book that rehashes the Oprah Show and Dr. Phil. There's nothing new here at all. Sadly, the author didn't even really show us how she accomplishes the goals in her own life. There is no depth."
5,Nice Kit.,The company made to nice because they included everything you would need. I didn't have to run to the hardware store for each step. The video was helpful.
4,Great price,Not easy to find this same product at the local hardware stores with this price. Very easy to do it yourself if you follow the instruction.
5,Great product,"Sorry for the bad first review,it was towards a generator from another vendor.Anyway.love the product,what is more important is my electrician loves it to and will be recommending it to installed in all his new and upcoming work"
5,Great Kit,"This is a great kit that includes everything but 10/3 wire. It is nice with letter coded wires that make installation a snap and even includes a DVD showing you how to install it. I had to spend another $30 in 10/3 wire for the remote plug in for outside, but that is one of the main reasons to get this one, to be able to put the generator inlet plug anywhere you want so your generator can be in the place that allows the least noise to your living space. The 10 foot generator cord even has an adapter so you can use it with a 30 amp or 20 amp generator. I almost can't wait for my next power outage! ;-)"
3,Haven't used it yet,I haven't used the Reliance Generator transfer switch. I will do a better review in the future on this particular item after I have had to use it. The item was sent in a timely manner.
5,Easy to install,Got this hooked up the day before hurricane Sandy hit. Worked awesome. All I added was the wire to run out to the external receptacle. Very happy I chose the 10 circuit one versus the smaller one. Great value.
5,"Shoulda, woulda, coulda done this years ago...","...if I'd realized just how easy it was.Seriously. I've wanted and needed a backup generator to supply essential services in my rural home for some time. Although I'm a handy guy (professional grade) I never really explored transfer switches and just ASSUMED that putting one in place would be a real hassle. A friend finally set me straight and I bought this Reliance Controls unit.Installation was as straight forward as it comes. A kid's wagon would be more difficult to assemble than this was to install. The directions provided by Reliance were crystal clear and for those who can't read, they offer a step by step video on their website<g>The video is worth watching to get a good overview of the project even if you don't think you need anything other than the written instructions.Quality product from a quality manufacturer backed up by excellent customer support."
5,Reliance transfer switch,Came with an excellent Dvd that explained everything you needed to know about installation and operation. I don't usually do this stuff and I did it with no problems. Great product. Here's hoping that I never have to use it but I'm ready.
1,Disappointing,Terrible pictures and almost all the puzzles require leaps of imagination. Neither my children nor myself found the 'whimsical'names and stories anything but inane. A disappointment.
5,Better than foam backing types,"Have used a foam backed table pad for years and the foam comes off after awhile, so really was glad to find this flannel backed pad. Other reviewers said they cut to size and you could do this easily, but one reviewer said they left it hang off edge and it helped tablecloth to drape better. That really works well and does improve drape of the cloth. After a couple days the ""creases"" flattened out, these were from the shipped folded pad, so not to worry about them at first. This fit my table just perfect with about a 4 inch drop."
5,Super Table Pad,"We have an elegant crate & barrel dining table and did not want any heat marks, scratches or dents on our wooden table, so underneath our table cloth we always have this table pad or ""protector"". It has worked very well so far. Definitely worth the money to protect our dining table."
4,Cushioned table pad,"This is a little thinner than I expected, but it should do the job. I needed something to protect the table from my cats' claws."
5,A healing balm for the soul.,Dispels fear and reminds you what is really at stake. A lovely wonderful work.
2,Unwilling Desire Back Cover,"Falsely accused-twice in one lifetime. Holly hadn't encouraged the affections of her boss, James Benedict. And she couldn't bear the thought of being held responsible for the final breakup of his marriage to Maxine-not when she already had one ruined marriage on her conscience.To prove her innocence, she went along with Zack Benedict's risky scheme to make his brother jealous enough to overcome his crippling disability and reclaim his estranged wife's love.But when Zack's desire for Holly overshadowed his concern for his brother's happiness, Holly tried desperately to avoid the accusations from her own disabling past."
4,Works...,"A bit pricey, but I couldn't find them in bulk, so I got just enough for my project. Seem to be good quality and work in my application.These are listed as toys, but are not toys themselves. They can be used in toys, but that was not my application."
3,Good advice but a bit outdated for our times,"I read this book as a married woman and a social worker and was half amused, half thinking ""this isn't right!"". Some of the tips are practical like laying out what you want while staying realistic, being approachable, etc. Other ""tips"" such as ""wear a blouse with a low-slung neckline"", rubbing the inside of your thigh to show you like a guy, try to make sure the guy is always having a good time, or that manipulation of the relationship can be useful are kind of tasteless. But if you REALLY want to find a guy and are willing to do these things, this book is for you!"
3,A Woman's Guide to Finding the Man,"A little different approach and there are several good points in the book. For thoses whom are shy or have problems finding a man, this would make a good guide."
4,Still using it after football season,"I bought this primarily for use during the football season when Sunday Funday is at my house every week. I am finding that it has come in handy for a couple of other events, including my daughter's baby shower. The construction is very solid, and it performs as I had expected. I may have been able to get away with a smaller size, but the XLG means I don't have to choose which dishes deserve to stay warm."
5,Straight from San Antonio,"This is a great album with a live concert feel. The tracks ""Taking Away"" and ""Time 4 Me 2 Go"" are among my favorites. A great CD to check out and play especially to mix into your rock collection for parties. A must buy for San Antonio and Texas natives."
5,Superb! But who plays guitar to Louis' act anyway?,"Seriously, this is a great volume to have to accompany his albums. There will only be one Louis."
2,Not loving it,I only purchased this cologne for the name I mean how cool is it to own a bottle of cologne with your name on it but to describe it is to say it is nothing spectacular and smells like every other cologne that came out in the 70's or when ever it was produced it is an outdated scent best worn by the elderly I guess now when someone says Derrick stinks I cant get offended
3,Not really what I want to wear,"Wish I didn't need these at all, but alas, I truly do. This is a good line. Only limitation was that they are knee-high and just about cut off my circulation at the knee, Shoved them in a drawer and ordered a couple pairs of the mid-thigh length--must more comfy."
3,PAL DVD,"This DVD is Region 0...PAL, not NTSC!Will not play on all US DVD players.It is also just the musical performances."
4,No Real Middle Ground Here....,"...you are either going to love or hate this album. Personally, I love the entire album. Dime's riffs are a major stand-out, of course, but the backbeat from Vin and Rex is quite well done. Now, Coe's voice isn't something I would have really envisioned for this type of music -- but it is there, and he is the Country Music scene's balls-to-the-wall rebel, so the attitudes do match.Stand-out tracks for me were Cowboys Do More Dope, the (sadly) short Panfilo (which has some excellent acoustic riffing), One Nite Stands, and N.Y.C. Streets."
4,Now that's good Southern Rock,"Wow. David Allen Coe does a project with the boys from Pantera (minus Phil, the drunken idiot), and what a way to honor the memory of Dime.Plenty of good Southern Rock is served up here by some of the most influential metal musicians of the last 15 years and fronted by one of the most controversial and well known old-school country singers of all time.This is the kind of stuff you listen to when you're hangin out with your friends at a barbecue having a few beers.Hank Williams III even makes an appearance on the song ""Get Outta My Life"", a real treat for me since I am a big Hank fan.So, if you like Molly Hatchet, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Hank III, & Black Label Society, you should dig this. Heavy guitars, solid drums with Country stylings. Good shtuff."
2,Musical fodder for teenagers of any age,This cd blows. It sounds like all the music of this genre from the last thirty years. David Allen Coe should have known better.
2,I really wanted to like this CD,"Now, let me say that I have loved Pantera and Damage Plan from the start. The break up of Pantera and the loss of Dimebag are two of metal's biggest tragedies, so I really looked forward to hearing this CD, which warned me to be open minded before listening. Vinnie, I was so let down. I can't be that open minded, or my brains will fall out. I loved hearing the signature guitar and drums, but the vocals . . . Please don't think that I am, as another fan put it, ""spitting in Dime's face."" I spoke with you at the Clubhouse about how much I missed your brother. I just think that others should know that this CD is best purchased by fans of both Country and Metal and not by those simply looking for a tribute to your's and Dime's early work with Pantera and Damage Plan. Good luck with the CD. I am sure that many will disagree with me, and who know's? Perhaps, you will successfully pioneer a new genre, but for me, I am remaining loyal to the metal that I know and love."
1,Terrible,"I have no idea why this has relatively high reviews. I like David Allan Coe and Pantera (to a much bigger extent), but my initial instinct was that this would not mix well. However, I decided to give it a chance because I like both of them and I have heard alternative country with punk influences that worked pretty well. I thought if any people could make this cohesive, these would be the ones.Nope. It sounds worse than I could have possibly imagined. David Allan Coe sounds awful. He is off-key, lazy and sloppy sounding. The same can be said for the band. It seems and sounds like they aren't used to playing that slow, so they don't do it well.Too bad dimebag didn't collaborate with Hank Williams III. Wouldn't that have been a much more interesting mix?"
2,Mobile home trash music,Horrible.... Just horrible. Sorry vocals with just load guitars. It's for redneck metal heads.
1,The Goat,"Remember that Adam Sandler album where he hits that goat in the head with a football? Well, I didn't know that the goat sang horribly mundane metal songs. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this, but it sounds like Rex, Vinny and Dime are torturing a goat while playing well below their creative level. Painful to listen to on all levels."
2,"Great music, singer sucks","Ok I'll make it short but sweat great music, singing sucks...this guy is flat every song and he should go back to the honk tonk and get away from rock...if you think I'm lying listen close how can anyone listen to this voice, HE CAN'T HOLD A NOTE AND SOUNDS LIKE HE HAS A MOUTH FULL OF MUSH, he sucked atcountry and has no place in rock...home boy go back to Texas andget back to branded some cows cause you suck."
4,"A little awkward at first, but then it ROCKS!","This is such an interesting CD. It feels so ""off"" upon first listen, but then reels you in with its diversity. The vocals and guitars belong in seperate worlds, yet they seem to come together on the same planet here....rocking you silly and leaving a smile on your face!"
4,"Awesome Music, But Something You Have To Be ""Into""","I purchased this album because Dimebag is my favorite guitarist. Those who are Dimebag fans will love this album; those who want to put it under a microscope (or oscilloscope) will find fault. This album is all about Dimebag. If you like Pantera, Damageplan or even Unknown Hinson, then do not hesitate to buy it. I hope the haters get their money back. It's not for everyone. But that's what was so great about Dime."
3,Not bad,"At first, I thought this was album was as good, if not better than a lot of Pantera albums. Instrumentally, it is very good, but the more I listened to it, the more David Allan Coe got annoying: the lyrics more so than the singing. This is a good addition for Dimebag fans, not so much for DAC or Pantera fans."
4,One tough shield,"I put this shield on our Ford F250 Super Duty 4X4 while in Alaska for 2 years. It installed in just a few minutes and is holding up well. In Fairbanks,AK they don't use sand or salt,instead they use rock. The shield has been hit by these rocks and was not broken. Now understand that no shield is rock proof as we saw many shields that had broke with just the right hit. Driving down to Texas last year this shield did help keep some of the bugs off windshield as we could see them go over our heads while others did hit."
3,Outdated,"Vagabonding in Europe and North Africa was written in the late 60s and early 70s. The writing style clearly shows that, as does much of the advice listed and the information about each country.He writes exactly as you would expect a 1960s free spirit to write, not saying that it is a bad thing, but something to adjust to. He is a funny author and very encouraging, which is important in writing about long-term very budget travel.Some advice is very good, however some of the advice is outdated and no longer relevant. Example: ""East Germany and the Communist East.""Overall this book could be useful in showing how traveling used to happen, and to encourage today's travelers to think outside the box.I would recommend reading Rolf Potts' Vagabonding to start with. You can find it hereVagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel"
2,Biased from the first page,"I have to disagree with the other reviewer. I read this book as a student in Olasky's History of Journalism class at the University of Texas several years ago. Olasky writes with an obvious and declared anti-abortion bias and chooses his examples and even his wording with care. At the very beginning of the book, he goes into great detail about how he decided on his terminology for the book, and why he decided to refer to the ""unborn child"" rather than the ""fetus"" or another word for the victim of abortion. I am actually anti-abortion myself, but as a journalism graduate and writer, I can't condone the heavy bias of Olasky's book. It simply does readers and researchers a disservice."
3,Too many words,"Alin Marthouret - French forger, who did his time (which is a plus) and got into painting while in jail; went into forgery - fair enough and quite challenging: Van Gogh, Gauguin, Modigliani, even Gerome, but the results are not up to the standard (which is a minus), inconvincing, and might deceive only an ignorant sucker. Talks too much about his spiritual connections with the great masters, and talks too much in general( the book was originally published under the title ""L'art en feu"" - ""Art in fire""). Master Forger he was (is) not, for sure, until recently there was one only - Eric Hebborn (Drawn to Trouble: The Forging of an Artist,The Art Forgers Handbook), murdered in Rome after he started talking (and writing) - apart from those few who have enough wisdom to keep their mouth shut - may God bless you, guys! So if you are in a mood to read another second rate ""roman policier"", then you can buy it. If you won't - you won't lose anything."
4,Worth buying,I bought this watch since sometime and it works absolutely fine!! Looks great with just about anything!!The only complain is that it came in a Kenneth Cole NY box....
3,Great Recipes But Some Mistakes!,"This is overall a great cookbook, some great ideas, I've made some desserts from it and they are delicious. I was looking for something like this when I fell upon it at out local Borders bookstore. The only problem is many of the recipes contain yogurt, which ALWAYS contains gelatin(which I think most people know is boiled animal connective tissue, skin and bones). I don't know if Sue Spitler realized this and didn't care or didn't know or what. Also, some of the recipes called for Woccessire (Sp?) sauce, and that has Anchovies in it. None of the recipes are supposed to contain meat, fish or poultry. But overall, a great book. Many of the recipes are bland, some of them have strange ingredients, and some of them are pretty high in calories, actually higher or equal in calories than the normal kinds. Others have less calories, yes, but that's because the portions are smaller. So, basically, I would say, if you are really interested, buy it. If not, look elsewhere."
2,Fat-free heavy cream?,"Although this has great ""ideas,"" it's not practical. Every time I try to use this book, I find recipes with fat-free ingredients I have never seen, such as fat-free heavy cream, fat-free parmesan, etc. Take any recipe from any other book and substitute fat-free ingredients (if you can find them), and voila, you have a low-fat recipe!"
2,Yuck!,"I've been a vegan for about two months, and my meat-eating husband has liked everything I've made so far . . . with the exception of the few recipes from this cookbook I have tried. I have to say I wasn't impressed either. However, to the authors' credit, some of the quick breads and desserts look promising, though most would require some modifications to be made vegan."
2,not a reliable cookbook,"I have had this cookbook for several years and have made many recipes in here. I'm about to give up on this book. So many of them are just not good. I need to be able to trust a cookbook, and I am not able to rely on this one. Save your money."
4,Playfully spooky,"A playfully written Halloween book with just enough ""spooky"". It is written from the perspective of the witches. Artwork and dialogue is intriguing to youngsters. A favorite of my 3-year-old."
3,Wordless Woggle??,"Purchased for my granddaughters, they thought this would be a cute story book. Well it arrived timely, and we sat down that evening to read the new book. There were very few words in the book to begin with, and it didn't get much better throughout. The story isn't really a story at all. And the author is not too clear on what they are wanting to portray. The Artwork is great and delivers a few laughs, but the book is not a good reader book. Cute, but short and not well written."
1,my idea of 'good used' condition isn't 'falling apart',"I was excited to find this favorite book from my kids' childhood as a surprise to be sent to one of them away at college. I assumed ""GOOD Standard used condition"" meant that the book wouldn't threaten to fall apart when you held it. The binding is broken badly, there are torn pages and parts of the hard cover that appear to be chewed off. The book has stamps and stickers throughout, including on the front cover, directly over the picture, and frankly I am embarrassed to send it as a gift--seems more like a joke. I am very disappointed and will absolutely not trust, nor buy from this seller again. I did not send the book back because there is not time to search for a different one. Lesson learned."
2,This thing is harder than the traditional Rubik's Cube.,"Of course, that's not because it's more mentally challenging. It's more difficult to twist and turn the pieces, because they are of different sizes and shapes. Maybe this is the kind of toy you have to ""break in"" for a while before it seems to work right, but I find it too annoying to manipulate to even bother trying to put the head back together."
3,"Ambitious, but flawed novel about the lives of five women.","Alice Adams produced a good book in ""Superior Women"". It is good enough to recommend reading, but it has some flaws that prevent it from being great. Adams's books tend to be feminist, which this book definately is. I do like Megan and Peg, who both become rather feminizied by the end. Adams also likes to portray sex. Lots and lots of sex. This book doesn't disappoint, that way. I did find Megan a bit annoyingly neurotic. Peg has the best transformation: from overweight, unsure girl to confident lesbian activist. The ""bitchy"" one, Lavinia, reaps the whirlwind, which is satisying. And Cathy wrestles with her faith, and is deal a bad hand. The ending was fitting, and I did like how some of the friends got together to help others. Unfortunely, these women may be ""superior"", but this novel is sadly mundane."
5,Wow....,"This book was great. The action was never ending in this book and there was always something going on but what I loved about it was that though there was a lot of different things going on, it all connected somehow so it wasn't just action to fill in the book.I also liked that you get to see and know more about Ross, River Bend's quietest ranch hand. Before, he was just someone there but you felt like you really didn't know him and this book let you see a little more of him.This is a MUST read for any Phantom Stallion book. It has more pages then the last few new ones have been too. This is deffinatly not a boring book!"
5,That's The Fun!,This is a great video full of laughs and fond memories of the spirit Dimebag had for life. It is completely amusing to see some of the stunts they pulled and things they filled their time with when they were not playing music! Also it is very cool to get a more inner-perspective on the type of genuine guy Dime really was!
4,Old footage made it worthwhile,"This video contained about half of Dime and his buddies just fooling around with fireworks and the other half of him actually playing. There was great old footage from the 80s of Dime jamming out in front of small crowds with Rex and Vinnie. A couple of my favorite clips are of Dime back in 84 I think, playing the end of ""Floods"" and also of them covering Metallicas ""Seek and Destroy"" also in the 80s. I didnt care to much of the firework videos, it is almost like watching an episode of Jackass. But if you want to see how Dime is when he is not playing guitar you'll like that part. Toward the end is a great speech by Dime that really tells what he is all about. Good overall... Worth getting if you are a real Pantera/ Dimebag fan."
2,Only for hardcore Dimebag fans who dont care about quality,"I was lucky enough to pay 2.99 for this at my local used CD shoppe. It was worth the 2.99 and that's about it. It is essentailly a bootleg , a poor man' s "" Cliff em all"" , if you wil. Some cool vintage clips of dime playing guitar during the Pre-Cowboys era....and some excellent photo montages. THe rest of hte DVD is a bunch of skits of him lighting fireworks everyplace. Saw the DVD once, now hoping to make a few dollars off it by selling on ebay. For hardcore fans only."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,It was cool seeing old dime footage but its a total ripp off man! the stupid DVD freezes up and so on. save your money or give it to me and ill come to your house and kick you in face because thats how you will feel after getting ripped off !
5,R.I.P. Dime,"This is a great DVD to add to your collection of Pantera videos. It's pretty much a camera either in Dime's hands, or in somebody else's. Some of this stuff is hilarious, and you'll laugh your a** off. Other times you're jaw will drop at the sight of the guitar legend doing what he does best. Hell, I even got choked up a couple of times. This DVD captures Dime in all of his greatness and I recommend any fan of his to check it out!"
2,OK,"It had some great moments of his early and late playing, but mainly just moments and not the whole songs. A lot of playing with fireworks, and drinking, and ""jack ass"" type behavior. One thing, it is quite something to see the way he was, and what 15 years of drinking did to his appearance. Kind of sad, and I wonder how much longer he would have lasted."
2,Disappointed,"I was specting more about this DVD, they just put some small parts of several moments of Dime's life, excluding everything related with Phil and just putting some solo moments...I was wondering and I am really curious of what they will putt on part II...You can find more at youtube..."
3,not really what you would expect,"This DVD consists of slide shows of dimebag photos, old footage of dimebag playing his many guitars, and dimebag and his friends shooting fireworks at each other(this makes up for about half of the DVD). There is a scene about half way through where there is some guy that does donuts with his truck in dumebags driveway and in this he leaves plenty of black marks, tears up the yard and destroys the shrubs in front of his house, blows a tire, and keeps on going. Honestly the dvd is worth it for that. if you want to watch old footage of dimebag from the 80's and early 90's or if you enjoy him and his friends shooting fireworks at each other (much like he did in ""Sinema"")then this DVD is definately for you."
2,No cables are provided!,"I haven't actually set the thing up yet, but just a warning... I received the KVM switch but not any USB KVM cables as listed in the product description and on the manufacturer's website. When I contacted the company (PC Universe), they told me to return it for a refund, which isn't very helpful and doesn't solve my problem.I am still trying to work this out with their customer service. Buyer beware!"
4,Transforming Qualitative Information,"This book gives a very good overview of the Qualitative process in a doctoral research program. Found this to be a useful comparison of other packages like Atlas, and Ethnograph just to name two. This is a book that would be useful for graduate students in either the Master's program or Doctoral program."
2,All-Around Bad,"When I first got to the unboxing, the item was heaped with dust all over the place, making it look very old. I originally had a different set of headphones to use earlier, but when those broke, after using this pair of headset, it's awful. The headset itself has OK quality if you're a music person. For gamers that use the microphone, For me, a typical 2-hours a day type of player, It broke within two weeks. Oh, and to be truly honest here, I've started using this pair of headphones during December, but it's now Jan. 14, 2012, and a part of it broke. It may be because of how large my head is, but I really believe that this shouldn't be bought. Its price itself is too high for the build quality on this item."
5,Even better than the first,"The original Voodoo Roux was very good, but this one's a masterpiece. Note for note, beat for beat, track for track, it surpasses the orignal. This is one of the most exotic, erotic albums ever compiled. I dare anyone to NOT be aroused by track #4 ""Robbery of Vibrations"". Then there's the tranquil mantras of ""Coming Down"" and ""Sleep at the Swamp"". Pure danciblity with ""Chime"" and ""Bannana Tribbio"". (Love that title!)Track 7, XIS's ""Sun Walker- Moon Runner mix"" is, I guess, a remix of the original ""Sun Walker"" track which appeared on the first ""VooDoo"", but it comes across as a completely different piece to me. It's longer and much more intrigueing.The concluding Bjorn piece, ""SixFiveOneOh"" is lengthy,mesmeric and a much more satisfiing conclusion than the first albums last track. What the title refers to is anyone's guess, it's just gorgeous.An investment in exotic soundscapes. Buy it now!"
1,ugh!,"I have cds that i have paid $1.99 for and they are still better than this misbegotten, old and tired knob twilrling bad example of (shudder)electronica."
5,A very highly recommended pick for all ages,"Fans of Arthur Rackham's style of drawing from turn-of-the-century fairy tales will find Fairy Tale Illustrations In Full Color an especially appealing collection reproducing over fifty of his fantastical drawings from rare early plates. Packed with appeal from cover to cover, Fairy Tale Illustrations In Full Color is a very highly recommended pick for all ages."
5,A grate collection of Rackham's fairy tale illustrations,Indeed a grate collection of various fairy tale illustrations. A must have if you are a Rackham or fairy tale lover regardless of your age.
2,Many diverse facts little synthesis,"This book is all over the map. Reading along you discover a number of very interesting facts about early robotics, cinema, toy manufacture and circus life. The facts are never brought together in any meaningful way. There seems to be a thread that can be constructed from the journey from the initial attempts at artifical life in the early Age of Enlightenment to the modern world of robotic manufacturing and artifical intellegence. This thread is never investigated in this book. It is actually a series of disjointed tales all dealing with the perception of ""life"" in various intellectual climes. It just doesn't seem to come together into any sort of intelectually satisfying way."
5,A Time to Grieve,"This is an excellent set of books to help through the grief processes. I recommend this for anyone going through it, my wife passed away."
4,space marines,"The book came on time and in excelent condition. Although not alot of facts or photos of the ""Aliens"" film. you have a plethoria of fact about the colonial marines. Enough to say that if I were 40 years younger I would consider joining them.the technical side is very very good and believableworth ev ery penney/cent"
5,Great book,"I've been looking for this book since I lost it in 2001. Great to have it back. Wonderful read, even if it may seem dated. Greatw ay to bring yourself back to the world of ALIENS."
4,"A ""must have""? Eh...","Bought this site-unseen since I was so hyped to get a ""technology"" book based on the ALIENS movie. My overall review is just ""eh...""There is an absolute ton of detail, but it's written as a tecnical-manual (boring). I was expecting more pictures/diagrams/exploded views. I was really looking forward to seeing some detailed pics of the smart gun and the motion tracker, but there are only a couple of cursory pics, and a ""history"" of how the new stuff was better than the original. ehI can't deduct stars from my review since the book was not what I expected, so I'll still give it 4 stars based on the solid amount of work they put into this book. But I'll deduct one star for what I think is a big miss on what a really entertaining fiction-tech book can be."
3,Aliens Colonial Marines Technical Manual - Review,"This book has allot of information but I felt the art work was only fare. No fold-outs and hardly any color panels. Its too bad DK Publishing,out of the UK, didnt do this book. They have been doing all the Marvel and DC comic book manuals and their style is breath-taking. If you are afan of the Alien movie series and just love all things Alien, I would get this book but if you are just a dabbler, I would buy this book used."
4,very techincal,"I am a Marine and this book was writen either by a Military Officer or someone ith a good understanding of us. It has spcific technical data that deminstrates a deep understanding of the Aliens universe and the back story of the Colonial Marines. Alot of infomraiton on the colonial Marines, but almost nothing onthe Aleines or any other aspect of the films. The book is a bit dry, if your not a military member or a Marine you may want to skip this book"
2,Cheap and poor-fitting,"The quality of the materials and sowing is terrible, just good enough to hold together for one day. I ordered S-M since there were no XS or just S, and the jacket was way too big in the shoulders and waist. The skirt was okay, the red tie and shirt sometimes got out from the underneath the jacket, revealing to everyone at the party that it's in fact a bib. The horns were way too tight-fitting, so I had to take them off after an hour or so.Additionally, the costume arrived in half-opened package that seemed to be hanging at a warehouse for too long.As usual, you get what you pay for."
1,Inappropriate,"I read ""Raven of the Waves"" because a student I was tutoring chose it for his historical fiction novel. Since he needed help with his book report, I decided to read it too. I can honestly say that if I were his parent, I would not have wanted him to read the book. It is inappropriate, especially in how he talks about ""mounting"" women and raping them. He also includes a scene where he turns a man into a ""bloody eagle""--basically opening him from the back and spreading out his skin. When I finished the book, I was left with the thought, ""That is it? The book is done?"" In my mind it left loose ends and I did not see a purpose to the book."
1,Green Eggs and Ham/The Cat in the Hat,Absolutely terrible. There is no animations. The characters are portrayed almost as book pages on film. The voice is a monotone with no inflections or animation. Overall a very poor value and not to be confused with any optimal Dr. Seuss videos. BUYER BEWARE.
2,Not a cartoon????,This video (UK format) is not a cartoon in the true sense. And they have adverts in the middle about other Random House Seuss books which makes the kids think that the video has actually finished.
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,I paid for a canopy with full enclosure but thats not what i got from UPS. I recieved a canopy with the top ONLY!..I was very pissed off to find the enclosure walls...as promised...missing! It s my only day off to put it together... I also got the canopy with (not so good) instructions....part of the instructions werent explained properly and were not accurate.
3,"""I Will Live Forever""","I admit it. I have never been a big fan of Celia Cruz. Her voice is like a car with one speed--full speed straight ahead. Her voice has the subtlety of a sledgehammer. This album is mostly pure salsa. It is good for dancing and parties. The band is tight and well-directed with a clear high-fidelity sound. The title comes from her remake of the old disco hit, ""I Will Survive."" I really didn't want to hear this song again. Celia gives the song new meaning, however, by telling us that she will live forever through her music. My favorite song of the album is ""If By Chance I Don't Return (to Cuba)."" This is a poignant, moving message. And at her age, it is a possibility. In more than one way she is telling us goodbye with this album. But she recently said in an interview, ""May it be God who retires me."" So, if her health holds up, we will have more recordings from Celia Cruz. The album notes provide the lyrics. Total playing time 51 minutes."
2,Not one of Celia's best,"Celia Cruz made a stunning ""comback"" (not that she was every gone) with Mi Vida es Cantar, in 1998, one of the best salsa albums ever. She made three more albums before her death in 2003. Siempre Vivire was the first of these, and it is her least successful. There are a couple good songs, but none are really memorable or distinctive, and some are quite bland.While the other three albuoms from her ""final"" period have a very definite sound and character, this one just tried to be kind of hip and splashy, but never really catches on."
4,I wish there were more books like this,"Being Thai and female, I am delighted to see a book that provides another Thai female's perspective on Thai Buddhism. Buddhism in Thailand has an interesting twist. Organized Buddhism in Thailand displays a rather intresting divergence from the teachings of buddha. This book captures a view on this divergence (Dr. Kabilsingh calls it ""corruption of Buddhism"") and offers an explanation on how it has affected the Thai women place in Buddism.Dr. Kabilsingh's book is used as a platform for a small group of Thais who are trying to rally for the legal rights of Buddhist nuns in Thailand (to be equal to monks), e.g. free medical services, etc.In the early 2000s, Dr. Kabilsingh finally gave up her civilian life and decided to be ordained as a Bhiksunee (a female monk) - a controversial act that attracted many critics in Thailand. They asked ""Why can't she be a nun?"" ""Why try to be equal to a monk (Bhiksu)?"". This book will help answer some of those questions."
4,An Original Talent.,"An authentic original talent, Vonda Shepard's creativeness for soul touching, jam stomping hits and out right exceptional vocals have placed her has a serious singer/songwriter, performer. I really like her approach to a good jam.Check out:`Walk Away Renee' (cover, Songs From Ally McBeal)`Will You Marry Me?' (Songs From Ally McBeal)`Looking For Something'`A New Marilyn'`Hold Out'`Don't Cry Ilene'"
2,Don't waste your time,"very poor graphics and just poorly planned. stick with Men of Valor, Medal of Honor series, etc."
1,A poor excuse for a first-person shooter,"Primitive graphics, very clueless enemy and friendly A.I., and repetitive and boring gameplay all combine to make Marine Sharpshooter 2 a complete waste of money. I enjoy most other first-person shooters, but this one belongs in some 99 cent special bin at a software outlet store. Don't bother."
4,good game i like it,"its not the greates game ive played but not bad,im on the 2nd mission,ill probly finish it....ron"
3,Like others have said,"As many others have said, the product works well enough on carpets, but poorly on uncarpeted flooring. For my purposes, I have lots of wall to wall rugs. Otherwise, I would have returned it."
3,Sweeper,"It works pretty well. I wanted it for the kitchen when I am cooking and making a mess. It does not handle flour or sugar, but gets the larger pieces."
5,LP130 lamp,I was very pleased with the shipment of the order. I received my order in 2 days. The price was reasonable compared to other sites as well.
3,Better examples of his short stoties elswhere,"The majority of the short stories in this book are early attempts of parts of his first novel: Somebody in boots. These stories show the promise of the writer to come, but, unless you are a ardent fan, there are better collections of his short stories than this on the market."
5,Outstanding Modern Work on the Meaning of Zoroastrianism,"Offering deep insights into the fundamental teachings of one of the most important persons in the history of humankind, this glowing book creatively transcends the usual audience to serve the greater interests of everyone on our planet. Moreover, aside from the ancient scriptures themselves, perhaps no other single work is as important as this one to today's Zoroastrians and Zoroastrian scholars. Quite unlike any other treatise on the subject, Professor Mehr breathes life into the layers of wisdom brought to us from a distant past, peeling away the mists until the reader sees these revelations radiate with the brilliance that ultimately caused civilization itself to burst forth from humankind. Anyone who has the slightest interest as to why we are here and what we are supposed to do will want to read this fascinating and important work."
1,Very mediocre book,"While selecting a Text Book for teaching the Undergraduate Comparative Religion Class, I happened to read this book. I found it extreemely mediocre and unworthy as a text book. It is more like a preaching sermon and than a text book, being compounded by poor English as also least scholarly. The author is the political figure in Pre-revolution Iran and an expert in politics rather than in religion"
2,somewhat dissapointed,"I bought this product for the control of gofers, perhaps that is my problem for it does not seem to do the job. I have only used a small portion of it so far so perhaps with time the results will improve."
3,Too soon to tell...,I haven't noticed any difference in the mole population in my backyard but I just started using this product and I hope that the winter rains will help dissolve the granules and drive the castor oil deeper into the soil and cause the rodents to flee my backyard.
2,Joseph the Carpender in his shop with the Child Jesus -Topic,"I have been ad admirer of Georges de la Tour for years. I have seen his works in Museums. I was anxious to have a print of my own. I have had experience hanging prints and photos in local museums and have an Art History degree. I mention this just to let you know that I understand Chiarosuro technique. Surely I am not attempting to match the technique of an oil classic. However I feel the print that was purchased by my husband via Art.com is too dark.The iconic elements and symbolic representation cannot be seen. I will be returning this print and hope to ask Art.com if they can replace it, instead of just cancel my order. The frame was fine and the package arrived in good shape. It is just the rendering of the print itself that is (totally) unsatisfactory."
4,good stuff,"The book does have good information , practical and cheap things to do to improve the property value. I found it to be a good resource for my clients before the property hits the market."
4,It might be right for you?,"The idea for such a book IS a good one. The ideas are certainly sound..... I live in a newish(6yrs) 6000+ sq ft house,with a neighborhood association,good school district(etc) and felt that this book would NOT apply to my market.... however it could be useful for someone that lives in an urban or older neighborhood.... where a house might need curb appeal or sprucing up.... the thought of adding value to a sale is always appealing no matter what the size of your 'estate' ... no matter how deep or thin your pockets are! It is always a challenge to make the most of what you have."
2,"Limited, Indeed","I tried with this album--oh, how I tried. I was one of those who declared ""Elevator"" an absolute masterpiece, and argued with people who tried to claim HHH were losing their edge and headed down a slippery slope to VH-1 land. Well, I STILL think ""Elevator"" was a brilliant album, but its detractors were right, too, apparently, because there is barely a trace of ""edge"" left on this mushy, bland collection of forgettable pop tunes. There's really only only one song worth repeated listenings, in my opinion, and that's the rousing, punchy ""Five Times Out of a Hundred."" After two years of production, filled with breathless announcements from the band that made it sound as though the second coming of ""Sergeant Pepper's"" was on the way, this dreck feels like a betrayal. Why, then, even give it two stars? Because it still features the magnificent Steve Bays on vocals. Whatever blame he shares for the lackluster songwriting, his tortured yelping is still balm for the soul."
3,cooling off,"They're getting further away from the new wave revival quiche that made them interesting in the first place, and distinguishable from other record company product like The Hives and The Vines. They can still write decent hooks, but this album attempts the same level of sophisticated production that Elevator did, and that doesn't always seem to fit the material. It comes across like they had a good idea for the hook, and fleshed it out with indie/pop-quiche, wall o'sound production, rather than focusing on songcraft. Sounds like an under-developed Strokes album."
3,"The writing is stellar, the plot isn't","My original comparison for this book was Gene Wolfe writing an issue of Marvel Comics' ""Tomb of Dracula."" This is not a ""mean"" comparison. I tend to use Wolfe when I want to compare a someone to the pinnacle of excellent writing in a genre (I compare Wolfe himself to Borges or Shakespeare, depending on how effusive I'm feeling). And, as far as comics go, I liked ""Tomb of Dracula."" But, on the other hand, I am damning Shepard with faint praise as well. Although The Golden has some excellent writing in it the novel ultimately strikes me as unfulfilling. There's a lot of wonderful visuals and high language, but underneath that, it's still a comic book This is also well worth reading if you are a Shepard fan. But I'd hesitate to recommend this blindly."
1,What?!,"I honestly have no idea what The Golden was about. I remember some irrelevant ""mistery"", I recall some ultra-cliche ancient vampire called The Patriarch, some interesting writing style which often spawned pointless paragraphs, and the thing I remember the most is that I really liked to book cover. And its the only thing I truly liked about this book... except the writing style... at times.Oh and it feels as if the writer really wanted to write about sex, but didn't have the courage to actualy go into details so he settled for kid-friendly descriptions of his fantasies.As for all else... one thing is certain: Lucius Shepard ain't my writer of choice and I sure won't be buying any more of his works."
4,High minded theology,"Karl Rahner (1904- 1984) was a maverick Jesuit theologian who was a big name in the New Theology Movement. This book was written with scripture close at hand with an intellectual point of view. For example, he discusses the Scholastic maxim: ""Good requires causality whole and entire; evil results from any lack."" (page 26) This is far above the thinking of most Christians. The final chapter asks the question, Can God be Experienced? The author answers by quoting scripture that comes off being intellectually correct. He is a theologian first and last.The contents are: (1) Can we still believe? (2) Believer amid unbelievers (3) Intellectual honesty & faith (4) Is faith possible in today's world picture? (5) Science & faith (6) Is faith an ideology? (7) Healing & salvation through faith (8) Faith today (9) Can God be experienced?"
2,City Mini Alert,"The bar itself works fine, just know that for the City Mini, it will not look like it does in this picture. In order to use the infant carrier bar with the City Mini, you have to take off the whole seat and canopy, leaving you basically with just the stroller frame. We're going to buy a stroller frame (for the same price as the bar) so we don't have to wait until our baby is out of the infant carrier seat to use the rest of the stroller (since it's not easy to switch back and forth from the frame to the regular stroller). If you have the room to store it, you may be happier getting a separate frame instead. Otherwise, the bar will work fine and you'll just have to wait to use the stroller part until baby grows out of the carrier."
2,Ok.........................,"I bought this case at Best Buy instead of here, but I can tell you that it protects your iPod well. But the bad thing is it fits 30GB, 60GB, and 80Gb iPods. So in order for it to work properly there is a plastic extra piece you have to put in so it does not rattle if you have a 30GB. It scratches up against my iPod and now it is ruined."
3,Great towels for the short term,"These towels are great - soft and lush, however, my baby was only able to use these for 2-3 months and then he grew too big! I would still purchase one or two towels just don't expect to use them for very long."
5,Soft and absorbent.,"These towels are not only very cute but they are soft, warm, thick and very absorbent. Hold up excellently in the wash/dryer. I have not had any problem with lint. I have a big six-month old and he is still doing fine with these - I'll be sad when he outgrows them. I was initially hesitant about purchasing them because of the cost, but they're well worth the money."
1,Wast of money,I must have been crazy to pay for this. I thought I was getting more information besides the same summary that you get on the back cover of the books.
3,CD a good choice for new Graciela fans,"This CD is good if you enjoy the heavy banda sound. The best songs on this CD are ""Sentimiento de Dolor,"" a smooth, flowing ballad, ""Tesoro,"" and ""Mi Corazon es Tuyo"" - both soft cumbias. ""La Pochita De Sinaloa"" is also interesting because it tells a story about a Mexican girl growing up in California, and her longing for her native culture. However, all these songs appear on her previous albums. The CD is recommended for any new Graciela fans out there."
5,Graciela es una cantante encantadora,"Sabes que? Creo yo que la mayoria todos de estos criticismos vienen de tejanas gordas y fodongas que estan celosas no mas. Ya sabemos que odian a las mexicanas y por medio de un foro anonimo sienten poderosas en 'en control' de algo.Ahora, respecto a este disco: Graciela es GENIAL! No solamente es una cara bella...es una persona linda con una voz angelical. Recomiendo este disco a todos."
1,To be honest....,"To the last reviewer....LIGHTEN UP! What are you....80? In case you didn't know, people who TRY to sound intellectual, are awfully amusing (ha ha). Anyway...all I know is that Graciela Beltran is hardly an artist. Whenever she is going to perform here, radio DJs make fun of her by asking ""I wonder what she's going to wear this time"", for Beltran has a ghastly taste of clothes! The only time I had the pleasure of seeing her live, she was literally taken off the stage due to the crowds plea. It was at a city festival, and and she was not welcomed at all. Since then, every time I hear her name, I laugh at her inability to win over an audience.....You don't get points for your reviews, Ok india? ha ha"
4,Blues Lover,"If you are a ""true"" Tab Benoit fan this is not what you are looking for. It is, however, a great all around ""Lousiana Blues"" (not cajun) CD. I prefer Tab and Tab alone! Enjoy!!"
5,dye brush,i love this dye brush the price was amazing and it is good for dying hair with i would recommend this dye brush.
2,Not very good quality,"This sleeping bag feels so thin and vulnerable that I sent it back right away. The outer layer isn't attached to the insulation and inner layer, and therefore the inside part of the sleeping bag can twist around: you will find yourself stuck in your sleeping bag...All the fabric feels very thin too. I don't recommend this bag for outdoor camping if you want it to last long. Maybe it is good as an extra sleeping bag at home for sleepovers?I bought a North Face Dolomite instead and are much more happy with that purchase. So spend a little more money and get a decent quality sleeping bag."
4,Franklin Sports 3947 Badminton Set,"Prompt delivery. Packaging intact. Set up fairly easy and straightforward however Sports R Us describing the two enclosed shuttlecocks as ""A Grade"" is an absolute joke. On looking at them they are inferior quality and after setting up the court we had approximately 30 seconds of play. Upon serving the shuttlecocks the red tops came off and got lost rendering them useless. One might think that Franklin would probably glue or meld the tops to them rather than just placing the heads on. Such assembly makes them useful only for display purposes and not for playing with (which is really the point!). Franklin would be better off not including shuttlecocks for all the good these are. If purchasing this set be sure to buy a good set of shuttlecocks separately at the same time to enable play. A let down to an otherwise good deal."
2,Polite - but boring,"This album carries lovely tunes, and is the kind that makes great background music, perhaps to fall asleep to or to drink to and feel depressed, but ultimately, there is little that is original or interesting about it. Song for song, this album simply sucks. Isobel's voice is wan and thinnish, which works at first but becomes boring and repetative over time. The one exception here is Willow's Song, which is such a beautiful song (althought not written by her) that I was blown away. This may be my favorite song so far of the year. It is really ethereal and just takes you to another place. Download it and be done with this album."
2,weak metal bends,"I was dissappointed when my son told me he wasn't using the dragon key cahin due to the metal ""clip"" area being weak."
3,Worked nice for a while than broke...,I really did like this keychain. Too bad that after a while the bend part wore and broke. I'm just glad when it happened my keys were hanging inside my purse so they weren't lost.
5,Good old 50's,"Though there are much monaural recording records, in U.S.A., I am made to be surprised to be different from Japan.I that there seemed to be the person who said have heard that monaural recording was good."
5,M.I.A.M.I is HOT,"I've been waiting for this CD to come forever, and it was worth the wait. Pitbull has been the most overlooked artist in the south for years now and it's about time he got some recognition. If you don't have M.I.A.M.I. yet, go cop that ish, because it is a problem. Aaaayyyoooooo."
5,M.I.A.M.I,Pit's finally here. M.I.A.M.I is hot! If you liked the first national single Culo get this album. If you didn't like Culo get this album cause Culo is probably the worst track on the cd. And everyone needs to watch out cause Miami's goin from the bottom to the top!
3,Pitbull Cuban's CD has great beats !,"This is a decent CD due to the beats. The lyrics aren't all that fly but hey, it is his 1st CD, hopefully he will get better with time. The best songs on the joint are ""Dammit Man"" and ""I Wonder"". I think he will come into his own as an artist eventually. Once again, a CD that is only good for beats..lyrically, he needs to have Fat Joe or Jay-Z ghost write for him so that it can be a better CD all around."
4,This cd aint nasty,"Man Pitbull goes off on this cd, great production, good lyrics and with songs like 305 anthem, Culo, Dammit man, thats nasty and back up makes this cd well worth the money. I cant wait for his new cd to come out in April.Flit"
5,HOT HOT HOT,"This CD is sick. 90% of this CD is worth every penny i paid. Pitbull came in strong with 305 Anthem. He could have left both Culo and the Culo remix off of the ablum and give them to somebody who actually likes them. The other hot tracks are Dammit Man, Dirty, We Dont Care, Hurry Up and Wait, Melting Pot and the Thats Nasty remix with Fat Joe. All long as Pitbull stays with Lil Jon he will be the hottest Cuban rapper out there. NOW THATS NASTY"
4,Good Rhythmic Attitude!,"this cd is tight, there is a bucket load of hot beats, and a huge virity of diffrent sounds from the cumban rapper PitBull. This cd was produced by lil jon, and of course any beats by lil jon are hot, so if your a true rap fan, go out and get this cd. it is off the hook."
1,No Stars For Lack Of Lyrics On His Album,Pitbull's M.I.A.M.I. Album was mostly writen by his producersso that miami's Trick Daddy won't be the only M.I.A. rapper in the game. so Pitbull proves he writes some with the help of his staff at TVT Records And Who I'am is no one's concern. Thank You.
2,what is he doing,on damnit man HE TOOK THAT BEAT FROM CINCINNATI IT'S CALLED DOWN THE WAY WHEN I HEARD THAT SONG A COUPLE YERAS AGO I SAID !!WHAT!!! THIS MEXICAN OR SPANISH MAN IS FAKE
5,"He should put ""Hurry Up And Wait"" on the radio","I liked his album. He should come out with more singles though because his songs are good enough to be on the radio. I loved the song ""Hurry Up And Wait"" though. That was slick!"
5,APHOGEE Balancing Moisturizer Improves Shine & Manageability,Good product it does what it says. Use after Aphogee step 2 treatment and you have better results.
3,Strong scent but works,The scent is not bad but really strong. Gave me a slight headache. It does work well after the protein treatment but I wouldn't say it totally balanced and moisturized. My hair still felt a little dry but that is usual for me after a protein treatment.
1,balancing moisturizer,this did not moisturize my hair at all. its even worst than a conditioner? :/ when i washed it out it felt dry! my hair didnt feel moisturized at alll :( this speaking from a chinese asian hair type.
2,Contains Mineral Oil,I have ethnic hair so therefore mineral oil is not good for my hair. It's a good thing I read the ingredients before use. I love the leave in conditioner.
4,good product,"The balancing moisture has an awesome smell to it. I brought this product along with the Pro Leave in Conditioner, Shampoo, Two Minute ReConst. Conditioner, and Green/Tea Hair Spray. This product was recommended for ladies who have colored hair (highlighted, bleached, died). I am an African American lady with natural hair (meaning no perm/relaxer) with honey blonde highlights; and since these highlights my hair has seen to become more dry then usual. I use this product immediately after Shampoo, and Deep conditioning the hair just to make sure it brings back the life and the moisture in my hair from the color and etc. I highly suggest this product along with the whole line. Great Investment if you are really interested in taking care of your hair. If you dont believe me Youtube the line, and ladies will provide real life testimonies of hair growth & thickness from using the APHOGEE product line."
1,Complete Waste of Money & time,"This is the first time in a long time I have to give a thumbs down to a DVD. The Actors and Actress' were third rate, the Plot was from Nowhere, to me it was a Complete waste of Energy, Producing this Trash. Thank You T.J."
1,Worst piece of junk!,This is trash. No writing! No directing! And worst of all NO ACTING! These people shouldn't quit their day jobs!
1,There's a reason you've never heard of this movie,There is not enough space to cover all of the bad things about this movie
5,Jam-packed with info on how to collect big cash benefits,"This book tells you how to collect social secutity, business loans, educational benefits, grants, pensions, home and farm loans and much more including how to get FREE health and other info that would cost a fortune if you could buy it elswhere. Thanks to the easy to follow information in this book, I now collect a nice monthly a pension due to a disability. I hesitate to recommend the book in fear that too many people will get on the gravy train like I have. Oh what the heck. If you buy this book it will probably be the best investment you ever made."
1,Save your money,"Cheaply, very very cheaply made. Luckily I had the box to send it back-I realize you don't get much for 12 bucks these days, but basically this was not workable. Plastic slot theory of holding dividers in place is just that, theory. Oh well-live and learn."
2,Disappointment,"Before this dvd came out, it said that there was going to be a full live show, all of their videos and a ton of bonus footage spanning their whole 15 years as a band. While the bonus footage and interviews were well done, there are no videos in sight. The setlist was so short and the last song listed on the back of the case is not on the dvd. The All Night Lights was played for close to 5 seconds, then it cuts to the studio track and shows abunch of fans while it says the band member's names... just like in the beginning. Since this is my fav. 36 song, I was really looking forward to it. I dont understand why they would have paid to have it filmed and the sound taken off the soundboard and mastered, and not use it. It makes no sense. This product just seemed rushed and poorly put together."
5,Pinoy rock's salvation!,"In 2004, Bamboo Mañalac picked up where he left off. Arguably the best male singer of the last decade, he and three other talented musicians recorded this breakthrough CD and the rest is history. If you love pure, straight-up Pinoy rock, get this!"
5,Barbra's Greatest Hits in one Piano Book,"This book is a must have for anyone looking for a PIANO BOOK of Barbra Streisand's Greatest Songs! The Yentyl Medley is Great! Anyone looking for a ONE book with all of Barbra's Best songs in it, this is it!"
1,"should have said it was sheet music,not a book written by St","Thought it was a book on the concert,especially when said was written by Streisand-it was sheet music-and she did not write the songs"
1,Amazon sent a European version of this toner - DOESN'T WORK,"Be aware of the different types of toners that Konica-Minolta sells for the 2400W. 'Type AM' is the American version that is to be sold in the states. 'Type EU' is the European version of this toner, and it DOES NOT work in an American printer.I ordered two different color toner carts and both of them were Type EU (I live in the US). They cause continual errors with the printer, and none of the status monitors work. I would think that Amazon (being in the US, shipping to a US address) would be smart enough to stock toners that actually work in the US. Obviously they got a good deal on the European toners, and didn't do the research as to whether or not they would work.Hopefully they fix their stock issues soon."
4,"Great item, great idea, bad paint and brush.","This is a great product! Very creative and encourages your children to save money. Mine couldn't wait for the paint to dry to start putting coins into the piggy bank.However, the paint and paintbrush provided are not good enough to do the job with, so invest in some proper paint, brushes and possibly glaze if you want to keep your work."
2,"Great bank, poor paint","We bought one of these for our two year old daughter for christmas last year. It was great, the paint was excellent and it was a fun project for her. Well that one fell off the shelf and the toy store no longer carried these. So we looked on amazon and came across this one. Compared to the first one the paint is dull and the colors were awful. Nothing like the first one. Also this one feels lighter, like it is made a little cheaper. I don't know if they changed sometime in the last year, but I would not buy this kind ever again."
2,oink oink bank is a big stinker,"I don't know if the paint was somewhat dried out but it was terrible. We had to mix water into the paint to make it spreadable. And there was no where near enough for consistent coverage of any one color. I didn't expect this to be the same quality as going to the ""paint your own ceramic place where they kiln fire your items"" but it really was inferior. My 5 yr old was very excited by it but was disappointed in the paint. and if i have to go buy new paint and everything like another reviewer suggested, I may as well go to the ceramic place and make one there."
5,A beautiful text,"A beautiful text of mainstream statistics, starting from scratch and taking you clearly to a good standard. If it provided answers to exercises, it would be perfect for self-study. Nevertheless, still amazingly clear without sacrificing the rigour and precision of the maths.This must be the first book for anyone who wants to take on probability and statistics seriously...."
5,durable!,The guitar wall hanger in amazingly strong! I ordered this last year for my husbands stocking stuffer. I was thinking that we could just use it until we got a better one. I don't think we'll need to get anything else! It's actually more attractive than it looks in the picture. I probably need to order a few more!
4,great little speaker,"This is the cutest little speaker. The sound is pretty good for a speaker of this size. I was surprised about the sound quality. It is very good. I use it outside while gardening, washing the car, and barbecuing. I even use it while walking on the park trail. It can't compete with the sound of the cars passing by, but otherwise it is great and I don't have to use my headphones. The charge lasts about 4 hours."
1,BAD IDEA,"I am soooo sorry I purchased this scanner. All it did was totally mess up my Dell system. I had to hire a computer technician to undo all the damage and hidden files, and drivers that this item came with. I've used Visioneer before, with no problem. This one was a lemon. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the scanning light could not be recalibrated."
1,BE CAREFUL,"Be VERY careful when purchasing anything from Visioneer. I own a visioneer One Touch 9220, and just learned they have NO intention of providing a driver for VISTA. Not only that, I had to PAY to learn that. Their corporate greed exceeds belief. If you think you might, someday in the future, be upgrading your computer, I would have to suggest buying some other scanner"
2,Looks nice on the outside...,"...But the workings on the inside leave a lot to be desired. I bought two of these, the first sending back because it left scan lines consistantly throughout the scan, no matter how high the resolution was set. Thinking I had a faulty product, I simply exchanged it. The second one did the same thing! I was very disappointed in the quality of the scans, and don't recommend this scanner for anyone who is half-way serious about quality. I have a photo restoration and manipulation business, and this scanner doesn't cut it by a long shot. Serious scanners... stay away! Buy something else (like a CanoScan 8600F) that is a big bang for your buck within this price range. Better yet, if you can afford a more expensive machine, just remember that you really do get what you pay for!"
5,Worth the Money--The best towel set we have,"I put this towel on our baby registry thinking it was cute. It is much more than just cute. We received about 10 different towels from different friends and this is the BEST one, hands down, that we have. When we have another child, I will purchase more of these. The towel is so soft and extremely absorbent. It is thick and keeps baby warm after getting out of the tub. If I leave him wrapped in it for about 3-5 minutes, almost all of the water is off of his body, which is great because it reduces our need to rub him dry since our baby has sensitive skin and drying him with the other, less absorbent towels seems to irritate his skin a little. This is a GREAT towel and worth the money."
3,Meh. Not for long term use.,"I purchesed this via Amazon a year ago. It has since been thrown in the garbage.It scratched very easily and warped in high temp ovens.I by no means am a commercial baker. It's main uses were for cookies and nachos.It never went under the broiler and the highest temp it saw was maybe 425. Within 6 months it was rendered useless.Warped rather fast, and don't even plan on cutting anything on it because it was scratch and in return pucker in the oven. Oh, and cleaning- NO thanks. This thing was a pain.The price was right so whatever, but honestly the $5 cookie sheets at your local grocer store will hold up longer."
3,The Blue Dog Leash,"My dog Okeem really liked it - he chewed and chewed on it a bit at a time (everytime he got in the car) until he finally ripped it. His teeth are sharp so I would have hoped this to be a bit tougher (they are dog leashes afterall)So quality could be better, comfort and style were a 5 out of 5."
3,"For fun only, please don't take seriously.","I received this book as a gift because I am fascinated by the mentality behind conspiracy theory but I am not into them. I think the only people who would take this book seriously are those who are already mentally dysfunctional and really just looking for an excuse to plant a bomb. If they would'nt find the excuse in this book then they would surely find it somewhere else. Apart from that this really is just for pure entertainment. It just doesn't have the thoroughness about it which would set it up as one of the more convincing publications on conspiracy theory, not that they are ever very convincing. The only reason I don't give it more stars is because it presents itself as fact instead of comedy fiction. I particularly enjoyed the reveiw of Om Shiva at Bonkersville, Alabama. I laughed more at that than I did at this book and I think it summarises perfectly the mind set with which this book should be digested."
3,fun reading,"These two men look normal and speak normally, which is more than can be said of most Bible prophecy people - just read the other two reviews!!!! Their book is interesting and makes a good case for the present time being the ""end times"" - however, only time will tell if they are accurate."
1,boring yet dumb,"This book is a combination of garden-variety technology reporting (the sort of ""what will they think of next"" stuff you read in USA today: these guys more or less know what they are talking about) and far-out predictions, but unfortunately the predictions aren't far out or paranoid enough to be really amusing. Sure, we all know that people watch too much TV these days and that these are amazing times to be alive... But...After the rapture, people won't be surprised because they will naturally assume all these people have been beamed up by Scotty?Virtual Reality is the best tool the anti-christ has? (Somebody tell these guys that VR is passe these days.)Other than that it's all pretty tame stuff..."
3,"""Are You Ready?"" heh","I bet this book ain't sellin' to hot right about now. All these new technologies and lightning-fast changes? at one point, people were afraid of telephones too. Don't mind me though, this might look nice next that other bestselling work of f.. oh, i'll just stop right there. I'm sorry.. i just get a kick out of the title.Excuse me, someones at the door."
4,Great for small areas of skin,"I love the California Baby sunblock for use on my baby because it is a barrier sunscreen and does not have chemicals that absorb into the skin. However, I would recommend using the kind that squeezes out like a lotion to cover most of the skin. This sunblock stick works well for small areas like the face and hands. You have to use a bit of pressure to get it to apply to the skin so you would not want to have to do that all over - it would take forever."
2,Hate the consistency; difficult to apply,"I am not a fan of the CA Baby sunblock stick. I purchased this to use on my young son because it is routinely listed as one of the safest sunblocks on the market. I would recommend sticking with the lotion. The stick sunblock is very difficult to apply, especially to young children who typically don't like things being pressed and scraped on their skin. Following application, you'll then need to vigorously rub it in and even the the weird purplish/white glow doesn't disappear. It got to the point where my son would cry when he would see me take this product out to use on him, so we obviously discontinued using it. I will say that he never got any color while wearing this sunblock, so it does work. But, in the end, the effort just wasn't worth it."
3,Difficult to apply,"I like that this a safe (according to skindeep) sunscreen. It seems to protect my son and did not irritate his skin at all. It is very difficult to apply, it does not spread and I end up having to rub it all over his skin anyway, which he does not enjoy. It is easy to transport and I like having it in the diaper bag for emergencies as it won't make a mess."
2,Why is my son purple?,"This stuff works okay as far as sun protection. We've used it in combination with the Soleo Organics sunscreen. It washes off faster than Soleo, but really does a decent job.However, there are two things I simply can't get over:1--This is terrible to use if you have more than a baby's face to cover. Because it doesn't rub in easily, it takes forever apply. I have to say, the stick made it convenient for getting my baby son's face done while he was squirming, but we don't use it other than that.2--This stuff does not absorb into your skin. It leaves a light purple hue on your face and that stays. Maybe okay if you're going to apply makeup over it, but my husband wasn't too keen on our son walking around with purple makeup face."
1,Showed up old and dried out - can't be used,"I have used this stick many, many times over the years and have always been happy with how it works. I usually buy it at Whole Foods and that's the end of it. Unfortunately, this time I bought it here. It arrived hard and dried out, tough to apply and frankly, doesn't even seem to work well. I contacted the seller but they blamed Amazon and said they can't/won't make it right. Lesson learned. I'll buy it again but never from here or from this crappy seller."
2,Would not buy this again,It leave white streaks and does not glide very easily. The consistency is thick and difficult to apply. I would not recommend it. The only reason I gave it two stars is that is is chemical free.
4,Good for the face and for little kids,"I like this a lot for my fair-skinned kids. We use it mostly for faces, but they enjoy putting it on their bodies themselves (what kid doesn't like rubbing chapstick all over himself?). It does leave a faint white line, especially if you don't take the effort to rub it in; but for normal play that's fine with me and they're too little to care. They've burned wearing Mineral Aveeno, Melaleuca, and Target brand sunscreen - this keeps them from burning and is consistently rated as one of the safest sunscreens for kids. I've used it on my face (rubbed in pretty good, it disappears) and it works for me too."
3,Overall great!,This is a nice book as a reference. The author touches base on seemingly everything but nothing too far in depth. For beginners (which I am) it is very useful and is small enough to carry around without feeling like it's taking up space.
5,Perfect Guide for First-time Backpackers,"My fiancee and I are looking to go backpacking later this year. I purchased this for her for Christmas. I must say, it is very detailed and very helpful. It has already given us ideas that we hadn't even thought of. While I'm sure a group of books might cover more than just this guide, this certainly does seem to be all-inclusive for first-time backpackers like us. It honestly covered more than I thought it would. I'll have to come back and update this review after our first trip - to see if there is anything we might have changed (or added) that were mentioned in this manual. Certainly the food options listed within sound yummy!"
5,Great Guide to Hiking and Camping,"I'm a relatively new ""serious"" backpacker and wanted a lot of detailed information on all aspects of camping and hiking. This book offers the detail I desired and the range of topics that I needed. This should be a necessary part of every backpackers equipment."
5,It has everything.,"I've had some experience in backpacking, but there where some gaps in my knowledge. This book had EVERYTHING that I wanted to know.I purchased this book along with a book on orienteering and another on knots to further add to my expertise. Unfortunately, all the knots (compacted onto two pages) and orienteering tricks that I needed where in this book and I needn't have purchased the others.I've been reading the book straight through. Although it is meant to be carried with you, it isn't pocket sized and has lengthy textual information for most topics including a lot about equipment and preparation. I've memorized all the info I think I'll need and won't be carrying it.The two star reviewer complained about this book's lack of depth into any topic, but as for me, I backpack only a few times a year but car camp and hike once a month or more and this book had everything I think I'll ever need to know aside from specific equipment suggestions."
3,holy cow!,"While this is a well written book, it is a bit excessive. the author goes way to in depth and discusses processes that 90% of backpackers wouldnt even consider doing. it is more like a technical manual for a F-16 rather than a book of pointers to imporove your backpacking experience."
2,Broad but not deep,"This book is crammed full of information on a wide variety of backpacking topics, from weather forcasting to group dynamics, however it goes into very limited detail about each one.It is in my oppinion a good resource for the inexperienced.Anyone that already has a good deal of backcountry savy would be better off getting more specialized information on select topics they wanted to know more about."
4,"Great book, but riddled with typos",This is a great book for anyone looking to get into backpacking or as a reference is the field for the seasoned trekker. The book contains plenty of up to date information covering almost everything you would need to know. The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is just stacked full of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors. A couple even in sections giving you numeric statistics and info. Apart from that... awesome book!
5,best product,"i love this thing its everything you could wish for the color,sound everything `s beautiful"
3,a lot like grumpy old men.,"A grown son and his old man. He has to go fishing. this is the U.P. of Michigan and all the rabid fisher folk are out no matter the weather. This is ice fishing, shacks and a monster Pike??? that needs to be caught.There are rabid snowmobilers,monster truck guys, and a wife who does not know her husband (who cried off sick,from her mom's birthday celebration.) has taken her car to the lake in order to fish. All kinds of mishaps occur, but it all works out in the end. I have always liked Borgnine, but this looks to be a made for t.v. flick, and the production is not of the quality of a full length film. It is family approved, so language, and action are all very mellow. Definately suitable for the whole family to view."
1,Not worth it!!,The quality was way less than what I expected (even though I've purchased Xhilaration products before); and these shoes were VERY uncomfortable! I am returning these shoes and will not be purchasing shoes made by Xhilaration again.
2,Entertaining,"This book has some entertainment value. It's full of stories that involve some kind of flirting. However, the title is a little misleading. This is not a book I would reccommend to learn how to flirt. It really doesn't teach flirting. It gives some ideas about possible flirting situations, but doesn't deliver the goods on flirting. I gave two stars for that reason. But it isn't a bad book and is a fun read. If the title was ""Lucky in Love - 52 Flirting Stories..."" then I would have given it more stars, but I think most people, like me are buying it to learn how to flirt."
1,Don't waste your money,The tape came unstuck and it landed on the hiway.. A car behind me ran over it.. so it was trashed.. I would not recommend this product because on the corners you have to cut little pieces of tape to make the tight turn.. I think that is how air got underneath of mine and blew it off the car..
3,Most br00tal music you will ever hear,"This is by far the most brutal music you will ever hear in your life. ""Pandemonic Hyperblast"" is widely considered to be the loudest, most brutal song in existance. If you like this kind of stuff, then go for it. Although I personally prefer ""tamer"" stuff such as Dimmu Borgir and Arch Enemy, this black/death metal release no doubt has it's followers."
5,Sabbath's Music Lends Itself Perfectly To This Tribute,"Black Sabbath's music lends itself so perfectly to this kind of a tribute, you can't help but think maybe Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill planned this from the beginning. Not likely, but still. This is one of the most natural sounding String Tributes out there. The slow, plodding, doom-like riffs translate amazingly to a string quartet. Check out the sound clips of Electric Funeral and Iron Man for the best examples. Even Paranoid was impressive, and that's not really a song you would expect to translate very well. In all, a great pickup Ozzy & Sabbath fans, both old and new."
4,Just read...,Pahrak-Kal is just another version of Pahrak. ... if you just like to collect. Nothing new same old toy... This is for people who like to create custom guys: He has the only source for the Brown bohrok arms to date... otherwise he is pretty much useless besides the silver hip joints and hand sheilds...If you are looking for something for a son or daughters birthday get something else. Go and search for Panrahk. He is better and more poseable... ...!-ZS-
2,3rd edition of antique golf collectibles,"Purchased this book to gain some insight to the world of golf collectables, this book has all of the categories, just is horribly incomplete, the Tiger Woods section seemed a bit inapropriate for an antiques book. Sorry I wasted my money, cannot give it too a freind as I think it junk, Goodwill wil be getting another crummy bbook donated."
1,"Do not buy - great looks, but stops working after a while","I first got this watch as a gift from very dear friends. After a while, it stopped working, or it would work on and off. I had it fixed (don't know how or what was wrong), and after a while lost it. I got another copy of the same watch - and now having the exact same problem again (stops working, even with brand new battery). This surely can't be a coincidence. Something is wrong with this model."
5,Easy and easy,"wow do my greens tast different now that I'm not churning them in a blender but really making ""juice"". Love this product. I don't know how it could be any easier. While it's got nothing to do w/ the product, there is a lot of pulp left that I wish I knew how to use. Hate to throw so much of it out, but I've gotten the best portion from it with the ""juice"". Easy to clean and a cinch to use!"
3,"Ok, but pricey","I read all of the reviews and decided that this would be the best juicer even if it was quite a bit more money. It works great but doesn't meet the hype of some of the reviews. A friend has a $50 juicer that does just as good a job IMO. Considering the amount of vegetables it takes to make the juice, spend less on the juicer so you have more to spend on the vegetables and fruits."
5,LOVE IT!!,It's easy to use. I simply love it. My teens and I are having a great time making all kinds of juices. I haven't began using vegetables yet but excited about that as well. So far so good for the first week
5,Great juicer ! Made my life much healthier !,"Had a simple user before, but that one was hard to clean, and got barely juice out of it. This one is great! Easy to use, easy to clean, and gives great juices! Use it for vegetables as well as many different fruits: beet roots, kale, carrots, rhubarb, cucumber, celery, pears, apples, oranges, strawberries, blackberries, etc, etc, never get bored with making uses 1-3 times a week. Make normally about a half to a gallon a time, put it in the fridge, and use it for 1-2 days. Really happy with it. Was inspired after the 'movie': fat, sick and nearly dead. Not that I was close to that condition, but it inspired me to buy a better juicer, and go for it! See my other reviews for a great juicer book, and jars to store the juice. Made my life much healthier!"
5,Excellent Product!!!!!!!!!,"Wow, is all I can say. This thing literally turns the fruit and veg into sawdust and the result is a huge yield of juice. I love the adjustable speed and the quality of construction. I learned with this product that you get what you pay for, in other words spend a little more money on this product rather than buying the cheaper ones. Very satisfied!"
5,Very Good,"Awesome Product .. Most Importantly, its very very easy to clean either manually or thru a dishwasher.A Highly recommended ""Must Buy"" product"
5,so far so good but.....,we bought this less than a week ago and have only used it a few times so far but it's been great. very powerful and a lot quieter than our old juiceman which sounded like an airplane engine compared to the breville. the only issue we've had is that every time we have juiced it's leaked a little on the sides and drips down which is a little annoying.when u put it together it seems sealed pretty well but obviously not. cleaning is always gonna be a slight pain but this one is pretty easy. just rinse and you're done. if it keep leaking we might take it back and exchanging it for another one. also the speed dial is cool but we've just been using it on speed #5. having to adjust the dial for every different fruit or vegetable u use can be a pain.
5,Love it!,Well worth the money. I have only used it a few times but it works great and makes fabulous juice. I can't wait to juice some veggies to include in some soup for the family. They will never know they are eating veggies
4,"Breville Juicer - Made in China, but ok.","It's made in china, and not worth the price, but it seems to be built ok. it doesn't quite pulp all the product and will spit out skins. Pulp is dry, so it's doing it's job. 2 apples will make a 8 oz glass of juice, and 20 baby carrots will make 1/4 cup. It's a chore to clean, and disassemble, 5 pieces to wash. It's only got a year warranty, so use it hard that first year."
1,Very disappointed,"I am very disappointed with my newly purchased Breville juicer. While it is sturdy, easy to operate and clean, all very important issues, the most critical for me is the very thing it is supposed to do. The real quality of a juicer ultimately is how much extraction of juice takes place. I am a long time juicer and lost parts of my old reliable juicer during a move. In desperation I purchased the Breville, impressed by its solid construction. After three days of juicing however, I'm returning it. The pulp extracted is seeping with juice and this morning the parsley I juiced came out with whole pieces some 1 inch long that have only been cut and not extracted at all. The vegetables I juice are always organic and I feel like I'm throwing way too much expensive and valuable juice away in the pulp. I can't believe that all these people think this is such a fabulous juicer. Maybe they aren't paying attention to the waste created."
3,Breville BJE510XL Ikon 900-watt juice extractor,"Bigger than I would have liked it to be, juices really well but takes alot of vegetables to make juice. Okay in the summer when fresh vegetables are cheaper to get but don't see me using it in the winter because it would cost me to much money to use"
4,Saving me money in the long run,"I'm sorry Odawaala - I know I haven't called but I'm getting my juice somewhere else. Your prices were way too high for juice extracted who knows when. Now that the Ikon 510XL has entered my life I won't go back to over-priced/processed store bought juice ever again. There's nothing like going to the local farmers market getting the best seasonal produce and experimenting with all the flavor combinations (always look online before drinking anything straight, for example, never drink pure beet juice. [...] is a good free resource to help). Now if only Breville could make a self cleaning model..."
4,Works well but feed chute is too sharp to clean by hand,I liked everything about this juicer except for the feed chute. It is too sharp to clean it with hand. Jack La Lenne has a nice feature to stop the juice from dripping (in case the glass is full). Adding that feature and making the feed chute less sharp will make this a [erfect juicer for me
1,"Looks and feels like nice quality, but died after 10 seconds","Ran for about 10 seconds, then it died. Breville customer service said to make sure the locking handle is in place (check) and try unplugging it and then plug it back in (check). No love. I'm so disappointed."
1,poor yeild,"Uses alot of fruit veggies to get any amount of juice, doesnt juice leafy veggies at all, pain in arse to take apart and clean, screen clogs easy and impossible to keep clean, variable speed seems to make no difference on what ur juicing. Been using it daily but would not purchase again"
5,Perfect Juicer,"Free Amazon shipping but delivered to my door within 24 hours! I've been using this for just a couple of days but I'm really impressed. Nice design, looks sturdy. Nothing left on the pulp. Great juicer!!!"
5,Breville Ikon 900 Watt Juicer,"I am very pleased with this juicer. Powerful motor, easy to use as well as assemble and clean.Multiple speeds and splash gaurd are also nice features. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality juicer."
5,Everything Works & Delivers as Advertized,"I did a lot of research as to which juicer was the best value for the money. Without question this has proved the BEST. It cleans easy, and it is fun to blend your own blend of herbs, vegetables, fruits, etc. The book was fun to start with, but buy what is in season or what is ripe and may be tossed by the store. The power is awsome and is an appliance that is a pleasure to use.We use it every day.JRA"
4,Exactly what I wanted,"I'm amazed at how well this meets my needs, what a great job it does, and the easy cleanup. It is so easy to use I have been juicing at least 1 to 2 times a day! So far, it's handled every type of fruit/vegetable I've tried and the results are delicious. I save the pulp in a freezer bag and deliver it to my good friend for her compost pile so nothing goes to waste. I'm very satisfied and hope it lasts a long time."
5,Sweet,"The juicer looks great and does what it is supposed to do. Check out the dimentions as it is larger than I envisioned. You need ample storage space but it's so good looking it can be left on the counter, Cleaning takes some time but the smooth parts rinse and wash well. The basket/strainer brush that is provided cleans the basket well. I found that the OXO bottle brush is the perfect thing for cleaning all of the parts well.I never used a juicer before but the controls are self explanitory. Careful, it splashes a bit when adding soft foods. Be ready with the stopper."
2,Breville BJE510XL Ikon 900-Watt Juicer,I was disappointed to find that I could still wring out juice from the overly wet pulp when it was done. I thought I did my research but found a lower price juicer (different brand) to be better. I sent this one back. I think the screen holes that the juice is supposed to go through are too small. I tried different speed settings when juicing and that didn't make a difference. Would not recommend this product.
2,Good while it works,"I love the design of this juicer and the ease in assembly. I love that the feed tube is wide enough that you don't have to cut up apples and medium sized fruit. I like the different power settings so you can juice hard fruits and soft fruits at different speeds. Unfortunately, the machine stopped working after 3 juicings. The LCD lights came on but nothing happened when you pressed the on/off switch. I returned it to Amazon and got a refund. I have re-ordered it because I like the power and I hope that I just got a lemon the first time. But I will be keeeping the box this time, just in case."
3,where is the juice?,"It looks beautiful and looks great on my counter,but I had a Jack La Lane juicer and after 12 years it died, I wanted something new, I juice every day the same amount of fruit and veggies, this juicer does not give me the amount of juice that the other one did, it discard's a lot of pulp with juice in it, I acctually could squeezed out with my hands, I expected a more advanced and better product and was very disapointed, that after all these years the old ones still do a better job than the new ones"
4,Overall satisfied,Been using this product for a year now. Overall we are happy with it. Only thing we have noticed is the mesh can get clogged depending on what you are juicing. You have to stop and rinse it out or the motor starts smelling like it is overheating. But that fine mesh is what keeps the pulp out so I'm not sure that could be remedied. It is good and sturdy and does the job well.
1,juices well...BUT...,bought this last March (beyond year warranty)...juicer works well...BUT...the juicer collector cracked in two places. It's impossible to use now because it leaks everywhere and I can't purchase a replacement because Breville is out of stock...what a mess.
5,Great!,This is my first juicer and it's amazing so far. Easy to clean and easy to use. Definitely recommend!
3,Good but fragile,Eventhough one plastic part did break within the first 4days I like the juicer. Amazon offered to return and reorder the product - what I personally find very inconvinient since the big package is very uncomfortable to carry around and sending a small plastic part would have been much easier... Still I would give the product a 3.5 star rating.
1,Buy this juicer at your own risk,"Does this juicer honestly work for other people? I read the previous review about the circuit breaking when overloaded-- and yes, that happens and then the juicer doesn't work . . . at all. We sent the first one back after using it for a couple of months and got another. Now after one month the second one quit working even though we were extra careful in not overloading the motor.The manufacturer needs to fix the design flaw- there are too many other juicers out there that don't have this problem. It is definitely not worth the risk."
4,good juicer for the money,"I bought this juicer to juices mainly vegetables. It is a good juicer for the money. Since this is my first juicer, I didn't want to spend $350. This Breville doesn't juice greens as well as I'd hoped but it seems like you'd need an expensive masticating juicer to do that. I like the wide feed tube...it makes for quick juicing. It is easy to clean as long as you do it right away. It is loud...but so is our coffee grinder!"
5,Great item!,"We have recently decided to change our eating habits and eat more fresh foods. Juicing was one of our changes. This is our first juicer and we just love this product! For us, it seems to squeeze all the juice out of the fruits and vegetables we process. We have done carrots, apples, celery, spinach, beets, grapes, and more.The other thing I like about this juicer is that it is easy to clean. We don't have a dishwasher so we clean it by hand washing. The cleaning process is so easy - we couldn't have asked for a better juicer, especially for our first time trying the process!Great product!!"
4,Nice product,"I can't stand eating vegetables so I decided to give juicing a try. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of this machine, very nice. First juice I made was a simple apple, carrot and cucumber mix. Used one apple, a handful of baby carrots and about 4 slices of cucumber. All of that gave me plenty of juice. Tasted great! The waste in the waste container was very dry so I know I got the most juice possible. Only con I can think of so far is the price... Little pricey, but i suppose no juicer is cheap. Enjoy!"
4,My first juicer...I like it!,"This is my first time juicing and this is my first juicer. I am pleased with this product. It seems to work the way it should. Set up was fairly easy, and clean up is not bad. My family is now drinking healthy ""green juice"" with apples, spinach, kale, celery and cucumbers...we love it!"
4,Breville 510XL,"I love this juicer! It is well made, and powerful enough to juice most anything.The Breville juices quickly and cleanup is very easy, except for the the grinder/strainer basket.It is hard to get the screen clean from the pulp. Although, I am sure most juicers screens are hard to clean as well. Overall I am very happy with the purchase."
3,Breville BJE510XL,"I read all of the reviews & must agree with everything that was written. It was a great juicer easy to set up, juce anything you threw at it, wide mouth so you could drop in small apples whole carrots. Beets needed to be cut but they are very hard. BUT notice I said WAS after a year of average jucing we juiced apples & pears one day cleaned the unit & put it up the next time it was set up it would not work. The warrenty had just run out Breville's coustermer NO service wouldn't even discuss the matter, So I took it to a small applience repair service & was given the old it would be less expencive to replace than to repair! If this unit were half the price I would replace it with with another Breville but I am looking at less expenseve juicers because if one year is the life of the unit why spend the money after all 75.00 will buy a unit that will do about the same thing for the same duration. Sorry Breville I won't be back!!!"
5,Breville 900 Watt Juicer,"We bought this juicer for a 3 day juice fast. It is very user friendly. Just cut up the fruit so it will fit in the tube (which is big enough to handle half an apple), adjust the dial to the appropriate speed for the fruit or veggie you're juicing, and in seconds your juice is ready. Perfect!There are no complicated parts. Everything fits together and comes apart with ease. Clean up is a breeze, just throw all the removable parts in soapy water or the dishwasher and you're done. We use it so frequently that most of the time we just spray it off with the sink sprayer and let it air dry on the counter. We are very happy with this purchase. Don't be fooled by the cheaper models in the stores, the ease of daily use is worth every penny."
1,worked great for one month,"This was a great product when it was first bought. Looked good on the counter top and performed well, then the motor stopped working after one month of use. Now the display just shows an ""E"" when it's turned on.What a disappointment."
2,8 months and on the fritz,"i love juicing. i juice daily for my family. however after 8 mos. of daily use, the filter/mesh part is coming apart from the funnel. i don't juice the cores of apples or pears, but i do juice lemons & grapefruit with the seeds in it. i called for a replacement part and it costs $65 plus shipping. Quite an Expensive part. I do not recommned this model. Before this model, i had an a juicer that lasted 5 yrs that is no longer available."
5,lOVE THIS jUICER!,"After spending a lot of time ready all the reviews, I was a bit nervous as this a lot of $$ to spend and some of them spoke of motors burning out etc. I knew for sure that I was going to buy from AMAZON since they make returns so easy.But not to worry at all...from the first time I used it I just love it, easy to use & clean.My sister has the bigger juicer, but since it does not fit under any kitchen cabinet in her kitchen & decided to go for the smaller model."
5,a great juicer,This is my first juicer so I dont have much to compare to but I cannot say anything negative about it. I have had it for about a month. I juice almost everyday. It works greats and looks great on my counter.
5,Love it,Easy to disassemble and clean. Fairly quiet and very fast to process food. Like the 5 speed to accomodate the different fruit and vegetable consistencies. Makes my beginning venture into juicing a positive and desirable experience. Would definitely recommend it!
5,Breville Juice Extractor,"It is my first time to use a juice extractor and I love it! After 2 weeks of use, I found this product to be well designed and durable. It is very easy to clean. The variable speed adjustment is what makes it a better juicer when juicing a variety of fruits."
5,Very nice machine,"This is a great juicer. The ergonomics are first class. The juice spout is perfectly placed, not too low and the container that comes with the juicer is excellent. The variable speeds are perfect for doing different types of fruits and vegetables. Seems to be well made and is quiter in operation than our previous juicer, a JuiceMan. Worth the money. We shouldn't have to buy another juicer for a long time to come."
2,Juicer,"Its good for juicing, but too much work in cleaning.Wish can use for blending food as well.It takes up too much space on counter. Wish I could exchange for another better one"
2,Get More Juice From Jack La Lanne Juicer for Half the Cost,I own both this model and the Jack LaLanne Juicer. I get much more juice for the same batch of veggies from the LaLanne juicer. The Breville spins too fast (even at slowest speed) and waste too much....giving too little juice. Dont waste your money...buy a cheaper one first.
5,Family Juicer,"My family asked for a juicer so I broke down and got Breville BJE510XL Juicer 900 watt.which were referred by my Brother Gregory and now I am the queen juicer, my family buy more fruits than ever now , which taste so good ,I mean I forgot about manufactured juice,which I were turning away from manufactured juices because of the awful taste and all of the additives , now I know what's in my family juice when they drink it pure natural 100%!"
5,all-around great juicer,"this is my first juicer, so i don't have anything to compare it to. that being said, i have no complaints so far. the variable-speed is a really nice feature for juicing different types of produce. it is easy to take apart and cleaning is not bad. the motor is plenty powerful, and chews through everything i've put in it just fine. i dropped the top piece on the floor this morning and it didn't break or crack, this unit seems to be built really well, nice and sturdy. i looked at a lot of different products for my first purchase and for the price, this seemed to be the best bang for your buck.great product!"
5,So easy to use!,"After reading all of the reviews, I decided on the Ikon as it had the power for a more moderate price. I wanted a machine that would last and be able to handle all types of veges and fruit. I am very satisfied with the purchase. The juicer handles itself very well. Cleaning is a snap! We bought another for our parents!"
1,Never Again,The unit worked for 10 minutes out of the box and died. Had a bad smell. So I went with a cheaper one Jack LaLayne's and am much happier because it has been working well for weeks....
5,liquid pleasure!,"we thought we had a juicer, then we fired our Breville and we KNEW we had a juicer... if you aint never have, yaotta might wanna do... make ya feel betta!"
1,Going back for a refund,"It arrived yesterday. I went and bought $100 worth of veggies and was ready to go. Washed all the parts, put it together, got the led display, hit the on button and nothing. It's a POS. Going to go buy a Jack LaLanne."
4,Very Pleased and well made,"My Breville Juicer arrived yesterday and I have used it three times already. Very well made and I am pleased with the results of the juice it extracts. The pulp was on the dry side so it is working like it should. Yes, there are many pieces to clean but I just rinsed everything and put into hot soapy water to soak while I sipped my juice so the cleaning to me was not a big deal. Also, I do not find it that loud, my coffee grinder and cuisinart are much louder. Amazon shipped on time and all is good. The reviews here really helped me make a good choice."
5,Hooked on my Breville,"I used my juicer for the first time this morning and I'm hooked!! I'm the type of person that doesn't eat veggies at all. I don't mind how they taste, but I hate the consistency when I chew them. I woke up a little earlier this morning and prepped some carrots and apples. The Breville is so easy to use! There was more juice than I was expecting. Cleaning was super easy. Everything comes apart and they are all large easy to clean pieces. I love my Breville so much that I'm getting one for my mom on her birthday. You can't miss with this one guys! Happy juicing!!"
4,Great Juicer,I received this for a wedding gift and liked it so much bought one for my mother for her birthday. It has a very sleek design and easily assembled components. The speed dial for different fruits/vegetables is handy. I found it was best to go slowly when adding ingredients so as not to overburden the motor.
1,was a bust for me,"received a brand new one as a gift a few years ago. Had a champion and an acme so I didn't even take it out of the box. When I did take it out of the box, it did not work--in fact it smoked when I turned it on and then quit. Was going to juice some apples. Of course the warranty had expired and of course the nearest service center is 2,500 miles from my home! Of course Breville claims they do not have a service manual for it (can you believe that? they brushed me off with a list of service centers that was not current) they can sell you. So before you buy one, be sure they have a service center nearby and try it out as soon as you get it. Otherwise you are screwed like I am. Oh yes, you can buy a brand new Breville juicer cheaper than you can buy the motor!"
5,Great Juicer,I bought this item on a recommendation of a friend. I am new to juicing and wanted to make a purchase on something easy to use and tough enough to handle volume.I am very impressed with this juicer and this brand. I am now looking to purchase to a blender from Breville as well.
2,Not good enough,"I have an older Jack LaLanne Power Juicer, and I thought the Breville would be a nice upgrade. Eh... not so much. The Breville left far more pulp in the juice and it leaked and splashed more juice than I could believe. Messy! I ran batches of veggies and fruit through both of them, and easily decided to stick with my Jack LaLanne Power Juicer. I returned the Breville."
2,Juicer,Purchased this product to begin the new year 2013 juicing. It works okay not the best. My pulp is really wet and I feel like I am waisting a lot of produce. If you want dry pulp you may have to spend a little more. Will continue to use as it does the trick just not happy with the wetness of the pulp. Feels like you could squeeze more juice out.
4,I like this juicer!!,This is a great juicer. The pulp is pretty dry when you take it out. It is also easy to clean. I make my juice and then clean the machine before I drink the juice. The cleaning take about 2 to 3 minutes. I clean the machine first because then it is super easy to clean. If you wait a while the cleaning is harder because the stuff starts to dry. I mostly just rince between cleanings and just soap occasionally.
5,Amazing juicer!!!!!!,"Please don't buy a Jack LeLane juicer if, in fact, you are a serious health nut. This Breville juicer is the cadillac of juicers!Amazing performance! I love, love, love it!"
5,My new friend,This Breville is so awesome! It's easy to work and a breeze to clean. There are so many Juicers to choose from but if you spend some time investigating you will find there is not one that comes close. 5 stars.
5,love my juicer,"We've been juicing for over a year now. My first juicer was good enough, however since I bought the Breville all I can say is WOW! Read the other reviews.Everything about this juicer is awesome. Clean up is a breeze. You don't have to chop veggies and fruit small, this baby can handle it. And its also fast. And I mean fast.So if you're thinking about purchasing a juicer, this is the one, you won't be disappointed. Finally, the price is comparable to other juicers. Most juicers cost about the same so don't waste your time or money just get the Breville!"
2,Disapppointed,"After seeing the movie ""Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead"" my husband and I decided to try a juice fast. This Breville 900 watt variable-speed juicer worked for us for about a week and then started stopping, starting, stopping. We returned it and had another shipped to us directly from Breville. We opened the box yesterday and when we switched it on for the first time it would barely start - no fruit or veges were in the machine. We tried soft grapes and apricots and the same result: stopping, starting, stopping and then is wouldn't run at all. We are extremely disappointed and are now looking for a different juicer. Maybe the single speed Breville is a better product..? I tried calling Breville customer service but, after being on HOLD for 20 minutes, I gave up."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased this juicer four months ago. After three months, the electrical system developed a problem and the juicer did not function. It was too late to return to Amazon, so I contacted Breville since the juicer is under warranty. After waiting on hold for 30 minutes. I spoke with a customer service representative who agreed to send me a return form so that I could mail my defective juicer and receive a replacement. After four weeks and several phone calls, I have not received a return mailing form.I was happy with my juicer when it work. I am greatly disappointed with the malfunction and the atrocious customer service."
5,Awesome Juicer,This is our first juicer and we couldn't be happier! Am using it 3 times a day and it's great!
2,2 Juicers returned to Amazon,"I ordered he Juicer solely based on Amazon rating. The first one was dead on arrival, sent back to Amazon and they sent a second one right away. It arrived within days. Started juicing and thee machine worked flawlessly. 3 weeks into juicing at least twice a week the machine just decided to stop working. Sent back for a refund."
2,Too much work to clean,"I ordered this after reading many positive reviews. I used the item once and when I discovered that there were 6 pieces that needed to be cleaned, I decided to return it. The amount of work to clean it will make me want to use it less frequently. In addition, the item is quite bulky and takes up a lot of counter space. Also, as pointed out by another reviewer, when you place the food items in the chute, you need to cover it quickly or else food pieces will spatter everywhere. It is very powerful and does a nice job juicing, but the bulkiness and amount of work needed to clean it make it less attractive. I'm going to purchase instead the ninja bullet since it is small, efficient, and easy to clean. Not a juicer, but achieves the same results."
1,It works great! At least the first time.,"My last breville juicer lasted 2 years. It still works fine but the screen thing broke and they dont make a replacement part for my juicer anymore. Besides, that little screen costs about 60$. So I decided to just buy a new juicer the Ikon. It worked wonderfully the first 2 or 3 times I used it, but now it won't power on. I tried everything, taking it apart and putting it together, changing the outlet...but when I plug it in all I see is the light turn on but the motor doesn't start. It worked perfectly fine just yesterday."
3,PULP in vegetable juices!!!,"We make vegetable juice every day and I am a bit sad to report that there is pulp from carrots, spinach, beets (hard vegetables) I have to spend more time sifting the juice to get rid of it, so it will taste its best. We used Jack LaLanne power juicer before, It did not give pulp until it was used for a year and a quarter, we suspect the motor give up. The price for Breville Ikon 900 watt BJE510xl is right, the appearance is great and removable parts are easy to assemble together."
5,Great Product,Received our Breville Ikon Juicer and we absolutely LOVE it! We have been juicing for 3 weeks and the juicer works flawlessly! It meets and exceeds our expectations! We're very pleased with our juicer and feel like we made the perfect choice!
5,Awesome!,"I love the product! ever since i got it, i can't stop juicing! i juice everything and the machine is awesome! Thanks breville!"
3,"Pretty on arrival, but now, not so much","This juicer was very attractive when it arrived, but after 4 days, the smoke-colored plastic (polycarbonate?) became discolored with a whitish film that does not wash off. The manufacturer suggests soaking it in 10% lemon juice (a waste of good lemons), or wiping it down with olive oil. I did both of these and neither brought it back to its original luster, and it was way more work than I want to invest in upkeep. Other than that, it works great and produces juice very well."
3,Breville BJE510XL Ikon 900-Watt Juicer,Juicer is not optimal as it can leave chunks of carrots untouched. It is also quite large in size. Soft fruits leave moist pulp.
5,Breville 900 Juicer,"I love, love this juicer...I did some background on models and Breville came up first...and decided on their middle watt unit..EAsy to use..easy clean up and not too large. It takes every drop of juice that a fruit has to give...not too loud either. I am so glad I made the purchase...and additionally, I lost 5 lbs in 2 weeks...just juicing once a day..."
4,Great product,Works nicely&#65292;would have gave it a five star if cleaning the filter was easier. Apple juice absolutely fresh was awsome.
4,"So far, so good","I am liking it. The pulp is not completely dry, but again, what do you expect for the price! If you really want drier pulp then buy a masticating style juicer which is more expensive. I am using mine to do some 10 days juicing, so paying twice the price would not be very beneficial. My friend has a Omega juicer (~ $500 ), but she is daily juicer so it is good for her. But for me, this one is good."
5,Fantastic product and 5 stars to Amazon for its delivery!,"I always wanted to buy a Breville and this model was on top of my list. This is primarily because I wanted vary the consistency of the juice to add a bit of fiber in my drink. The varying speed control lets me do just that. Kudos to Amazon's delivery in 2 days flat, I am very pleased I bought this specifically at Amazon and not at Macy's."
5,Coolest thing in my kitchen.,"Bought this juicer based on the great reviews it got on Amazon, not disappointed in the least. It does the job well, and looks sleek and cool on my kitchen counter to boot. Please note that all juicers make a fair amount of noise, there is no magical ""quiet"" juicer. However, this Breville works as smoothly and as ""quietly"" as I've ever experienced, so that definitely adds to the appeal, especially because I tend to use the juicer in the early morning and don't want to wake up others in the house. Finally, it's really well built so I feel like I'll be able to use this machine for a long time to come."
5,Great Unit,"We love our Breville BJE510Xl, it works great very easy to clean up,Very happy we pick this unit over others. Like that it has a Variable-speed."
1,MY FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THIS JUICER,"I felt like a kid on Christmas Day when the FedEx guy delivered my juicer. We've been spending lots of money on our ""Green Fix"" at the farmer's market, so I've been dying for my own juicer.Just today I unpacked the Breville, carefully removed all plastic & packaging, and washed according to instructions. I also reassembled according to instructions, turned the dial to recommended speed and gently placed a few cut celery stalks into the mouth while the motor was running. We only got as far as one half a stalk before the motor burned out.If one half of a celery stalk burns out the motor, how in the world can one juice BEETS?!Since it's Saturday, customer service is closed. I hope I get a replacement for the money I just shelled out. Dang. I was so looking forward to this."
4,Excellent Juicer,This is undoubtedly an excellent juicer. My only objection is the price. I wished it was about 20-30% cheaper. Besides it's made in China where labor and materials are much lower than Australia and US.
1,Dead motor,"Had the Breville BJE510XL juicer just over two weeks. Even though it said you could put whole fruits and veggies in, I was pre-chopping them. The juicer motor simply died. Call the company and they said they would send a new one out, pronto. Have not yet received it. Hopefully the new juicer is a better product than the original one I received."
1,Frustrating experience,"This juicer has been trouble from the start. To date, we are on our second juicer after filing a warranty claim directly with Breville. The issue has been with the motor working intermitently or not at all. The juicer will turn on, but will not run the motor. After a warranty claim with Breville, we have another juicer with the same issues. Reviews on the Breville website indicate that we are not the only customer experiencing these challenges. At this point I have wasted money on a juicer and fresh produce when the machine simply will not function. In the future I will not purchase a Breville product."
1,Looks awesome. Wish it would work,"Received the item quickly from amazon. Unpacked and assembled juicer per instructions. When trying to operate juicer it would not power on. Disassembled, reassembled. Nothing. Tried another outlet nothing. DOANo biggie. Call customer service. After 25 mins on phone item not in stock.Pretty upset spending the money on a better juicer and product doesn't work. Even more upset I would have to wait a month to get a replacement.The Juicer felt and looked great. Easy to assemble. To bad made in china and passed thru quality standards buy being DOA.Now I know why I see the same juicer on newegg for $75 refurbished."
3,Motor just stopped after a few months of use.,"I own this juicer, model number BJE510XL. I purchased it in Sept of 2011. I used it for a little over 4 months and was very pleased with the amount of juice it made, and the ease of use.It suddenly stopped working one morning when the motor would just not turn on.I turned the knob and the lights come on with no error codes, the lock bar was in place securely, but the motor would not turn on.I cared for this juicer very well and always followed the instructions in using and caring for this model.I can see many consumer complaints with the exact same problem posted on Breville's website.Customer support has offered for me to mail in the juicer for an exchange but it will take several 6-10 weeks to get a replacement.UPDATE - This juicer started working again after three days. I lifted it up and banged it down on the counter two times. Plugged it back in and Voila! It is working again..."
3,Juice Maker,"Unfortunately, I have to say that this juicer does not evacuate properly into the bucket at the back. It gums up and I have to stop the machine and open it up when it is half full and manually move the fiber out of the center chamber into the bucket.I would not buy another one.Thanks"
2,Has trouble juicing small fruit like grapes and cherries,"This product works fairly well, but it seems to have trouble doing a good job with small fruit. It tends to throw much it out into the ""pulp bin"" instead of juicing it."
4,Juice away!,"Absolutely love this newer model of the Breville juicers. I owned the older, two speed model and this model is much better by far. It is an adjustable five speed juicer, so you can set speeds lower for leafy veggies and higher for harder veggies and everything in between! I use this daily and it has been a life saver when I'm on the go and need the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients fruits and vegetables have. I would recommend this purchase for those who are health conscious and those who are just beginning to juice. It is a very easy to maintain and clean device. With that being said, make sure to wash it right after you finish juicing or else the residue will stick to the plastic material."
5,Pure Joy,"The beauty of heaven in earthly brilliance ,the love for all man kind inspired from Jesus. Carried out by his child who responded to his words.I enjoyed seeing and hearing the Trinity in all their fragrance."
5,Amazing,I love this book. I couldn't put it down. She is amazing and her talent is a gift from God. A must read.
2,"Inspirational young woman - very, very short book.","I am inspired by this young woman, her faith and her connection to God, but I paid $9.99 for the kindle version of this book and was hoping for more than 40 minutes of reading material."
2,NYreader,"I was disappointed in the Kindle version of this book since there seem to be many pictures of Akiane's artwork and the Kindle didn't do it justice. I also felt the book wasn't well written. I would like to have read more about the subject, about 50% of the book is her poetry and artwork."
3,worth reading,"The book is definitely worth reading. I learned about this book by reading ""Heaven Is for Real"". Not as much information in this book as I had desired but it was not hard to follow as another reviewer had written. About half or more of the book is her poems and paintings which are all that is in chapters at the rear of the book."
2,Wouldn't have made me a believer,"Akiane is unusually talented but I didn't like the book. It might have been better if it were told by Akiane herself and not her mother's perspective. The poems were confusing. The paintings were incredible, especially the ones of Jesus. The book would not have made me a believer."
5,Akiane,"I am the great believer in never putting anyone/thing on a pedestal. Time changed all. However, Akiane is the nearest anyone has come to breaking my stance. The book is written not from a professional angle, but rather from a good lay person, which to me is a better way for an autobiagraphy for someone so young. An astounding account of what she has achieved so far. A must read for anyone who questions spirituality and belief in what is."
5,Amazing!,The gift of art and poetry this little girl has is absolutely amazing! The book itselfpresents her work very nicely and I like even the feel of the pages. Definitely get this!
5,Amazing Talent,"It is amazing to see the work of a young girl who started receiving trips to Heaven when she was 4 years old.. She spoke to God and He spoke to her. She began painting what she saw. Even then her talent was evident. Now, 10 or more years older, she has painted numerous paintings, which are very realistic and they look like someone much older, and with training in art, would have painted them. What is so amazing is that her parents did not believe in God, and Alaine even painted two pictures of Jesus Christ..They are expertly done. Her parents now believe in God, knowing that Aliane was given this talent by God. She also writes poetry given to her by God.This book is very well written and produced. Especially if you like art, you would like it."
2,not received,"hello,I have not received this CD.It is very long. I am waiting again a little timebye byeme vivaldi"
2,Used book described as NEW,The book was described as NEW but clearly was not. One of the pages (5-6) was folded and damaged as a result. This should have been described as USED!
5,Truly amazing,Wow. What amazing art and poetry. This book beautifully displays the work of a young lady gifted by God. This book shows a glimpse Akiane's talent and character. Her website reveals more of both.
5,what a story!,This girl blew me away! what an amazing little girl with an extraordinary talent. I bought this book to have Akiane's paintings in print (as opposed to just viewing them on her website) but to have her short biography (written by her mother) as well was a bonus. I actually bought two copies of this book-- one to keep and one to circulate among my friends and family.
5,"Akiane: Her Life, Her Art, Her Poetry",I enjoyed this book immensely. The history presented by the artist's mother was well done and the presentation of Akiane's art was excellent. The artist's art and poetry were superb and the production values of the book added to my enjoyment.
5,A suggested reading for all!,"This book is changing my life. The author is gifted with wisdom beyond her years. Her insights into what really matters in our lives is right on target. I gave a copy of this book as a gift, too, and I plan to give more in the future."
5,awesome,I bought this book for my wife for Mother's Day. It turned out to be the best present I have bought her yet. She was overcome by its message and by the messenger. Very powerful story.
5,Akiane's talents are truly a git from God,I have shared this book with many people suffering from a loss of a loved one or thatare in a terminal illness themselves. All have been very inspired by her drawings andpoetry. It gives us all hope that there must be a heaven and what it is like. She has agift that is bigger than herself. I look forward to seeing how her art evolves over the years.I look at her website frequently to view her current drawings.
5,Akiane,"I wanted to share Akiane's story with a friend, so I gave it to her as a Christmas gift. I already have the book."
5,Very Interesting,It is amazing how insightful and knowledgeable this little girl was from a very young age. Her paintings were literally a work of Art and her poetry was also amazing. She has been given extraordinary talents starting at a young age and she has done her best to express her visions and thoughts through her art and poetry. She is doing what she has been called upon to do and I respect that. I would recommend this book.
5,Awesome Artist,"This book is very endearing. This girl's spirit sees into another dimension and then she is able to communicate it through painting and poetry. The book also talks about her family's life challenges, which allows the reader to get more acquainted with the personhood of the artist. Well done book with beautiful pictures!"
5,LOVED the book and this movie is one of my ALL TIME FAVOURITE MOVIES EVER!!!,"Had the book growing up, read it cover to cover MANY times! I also have both movies on DVD and also the 1st one on VHS! I highly recommend this movie to any coming of age girl! As it teaches a girl alot about life!"
2,Poor Retraction,"We had enjoyed using a WalkAbout by Aspen Pets for 13 years without incidence, and the thing took quite a beating from the occasional dropping and dragging of the unit that happens with dogs. So, naturally when the gear finally gave out, I went to purchase another one just like the one we'd had. This one by PetMate does not have near the quality as the Aspen Pets product. The main problem we have is that it is very slow to retract so it ends up getting tangled around the dogs' legs. We use a harness collar, so the retractable leashes - when they work - are always above the dog since the hook-up is on their back/shoulder area. The slow retraction is also dangerous since it makes it difficult to 'reel her in' when cars are approaching. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product... Please bring back the Aspen Pets quality!"
1,Piece of junk,"After having the leash for a month, it exploded when I pulled on it. My dog is 30 pounds."
2,BEWARE,"This concert was done in 1975. It's about 20 minutes of Freda Payne and 20 minutes of the Stylistics. But, it was taken from a vhs tape and in some places the tracking is off and it's garbled. If you want it just for that sense of history - OK. But be forewarned."
5,Excellent Face Wash,"I've been using this face wash for about a year or two now. Personally, I don't think that this treats acne, but in conjunction with other products, it may. I use it mainly to wash my face, after all the sweat, grime, and whatnot. I would use this with benzoyl peroxide and if that doesn't work then I recommend seeing a dermatologist, which is quite expensive but quite effective.Everyone's skin is different, which is why there are so many different results. This alone may work to treat many people with acne problems, but it's not a guarantee. For me, it isn't that effective, but I can guarantee, though, that it's a very good face wash. And that's the first step to treating acne, right? Getting a clean face.Edit: I should also note that I bought this on August 1, 2011 and it will expire on September 2012."
3,Not a permanent acne solution!,My skin got use to this wash after 6 months and it stopped working. It's just a temporary solution.
1,If you have any sensitivity to anything you prob should not buy this,"My doctor recommended this to be and since I found it on Amazon cheaper I ordered it on here. Started using it the day I got it. The first day I had no problem, until I woke up the next morning and my face felt like it was on fire and my skin was pealing off my face. It has been three days since I stopped using it and my skin is still not back to normal I patches of dray irritated (bright red) areas all over my face. It is kinda sad because I had high hopes for this products and now looking at other review, others have had the same people have had the same problem."
2,Ehh its ok,"i bought this same product from target, not amazon. The product is ok, its just that when i use it it tends to dry out my face a little and make it a little tight as well. ive only been using it for three days if anyone is wondering the length of my usage. Also when i used this in the morning there was some flaking going on on my skin which was embarassing cuz i didnt know till someone pointed it out. Overall for me personaly this product didnt work to well. Maybe itll work for you so give it a try. :)"
5,Simply the best!,"This soap is just incredible! I have tried everything and nothing had worked. I started using this soap with ""Nature's Cure Two Part Acne treatment"" and this has been the perfect combination for me!I will keep on using this product since it has been the only one that has worked!"
2,There are Much better products out there,"hi there, I tried this product a year ago. two weeks after using it my cheeks were breaking out terribly, clogged pores, redness, and the continuous use of Neutrogena's acne wash only made it worst. I waited 3 months and tried it again and got the same resultsI would recommend to anyone with skin problems, or just concerned about skin health, to use BIORÉ Products (their Pore Unclogging Scrub Bioré Pore Unclogging Scrub 5 oz (3 pack) is the equivalent to this).Bioré saved my life. (on top of that it's cheaper & even better than Proactive-Neutrogena)Just use it and thank me later ;)"
5,Great Product,"Clears up my face pretty well. Doesn't burn my skin or bleach my towels. Where prescriptions and other products have failed, Neutrogena has succeeded. This acne wash feels great and does the job. After that, there isn't much else to say."
3,Decent.,"I've used this product for a few months now and it really dries out my skin.My skin also gets very sensitive when I use this, and I only see decent results.If you have sensitive skin, or don't want to get dry skin, you won't like this.It really burned when I put it on, and needless to say I do not use it anymore.I had heard good things about it, but it doesn't work for me."
1,"Irritated skin, Caused more breakouts.",I have used this product for five days and my skin is severely red and irritated. It provoked further breakouts and the areas that aren't broken out are red. Don't buy!!!!
1,broke my face out,Do not buy this product! This was the reason why my face was breaking out. I switched over to a benzoyl peroxide wash and my acne was disappearing. Now im left with scars from the acne due to this wash.
4,Gradually Introduce it into your skincare routine...,"Neutrogena Oil-Free (fragrance free) face wash works well at clearing up/minimizing acne but you must gradually introduce it to your routine otherwise your skin will dry out! Use it maybe every other day at first, maybe three times a week, and eventually once daily until your skin can adjust to the product.Once you start using the produce keep with it. I stopped for a week and I started to break out again so this stuff definitely works!Since I've almost used up the entire bottle I've noticed my skin is very smooth. I do not have to use as much makeup in the morning which is very nice. All I can say is try a bottle but do not buy the three pack until you know if it will work for you."
2,Didn't help acne at all.,"All it did was slightly dry out my face, making more room for acne.It didn't prevent anything. Terrible product. I wouldn't recommend, unless you like having a dry face and more acne."
5,Incredible.,"I have severe acne, and I have spent hundreds of dollars over the years trying every acne wash out there. None of them have worked well, until now. Using the ""Neutrogena Acne Wash"" has improved my acne tremendously, and boosted my self-confidence. I also use the ""Neutrogena Toner,"" and then use the ""Clean and Clear Persagel 10"" (for the benzoyl peroxide). I have days where I have absolutely no zits on my face; a first in years.And by the way, if anyone is trying Proactiv, don't. It's too expensive and not strong enough for most people with chronic acne. I used it and it didn't do a thing."
3,Please watch your s and d key the next time you write a book,"Great plot, interesting characters, and too many spelling mistakes where a ""d"" should have been an ""s"". I'm only 33% into this book but i had to come and leave this review because what should have been ""please Azura, don't let me get sick in here"" was written as something else entirely due to ""sick"" not being as it should. If spelling errors completely throw you off of reading a book then this may not be the best book for you."
3,Drumroll please,"With it's three believable main chacarters, I enjoyed this, and the previous books for several reasons. THey were all believable, as in, ""yeah, i could understand why they did that."" Unlike when i read other books i wonder why they just didn't run far, far away.It was also long, without feeling like it dragged on. A dedicated person could read it in one sitting. It also has good dialouge/despcirtion. Conversations never took forever, and i had a good idea about the surroundings, without it feeling like some books, where they take pages to descibe a non-important tree.But something about it wasn't quite right. Some of the problems were solved too easliy, in unbelievable ways. But you don't immediatly notice. It's like in action movies, where the lone hero kills all the enemies but nothing bad happens to him. And issues resovled to quickly.Don't knock on death's door. Ring the bell and run - he hates that.-Something's telling me that i got this from one of Terry Pratchett's books."
2,Unreadable,"At the time of my writing this review, there isn't a single serious review of this book. I think this is because no one can actually finish it. I picked this up at a used bookstore and the first page is full of beautiful flowing prose and lush descriptions. However, the novel itself jumps around chaotically. Impressively long paragraphs of unrelated sentences make for a hard reading. I've picked it back up three times now and still have not gotten a third of the way through.The subject is fascinating and I would love to get through this book, but so far I find it essentially unreadable. Perhaps it is the fault of the translator, perhaps it is the author. I doubt it is me, for I enjoy involved literature. It is my opinion that almost no one wants to actually slog through this novel, no matter how beautiful the prose is."
4,this movie was pretty good!,"this movie wasn't well made, lacking many production details, but this movie is very helpful and interesting if you are looking into starting a community or science study aquarium then this is defidently a helpful source! I was not succeeding at properly caring for my aquarium fish tank, but after i watched this video im doing great, now i own 4 aquarium tanks and i know a whole lot more than i did. i defidently reccomend it!!!!!!"
4,DOUBLE BILL,"What else is there to add to the Product Description except to say that it was recorded around 1970, the sound quality is Good and that Joe Farrell plays strictly Tenor Sax on his sextets 2 long tracks and to mention that his tone is beefed up here as opposed to his earlier endeavors, sounding tonaly closer to Joe Henderson than to George Coleman."
4,Great Color Laserjet,This is a 600 dpi printer with a carosel based print engine. It features 16ppm black and 4ppm color. Print quality and results are outstanding. This printer earns a 4 out of 5 stars. Would have gotten 5 out of 5 if there was a higher DPI print resolution.
1,Didn't Receive It,I sent out an email on 26 June and have not received any reply. You can't give a review on a book that you didn't received!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Can't rate what I have not seen!
4,Awesome for football Sundays,This is just the right size a Sunday night dinner while watching football. It's it enough for an entree and 3 sides. This thing is encredible.
4,A rare treat,"This is the second part of the much neglected collection of piano sonatas by Russian composer, Nikolai Medtner. Written in Beethovenian tradition, though with rich romantic overtones not unlike Beethoven's late sonatas.Jaded pianists who are tired of playing Beethoven Op. 110 yet again should take a look at these. The rich, indulgent, Sonata-Ballada, Op. 27, is highly recommended. Its finger-twisting fugue in the last movement keeps even the most technically proficient pianist working."
4,Chicago VOcal Selections,"The notes are accurate, except that if you haven't listened to the recording, you may not know that most of Roxy's songs are supposed to be sung down an octave. This is not written anywhere in the book, however."
4,Great music,"Bought this simply because I needed ""Cellophane"" music for an audition. As a theatre geek, it's probably good to own this."
1,Useless,This guide has no value either for planning or when you are there. The lists are obvious and can be gotten free from any free travel agency.
1,DEPRECATED TAGS!,"If you are looking to learn something that is useful for doing anything other than adept reformatting of out-of-date Web pages then you will be wastign your money. Dont waste your time if you want to do correct inline styling either. This is not even a beginniners book anymore, it is a hinderance. They call it ""deprecated"" when a tag is no longer in use. You will hvae to relearn a lot. Spend the $ some place else and get a book that has XHTML 1.0 minimum and then focus on your HTML 5 skills and CSS. HTML 5 is only a slight addition of new tags and semantic meaning."
2,Broke After Several Months,It was a great leash but broke after 4 months of use hence I would have to say it's cheaply made. Too bad it was a good leash when it was in active service.
4,"Kick Back, Relax and Enjoy","If you are familiar with the works of Anne Tyler or Richard Russo and enjoy their stories, you'll probably like Ms. Doyon's book. Growing up in a small town, I feel that the author has done a good job of depicting certain aspects of living in such a community. Though the story never had me laughing out loud or babbling like a baby, I did find myself in a near constant state of amusement or pity. Ms. Doyon's book was written well enough that I cared for many of the characters; no matter how flawed they appeared. It was a very pleasant, summer read."
2,Boring!,"I guess I read a different version. The story in my book was BORing! Every chapter is full of background, and I kept thinking ""Okayyyy, I've got the background, now let's get going with the story."" And then, the chapter ends. The Pinkham sisters are some of the most despicable and unlikable characters I've ever run across in a book. What planet are these people from!"
3,A great voice from the past,"I really enjoyed this DVD, but I wish he did more songs from his albums. I miss hearing him sing and wonder what he is doing now and why he quit singing. I recommend this DVD to all fans of David Soul."
1,Toy was broken when it arrived !!!!!!,Ordered this for my son's Christmas present. It was broken and still in the box.Sent back weeks ago and cannot get a return ! Will not order again !
3,The Philosopher's Stone,"Bok is a well known philosopher/writer. This present volumes defends a view that there are common values--perhaps universal ones. What is missing from the book is a clear notion of what""common"" means. There is no attempt to actually look at values both past and present to see if IN FACT values are shared across place and time. The issue addressed is at least partially empirical/factual. Unfortunately the book pays little or no attention to anthropological data. Still a worthwhile study of an important issue."
4,good stocking stuffer,"i have a lot of little cousins and i bought these to send to them. after awhile and under heavy use the leave a black poweder on your hands but they are magnets hitting each other constantly go figure, just a warning they are loud."
1,Doesn't turn off!,"This toy looked so great that I bought 2. One for my daughter & one for my niece. After 1 day, I hid my daughters and she hasn't seen it since. It's terribly loud and does NOT shut off! There is no way to turn it off other than to remove the batteries. (...)... I guess it's good it's cheaper, but I still think its horrible."
3,VERY VERY LOUD!!!!!!!!!!,I have bought this for my 5 year old for christmas. I just recieved it the other day and it is unbelievably loud. I havent taken it out of the package but you can still press the buttons. I am not sure how my daughter will like it but I think it is going to drive me crazy. :-)
1,TOO LOUD!,I got this for my nephew last Christmas. It is REALLY LOUD - does not turn off and just annoying in general.
2,Slow and disappointing,"I was expecting this book to be a fun adventure. The plot is great, and I had such high hopes. The plot, however, was not enough to keep my attention for very long. The book droned on and on. The book didn't have much to keep the reader's interest at all. Generally with adventure novels, one finds enough action to keep one's attention until the climax of the story, but this was not the case with King Solomon's Mines."
4,She was a goddess playing a princess!,Maureen O'Hara played her part in Bagdad to perfection. She became such a part of the movie that the viewer was drawn into the play and you could not be released even after the movie was over. You will compare all other films about that part of the world to this movie for the restr of your life!
3,Not Heavy Enough,I wish the gloves would have been a bit heavier. I have seen other makes of this product. They have weights on the fingers unlike this brand.
2,"Too Vauge for Beginners, Too Basic for Experts","Berg's overview of qualitative methods has a great deal of promise, but it fell short of my expectations. I adopted this as a text in my qualitative methods course, and soon found that the treatment of various qualitative methods was overly vauge and confused students about the scope and purpose of qualitative research. In particular, Berg blurs the lines between focus groups, action research, and participant observation. One is left with a sense that all qualitative methods are equal and interchangable.Each chapter alone is well written, but there is a lack of an overarching structure to the book that results in an over-simplification of qualitative methods. I do not plan on utilizing this text for courses again, it is too vauge for beginners and too basic for experts. It is also to general for use as a reference book."
5,Highly recommended to haters of this dreary subject.,"Absolutely easy to read and understand! I never thought I could actually ""enjoy"" reading about the subject before I came across this book."
3,Failed Flashlight,"I ordered four of these high performance flashlights, and one of them failed when new. Or should I say failed to operate properly. When the on/off switch was pressed the light would come on only momentarily then go out and stay out. Amazon is sending me a replacement.Thanks, Andy"
3,Led Lenser LL7736,I had previously bought one of these flashlights at Home Depot and was very satisfied with my purchase. When I went back 2 1/2 months later to buy another one they no longer have them. I went to 3 different Home Depots and a Lowe's and could not find it. I bought this one off this page on Amazon from Knife Of The World.I have to say I was rather disappointed.I guess the LL in LL7736 model means low light because the one I had bought from Home Depot had a much stonger focused light. This one is weak compared to my original one. Everything else was the same just actual light was weak not strong at all. And the light was kind of blueish like another reviewer said.
1,Samsung customer service stinks - blame pyrex!,"My samsung microwave has a metal rack in the center that isnt hooked in very well. I put in a pyrex measuring cup with water and the steam made the rack touch the back of the microwave, causing it to arc.Samsung says that PYREX GLASS measuring cups have metal in the paint and therefore I voided my warranty by placing one in the microwave.What kind of a company blames another for their design flaw?The pyrex site lists safe microwave instructions and says nothing about metal in the paint.I'd be willing to testify in court that samsung is saying pyrex contains metal."
1,Horrible Sun Shade,I Love the stroller itself however the Sun shade is a different story!! When I brought the stroller I had to buy the accessory package to keep sun off the baby. After about 5 minutes of trying to figure out how to get the shade on(I had to unwrap the set mesh seat from the clips to hold the shade that would have been helpful in the directions)! I finally got the shade on. I seemed pleased with the shade while it was open when I went to close the stroller the stupid shade keeps falling off the stroller. So now that it keeps on falling off soo much it doesnt stay on tight and falls off even more. Pretty much the only reason I brought the accessory package was for the shade I consider it a waste of $$! Thank goodness someone at Maclaren finally woke up and redesigned the 2005 to come with the shade! Wish I wasnt stuck with the older model with the horrible shade!
3,It's Okay,Didn't seem up to Janet Evanovich's usual quality. Could have been ghost written as it comes close but not up to her par.
4,Evanovcih at her best!!!,Great story line. Not just sex but a real good story and funny. Evanovich books are great. I have read at least 95 % of her works.
3,Light Read,I bought this book to help pass the time until the next Stephanie Plum novel. It was enjoyable and interesting to see the early characters and dialogue later used in the Stephanie Plum novels.
5,ANOTHER GREAT STORY,Even the older stories by Janet Evanovich are wonderful. I highly recommend this audiobook - it is very well done and is so much fun!
3,Keystone Kops,"This is a reprint of an early novel by the author. While it is not great fiction, it has its moments. Katherine Finn has a camera pod from a helicopter crash through her roof and land in her bed. This brings about an introduction to her next door neighbor, David Dodd, who uses the opportunity to get to know her. His obsession with Kate becomes a distraction to her career as a musician.Various characters and events add to the confusion, including the explosion of a drug house, an attempted kidnapping of Kate, etc. There is even an appearance by her ex-husband. The novel eventually winds forward to an expected conclusion."
3,Short but sweet,"It was funny and a good read, like most of Janet's, but really short. I couldn't find it at the library so bought Kindle version and read it in a few hours. If you have to read everything Evanovich writes, then you won't be disappointed. Just don't expect a long, satisfying journey."
3,Quick & Cute,"This was a quick read. It was a cute little story about neighbors who are very unlikely to end up together. After a series of unfortunate events, it seems like being together is really the best thing for them despite their differences."
3,back to the bedroom- a bit slow,i liked the book but it was a bit slow at the start. not one of her best books. character did not seem to have asmuch fun as most of her characters in other books.
3,FLUFF PIECE,"Evanovich wrote 9 fluff piece books for Harlequin. If you've been able to catch them used on the internet and have read them you do see where some of her characters developed from...Grandma Mazur, the buick, and others. However, I was hoping they hoping she had beefed them out a bit. That is not the case. However, if waiting for her next book to come out....this is something to fill your time."
4,Very Sweet Romance,"I stumbled across these by luck... I already loved the Stephanie Plum series, and happened to see these on the bookshelf. They're not Plum. They are simple, sweet, romantic stories. Light and fluffy. And sometimes that's perfect. :)"
4,Amazon Review,A fun and lighthearted read. I laughed out loud as usual with this author in her tale about a piece of a camera falling through her roof and all the complications that ensue. The romance was believable and charming.
3,She is a nutcase.,"Not exactly like the numbers, but just as crazy. Janet must have more than one loose screw. Her books are very entertaining."
3,Cute,"Cute - fun to read, quick to read, enjoyable book. The author always has interesting characters in her books. Liked it."
2,Too predictable....,"I probably would not recommend this book at all.Not much of a content to hold my interest.I was really,really disappointed."
2,Back to the bedroom,This book is your typical romance. This was an okay read. .I prefer the Stephanie Plum novels. I like a good mystery.
4,Great Evanovich story,"I really enjoy Evanovich writing. Just the right touch of humor. Wish she'd write faster, I love her characters..so real"
3,"Cute, Clean Romance","This is a good, clean romance about the boy(man) next door. A fun read for anyone. This book truly shows that opposites attract!"
1,Back to The Bedroom,"Stupid. Don't waste your time. I enjoy the ""Numbered"" novels and was greatly disappointed by this sappy, unrealistic Harlequin-esque romance. Blah."
5,Funny story,I am a big Janet Evanovich fan since I read the first Stephanie Plum book (I have read all of them) Anytime Janet Evanovich comes out with a new book I have to get it. I loved the story and as usual laughed out loud!!
3,Back to the bedroom,"I LOVE Janet E 's books, but this one was a bit slow... still fun. I'll still buy her books."
4,Nice and Fluffy,"If your looking for Plum put this book down. You wont find her between these sheets of romance or cello music.Kate is a riches to rags sort of gal and Dave is a rags to riches sloucher. She works all the time tutoring and playing cello. He sits home all day eating pizza and reading comics. They're neighbors and well...they dont get along until one day when Kate has an object fall from a plane thru her roof. Then a series of events get started that heats things up.I am a huge fan of Janet Evanovich and I really liked Back to the Bedroom. While I agree it doesn't come close to her Stephanie Plum novels it is still a great soft, funny, cushy kind of read. It's more of a quirky romance book than a mystery.I recommend this book to folks who want a light and quick read.[...]"
2,Nothing to jump about,A bit bellow average book.....no big deal of a read....you will not want to make cart wheels after reading the book.lol
1,The stupidest book I have ever read!,My review title says it all... this is the stupidest book I have ever read. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it never did. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Not best for audiobook,I listen to a lot of audiobooks. I know from researching that C. J. Critt is supposed to be one the best but I had a hard time with this book. She did Elsie the old woman well (kind of sounded like Jessica Tandy in Driving Miss Daisy but the male character not so much. She sounds like a kind of cooky/massive smoker voice that I could not get into.
3,Funny but he doesn't really like Canada very much,"The book is funny throughout the entire book, but you can tell he really doesn't like Canada very much. He also writes Why I Hate Canada. Haven't read it and don't plan to."
5,How To Be A Canadia,"Will Ferguson is a Canadian who can gently poke fun at Canadians and their mannerisms, foibles, without being mean. I am a former Canadian(now American) who loves to see my former life in his books."
3,Written for a canadian.,"Reviews looked good, title got me hooked but as a none canadian I just did'nt get it. It did make me laugh but over all it went straight over my head, never mind even if you already are one, you have to be one. However, having spoken to lots of canadian they enjoyed it and got it, so it must have been me."
4,An Excellent Resource,"Janowitz provides a good resource with this book, which provides an overview of possible conditions that affect the lower intestinal tract. This book is not just for someone with a chronic condition, although irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and diverticulitis are covered. Janowitz also has excellent chapters on coping with the occasional food poisoning episode or traveler's diarrhea. His overview of the functioning of the intestinal tract is one the best I've come across in all my resources. As with most intestinal subjects, Janowitz doesn't have a lot of answers - more coping information - but he does seek to present diet and medical therapies for each condition. He does not spend enough time on alternative therapies or the various nutritional concerns that accompany lower GI problems. A good read and possibly a purchase if you suffer from one or more of the problems outlined."
2,Poor service,"The company that supplied my product only sent one jar, though I ordered two. They billed for two. My emails through Amazon were not responded to and I am not pleased. Also, when I opened the package and tried to remove the tape from the one jar I received, shards of glass cut my hand in several places. I would suspect that was my second jar. Do not purchase from this supplier. The jar I did receive was very nice after I cleaned off the broken glass."
2,Pass on this one,This TV is NOT 1080p. It will not work with a blu ray player or PS 3. Trust me I know. Picture quality from broadcast and DVD is fine. DVR is almost impossible to use. Spend your money elsewhere. Mitsubishi dropped the ball on this one and they know it. It is apparent when you call customer relations.
5,Exactly as advertised,This product was extremely easy to install. I left the windows up for a couple days and no problems. Now I can leave the windows cracked and not worry about rain getting in which keeps the truck cooler. And they look sharp.
3,Better than Reflector but not that great,"I really like Killing Heidi and I was excited to get this cd. Although Present doesn't give me as much as a headache like Reflector, it is almost annoying. First of all, Ella's voice isn't as loud but she cracks her voice so much I'm not sure if shes got a cold or if shes a boy going thru puberty. Second, the songs are catchy but can also really get under your skin. I wouldn't say Ella and her brother are the greatest lyric writers. Some songs I can hardly listen to because she just repeats the same thing over and over and over and over again. And the songs don't make sense. Its just random words ("" walking always over windows weeping willow wind blows"")Theres too much music and not enough words. I'd have to say that Ammyl, Burnt, Heavensent and Outside of Me are the best songs on the album. I'm not sure whats up with the Heidilude things either. Regardless of my over analyzing, Present has pretty catchy music. Its a good cd and its worth it."
4,X/L Hoops,"These are nice wire hoops. I would have given them 5 stars, but I have medium length hair and sometimes when I flip it or move it off my shoulder my finger gets caught in it & I snatch the hoop out of my ear! (It doesn't hurt, more concerned about losing the earring).If you have long hair or are rough with jewelry, look for some with a more secure closure."
2,Quality,The quality is not what I expected. The earrings are too flimsy and thin. I was hoping for something a little heavier and strong in a large hoop.
1,Thin small flimsy gold hoops,I purchased these and when they arrived I was so dissapointed. I gues somethings you have to see before you purchase. I tried to return and was told I had to pay a fee. What a ripoff.
2,Don't waste your money,"I love hoops and wanted large gold hoops. I received them as a gift and they are toooooo flimsy and I will loose one as I too have already pulled it out of my ear by moving my hair. The product should be about $20, it is only 14K and VERY THIN. I am dissatisfied with this product and would not buy from seller again."
2,grip on tools adjustable wrench set,"too much play in the adjustment, save your money for a quality set. you can use these if you don't mind slippage."
4,Sunroof Wind Deflector,The item was easy to install and looks as good or better than the OEM deflector that came with the car (a 1992 Nissan Stanza).
5,good for storing cards that you're ready to trade,"My son keeps the cards that he wants to trade in this case. That way he doesn't have to worry about them being mishandled and they're kept seperate from his deck. Also, when we had a garage sale this summer he displayed his cards in this."
5,Pretty Good in different situations,"If you have cards, I recommend you get this. I keep my deck in a deck box, and kepp all my others in this. Better than deck Protecters because These keep them in better condition than deck protectors.WHenever I need to trade cards I just slip them out and trade.( I did end up needing more room, but this still works to keep cards in mint condition.)"
4,"Great, convenient, likes my Mac","Wonderful! I don't know much about video, but I just plugged it in and it worked. I am really pleased with the quality of the video and the nice way it connects to the software that came free on my computer (iMovie).Yesterday I took video in falling snow. I set the camera to Snow/Sand setting, and it took care of everything. Nice feature.The manual is minimal. I hope to find something better online."
2,Mediocre performance,These filters do not seem to work well-certainly they do not wick nearly as well as the originals. Try to reuse the old ones.
3,"Okay, but....","I enjoyed the writing and characters of this book more than the last few by Ms. Hooper, but I have to say the book seemed to leave a lot of questions unanswered at the end. The book starts with Riley waking in in bed, covered in blood, with no idea how she got there. At the end of the book, it still wasn't clear how she came to be covered in blood, and how she ended up in her own bed. I hate to read a whole book and end up where I started."
2,So....Boring....,"Im a gonna be short and sweet here. I was expecting a lot from this paranormal book about a psychic heroine - i was disappointed.very much so. There is not much romance - so I wouldnt call it a romantic thriller. Didnt give me any thrills at all either. I skimmed through the pages I was soo uninterested. I couldnt connect with the heroine which to me didn't seem likable at all. Also, unfortunately, the book is treated exclusively on the heroine's point of view. I'm sure this is done so as to add to the ""suspence"" but for me this was a major drawback because I prefer to read also the hero's point of view (well actually I wouldnt go that far as to say there is a hero in this novel - its almost exclusively on Riley and that's it).I expected something like Dream Man by Linda Howard - an autstanding romantic suspence about a woman who is psychic -its way hotter than this one and contains much more thrills.and the ending? BORING!"
1,SLEEPING WITH FEAR,"Sleeping with FearThe fact that Kay Hooper is a best-selling author is proof that America has stopped reading. Her books are notoriously dull, long-winded and the writing juvenile at best. She uses the same phrases over and over and over..... This book was the worst one I've read of hers, although all of her books are poorly written. The dialoge between her characters is downright embarrassing - reminds me of things I wrote in grammar school. She has an interesting-enough premise in this book, but takes entirely too long to sort out the details. In this particular book, the character has to eat a lot of power bars for energy. I believe Kay Hooper used the word ""power bar"" about a million times, if not more. The repetitive writing and just plain dull storyline make this a book to definitely skip."
2,Disappointing book from good author,"I've read all of Kay Hooper's Bishop/Special Crimes Unit books and enjoyed them, which is saying a lot because I don't normally go for psychic crime solving. This one was a bit of a disappointment, though. I won't summarize the plot - you can find it elsewhere. What bothered me was that, for almost the entire book, Kay Hooper (who normally writes a fairly fast-paced story) spent one-sentence-paragraph after one-sentence-paragraph telling the reader that Riley couldn't remember, Riley didn't know what was happening, and Riley didn't know who to trust. It must truly be a challenge to develop a plot around an amnesiac heroine, and yet in Hiding in the Shadows, Ms. Hooper did it well. This time, I got the point already! I just wanted the story to pick up its pace."
2,Not up to par...,"This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper. Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time). The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him). If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard."
3,Not so good,"If you only compare this book with the other two of the trilogy you'll see that something is missing in this one. Maybe is not so thrilling or too many Powerbars -I read the e-book and it has the feature to count words, 24 times is written this word. In the other hand I can't tell you you won't enjoy it if you like paranormal readings."
3,Just Sleeping...fear not necessary,"I am a huge fan of Kay Hooper's writing in general, and specifically enjoy the Bishop/SCU series. However, this latest work was not up to her usual standards. Clearly with paranormal suspense, the suspension of disbelief is necessary. However, you can't get rid of DNA testing - all military & law enforcement DNA is on-file, which is a huge kink in the story (sorry if I gave away too much). I'll continue to reader her books, but this wasn't as good as anything she's written thus far."
2,Audiobook is relentlessly perky!,"Wow do I agree with the reviewers that found this book boring! The endless power bars, all she does is talk, talk, talk. Definitely the worst of the series. I find it ridiculous that the FBI would allow one of their agents to be left in this situation with no backup. They could send a non paranormal FBI agent. I have been listening to it, and the reader is completely perky all the time, no matter what she is saying it sounds like she is absolutely delighted, and her voice for Ashe is like a gravelly old drunk, not very sexy!! The previous novels were read by Dick Hill, so this is a real come down!"
3,Sleeping With Fear,Not as good as some of her books. It's just okay. Probably wouldn't recommend it. Geez didn't know I had to write a book to grade it.
4,great author,this is the author I like a lot and will read most of her books. would recommend this to others
2,"very repeating,... over and over.. ho hummm","this book was really a ho humm. It was very repetitive over and over with the main character blacking out, and eating voraciously...the ending was just blah..glad this was a swap and not a full out purchase..pass this one up.."
2,"slow, vvvveeeeerrrryyyyy slow","too much romance, less supernatural, a lot less psychic senses stuff... also too many things that make you sit up and say 'what the???' and that pulls you right out of the story. Too many unbelievable parts. Too much repetition as if being paid by the word. I am on here today, hoping to see how it ends. I have the audio version and it is hard to 'read ahead' with audio and I'm tired of it, but I'd still like to know how it ends."
4,Memory problems frustrate a psychic sleuth,"This is my first Kay Hooper novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It opens in a way similar to some other stories or video games - Resident Evil - for example, where the heroine wakes, know remembering what is going on. In this story, she awakens in bed fully clothed and covered in blood. Furthermore, and to her surprise, she has taken a lover and does not remember why. She doesn't know who she can trust. And to frustrate things, her psychic abilities are on the blink.This makes for a fast-moving, exciting mystery."
4,It's worth the money.,I got this game for my birthday and I played it at once. The first few levels are boring until it gets to the villain fighting. I like this game in all ways exepept unlike the first game you can't swing wherever you want. You can only swing on web targets. And a lot of levels are to easy. And some levels are just a little to hard. Exaple Mysterio throwing rocks at you is just to hard and I can't beat him. By the way if you can tell me how to beat him a liitle more easy then type [...] and I'll try to beat him. When you try to throw rocks at Mysterio they explode in your face. And you can't even climb to the top of the Buildings. Yet this game seems to be worth the money only if your a Spidey fan.
5,awesome game,"this game has not hit stores yet, but when it does it is going to be the best game of the summer. There is new combat moves with your web, you can go up to the top of the tallest sckscraper and do a dive and fall all the way down until the very last minite where you put your web up and are saved from the freefall. You battle new enimies straight from the movie like DR. OCTOPUS and many more. I no im going to buyit when it comes out in 7 days. I reccomend buying this game if you like Spider man obviously and if you like free falling from tall towers and covering your opponent in web.BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Activision RIP-OFF,"This is **NOT** THE CONSOLE VERSION of Spiderman 2!! The console version for Xbox/Playstation etc was developed by Treyarch and is supposed to really rock.**This** version of the game was developed by a bunch of lame hacks called Fizz Factor Game Studios who couldn't make a decent game to save their lives.This is Activision's deliberate ploy to trick PC users into buying the PC version based on the hype about the console game. That is why Activision uses the EXACT same packaging as the console version for a PC game that is NOTHING LIKE IT.There should be a lawsuit filed for this kind of misleading marketing. Activision should be paying people to play this lousy game, and you know what, I *still* wouldn't play it.Way to go Activision, your already shoddy reputation has dropped even lower with this lame stunt. I'll certainly think twice (make that three times) whenever I see a game published by you rip-off artists again!"
2,Why wasn't it like the console version?,"I was totally unimpressed by this game. The fighting was way to easy (just click a mouse button) The part where you could swing around in the city was cool, yet there was not that much to do besides swinging through hoops and collecting little things. Long story short I am selling the game and I wish that it was just like the X-Box one."
1,Beware,"No, I haven't actually played this (if you didn't check the date), but if your looking for the cool free-roaming (GTA like) movie tie-in DO NOT BUY THIS. This is a completly diffrent child oriented, very boring to anyone over the age of 7, type game. If you want the cool one, you need to play it on a console, as for Adult/Teen PC owners they got gipped."
1,Shame on you Activision!,"I took it back the next day. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! If you have a console, buy that game. The PC version is a watered down, horrible attempt to replicate the awesome console version. I'm not exactly sure why Activision did this, but I knew something was up when I saw this game sitting on the shelves before the release date. Again... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! You will be terribly disapointed. This is a horrible deception and the gaming community should strike back at Activision. Shame...(the 1 star is only because I had to put a rating, and there was no ""0"" option)"
1,Garbage,People who bought this game are idiots.. People who actually enjoy this this game are retarded.I hope youa er neither an idiot nor a retard
4,"Good reviews, false","Good Things: Lots of villains, fast wall climbingBad Things: Only swing on web targets, you can't climb to the top of most buildings, the game won't let you go everywhere, no statue of liberty, short game, no Vulture or Shocker(Unlike the PSP game), the fighting and web and zipping are all in one button, and each villain has the same kind of thugs(unlike the first game). This game is only worth the money if your an huge Spidey fan. The first game was sort of boring, but this one is worse. Please don't buy it (unless your a Spidey fan). I can't wait untill I get the PSP game because there will be more villains, more tricks that Spidey will do, more places to go (Including the Statue of Liberty), and you'll get help from Black Cat. If you don't have a PSP and you want this game, your outta luck. Because this game is not anywhere close to how good the PSP game will be. I only gave it a three star because I'm Spidey's biggest fan, and even now I only give three stars."
1,Sorely Disappointed,"I bought this game thinking it was going to be like what was advertised on TV. I made a huge mistake. The game is much too short and too linear for my tastes. Even worse, they tell you how to beat the bosses and which way to go. Thankfully, a week later, I bought a game that was much better to fill the void left from Spider-Man 2"
1,total rip off,"Ok, I got this this game 2 days ago nd i've almost already beaten it. 2nd I read a game review that said you do all these different swing moves but i can only do 1. that gets boring after 2 secs and then, they tell you how to beat the bosses at the start of a level! another thing, what happened to the cool combat and flashy graphics and what are they talking about you can go anywhere? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! spiderman 1 was bad enough but with spiderman 2 it got a whole lot worse!!! PLAY THE CONSOLE VERSION!"
1,"This ""game"" (I use this word lightly) . . . .","This game definately does not live up to its grand hype.Heck! This game doesn't even live up to what it takes to be a game. There are many things horribly wrong with this ""thing.""First, the single players is: easy, repetitive, last a whooping one and one-half hours, and has some very sketchy graphics.Secondly, something is terribly wrong when the console releases are accually pretty good and this one, well, isn't (that should almost be false avertisement). Finally, after you beat it and you think that you can ""free roam"" New York, News Flash.... YOU CAN'T. After you go so far on the lame-butt swinging system you recieve this wonderful message: ""you have no need to go here."" In conclusion, i suggest no one go out and spend their hard-erned money on this, unless they are little kids, or well, crazy about spider-man and don't own a console.As for Activision, stick to consoles unless you are making a new WolfenStein."
3,A suspense-filled chase through 1950's Harlem.,"A murderous racist cop trying to cover up hisdrunken mistakes and a black truck driver who'sthe only surviving witness have a suspense-filledchase through Harlem. Not always believable, butalways thrilling. A good introduction to the hard-boiled fiction of Chester Himes, and a piercinglook into the sources of racism."
2,Stick with Himes' earlier work,"Himes did a lot of wonderful writing that was not all about racism. In the Gravedigger Jones and Coffin Ed series, for example, people of all hues misbehave in all manner of outrageous ways. Race and racism are important to the stories, but they provide a background in which individuals are free to act honorably or not (usually not). In Run, Man, Run, by contrast, everything is easy. Black men good. Black men very good. White men bad. White men very bad. White policemen, even worse.There's a couple of ironies here. By his later years, Himes had been living and writing in Europe for decades. Somehow, American racism grew worse while Himes was away. The other irony is that Himes is never charitable with his black female characters. The book is a more accurate reflection of Himes' sexism than of America's racism.The wonder is that Himes wrote as many books and stories as he did that are so much better. No small accomplishment."
2,IMPOSSIBLE CAMPAIN GAME,"The campain is immposible!! I got this game thinking ""Wow a new worms game!"" boy was I wrong! the only reason I rated this a 2 is the multiplayer games, the campain stinks! Example: you start with 2 worms and the enemy has 5 worms with unlimited weapons while you have 2 prod, 1 fire punch, and 1 shotgun! It takes you 1,000,000 tries to beat most levels minimum! I really miss my $30.00 the 2D games were way better.Trust me save your money for Battle for Middle Earth,Stronghold 2,Rome: Total War, Age of Empires 3 or anything else!A 13 year old game PC game fanatic."
1,Awkward Gameplay,"I HATED this game. I don't how it plays on the consoles, but it's really hard to move your worms with any precision using the keyboard and mouse on the PC. I strongly recommend you do NOT buy this game for the PC!! A very frustrating experience."
3,This book has sample code in the internet.,"This book explains the simplifed concept of PC-Card and PCMCIA. but it is not enough to understand well. If you want to develop the PCMCIA card device driver in windows operating system. Please choice this book. also Peer-to-peer communication is not care of this book. But you can find the source code of this book. .... exactly It is difficult to find the source code to me.If you expect Windows NT or XP device driver, you need to buy the other WDM book to develop the Windows NT/XP device driver.also If you are going to develop the PCMCIA linux device driver. It is not good chioce for linux."
1,Book's software link is DEAD!!!,"After purchasing this book and thinking I would be able to download the utilities and source code mentioned in the book... Also, it appears as if they are going out of business... their domain name is listed for sale at the top of their homepage.... Save your money and look elsewhere."
1,"Completely worthless, online content is gone, and the book is nearly substance-free","I needed to work on a legacy PCMCIA driver and ignored the other reviews here on Amazon. They're right, this is a worthless book."
1,phone holder,Just didn't like the product. Hard to get the phone out of the holder and ddn't like the clip.
2,A big disappointing,"Everything in Yargo was made better in other books and this is the biggest problem of it. If the exception of the Venus part nothing was really interesting, all the characters with exception of Sanau were flat and uninteristing, i really didn't care of what would happened with Janet (maybe because I already know that nothing bad would happened to her). I expect more from it was a trully disappoint"
5,Whoever thought Susann could do science fiction?,"I got this in paperback in 1979 or so. It was published years after Susann's death. It seems she had given it to a publisher friend of hers and he ""lost"" it in his files. He rediscovered it years later and it was published once and seems to be forgotten. It's not a great piece of literature by any means but it's actually a funny, well-done soft science-fiction tale. Basically it tells about a woman who is ""kidnapped"" from Earth and all these adventures she has with various other beings in outer space. All in all it just turns out to be a love story! If you read ""Once Is Not Enough"" the ending of that sort of predicts this book. There's no sex, drugs or anything like that in this one. Just a sci-fi adventure love story. If you can find a copy it's worth reading."
5,So you think you know Jacqueline Susann?,"Well you don't. Not until you read Yargo. This is an amazingly good sci fi/love story. Janet, the heroine is probably the most complicated female Ms. Susann ever created and Yargo himself is perfect, literally, he's worshiped as a god by a whole planet. The book has humor, wit and hooks the reader from the very first paragraph. If you don't touch another Jacqueline Susann book give this one a chance."
3,One in a million,"I cannot say that this book would ever make my top 100 favorites of books read, but it is definitely one in a million. I read this book as a teenager and years later recommended it as easy reading material for my own teenager. Even though I had not read the book in decades, I was still able to describe it to my own daughter in vivid detail, down to the caption ""Tomorrow, look to the skies"". That says something in itself. I must have enjoyed something about this book in order to recall it so easily. It's also why I've come looking for a new copy thirty years later. I miss having it in my library.Barbara, EditorEDITandPROOFREAD-WorthReading"
2,I gave it 2 out of respect...,"I had recently gotten into Ms. Susann's books, which I loved. This was the one exception. It is extremely different from the rest...being a of solid campy ""B"" sci-fi movie quality. Janet has little essence as the main character. She is uninteresting and too slight for her role. The Yargo, which are advanced thirty thousand yrs to Earth, are almost laughable. I think that perhaps there was a reason this book was ""lost"" in her time. Maybe, after seeing what she was capable as a writer, was put on the shelf and never meant to see the light of a day. I would not have been surprised in the least."
2,just so so,"Well , I don`t read many books these days and I may be a little unqualified [I am a handyman] BUT..... a bit light on for reality! . Book is conceptual and lacks punch from REAL examples or photos. Enjoyable read at bedtime but dont expect your underground house NOT to leak.Probably a great house for a desert. Also not terribly 'green' as it relies on masses on re-enforced concrete. At least the author accepts that a ''normal '' roof may be a fair compromise.Why not build above ground with lots of sensible insulation? Builder beware."
2,underground homes books,Ordered 3 books on this subject and found this one to be the least informative.
4,Impressive but....,"Rifle looks and feels very nice.... rather heavy..... adequate FPS and accuracy, But it stopped cocking after 60 shots or so, literally the second day i had it. Still waiting to see what the seller is going to do...."
3,Good for Marketing Departments,"This is good for marketing departments, rather difficult to apply in sales. A little too simplistic. However good to read."
5,BE WARNED THIS COMES IN PIECES,I got this thing from melissa and doug because my kids like sea creatures and stuff but when it came it was in like 100 pieces or something and you have to put it together yourself well I say that is a bunch of horsecrap my kids are not some little third world sweatshoppers who like to set around and assemble toys for Americans they ARE Americans. Next time Melissa and Doug have an idea for a toy they need to get it assembled before they sell it. I am still given it all the stars because I really like the pretty pictures on in but this is horsecrap.
4,Gift,I gave this to a friend's grandson. He was very happy when he received it. I have not had a chance to find out how he likes it.
5,Great fun for children,"Ive purchased 5 melissa puzzles for my granson. I like the huge floor puzzles. My grandson loves them all, re does them over and over and in the case of this puzzle, names all the fish, and asks about those he doesnt know. Much more educational than i expected. He is 3 and a half and has no problems with doing this puzzle - 3 or 4 pieces are initially laid for him to follow."
5,Great Puzzle!,Great puzzle for my kids. Ages 3-6...lots of fun for us to do together because it's big and challenging for my kids. Durable and easy to clean!
2,Good not Great,"Lasted longer than most of my 90lb black labs toys but was destroyed in a matter of days. He greatly enjoyed it though,while it lasted, loved the squeaker. These toys are better made than most, if you have a smaller, less rough dog, it would probably work out great."
2,unhappy,Not unhappy with the product My two medium size dogs Love them. I'm unhappy with the company. Buyer be ware I ordered from the picture thinking pink rabbit not so. Received a blue one. Contacted them they said I could return it....great you think....not so at my expense. I know dogs do not see in color but I do and I wanted what I ordered. Like I said buyer be ware....
2,Dissapointing Changes,"Oh boy, a recolor...That's just about all that seperates this from the original bohrok, which is why I didn't buy any Kal, or many sets after that. I'd wait till later in '05 to buy a Bionicle set if I were you."
3,Skidmore Alum,"let me start by saying I have not read this book yet but as a Skidmore Alum i am interested to read this book as i am sure there will be some things that are taken way out of proportion and some things that will be spot on as with most books. Even people who went and subsequently graduated from Skidmore, have different experiences. I am sure my experience as a member of the Wombats, Chorus, Dance clubs and other stuff will be different than someone who was involved in all academic stuff. I am interested though. Thanks for putting our little school in the biggest online retailer!!"
5,Quite simply the best Catholic Scriptural Apologetics book around!,"Armstrong started his research of the Catholic faith as a pious low-liturgy Protestant. His initial investigations were undertaken for the sole reason of disproving the Catholic faith. Yet, God had other plans for him, and in a few short years he had entered the Catholic Church and became one of the leading Catholic apologists in the United States.This book is inspiring to Catholics and those wishing to enter the Church, and it serves as a challenge to all non-Catholics. Anyone who reads this book unbiasedly (unlike the previous reviewer, who clearly carried their own biases into the reading of this book), will come to see the truth of the Catholic Church.Highly recommended!"
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"I absolutely love Reeses Peanut Butter Cups. Because I could not find the Big Cups locally, I searched Amazon and ended up ordering two boxes from the Online Candy Shop. Given that selling chocolate via mail-order is their business, I figured it was safe to do so, in spite of the gross shipping charge ($12.00).The only thing ""good"" I can say about the end result is that the candy arrived quickly - end of ""good"" remarks. The outer carton they arrived in was crushed at both ends. Even the inner carton showed signs of the crushing. And apparently the chocolate had gotten so hot it caused the chocolate to stick to its paper covering, making it impossible to remove the candy whole. Well, I learned my lesson. Never again will I order ANYTHING from the Online Candy Shop. You have been warned!!!"
2,"Nice set, but not as described","Overall, it was a very pretty bedding set; though the comforter is very thin. My biggest complaint is that the product description mentioned the inclusion of valences and panels; however in actuality these have to be purchased seperately. Had I known that initially, I wouldn't have bought it. There is better quality bedding out there for a lesser price."
4,"Ninefinger- ""Ninefingered""","Mike Dean of COC. Rich Hoak of Brutal Truth. 'Nuff said. No? Okay- real solid, heavy hardcore from this power trio (Mike-bass & vox, Rich-drums, and Paul Maiello- guitar). Comprised of, I believe, three ep's, this full length disc is a must purchase for any fans of COC and Mike's other offshoot project Snake Nation. My only complaints- the awful cover of Motley Crue's Dr. Feelgood, and the production could've been a little thicker. Minor gripes aside, good stuff here."
3,"POOR DVD QUALITY, BUT GREAT PERFORMANCE","If you're expecting to buy a great CD you won't be disappointed. The CD sounds great and every reviewer of this release agrees on the great material, BUT..... if you are expecting a great DVD, well, I was quite disappointed in the sound quality. Is it even in stereo? The ambience is poor and the low end is washed out. Compared to current DVD concert releases, this is like a poor VHS.You can't argue about Jose's performance, though. It's GREAT !"
5,"A thorough, accessible and indispensable resource on algebra","This two volume set is by far the most complete text on abstract algebra available. Rich in detail, a wealth of examples and clear yet concise explanations provide the reader an accesible source to deepen his understanding of abstract algebra. Spindler conveys his love of algebra and a desire to reveal its riches to the average student. If you've relied on Hungerford's / Lang's Algebra or Warner's Modern Algebra, this text is the last text you will need."
1,Taste,This product was terrible and I would never purchase it again. I have lived in Japan and eaten at great Asian restaurants and this doesn't even resemble the taste of Mongolian Barbeque.Don't waste your time.
4,Very interested,"I was read the last edition of this book, but now i prefer the new edition that contains more topics regarding reparation under the international human rights law.Thanks."
5,Every teacher must read!,"This book is more than a bag of tricks, it does away for the need for a bag of tricks with a comprehensive, dynamic system for caring classroom discipline. This system works to extinguish unwanted behaviors every teacher faces, instead of dealing with the same thing over and over again.Information includes: How to set up your classroom to maximize teacher/student interaction, the first day of school, limit setting for dealing with disruptions and back talk, responsibility training, and putting the lid on. If you've heard of different aspects of Fred Jones' ideas, such at PAT, you need this book to implement them correctly. Simply a must read."
3,A few good techniques in a big book.,"If you are looking for a book packed with tools for making your teaching better, this is not it. The book contains a few really good techniques with a lot of additional information that is not really helpful. It also contains much of the exact same information that is covered in Tools for Teaching. The techniques are also more appropriate for middle school and lower grades in my opinion."
2,so boring,"First, the book has a very long unnecessary introduction. it actually starts at page 85.and then , the next 100 pages discuss what can you do in only one situation ( two student are talking while they should do their class work) and to summarize what to do just take a deep breath, look at them, yell out their names,walk slowly to them....etc). 100 pages just to discuss this situation. what about the other problems we face ( aggressive behaviour, crying, complaining, arguing, lying, lateness, sleeping, whining.....etc).to be honest i didn't finish the book. in fact i consider my self a hero reaching page 185.i recommend another book called (elementary teacher's discipline problem solver) i know it is for elementary but it works for high-school also. after all they are just a bunch of kids."
5,This is the best book I ever read.,This book is a must for teachers. It is tremendous. I would like to contact Fredric Jones to ask him to give training to the teachers at our school.
5,HISTORY THE WAY IT SHOULD BE,"Parts of this book are also in the paperbacks C'ÉTAIT LE XXe SIECLE published in 1999 on POCKET.I have read tome 2 of L'HISTOIRE EN QUESTION.It is fascinating throughout,complete with pictures.DECAUX here choose 9 stories that are all unique in their own way.Let me say this,if we had history teachers like MISTER DECAUX in highschool,we would have been in heaven.Unfortunately,it was not the case.What distinguish mister DECAUX from many other historians,his is ability to communicate his passion for the subjects.He manages to condensate his stories without losing grip of their ambiguous nature.Once you lay your hands on one of his books,you may want to read them all.The greatest compliment any writer can receive."
2,pieces & picture too small,"This puzzle would have been better as a 500 piece, rather than 1000 pieces. Or, the least the manufacturer could have done was supplied a larger picture to use as a guide. Lots of details are lost in the picture they provide (on the cover of the box), making this puzzle more difficult than it should be to put together."
3,passing time,Bought this because my boyfriend works for John Deere and I love puzzles. Not the quality I was looking for but it was still a fun puzzle.
3,"Decent overview, but few details.","This book is a comprehensive list of multicast technologies and vendors. If that's what you're looking for, it's decent. But if you are looking for an in-depth discussion of HOW these protocols work, this is not the book for you. For example, the discussion of multicast routing is cursory and confusing. And the part of the book on multimedia protocols feels like filler."
3,Great product but...,"Great puzzle rack, however... only the Melissa and Doug peg puzzles fit in here... if you are buying it to store your chunky Melissa and Doug puzzles (as I mostly was), it won't work, they are just a little too wide..."
3,fits 9x12 puzzles,"According to the M&D website this rack holds the 9x12 size puzzles, not the 11.75x15.5 inch puzzles. I don't own this product so please ignore the star rating I gave it."
2,Wire racks not great,I should have purchased a different type of rack. There are only specific puzzles that fit on the rack. It is doing okay but I really wish I had spend the extra money for the wood racks.
4,Works good but not for all puzzles,"I bought the puzzle rack thinking it would hold all of our Melissa and Doug puzzles, but the chunky puzzles don't all fit and they require an extra space. The 12pc puzzles don't fit at all. All other puzzles fit wonderfully."
1,Awful. Annoying. Tedious.,"One of the most annoying features of this remarkably annoying book is that it is written in the second person.YOU enter the room. YOU look around at your excruciatingly catalogued trendy brand name possessions, deeply symbolic of your materialistic shallowness. YOU decide to attend a Zen sesshin.One can almost hear the author congratulating himself at having found a rhetorical trope that symbolizes the death of the ego, the self, the ""I."""
4,An excellent read. Entertaining & (painlessly) informative,"I really enjoyed this novel -- found it hard to put down. Good twists, interesting characters of types that I hadn't encountered before. The ending surprised me, but since I don't want to spoil it for you, I won't tell you in what way I was surprised. If you like smartly written, intelligent characters in interesting situations, there's a good chance you'll like HUNGRY GHOST."
3,interesting...,i enjoyed the pull between the desire to become whole and transformed and the pull of human desire. written well.
2,Just wasn't what I expected,"Personally I really didn't enjoy this dvd/documentary at all. It's been a while since I last watched it. Actually I've only watched it once...the day I received the shipment. I bought this dvd in anticipation of the winter cycling season and thought that I could watch it through the winter on the trainer. It just couldn't hold my attention...not even on the trainer. I'm sure it can insipre some, but just wasn't for me."
4,A cool plane,"Here is the thing about r/c planes. You need space and skill if you want to fly an r/c plane. This plane flies okay, but you have to learn the basics of controlling a plane. The plane is pretty durable, although some splits in the wing.I accidently crashed the plane real fast right into a tree branch and it got stuck. Finally, when we got it down, the plane really had no damage except some ripped off paint.If you are interested in buying a good quality plane, this is the plane for you. It is a pretty good price, and can withstand some of your first crashes."
3,"Lots of diamonds, medium amount of death.","Decent transfer. George Nader is totally believable as a g-man - wish I could say the same for his English accent which nearly murders the whole film. Also the script has his character-in-a-character act completely annoying and totally suspiciously (also, admittedly very valiant in protecting the leading lady) in an attempt to ferret out who is the chief villain. A few weird exploitation twists offer some interest, and the end offers unusually honest, yet ambiguously sexual twist on the typical 007-and-girl-go-on-vacation ending. Did they decide to be friends with benefits forever? Or just BFF? Unclear."
5,Un disco impresionante,"Uno de los mejores discos de La Renga. Me hace acordar a ""Bailando en una pata"", pero aquí se puede apreciar más variedad de temas y el sonido es diferente. Si ya escuchaste otros discos de esta banda y aún te falta este, pues te lo recomiendo."
4,works good,"Does what you ask reasonably well.I got this product because it met four requirements. Uses same battery as two of my still cameras. Has genuine optical stabilization (I need this for technical reasons), has a reasonably long zoom range with decent optics, and its digital.Not many complaints yet. Like most of the new gadgets, it takes a while to learn to use all the features. Build quality is good.Main complaint is that the batterlife is kinda short with the batteries that I swap out from my still cameras.The night function is not so thrilling. If you want excellent low light capabilities, look elsewhere."
3,1 Tragic Flaw For Me,"Wow, those 1st 2 reviews really are useless... I'll try to be brief but slightly less useless.Anyway I researched this TV and was drawn to a 1080p display over 70""... about time the true HD stuff got big. The picture is excellent but like most DLP things can look a bit jaggy if you watch something with a lot of small moving parts, like say a basketball game. As with other DLPs this display struggles bit with that. The contrast is excellent with a very sharp picture. Colors seemed great.The one tragic flaw that prevented me from getting this was that it won't receive from a 1080p source. Sorry but I'm looking for something that will receive native 1080p from a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player (or PS3)."
3,"Very good TV, but best to wait, or look elsewhere","The reason to shy away from this one? It does not accept a 1080p signal via HMDI. But, it does have a beautiful and bright image. Those that don't plan to upgrade to HD-DVD or BluRay (don't do it yet though, wait for 2nd generation players, the current ones seem slow to ""boot up"")in the next few years will be very happy with this set (until then).If you are shopping for a TV this large, you are better off to wait a few months for some new models to come out. If you insist on a DLP television now, check out HP models. The 58"" MD5880n and 65"" MD6580n are able accept a 1080p signal via HDMI."
4,Clarity at a Cost,"As a displaced resident of lower Plaquemines Parish and a guardsman mobilized for aid, I have seen and heard a lot about Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. This book was great to finally put to rest so many rumors (some of which I believed two years later) and bring light to facts that were buried under sensationalism. The only problem I had with this book is that it jumps around too much. However, with the wealth of information and the thousands of people involved the author did an outstanding job tying as much as he could together, but there were just some frayed ends."
2,"Good story,Bad narrator!","We had heard bits and pieces of this story being read on NPR (National Public Radio) and really looked forward to listening to the entire story.The narrator for the copy we purchased was awful ~ there were so many mis-pronounced words, it was almost unbearable to listen to.Next time, either get a ""local"" to narrate or make sure that the narrator knows how to pronounce all of the cities, streets, and local references correctly.Thanks, Diane"
1,book- never received,I have still yet to receive the book I ordered. The shipper e-mailed me he had the wrong address??? How is that possible? Now he has correct address and claims he shipped it. I still do not have it. I will not be purchasing from Amazon again.
4,Practical oriented,"Among the web developers community there is a serious lack of knowledge related to databases, unfortunately many books on the subjects are dry and quite academic, so this book is especially welcomed. Compared to what's available on the market it's much more practical oriented and, even more important, focused on the web. Definitely a good book that could help the average web developer; there is just some redundancy, maybe because it was written by multiple authors, apart from this an excellent choice for people that prefer practice to theory"
4,Good but not perfect,"This book is great if you're looking for a new opinion of All Quit on the Western Front. If you have the read the book for a school assignment but don't want to, don't think this book will get you out of it. This is simply a study guide for the real book."
5,The False Hopes,"I think that this book provides us with great notions about how the war crushed an entire generation of people; people who were hopeful, ambitous, and progressive. The story is about more than one man; it is about an entire generation"
3,School,We are reading this book in school. Although there are gorry parts in the book. I think that it gives you a real feel for what would happend if you were in a war.
1,The book is poorly written and drags on too much.,"I have just read the book, I being Dr. Shapiro, world famous book reviewer,found that the language used in this book is extremely inapropriate and that the book seemed as if it would never end."
5,death at a young age,"a must for the youth of today ,a tragic waste of young lives by a country,s leaders . a war of mud sweat and tears ,never again we hope"
3,Not enough,"This book was good, but there was not enough blood and guts. They also skipped over a bunch sexual scenes. Guys like this kind of stuff."
5,You can always count on Rosie,"This book is perfect for every Beanie Babies collector! It offers a detailed Beanie history, counterfeit information, names, pictures, variations, poems, birthdays, checklists, detailed explanations.... the list goes on and on. The only problem I have with this book is the price guides. Luckily, they're given in ranges, but since prices of Beanies change daily, you have to take the prices with a grain of salt. Still, since Rosie uses prices ranges rather than actual figures, you can assume it's pretty close. The book is still a must for every avid collector."
3,It was wonderful! It really gave me more info on beanies!,I don't really remember but all I know is i want to go back to my friends house to read it again!
5,The best Venezuela map you can buy,"International Travel Maps have established themselves as the definitive national maps, at least in the Western Hemisphere. This is no exception - it is without a doubt the most authoritative national map of Venezuela. Watch out for the forthcoming maps by Emilio Perez though. Rarely encountered in Venezuela, you will need to purchase this before leaving. The map is topographical with good political information, accurate roads and some environmental and cultural information to boot."
1,Whiteny doesn't know how to design,"Although the aesthetic is nice, the spray bottle is crap- the nozzle when turned for a stream just leaks and when turned towards a mist produces a weak stream and lots of mist. The top, where it is suppose to screw on is ill fitting and often pops off. I am going to need to replace this sprayer in no time at all"
3,Spray nozzle not adjustable enough,"Generally, these were excellent, but the spray nozzle was not adjustable enough. I was hoping to be able to get a fine mist from them, but the best it could do was a coarse mist that would include larger drops."
2,Picture is misleading,The picture of the bottle(s) on Amazon is misleading...looks like 3 bottles in a package (much like another brand's 3-pack of 24 oz. spray bottles for $4.99 on the same screen). The bottle I ordered (thinking I would receive 3) was $3.29 for only 8 oz. And when you add shipping...should've gone to CVS!
3,It's a Spray Bottle...,"It's a bottle for gawd's sake. It sprays. So far it does it's job. It is a convenient size. However by the time you add shipping it is an ""expensive spray bottle"". Be sure you check the total first before you click PAY or you will."
1,bad advertising,You folks have screwed me out of money by false advertising showing 3 bottles at that price when it's only one.NEVER AGAIN
1,I should've read the reviews.,"The picture clearly has 3 bottles in it. The product description clearly says ""-Three color assortment."" But I got 1 bottle. That's really lame and kinda pisses me off."
2,Deceiving,Photo shows 3 bottles so I ordered 3 ( thinking I would have 9)but was charged 3 times for 3 bottles. At those prices I could have to Walmart's. I feel ripped off.
1,miss leading,"I was going to purchase these spray bottles, thinking I would receive 3 glad I read the reviews. Thank you"
2,Misleading,I have no idea how good the bottles are. My complaint is that the picture shows three (3) bottles for the price listed. You get only only bottle. The price listed was okay for three bottles but ridiculous for only one. I obviously returned the bottle for a refund.
3,love the flavor hate the caffeine,We are a cliff bar eating family. We bought a case of this new flavor and all tried and liked it. The second time I ate one I noticed that it said it had caffeine in it. Turns out it is about the same amount as a can of soda. Since we don't let our kids have said it's out for the majority of our family. Keep that in mind when ordering.
4,Pretty tasty Clif Bar,"In the world of protein bars, clif bars are not too bad. They tend to have that protein flavor to them and don't have a ton of eye and texture appeal (though there are a few ""crunchies"") I liked this cool mint chocolate flavor pretty well, though. The bits of crunch were there and the mint and chocolate were great, yet not over-powering. This is a great energy bar and I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could. The main downfall is that you just have no clue what you are looking at when you scrutinize the conglomerate of chewiness that is a clif bar. It's just all kind of soft and brown"
5,Excellent for those needing an ActionScript Reference Guide,"Unlike some other reviewers, I was very satisfied with the quality of this book, but I bought it specifically for the sections (Chapters 14-30, literally half the book) written by Darrel Plant, which focuses on ActionScript.I've been a fan of Darrel's since his ""Lingo Programmer's Reference"", possibly the best reference book on programming in Director ever written (and happily soon to be updated in a new title, ""Lingo Line By Line""), and my advice to anyone wanting to move from Lingo to ActionScript (or simply to learn how to program in Flash) is to buy this book. As usual, one chapter alone (""Understanding the FSCommand System"") saved me hours of work and frustration, clearly explaining how to communicate between different movies or between the movie and browser environments.They're are probably better Flash overview and animation guides for the beginner. But this is the best ActionScript reference available today."
2,basics book,I found this book very disapointing for many reasons. It seems 200 pages short and does not cover anything special. it is 500 pages of wordy instruction. Peach Pits flash 5 easy quick start and pro guides are much smaller and have so much more material covered. The que special edition books usually have really inovative projects. I am sorry to say that this one is just not up to par
3,Unforgettable Characters,Rain is a stripper looking for love. Shelby is a confused battered wife and Taryn is a happily married woman who wants more out of life. These three women were very likeable. I found myself rooting for them as if they were real. I enjoyed this book immensly.
4,Gym bag,This bag is very good. Although I was expecting it to be a bit bigger. Overall it's a good bag for the money.
2,"cheap, lacks compartments","I ordered this bag since I was on a rush and it came first upon searching for ""running bag"" on Amazon. My take is two fold (i) Amazon should use Google for searches (ii) the bag is going back to Amazon right away.The bag's material is thin, certainly thinner than my previous cordura-based bag. The show compartments takes half of the bag. There are two front and back pockets but that's it. I'll keep shopping for a bag. This one doesn't make the cut for someone who needs a gym/running bag on a daily basis."
3,Slippery On/Off,It worked fine as far as heating the water. One day it was almost too hot to use. I did experience one significant design problem. The on/off control is done by twisting the end of the hose/spicket (a screw operation). This is fine until you have soap on your hands and the smooth ends of the screw operation are too slippery to turn. I had to grip each end with a wash cloth to get it to turn. It should have been designed with a grip mechanism on each side of the screw mechanism.
2,Great but,I have had mine a few years now and its held up pretty good. My biggest problem with it is the mouth is to small so it becomes a pain to refill. If they would just redesign the mouth to a larger one I would give it 5 stars. I have an MSR Dromedary bag and its so easy to fill up with water and it makes for an Ok shower as well.Mostly used for sailing and camping outback AZ and Utah
5,Great saw,I love DeWalt tools. I have used them for years and have never been disappointed. This is just another fine tool in their list of tools.
3,Dewalt cordless jigsaw,"I think that the overall product is good, but I changed the blade and the release knob broke and it has been in the Dewalt shop for the last two weeks. So I never got to use it."
5,never blue again,"This deck of Cards is a lovely pick-me-up on a blue day. It is a fun way of scaring away the depressions by simple ideas provided by the cards. You can do anything to make yourself feel happy, and the cards point out to you 52 ways of doing just that! I am going to collect lynn gordon's set of cards. Do yourself a favour and buy these cards...even when you are not in the mood to actually do what's on the card, just reading it will bring a smile to your face. And it makes a lovely gift!"

4,Clif Bar Crunchy Peanut Butter,"This is perhaps one of my favorite flavors of Clif bars.very filling and is the perfect complement to my vegan lifestyle, especially when I need a healthy, satisfying snack between meals.Amazon has the best selection and prices. I especially stock up when they have the special promotional deals."
2,Clif Bar-Crunchy Peanut Butter,"Should have tried them before ordering 2 cases! Rather dry and flavorless. However, I like that they're all natural and organic. Try one first or consider another flavor before ordering as many as I did."
2,Not up to his previous efforts.,"One would think that a book that includes a crack fish & wildlife law enforcement team, a rogue Army Ranger hunter/killer team, anti-government militia members, corrupt politicos, a real life panther, possibly Bigfoot, et al would be a crackling good yarn. Alas, such is not the case, as none of this gels into a real page-turner. The characterization lacks depth, the action is lifeless, the plot next to ridiculous. The climax really just peters out, but by that time the build-up is so lacking in zeal that one really doesn't care.There are too many coincidences in this book to be believable. The set-up with the cover story involving illegal snakes and spiders takes a lot of space in the book with very little pay-off or relevance. Ken Goddard's previous novels were all on the money, really holding the reader's attention. I guess all authors are allowed to fall flat once in awhile. I hope Mr. Goddard gets back on track with the next novel."
1,A no-thrill thriller written in plodding prose.,"Seldom have I resented the money spent on a paperback book. Double Blind is an exception. Mr. Goddard's past efforts were a credit to the genre. This attempt is lifeless!The writing quality reminds me of a C-paper in Writing Composition 101. The cast of charactures (good guys and bad guys)are cardboard caricatures. To compensate, the muddled plot moves at the pace of a slow loris.I'm sorry Mr. Goddard, but this is really a badly written novel. I look forward to your next effort."
4,Ergo Lounger,"This product, whilst not a top of the range lounger, is very good value for the money and is very suuportive for lower back. I would recommend buying."
1,Unsafe and Short-Lived,"The first thing I had to do with this product is duct-tape the legs to avoid having someone's fingers sliced off. Then, after only one season, the material completely ripped out - and I have the bruises to prove it! Do NOT purchase this product."
4,WAIT IF YOU HAVE WEIGHT,"It is very, very comfortable, for sure. A real delight.However, if you have any serious weight (I weigh 244## ), your weight will stress the stitching and the fabric will promise to pull over the long run. Mine has begun the processFor the price, I think I got a very useful aluminum frame and a little more. I will be getting some heavy duty canvass and some naval thread to supplement what the manufacturer sold me.In all, I am not unhappy with this product. I guess that's an endorsement, sort of...."
3,Versatile Chair,"I bought the ergo-therapeutic lounge chair due to a bad back. The pillows can be arranged to better support your back. It's somewhat combersome to carry, it weighs 15lbs which is significat if your walking a distance to the beach. I like the idea of being able to read while lounging, but eye glasses present a problem with the pillow. Its not quite as wide as I would have liked it to be, but it adjusts in quite a few positions. Overall I am happy with the product but I do think that it is way over priced."
1,"comfortable, But,","we left our Ergolounger sit outside and the fabric deteriorated to the point of shredding. So, we got to use it only one season. I wouldn't buy another because of that."
2,But my kids can't put their puzzles away!,"A great idea in theory, so our puzzles aren't stacked in a pile on the floor. And my kids enjoy seeing what we have, and sliding the puzzles out. But they CAN'T put them away! I even have a hard time getting them back in the rack! I bought this to organize our collection, and encourage the kids to clean up after themselves, but am left cleaning up myself after my kids are done. So what's the point? I'll be looking for one with actual shelves to replace this."
2,Only first certain size puzzles,"We own about a dozen Melissa and Doug puzzles. I normally love their products, but this puzzle storage case stinks. Only one of our puzzles fit in it! It is poorly designed and hard to get the puzzles in and out, especially if they have chunky pieces. I know in the description it names the size puzzle it fits, but it does not take into account the chunky puzzles which fit without the pieces in but are too high to fit when when the pieces are in."
3,"Only fits ""standard"" puzzles","I was very discouraged with this because it does not fit puzzles easily. I new that they had to be standard puzzles, but I was disappointed to find that even standard puzzles don't fit great. Rather, it will take some finesse to get in and out (and certainly more finesse than my daughter can muster). It may even be that it somehow bends when you put puzzles in, because it seems like one will go good, but then you try a second one and it doesn't work well, but you get it in, but then you can't get the first one out without a bit of muscle. Anyway, the end result if this means that, more often than not, it doesn't get used because it's a pain to use.On the flip side, my 16 month old daughter treated this as a chair on several occasions and it is still going strong, so I have to comment it for its durability. (And no, that's not why I think that it's bent, as this was a problem before she get into her ""chair"" phase.)"
3,Disappointed ... but found a solution,"I have a wooden Melissa & Doug puzzle rack and I needed another one. I decided to save money by getting the metal rack instead. I was very disappointed when it arrived and it doesn't hold my puzzles well. The rack is too wide for our wooden puzzles to stay on the ""shelves"" properly. One side of the puzzle will fall down to the shelf below, and none of my children were able to get the puzzles on the shelves themselves.It was very frustrating, and disappointing, as I've grown to love Melissa & Doug products. I was ready to send it back when I decided to try to squeeze the front edges inward to see if the puzzles would stay on better if the front edge weren't so wide. It has worked, though I think I'll probably have to do it again from time to time.My solution will work, but I do not really recommend this product. Save yourself some frustration and buy the wooden rack instead! The wooden rack has been problem-free for us for well over 5 years."
4,A Little Misleading,"Although I'm pleased with the product overall, I'm a little disappointed that this puzzle rack does not hold the Melissa & Doug wooden puzzles. It only holds ""standard"" size puzzles. Also it is shown with rubber feet in the photo and mine arrived without these."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted to organize the various puzzles that I had accumulated for my granddaughter so that she could find the puzzle she wanted and help with the cleanup when she was done. Unfortunately, the puzzles that we have will either fall out of the wires so that we cannot remove one puzzle without disturbing the others or they are too big so that they will fit into the case, but will stick out way too far. Before ordering this storage case, be sure to measure your puzzles to make sure that your puzzles will fit properly."
3,puzzle holder,"I scored this product low only because a rack isn't something fun for a child. However, I do like that you can keep all your puzzles organized. When I ordered it though I did not realize the large knob puzzle don't fit in this rack. It is hard to tell from the picture how large the openings are. Oh well, looks like I can fit in some others!"
4,Great puzzle organizer,This has really helped organize my toddler's puzzles! The wide slots allow for a variety of puzzle sizes and depths. He seems to play with them more since he can see them all and the pieces all stay together.
2,Puzzle Rack ~ Not what was advertised,"We were unfortunately dissappointed with our purchase. We loved that it showed rubber stoppers for saftey and for our hard wood floors ~ they didn't come with it. Further, Melissa and Doug puzzles don't fit."
4,I like it for it's intended use,"I think this puzzle holder is a great idea and when my son isn't around, it holds the puzzles nicely, however, when he gets to the puzzles, he takes the empty holder and slides around my hardwood floors with it and trys to wear it as a hat. I would recommend this for maybe ages 3 and up. My son is 2 and still has to investigate every new piece of furniture or anything we bring home."
4,Glad I bought this to store puzzles,"It doesn't fit the bigger puzzles, but I just have the standard puzzles anyway. I'm really glad I made the purchase."
4,Works for us,"This puzzle case fit all of our Melissa and Doug puzzles, and all we have are the chunky ones. They are a little tight, but once you get one in, the metal has some give and the rest go in fine."
2,Too hard to put puzzles in,"My son puts his puzzles away very nicely at school, so i wanted to buy a puzzle rack for home. This is too hard for him to put the puzzles back in. It holds the puzzles fine, i just have to be the one to put them back."
3,Okay but frustrating,I bought this for my 3 yr old in hopes it would keep her puzzles organized but accessible. Unfortunately there is no way she can put the puzzles in this by herself. I have to carefully slide each puzzle in and even then I don't always get it right. I guess I understand that the wires gradually narrow in so they can accommodate puzzles of different sizes but in the end it just makes it hard to put them in the rack. I wish now that I had just bought a puzzle rack with solid shelves. I always love Melissa & Doug things and while I am sure this will last I am not sure my patience will.
3,puzzles fall from slots easily,The concept is great but a little tricky for kids to get the puzzles in the slots correctly. Because the width is just slightly narrower than the puzzleboards the puzzles can be easily misaligned when inserting or drop if not completely pushed to the back of the rack. This does hold the sound puzzle by Melissa & Doug.
4,Great value to neaten up,"If you're looking for a way to organize your puzzles, this is it! Does a great job, and kids do pretty well getting them in/out. I wish there were a way to adjust the sizes of the racks, but I haven't seen anything like that."
3,puzzle rack,I desperately needed a place for puzzles. It's okay. My daughter has dumped the entire rack over several times while trying to get 1 puzzle out- and she is 4. It does the job. The chunky puzzles don't fit but I knew that when I bought it. It is not a bad product and it does some of the job I need it to.
5,Simple and works,"This is a great little puzzle storage solution. I have Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles, (small) Melissa & Doug peg puzzles (the alphabet, numbers, and fish colors), and other generic puzzles in it and it works fine. For the chunky puzzles, I did have to leave one space empty above them as they are slightly higher than the space available, but since I don't have twelve puzzles, there was room. They still go in and out easily. I noticed an immediate difference in my daughter's interest in playing with the puzzles - when they were just stacked, she mostly ignored them, but now that she can see them all, they were her new favorite toys. As others mentioned, the feet are metal and would scratch a surface, but I just put little felt feet on them (the adhesive kind) - problem solved. I don't think you can beat this for the price."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this along with several puzzles for my son for Christmas. It doesn't have the red, protective stoppers and it didn't fit any of the puzzles I bought. Waste of money."
4,Good but could be improved.,"This puzzle rack does the job and fits great into my cubby shelving that I have for their toy storage. However, what a shame that the sound puzzles, which they have several of do not fit.... Let's see if Melissa & Doug start to make something that can accommodate these popular sound puzzles."
1,Not that great,"I have had this for over a year and only used it for a few months. The top racks don't hold the puzzles right. The puzzles also come out of the rack to easily. I had this sitting on a dresser for awhile but even with a slight bump to it the puzzles would fall out, so I moved it to the floor and still had the same problem. Now I just have the puzzles stacked by themselves on the floor and it is better than using this rack. I say don't waste your money, just find somewhere to stack the puzzles and forget it."
2,Does not fit the puzzles,This storage case does not fit most of my puzzles. It was a waste of money. I was very disappointed.
3,Does the job if you have the correct size puzzles.,"I have several Melissa and Doug puzzles that are a tad bigger and are a tight squeeze. I wish it was easier for my son to put puzzles in himself. The bottom metal scratched my bookshelf, so I also which there was better coating on the bottom."
1,Tight Fit,The idea of this product is wonderful. We have collected quite a few M&D puzzles. However most of them will not fit in this storage shelf. It is so tight that it will scratch the puzzles and little hands cannot remove them. Including the puzzle featured in the photo. Find another storage option.
2,Misleading,"I ordered this rack to hold my daughter's standard puzzles that seemed to be piling up. After receiving it, and purchasing several Melissa and Doug STANDARD-sized puzzles, I was really disappointed to find out that their puzzles do not fit in THEIR manufactured rack.My husband is going to have to sand the edges of the puzzles so they can fit (too big by about 1/2cm).It seems that they would produce products that would actually work together, and be measured correctly!"
3,OK,"The capability of this organizer is not what I expected. Although it does hold about six puzzles, there is no way that I would be able to fit 12 chunky puzzles into this organizer. The spaces are not wide enough. It does keep the puzzles apart so that they can easily be taken out and put away, but not quite exactly what I was expecting."
3,reasonable,"This wire rack is great for storing puzzles, but not great if it's in a location that kids can access - when a child tries to pull a puzzle out of the rack it slides and can be really hard to line up a puzzle to put it away. GOod for storing for adult access or closet space - not so much for little hands to use."
2,Doesn't Fit Melissa & Doug Sound Puzzles,This rack would be great except that it does not fit Melissa & Doug sound puzzles (ones that play a sound as you put each piece in). The sound puzzles are thicker than the regular Melissa & Doug puzzles and the slots in the rack aren't far enough apart.
4,Quality Product for the price,"Got this shipped to our vacation place in FL. For sometime the kids enjoyed it. After a while it got boring... same tasting.If you can order the variety pack, do that.Packaging is neat and well done.Product itself is excellent and is well worth the price.Later."
3,"Good, but why all the salt?","While I love the idea of vege chips, these particular chips are entirely too salty. There was so much salt, in fact, that the flavor of the various vegetables was masked.On the other hand, these are better than the ""puffed"" versions.If Terra has--or would make--a low-salt/unsalted version, I would buy them in a hot minute."
5,A Gift of the Myriad,"In ""Call Me Myriad"" Constance Hester has given us a beautiful poetry book full of variety: the whimsical and the mystical, the practical and the fanciful. Her images leap off the page with color, texture, smell and feel. Each poem is a surprise that takes you to unexpected places. A review of the Sections into which the book is divided gives a flavor of the variety in store for you: Tongue, Raspberries, Rain, Shadow, Light, Picture, Money and Ambition. Give yourself and your friends the treat of accessible poetry where 'Women's Memories Are Long. Three thousand years ago, when I lived in Mesopotania, I wore my hair in one thick braid, never cut it my life long...' Long Live Myriad!"
3,Great learning tool!,"My kids love this game! It's easy to play & it teaches them simple facts about each state in the union. My complaint is the timer broke the moment we opened the game & the game company was not willing to replace it without a receipt (the item was a gift). Also, I think it would have been more beneficial to include a few more facts about each state on the game card pieces."
5,Great learning game,"I have a five year and I wanted her to get familiar with the states in her country. The only way I can get her to listen is to make a game of learning. I thought so much of the game that I ordered 10 to use as birthday presents for either boys or girls. Now, my daughter is learning her states and I have birthday presents without having to shop for each event. As we progress we will graduate to the Great States (senior)."
4,Torn dreams,"I Just recently purchased this game for my 3 and 5 year old.I was excited when they loved the game,they could point to a State and name it. It's educational and fun to play. They also liked the excitment of beating the timer. Althought the game was a great idea, the quality of the board was terrible. It began to tear and eventually torn in half. If they would change the material to something that would last, I'd consider repurchasing it."
2,Did not have all the pieces!,I am very upset that I ordered this game from this company only to receive a beat up box with everything missing except the cards and the game board! If I could give the seller less stars I would!
3,I wanted to like it!,"After all of the great reviews, I had very high expectations for this product. Unfortunately, we played it once when we first purchased it two months ago...and no one has mentioned it since. My husband was bored silly. My 5-year-old and 3-year-old who are game fanatics had a hard time staying in until the end. It's just not very fun, but it IS educational if you can get the kids to play it more than once!"
5,fun for 3 yr old & his daddy,"finally a board game that is fun for the 3 yr old and his daddy to play together. The timer is broken by the 3 yr old within minutes, but everythingelse is well made and designed. Great toy."
4,"Fun, but a little easy","This is a great game, however, it is a little easy for my 6 year old because the states and cards are color coded. It would be much better if the player had to read the board without the color key short cut. The cards are very durable and large, however, they are difficult to get out of the holders."
5,Educational and Fun,Our kids really enjoy this. Very durable. Teachers them quite a bit. They have had it over a year and still play with it.
3,Fiery 50s Fantasy,"A suave and oh-so-manly Bedouin chief named Tamerlane (Jeff Chandler) in on the hunt for a magnificent wild black stallion, Shazada (played by Diamond), who's rumored to be the fastest in the Tunisian desert. A fiery, tomboyish redhead, Princess Tanya of Tunis (Maureen O'Hara) is also after Shazada - she wants the horse so she can outrun two brutal brothers (Lon Chaney Jr. and Buddy Baer), one of which she is being forced to marry. No one in the cast is an Arab - not even the horse - but Flame of Araby is fun 50s fantasy.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,Consign this one to the flames,"Regrettably, there's no provision for awarding this a zero. This film was a waste of Technicolor and an even bigger waste of the talents of its two principals. What were the directors thinking when they put two A stars, Chandler and O'Hara, in this B picture? In their utterly unconvincing and unengaging portrayal of Arabs all the participants are obliged to backwards-speak almost every line of dialogue (""How come you . . . ."").My wife got it right when she observed that any minute Danny Kaye will pop up and show us, yes, we were right, it was intended to be a comedy. But it wasn't. Now that's laughable."
2,Permission to pass,"For me, it's all about the cast.Plot means next to nothing.I like Bogarde and Ava Gardner. I hoped that would be enough. It wasn't."
5,"Fantastic Job on Fantastic World, LP","Love Psychedelico, a band from Japan, recently moved to California to gear up for their first US release. The single Fantastic World, though a former release, had a spot on the album This is Love Psychedelico with its title track ""fantastic world."" The song is a mix of their native language of Japanese and English; Kumi attributes her awesome English skill to the fact that as a child she lived in San Francisco. Her vocals remind you of today's bands with female vocalists, sans Evanescence and Paramore. In fact, Kumi sounds like more of a mix of Janis Joplin and Jenny Owens Young. With the awesomeness of this single, any LP fan would be satisfied with this purchase."
4,"Good book, bit expensive...","All,This book is a little bit pricey. That being said it is a must for those of us doing hydrogenations/reductions. The choice of catalyst/solvent/temperature is extremely important. The book provides very good summaries and references if you need more details.Overall I am very happy with this book, it's one of the few good review books out there./Brian"
2,LESS THAN A SHOELACE?,"This book, ""Africa on a Shoestring, 9th Ed"" has a broad coverage; although its chapters are not as detailed as many tourists would expect them to be.Again, this book would have been of better psychic value, had its authors showed confidence in the sections they dealt with. Its 'information' became a wet blanket for me. Many readers who intend to visit African countries are likey to be discouraged by its relentless pessimistic approach. Its outlook is more critical than 'touristical'. The general impression is this: ""something good may not come out of Africa"". That is shameful! The term ""bush-taxi"", which was used over and over again, in lieu of a more cordial 'local-taxi' sounds offensive.I think that if written (or revised) without assumptive bias, this book would be of better quality and value to its users."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Earth has pretty much run out of that fossil fuel stuff that people were so reliant on, and the technology level on the planet has dropped considerably.The picking up of an alien signal along the lines of 'hi there, mind if we drop in for a visit sometime?' pretty much gets everyone to pull their fingers out and do something about it."
3,OK...but not great,"It is an OK book to locate marks on ceramics, etc...but wasn't nearly as complete a guide/reference as I had hoped."
3,Interesting but somewhat disappointing,"The fact is that science really can't yet answer any of the ""big questions"". As a result, those expecting to get some definitive insight from this book may be disappointed. Furthermore-- as you might expect-- trying to cover a dozen or so of the deepest issues facing science and philosophy in one book oriented toward lay readers, means that ""skimming the topic"" is a huge understatement. Probably my expectations were unrealistic, but nevertheless I was disappointed with how little new information I got from this book. However, it is a useful introduction to many topics of great interest, as long as you don't expect too much."
5,It Works,"Not much to say except it works, it arrived quickly and is of good quality. Now I can watch my old 8mm tapes on my TV. That's a good thing."
5,As advertised,"Two metal tins arrive individually vacuum wrapped, each with 48 condoms for a total of 96. Unlike stores where a 12-pack is a long giant string of 12, these condoms are paired for convenience. The tins themselves are sturdy and feel like they can definitely take abuse. It's hinged on one side so there's no need to worry about losing the lid."
1,The Truth,"Too bad the author did not really research the true story of Katherine Cross' death. That story too could be a best seller. It would point to the horrible men (not werewolves)that took advantage of young girls in small early Oklahoma towns. How people of authority took advantage of young girls and when they tried to take care of their mistakes only made worst ones,ending in the death of Katherine. When a grieving father could not get justice from the law, he could only speak out against those who killed his daughter. You see Katherine has many relatives still living in Oklahoma. They know that the paranormal bs is just that bs, with no fact."
1,This book is slander. Please do not promote it.,"The family of Katherine Cross has recently been made aware of this book. No one in the family was contacted or interviewed for this book. The story is fabricated, based on no truth, and ignores the true tragedy behind her death. Please do not purchase this book and further encourage the lies about the Cross family while they attempt to have this book removed from publication."
4,"Great toy, but tough to sort the shapes","My 2 yr old really enjoys playing with this toy. It is easy to take apart and put back together. The animals are thick but light and very well painted. It's too hard for him to really sort the shapes by putting them back in the pre-cut holes, however, because you can pretty much get any piece to fit in any hole. Also, because there are holes cut all over the boat, when it is filled with animals and you carry it around, the animals fall out easily. How we play with it now is to put all the animals in a pile, I find one, then I tell him to find the other. He likes playing with the toy that way. Then he also lines them up into rows. He loves the animals, but the boat doesn't get much use."
1,Mesmerizingly awful,"Ug! After staggering through the abysmal ""Dark Tide"", I decided to read this sequel because I couldn't believe that anyone would copy Tolkien so blatantly and so poorly. Surely, the plot of this second installment would deviate substantially from Tolkien. Amazingly enough, its even more of a Tolkien copy than the Dark Tide. And its a bad copy at that. Though the action and plotlines are virtually identical, McKiernan's story is completely devoid of the sense of mythic proportion that makes Lord of the Rings such a classic. Lots of people have imitated Tolkien's basic structure of a heroic fantasy, and that's fine. But copying the actual plot and characters is going too far. This is the only multi-volume fantasy series I have ever started and been unable to complete. Read at your own peril"
2,wait for the vidio.,"after reading book one of this trilogy I thought hey,it's not that bad a book,so I gave it 3 stars. But this second book which drags on and on was the longest 300 pages I ever read in my life.I've never unfinished a book in my life so i'm not about to start now,but please tell me book three gets better.If you want a good McKiernan book I would recommend DRAGONDOOM."
5,Excellent Piece of History now Preserved,Got this for my dad who was at this concert and it really took him back. Good sound quality and classic performances.
5,NEWPORT LIVE,"this was a great era prior to the outbreak in southeast asia it literaly set the stage, for the protest songs soon to follow a great nostalgic view of the past"
4,worth it for a few stunning pictures,"The subject of Easter Island was a perfect choice for Kenna to showcase his work. The mysterious beauty of the island is highlighted by his careful use of light and form. As usual, there are a lot of decent compositions with a few really stunning works. A fallen statue with a puddle in its eye reflecting the sky is one of my favorite photographic images of all time."
5,Great to have when planning trips,I really enjoyed this book and I know it will be great when we are planning our trips.
2,"If you use this book, you miss a lot!",I was disappointed in this book. My friend liked hers but I have found that a person misses the best sights and routes by depending on this book. I would not recommend it.
4,"Used it on our 10,000 mile vacation",We drove over ten thousand miles in the last two months going acros the country on Route 2 and returning on Route 20 plus many side trips and some time in the Maritime Provicences. I drove and my wife read about what was coming. We found it fairly handy. Many of his resturant suggestions were very good. We found several errors like the address for a resturant listed that turned out to be an old garage on a graveled back street one block long.
4,Informative Reading,A must read for a historical perspective of Black Baptists in the state of Georgia. Great effort was expended in researching for this book.
5,Love Is Forever,This book is a precious book for children of all ages. As a mother and teacher I recomend this book.
3,Delamination,"I actually like this drum a lot... but the first one started to delaminate after a week (the wood peeled off like a sticker on the side). Amazon made the return very easy and the second drum seems to be holding up better.I did try to contact Meinl - they they took 13 days to respond, by then Amazon had already replaced it."
5,You need this book.,"If you are not an expert, and most of us are not, you need this book. Not only for the recipes, but for the methods and tips. The best guide for which spices to use for which meat."
4,For Warrior fans,"The Ultimate Warrior was never as popular as Hulk Hogan. He never was as good of a wrestler as Ric Flair. Yet, he had something special. The WWE can bury him in a DVD devoted to him and the fans can mock him all day long, but if he wasn't popular enough, this figure would never have been made. The demand is there, especially from diehard Warrior fans. This is a fun figure, very representative of vintage Warrior in his glory days with the then WWF of the 1980's. The figure even comes with semi-lifelike hair, as opposed to the usual regular plastic formed hair of other such figures."
2,not my favorite,This CD is not my favorite-- I guess I just don't get it. I prefer something that takes you through all the stages of a yoga routine ending with easier more relaxing poses. This moves so slow throughout that I just want to lay in shavasana the whole time! LOL Inevitably I get up and put in another CD.
3,It is not the same as Yoga Sanctuary,"I was expecting More of the same from Yoga Sanctuary and was a little disappointed!! I still use the Shavasana on it, in order to have some quite time after my Yoga practice. Even if it is the Invocations."
3,Funny but...,"It's funny but it dosen't have a lot to do with the series itself. It's somewhat sexual, but that's my kind of humor. It's also more or less softcore pornography mostly of women. Maze TV is much less preverse, although it also has many sexual themes."
1,Perfectly insipid,"Saying a particular program is bad anime is not to say that it's not a good watch; I sat mesmerized by how god awful Macross 2 was. Maze, however, physically cannot be watched - I got roughly 5 minutes into it before I had to turn it off and hide the DVD at the back of my collection. Take my advice - do NOT buy this."
5,MEGA BURST SPACE!,"This series is great! It can be a little on the wierd side at times, but it is SOOO funny! ^_^ I LOVE the ending song: ""Junk Boy""! (singing to self...) *Don't touch, Junk boy, DAMEDAME lonely boy...* ^_^v"
3,It was rather....OK.,"I wasn't expecting too much from this anime, so I came in with an open mind. For the Maze series, the OAV's came before the TV series and thus with the OAV, you see situations that are more for adults and the TV series, things are toned down for the children who come home in the afternoons in Japan.With that out of the way, the series was interesting and it did keep my interest. It's not a superb anime but it was entertaining. The anime though is not as sharp as other OAV's that came out during the mid or late 90's. It seemed like TV quality OAV's.As for the DVD, special features include the first episode of the series (is this a special feature?) and a ""meet the cast"" which is nothing and the trailers which are from Hasegawa Katsumi's (screenwriter) other works.Perhaps if I had a DVD-Rom, I would say more positive things but at this time, if you can rent it...rent it. It is a good anime but again...nothing great."
4,Great comedic fantasy fun! Addictive!,"This is fantastic! It had me laughing out loud at their comedic antics including some gender-bending confusion not dissimilar to Ranma 1/2. My only complaint was that it's too short! I want to see more! At least though the main story is wrapped up in that time. the animation is very well done & the action is a fluid pleasure to watch. Well paced comedy mixed with action that was thoroughly enjoyable. The subtitles were well done (timing good & print clear, easy to read) & so was the dubbing which fit the characters very well in my opinion. The bonus first episode of the television series was a great addition & also fun viewing that added more background information. It definitely leaves you wanting to watch more. With the intriguing places & even more interesting characters it's easily one of my new favourites as well as being addictive!"
1,Not worth a penny of your money,"Ok, before you even think of buying this tape read the back, PLEASE. It's all about Maze, a girl who transforms into a guy a night. Maze has friends that help her fight Gorgeous, some evil guy. Male maze has some fun with Mixx, the king's daughter. They save the day. Everyone's happy. Blah blah blah blah blah blah-OH PLEASE! This is just a disgusting competitor of the wonderful Ranma 1/2 series. I was too ashamed to put this with the rest of my anime collection. Please by all costs - AVOID MAZE! If you want to watch some excellent anime series, I reccomend Evangelion, Ranma 1/2, Nadesico, and Original Dirty Pair."
4,Nice piece of furniture,I PURCHASED THIS COMBO SET I REALLY LOVE IT AND IT REALLY LOOKS NICE...THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS TWO OF THE KNOBS WERE MISSING AND A TELEPHONE NUMBER WAS NOT WITH MY UNIT TO GET REPLACEMENTS...I DO PLAN ON BUYING THE CHEST BY CHRISTMAS I WILL THEN REQUEST THE KNOBS.....
1,Sloppy Publication,"Adam's Amistad Argument is an eloquent work that deserves to be presented with care and in a manner that evidences that those who have assumed the task of publishing it have done so with respect for its form, content and meaning. This publication has so many typographical errors that it appears to have been carelessly slapped together and never to have been proof-read before being issued. The purchaser of this publication deserves better....John Quincy Adams deserves better too."
4,Short but sweet,"This 260 page book does what it needs... teaches you Perl from scratch and covers all the basic topics you need to write the scripts explained: write a web based clock, a basic page template parser (something that all programmers need to use more), processing forms (without using some large and slow 3rd party library), create a form based emailer webpage, a search engine, an app to grab other webpages to store them in a database and to search them, and finally a catalog/e-commerce script. This is a good starter book to go from nothing to intermediate programmer without feeling overwelmed with the material read."
3,Great for Entry Level Perl Programming on UNIX,"This book is good for individuals who have experience with HTML, UNIX, and some programming experience. It caters to people who have played a little with Perl programming, and want to learn more. It should be noted, however, that if you have no Perl experience, it will take much longer than 60 minutes to bring you up to speed."
4,Good learning,It is a good book where you can realy learn many things about United states while you practice your ennglish!
1,What a waste of money,"This plane was a waste of money. My son and I spent hours just trying to get the plane to fly. We ended up getting it up the air about three times for about a minute each time. And forget the paratroopers, they have to folded and placed perfectly in the plane. We only got 1 paratrooper to jump successfully.Also the plane was cheaply made, we spent more time reparing it than flying it.I would suggest that nobody else waste their money on this toy."
2,Not too easy to operate,"Putting it together didn't take a long time. One out of four ""flights"" ran successful. Nose of the plane damaged after the first outing."
1,Does Not Work as Intended,This plane only flys about 80 Feet from the Remote control before out of range. This does not give enough time or distance to do what the instructions say to do to manuver in flight. This was a total waste of time and money
5,Priceless!,"Thanks for the plush doll, my daughter collects these items, and she loves the plushies. Dont' be surprized if we have to but another."
1,Total discrase to humanity,"This is a terrible CD. Aweful music and completely misguided lyrics. This CD makes me question the fate of our great country if people actually review this music as good. If you even consider buying this CD, stop and rent the movie Farenhype 9/11. The creators of this god-aweful CD and those who embrace it should stop now because your going to be pretty embarrased in the years to come."
5,Platinum Skin cell phone cover,I bought this cell phone protector for a friend because her phone was getting scratched.The price is really nice compared to the Nokia store.Plus its has a tight fit and it doesnt cover the screen or speakers like some cell phone covers.
1,Don't trust David Little Elk,"IN the past I have order Mister Little Elk's Lakota teaching course ($230 absconded via Paypal with no possibility of recovery, Oct 27, 2004, Transaction ID 8EM08787XB5393341), expecting to receive the product in the future.With a 4-6 week lead time, I would be afraid that Mr. Little Elk will steal from you as he has from me & others. There are plenty of Lakota CD's to teach songs out there which are better. I suggest the Dave Swallow Jr series, John Around Him's (if they get back in print), and any of the Rosebud Porcupine or White Horse Singers series."
4,Reed is annoying,The show is great and interesting but reed is just annoying. Most of thier tornado shots are pretty cool and the info you get on how these storms grow and move is amazing. If your into weather or a meteorologist this show is up your ally.
5,"So good, it's hard to believe they are good for me!","Soft, chewy, chocolaty, yummy. What else do you need to know?"
3,Good Overall.,These are very filling and go well with a glass of milk. I also ordered a mixed flavor box. My suggestion is to stay away from the chocolate brownie flavor. It is my least favorite of the bunch. It sounds tempting but isn't.
5,African Sunshine and Shadows by Susan Jahme,"Jahme definitely has a gift for poetry. I personally liked the poems that told a story best. She has keen insight into the details and struggles of life in Africa. One special touch in the book that I haven't often seen elsewhere are short definitions and explanations following certain poems. Some of the place names, events and people were unfamiliar to me and these short definitions really brought me closer to what she was talking about. As for the poems with the explanations, I felt as though I understood where her inspiration came from, which in turn inspired me. For example, one poem that is good in itself becomes great when you realize that it was inspired by looking at a child in Cape Town who was homeless due to his parents dying from AIDS."
5,A Skillful Poet,"It took me a while to read the poems in this collection because I wanted to take the time to think about each phrase that had been written. Susan Jahme's descriptive passages were powerful and to the point. I actually felt like I was standing there listening to the roar of the Victoria Falls and to the low hum of flies on animals as they gathered at the waterhole. I'm not really a big poetry person, but I did enjoy this book."
5,great for the newbies of card magic,"contains all the easy and basic slieghts you need to become a jedi master of cards. includes live performances and way more material than what was originally adverstised on this dvd. miller is also a master coin man who is right up there with eric jones, so if you can, get his coin work along with jones and you will be well on your way."
2,Bad bad femdom!,"Woman with a problem, man with an attitude. How unfortunately common this is to the world of femdom erotica. A sad ending and a disappointment in its more passionate moments."
2,Botched attempt by British Intelligence Officer,"The Venlo Incident covers only a few pages. The rest of the book is a fanciful description of Best's five year experience in Sachsenhausen concentration camp.He mentions that Reichsfuerer Heinrich Himmler pays him a perdonel visit in his cell. ""Have you any complaint?"" ""No Reichsfuerer.""""You certainly have been able to ascertain that the stories of attrocities as described in the British White Book were nothing but Jewish inventions."" ""I am sorry Reichsfuerer, the conditions are even worse.""A true story? I find it difficult to believe"
5,Top,"Order was placed, email sent to seller for confirmation of address as Amazon botched it up as unable to follow simple address format outside USA, confirmation back from seller that book will go out to indicated address and book arrived at my parents not in 3-6 weeks but after 5 working days. Parents took the book, dad even read it before forwarding it to friend who wanted it and was very pleased by the quality of the item.Super seller and can only recommend him/her."
4,"Excellent book, particularly relevent for current foreign po","WHile Dr. Cottam focuses on Latin America, the application of Image theory here is an excellent example of the risks and benefits of Image theory. The case studies provide excellent background information on the history of US relations in Latin America, particularly if one is less than familiar with the actual cases. Dr. Cottam demonstrates how Image theory is particularly useful for both explaining and understanding foreign policy decisions. While Image theory does not attempt to explain everything, it seems, through this book, to focus on the determinant levels of analysis. In combination with other research, Image theory as presented in this book seems to merit extra attention in the near future."
5,Excellent Gate,The One-Touch Pet Gate 150 is excellent! I matches my hardwood floor and is attractive. I especially like that the door swings both ways for easy accessibility.
5,"The ""Ultimate Pet Gate"" that really is the ultimate pet gate.","Over the years I have purchased several ""pet gates"". While some worked and some didn't, the ones that worked didn't work long due to poor manufacturing or shoddy construction. This pet gate by Richell is the ultimate pet gate, it's built to last. Richell or Amazon packed the gate well for shipment, it's very obvious someone took the effort to make sure this gate arrived in pristine condition. Assembly was quick and easy with great instructions. The door is easy to open (using a top mounted latch) and close with a solid ""latching"" mechanism. The gate almost seems to belong where we installed it. The only drawback is the need to step over a bottom frame (only a couple inches wide).. Once you get used to it, there is no problem but you need to watch your step the first few times you paas through the open gate. Shopping for a ""pet gate""? Look no further."
5,dunkelgraue lieder,"I am not a professional critic,just a fan of ludwigs.I had the incredible pleasure to see him perform ""dunkelgraue lieder"" in concert and all I can say is this is the best money you will ever spend!It will make you laugh and it will make you cry,in particular the song der alte graue wolf!"
2,A wasteland,"This is a very dissapointing book by Richard Powell.It traces a history of a company up into the age of corporations, then pollution and the possible high incident of cancer caused by chemicals in the town of Lacewood. Parallel to this is history is a woman dying from ovarian cancer, possibly due to the effects of the chemicals from the factory. The history of the company and the change in doing busnines over 100 years and the changes required to keep the company above water. The history of this company driven to form a corporation involves a history going on all over the US. As a history lesson, it is boring and repetitive, poorly edited, with little in depth characteration. The story of the woman dying of cancer is excrutiating and except for the heroine, the other characters are not developed. His books do follow a formula which worked with such a novels as Three Farmers becomes increasingly ineffective. He needs a fresh new start."
5,Imbeciles!,"Have any of you anti-GAIN people *read* the freaking book? So much tut-tut finger-wagging at Powers for being anti-Capitalist . . . you might as well say: ""I read twenty pages. And not very well."" Powers is onto to something so much more impressive, nuanced, and complicated than being pro- or anti anything, as the learned (and, needless to say, resoundingly capitalist) gentlemen at Business Week realized, selecting GAIN as one of their best books of the year. To that I offer this: Read GAIN. It's a masterpiece."
5,"brilliant, absolutely brilliant",Big business builds to a crescendo. Human life struggles and slips away. A poetically told epic for the millenium.
2,A very disappointing novel,"Galatea 2.2 and Goldbug Variations are two of the best contemporary novels I have read, so I was excited when Gain was released. However, this book was a major disappointment. I thought Powers provided a plausible history of Clare Corporation, and his description of what a cancer patient seems realistic (though not having cancer myslf, I can't be certain). However, the novel lacked the intellectual brilliance of his previous novels, and the prose was less dazzling. I realize a lot of people find Powers' other works difficult, but Gain lacked the qualities that make him such a unique writer. In addtition, the plot of Gain provided no tension or drive. This wasn't a terrible book, but wasn't what I had hoped for after Galatea 2.2."
1,American business could never be this boring.,"Gain is a huge bore . After reading that Powers was a master of the game, I tore into Gain only to find myself ploughing through what read like an endless press release written by someone who knew nothing about the reasons why American business is such an immense wealth producing engine.If you want the point of view of a suburban Willie-White-Shoes,the sort of fellow who subscribes to public TV,thinks Brazil should be saved from capitalism etc.,then by all means try this Powers book. But this is business from the bottom up and in no way reflects its reality.By the way, the prose is turgid ."
1,Powers is sadly mis-informed,"I find it extraordinary that Powers and other leftists still have 19th century, and in some cases, medieval, views of capitlism, economics and class. Yet they do, and while they are still complaining about imaginary explotation and mythical robber barons, they fail to recognize (or refuse to) that socialist Eastern Europe was far more polluted than the West, and the people there are far more likely to have been poisoned by toxic dumping. But have we ever heard a condemation of socilism? Capitlism is the freedom to pursue your purpose in life. Powers and others have a problem with this. If you're a luddite, long for the days when there were serfs and nobels, or simply wish to live in a fantasy world where the big evil rich (and inevidably, WASP) ""man"" is out to get you, this book will satisfy your every need."
3,Not up to his best,"When my daughter bought 'The Gold Bug Variations' for me from a remainder table some years ago, I discovered the writing of a master. I've since snarfed up everything of Powers that I could find. I bought 'Gain' as soon as it came out. And, for me, it's the weakest of the lot. It's OK, mind you. And fitfully engaging. But the prose is flaccid, not like the prose/poetry of 'Gold Bug' or 'Three Farmers'. And the view of economics, which motivates the entire book, is hohum. Still, Powers at the top of his game is a force to contend with and I look forward to his next one."
5,belt fits cavalier,"the is correct replacement for ninety seven cavalier, good quality product just like you get at parts counter only there you pay twice as much"
2,Not what I expected,"I use my BH&G; CB as a go to reference, so I was expected the Junior CB to be a cooking primer for my daughter. Instead, many 'recipes' in this book could be summarized with, 'buy a mix/box/kit and follow the directions on the package.' It has a 'homemade' lemonade with the instructions on how to use frozen concentrate. The same with the 'recipe' for mac and cheese. Much of these recipes use processed, prepacked foods and lean towards sweet flavors.My daughter has found some ideas and information that she wants to try."
2,Poorly made,"It is so poorly made and flimsy for the price. Definitely NOT worth the price they are selling it for. Kid will like it, but careful she will fall down pushing this super-light-weight stroller."
5,Very Sturdy,"My 1 year old daughter received this for Christmas this past year. She loved it! Her brother even pushes her around in it, so it can hold a 20 pounder!"
1,"mouse poop, disgusting packaging","I purchased this through amazon and didn't open the package. Wrapped it up for my granddaughter and when it was opened up it was full of mouse poop. Should've taken pictures, should've sent it back but my daughter washed it up and put it in bleach to disinfect it."
2,not worth it,"We bought this with the baby stella doll and I disagree with the other reviewers here. I do not think it's durable. The wheels do not swivel so my 20month old has a hard time pushing it on carpet. She can push it pretty well on the laminate, but the lack of swivel wheels makes a big difference for it's general mobility. Not nearly worth the price. We're returning it."
4,"Great little stroller, seems sturdy","I got this stroller for my granddaughter's second birthday to go with a Baby Stella doll my daughter got her. She likes it a lot, although her stuffed Grinch or Elmo get to ride in it a lot more than Baby Stella does."
5,best bag ever!,"I have a Craftsman's bag and after reading reviews on the DeWalt I opted to try one. I am extremely pleased with it. It holds all my drills, batteries, and all the other ""stuff"" I need. It opens and stays open much better than my Craftsman. I am thinking about buying another one for my saws if I can find someone I don't like enough to give my Craftsmen to. I would recommend the DeWalt to anyone who will listen. It is very sturdy and well built and should last a long time."
5,"Good Quality, Good Price",I've got 5 of these bags to hold all my power equipment. I paid roughly $10 a piece for them and I think the quality is great.
4,Good but not quite great,"Is a good bag, useful pockets and storage. Nice size, holds a drill, impact driver and right angle drill with two 18V batteries plus charger and a number of accessories. Would have given it 5 stars but compared to the Milwaukee one I have, it is built a bit lighter and seems less durable. Overall, however, I would buy it again, especially for the price."
4,Pretty Good Top,"The top is hard to get on, but what soft top isnt?? Once its on, it looks great and keeps the rain out. The instructions are worthless. Bestop must have realized this because the instructions on their website are nothing like the useless, chinese translation junk provided in the box."
3,Old part numbers can differ from new,I needed a left auto ventshade visor on a 2004 ford truck (I broke the old one). I ordered the same number as was on the old vents and the new one with that same number didn't fit too good but I made it work (it was like 3/16 too long - you could tell it was molded with a different mold). It's a good thing I didn't need the right one because it was broken in the package so I just threw it away. The color on the new one is also a little off but it's not very noticeable. Be careful if you're replacing a broken vent visor because the same number may not fit as well. I think if you treat it as a new install you will get the correct fit and the new part number may be different.
3,Worst Ending Ever,"Action packed from beginning to end, only to be dropped like a bag of groceries with a disappointing ending. It was almost as though there were so many pieces of the puzzle left unanswered, that instead of writing a well thought-out ending, Doherty cheesed out and tied it back to one un-likely plot. The first 80% is quality reading, and almost worth the price of admission."
5,Outstanding,"Bersuit makes a mix of rythms and lirics that are quite original and creative. Its music is rock and it is also tropical rythms, some tango, and even a bit of cuarteto and samba. Undoubtedly a band that follows the long lasting Argentinean rock tradition.Additionally, Bersuit does not have problems to bluntly denounce the corruption of Latin American politicians. ""El tiempo no para"" and ""Señor Cobranza"" are master pieces of that attitude. Thanks bersuit, eres lo maximo."
3,Who Produced this?,"Huge McLaughlin fan and there is some fantastic playing on this disc. Foremost is the incredible drumming sequencing between Gary Husband (keyboardist, Wow!) and the actual drummer. For all of that and more this could have been the best DVD he ever put out if it wasn't for the WORST sound I have ever heard on a DVD or CD!Where was the sound engineer? Who recorded this? What were they smoking? The bass is totally distorted and muddy beyond comprehension, at least on my disc. A real shame. I plan to write the manufacturer in desperation.Despite that, I suffered through the awful sound because the performance is otherwise that good. Too bad I can't actually HEAR it clearly much of the time!"
3,Video Quality,"The Music and players are awesome, but the DVD video quality and sound leave a lot to be desired."
5,Travel-Sized Mini Ninja Turtles,"When was the last time your child was bored in the car or sitting in church, and you wished he had something to do? He can't bring along his oversized Elmo doll, or his 12 inch Batman figurine, so you said he couldn't bring anything!Well these 4 mini ninja turtle figurines are perfect for sneaking along in a pocket, or a purse, and they can be easily stored, they're durable, and they can be quickly concealed. They are small and convenient, but they are also extremely detailed. They look as if someone took all 4 original classic ninja turtle figures and shrunk them down. All the detail, less trouble. No pieces or accessories to worry about losing, or having the child swallow.Perfectly made, and very cool."
4,A gift,This was a gift for a child who already had the matching van. Now he can play with the turtles and van.
4,MEMORIES OF CHILDHOD FOR GRANDSON,BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MARINE GRANDSON - HE LOVED THE TURTLES WHEN HE WAS A CHILD! HE NOW HAS A CHILD OF HIS OWN AND PLANS TO SHARE HIS 'TOYS'.
5,DebfromPA,Bought these Mini Turtles for a Co-Worker who works in our local Sewage billing department. Hence the Turtles. She loved them & can display them with pride because they are small enough to be unintrusive.
2,Mini turtles are too Mini,"The turtles I recently purchased are cool, but I don't think they are worth $25. Missing from the product description is the actual size of the figures. They are each about 2"" tall."
5,Great CD!,This is a great cd with all of the spanish christmas classics! Fun to dance and listen to at any holiday party!!!!
1,not a good gift,This was not what we expected. You have to say the password EXACTLY like you did the first time you were setting it up.There is no way a child could do it my 9 year old daughter could not do it. I as an adult couldn't do it either.I packed it away and brought it back.
5,This is cool!,This toy is really cool! You can store secret stuff inside! There is even a secret compartment on the top! 5 stars!
1,I AM ANGRY!!!,"Dear folks - I waited and waited and waited. I thought this Brat thing would be bigger than it is. When I saw that it was small I said, ""I still like it"". But when I heard the sound, it was ugly. I thought it would be good to keep my sister out of my toys. You know what? It wouldn't let me open it!!!! I tried and tried and tried the stupid password. Why did you make it be the toy of the year? It is stupid!!! I didn't even like the ugly sound on the Bratz safe.Don't buy it!(typed by Mom, dictated by Janelle)"
4,Cool..but..,This safe is so cool!Even though the safe that my Mom got me for my birthday the safe door can't open.She's toke it back to get a new one.But it's still fun!
1,"do not waste your time, money or effort","My daughter received the safe for Christmas. After 30 minutes, It ""gliched"" and reset or anything else we tried would not let us give it a password or use the code. Thinking it was just defective we returned it to the store and exchanged. The new one actually lasted about 3 hours before it also messed up. This one took the password fine and the code fine but the knob refused to turn so you could not get in it. I would suggest if you buy this , give them a butter knife to go with it and teach them how to Jimmy the lock because that is the only way they will be able to get in. Don't waste your time, money and effort on this product. P.S. I called the company and they have not heard of this problem. I was told they would research and return my call but I have not received a response."
1,WARNING!!!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR THE PC!!!!! You can't use a joystick, and Activision is no help at all. I wish I could give it zero stars."
1,had a chance,"this game stinks!i can't belive activision would release such garbagethe premise was great,the story was interesting but..... the game play is one of the worst i seendon't waste your hard earned money on this one"
2,Disappointing,"The plot of this game is good. However, the gameplay, in my opinion, is terrible. Compared to GTA: Vice City, this game is pure crap. The vehicle handling is worse than a cartoon and the combat is like an old SNES game. Furthermore, the sound is appalling in that the weapon SFX are weak and unrealistic and the amount of detail is saddeningly non-existent. The environmental detail is the only good point of the game, almost every object in the game is breakable. This game is just a terrible rip-off of Grand Theft Auto 3 and Max Payne."
1,Much better on PS2,I bought this game for my computer at work after having a lot of fun with it on my PS2. Do NOT buy it for computer. The controls totally suck. The PS2 version is 10 times better.
3,Frustration Ensues,"At first this game should be at least somewhat fun to play. If you continue playing you'll start to realize this game is really thin on mechanics and fairness. I don't have the patience to go very far in this game so I can't comment on the plot. Anyway, you'll run into plenty of frustration playing this game. I don't even think Lemmings gave me this much stress! Gunfights? More like firing squads! The chance of you winning a gunfight is small, especially when more than one criminal has a gun. Unlike you, they don't miss. Hand-to-hand combat takes forever. Beating down an old lady shouldn't be so hard. There's no difficulty setting either.Stick with GTA. It's more popular for a reason."
1,absolute trash!!!!!!!!!,what a piece of krap! I thought it was a bargain at $5.99 but it still was a ripoff. Game couldn't even be completed. Get it for free and play it while your waiting for a real game.
2,stinks like Clay,"For the first day or two this humidifier pad work like it should. As soon as the clay was saturated, it made the air in the house smell like clay. When my when my birds would fly, the air was cloudy wih microscopic clay particulars. Ended up putting the pad under a strong stream of water to wash off the clay. Kind of defeats the purpose of the pad."
5,Perfect,It was exactly what I was looking for. Bought it for my husband and it looks perfect on him. Thank you!
5,An excellent resource for both PageMaker and design,"The best part about this book is the extensive introductory section packed with design ideas for different kinds of work. I teach PageMaker classes, and this is always my top recommendation!"
5,"This is an awsome book! If you are an Elvis fan, it is a must read.","Orion is so well written and amazingly close to Elvis Presleys real life story. Elvis fans , you must read it! The author did not know , and was not an Elvis person, or fan. She is not a phychic either, but her predictions were right on! I love this book!! She also wrote Is Elvis Alive? I read this book also. Great book!!!!"
5,"Really, really good recipes","Simple and fancy, this book has recipes that cover it all. Have fun deciding which one you'll fix today. The ones that I've tried freeze well."
3,Lacking in Theory,"I found that these books were full of step by step explanations of how to do things, but lacked in depth explanations of why you would do the things and what they meant. I have not tried the Sybex Core pack, but the Sybex SQL Server 70-229 did a much better job of getting at the theory and not just the semantics of how to do things step by step."
2,Poor,"I've now completed 70-210, 70-215, 70-216 and 70-217 (I'm also MCSE NT).Unfortunately, the 70-217 book was almost poor to an extreme, though the others weren't so bad. A number of topics quizzed in the exam were simply not covered in the book.Hands-on experience is always a good idea. However, with these books in hand, it's absolutely essential."
