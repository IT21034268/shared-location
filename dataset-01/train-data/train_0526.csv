1,Can't read the Clock!,"If you are buying this for an alarm clock, not being able to read the time may be a problem."
5,Really good sound quality,"I really love it.I hate thinkpad's v~o~i~c~e, while with them, everythink is perfact.while there's still some lack of bass, thinking of its price. just perfact."
4,JBL Duet Speaker System for Portable Music and PC - White (Pair),"Very fast shipping, the speakers sound very good for thier size, will work very good on my tool box at work."
2,The fail,"PROs:1. Low price2. Small footprintCONs:1. Sound Quality - you get what you pay for in sound quality. Previously I used a set of Klipsh 2.0 computer speakers that blew the socks off of these speakers in sound quality (and just about every other feature).2. Clipping - at medium-high levels these speakers clip3. Volume Knob/On-Off Knob - This knob is shiny and smooth, making it difficult to grab, it is fairly hard to turn as well - which is not a good combination. I'm 31 and like to exercise (I'm not weak) and it is annoying to me that I need to use to hands to turn these one - one to hold the entire speaker so I can get some leverage, the other to turn the knob - thats ridiculous.Kids under 10, or folks over 60 would probably not be able to get these speakers on very easily.4. Not available in Black______________________________That said, this price range is fairly bottom of the barrel and these might just do the trick for you."
3,ehhhh,"After reading all these other reviews I was convinced - these were the speakers for me - the reviews made them sound amazing. I just plugged them in and...ehhh. They're OK - much better for acoustic/guitar stuff, the bass is seriously lacking so it doesn't have that ""full"" sound I was hoping to get. If I put some rap on it sounds only slightly better than my stupid laptop build-in speakers. If your collection consists mostly of classical or acoustic stuff with no bass - great, these are for you (especially classical sounds good). If not...well, you get the idea."
4,Just what I wanted,"I ordered these speakers because I wanted some portable speakers that needed no receiver/amp to play adequately music from my MP3 player. I use them when on my treadmill and I haul them out to the back deck for cookouts. They won't replace your family room sound system for permanent play but for what I believe is their intended purpose, they are great."
2,Vulnerable to cellphone interference,"I bought these because they are white and match well with a Mac desktop. However I too had buzz problems but not as others described. I can't put my AT&T GSM/GPRS/Edge and 3G phones in the same room. This is no good because I want to make and receive calls while using the Mac. I had a charging station 8 feet from the computer and still had problems. Shame on JBL for not designing a shield in the speaker circuit. They sound good and look nice, but I sent them back for a refund."
1,Annoying shut-off,"great sound, but they automatically shut off when they don't hear sound; so, ok for music but useless for computer communication, instant messaging, VOIP...shame on JBL! Don't buy"
3,Price should be cheaper,"I figured given these are made by JBL they'd have absolutely perfect sound. Well, the bass isn't as great as some reviewers on the site I purchased it from had said. Also, the on/off/volume control knob isn't as easy to turn as one would think. I had trouble for a while doing it one-handed without holding the top of it down. The phrase ""You get what you pay for"" doesn't quite apply to this - the price should be much lower.Unless the speakers I received have some manufacturer defects, I would recommend looking into a different set of speakers."
1,"JBL should be ashamed to brand these ""speakers""","In my life I have owned speakers and headphones of all levels of expense and quality. These were the worst. For this price, one is simply paying for the JBL brand name and the weird non-functional design. I actually paid $50 for a pair of these back in 2005 from the Apple ""store,"" and the horribly traumatic experience of having to listen to anything eminating from them has basically scarred me for life."
1,No Product,"I`d write a product review if I had a product to review. Maybe you can help with that ? This item was ordered THREE weeks ago, please I`m in silence till they get here."
3,"Quality sound, but too weak for the price","Only complaint is the weak bass, which I expected since these are so small. In hindsight, I should have spent a little more for a 2.1 system."
3,Well I thought more money meant better product,"I own other JBL products and I'm quite pleased with them, however I've noticed that I always have to get a replacement due to dents or defects with JBL's product - these speakers are no exception. I purchased a cheap-y pair of speakers at radio shack some 2 years ago, and the wiring started to go on them. The sound would only come out of one speaker unless you fiddle around with the cord. O.K. time to replace the cheap-y's and upgrade to the slightly more JBL's. Well, I go to play them and guess what? Sound comes out of one speaker only. I tried several different outputs, different computers, directly from my iphone, yet sound only comes out of one speaker. I want to keep them so I've requested a like for like replacement, but it's unfortunate that JBL sticks to their standard protocol - to make every other item they manufacture faulty in some respect. Great product, but too bad for the lack on consistent quality."
2,Works. But poor sound quality.,"I am a bit of an audiophile and have had tons of different home, car and theater speakers over the past 10 years. This pair was not meant to be anything special. It was only meant for occasional use with my laptop (which has an X-fi soundcard and sounded fine with my old speakers).Unfortunately, the speakers sound awful. I would be upset if I paid 10 dollars. There is no depth to the sound and I have heard better sound quality from speakers that come free bundled with desktops. I wish I wasn't too lazy to return them, but alas, I am."
5,And WOW Again and Again,Never hesitate to buy JBL no matter whatever is the price. The price of these speakers are lower than the headphone and I was not expecting such a nice quality of sound from 28 dollars speakers but after I pluged it to my HP DV7 I was amazed of such a high quality sound for 28 dollars. In year 2003 I heard the sound of these speaker which came with a compaq desktop computer since then I decided if i would want speakers in future I will only buy JBL. Creative sound card and JBL speakers = Super Quality Sound. Both companies are the doctors of sound making devices.
4,Amazing Sound!,I read reviews here and elsewhere and decided on JBL Duet Speakers for my iMac. I could not be more pleased. Clear full sound. I have experienced no buzz as mentioned in some reviews. Highly recommend. I was willing to pay several hundred dollars for a good sound. This system cost me $38.00
5,Great Sound,"As a professional composer, I have to admit I was surprised at the clarity of these speakers. For the price, this is a great buy."
4,Good speakers for the price,"I've owned many many speakers over the years. Small speakers like the Duets can easily be hit or miss. Obviously with a name like JBL, you would expect that they are more ""hit"" than ""miss"", and this is true. These speakers are crisp and provide a reasonable amount of lower-end response considering their size.My two biggest complaints: Lack of a headphone jack on the front (which isn't a problem for me with a laptop, but on a desktop machine it could be an annoyance). The speakers aren't labeled right and left (and even the instructions aren't labeled). The ONLY way to figure verify that you have the correct setup is to plug them in and use the attached device to test (it happens that they follow the ""standard"" of volume control on the right speaker). Neither are deal breakers, but certainly would have made these speakers worth ""5 stars""."
2,I have grown to hate these speakers,"Right out of the box they didn't really work - or they worked intermittently. Use case: I leave these speakers plugged in to my laptop when I am sitting at my desk. I use Pandora, Spotify, and Amazon MP3 to play music. Most of the time I get sound out of them for about 2 minutes and then mysteriously there will be no sound - the green ""on"" button will be lit but no music. After a period of no sound, green light on, the green light will go off and, sometimes, they will magically restart.The JBL website has some troubleshooting tips and that seems to make them work for a while, but then I'll be back to on for two minutes, then off completely.Although I bought these a couple of months ago, I will probably return them unless someone can point me in the direction of how to fix permanently.On the plus side, it's hard to believe that such great sound comes out of such a small package."
1,Energy saving feature ruins the experience,"I like the sound from these speakers - but they keep turning off in the middle of some of my music that features quiet passages. It is very frustrating because the speakers will not stay on during some of the music I want to play for meditation. I would not buy these again, even though the sound is good and they fit great on my desk top, because speakers that won't stay on are a problem."
1,Broke after being used twice,"It must be an unqualified manufactuer like other small electronics sold on Amazon. The first time works, and then didn't use it for a long time, four months or so. The second time we did use it again, the sound suddenly disapeared in the middle of the movie, I turned it off and on again, the sound resumed with no problem through the rest of the movie. The third and fourth time, this happened more and more frequently, now I'm sitting in front of my computer watching a movie, the sound can only last two or three minutes. And I cannot return it now. It's not a cheap item, so save yourself some time and money. Like many other examples, this is definitely something you buy in a store but not Amazon. There is a reason why it doesn't get five stars."
1,Delayed Sound,Sound does not start immediately. It takes 5 -30 seconds. This energy saving feature is horrible. I going to other speakers.
1,WORST AMAZON PURCHASE,"I purchased these to use with my computer. As soon as they plug in to the computer they simply buzz and the sound increases as you turn the volume up. This is not a subtle buzz, it is very loud. It is impossible to use these speakers. Unfortunatley, I threw the box away as was unable to return them. I absolutely HATE these speaker and they are complete garbage. I just wanted something simple and inexpensive, but they do not function at all. DO NOT BUY THEM."
3,"Great for treble, poor for bass, made out of plastic (not aluminum)","My original review of this product was rather different. The only thing remaining the same was the chassis build, which is misleading. (plastic with aluminum-gray paint. Not aluminum metal. Make 'em cheap and build up the landfill, hot diggity!)Trebles are really well-reproduced. Midtones are fair, but bass is virtually nonexistent. (60-20000Hz frequency range.) This is a good set for apartment-dwellers but if you want deep throbbing bass goodness, you won't find it here.Longevity is another issue. Mine started developing a slight buzzing noise. I didn't like it. I mean, some people might like the buzz, but I really don't. I don't even like the buzz that comes from drinking booze.At $30 or less, these would make a great value. But they aren't quite the greatest speakers to hit the market..."
4,Great Sound for an affordable price,"I have been very pleased with the overall quality of my JBL speakers. The deliver clean audio and surprising sound from such a small foot print. The only complaint I would have would be that they are so light in weight, that I have to hold the speaker with the volume control to keep it from moving when adjusting the volume control. Maybe adding a larger non-skid matting on the bottom of the speaker would help keep them in one place. Over all I give them a 4 out of 5. Good job JBL !"
5,"Good value, manageable size","This is the second pair we have purchased, and I believe they are a great value for the size. The sound is not top of the line, but it is pretty darn good, especially for $40 speakers. Way better than any built in speakers and they make movies and music much more desirable. I also take them on trips and use them with an ipod frequently and they sound great."
2,Avg quality (below expectations) & buzzing sound,"See a lot of other reviews about buzzing sound - this is terrible. In addition, I'd like to mention that there's nothing fancy about sound quality - it's normal, which is below my expectation for the price (I'd expect quality to be noticeably above average). Buy $5-10 speakers on ebay and get similar result with no buzz.I'll try to check if manufacturer will accept a return."
3,Passable...I guess,"These things are about 7.5"" tall. They are...well, speakers have long been a subjective thing, but they're tolerable looking if not really my taste. I like beige, all right? The speakers are so small and light that they are easy to push around accidentally.That brings me to one of the major problems. The power knob is really small and slippery, so you will probably push the speaker around just to get enough traction to turn it on.Both speakers have L.E.Ds., in different locations. Really excessive and distracting.Sound quality - mediocre. I don't care about bass, and I think in the right situation (not being exposed to better sound) you could get used to the sound quality, but I am disappointed after reading all of the entusiastic reviews and spending all the money. I just needed some speakers, though, and I don't want weird ass 5.1 black speakers I can't mount...so my options were limited.I suggest you keep looking."
1,Cheap product!,Bought these speakers to use on my boat with my sirius radio barely used and within six months one speaker completely blown and amazon won't take back!Thanks Amazon!!
1,buy someting else,"when they worked the sound was good,not great- maybe 3.5 stars. But one speaker basically became inaudible after about 6 months, and now they are less than half as good. The Logitech speakers, which are cheaper and have a subwoofer, are dramatically better , even when the JBL's work properly."
3,Great bass but otherwise nothing special,"Bought these speakers to give my laptop sound a little more oomph. The bass on them sounds great for listening to music, but they do have a tendency to give you some background buzzing. I think the other reviews overrate them, and suggest you shop around before buying."
3,Great speakers with an annoying habit,"These are great speakers for the price and this is the second pair I bought. One of the old ones stopped working several years after I bought them. But that's not the problem. The new ones have a feature that shuts them off every time there is no sound running through them. Unfortunately, that also includes low sound and message alarms and a delay turning back on whenever they do ""hear"" something. They didn't come with a manual, but I assume this is some sort of energy saving feature. Not cool.JBL Duet Speaker System for Portable Music and PC - White (Pair)"
2,They broke after a week,"These speakers had fine sound quality - almost as good as the internal speakers that came with my Mac desktop computer anyway. I bought them because I needed something louder than the internal speakers, and they were a little louder, but not much. Then, about a week after I bought them, they stopped working. There was a soft ""pop"" and then no more sound ever. The best thing I have to say was just the Amazon was great about refunding me my money and making it easy to ship them back."
3,"Very fast delivery, but I suspect this item was used.","This item shipped very fast. And it works fine. However, I noticed a good amount of scratches on this item, which makes me suspect that it may have been used. The scratches were on the back, so they don't bother me because you cannot see them. I would just beware. Although I was not 100% happy with the item, It wasn't worth it to send them back."
1,buzzing noise and broke after two weeks,"A faint buzzing noise was present which was especially noticible when speakers were ON while no audio signal from my computer was being sent to the speakers.After two weeks of minimal use, the speakers didn't even turn on.I think I must have gotten a bum pair, as the other reviews are good.The speakers are stylish, but I couldn't judge the sound quality because of the buzzing or vibration noise."
1,"Ralph Nader would labeled these ""unsafe at any speed"".","Do not buy these speakers at any price. Don't even bother accepting them as a gift. You will be disappointed. OK they sound alright until you turn up the volume, then they feedback regardless of how they are positioned. It must be an internal design flaw because I have seen two sets of these now and they both do the same thing regardless of weather they are connected to a laptop or not. Also, the volume control is tapered and too smooth to get a hold of so you will be frustrated when you try to turn it just to find your fingers slipping around a stationary control knob. I almost threw them across the room. Other than that they are great."
1,most frustrating product ever,"The SOUND of these speakers is very nice - really, they are terrific (especially for a desktop product) But they apparently have some strange ""power-saving"" feature whereby they turn themselves off (after what I can only determine as a random amount of time) or perhaps it's dependent on the strength of the sound signal going to them - I don't know, and who knows what it actually takes to turn them on!!? 8 to 10 seconds in to a song they MAY come on - they might wait longer. And if they song gets too quiet (think classical music) they will just turn off! Do they think the music is over? I really don't get it - and there didn't seem to be any way to override this setting.REALLY ANNOYING. Mine were hooked to a Mac-mini - If you can get them to work though, the sound is great."
1,On/Off knob is pathetic,"I have these on my 18"" Toshiba TV and I like to turn them off at night because the on-light is too bright. However, the knob requires a pair of pliers to operate. Otherwise, I think they are excellent quality speakers."
1,Amazingly Terrible!!,"These looked amazingly good for the price... the apple store was even carrying them, and they don't carry garbage.Well, I got them, plugged them in, and they were ok for system beeps and such. But put music on and MASSIVE DISTORTION.An absolutely terrible product!"
4,"Great Speakers, Good Price, But Nothing Too Special","These speakers are great for the price. Don't expect too much out of them though. I think it's a little overhyped on amazon.com. I would definitely suggest these speakers to buyers who are looking for quality speakers with a good sound on a budget, and who doesn't care about having Excellent sounding speakers. The bass isn't that great either on these speakers. hope this helps. Oh, and the nob is hard to turn. I have to use two hands to turn the them off; one hand to keep the speakers stable. Oh, and there is an occasionally static sound, it happens quite frequently when you start using them but lessens as you use them more. And the speaker with the nob gets really hot sometimes but nothing to serious i think. They're good speakers though."
3,Nice Sound,These speakers are quite a good bargain for the price. They would be perfect if the linking cable was a bit longer and if the power/volume button was a different design. The conical button is very difficult to grasp and turn without picking up the speaker.
4,Almost Perfect,"These cool JBL speakers are by far the best sound I have heard from small and relatively cheap speakers. Ideal for computer and iPod they provide a good overall sound, as long as you don't expect too much bass. They also happen to look very nice, sleek and modern.I rate these 4.5 stars out of 5, and would give them 5 stars if the on/of/volume knob would be less slippery and easier to grip.No need to look any further; for this kind of price these are (almost) perfect!"
3,they make sound.,"I'm not really sure what people are raving about. They work OK, but they still sound like PC speakers. That is, they do not give a full sound. They are probably better than whatever speakers came with your computer, but not by much. There is no comparison to the full sound that you get from even a modest (bookshelf) stereo system. My advice: If you just want speakers that make sound, these are fine. If you want to hear beautiful music, buy a better PC speaker system like the Harmon-Kardon Soundsticks II. Better yet, spend $10-$25 on a mini-to-RCA cable and connect your computer audio output to the auxiliary input on your stereo system. If you have your stereo in the same room as the computer, that will be your best bet for great sound (IMHO). But what do I know...."
3,"Great sound, loud buzz","If you have to run the power cable next to other power cables, which you likely will, you may find that you get a loud buzz when there is no music playing. I believe this is due to improper or inadequate shielding of the power cable.When the speakers are playing audio, the sound is great, but when they're not, the buzz is fairly nerve-wracking.So, if your speakers can be wired away from other computer cables, these are good speakers. But if you need to run the power cable near the other cables, you may get a buzzing sound."
2,"nice, if you can stand the buzz","For the size and power level, these speakers sound quite nice. But it seems as though they are not properly shielded. They produce a constant soft 60 Hz buzz that is rather annoying in a quiet environment. When my new speakers arrived I thought they were defective and exchanged them for another pair. But alas, the defect seems to be in design rather than manufacture since the replacement pair buzzes as well. If I were in an environment with some ambient noise, like an office, I might not be bothered. But in my quiet home study the buzz is quite irritating."
4,Great sound in a small package,"Just got these speakers today, and I have them hooked up to my Droid for streaming Pandora and stored music from my personal library. These are great little speakers with unreal range! I'm able to turn these speakers up enough to hear every detail without disturbing any neighbors/co-workers, granted our office has sound masking and noise canceling, but what sounds loud to me can't even be heard from 6 feet away in our office setting. I love the bass that these speakers can produce, they sound like they should be 2 or 3 times larger than they are. I wouldn't categorize these as a portable speaker, but more of a small desk top speaker. They measure about 3.5 by 7.5 inches and the connection cables are about 6' long. For the price it would be very hard to beat these speakers. Worth every penny."
2,Got progressively worse with time.,"I got these in 2008 and was pleased with the sound quality (with the exception of the slight buzz when the speakers are on but no audio is playing--as some reviewers have also mentioned). Then, gradually, something happened with the bass...instead of hearing the bass, you'd hear a grainy, booming buzz and not much else. This problem got so bad in recent times, that now the speakers are completely unusable. I don't think I would buy them again; they seem fine at first but it takes some time for the flaws to come out."
3,"Good hardware, bad wires","I've owned these speakers for 4 months now and let me tell you my experience. The hardware is pretty good. The sounds get quite loud for their size. Also they look pretty nice. However the problem is with the wiring. They really skimped on the wires. I don't move my speakers at all but after a few months, the contact inside the wire started to give way. So I would have to jiggle the wire to reconnect the speakers. Now after couple jiggling sessions, I have the entire wire twisted to get back the sound. So for that aspect, I have to say it is very disappointing as the actual cone of the speakers are good. But without the wires, it's really pretty useless. So overall I regret this purchase. I am looking for new speakers to buy."
2,Disappointed!,"Let me start by saying that I'm a definite loyalist to JBL and their quality speakers they make on all levels. After reading all the reviews on these, I bought them. The first thing that kind of irritated me- not sure why- but did, was that the quiet turn on is annoyingly long. When I listen to voicemails at work on these, I have to start the messages, wait for the speakers to turn on 1/2 way through, then rewind and start over to hear it all. Maybe I just got a bad set. The left-main speaker has also pretty much died, and no I don't crank these too far.Again, maybe I just got a bad set, but my old set of Harmon Kardon's sounded better, were more reliable, and worked immediately. I'll be purchasing something else next time for sure.Seems like everyone else loves them though. So take my review however you want. I just expected more from JBL, even if they are a cheaper set."
4,Nice speakers,"These speakers sound great. I'm using them for my desktop PC, and when I travel, for my laptop. The only drawback is the power/volume switch, which is a little hard to turn on."
3,"Decent enough, but not sure they're worth the premium","Based on user comments, I figured I'd buy slightly more expensive speakers for the office than I'd intended. Unlike many of the other reviewers though, after listening to them, I didn't think these speakers significantly outperformed other speakers in the $20-30 range. They're fine enough, but I think you definitely pay a premium for the styling. Bass is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from low end speakers, nor do they particularly fill a medium sized room. But hey, they look good and they're still reasonably inexpensive."
5,Great Sound!,"I was looking for some speakers to hook up to my laptop for my dorm room. I'm pretty picky about sound, and the laptop speakers just don't cut it for me (or almost anyone). After looking at tons of reviews (and not just on Amazon), the JBL Duet Speakers seemed to be the best value for their price. I just got them, and I'm definitely not disappointed. For such small speakers, I'm amazed at the awesome sound they produce. I would recommend these to anyone looking for high quality, affordable speakers for use in smaller rooms, such as a bedroom or office."
5,good looking speakers,i bought these speakers in silver clor. already had owned a pair in black. silver color much sharper. sound is great for the money. love the speakers. would highly recommend them.
2,No Right Speaker / Left Speaker Markers!,"The speakers are OK and sound fine, but, insanely, there is no marking to let you know which is the right-side speaker and which is the left."
3,Decent,"These speakers are decent for what they are, but they can't match the sound of a set with a subwoofer."
2,pops and crackles,"Despite all the wonderful reviews, my speakers keep having trouble with crackles and pops and dropped notes in songs. Maybe it just doesn't like playing iTunes from my laptop."
5,BAMF little speakers,"I got these four or five years ago, and they're going strong as ever. The sound was strong and clear then, and it still is now, after using them in place of tv speakers for a good year and half, and at least 10 hours of music a week otherwise, and a good few months living in the humid bathroom. Never had any problems, even with as many times as I've knocked them over or accidentally pulled the cord. My sister almost stole them when I moved. If these died tomorrow (which I doubt), I'd buy another pair in a heartbeat.Depending on your musical taste, you can easily annoy your family members with these bad boys. Phenomenal range and power for their size.Only complaint would be that the volume knob can be hard to turn off (not adjust up and down, adjusting is fine, just to turn off). Sometimes I use my teeth, ngl."
4,Great speakers for your computer,"I purchased these speakers for my son. He wanted some speakers for his computer. He is very happy with them, they sound good and take up little space."
5,Nice speakers,"Nice good-looking speakers, excellent sound. Not very well shielded (some cell phones might cause interference)."
4,works fine!,"These speakers work fine. I don't hear any hissing and the sound is fine. I use them in my office with three others surrounded by computers, telephones and other electronics and no distortion. good purchase and I would recommend."
2,They broke in about a year.,These speakers stopped working after a year. It seems like they should have lasted longer than that. There are better sounding systems with sub-woofers available for the same amount of money.
5,Awesome speakers,"After reading the reviews, I decided to purchase these speakers. I was blown away at the sound quality. You cannot beat this quality for the price. I have them hooked up to my HD TV for surround sound and they sound great."
5,"Big sound, small price, and nice looking too.","These are attractive, compact, silver-colored speakers that can complement your brushed aluminum computer, like the Mac. They are very reasonably priced and, more importantly, they sound great! They don't have a bulky subwoofer to take up space. This is a great buy."
3,Meh,"I'm not a big Amazon review writer, but I just had to come on here and set things straight. These speakers are just not that great. They are slightly better than ""standard"" computer speakers, sure, but not by much. I wanted something with a big sound - these things become distorted (especially the bass) at medium volumes. If you listen to heavy rock or bass-heavy r&b;, you better plan to listen quietly.These speakers are not a bad deal for the price, but I think they have been hyped up way too much in the reviews here."
2,Annoying buzzing sound!,I had bought a different brand of similarly priced speakers before and was perfectly happy with them until they broke. These speakers have an annoying buzzing sound that will not go away. If anyone knows how to get rid of this sound please help me! If not for the buzzing sound they would be just fine.
1,Unreliable,Do not buy. It worked fine the first two weeks. Then it stopped. The power save mode kills this product. I would avoid any JBL product that uses this feature.
1,"Good Speakers, Aluminum Issues","I was given a pair of the white speakers as a gift and absolutely loved them. Then unfortunately one day my roommate tripped over the chord and shattered the internal components so i ordered the aluminum ones in order to continue to listen to music. They have been nothing but trouble. First pair, they sent me and they didn't work even straight out of the box. I was given a prompt exchange. They worked for about 2 months. Then the left speakers (the one that actually receives feed from the computer directly) no longer produces any sound. Maybe its an issue of the aluminum ones being different. But I was highly disappointed"
1,Volume knob broke in a few months!!!,"They look great and the sounds isn't bad when the volume controls worked. Unfortunately now, the volume knob doesn't work anymore and I can only get sound if I push on the knob REALLY hard. The worst thing is that it won't incrementally increase or decrease the volume, it is either off or on EXTREMLY loud. I recommend getting something that is rated a little better! Keep doing your research before you buy."
1,"Sound fine, annoying buzz, volume knob difficult to turn","So for $50 speakers, what do you expect. Plug them in and they play sound. Kind of hard to mess that up, right? My gripes are twofold, however:1) The volume knob is the ONLY thing on the speaker that you ever need to touch, and yet they've made it incredibly difficult to turn. It's tiny, slippery, and basically requires two hands to turn (one to hold the speaker and the other to grip the knob *really* hard and turn). Maybe I just got a bad pair, but you'd think they would make that ONE single thing easy to use.2) There's definitely a buzz coming from the speakers. I can hear it right now. It's not loud, but loud enough to hear in a quiet room. bzzzzzz....They seem minor, but I find both of those problems to be increasingly annoying. In fact, after a few months of using these speakers, I think I want to replace them. I'm surprised that others liked them so much."
2,JBL Duets,Attractive and easy to install. I expected at least some base from the speakers. With no low end they sound very tinny. All and all I am dissappointed with the product and would not recommend it.
2,New Bass Technology? What Bass?,"I was reading all the good reviews thinking these would be a good all around speakers. I like the idea of 2 speakers with no subwoofer. I don't know where these people get their speakers but mine from this site has no bass at all! I tried all the setting I can find on Windows 7, and all the mixers that came with all the application. There is just no bass out of them!! For this price point there are much better ones out there."
2,stopped working less than 6 months after purchase,decent sound and good volume but broke within 6 months. Volume control stopped working so sound could not be adjusted except to extremely high level.
3,"Nothing special, barely average.","All the great reviews here had me hoping for something that was at least better than its peers in its price range. Nope. They perform just like other $30 speakers. The clarity the folks speak of simply isn't there; these sound just like cheap full-range PC speakers except they have slightly better-than-average treble extension. There is very little bass extension, even less than I expected from a small full-range speaker.Overall, I'm not unhappy with these speakers, but they are surely nothing special either."
3,JBL Duel Speakers,"After reading the reviews I expected better sound quality. Overall, OK for the money. If you are expecting rich, full sound reproduction, I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Awesome - but realize what they're for,"I bought these speakers when I left for college, and they were the perfect size to fit on a desk, fill the room with music when I'm working out, etc. The sound quality is great, and its easy to set-up, and as important, disable: just plug them into and out of the headphone jack.However, if you want to throw a loud party, get something bigger: After having them on full blast a few times, they started to get a static-sound at high volume (fine when lower though)Still, I don't think there's anything better out there. I'd buy again."
4,"JBL duet speakers, great speakers for price","These speakers provide better sound than built-in speakers, just be sure you have a decent sound card, since that is sometimes the difference between good/bad sound. These speakers don't provide much punch, but for the money they provide decent sound quality. I purchased these for my mom, who kept complaining about the sound of her Toshiba laptop speakers. These have helped her enjoy much better sound for You-Tubes and other audio bites/recordings on her computer."
3,Great sounding,I bought these speakers to replace the Harmon Kardon speakers that I had previously used with my PC. They sound fine for everyday listening but I was disappointed that they lacked two key features that my previous speakers had (No tone control and no headphone input.) But that was my fault for not checking more thoroughly before I bought. Still they are good quality sounding speakers and they were not expensive.
4,I like it,I buoght it in Dec. 2008. It looks good and work veruy good. It is the right size for my laptop. The sound is great.
3,"Good Speakers, but the A/C adapter will likely fail","The speakers worked great for their cost and size, but after about a year the A/C adapter started shorting out. Maybe if you keep them stationary then it won't be so much of a problem, but if you move them around alot the wire on the A/C adapter wears easily."
2,If you've ever heard half-decent speakers stay away from these,"Bottom line, the sound is so bad my wife told me to return them. They sound like the free speakers included with a PC.I bought these based on the reviews here, but unfortunately they sounds awful. They aren't good for the price, which is very high for the quality.It isn't the lack of bass, I expected that. I wasn't expecting these to sound as good as my big JBL speakers (L100T). I was expected them to have undistorted sound, and to be better than an intercom.I ended up spending $100 on better speakers, not wanting to get sucked into a succession of not-good-enoughs"
2,Never worked all the way; Broke soon after purchase,"I bought a pair of these at the local bricks 'n mortar MacMall. They never worked right. The extended speaker never gave the volume of the main speaker, and eventually the main speaker sound cut out completely. This was after a month of use. Complete trash."
4,Great computer speakers for normal use,"If you are just looking for some good speakers to listen to music, you tube videos or casual gaming these are great. I'm sure they don't compete with the ones twice as much but you get what you pay for. Remember that."
2,Speaker stopped working,"I've had the speakers for less than a month and one of the speakers just stopped working. I believe that the volume was always at a reasonable level, so I don't understand why the speaker doesn't work anymore. Highly disappointed."
4,Computer Speakers,"I chose these because they had been well reviewed. Maybe because I have old ears, but I couldn't hear the base very well. That is a disappointment. Everything else is great. Clarity is fine."
3,JBL Duets vs Altec Lansing VS260: Good for cheap speakers,"I compared the JBL Duets to similarly priced Altec Lansing VS2620 speakers. Neither have subwoofers so the bass was limited but not unexpectedly so. Why no sub? Generally speaking, they take up to much space and I find them to be boomy and overwhelming. My main criteria for speakers like this is decent clarity in the mid range and a generally non-fatiguing listen experience. I mainly use these to listen to music streams which are pretty low res to begin with.Neither speaker was ""audiophile"" quality by a long shot though both had okay sound quality fo the money. I'd give a slight nod to the Altec's which have a bigger sound, more stereo separation, and a generally ""nicer"" sound.Conclusion: both are better than the teeny speakers on my MacBook Pro 13"" and okay for casual listening. I will be stepping up eventually to the M-Audio A40, the AudioEngine A2, or, if I get really ambitious, the very pricey offerings from B&W; and Focal."
2,Reasonable sound,"These speakers have reasonable sound. The speakers are more than the average. however they are very light-weight and, the volume control is hard to turn in proportion to the weight of the speaker. You will have to hold down the speaker in order to turn up the volume."
3,"Good sound, awful buzzing","I tried to use these with my laptop (Dell Inspiron 1720) but couldn't get rid of the buzzing noise others have mentioned, no matter how far I moved them from the computer or where I plugged them in. I took them to a different room and tested them with my mp3 player, where they worked fine and sounded pretty good. So -- before ordering, consider what you will use them for."
2,Lego wannabe,"My son received this toy at age 4. Playmobil toys look cool, but they really are junk. They have lego style action figures that cannot stand by themselves, it would be easier to balance a chopstick on its end then have one of these caracters stand up. At least lego guys have peg holes in their feet and can stand eadily.Playmobils get demolished by kids, they take them apart and lose all the little pieces in less then a week, so they toy is useless or looks like a scrap yard shell. I would rather buy legos for my kids because they can demolish the original set, but at least play with the parts and make their own new toys with the set parts."
5,As good as wine,"Since 1980, when I was only 16, I have not read a book as fantastic as this one. Its pages are so dense you may even spend hours through one single paragraph in order to feel all images created by the author and taste all its delicate and, at the same time, intricate constructions. A book I will never forget."
4,From This Day Forward,"Camille Winthrop has had enough. Her mother is reduced to setting her up with men from the produce aisle in the supermarket, and Camille can't take it anymore. She answers an ad looking for a woman to decorate offices in a town of eighty bachelors. It's Camille's dream job in a dream town full of hunky blondes. Wade Harrison is the one who placed the ad. He's tired of seeing his town lose out to the big city year after year as the young people move away. Wade isn't worried about the national attention, but he is afraid of making a commitment to another woman after having been hurt. The road to true love is never smooth, and for city girl Camille and hometown Wade, there are some rough patches, but eventually Camille convinces Wade that she's in it for the long haul. Elise Ewing brings off a cute premise in From This Day Forward. Romantic and humorous."
2,"The Book's Just Like the Car, Unfulfilled Potential","Perhaps I was expecting too much from this book but then again perhaps it was written for Corvette fans unfamiliar with the GTP car and the IMSA series. It's really nothing more than a picture book that spends as much time discussing the Corvette's competition in the IMSA series as it does the Corvette itself. I was expecting much deeper insight into the technical aspects of the car including design, development, construction, and lot more information about the engines. I also expected a lot more technical pictures of the car's construction and components. It's unfortunate the author only scratched the surface of such an interesting GTP car. I'll give the book a D+ at best."
5,"Spine-tingling, creepy, worth every page turning minute!","A wonderful read for those who enjoy a mystery woven together with supernatural happenings. If you're interested in quilting, the occult, or just a grabber of a book, go for it! Best read with the lights on, and a big dog nearby"
1,What Happened to the Characters?,"Since I loved Ammie, Come Home and Shattered Silk when I was younger, I bought those two and this 'sequel' for my Kindle. I vaguely remember reading this one when I was younger, but I couldn't even finish it this time. First of all, who WERE these characters? Secondly, Why was Karen's name changed to Kara ? (That annoyed me more than her complete turnaround regarding her characterisation - she turned into the people she seemed to loathe!). Seriously, the name change of the character bugged me so badly I had to put the book aside. It just made me nuts. Normally, I'm a huge Barbara Michaels fan, and I really really wanted to love this book too. Alas, not meant to be."
4,Does a quilter sew her thoughts and emotions into each quilt?,"I didn't know this book was part of a series, but that didn't matter; it read fine as a stand alone novel. Rachel is a graduate student in womens' crafts. She has a part-time job in a vintage clothing store in the front room of a family's house. A bag of quilts mysteriously is left outside the door. One of the quilts is cursed and the curse affects Rachel. Interesting story as Rachel's new friends try desperately to break the curse."
2,"Good Premise, Unlikable Characters","Was Barbara Michaels feeling ticked off while she churned out this one? I can't believe how nasty Kara (Karen from Shattered Silk) turned out. She's just plain rhymes-with-rich in this book; such behavior is NOT the same thing as being assertive, Ms. Michaels. The heroine (Rachel? Was that her name?) is a total nonentity, as others have mentioned....until the end, when suddenly she had all the answers. (Where'd she get them?) The hero (can't remember his name and don't care) was utterly unappealing. People seemed to do a lot of slapping and snapping at each other. I got fed up. But I did think it was a clever premise, so I flipped pages just to get the story and let the characters go on bickering without me."
3,"Good, but not great","I feel the best thing about this book was how the author was able to spark my interest in quilts and vintage clothing--two things I have never given much, if any, thought. I will now look at quilts with much more appreciation for detail and skill. As far as the story goes, I liked the characters of Rachel (the sympathetic heroine) and Adam (comic relief). While the story held my interest fairly well, I found I could easily set it aside at times. The ending was wrapped up very nicely. Overall, a good book, but not a great one."
3,Stitches in Time,"I thought the book was comfusing and at times boring. The summary of it sounded very exuberant and interesting because i love mysteries. But when i started (1rst chapter) it was so hard to get into it. It then got better later, and became interesting but it wasn't a very good book to keep (UNDER LOCK AND KEY!)But dont take my opinion because you really have to expearance it yourself. For the reason also may be the fact iam 14."
3,Not one of her best.,"Not one of her best stories. Most of the supporting characters were interesting; they had such vivid personalities and some life to them. Not our heroine though; she was such a nonentity. I couldn't understand why the others took such an interest in her. The worst part of the book though, was the long-awaited climax. What a disappointment. It was so flat. Such a lame ending. I did learn a lot about quilts though."
3,Not as good as others by Michaels,"I have been a big fan of Barbara Michaels for years now, and I always snap up her books whenever I come across them. Sadly, I hate to admit that this was not one of her better books. Granted, I enjoyed reading it - and I did read it from beginning to end; however, this one wasn't as believable as many of her other books. Yes, I realize that this book, like most of her books, deals with the supernatural and as such, the reader must suspend disbelief somewhat. However, the characters in this book were all far too quick to accept what was going on. What normal person says (esentially), ""Oh, you're trying to kill me. You must be possessed.""?? The bulk of Michaels' characters in her other works take some convincing before they agree that they are indeed confronting the supernatural... that's what makes those tales believable. Sadly, this book was lacking in that department."
3,2 and a half stars,"I loved Ammie, Come Home and Shattered Silk, two previous Michaels novels with some of the same characters, but this one, though it had some good moments, is nowhere near as well-written. As others have noted, familiar characters have changed for no apparent reason. Instead of a coherent ghost story or mystery, Michaels seems to have dumped the entire contents of ""The Golden Bough"" and other works on folklore and magic into the book--and it's way too long. Worse still, after all that buildup we still don't get a very good payoff in spite of a couple of neat twists at the end.A relatively feeble outing for Ms. Michaels."
1,homeannex distributor,"This company is one of the worst I've dealt with online. Too many problems to describe, however, one was that I was told I would receive my order in approximately two weeks. It was almost six weeks before I received it, with no explanation for the delay."
1,Piece of junk. Worked for ONE day.,"Belkin doesn't even make keyboards anymore, so there's no need to worry. I will say that I loved this keyboard for the day it worked. The key sensitivity was perfect, and everything else about it was the ideal standard, minimalistic keyboard (although I did enjoy the few multimedia keys). After using it for about one day at work, it stopped working. No explanation for it, no reason I could figure out. The lights went off and it never worked again. I tried it in several computers, but no luck. Too bad. I guess Belkin should stick to routers."
2,"Great Content, Poor Print Quality","Incredible and life changing content. Great for men, great and heart-wrenching for the women who love them, invaluable to their children. HOWEVER, the print quality of this paperback is so poor that reading the book for both my husband and me was an incredibly painful chore. I own literally thousands of print books and this is one of only two that I own with such maddeningly sub par print quality. BTW, Man Enough was purchased through Amazon and is the softcover Penguin book."
1,An inadvertant caricature of masculinity well into farcical,"An inadvertant caricature of masculinity well into farcical territory. Pittman uses experiential and cinematic evidence to support his flimsy arguments about manhood. Long on irritating anecdote, way short on substance. Pittman's pawing for recognition he doesn't deserve. Don't bother."
1,Not what I expected,"I paid $50 for what I thought was a very nice coffee table book for my mom's birthday, and it ended up that I paid $50 for a cheap paperback. Total ripoff. Neither of us are satisfied with the product."
5,Addicted to Hollywood Heights!,Based on the spanish novela Alcanzar una Estrella. I am so totally adicted to Hollywood Heights! It is currently playing on teennick but watching each episode once is not enough. I really recomend you watch it!!!!!!!!
2,"Read it once, dont remember much","From the back: He's be her friend but never her loverCaroline's job as a governess at a Mexian hacienda was more demanding than she'd dreamed possible. Her employer, Esteban, was an evil and vulgar man, and he wanted her. She turned for help to Luis de Montejo, Esteban's half brother and a seminarian. But Luis became much more than an ally when Caroline fell desperately in love with him. She knew it was wrong to love him. She told herself she could never have him. But her heart just wouldn't listen...My thoughts: I guess I was bored with the book. I didn't really connect with any of the characters. And since I dont even remember the story, I dont have much to say about this book. I think her other books are infinitely better."
3,Anne Mather,"There was no future, Caroline knew, in her love for Andrew, who was married to a wife who loved and needed him. So she sought escape in far-off Mexico - where she fell in love with a man who was forbidden to her in a way Andrew had never been..."
3,Not So heavy Duty,Well i ordered two of these grinders.. after the first day the first one the switch stopped working... gave it three cause atleast the other one is still working
2,Not the quality for the price.,"After using the grinder for about 5 minutes I decided to send it back to Amazon. If the price was around $30, then I would have kept it. At $58 there are better options. I guess that's the downside of buying online where you can't handle the tool prior to purchase. Amazon processed by return very quickly and there was no hassles at all. Thanks Amazon."
1,Not so flexible product,"This product is only working at 120V and if you are using it only in the US then it may be a good product but I would prefer the other product as the customer service is better in there. Now, if you will use this in and outside of the states, you should buy a grinder with 100-240V power rating otherwise you will have lots of problems with it. Whatever you do don't buy this from United Tools and Fastener. They have poor customer service. They charged me 9 dollars to have the item shipped to me and 12 dollars for me to have it shipped back to them. Very impolite and argues with the customer a lot! What a total rip off. They do not have Return item option in Amazon so you have to contact them directly. The reason for my return is its power rating is unusable for me on other countries."
4,It's a Dewalt,What I expected in that I have purchased dozens of these grinders in the past. We use it commercially so know the quality of this item
5,tillaboro,"A good grinder for around the home, I use it to remove rust and sharpen mower blades, I also purchased a Dewalt wire cone wheel at the same time and this item is hard to wear out. DeWalt is a good brand and stands up to hard use."
2,Lasted one month.,"I bought this nd did not use it for 6 months. I used it 5 times a a piece inside broke. Worthless, maybe I just got a lemon. I have never had any problem with dewalts except for this one."
3,"great mindless material, but way too short! feel like a ripoff",ripoffToo expensive for a really short magazine. Readers digest is way better. This mental floss must be for people who don't like to read because there are no deep articles...just tidbits of info and statistics on random material
2,Waste of time,"Have to agree with the negative reviewers. Lots of disjointed random trivia. Should be called ""Mental Flotsam & Jetsam"" instead. Data is not information is not knowledge is not wisdom. Do yourself a favor: Spend the time reading widely and reading quality materials instead of with this magazine. You'll learn far more and will still be able to fill your brain with as many interesting factoids as you could ever wish."
5,Arrived sooner than expected!,Love this magazine - great for any trivia buff. Wish it came out more often. Arrived ahead of schedule (about 2 weeks after ordered).
3,"Fun, but leaves you hanging","I've picked a couple of these up now and while I enjoyed them, I have to say I was somewhat dissapointed. It's a great source of trivia and random facts, but the entire magazine is only a set of ""factoids"" and few subjects are covered with any kind of depth. All in all, it feels like I'm being given tempting little knowledge hors d'oeuvre with no meal to follow."
4,"Entertaining, but superficial","Mental Floss is a grab-bag of a magazine, filled with short articles on a wide variety of subjects. Its style is consciously wanna-be-hip, with wordplays sprinkled throughout; the name alone is fair warning. It comes across like a hybrid of Wired and Parade Magazine -- light fare for a doctor's waiting room. You'll probably find at least one fascinating fact or connection in any given issue, but there's not much depth."
5,Fascinating--and Just Plain Funny,"The information is interesting and fun, the writing is superb, and the writers and editors have a great sense of humor. I just wish it came out more often!"
5,Refreshing,"Mental Floss continues to provide me with clever bits of information that I can drop into conversations and appear to be magnificently smart. Its approach to the public is refreshing. Though it is generally not a current events magazine, I always feel like I am being given new information. I truly appreciate its seriousness about not being too serious."
5,Impress your friends at cocktail parties...,"...with the knowledge you gain from reading Mental Floss! The great thing about this mag is that it covers such a variety of subject matter that every issue has SOMETHING you're interested in. I like the quirky facts about famous people, and the easy-to-understand explanations of theories developed by history's most influential thinkers. It's great entertainment--I've given it as a gift to several friends, and all are surprised by the unique content and humor. Plus, it's not every day you get to spend leisure time getting smarter. I look forward to the next issue!"
5,Mental Floss is a Great Magazine,"I don't pick up magazines very often, but after picking up an issue of Mental Floss I subscribed the next day. Every article is full of wit and humor, not to mention interesting bits of trivia. It is certainly one of the most entertaining magazines on the market today."
2,I would not recommend,Most of the stories are boring. I waited the entire year to give my opinion. I would not recommend this.
2,"Fun, if it shows up","This magazine is interesting and even fun to read. Unfortunately, in my one year subscrption, I was supposed to get 6 issues. My subscription is up and I received a total of 4. I think I'll pass."
2,Mental_Dross...,"I bought this mag hoping against hope that it would be a stimulating read. Instead I felt like I was just duped into buying a magazine staffed completely by people suffering ADHD. There was NOTHING in depth. I was completely frustrated...in fact I tossed it across the bedroom up finishing! If you are looking for REAL mental stimulation, try WQ or similar DEEP mags.I do give it two stars because it certainly would seem to entertain and cater to most of our culture on speed. So if you are like most popular culture, you will probably like it."
3,Mental Flop,"Although there were some interesting topics in this magazine, you can read most all this stuff on the internet daily newspapers and articles.The issue did NOT change my life. I actually got this for my 80 year old father(professor emeritus), he was not impressed with the magazine. Maybe the coming issues might change our minds(literally).Wish I would have gotten Playboy or Hustler at this point."
2,Not that entertaining or mentally stimulating,"If Maxim had an IQ of 75, Mental Floss barely beats it out with an IQ of 90.Not very stimulating with tid-bits and random facts. Actually not worth spending your time on - might as well do a cross word puzzle or walk your dog."
1,Not Interesting,"This magazine just isn't that interesting. It seems to focus on silly historical facts and doesn't drill down into any interesting or useful current events, topics, or issues. While I think Psychology Today can be light mind-candy I think it has more interesting articles that you find you can apply to your day."
3,A different kind of magazine,Let me start off with I subscribe to at least 15 magazines covering a range of subjects. Mental Floss is the only magazine that I save and leave out for guests. The reason I save it is that is a very quick read that can be read while people have a few moments to spare. The articles are short and don't provide much depth. However it is enjoyable to read something that requires no brain power to process. Mental Floss is a great magazine that you can sit down with and read in one sitting. It even occasionaly brings a smile to your face. I suggest you give it a chance but don't expect to much.
5,"Be patient, it's worth the wait......","For the disgruntled reviewer, when you order through Amazon.com it takes longer to reach the publisher. Amazon.com does state it will be 12-16 weeks, to receive your first magazine after you order. If you ordered in March, chances are you'll start with the June/July issue, as the publication is a bimonthly. Sometimes the double month's issue i.e. June/July is referred to as July. I'm betting you'll start with that issue. There may be some confusion, as far as when you are starting, as compared to what issue you are starting with.I have been a subscriber for a while, & expect the June/July issue to arrive towards the end of May, if the schedule remains the way it's been previously. The magazine, as well as the customer service is superior by far. Give it a chance, I'm sure you'll be ""VERY PLEASED"" in the long run. I've renewed my subscription up to the year 2007, I enjoy the magazine so much! Trust me, once you start receiving it, you'll be delighted!"
5,Go get a copy today!,"I bought an issue of Mental Floss at the bookstore after reading an article about it in the Washington Post. It is certainly the most enjoyable, irreverant perodical out there today. Beyond just factoids and useless information, the editors seem to strive to put knowledge into context, so that when you are waxing on the industrial revolution's relationship to Marxism at your next party, you'll actually know what you are talking about! I think this magazine would be a great gift for anybody, but it is certainly perfect for young people with a thirst for knowledge. The perfect thing to have on the coffee table of your first apartment. Go buy a copy today!"
2,Where am I?,"Of course it's meant to be a collection of bits and pieces to wake-up those synapses - so the scattered format shouldn't be a surprise - but it is. Disorder is no problem for me - I have a high tolerance for ambiguity. So think about what kind of floss you're seeking - content brainteasers or process challenges(readability). This gives some of both. Content: Some articles are pretty ordinary - stuff most people know already - but other tidbits are in depth additions thst are new and fun for any trivia hound. As for readability: It takes a lot of concentration to find your way through each page-let alone the whole magazine. I will continue to subscribe, but I do wish they would string together just a few of those loose ends which serve not to 'floss'the brain but instead to burn out the reader's neurosynaptic connections."
5,Great gift for friends who have everything they need,"I just got my first issue. Great light reading with trivia and things to think about and ponder: 10 technologies we stole from the animal kingdom, 10 messiest food festivals, 10 not-so-bright ideas, etc. I believe I'll like this magazine."
1,Shallow Shallow Shallow,"Don't waste your money on this soundbite deception. The title does not live up to itself. There's nothing mental about it other then the word in the name of the magazine. This publication amounts to a whole lot of trivia and maybe one feature article in the middle of the magazine, no depth, just hype and snippets of esoterica. I felt so disappointed and deceived as the build up sounded quite promising. Invest in something else worthwhile like ""Atlantic"", ""American Scholar"", or ""Commentary"". This was a real waste of money; if you don't believe it go ahead and see for a fee."
2,Much less interesting than expected,As other reviewers have pointed out this magazine does at times ask some interesting and unusual questions. However the answers leave you unquinched for the pondered idea. The articles are filled with mindless jabber meant to entertain but which often are annoyingly covering for the lack of journalistic research. This magazine was not worth my time. I generously gave it two stars for some creative questions and occasionally having an adequetly covered article.
2,Too Snarky For My Taste,"I was hoping for an Unte Reader-lite type magazine to share with my students. Instead, Mental Floss is just a bunch of assorted trivia pieces. Worse yet, they use the same snarky, condescending tone that rags like Entertainment Weekly and Rolling Stone have been using. I have grown very tired of hearing the writers voice. Some of the articles have good bits of party knowledge sure, but you would just be better off hitting the random button on Wikipedia."
1,Train Wreck,"This is an absolute train wreck of a magazine. I ordered it because all the other customer reviews were so positive and because I like trivia like jeopardy, trivial pursuit, etc. I have no idea how any intelligent person could enjoy this magazine or gain any knowledge from it. For instance the first issue I received was about the 25 most influential movies of all time. I don't remember much from that article except that toy story made the cut. Toy story. I think the only other article in the magazine between the hundreds of ads was about how many time Abe Lincoln wanked off a day or something. Okay that's not exactly true but you get my drift. This is not a magazine for people with even a mild intellect. Its basically watered down maxim articles without the scantily clad ladies. Remind me again what the point of this magazine is? Save your money."
2,Save your Money,"I wonder who came up with ""Mental Floss""? It's more like ""Can you Think""? Very little in this gloss that you wouldn't find in your local paper, near the trivia questions and funny pages. Nothing...zero...nata. Save a tree."
1,Poor Content and Poor Customer Service,"I was disappointed with this magazine. The trivia it containsis often either not interesting or is common knowledge.More importantly, I tried to cancel my subscription and get arefund for the remaining issues but have yet to receive a refundafter several months of correspondence."
2,Overrated,"Ordered this for my father. He loves Kiplinger, Bottom Line, USA Today and other publications. He said this was a nice thought, but terrible."
1,THE BEST REVIEW YOU'LL EVER READ,"dO not order MENtle floss Magazin. it preetends to be sMart but It's just a teaz. Covers intersting toppics, aks good qestions but the ansers are lackng. Each issu has half a page of corections frm the preevius issu. whats the point of reeding a mag whitch promises to mak you smarter if its not so clevver itself? Like ths revue, it dosn't live upto it's claims."
3,More like a pamphlet than a magazine,"So, I'll start off by saying I really like Mental Floss and have read a few of the books. That said, this magazine is thin. I expected a little more substance for a magazine with only 8 issues, but unfortunately it's quite the opposite. For the money, I'm going to go back to reading the books."
3,"Great Magazine, But Slow To Deliver","I love Mental Floss but it is a little slow on delivery, as some of the other reviewers have complained. I wonder if there's a way they could speed this up? That said, if you get it you will be happy once it arrives. The facts are fun and unique and the graphics are good too."
4,"Enjoyable, but not essential","A magazine dedicated to trivia could get tiring very fast. Thankfully, each issue of Mental Floss carries a handful of stories that are absolutely fascinating, touching on bits of history that you never knew existed. Will it make you smarter? Probably not; tryGamesfor that. Will it give more depth to your understanding of history? Not really; you're better off reading primary sources in Lapham's Quarterly. But will it entertain you with delightful wit? Absolutely."
5,The smart thing? subscribe to The Floss!,"i've been a big fan of mental floss since its inception. every issue continues to impress me and the magazine just keeps getting better. the magazine is not only funny and entertaining, but also a wonderful resource for anyone with a love of learning. there is no other magazine like it! i've shared this magazine with friends and family here in california and its been a huge hit out here. in spite of the magazine's fresh and somewhat irreverent appearance, people of all ages would appreciate its content. i highly recommend this magazine!im looking forward to the mental floss boardgame and calendar!"
5,My favorite Christmas CD,"I am not a huge John Tesh fan, but I do love this CD. In fact, this would be the second time that I have bought this particular collection of music. The first time was when the CD first came out, and you could only buy it on cassette tape! A decade later I have finally replaced it to CD and am delighted that I have. The whole CD is one that you can put in the player, curl up on your couch with some spiked eggnog and watch the fire burn down. It is an inspiring as it is relaxing, brings back memories of a quieter, and somehow nicer world than the one we all currently live in. It is not a piano pounding John Tesh, but the musical arrangements do have his mark on some of them. And this CD has my favorite rendition of Ava Maria. A mixture of classical, contemporary, choral and instrumental, I believe this is ""THE"" Christmas CD to own."
4,Nice music,The disc was a slight bit warped but it didn't have any problems downloading to the computer. There was no problems with playback. It came in on-time. Great sounds for the season.
3,"Good, but incomplete","Anytime an album (CD) is labeled ""Best of"", it can be someone's personal opinion. The Best of Mancini is a good-quality recording, but lacks many of what I would consider Mancini's best (or most important) performances. To be a true ""Best of Mancini"" would require at LEAST a three-CD set. This one is an OK teaser."
4,A new twist on a popular series,"Mark Shepherd's Elvendude introduces the Lackey/Shepherd readership to a new, exciting family of elves. A spin-off from the SERRAted Edge series, we meet the ""elvendude,"" Adam McDaris, a teenaged kid in Dallas who doesn't know he's an elf. Good take on the trauma of adolescence, and of drug addiction, which he deals with here with sensitivity and (maybe?) from experience. Despite the dark aspects of the subject matter, Shepherd brings humor and life to the story, and handles the characterization and plotting like a champ. I believe this is his first solo book, but it reads like the fruits of an experienced, seasoned novelist. I look forward to more from him; he shows tremendous potential."
3,Hilarious!,"The book in and of itself isn't as good as the general Serrated Edge series, IMO, but I have to admit, the ideas presented inside ... some of them are too funny. If you're a fan of the series, you should definitely read it -- and if not, it's a good bit of humor!"
5,Best You Can Get,"I have had a Panasonic Linear Shaver for almost 2 years. It is the only electric that can shave my tough beard as smooth as a safety razor. It is best when used with shaving gel rather than dry. Never cuts or irritates my skin. Previously, I had tried just about all major brands and found Braun to be acceptable. But the Panasonic is, by far the best electric I have ever used."
3,Nothing to Write Home abt,"It has problems picking up hair that lie parallel to the skin. This means that the shaver did not work great with the hair between the neck and the chin. It took many passes to get at areas that are not flat. The shaver took too much of my skin, leaving it irritated. It works well enough so I will not return it, but I will not buy another one after this one is broken. I will get a Norelco instead."
4,Great razor and I have a tough beard and usually hate them!,"I have had a few electric razors and all of them would leave hair behind, burn my face and give me a rash or just be totally useless as a shaver. However, this one really gets the job done. It charges in record time as well. This is a really good electric razor for even tough beards like mine but it is still not as good as a safety razor, cream, and a warm towel."
2,"Insightful, But Dull","I would not have bought this book had it not been required material for a class I'm taking. Ah, the wonders of studying psychology at an private Christian school. While the scholarship is competent, this is not a fun read by any means.My favorite part of it is yet to come, when the semester is over with, I don't need it any more, and it becomes a target for my .308 Mosin/Nagan."
2,It works as a helmet but isn't the best one out there,"I am sure the safety of this helmet is good. I have not had a crash so luckily have not had to test that. But I am sure it will work well as a helmet.The issues I have with this helmet is that it fits the head really oddly, it makes your head look REALLY round. It looks like your wearing a goofy space helmet, not very attractive. The chin strap does not have a button to pin the slack strap to the helmet. Any slack strap just kinda hangs there in the way. Another problem I have with it, is that the visor does not fit well. You kinda have to manhandle it to get it on the snaps. It often unsnaps from the helmet and gets all crooked again. Really unless if you think this helmet looks amazing, go and find another you will probably like it more."
4,Great low cost helmet,"Really like this helmet. It fits great. I was worried about sizing issues due to other comments, but had no issues. I wear a large helmet and ordered a large. When it arrived I put it on and it fit perfectly. Not too loose not too tight, but the perfect snugness you want from a helmet. The only complaint I have is that the visor snaps aren't that great. It's difficult sometimes to get them lined up and when you think it is snapped securely it's not, but when you do get them snapped properly it stays on just fine."
4,Great helmet for the price,"I ordered this to wear because my adult daughter has autism and has temper issues which means she is going to pull my hair. :) I use this for those times so I won't lose all my hair, LOL It looks crazy wearing it around the house but it works!"
1,One size shell,"For those looking at the small medium sizes.. dont bother. They design this shell one size, so if you order small the shell would be the same as the XL sizes. It looks ridiculous big on my small head."
3,bobble head,I got this helmet thinking it would look a lot different than it would. I have owned a few open face helmets in the past but this one was huge. The fit was great I ordered a small when in any other helmet I wear a medium so no complaints about the fit but it is way bigger than even a large helmet I own.
4,Nice helmet,This is a comfortable and sturdy helmet. Very lightweight but still feels safe. Love the visor. Bought one for my daughter as well.
4,Raider Helmut,Delivered as promised in excellant condition. Be sure of the size you order. Returns because you ordered the wromg size are at your exspense.
5,An excellent masterpiece!,"Words are useless to describe this masterpiece created by David Macaulay.I have visited France (more specifically Paris, Rheims, Chartres, Chambord, Versailles, Chenonceau) and went on a ""cathedral pilgrimage"" to see all the greatest French gothic cathedrals.After picking up this book in my local library, I was spellbound by the beauty of Macaulay's drawings. Macaulay is able to recreate the majesticness and grandeur of the cathedrals and draws you into the cathedral. You can almost hear the cathedral choir singing in the backround and the quite chanting of the people.Macaulay's drawings are first rate (no wonder this masterpiece won the Caldacot Medal!)This book should be read by everyone to show what people can achieve through determination and having a united goal.This just occurred to me.... why do man's most significant and most beautiful works of art and architecture result from their religion?David Macaulay's book is pure gold! BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!"
3,Cathedral,"I knew before purchasing that this book was intended for the younger readers, but I thought that in presenting the topic it would make it easier for friends my age to get a very general idea on the subject of cathedral building. In this respect it met my expectations. The presentation is good and does tell a story that is easy to understand, and perhaps enough so that further reading on the subject might be of interest."
3,"Fascinating, but short on detail.","I bought this work, and one other MacAulay book, Castle, in the hope of learning some of the intricate details of these Medieval engineering marvels. Sadly there is a dearth of detail in both of these books and they are disappointingly brief. Admittedly, these are children's books and designed for kids' limited attention spans and lack of technical background. For this reason I give the books five stars for young readers. Adult readers will find their appetites for information insufficiently whetted and I can only provide three stars for them."
2,another cathedral story,"Unfortunately, the information I'd been provided on this book did not include the fact that it is very basic. I had been looking for more technical detail. I provided a starting place for other sources, however."
2,Didn't last long!,"We loved the monitor at first. The features are nice and the price was reasonable. Then, without event or explanation, it died one day and we haven't been able to recharge one of the handheld units. Maybe we got a dud?"
2,"Usually works, not perfect","We've had them for a couple years now and in our old house, they worked great though seemed to get more glitchy with each passing month. In the new house, they are working pretty poorly, often disconnecting and sometimes not relaying any sound without giving an indication that they aren't working. Personally, I would try a different product."
3,If you live in an Apartment Building Beware,"We like the monitor and the Walkie-talkie function is fine. But beware that if you live in an apartment building you might get cross radio waves from your neighbors phone conversations. Also it makes a loud static noise and wakes us up in the middle of the night, worse than a baby crying and we don't know what it is. It's very disturbing. Our theory is a Nextel ringing."
1,Died awfully fast,We loved this monitor...while it worked. The walkie-talkie feature and rechargeable batteries are particularly great. But it died without warning after five months of use -- and Evenflo provides a pathetic 90-day warranty. We'll be shopping other brands for a replacement.
5,Exactly what we were looking for!,"My husbands 86 year old mother moved in with us and is almost completely immobile. We live in a three story home and were in need of a monitor so she could get our attention any time she wants. This unit is great because she doesn't have to press a button, she just calls out and either my husband or I can hear her on one of the two mobile units. It is also nice to be able to press a button and speak to her so we can find out what she needs or just to reassure her we're on our way."
4,Sound Purchase,No problems with device. Enjoy the two handsets and being able to talk to my child without going in the room. When talking between handsets annoying beep in sets when connecting. For price and expectations would buy again...
3,"I love the old school kung fu period, this aint it!!","Unfortunately this movie was not what it suppose to be. According to the plot, it was one brother trying to find and kill his other brother, after being caught attempting to rape is sister in law. However, this movie was quite different,,it turned out to be some killer cop, hunting down some gold robbers,,chopping there heads off one at a time. However, don't get me wrong, I'm not into swords play, but this was not bad, especially the final 5 mins. I just like to get what I buy seen!!!"
1,Old school collectors - beware!!!,"This film is completely dreadful, the first challenge will be to stay awake throughtout the film; the second will be to wonder why on earth you wasted your money as the 'fighting' scenes are poor and bear no resemblance to the description on the case of the DVD. Look for a different film."
3,poor man's brent easton ellis,"this book was okay. i had to read it when i was trapped in a hostage situation in a bank and so i mean i didn't really identify with the main character because i mean who wants to read about a loser whose girlfriend just left him really? but since i didn't have anything else to do - you feel his pain, it definately brought back some of the teenage heartache feelings which was fun to revisit but otherwise the book was just more of the new york city, postmodernish, rich people who don't have any money, xanax loving embracing their bourgeouis decadent problems but this guy still writes about diaphrams and just for kicks i asked my pseudo-girlgriend if she wanted to use a diaphram and she didn't even know what it was."
2,A well-written rehash,"It has been said that everybody has precisely one authentic story to tell. McInerney clearly told that story in Bright Lights, and hasn't been able to change the formula significantly--alternating between ""experimental"" books (such as Ransom and Last of the Savages), and the same New-York-professional-whose-life-is-falling-to-sh*t fallback tale (Bright Lights, Story of My Life, Brightness Falls, and Model Behavior).He's a fantastic stylist, however, and the book is exceptionally well-written and entertaining, as long as you literally expect no new material beyond what you saw in Bright Lights."
4,short stories are better than novella,"If you like the style of McInerney, then I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying the paperback or a used version of this book. I would just skip the title and read the short stories. Some of them are up there with Carver!-Borden Burns"
1,"Lazy, pathetic, annoying, and shallow",This book was a great disappointment in every way. The highlight was the discussion of nematodes in Florida. A complete waste of time!
1,Where's the story?,"Expecting a book that was similar in quality to ""Bright Lights..."", I was understandably disappointed after only 50 pages into this book. I got the feeling that Jay was told to have a book done by a specific date by his publisher, and he put off writing it until the night before. There was no depth in either his characters or his story. I think Jay read too many of his New York reviews and forgot that the US is larger than just New York City. The worst part is the price. I would gladly have paid the extra amount for this book if it was half as good as ""Bright Lights"". But instead, this book is worth $9 less that its requested price. Don't waste your money."
3,so-so,"The actual novel wasn't bad, and I liked the main character. However, once I finished the novel and started the short stories, I lost all interest in reading whatsoever. I think he should have just stuck with the novel and left it as that"
2,Disappointment,"I read the glowing comments on the cover. I read reviews saying what a witty and talented author McInerney is. I read ten pages of this peice of garbage. I found some evidence of his wit, but he seemed as disinterested in his characters as I became. I agree with the gentleman who thought the book was done to meet a deadline. It certainly couldn't have been any less compelling."
1,This book was beyond bad...,"(I'd give it 0 stars if I could.)What a total disapointment.I was really looking forward to reading J.I's new book and as soon as I bought a copy of ""Model Behavior"" I dove into it. Little did I know that I was jumping into a empty swimming pool and would hit my head on the cement within the first few pages.This book is a self-centered piece of crap. The throw-backs to J.I's life in the 1980's when he was one of the literary world's ""flavor of the month"" were nauseating. His constant name-dropping was annoying. And the fact that he had the nerve to even mention his own name in a fictional book review just shows that J.I doesn't care about writing good fiction. His only concern seems to be wanting to be a star again. Good luck dear...your 15 minutes has come and gone.PLEASE...do not waste your time reading this book."
1,Return to sender!,I can't believe how lazy this book is. The author literally takes the plot of his one and only hit book (*how* long ago was that now?) and totally recycles it for a new decade. Give me a break...
2,Prince of the Pastry Cart,"There's no denying McInerney's talent for glibly flowing prose, and a facility for lip-curling one-liners...and yet...I can't help feeling the slightness of all this. Kidding the linked worlds of fashion, Hollywood and celebrity glamour is just too easy a task, not to mention the author's helpless adoration of what he pretends to lampoon. McInerney's tales from the land of gloss, far from rocking the boat, actually exist to convey his own insider's status. I always hoped JM would develop into a substantial writer of three dimensions (which does occur in places in BRIGHTNESS FALLS) but overall he seems terminally pleased with his position as ""Prince of the Pastry Cart."" Then there are the forgettable magazine stories (some of them over 10 years old!) tacked on to this book to jack it up to salable length. I'm disappointed, and will re-read my copy of THE DAY OF THE LOCUST."
4,Cowboys will sing,This is quite a good Roy Rogers' film. He's more than adequate and his singing is pleasant. A good story with some exciting moments and good supporting actors.Annette.
1,Poorly written and not meant for new users,This book is a total waste of money. It is more like a boring reference manual. The free online book available from macromedia is far superior and well written (can be downloaded from macromedia site. It is about 2.5MB acrobat file)
2,Don't waste your money,There is nothing in this book that isn't better in the Macromedia online documetation. There are no great insites or techniques. The examples are terrible.
3,Go to the Dreamweaver Website before you buy this book.,"The book makes a good reference book, no doubt about it. However, you can get just as much info from the dreamweaver Website at Macromedia for free. So I'm taking it back."
3,I only bought it because version 3 wasn't out.,The book goes through the basics of Dreamweaver. The problem was that they needed to publish the Dreamweaver 3 book sooner because I was stuck buying this version.The book does teach alot of tricks and how to use the tools needed. Pay attention to the javascript behaviors that are included in the Dreamweaver that the book teaches.You can get everything in the book at the Macromedia site though. It's a good book for beginners!
1,No Dreamweaver 2.0 in this book!,I just upgraded to Dreamweaver 2.0 and bought this book to learn the myriad of new features in 2.0. This book is for the old 1.2 version of Dreamweaver ONLY - nothing in this book or at the companion web site will help you learn Dreamweaver 2.0. This book is a total waste of money if you want to learn the basics of the Dreamweaver 2.0 upgrade.
1,Minus One Star - Don't waste your time or money!,"Found the book poorly organized, the examples are terrible, you have to keep flipping back and forth and still author does not teach in any linear way. I found the online book from Macromedia far superior, and would not buy another book by this author."
5,The soft color illustrations reinforce the inviting message of the parent-child bond,"I Chose You is an endearing picturebook. Told from the point of view of a parent, the story begins, ""One day in heaven a long time ago, Heavenly Father led me by the hand into a big room filled with children. He told me that today was a special day; it was the day I got to pick out my very own child."" The story and inviting illustrations show all sorts of boys and girls, each with different likes and dislikes, from math and painting to football, camping, computers and video games. And out of the long line of wonderful possibilities, ""I looked at every one of those children. And I chose you."" The soft color illustrations reinforce the inviting message of the parent-child bond."
2,Info Too Sparse,I was disappointed in the too-brief description of the plants. Not enough info. Perhaps typically Taylor's but I expected more.
2,Not what I listened to Swans for,"I _really_ like Swans during a particular stretch of their discography (The Burning World, White Light from the Mouth of Infinity, Love of Life, The Great Annihilator). This Angels of Light is not at all similar to what I liked about Swans. I am sorry I bought it."
2,Close but no cigar,"M. Gira has not even come close to being a complete thought since those early years. Every release, on the surface seems interesting, but they all ultimately are missing something vital, something that gives them a life. Its very hard to describe. It always seems as though I am listening to a demo or a work in progress. This latest project ""Angels"" seem to take itself so seriously in all the strangest ways, it is almost a bit insulting to be honest. I have heard all of these melodies before, but now I am supposed to take them more seriously because M. Gira has decided to sing over them. If you like ""Angels"" it just seems like there are other bands/people doing this whole mood/sound better and with more honesty. To see people comparing Gira to Tom Waits or Cohen is a bit disturbing to me, because I just don't think Gira's music brings the same class of writing and depth. Anyway, If your a fan, your a fan, and probably not to interested in hearing this."
5,Great if you love the music and zoids,"I'm a big fan of the show. What I really liked about the show is the music (thanks Robert Etoll).My only problem with this cd is it is (volume)+3.I've tracked down +1 (the season with bit cloud), but I haven't found +2 or +4.My favorites (the ones with the guitars) are on this cd.Omitted are the ones when Fionna was having herhallucinations :-(Also omitted was the music when Van & Zeke pulled off the impossible.THIS CD has alot of ZOID info and MACROMEDIA FILES for your COMPUTER!!!Anyway, besides the omissions, this cd still worth it!!"
4,Zoids CD,I havn't listen to it yet but I am a big zoids fan. I have 2 tapes full of the show. I think I'll get this cd pretty soon.
3,As fun as I remembered,"Anastasia is back with another hilarious caper. This time she decides to get a job as a ""companion to a wealthy, elderly woman."" Instead, she is hired as a maid. Hi-jinks ensue.Anastasia continues to be a very realistic character, surrounded by wacky secondary characters, getting into odd situations, but learning lessons very common to pre-teens. Recommended."
5,The best Anastasia book yet!!!!!,"Anastasia At Your Service is the best Anastasia book. She wants to be a companion but ends up as a maid! It was very humorous, for any age. If I were you, I'd buy this book."
2,what I think.,"I would not recomend this book because there was no suspense, noaction, no nothing. it was dead!"
3,"The first one is ""BORN TO BE WILD"" but the other two are ""BAD TO THE BONES!""","This collection can be very cool for someone that is only looking for blood and gore! but for me was not perfect:* The first movie is the best, BLOODY, CREEPY and HORRIBLE!!* The second movie is the WORST of the three! The blood was tune down, few killings, the storyline is very slow and the story itself SUCKED!!* The third movie was so-so! At least better than the second one. There is BLOOD AND GORE and some of the baby monsters are big now! But that's it! The rest was NOT GOOD!P.S: The only movie that should be rated R is the third one. Because the first movie is very bloody but not gory, the second movie is NOTHING bloody or gory, the third movie is the one that is bloody and gory but it wasn't THAT good.Adios."
2,on life support -- is more like it,"this thing just dragged on and on.i have never been so happy to see the end credits in a movie for a while.but it isn't just the boredom of the movie that bothered me.the characters also behaved in ways that were not realistic or logical,even when carrying out mundane routines.add to that the fact that the movie was about as scary as the energizer bunny,and you got one big misfire.however,having seen a few thousand movies in my time,i can honestly say this is nowhere near the worst movie i have had the misfortune of sitting through.it just isn't very good.it's followed by two sequels,which(after sitting through this movie)i can say with 100% certainty i definitely won't be watching,so something good came out of it.for me,It's Alive is a 2/5"
1,snoring all the way,"this movie is just terrible, I don't think any kind of horror film can get any worst than this one"
4,It's good to be Alive!,"All three Alive films are here in good transfers for your viewing pleasure, these films are better than all the new junk being released these days. Also check out two more films-- Class of 1999 and Screamers for an authentic sci-fi experience.I love the line in the 3rd film, where Michael is asked who he is at a party, and he responds ""I'm the father of the monster."""
3,It's lives on!,"This trilogy is a favorite of mine. I watched it back when I was a child. Once I saw how these now horror movies are missing certain elements. I figured, how about go back and watched those movies that have that missing element. The missing element is, the cheap shot. The part were it makes you jump out of your seat. These movies have it. If your interested in watching this cult classic here are some other favorite's of mine.The legend of Boggy Creek, The Beast Within, Dario Agento's Demons, Rosemary's Baby, Sleepaway camp, and Halloween."
5,Awesome,I love this video.You have to be familiar with Yolanda's earlier works to really appreciate this video but she is so real and sounds so good!!
3,Yolanda Adams - Live in Concert,"Great singing and praising, but somehow disappointed at the content and the way the DVD has been put together. I compared this DVD with Bebe Winans and the package that he delivered is of a better qaulity."
2,LONGING FOR A PROPER DVD,"I previewed this DVD at a music shop and I was disappointed with what I saw. I love Yolanda's ""The battle's is the Lord's"" and I have a couple of CD's by her, however I saw this DVD after I had purchased CC Winans ""The Throne Room"" DVD and Kirk Whalum's ""Gospel according to Jazz Chapter II"" DVD, and I was appalled by the poor quality of Yolanda's offering. That small stage, so cramped! Mostly she stands in one spot. The lighting is poor. It's impossible to see other musicians on stage. Those antiqueted boxes for the different sections? Yolanda obviously still owes her fans a DVD. The song selection is okay though."
1,Not worth it.,"Purchased this for the price and knowing DeWalt makes some pretty decent products.This is not one of them.I own a Marble and Granite fabrication shop and this grinder lasted 2 weeks then burned out.Go for a makita, last 10x longer."
3,Quakehold 7 inch steel furniture cable,"I ordered 3, 7 inch steel straps. I received 2, 7 inch and 1, 3 inch strap. Even though all 3 packages had 7 inches on them. The straps are easily installed. on the wall and on the furniture."
1,Terrible Amazon and Swisher service!!,"Great price but that was it!! hydrostatic drive was broken within 3 minutes, and three days later it is still sitting in my driveway!! Swisher won't even answer a phone after three days of calling continuously and Amazon suddenly says they don't have anymore but will credit me whenever they get their shipper to pick it up and return it to their warehouse which has been three days and one full day (off work) waiting for the shipment!!! and still no schedule of pick-up! STRONGLY do not recommend, amazon customer service was even worse!! can't say enough BAD things about the whole transaction!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I had an old sun shade that just wasn't what it used to be. So, I purchased this one after reading the reviews. I received it last night. I used it during my lunch time today. When returning to my car to drive back to work, I was very disappointed. My new sun shade had large bubbles in it in several places. Spend your money on some other sun shade. This one is not worth anything."
2,Better go to wal mart,It doesn't worth the price. Better go to Wal-Mart (or another store) and get a cheaper one.
2,Hammer Films' slow moving horror combined with Shaw Studios' brisk martial arts melees,Hammer Films' slow moving horror and squirming nubiles combined with Shaw Studios' brisk martial arts melees. It's an odd and marginally successful combination. Often awkward but with personable stars. Especially funny watching some of the Chinese vampires half-hopping about; apparently they had played Chinese hopping vampires and had a little trouble adapting to the European style. Or maybe it was intentional.
1,Horrible Hammer Flick,"This is one of the worst Hammer Movies Ever Made this is even considerd to be a Sequel to ""Satanic Rites of Dracula"" NO IT ISNT this is not a sequel has nothing to do with the Dracula Series if this is a Sequel there are a few things Wrong with This1. Satanic Rites of Dracula took place in ""1974"" This happens in ""1904"" NO SEQUEL2. The Van Helsing in this can't be the one from the previous one or from ""Horror of Dracula""3. This could have been the prequel to ""Horror of Dracula"" if they had stuck with the year the movie starts in which is ""1804"" Because ""Horror"" starts in the year ""1885"" but they messed it upDont bother with this one I only got this because I am a Big Fan of Hammer. Dracula ""John Forbes Robinson"" Looks Horrible in this"
1,How the memories of youth cloud our vision,"I remembered watching this movie years ago, when I was addicted to Kung Fu Theater and Run-Run SHaw movies. I loved it then. So when I saw that this movie was available on DVD, I rushed to get it. Man, am I sorry. All those golden memories of my teenage years were clearly a hallucinogenic manifestation, a TIA, falsely planted in my brain by subversive aliens, or all of the above. This was really a crappy, crappy movie. I didn't even finish watching it. Disillusionment has set in, and I am wondering if dynamiting my copy of this DVD will restore me."
4,One Of The Best!,"As a child my father took me to see this movie one Saturday afternoon in 1979 when it was released as The Seven Brothers Meet Dracula. This was the movie that put me on to the old school martial arts film with the fantastic special effects. Also being groomed by a grandfather who was an avid horror flick fan,I honestly say that you get the best of both worlds in one tremendously action packed film. I saw this movie when I was 6 years old and have been searching high and low for it for 20 years. This film is a definite must for anyone who claims to be a collector of movies such as Master Killer or the old fashioned horror film bfore they all became slash and gore."
3,Goofy fun!,"I hadn't heard much about the film before I bought it, save for the following: vampires, zombies, kung-fu and... Peter Cushing!!! Combining all those elements together, I just knew I couldn't stay away from this movie! I went in expecting it to be extremely cheesy (like most Hammer films), yet extremely fun to watch (also like most Hammer films). Needless to say, I was not disappointed. Once again, Peter Cushing turns in a great performance as vampire hunter extraordinaire Professor Van Helsing."
3,Entertaining hybrid of horror and martial arts,"The movie begins with a rather stupid opening sequence with the Chinese villain Ka asking Dracula (not Christopher Lee this time) to resurrect the 7 Golden Vampires. Though Ka is speaking Chinese and Drac is speaking English, somehow they both understand what the other is saying. Soon Dracula takes on Ka's image and goes about creating an undead army to attack a small village. Billed as ""the first kung fu horror spectacular"" (Why wasn't the movie called ENTER THE VAMPIRE? You can imagine Bruce Lee in this) there are some exciting martial arts sequences and a good cast led by horror legend Peter Cushing, once again in his role as Van Helsing. Another special highlight is Julie Ege's generous bosom; her accent is also delighfully, chillingly erotic.(Or maybe that's just my overabundance of testosterone speaking for me). Anyhow this is a fun, unique horror/ kung fu flick. A minor cult classic ripe for rediscovery."
5,Great transaction,"Excellent seller, smooth transaction. I highly recommend this book and this seller to everyone. It shows the difference between been white and been a person pf color as well as been elite and been of anyother social class. It all relates to aging and social rank."
4,Nice escapism,"I felt like I was taken on the ride along with the characters, but you have to be in a really chill mood to properly enjoy it. Also, the ""Cameos"" by then unknown actors is great fun! Try to spot Don Cheadle!"
4,I'm the black sheep.,"Okay, am I the only one who thought this was the cheesiest movie ever? I'll give it a good review because Adrock shows off his crazy acting skills, but it was a MAD CHEESY flick."
3,A road movie with Motorcycles.,"This movie was a fairly corny late 90's biker flick. It was nothing like a corny late 60's biker flick. John Doe and that Beastie Boy kid show that they have about as much acting talent as musical talent, which isn't much. This is just one of those movies that you buy if it's cheap enough and you're a die hard biker flick fan (like me). Like most in this genre, the story wasn't very interesting. That's not a big deal if there are loads of vintage cycles in the picture, but that is not the case here. Not much other than the Triumph and '57 Harley here. There are a few laughs and some interesting cameo's (Timothy Leary comes to mind) but I couldn't say that I'd really recommend this movie to anybody but the most hardcore biker movie fan.Well, that's it. I'm off to Alaska."
1,Terrible and Hossless...,"No Hoss. Poor fellow died prior to this episode, so we don't get to see the big guy. But that's not what makes this episode terrible. If you want to see what really killed off this series, watch Landon (Little Joe) overacting in this reinterpretation of ""The Miracle Worker"". Painful! Poor Altman and Landon were just doing their jobs. The blame goes to the scriptwriter and producer of this wasted effort. IMPORTANT NOTE: The DVD does NOT use the original ""Bonanza"" title theme, which was probably too expensive for them to procure, but substitutes a nice little alternative country-music ditty. Should be banned from all reissue. Not worth watching, even for Altman fans. Thank goodness my two favorite Altman films have recently been made available on DVD: ""Three Women"" and ""Images"""
2,Fountain flop,"I just received this fountain yesterday. There are two problems with it. You can't actually use the copper bowl as a planter if you want to use the fountain because you would have to dig out the plant whenever you wanted to clean It.. And the pump only provides a slow trickle of water. I have tried adjusting the pressure but to no avail. I will try and find a stronger pump that actually has the pressure to push the water up thru such a long channel. Other than that, it is pretty. Big disappointment. I would send it back but it's too awkward to repackage and the box was all torn up when it arrived."
4,For those who admire jazz,"I bought this CD mainly because I have enjoyed the duet's ""16 Most Requested Songs (1958-1961)"", which is a superb CD. Sadly, this 30 song collection left me rather frustrated. True, there are 30 fantastic tracks on this CD covering the ""golden"" era of Les Paul and Mary Ford (1949-1955); yet it means the quality of the remastered tracks is unsteady and stylistically the music appeals to jazz listeners, rather than pop. Moreover, I was disappointed also because out of these 30 tracks only 9 contain Mary's vocal. Also the ""booklet"" doesn't include any information, just a track listing.If you admire the jazz side of Les Paul, then you would enjoy it very much. But I'm going to look for something more pop-orientated and with more vocal contribution from Mary, maybe more of their Columbia period (1957-1963)."
1,Horrible Quality!!!!,This has to be the worse CD I've ever listened to. What a disgrace to use these very talented people to sell a reproduction of this poor quality by these history making musicians.... Sounds like a little child's toy guitar was use....It's Tinny and the speed is to fast.... Sounds like when you run a 33 1/3 at 45.... A Real Shame... Buy something else... Doesn't even deserve 1 star....
4,Golden Oldies,This came all the way from the US and arrived efficiently and promptly. The CD was exactly as expected
3,"Good CD, sound so good","This CD covers most of Les Paul's hits, which was what I was looking for. The sound is a bit ""tinny"", however, which detracts from the overall experience. I found a similar CD which has much better sound quality."
1,Very disappointing,"i was so looking forward to this CD as it had many tracks new to me. I was so upset to find it was mostly Les Paul, I wanted to hear Mary Ford sing. The few tracks on which she appeared were short, minimal, and very poor quality. These could not have been the original recordings. Frsnkly I threw it out after the first attempt at listening. CfK 2/25/11"
1,Disappointing,This modern version of Les Paul/Mary Ford music is often dissonant and not pleasing. I need a CD which contains their original music and orchestration.
1,Misappropriating Darwin,"The book disappoints. Factually, there are very powerful cases of non-human animal bonding that exceeds even so-called normal human bonding. Secondly, the author neglects to take seriously the 'argument from marginal cases'. So, for example, autistic children, senile and retarded adult humans and the like, are simply incapable of even the minimal bonding that the author believes inhabits 'normal' humans. The result, on parity of reasoning, is that these marginal humans deserve lesser moral treatment. This seems at odds with our considered moral beliefs; indeed, many of us would think that these humans deserve extra care and consideration. The book is rather philosophically naive and leaves obvious objections unaddressed."
2,Not pleased with the language,"I love Dellen Allen as a dancer, but I was not pleased with this book. No foul language was used in the book, but there was alot of name calling, words and phrases I would not want my 5 year to hear or say. Maybe this book is not for a 5 year old but I would not want my child to think it is okay to call one of ones family member out of their name."
5,"Funny, charming, inspiring","This is the cutest story ever! Any family or culture can relate to its story morale but it is especially delightful for an African American family who enjoy the arts. My daughter just started ballet lessons, so I got her some stories about ballet. This one is our favorite. My five year old and 11 year old girls both enjoyed it. The story is perfect from building self esteem, solving sibling conflict and teaching persistence. Debbie Allen has great story telling abilities (loved all the characters) and the illustrator did a great job portraying black beauty and I was impressed with the California landscape (e.g. Coolies Caribbean restaurant)."
5,Remembering the Times,"I'm a tall, big-foot girl, and I've been called sassy more than once in my lifetime. I loved the story, the characters were depicted truthfully...not too much of the ""fairy"" tale princess stuff that too many stories of this nature portray. The children in the story are sometimes ""mean-spirited,"" however, the point of the story is to show how an individual can learn to cope and overcome criticism. The Uncle Red character is right on target, and he helps to save the day, and self-esteem, of Sassy. He reminds Sassy that she is beautiful and gifted. He tells her that as long as she puts her best (big ole) foot forward and tries as best as she can, she will overcome poor self-esteem or criticism from others."
3,Not what i expected...,"MMMMMk, so this book is about a little girl aspiring to be a ballerina. I got it because my daughter is 4 and taking dance classes so i thought a nice ballerina story was in order. Ummm i didn't really like this tho. We don't do name calling and teasing and things like that in our house. It's not acceptable. And even though i understand in the book it was mainly between the character and her brother, some of the comments were still a bit out of order. Especially with the main character and some of her dance counterparts. It is a good story however, a bit too grown for my kid."
1,My kids didn't like this one,My kids 5 and 7 didn't like the characters and thought they were mean to each other so we donated this book to Goodwill.
5,Unfortunate Subtitle,"This book is a must have guide for women in every age. The subtitle ""Natural Menopause revolution"" is not choosen well, as this book really is not only about menopause. It talks about PMT and other health issues women in different stages of their live have to deal with. A book I like to give to friends as a gift, which is always very much appreciated."
5,havent even read it yet...,"i actually bought this book for my wifes birthday. it was an idea from my mom, since she found out how big an animal lover my wife (and I) are. i started to read the first chapter before i wrapped it up, and knew right away it would be a tear jerker. all in all, i bought this book because a portion of the proceeds go to Angels Gate. that is terrific for lots of animals out there, and my wife loved the idea of giving something back. if you even like animals, you should get this book. i pray every day now that more people in the world will follow Susan Marino's idea."
5,Getting Lucky is a 5 star read!,"Getting Lucky is for all of us who share our hearts and lives with our animals. This book will make you laugh and cry, sometimes both at once. Beautifully written, with humor,love and sadness that just pulls at your heart. You won't be able to put it down. Angel's Gate is truly a place where ""Angels"" go to be loved and let go. I dedicate this review to my own angel, Jakob M. who passed on only 1 year ago. I'm grateful that places like Angel's Gate exist and that there are people out there who know just how special these creatures are."
4,"Getting Lucky--a Well Written, Heartwarming Story","Getting Lucky by Susan Marino with Denise Flaim is the heartwarming, and at times heartbreaking story of a dog named Lucky who came to Angel's Gate, the first ever residential hospice and regabilitation center for animals in the world. Lucky was a teacher to all who met him, and was a very special dog. The book also tells the tales of 16 other animals who have passed throught Angel's Gate, all the while telling Lucky's story and the story of Angel's Gate.The book is well written, and suitable for just about all ages. I have no complaints aside from the fact that the vocabulary is a little repetative. It is truely a heartwarming must read!"
5,"Love, hope and miracles.","'Getting Lucky' is a 'feel good' book, which captures the true meaning of unconditional love. Sue and her staff give their all for the residents of Angel's Gate, where numerous species live in harmony. This book is full of wonderful, touching stories and wil make you a believer in the power of hope."
1,Don't buy this book.,"Kenneth Copeland claims that heaven is another planet and that God created this earth to be a copy of it.These ideas are totally alien to the historic Christian faith. From the very beginning of Christian history--in fact, from before the time of Christ in faithful Judaism--the people of God have held to the divinely revealed principle that God made everything that exists (meaning there was no other planet on which he was originally based) and that he created everything out of nothing.Thus the Church today teaches: ""We believe that God needs no pre-existent thing or any help in order to create, nor is creation any sort of necessary emanation from the divine substance. God creates freely 'out of nothing'"""
3,Not Bad For Live I Guess...,"All in all this was Ok, but I for one thought the recording wasn't all that good. Doom's voice comes through fine but the beats are really muffled and kind of blur togeather. If you are a Doom fanatic then pick this up. If you are looking to try him out skip this one and get one of his two studio albums."
4,Don't have them delivered to AZ in the summer...,"These were clearly packaged with care by Hirt's, but it didn't matter. By the time I got home from work they weren't doing so well in the Arizona heat (and I have a shady porch with a delivery guy who never comes in the morning). They seemed like they wanted to hang on, but between the ordeal they endured when shipped, the replanting, etc. they just never 'took' to their new home. The cats loved them while they lasted - but in less than 2 months I went from 8 plants to 0. Next time I order something like this out here I'll know better."
4,THIS PROFESSOR OF SEXPISTOLOGY SAYS...,MY ONLY 2 COMPLAINTS ABOUT IT ARE THE SCHIZOPHRENIC SHORT ATTENTION SPAN CAMERA WORK AND THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE SHOTS OF THE BAND AND LESS OF THE AUDIENCE. WHEN A PISTOLS FAN GOES TO A PISTOLS SHOW THEY WANNA SEE THE BAND...NOT THE CROWD. OTHER THAN THAT THIS DVD IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANYONE STUDYING SEXPISTOLOGY.
1,Region Encoding,"That is sad, very sad you can't buy DVD or B.R discs from other regions.Awful to watch Sex Pistols only at You Tube.Where is the global concept here???"
4,John Lydon is now Johhny Ripe,"John Lydon is now Johhny Ripe! He is not the cocky young angry Johnny Rotten anymore, he is now older and less angry and vocal. But he is still cocky and entertaining. The live performance was pretty good, especially for a 50+ year old man. The interviews he did when he was younger (you can find them online-sex pistols/PIL)were more entertaining to me.If you like the Sex Pistols and can afford the $20, it is worth it to watch the interviews or to have the concert playing in the background while tipping back a few suds with others."
3,Good budget collection of 90's re-recordings,"This is a good budget collection if you want a sampling of Brenda Lee in certain genres. This series includes greatest Gospel, Rock and Country. But just be aware that these are the re-recordings of her hit songs she did back around 1996. She went back in the studio and recorded these with Owen Bradley so she could own some of her recordings. These recordings are very enjoyable but if you are looking for the original MCA/Decca recordings look elsewhere."
2,"Cute book, Misleading Title","To be honest, this book, (although a great premise), does in no way contain the best and worst personal ads of all time, not even close - but more a collection of hundreds of repetitive Victorian era ads, about half a dozen from the twenties, and a whopping 3-4 ads written past the year 2000.If you think you might gain some insight when writing your own ad, don't count on it. This book is just an interesting glimpse at a very distant past, which is fine, but is about as honest a title as your online date showing up at the restaurant after posting pics of themselves a much attractive ten-fifteen years younger. I think you know what I mean.I would rename it: A Collection of Quaint Personals from a Past Era - because that is what this book is."
1,Not sure why this book gets so many stars,"I read an article reviewing this book and was so excited to check it out. When I looked through the book I was dissapointed at how ""light"" it was in content. Deciding to give it a try I read the first 20 pages at least and found the book extremely boring - so boring in fact that I've given up. The ""personal ads"" are not very funny or entertaining, just basic and dry. I honestly don't even want to give it to someone else and will probably end up throwing it away. Don't waste your money."
1,Cool title but lame book.,"Title is cool but all the adds I read before I died of boredom were more than 100 years old. Just couldn't relate to the wording they used back then. If I had paid full retail I would have been pissed, this book isn't worth the cost of shipping."
2,No Good for Tricks,This book is worth getting if your new to magic. It teaches you sleights and forces that you need to know. But the tricks in this book are terrible
4,BANG for the buck!,"Most stores are sold out of these,but They sell for $20 but you can get them for under that and most sellers have them.The problem with Ritz camera(I think they were out of stock) they kept delaying my shipment,they made up for the delay by shipping via fedex.One Man's opinion,Emilio......."
1,didnt receive it,"I never received this item. Apparently the company had a problem with someone hacking into their computer system and tampering with orders. I found this out after multiple emails to the company. However, they stated that customers should receive their merchandise shipping confirmation within 1-2 days. I never received this by the beginning of January, and as this was a Christmas present, I called to cancel the order."
3,Average,"Bought it because it was cheap and capacity was good. Good overall, pages seem a bit loose and shift around more than expected. Nothing amazing, but it works for the right price."
2,eh,"I liked their first production best. I can't make this one work for my yoga classes. The Om Mani Padme Hum is too sinister sounding to my ear. In fact the first time I played this cd to class I wasn't expecting this song, and when it came on with it's long low OM and this tapping or loud clicking sound that is interjected into the chant,I just about popped out of my pose. I turned the music down, apologized and continued teaching without music. Don't get me wrong I love 'yoga music', and I love the om mani padme hum chants. I own many yoga cds and make my own mixes for teaching classes but this cd sits in the back of the collection. It serves as a reminder that I should listen to the whole cd before deciding to play it in class."
3,Looks great.. but runs small,I bought my husband this shirt at the same size his other dress shirts are and it ran very small. Unfortunately I didnt keep the receipt so now I'm stuck with a shirt that's too small.
4,very good quality,"excellent quality, excellent price, and expedient delivery. What else could a person ask for?"
1,Izzue grey shirt,the photo makes it appear solid. it actually has a pattern which everyone in my family of 7 finds hideous. My wife refused to let me wear it and threw it out.
1,Thin,This shirt is just too thin. I'm not real picky with my dress shirts but this shirt is thinner than my under shirt.
2,Not good,"I did not like the texture/material. The fitting was also loose for me. Having used Eddie Bauer cotton shirts, these shirts were disappointment."
4,wonderful Giovanni music and more,This Giovanni concert is filled with non-stop beautiful music in Giovanni's usual style as well as some surprises. The guest musicians are fabulous and their talent adds to the enjoyment of this DVD. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great music and a very entertaining and relaxing listening experience!
1,Acocella is presumptuous,"Ms. Acocella was not happy that I took strong issue with her book; rather than address the substance of my remarks concerning her failure to present a balanced and informed perspective, she decided to disqualify my comments by blaming them on my alleged embarrassment about ISSD. Sorry, I'm not embarrassed; her remarks constitute a form of mind-reading based on what she would LIKE me to say. My words speak for themselves without needing Ms. Acocella to invent motivations for them."
4,A look into therapy's most foolish decades,"Ms. Accocella's ""Creating Hysteria"" would rank with some of Evelyn Waugh's most black-hearted comedies were it a book of fiction. Unfortunately, the frightening and unbelievable (how could anyone believe some of that nonsense?) events are well documented. Bennett Braun's and D. Corydon Hammond's speeches are models of paranoid loopiness. What sets her book apart from other critiques of the MPD/DID movement are the day-to-day behaviors of the therapists and movement leaders, as opposed to the highly stilted language with which their papers and books are written - seemingly, to make them appear ""scientific"". Highly recommended."
5,this is the great oneeee//////,"this is a very great and beutiful bible i love ittttt,, also love the cover,,as soon as arrive i start using it, i recomend it to everyoneout there,,God Bless ,..."
5,Bíblia de Referencia Thompson Piel Especial Negro,"I'm very pleased with my new Spanish Thompson Chain Reference Bible. I looked for one for nearly a year elsewhere (I found a hardbound, but wanted softbound) so I was excited to find it on your site. I'm very happy with it. It is my prized possession and only for $38!"
5,Spanish Thompson Chain Reference Bible,"We received this Bible in perfect condition. I ordered it on line for my son while in Mexico and when we got to our address at Pharr, TX on the border it was there waiting for him."
2,Good for a laugh,"If you like a good laugh at the expense of cheesy techno music, this might be the CD you need to add to your collection. There *are* good songs on this album. Most notably the ever-popular goth club hit Nightmare (Sinister Strings Mix), by Brain Bug. Most of the stuff will bring back memories of going clubbing in the very late 80s, early 90s when this type of music was just emerging, but other than a few other tracks, these really take the bad remix cheese award. Though they *will* make you laugh, especially if you remember hearing them in clubs years ago."
1,Piece of junk!,"This is my third Creative Zen MP3 player. I also have a Zen Nano Plus which still works fine, although it takes AAA batteries (my first player was a Zen Nano with no radio, so I switched to a Nano Plus).The Creative Zen V Plus I bought worked fine at the beginning and then shortly thereafter it started to repeatedly freeze, which requires resetting with a straight pin. After several times of resetting, something broke inside and I can no longer use it (this was within around 4 to 6 months of buying it). I'm now looking for a new MP3 player with a rechargeable battery after wasting $100 on the Zen V Plus (what I paid for it at the time). I give it NO STARS as a rating."
2,"OK, not great","I find it is easy enough to download and create playlists (although once you create a playlist you cannot change it's name). I am disappointed that the Zen crashes so frequently. When it does I have to wait a couple of days for the battery to run completely out of juice. It will then reboot and rebuild it's library. Also there is an FM function with no directions anywhere on how to get it to work. Since it is offered, there should at least be some info in the help index. Why offer it and then totally frustrate the consumer by not making it easily accessible? I would not buy this product again."
4,zens ok,"shipped as thy said, received in good shape, it works fine. clear sound and good functions.Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player (Black/Green)"
3,"Okay, but doesn't bookmark for audio books.","I use my Zen for listening to audio books. Although they transfer and play well, I wish that it had a bookmarking feature. If I stop playing the book to look up something in contacts, I can't easily get back to where I left off in the book. When you fast forward for too long, it freezes and you have to reset with a paper clip."
2,Zen V portable media player,It took so long to arrive and after it did big disappointment the seller never mentioned this product was a REFURBISHED PRODUCT! as soon as i tried it out sure enough it frozed up very disapointing will not recommend at allll
4,Great MP3 Player,"This is a great MP3 player for someone who does not need to keep their entire music library on the player (like me!). It has great sound, menus very easy to navigate & despite the small size, the controls are easy to use as well."
5,Nice MP3 player,"Music: Loud and Clear for regular listenersCapacity: Like 800 songs of 4min plus short videosNice screen resolutionEarplugs are a little big, but sound great.A good choice for anti-IPOD people."
1,Didn't last a year,"I thought this was going to be great. It's light, sleek, I loved all the features. But towards the end, it became a frustrating hassle.Janurary 2007: I received it. Then about two weeks later, the toggle switch that you use to navigate it broke off. For the remainder of the time that I kept it, I had to navigate using my fingernail.Spring 2007: It froze. It's okay, I just reset it.August 2007: It froze. But then when I reset it, it froze during loading.September 2007: Can't skip songs or change volume because it'll freeze.Fall/Winter 2007: Can't reset it when it freezes because it'll just freeze over and over. I had to let it rest overnight and attempt to reset the next day.December 2007: Stopped using it.It WAS awesome. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,No Quality Control,"I had a unit that was bad on purchase. They replaced it, seemed ok until it froze and I to reset it. Guess what? There was no reset button in the reset hole! It cant be reset. This unit froze a couple of times when disconnecting it from USB port, even though no transfers were in progress. It timed out and worked fine, but when it had to be reset, no way!They want $40 to ""fix"" it. Its $25 for ""diagnosis and handling"" and $15 for ""handling"" just to get the RMA! A new one is $74. A new SANSA is also about $80. So why bother paying $40 to get a refurbished one?"
4,Good MP3 Player for everyday use,"If you are looking for a good sound quality MP3 player, there is none. So just get yourself a decent stereo.Pros:small sizeaccept mutiple audio formatsbuilt-in FM radioeasy navigation and controldurablenice screen contrastripping music from CDs and selecting music from your computer is very easyCons:earbuds are bigsome people had problem with the machine freeze up. I had mine for 1 week now, and it works fine."
4,Everything cool except one little thing,"I received this product as a pre-mom's day gift from my husband. I really really love it. It's super tiny and works beautifully. I hate reading manuals and was able to work it right away. I haven't tried the FM radio yet, but everything else is perfect.The only thing I REALLY really hate are the earphones that it comes with. Might be my ears, but after 2 days of using it, I have to use what I already had at home. They really hurt! Had they've been comfortable, would have gotten a perfect 5 stars.Otherwise,like I said, perfect and beautiful."
5,Love it,"I love this player. It was actually smaller than I thought it would be and it is so adorable! The screen is really pretty, even though you can't see it in the sunlight, but you can just shield it with your hands and it's not a problem. I love being able to change the themes and backgrounds for the menus. Learned how to use it really fast. I especially love the search feature to find a particular artist fast or the keyword search for a song. Would highly recommend."
4,Good So Far....,"I had a Creative Muvo N200 that was great until it crapped out - I'm hoping this one lasts longer.So far I'm impressed with the functionality. I researched long and hard to try to find a player that was small, compatible with Audible, compatible with Netplayer, and had bookmarks. This player does it all, and the bookmarks are a necessity for netplayer and audible content.The interface is nice and fairly easy to use. The included earplugs are surprisingly comfy. If it holds up it should be a winner.One dissappointment - I have a Motorola RAZR phone and saw on-line a adapter that claimed to charge both the RAZR and the Zen V. I figured the Motorola version that I have for both plug-in and car would work, but neither do. Chargers are getting too smart for their own good I suppose, so for now I am stuck with the USB charger,which I really don't like...."
1,Don't buy this!,"I bought one of these players in April. I had to repeatedly reset and then reformat the player. Finally in August it died totally. Creative customer service wanted $25 dollars to even look at it with no guarantee that, even if fixed, it would last for any period of time. I strongly suggest that you look for another brand of player."
2,Would not recommend,This small cute device is kind of deceiving. I bought it for my mom and she found it difficult to use. The manuel it came with was not very helpful/useful. It also advertises that it holds up to 1000 songs however this is not true. I could barely fit 300 songs. I would not recommend it.
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This player was awesome... for the 12 days it worked! Then it crashed & even windows wouldn't recognize it. After scouring the internet for a solution I learned this is a common feature of the Zen V Plus. I wish I had know before I gave it to my son as a gift. Even the support team at creative agreed it was time for a new zen... I'm thinking ipod instead. Maybe in the near future Creative Labs will work out the glitches, but I won't be purchasing another of their products soon. It really is too bad because it could be a really cool toy, it's relatively reasonably priced & the software was very easy to work with. If you ignore this, good luck but don't say you weren't warned. If you're determined to own a Zen wait a few months until they can fix the quirks."
1,"SCREEN DEAD AFTER 2 MONTHS, BEWARE!!!","DON'T WASTE YOU TIME OR YOUR MONEY BUY AN IPOD OR A ZUNE! I won't say that this is absolute junk, but now that the screen is dead after only 60 days, it is hard to say much good about it. Because now it is truly worthless. Tried to save a little coin, and you get what you pay for. It appears that the screen is very fragile, and if I had read the reviews from others I would have laid out the extra cash and bought a ZUNE earlier, 20x the product for only 2x the price. Also tried to get the warranty activated from Creative, however they say that a dead screen is not covered by the warranty, only the hard drive. In fact they wanted proof that anything wrong with the device was not caused by me, not sure how to do that, and also was told by the customer sevice rep, ""Why are you wasting my time, they're only $100, buy another."" DON'T WASTE YOU TIME OR YOUR MONEY BUY AN IPOD OR A ZUNE!"
1,Jelbrown,"I purchased two Zen V Plus as Christmas gifts. One the screen does not display and the other freezes often. When the players work like they should it was great but I spent too much money for both products to cause so much trouble within 6 months of purchase. I've tried to firmware updates often and one player will have to be returned for a fee. I would not recommend this product to anyone due to the numerous problems so soon. Based on other reviews, I'm experiencing common problems."
2,Disappointed,I have only had my Zen for about 5 months and it's already freezing up. I have to keep resetting it but to no avail. I think I should have paid exrta money and went with iPod.
4,Nice for the price,Very convenient player at an inexpensive price. I use it mostly for audio books and appreciate both the super fast forward and bookmarks. Instructions for use are noteworthy for the paucity of information. Charging by usb connection is also inconvenient.
1,NEVER RECEIVED PRODUCT FROM SELLER,HAD TO CONTACT AMAZON BECAUSE SELLER NEVER SENT PRODUCT OR RESPONDED TO ANY EMAILS. SELLER SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF AMAZON
3,Works for audio books but has bug-a-boos...,"The Zen is small, convenient, has good sound and has good battery life, that said there are a couple of issues that are rather bothersome... this includes the little joystick that is hard to maneuver and easily can rewind your book to the beginning if you're not careful, freezing can be a problem and the book marking system is cumbersome.The most irritating part, with audio books anyways, is when ever one fast forwards or rewinds, picks a bookmark or starts the device it begins with a shrill screech before the audio program starts where it left off, this hurts ones ears and requires that the headphones be taken off for that moment. I thought that it was defective in regards to this and returned it but the new one did the same thing! Maybe the techies can figure out a software upgrade that will resolve this (ARE YOU GUYS LISTENING?!??)"
4,i don't like ipods...,"So I bought this instead. It's great, the software was simple to install and use. I made the mistake of attaching it to the usb port before I installed the software. The player didn't turn on, but once I reset it with the post of my earring, it worked fine. I ripped all my cd's into it very quickly. The picture viewer is good too. And I love the voice recorder. It sounds about as clear as a computer microphone (an average one at least.) I just wish the instructions said something about how to delete the mp3s I didn't want in it anymore. I finally found out how, but the button I have to hold in is now stuck. That's the only complaint I got. It's really good. Buy it instead of an ipod. This is for people who actually CARE about their music, not what social statice they'll have."
1,This unit is garbage! - Buyer Beware!,"I purchased a Creative Zen in November for my wife for Christmas. She had it for a little more than 90 days when the power switch broke. The unit would no longer turn on. So, I contacted Creative to see if we could get a replacement. They said that since it was beyond the 90 day warranty period that we'd have to pay $25 JUST TO HAVE A SERVICE TECH LOOK AT IT. Then, there would be charges for the repair on top of that. What? The tech was extremely rude via email, accusing me of abusing the product even before giving me the opportunity to explain that my wife was very careful with it, always using a special carry case which I purchased in addition.Bottom line, buy an iPod or something else and save yourself the grief. Creative obviously does not feel confident enough about this product to back it with anything more than a 90 day warranty. They know these units will break because they're garbage!"
1,creative zen v review,"bought as xmas present for my teenage daughter, worked 2 days - then stopped - reloaded software twice, worked 2 days then stopped could not be re-started, very disappointing for a new Creative player to fail in a few days.my refurbished, scratched, dropped several times over apple nano has never failed once, no wonder Apple dominates the market."
1,Screen died after six months,"This was a great product at a great price. I was even able to make it work with windows vista. However, the screen faded and went totally blank after less than six months use and apparently there is no fix. I would not reccomend the Creative Zen V Plus."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"I bought my Creative Zen V Plus to replace another Zen V that was freezing up and not working. I shouldn't have wasted the money on another Zen product. After using the new V Plus the first time, I started having trouble with it freezing up, too. What a pain! I just want to listen to my music without having to reset and reboot every five to ten minutes. And now that I've waited over 30 days to contact the company about returning the product for a refund, it's too late to do so and I'm stuck with both Zens that constantly freeze up.Go ahead a spend the money on an IPod Nano. I just purchased one on EBay for much less than I could in the store...and with Free Shipping. I wish I would have bought the IPod to begin with...a much better buy and ITunes is so easy to work with!!!"
1,Horrible mp3 Player,"DON'T BUY THIS!! Mine froze up after just 2 days. The player didn't respond at all, i couldn't even turn it on. And guess what? You can't contact customer support. You have to send them an e-mail with proof of purchase. Why would you need that for technical difficulties? It's really just a waste. And the sound quality is bad as well."
4,great,"My daughter wanted an IPod for Christmas. I just could not justify the cost. Of course she wanted the blue one which is only available in the 4 gig model. I bought her the 2 gig Zen because I liked the added feature of an FM radio and the cost. I signed up for an Amazon card and got another $30 off.She was disappointed at first but now that she sees she can use the free 30 days of Napster to go and download unlimited songs she is very happy with it. The drop and drag is so easy to use. Now her friends with the IPods are jealous because they have to pay per song.The one negative is the earbuds, they were too big and did not stay in her ears, I even tried it and found they were uncomfortable. We have ordered some gel earbuds and hope that will solve the problem. The sound is great and I love the photo feature!! I wish it could also play games."
2,Not Reliable,"When the Zen V Plus works, it's great, but mine has gone into a coma twice since I purchased it in January 2008. Both times, pushing the reset button didn't turn it back on. Trying to charge it didn't help either. The first time it died, I was ready to return it under warranty, but after a couple days it ""woke up"" (on its own) and worked fine. It just quit working again, a few days ago, and won't come out of its coma this time. I was going to return it, but found out my labor warranty expired (after 90 days) and I have to pay $25, in addition to shipping the damned thing back and insuring it. I'm not sure if it's worth paying this to get a replacement that might give me the same problems!"
5,Great player!,"I bought this player a few months ago and I use it all day, every day at work. I haven't had any of the problems that others have mentioned. It's great for listening to both music and audiobooks. I don't know that you would want to watch much video on the small screen but if you want it mainly for audio it's perfect. It has good sound quality and a fairly long lasting battery."
4,rugged and easy to use,"I am writing this review a couple of years after purchasing this product because it just went through the wash and after leaving it to dry a couple of days, I plugged it into my computer to recharge and guess what, the darn thing works perfectly. A good reason to go for Flash based memory over a mini drive!!!I started off using this mp3 player and then handed it off to my husband as I like to have audio books & music on mine and the 2gb is not quite enough to do both IMHO. We have both loved it for its ease of use.The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because you cannot charge it on a regular wall plug or car outlet, you have to plug it into a computer which is sometimes inconvenient."
2,One down one to go,"I have purchased two of these units, for my both of my twin daughters 2006 christmas gifts.One unit's display does not light anymore. However it still play music, but navigation is difficult since you can't see where you are on the main display.Since it's just out of the 90 day labor warranty, I'll have to pay a non-refundable handling fee of $25.00 when I return the unit for repair. I have my RMA # from Creative lab, and I'll see how it goes when I return the unit. I hoping they're not going to ask for more money for a $109 unit. More than $50.00, I don't feel it's practical.It is a disappointment, since the unit was used lightly and already needs repair after less than 4 months of ownership. Oh well, I'm glad it's not a $350 IPOD, which I had problems with them tooCreative's customer service was prompt, replies within 12-24 hrs. My other daughter's identical unit is still going, no problems."
1,"ya, don't buy this","pretty sure this looks and acts good out of the box, but really it sucks. it has descent audio playback, but nothing compared to the archos or ipod. as is similar in *ALL* creative products they don't last more than a couple of months. i think the one had worked for about two and then the screen and audio playback go out. same with one of my friends that bought the same product. on the plus side, it has a really cool EQ system if you're into that. but, for the money the best MP3 you could get out their is the archos or ipod nano. Conclusion: THIS PRODUCT BLOWS"
4,"Useful, but no style and pricey","I have this unit (in white), but have replaced it with a 4th Gen Nano (primarily for its larger capacity). While the Zen is a good introduction to portable audio, the price has gone up considerably since I got mine a year ago. If you find you like the device, you will soon want something that can hold more songs.Pros:Small, fairly sturdy (plastic housing is ugly, but that means you won't obsess over dents and scratches)FM Radio is a plusSongs added by basic file management (not I Tunes) and can be copied off machine (unlike I Pods)Controls work with gloves on (unlike I Pod, which requires skin touch)Cons:Thick body, and not attractive or stylishScreen is small and not very crisp--barely usable for videoControls--basically a mini-joystick--are a bit clunky2 GB capacity is very small, and costs $45 per GB, versus about $18 per GB for a 8 GB Nano."
4,Great MP3,This player is excellent for the price. However I do not like the battery life. It is very limited for my use. The battery is great for simple applications.
2,Crippled by Play For Sure,"This player is pretty good all around. Would be an excellent player if it were not crippled by Play for Sure compatibility, a format no longer supported by Microsoft. If you do not have WinXP or Vista do not get this player, the hassle involved in actually getting the player to work is not worth it."
4,Great little product,"I am using this for audio books downloaded from a public library site & it works great. Took a while to get used to it because the manual is VERY slim on info, but once I knew how to UNFREEZE it(use a sharp pin in the little hole) it is fine.BTW, the only time it has frozen is when I have tried to fast forward for extended time or been jumping around through lots of menu commands."
2,"Houston, we have a problem...","I bought two of these for Christmas, and one would not charge at all, so I had to send it back. Looking at the various discussion boards, this seems to be a common problem. The other one charges OK, but only on the computer. It doesn't like the cheap USB charger I bought, even though my iPod works fine with it.This product has a lot of great features, and I hope that we get to enjoy them without any further problems. I would recommend charging this product before giving it to someone as a gift. Then, if it doesn't charge, you can send it back before disappointing someone."
2,its dead,"my zen finally went ka ptt ,bought it this summer,first the screen went dark, a common problem it seems. I could deal with it i just had to learn to navigate with no screen ,but then it started freezin up, the buttons wouldnt work, i would have to turn it off then on again for it to work.Now today i`ve had to reset it several times and now its really froze, wont turn off, no sound no screen, and my pc isnt recognizing the device. NO THANK YOU, enough, finish ,,bye bye zen.. all i can say is do some research before spending your hard earned dough,,which is why im here lookin for a new mp3 player."
1,Creative Zen V Plus 2 GB Portable Media Player,Difficult to install and fill with music. Locked up after two weeks of use and had to be returned for repair. Awaiting return. Better luck with SanDisk.
4,Nice Player,"We purchased this for our 12 year old who was asking for an ipod. We were afraid he would lose or break the ipod and did not want to pay its hefty price tag. This zen is not as ""heavy"" feeling in your hands as an ipod is, but I really like it. My son loves it - it was easy to use, easy to transfer music to, and just fun."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could,"I have had my player for less than 24hr. I got the software installed, tranfered music and let it charge. It won't turn on. I have not even been able to get it to work for an instant.Good luck trying to get support. The website says to check the manual for the local number. The manual says to check the CD. The Cd has no support number."
1,Zen V Plus MP3 Players,"I would like to be able to write a review on the MP3 player but I've never been able to install it on my computer. I have contacted Creative Customer Service email at least 4 times - spoke to a representative on the phone once - sent the unit back to Creative for their examination and received a new (or rebuilt) unit that I'm still not able to install on my computer. I continue to get error messages when I try to install it. Unfortunately, I bought the player from Amazon so Creative cannot give me a refund and Amazon requires it to be returned in its original packaging (of course the original packaging is a sealed plastic container that you have to open with a knife or scissors). I'm not sure if the Creative ZEN V Plus MP3 player is good or not since I've never been able to install it."
3,ZenV,"I have only 2 gripes about this product: 1. battery life. I use the ""smart volume"" feature which apparently will drain the battery twice as fast. I currently get about 6hours of playtime before recharge.2. Having to use a USB plug to charge it. I recently purchased via EBAY a wall charger but it didn't work at all. I see that Creative Labs has one but it's not available yet.Other than these 2 things I really like this player. I didn't even try the earbuds that came with it. I already had a new set of Shure EQC's to use."
1,Not so good,I got this little guy and it just wouldn't work. I tryed to get it to work with two different computers and it never worked. I suggest that you spend the money and just get a I-pod. These cheaper MP3 players have no garuntee that they will even work.
4,Zen Stone Plus,The Zen Stone is so easy to use. I rip music I am learning for choir and don't have to keep up with multiple discs. Very easy to use. Also enjoy using the FM radio. Easy to recharge battery. Very pleased with purchase.
3,Not for audible books,"This MP3 player sounds great, but I would not recommend for use with audible books. It does not have a bookmark feature, so everytime you turn off or pause the book, you need to search again for where you left off.If I were to do it again, I would probably go for another player."
3,Not perfect for audiobooks,"I have been on a lengthy search for a player that is easy to use for people who listen to audiobooks instead of music. Most players barely address audiobooks, including Creative Zen. I knew Creative was compatible with library downloads (not all players are) so I bought this one. It is small and does work. But the books are downloaded into different locations (my library downloads go one place and audible goes another) and are difficult to retrieve. The Help function is useless. But once I download a book and am able to find it, I love the player."
1,Zen V not worth your time,"I bought the Zen V, it was great for about a month, then it started freezing, the screen began to turn red with lines in it, then completely black. Though it still played music, i could see nothing, i had to remember where the menus were. Then, after a while of continued freezing and the headphones breaking, it stopped playing completely. I plead with you, don't buy the Zen V"
1,I wouldn't buy this if I were you,"I've bought it when it was only available through amazon. It freezes all the time, Joystick button broke after a week usage, It charges in 6 hours from USB, it is not compatible with ordinary USB-wall chargers, you need to buy a charger with USB sync. Its sound quality is quite good, screen is also great but I wouldn't buy it if I were you, go for a better and more robust alternative..."
2,Product freezes then the reset button broke,"This product freezes a lot....then one time when I tried to reset it I pushed the reset button with no real force and the button broke....so I had to let the battery completely die so it would power off then recharge it so that I could use it again. When I called the Creative Zen because I was still in my 90 day warranty they told me that it would take up to 5 weeks to take the whole thing apart and erase all of the subscription music that I would have to pay for again to get back on there see if it was my fault or a faulty part. I didn't even mess with it. I was not very impressed with this product, which surprised me because I heard that Creative was a very good name in mp3 players."
3,Not that great,"The screen can not be read in sunlight.File transfer is really quite slow, maybe 2 minute per album.The transfer software is buggy and prone to lock up.As noted in some of the positive reviews there are some good qualities for the MP3 player but those are mostly aesthetic. These manufactures need to engineer a working product first then put on the lipstick."
5,Childhood Memories,This album is one we used to listen to on the way to my grandparents for Christmas. It brings back some great memories!
4,solid entertainment,"Greene just can't be less than substantial, even when he's writing an early noir crime thriller. The depth of insight -- both spiritual and psychological -- is impressive, even by the standards of later Greene novels. His characters are real, the story unfolds with only a minimum of coincidences, the action is gritty and satisfying and unpredictable, and a rich sense of underlying humanity pervades the work. As always with Greene, compassion -- the fierce volcanic eruptions of pity in unexpected peoples and places -- is a major theme. And as usual, a subtle Catholic sensibility is at work throughout, making relevant to 20th-century man a few of the Faith's most central tenets.Good, though sometimes grim, fun. Picture Peter Lorre in the Raven role, and Sidney Greenstreet in the Chumley part, and Hitchcock overseeing it all, and you get some idea, perhaps, of what Greene had in mind. Highly recommended."
3,Fun but lightweight in comparison to his other work,An early Graham Greene novel that is entertaining if a little light-weight. The happy ending is at odds with Greene's later 'no win' scenarios.
2,Not What I'd Hoped For,"Given the world-class reputation of the author, I assumed I was in for a treat -- or at least a solidly diverting yarn. Unfortunately I found myself aching to put this book down and pick up something else. The story is about an assassin working for munitions suppliers who kills an influential British anti-war figure in the days leading up to WWII. He is betrayed and races to confront his betrayers before the police catch up with him. Sounds like good stuff, but for some reason it isn't. Part of the problem is that Greene gets sidetracked into painting little portraits of every peripheral character encountered. While well-fleshed out characters are required ingredients for any good story, Greene goes overboard and the story drags and suffers as a result. Next time I'll try one of his more famous books."
5,Pyramex Zone II Safety Eyewear,"These Pyramex Zone II safety glasses are really decent for the price. I ordered a couple of pairs of these in ""Matte Black"" from Amazon by mistake thinking they were the SAS Stingers that I usually wear, but I do actually like them and have been wearing them both on the job and around the house when working outside. They do a good job of reducing glare and are comfortable enough to wear all day with no digging into the bridge of my nose or pinching behind the ears. Overall, I think they are very good safety glasses for everyday use and have no problem recommending them."
5,Good cycling glasses,"I bought these because I don't like spending $75 or more for designer sunglasses for running and cycling, since I'm liable to lose/break them within a few months anyhow. $15 or less is more my price range. Plus, I get the added benefit of actual eye protection, in case a rock flies up and hits me in the face (it's actually happened--I was very glad that I was wearing safety glasses for that ride! It wasn't this specific pair, but it was another pair by Pyramex. I heard a clicking/cracking noise and felt an impact, but when I stopped to see if there was damage, there was a tiny, barely perceptible scratch. Didn't affect use of the glasses at all). This pair is also nice because the lenses aren't quite as huge as in some safety glasses, so you don't end up looking like a space alien. Highly recommended!"
1,You'll Need a Magnifying Glass to See the Stones,"The Peridots in this necklace are so small and so pale, and so dominated by the comparatively bulky settings, that they can't be seen at all from more than 6"" away. From any normal distance, such as standing next to someone, this simply looks like a nondescript silver chain with no stones at all, and is not especially flattering. In intense light, such as a spotlight or direct sun, it can look glittery, but one still can't see the stones, and there is no discernible color from more than a few inches away. What a disappointment: I returned it."
1,very disappointing!,"This necklace was pretty enough when I took it out of the box, but it doesn't sit right on your neck. The stones turn and point down towards the ground, so all everyone sees is the side of the silver setting. Very disappointing purchase."
2,"this product is not a ""sports"" cd player","I needed a new sports cd player to use while running, so I bought this Philips cd/mp3 player. While I enjoyed the fact that it played mp3s and was relatively inexpensive, I was very disappointed with the product as a whole.The magnetic parts that attach to your shirt to keep the headphone cord out of the way are very annoying and heavy. When running with this cd player, I felt like I was weighed down. I would rather have the headphone cord flapping around than have heavy magnets hitting against me.Furthermore, the remote on the headphone cord is completely useless. The cd player comes with a sporty case to make the cd player easy to hold while exercising, but this means that your hand is not free to use the remote - so the remote just bangs against you and weighs you down as you run.And finally, this cd player ate through batteries and was both heavier and larger than most other cd players on the market."
1,Defective Item,"I was quite dissapointed in this item after opening up the box. The design is great and I was SO excited to have purchased this after hearing so much buzz and seeing the product displyed. But, when I turned it on, the LCD display did not work at all. The CD played fine (both audio CD's and CD's containing MP3 files). But, you had no idea what you were doing when you were pressing buttons. Also, it looks like the magnets had a tendency to cause the CD to jump to different tracks when it got too close to the unit.I tried calling the Philips help line to see what the problem could be, but I couldn't even get through on the 1-800 number included in the packaging. So, I'm returning it today and asking for a refund.Maybe I'll look into the iPod instead."
4,happy,"I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, I have had mine for about 9 years and it still works fine. Don't have the original headphones/earphones with the built in remote anymore because the wire did eventually break after a few years and dropping it many times. only issue I ever really had with this thing was that song names that are too long or have certain symbols in them wont load. it skips them as if its a bad file. so 9 years of being abused and traveling all over the USA with me - yeah I'm happy."
5,Little River Band Greatest Hits,"I'm a very big fan of the band Little River Band there CD the Greatest Hits is an excellent CD to own if your a fan,all the songs are cool they sound great."
4,"""Take it easy on me ?""","I used to own the original CD of this and all of the songs were great. I was recently looking through itunes and found this expanded remastered version and downloaded the entire album. Well, it has been about a month since I did that and unfortunately, I had only assumed that all the songs would be the same. Today, I listened to the songs on my ipod and when ""Take it easy on me"" came on, I couldn't believe my ears. Who is this clown trying to remake the original classic? He sounds awful with his hanging on notes, etc. to make the song his own I guess. I imagined some American Idol performer trying to sing the song when I heard it. AWFUL with a capital A! I don't know who that was that said this was the original because they owned the original LP. Clean out your ears! That was probably one of my favorite LRB songs so imagine my disappointment. Anyway, I deducted a star on my rating because of this."
3,some good tracks,"This cd has some good tracks but isn't really the best of Little River Band.What turned me on to LRB were the fabulous long tracks like the 7 minute versions of ""long way there"",""another runway"" and ""light of day"",the last two featuring Beeb Birtles on lead.I look forward to a day when these brilliant tracks will be back on an album,or even the release of the never- released-in-America version of the ""After Hours"" Australian album.This,their best album,was released in America in a butchered version as the American company deemed it ""not commercial enough"" for American release.Big mistake."
3,What happened here?,"I just bought this cd and some of the things really surprised me. First, I was hoping for the full 8:40 version of It's A Long Way There but that didn't happen. Then as I was listening I found that Take It Easy On Me isn't the original version! I don't know who the lead singer is on that track. Also It's Not A Wonder is not the live verion that was released as a single but the studio version. And finally, Man On Your Mind is totally remixed with horns. Not being a faithful LRB fan these were the only changes I noticed. Maybe some bigger fans can pick out some other variances."
1,Not the REAL hits,"The bottom line is a ""Hits"" collection should be actual recordings of the songs the way they were presented when they rose to popularity on the charts. Who wants to hear a re-worked version without the original vocalist?Just for an example: As much as most people love Paul McCartney you all know there would be a ""revolution"" if he went back and re-recorded the Beatles stuff replacing John and George's vocal tracks with his own, releasing it as a ""Beatles Greatest Hits"" CD.I was so disappointed with the re-worked ""Take It Easy On Me"" that I plan to just get a copy of the original album that it was on. Just my 2 cents."
3,"Close, but no cigar!","I was very excited when I first discovered this collection in the store. When I first played it, I noticed how great the 24-bit digital remastering sounded. In the 70's, I really loved Cool Change, The Night Owls, Lady, and my favorite was Take It Easy One Me. When ""Take It Easy On Me"" came on, I was really disappointed to hear that it was a ""live"" version of the song, and not the ORIGINAL studio recording. I immediately searched the liner notes, but there was no indication that this recording should be anything but the original. I feel that this was false advertising. I did not get what I thought I was purchasing. The first greatest hits featured the ORIGINAL recording, so why is it not here? Sure, the rest of it is good, but it is my FAVORITE LRB song!! What's the deal guys? I want my money back."
1,Idiots running the music business,"This is a great example of what the music business has become, and the losers that make stupid decisions like cutting short the wonderful guitar solos in ""It's a Long Way There"". I will be pursuing getting my money back. What I want to know is WHO IS THE LOSER THAT MADE THAT CALL ??"
3,A Poluted Little River,"This CD has all the great music of the Little River Band and on this I can't complain. The Remastering on the other hand is a different story. The sound is harsh and over the top loud. Some remastering makes for a better sound, if done right. Unfortunatly, most of the time, louder is not better, and overly bright highs make for fast listening fatigue. If you can find a copy of this CD without the remastering, I recommend it. If not, KEEP OUT, SOUND POLUTION ALERT."
4,REMEMBERING OLDER TIMES,"For reasons I can't explain I love this album. Its not musiclly complex and basiclly a mellow rock album. I remember all of it from the 70's when I was young and first getting into music. I perticularly love lonesome loser, happy anniversary, and cool change. Late 70's pop rock at its finest."
1,Steer clear,"If you thought the original 'Little River Band' album was a strong opener from a new rock band and marked a stand against the oncoming drone of disco in the 70's, steer clear of this album. I lost track of this band after their first couple of albums. This compilation demonstrates that some bands will alter their music to stay commercial whatever the cost. Following their legitimate hit of 'It's a Long Way There' and facing the disco onslaught, LRB molded their songs into generally forgettable middle of road odes to love and even bordered on being termed a disco band. And don't buy it for a remastered 'It's a Long Way There'; the version on the CD is some truncated short version."
1,They ruined it!,I can't believe it. What was once one of the greatest extended medleys of all time (It's a Long Way There) is clipped out and the song is cut short. The intent must have been to sell FEWER COPIES! Who is the idiot that decided to do that?!?!?
5,Little River Band Greatest Hits 1982,"I would like to state that my review is for the original 1982, 12 song release of Little River Band's Greatest Hits, not the 2000 remaster with 6 added tracks.Little River Band's greatest hits collects 12 of LRB's best known songs, and biggest radio hits. Hits like Reminiscing, The Other Guy, Lonesome Loser, Help is on It's Way, and Cool Change are all here, as well as some equally good, but lesser known songs. Little River Band's greatest hits does an excellent job of collecting all of the songs, that the casual fan will want. None of Little River Band's big hits is omitted. This is a great CD to add to your collection of classic rock.Here is the song list for the Non-remaster versionIt's A Long Way ThereHelp is on Its WayReminiscingMan on YOur MindThe Other GuyThe Night OwlsLonesome LoserTake it Easy on MeDown on the BorderHappy AniversaryLadyCool Change"
3,Wrong version of Take It Easy On Me,"A previous reviewer stated that he/she received a CD that had the correct version of Take It Easy On Me. I wish I had received one of those CDs. I got the messed with version and let me tell you it's bad. this is 8/25/08. If I were you, I'd expect the same disapointing version."
5,Contains six stories,The book contains a preface and six stories. The Last Castle won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. The contents of the book are as follows:- Preface to the Collection- Abercrombie Station- The Last Castle- The Moon Moth- Rumfuddle- Sail 25- Ullward's Retreat
5,Tropical Dream,"If you don't have the time for a vacation, put it up in your office and vacation for a few minutes each day with this poster. It will take you places you have never been."
5,WOW!,"By far my favorite reggae CD out there. From ""No lollipop no sweet so"" to ""words of the ghetto"" this CD never stops bring the songs that you cant help but skip back to"
4,has done fine,"Bought this for my girl scout daughter. It has been a nice camping tool. Very light, insulates well, and it's damp proof. Decent padding for her, but might be a little thin for my larger body, but would still help keep me warm and dry. We take it to sit on for fireworks and such too."
4,The Missing Chapter by Robert Goldsborough,A very nice little book and a nice imitation of Rex Stout. The story line is an ironic play on itself.
4,As good as Rex Stout,"Enjoyed this just as much as Rex Stout's original stories. The characters are true to form and their parlance is what we've come to expect. There are even the traditional vocabulary builders scattered here and there. It took a short while to become used to Archie preparing documents on a PC instead of a typewriter, but I guess that's the price we pay for progress. The plot of this story includes a nice twist with the deceased as an author who writes sequels to a popular series of detective stores after the original author has died.I thought that Robert Goldsborough did an excellent job of occasionally giving us a round up of who may have done what where and to whom, without making it too contrived."
3,Misleading information from Amazon,"There's a little false advertising or at least misleading information here...says published in 2012, but it was actually published about 20 years earlier. Congratulations Amazon, you got me to buy a Kindle version of a book I already owned. I have a list of books I own, but this one was inadvertently left off, so when I checked the list I thought, great a new Goldsborough book.I'll leave it to others to write an actual review of the book. It's been over ten years since I read it, but all the continuation books are OK; none match the Rex Stout originals."
3,Oh Nero,"This is not Rex Stout, clearly but not just in name. The characterizations are lacking but the plot is good."
3,Liked but not loved.,"I fell in love with the characters of this novel, but did not like the ending so much. The twists and turns the hero and heroine take together, and their very attraction to one another is very definite. Who doesn't love an ""outlaw""? Every girl has their dreams of a bad boy, even if he isn't bad at all, just a version of it, and Billy Darling is that man. The entire time I was reading the book, I wanted to just...give him a hug.And I felt for the heroine, I really did. The guilt, the love, the sacrifices; I lived every emotion and cried every tear. Although I think some parts of the book could've been written better, it is not the emotion of the characters or the way the book is written, just a different journey that the heroine could've partaken."
3,Very Good,"Since I bad-mouthed one of her other books, I wanted to make sure I was honest to give raves to her others. This is the third one I have read by her and though I didn't enjoy it as much as Charming the Prince, this one was very good. I enjoyed the hero and heroine and crazy supporting characters. I would definitely recommend this one."
5,Better than expected,"Okay, so I've never been much for westerns. John Wayne never exactly excited me. So I was a bit trepidatious at first in reading this novel -- in spite of the fact that I love Teresa Medeiros so avidly. I was still afraid she'd disappoint.Well, I was wrong -- thank goodness -- she did NOT disappoint! Quite the contrary, I found that this book went right up among my other very-favorites of Medeiros. I read it twice in the same day -- after reading it the first time, I was so gleeful at how good it was that I just flipped back to the beginning and started up again.Medeiros certainly knows how to write a good romance that warms the heart and tickles the romantic nerves. The characters were lovable, the plot fun and enjoyable, and the romance solid and believable. And there were some scenes -- I will include no spoilers, but I loved how it ended! -- that just made me giggle with giddiness.If you love romance, read it! (Even if you can't stand westerns. *wink*)"
5,A Funny and Endearing Read,"This one will be well-remembered. I probably took longer to read this book than I ever have any book, savoring the humor and touching scenes within. It's a book whose characters move swiftly to take up residence in your heart to stay. It would make a terrific movie!"
3,NOT AS GOOD AS I'D HEARD,"THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE has sat on my shelf for more years that I care to admit. I kept hearing what a wonderful little book it is, a must read for writers. Unfortunately for me that wasn't the case. On the most part I was lost. I couldn't really grasp the concepts. But what I did get out of it was worth the read. For the price and the number of pages, I recommend it to all who write."
3,Language Changes,I found many things that the authors advised against to be quite acceptable in today's formal writing.
3,read this if you like to read about grammar and style,"This book is a good book if you like to read about styles of writing and grammar. Me-i thought it was okay, but my old english teacher loves this book. I don't think teens would be interested in this book, and I think older people would like it better. Maybe it is me, but i thought it is quite boring, but very informative. Maybe i just get bored easily -i don't know. In other words, if you are doing poorly in English class and are desperate for some help, read this. It will help alot."
4,Writing wisdom in a little book,"I gave this book 4 stars only because it doesn't include practice exercises, to reinforce what I learned. Grammar and writing style are discussed with wit and brevity.I'd love to hear what the original author would say about current pop jargon: ""even as we speak"", ""like"", ""first off"" and so on."
3,Non Fiction,"An oftimes useful guide to help with writing, and how to do it correctly, and formally. Given that this is pretty old some of the usage and advice is archaic and can be ignored because of that, but other general advice and information is quite good.Well worth a look for writers, journalists, or those that have essays etc. inflicted on them as assignments."
3,A useful tool when used wisely,"After 80 years, Elements of Style is still unmatched for breadth and brevity. Often witty, sometimes maddeningly archaic, it's a must for any student but of limited use for the professional writer."
5,A Pleasure,English is the most fascinating of languages. A mixture of all languages and cultures with which it has contact. No wonder it is difficult to manage.This book helps
3,Feebleminded worship of the outdated guide,"Strunk and White are indeed authoritative--and have been for several decades. Let's get over them. They are far too conservative for most writing today (who still insists on saying ""I shall"" and ""the data are""?). Succumb not to the peer pressure of those who would have you utilize this brief tome. Be a free thinker, and write as you might, not as you ought. If you need to understand language per se, try Stephen Pinker's _The Language Instinct_, also for sale at this Web site. If you need a refresher course in grammar, try your old eighth-grade grammar textbook. If you need a style guide, try the _MLA_ or the _Chicago Manual of Style_. If you think you need a rhetoric, learn Ancient Greek and peruse the rhetorikoi of the true masters."
3,Anh...,"OK. So this is one of the definitive reference books on style in written English. Just don't confuse style with grammar--if you want to understand grammar per se, this isn't the book for you. (Steven Pinker's ""The Language Instinct"" is what you want--quite a bit wittier than Strunk & White, too.) ""The Chicago Manual of Style"" or ""Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age"" are both for sale at Amazon, too, and I think they're ultimately better references. But if you want to write well, well, buy Strunk & White, and abide by their oft-archaic but always lucid guidelines. Just, please, don't stop with them. The most-acclaimed writers in the English language conform not closely to Strunk & White's principles (cf. Shakespeare, Jefferson, Longfellow, Hemmingway, Pynchon, Morrison... whatever your taste may be), so be mindful that this book is not alone the key to becoming a great writer."
4,Useful Today,"This book was written sometime ago, yet the simplicity is appreciated and the writing styles and tips can be applied today."
5,Required Reference Book for Any Writer,"If you are a writer in any way, shape, or form - business and personal letters, student, journalist, author, screenwriter - this book is a must-have. The answer to every question regarding formatting and style are readily at your fingertips, written in straightforward and concise language. Writers have been using this book as a mainstay in their reference libraries since the release of the first edition back in 1959."
5,work great,Easy to put on the chairs-just the correct size. Look much better than the white crutch tips that I had used before.
5,Excellent!,"Without a doubt an excellent book for a novice, and informational for an expert. Timothy Albee takes you by the hand and guides you through his process of rigging, pointing out pitfalls and alternate routes along the way.Then he delves into various animation exercises to get you in shape!A great addition to any animator's library."
5,Another supeb tenor.,We can be thankful that the old guard of the opera stage has been replaced by a trio of youthful artists. Villazon along with Calleja and Florez makes a great addition to the world of opera.
2,"Better than Bocelli, yes, but...?","Oh come now! Villazon is a perfectly okay, acceptable lyric tenor no better or worse than many another lyric tenor. He is NOT in any way, shape or form a ""young Domingo"" or ""the fourth tenor"" and to suggest so -- while it may thrill his record company -- is ludicrous. As for his alleged ""whopping high c's"" all I can say is that I didn't hear them. If you want to hear what a ""whopping high c"" really sounds like, listen to Mario del Monaco or Carlo Bergonzi singing ""Che gelida manina"" from ""La boheme"" and you'll instantly hear the difference. Villazon's high c is a bit strained and totally unimpressive to any discerning ear. Is it the voice all these people are crazy about, or the music. I believe Villazon's obsessive fans, like Bocelli's, tend to be newcomers to opera whose limited knowledge gives them little to compare him with. Sure, he's a better opera singer than Andrea Bocelli -- but ""a young Domingo."" Surely these people jest!"
1,poor quality,"I order regularly from Amazon...especially books...we ordered 2 of these Bibles and they have already come unstitched. Very poor quality. Often I order used, but these were new. It could have been a fluke if one of them was bad...but both Bibles came apart...ugh!"
2,A real dog,"I just couldn't make it through this one. Terrible story, poor writing (no imagination) on the author's part. I loved ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Scar;ett"" was just OK, ""Rhett's People"" so-so. This one is trading on GWTW names only. Save your $"
3,In Search of Rhett Butler,"Excellent writing, however, it is a book written by a female, about a female, for females. The ladies will enjoy it,"
5,Very good quality and fast delivery.,The book was in very good condition and the delivery was prompt and fast. I would without a doubt recommend this seller to any one.
1,Frustratingly Overwraught,"I was curious about this book given the extremes of the reviews, but having struggled through its pretensions I must add my vote to the ""too self conscious"" and ""trying too hard"" set. If you want well written gritty and convincing stories, read William Vollman or Irvine Welsh."
5,Starblazers Rocks!,"If you ever watched this series, then you were hooked! I am now 32 years old and still can't get enough. This, and a couple of the other Yamato sound track albums are great.. I have the 3 series on dvd now, and have loved diving back into this series. The sound track kicks butt! I listen to it at work all the time. A must have for all fans! This sound track gives you the feel it was made for a movie hit like Star Wars, very professional, not some cheap dumb sounding tunes that was whipped together. Being stationed in Japan, I recieve a lot of ooos, and ahhhs, when a Japanese National walks by my office and hears it."
5,This is Marketing Machinery that works!,I run a Seattle advertising agency and have some knowledge of this topic. This book is very thorough and thought provoking and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to improve the overall effectiveness of their business to business marketing programs. The book is easy to read and has lots of illustrations that make difficult concepts easy to understand.
2,This is not worth the money.,"Lucy Lawless barely is even shown in these short films. You can definatley tell it's low buget. During the whole viewing I sat there with a ""WHAT IS THIS"" look. I like Lucy Lawless but I think I'll stick with Xena. Dont buy save your money."
3,"Great, but for the price...","For any Lucy Lawless fan, or GLBT drama fan, ""Peach"" is a must see. Short, but artistic, it is worth seeing. For the price, however . . . I guess it depends on your fandom-ness. My friend bought it about four years ago. We were both obsessive Xena fans, and were both coming out of the closet, but I guess she was slightly more obsessive in both areas. Great video, but I wouldn't pay more than 12 bucks for it. Then again, she always called me a cheapskate."
3,Short and Sweet,"I liked Peach. Of course, anything with Lucy in it appeals to me. Yes, it is quite short. And, yes, Lucy has few lines and minimal screentime but, I still found it enjoyable. If you are an avid admirer of Lucy`s work, Peach is a nice little addition to your collection."
4,Magical,"I have to admit that pretty much the only reason i bought this dvd was because it featured Lucy Lawless in a very little-known role.I'm verty glad to say i was pleasantly surprised.Peach is a magnificent, picturesque, quaint and passionate insight into an everyday situation, taken from a very personal perspective. Although short, every second is made to maintain the standard running throughout.A Bitter Song (Lucy Lawless' first film role) is intoxicating. I was unable to tear my eyes away from the powerful childs view of the world, showing so many unique situations in a brand new way that is rarely even thought of.Very highly recommended."
2,"Movie for your brains, not for your eyes","I wanted this movie, i bought it, now i regret it. Not worth that money. This MIGHT be a good movie for people that like to think and analyze about the consept of the motion picture. ""Peach"" is more enjoyable, it catches your attention and you anticipate what comes next. BUT there's no NEXT - movie just ends. I like Lucy Lawless, but i didn't like those movies. Then again - tastes are different..."
1,GOOD TO RENT - LOUSY TO BUY,"Whatever you do, don't buy this new: either buy it used or rent it; it's basically a con job which uses her Xena success to peddle some long-forgotten early appearances. Oh, and there's no sex and no nudity, so don't even think about the so-called ""lesbian"" angle."
1,Not what i had expected,"I have no idea what I just watched, but it was not very good. My friend and I stopped watching after the second film. Horrible!"
3,Its a change,"I am a fan of lucy lawless. Even though the movie was short, I liked the fact that I got to see Lawless in something other than a lether outfit."
4,A classic,"Aside from Enya's other lesser known EPs ('6 Track' and '3 Track'), this one stands alone because of the inclusion of an exclusive Gaelic track (S' fagaim mo bhaile) which could well be one of Enya's best kept secrets (it featured on few collections and is regarded a 'rarity'). It also features 'Ebudae' which we all know from the 'Shepherd Moons' CD.This EP is short, yes, but it makes up in quality what it lacks in length. Enya's lovely voice is worth any price, made more evident when you hear her lovely Gaelic rendition of 'Silent Night'. I consider this the best rendition of the classic holiday song ever, in any language or format."
2,Not all Enya predictably high quality/value,"My personal opinion of the Christmas Ep was not entirely negative. Rarely is every track on a CD outstanding. However, my disapppointments with this CD were the lesser overall quality and the inflated cost for a VERY few minutes of performance. I feel short-changed, to put it nicely.Otherwise, I am a devoted Enya fan."
2,Not a best buy,"Only 5 cuts, total of 16 minutes 45 seconds. One cut is ""The Celts"" available on other CD's. At over a dollar a minute while the music is good, it is very expensive."
3,"I wanted to say something clever in Gaelic, but I don't speak Gaelic.","This is Enya's Christmas CD. It starts off with a beautiful rendition of ""Silent Night"" sung in Gaelic. The rest of the CD is also in Gaelic, other than the last track which is an instrumental. These songs are ok, but they don't seem to have anything to do with Christmas."
3,Good - but much too short,"Although this is a fine CD, especially for the holidays, it is much too short. At 16 minutes you somehow get the impression the artist was only interested in ""cranking"" out a few quick songs. Hmm...maybe she had a little extra shopping to do this year."
1,My Favorite Girl,I had been looking for this CD for years. I went to so many music stores and could never find any of his music. When I was able to find it for the amazing price that I did I could not believe it. The product came quickly and I could not get it out of the plastic fast enough. I listen to it every day. A wonderful product I would recommend for anyone.
4,Beautiful Music n Voice,"DAVE HOLLISTER is just AWESOME! I luv this song. It's got tha bumpin' beats n tha lyrics r juss BOMB!!! N of course, he's got a great voice! I hope he continues bringin' out this music...."
5,Dave Hollister keeps it real,I really like this song b/c He doesn't play around. he keeps it real and makes it sound good at the same time.
1,What the Heck,Ok when i first bought this i was so excited because i'm a big Usher fan and i could not wait to see it. The bad thing about it was when i open the case and but the cd in the dvd player what came on instead of Usher was Pink (the singer). I guess whatever company that made this dvd mixed the cd up. I was to mad. I don't know how they could make this kind of mistake. On the dvd cd it even says Usher big in black but when i put it in the dvd player it's Pink the singer. If you have this dvd please tell me if your usher dvd does the same.
4,kfm,"I first saw Kentucky Fried Movie when I was 17 years old. I am now 51. A friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that I went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. It is made up of little skits that are all funny. Maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch."
5,Brilliant,"This movie is thirty to forty years ahead of its time. If you watch it and ""set it"" you'll know what I mean."
2,"INTERESTING, BUT DATED SKIT COMEDY FILM! HAS BEEN DONE BETTER!","I picked this up in a bargain bin recently and just had to see it. I remembered the film trailer as a teen and thought it would be funnier. This isn't the first film of this kind and certainly not the best. It's a hodge podge of good and bad skits ranging from pretty funny to total bomb! It's interesting for notalgia but, it's not all that good. I would check it out on cable or buy it for no more than a couple of bucks! The DVD transfer is good, but the original source material is not great to begin with."
4,Big Laughs - Great Comedy DVD,"Excellent comedy sketches; I had seen KFM a long time ago, and was happy to see it out on DVD. The Zuckers, Abrahams, and Landis delivered a hilarious, raunchy, side-splitting series of sketch comedy, and I can see where the Airplane movies etc followed. Highly recommended!"
3,Stupid & uneven but VERY funny at times,"The Zuckers and Abrahams honed their craft with this movie, and it shows. Not non-stop joke & gag assault that audiences got in ""Airplane!"" is in evidence here, but one can tell that it is definitely a work in progress. The gags can be really stupid at times, not to mention crass & vulgar. Yet the totally unashamed presentation of them is somehow redeeming.There are times, such as in ""A Fistfull of Yen"" where the schtick drags on too long and loses momentum, and the viewer is left simply waiting for it to end so that the next sketch can begin. However, there are enough laugh-out-loud moments (like the blind boy in ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble"") to make the movie worthwhile.There are lots of so-called comedies (Adam Sandler comes to mind) that are just simply stupid; then there are comedies that are stupid but still funny enough to make the viewer happy."
5,It started it all.,Love this movie. Its skits influenced so many movies and TV shows that came after it.
3,KFM,"The original introduction to the movie is missing, and that's not a good thing. ""A Fistful Of Yen"" is a true classic and the reason I bought the movie. If anything, buy the movie for ""A Fistful Of Yen."""
4,"Alright, Not Great","Playing a number of obscure online games and belonging to a number of absurdist forums, I've been bombarded with references to Kentucky Fried Movie. I finally decided to buy it to see what the fuss was about, and was not severely disappointed. Many of the jokes fall just short of being funny, but are close enough for an effort grade. The bits that did get a laugh from me were so great as to nearly carry the four star rating on their own. Close to the middle, a parody of pornography turns into pornography, so this movie really isn't appropriate for younger viewers.It has its dull moments, but I would definitely recommend this film to any absurdist, comedy fan, or budding classic movie collector."
4,Some will love this Gross-Out Humor Movie,"The style of this movie makes the intro seem somewhat disjointed. I found the move entertaining and amusing. My brother praised it to the skies. Fans of John Waters will find this movie somewhat tame, but in a similar vein."
4,kentucky fried movie,"great movie if you into the aiplane,police academy,and caveman humer. this is the movie that started it all. very funny and stuff that they did then and cannot do now humor is great no pc what so ever."
2,TASTE LIKE CHICKEN,"I FIRST SAW THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS LIKE 15. THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY APPELAED TO ME THEN WERE THE NAKED CHICKS. THATS THE ONLY THING THAT APPEALS TO ME NOW. ALTHOUGH I DID LIKE 1 OR 2 SCENES, THEY WERE FUNNY. BUT, LIKE ONE REVIEWER SAID ""DATED""."
2,"Not Nearly as Good as ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun""","I thought this would be really funny, because David Zucker, Jim Abrahams and Jerry Zucker brought us ""Airplane!"" and the ""Naked Gun"" movies. But this movie wasn't nearly as good as those. Also, it was directed by John Landis, who directed ""Trading Places"" and ""An American Werewolf in London"", so again you might think this would be a good movie. But it's not.The movie is a series of sketches, which are unrelated to each other. A few of them are good, like the one with ""feel around theater"", but several of them are stupid. And the martial arts spoof lasts fifteen or twenty minutes, when it was barely funny enough to fill up five minutes.It's definitely something to rent, not to buy."
1,Kentucky Fried Movie,"I remember this movie back in the 70's as being much, much funnier. I bought it. I saw it and I will never watch it again. It is in the give away pile"
5,"The sickest, funniest, most disgusting collection of skits","Kentucky Fried Movie is not for the faint at heart. Generally offensive, often raunchy, this movie is a must see for any toilet-humor prone comedy fan. If you liked such comedies as Amazon Women on the Moon, American Pie, Fast Times, etc, you will vomit laughing at Kentucky Fried Movie. The funniest movie I have ever seen. Period."
2,Wow!,"I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in the 70s. Now the humor is so dated, it doesn't even seem funny. The Kung Fu part was awful - if they had left that out, it would've been okay. Sort of put me to sleep."
3,Was a lot more fun when I was younger,"So, I remember this movie being so much fun when it came out. I must have been in high school. I recently bought it so I could watch it again. I wonder if the movie was really that bad in the first place or sadly if old age has made things so much less enjoyable. Silly me, it just isn't funny anymore, except for maybe ""Catholic High School Girls in Trouble""!!! OK, that five minutes alone was worth the price of the whole movie!"
3,Kentucky Fried Movie,"Had this on video , funny funny and funny. Evan Kim is also very good with the martial arts in this movie. One of the original and funniest films I have ever seen."
5,"Funny, Witty",This film has the same bold irreverant humor as Airplane. A really good laugh to anyone with a wry sense of humor.
4,"John Landis' ""Kentucky Fried Movie""","The First Film Outing the Creators Of ""Airplane!"" Is A Brilliant Collection Of Comedy Skits...Directed By John Landis, The Best Bits Involve A Bruce Lee Takeoff, And A Surprise Appearance By Wally And The Beaver...A Must See For All You Cult Comedy Lovers...Starring Evan Kim, Master Bong SooHan, Bill Bixby (The Hulk), And Donald Sutherland..."
1,Not even as funny as Airplane!,"Well lets not mesh words with this review. Basically, i took a dump in a bowl and ate it and i enjoyed that more than watching this movie. It will make you more retarted every time you watch it. There should be a Surgeon General's warning on the case."
4,A Slice of Americana,"When I think about it, KFC couldn't have been too thrilled at the title of this film, but I'm betting it didn't hurt them.Gross-out humor pretty much began to bloom in the 70s, and this film, along with 'Groove Tube', was the equivilent of 'American Pie' and 'There's Something About Mary' combined; hell, the nude scenes seem almost quaint now, as they would cause an uproar in any modern 'R' film.Keep your 'Not Another Teen Movie'. I'll watch the bestSamuel L. Bronkowitz has to offer instead; 'That's Armegeddon'."
2,Miss Leading,"I bought this cd to listen to the Theme song from the TV show Angel, to my surprize I found the music lacking in what I thought would be a great cd with great string compositions. In addition the theme song was not included in this cd."
3,Some good some bad,"The Kill You EP is an earlier Darling Violetta CD that is very different to their later work. Apart from the song Awesome which is a great pop-anthem the rest is more raw and alternative sounding (which may or not be your choice). Personally i think this CD is really only for DV fans, others should get Parlour as its a much more consistent and satisfying offering.I'd give it 3.5 stars if i could."
2,The labels just don't fit!,"While this is a great book to journal your cellar, winery visits, etc., the pages are too small to hold most wine labels. I found that many of the labels I had saved took up almost an entire page which made the book useless. Next time, they need to make the book quite a bit larger."
4,Wine Journal,This is a great gift for the wine lover! Perfect for a wine basket along with some label stickers. Received product rather quickly.
4,Good journal . . . a little big,"Although I do like this journal, it is a little big and the pages look a little outdated. Very nice cover and would look nice as a accent to your home (coffee table book, on top of the wine cabinet, etc . . . )"
4,great purchase for a budding wine connoisseur,I'm having a lot fun filling the pages of my Wine Lover's Journal. It is a great place to enter my comments on the different wines I've been enjoying and to help me remember what I'd like to buy again!
1,Don't order it unless you need it in 2010.,"I ordered this from Amazon as a Christmas present and it still hasn't arrived. It didn't even make it by Valentine's Day. In my open and recent orders it claims it'll ship by the 18th of Feb. It's the 17th today. Also, I placed the order in November of 2008, so either this is a very sought after book, it's made of the Shroud of Turin, or somebody needs a map to distinguish their derriere from their elbow."
2,The title of this video is misleading.,"This video is basically a tour of websites for the person interested in action and adventure webpages. From jet rides, to federal agent training, galapagos islands, volcanic eruptions, to the hubbell telescope and sports cars. I would not call this information secret. I was looking for something more technical i.e. about how the internet works and electronic information. The previous review gives the video a 5 and mentions electronics. I expected something more ""secret"" and electronic. It is about adventure sites on the internet. Originally, this video was broadcast as a series with lots of commercials. The mention of ""this week, next week,"" are left in the video. I wanted to inform high school students. I doubt that I will show it and would love to get my money back."
4,Being An Orphan,"This book is a wonderful book. It explains how hard it is to be, well, kind of an orphan. Its about a fifth grade girl, who's mother just died of a sickness. Her name is Livvy. Since she does not have Dad, she has to be adopted or taken care of by another family. So she gets taken by a lady named Jessie. Although Jessie is very nice, Livvy still is not happy being her daughter. Jessie and her mother own an antique store called The Turnabout Shop. It is a nice little shop that Livvy sometimes likes to go there after school. Livvy does a lot of fun things with Jessie, including getting her ears pierced, but there is a problem, Livvy hates when people call Jessie her mother. Everything goes fine until something terrible happens to the Turnabout Shop. To find out what happens, read this sad but exciting book. I rate this book a four because like I said before, its sad and gives you a taste of being an orphan, and it is exciting."
3,Solomons blues side,"When this CD was released, Solomon Burke had yet to be named into the rock and roll hall of fame, had yet to make his ""comeback"" album Don't Give up on me....and was mostly concentrating on his various business ventures. All that said, he was in excellent voice. Its more of a blues side for Solomon and although a soulful release, I would not recommend this for casual fans....start with his atlantic greatist hits....or his live album. For the hardcore fans like myself, its a fine album, not his best, but a fine record...especially solomon singing ""Candy""....good stuff"
3,Good shows/Title Confussion,"My 5 yr old loves watching these funny old shows. She has a copy of the Beverly Hillbillies Vol. 1 distributed by Intercoastal Studios. After watching it constantly, we really needed a change so I thought I would order her a new series of episodes. (We know all of the lines on our old one.) I, thinking logically, ordered the Beverly Hillbillies Vol. 2. Unfortunately, Amazon does not list the episodes in the discriptions, so when the new DVD arrived it had the very same episodes as our Vol. 1. It seems they are distributed by different companies. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning this DVD, and wait to get another one shipped, not to mention the fact we'll be seeing the same 10 episodes until it arrives."
1,Not what I thought...,"I read a previous review and thought this contained 10 new episodes. It was exactly the same as Volume 1, just in a different order. It doesn't say Volume 2 on the disc case and isn't the same picture as shown in Amazon. Maybe Volume 2 really is what I wanted. But what I received was definitely disappointing. I went to order it again, thinking I just ordered the wrong DVD, but it said I already purchased Volume 2. Maybe Best Buy has the whole set."
3,"Sometimes predictable, but filled with strong ideas","The dark god Cretia beckons, casting his foul shadow over the innocent city of Rhoona... soon after, strange things begin to happen - the Ducal Palace falls into silence, and bizarre proclamations are made that lead the populace to near-revolt. It's up to the adventurers (levels 5-7) to deal with an urban nightmare, an excursion into the manticore-infested wilds, a lost temple in the mountains, and a mad, evil high priest who is invincible and cannot die... an amazingly difficult adventure (levels 7-10 would be fine!), and recommended."
3,Good resource,"Curse of Xanathon like sevral of the old adventures does not work very well on it's own. Like most such modules it is better to use it as a resource for your own stories to flesh it out and give it a bit more flavor. As a resource I found it interesting and useful with lotws of little tidbits and encounters to spice up a rather straight forward adventure that I had developed. As a standalone adventure I would recommend staying away. It isn't that the adventure is bad . It's just that it needs work.Of course, some may look at it as a strength for a resource to be so flexible."
4,Very pleased Nana,I purchased this toy for my 3 year old grandson. He is very pleased with it. It is easy for him to use all by himself. The pictures are great and he likes the sound effects. My only complaint would be that there are not enough different sounds with each set of pictures.
5,Loved it.,My grandson has gotten many hours of joy from this view master. The reels are perfect for him. I would recommend it.
4,Kaleidoscope - 4.5 Stars!,"Excellent debut! Kelis and the Neptunes definitely have chemistry. This is a great CD for people looking for a different sound than typical R&B.; Being a Neptunes fan is almost just as important because you're gonna get an earful of them on this CD. I really enjoy it a lot.Fave tracks:* Get Along With You - and PLEASE check out the video. It's perfect for the song* I Want Your Love - This one just get's me going, the beat is tight!* No Turning Back* Game Show - this one is fun and the beat is perfect for the lyrics* Caught Out There* Wouldn't You Agree* In the MorningWait...Have I pretty much listed the entire CD? See what I mean? Pick this up.Happy listening!"
5,"Fishing Poles In the North, South, East, and West","Kaleidoscope is fish and chic pure, a growing of sounds perfectly composed and appropriate for recognizing the best of the Kelis musical style, reflecting of her huge ego, angry recognition for all the do you wrong partners, and still she fights in tracks to be forgiving and understanding. If you tryna like somebody, listen to some out of this world or just go play on Mars. A total classic mood up in the words of the Aborne. I wonder if many more will miss the bait? Hum"
4,Wild!!,"In my opinion, Kelis defines her genre. This CD is not for the faint at heart or the commercial fan. This is soulful music. Kelis holds her own vocally. Great debut album!!"
4,Nice Style...,"Kelis isn't afraid to be herself. I love artist like this. The album is very diverse and the production is great. On ""Good Stuff"" Kelis gives us a warning not to sleep on her and after a sound listen....I'm awake.."
4,Raw Neptunes,"I really do feel like I slept on this cd since I just purchased it recently. My only problem with the cd is that the Neptunes aren't the best songwriters lyric wise, and they wrote all of the songs on the cd, with Kelis contributing to maybe three songs. I feel like there weren't any songs that showcased her voice, and you can tell that the Neptunes were pretty new and raw as far as production goes. Still definitely a great cd though....."
2,Not Feelin It,"I would've given it 2 and a half stars if possible, but since it's not, I think Kaleidoscope is closer to 2 than three. She uses some novel themes (i.e. Mafia) but not all that well. She also has a decent singing voice, but I don't think the Neptunes production works for a full length R&B joint. My two favorite songs are ""Game Show"" and ""Ghetto Children"""
4,Not your everyday sound,"This young lady shows that she is original and that she can sing! Kelis can not be labled in the standard slots that the Music companies have today. She is definitely an artist for the new century. I loved the album and I feel with a little work, she will be a force to reckon with."
1,Very disappointing,"I heard ""Caught out there"" and wanted to hear more from Kelis. After reading the great reviews from amazon.com - I gave it a shot. What a great disappointment. Of the 14 tracks listed only four make any musical sense. She has a great voice but the songs that she sings are bland and ""way way out there."" ""Game Show"",""Mars"", ""Mafia"" and ""Roller Rink"" are the worst songs I've ever heard. Don't waste your money. Buy the singles until she gets some decent material."
2,Ditch the Album for the single,"Ok, so the Kelis single ""Caught Out There"" is outrageously good. The beat is amazing and the lyrics, well let's say real. Once you get the Cd though, it is terrible. The only other good cut is ""Good Stuff"", so basically once you pass the intro and the two good songs, you're in for a mighty boring ride the rest of the way.The only remotely bright spot after the first three tracks is ""Mars"". The originality that was so overpowering on ""Caught Out There"" is gone once you pass it. Kelis has such a good voice and it's a shame that it gets wasted on so many songs. If anyone thinks that this CD is good all the way through...stop smoking the crack and listen again. Buy the single....save your extra $10."
5,I play it all the time,I love Kelis' music. It is different from every body else even her cover and her video is strikingly different. She is the future of music her style is all her own as she said `The way I dress is a reflection of me'.
4,SUSPENDED-THIS SONG IS UNREAL !,"PICKED UP THIS CD AFTER HEARING THE SINGLE ""CAUGHT OUT THERE"" BECAUSE OF THE ORIGINALITY OF THE SONG (PHAT PRODUCTION), AND I'M SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE. I THINK THE SONG ""SUSPENDED"" IS WORTH THE 13 DOLLARS ALONE , THE SWEET MELODY (SOUNDS LIKE IT'S FROM A 60'S ERA POP SONG) AND THAT WONDERFUL CHORUS IS STUCK ON MY MIND. THIS CD HAS RESTORED MY FAITH IN THE FUTURE OF R&B. GREAT JOB KELIS ! P.S. ALTHOUGH I'M MALE , I STILL THOUGHT ""CAUGHT OUT THERE"" WAS PHAT !"
4,smoothie,"now, I felt that it was exactly the mixture of different styles, that many reviewers talked about, that helped to produce a very smooth blend of musical aspects. the result was a particularly accomplished piece of music that, although perhaps cannot be categorised as one type of music, managed to fit into a league of its own. all of the songs, in my opinion, are gritty and heart-felt, and one can almost feel the music in one's stomach, whether it's the hip-hop influences and strong bassline of ""Good Stuff"" or the song which always makes me cry, ""Just Wanna Get Along With You""... brilliant album... you go, girl!!"
4,Something Fresh and Original!,"Kelis is certainly a a refreshing newcomer. The world has a tendency to put black performers in a box (immediately R&B or Rap or Hip-Hop). Kelis falls out of this easy categorization. Her music is hard to pinpoint. Her product is an amalgam of techno, rap, hip-hop and rock. She has a strong, resonant voice - which surprises you (she's only 20 years old). I recommend this album for those who want something fresh and new. Kelis has staying power. This album demonstrates samples of her aptitude. With some fine-tuning here and there . . .she will go places. My friends who have listened to my cd have loved it too. Go and get it."
4,Had to get it.....glad I did,"This a great CD. It took a minute for it to grow on me. But after listening to it for 2 hour car ride, I was hooked. It's got great messages and the production was tight. she ain't one of the best voices out there but she got a lot of these ""studio altered artist"" beat. If you heard the debut single she put out, weather you like that song or not, the rest of the CD isn't anything like it at all. So it might be a chance you might like it.oNe"
5,'Kaleidoscope' is 'Good Stuff',"I got this CD as soon as it came out. The song ""Caught Out There"" was catchy and didn't sound like anything I had been hearing on the radio. Kelis intrigued me with her unique vocals and wild multi-colored hair. I listened to ""Kaleidoscope"" so much that I got sick of it and sold it. Big mistake! I want it back and I can't seem to find it anywhere. ""Kaleidoscope"" is definetly a good R&B album and my favorite songs are ""Caught Out There,"" ""Game Show,"" ""Suspended,"" ""Ghetto Children,"" ""Roller Rink,"" and the Spanish-esque ""I Want Your Love."" This CD also exposed me to The Neptunes and their signature sound, which is well known by now. Overall, this is very good music."
4,"Kelis, ""I love you so much right now!""","When you hear the name Kelis, what do you think of? Possibly ""I HATE YOU SO MUCH RIGHT NOW""? Well this album will turn that phrase around for you. Kelis is a breath of fresh air in an industry of watered down rnb and pop. Combine her unique style with Neptunes beats and you have a winner. My standout tracks are ""Good Stuff"", ""Caught Out There"", ""Suspended"", ""Mars"", and ""In The Morning"". Actually, most of these tracks are stand out. A solid 4 star album from Kelis and the Neptunes."
2,weak & werid,"va does it again.....is that the best way to put it? kelis isn't a bad singer, but would u call this rnb? the album is tottally different, which i'm sure most people are thinking is cool, but it is so different that maybe, she should have switched a few things up.first the singles ""caught out there"" & ""get along with you"" are amazing. rnb & alternative, as well as hip hop are blended into one to create this werid sound, produced by the neptunes. but no other songs are like this. there are all weak songs, and no ballads! can u believe that? this isn't an rnb album.not only are the guest artists never heard of, for example: N.E.R.D, Markita, etc.... but the rest of the album are weak, weak, material, that shows y this album went no where. ""mafia"", ""talk show"", ""roller rink"", ""mars"" i mean c'mon.kelis needs to hit the studio and work on a good album, and when she does, then i'll check her out."
1,Couldn't get into the groove,"I so dig Get Along With You, even the vid. But the rest of the album didn't quite do it. The songs are boring and the beats sometimes start to sound the same. I REALLY wanted to love this album. Tried to -- 'cause I'm always down to support sisters who don't fit anyone's standards. Nonetheless, this CD is going back to the store. I'll wait for the CD single, watch her interesting vids and check for the next CD if there will be one. My advice: listen closely and repeatedly to all the songs before you plunk down your money."
4,Great all around lens,"I got this lens a while back at B&H before I realized that amazon sold almost everything I could find there for at least a slightly lower price and with free shipping. This lens gives me clear shots up and down it's focal length, vignetting and warping issues I've seen on other wider angle lenses seem to be nil on this one. Combined with my d200, this rig does get a bit heavy on the arm, but it is worth the quality of the focus and the great depth of field."
5,Sigma 17-70 best of breed,"I shoot Nikon. I have owned the Sigma 17-70 for over 2 years and it has always done a super job. I have reviewed the work of a lot of other photographers using all kinds of lenses, many much more expense than the Sigma, and at least once a week I thank God I bought the Sigma 17-70.The hidden feature of this camera is that the min. focal length is a little over 6 inches, but this distance is from the sensor in the camera to the subject. You can almost touch the subject with the lens and still get focus. Close up you can get some great shallow DOF shots with this camera and at least to me the blurred bokeh is pleasing.Do not make the mistake of selling Sigma short. For the money no Nikon lense even comes close to the Sigma 17-70.The only slack on the Sigma 17-70 being sold through Amazon is the seller's claim that the lens usually goes for over $600. The ""sales"" price being stated for this lens is the normal price you can get anywhere.Snapping out,d"
5,Great Lens,"Great ""walk around"" lens. The major plus over the Nikon kit lens that came with my D-90 is the macro feature. The clarity in Macro is sharp as a tack.The minus is that there is no Anti Vibration feature. I am sure that Sigma will add this as time goes on.On a scale of 1-10 I give this lens an 8. It's not the best of the best, but it is a really good lens, focuses really fast, great macro and the price just can't be beat.Great Deal, Great lens!"
3,"good but useless cuz it falls out of focus, don't get it",I am a professional photographer who wanted a lens that would be good for travel and casual shooting around the city. I also wanted the lens to be able to translate over to my portrait photography business as well. When I firsat used the lens it kept falling out of focus even when I would manually focus. It seemed to do this the second the shutter when off. This is a horrible lens because what good is a lens if it doesn't focus!
5,olivia's best !,"i have or have owned almost every album onj ever recorded and this is her best work. it's actually better than her grease work. some may be put off by the sexy image of the cover, but other than the racy songs, ""totally hot"" and ""gimme some lovin""it's pretty much the olivia everyone has always known and loved. boats against the current is my favorite song. it is truly a beautiful song. you won't regret this puchase."
4,The Beginning Of A New Era,"""Totally Hot"" was the turning point For Olivia. This album was released shortly after ""Grease"" and preceeded both ""Xanadu"" and ""Physical."" Olivia was experimenting with different sounds here, a touch of disco, country, and straight forward pop. The opening track, ""Don't Keep Me Waiting 'Round"" starts upbeat, but ends on a shreeching finish, I'm not sure why her producer let her do that. ""Deeper Than The Night"" and ""Little More Love"" were hits from this album, I remember when those songs were all over the radio, they are my favorites from this album. Both songs are upbeat and effortlessly sung. ""Gimme Some Lovin'"" is by far a most interesting cover Olivia has done to date. She lets it rip on this version. The cover art offers a glimpse of the style of music on this album, the style certainly marks time, but it's just a lot of fun."
3,Bought Two!,"I purchased this Import for Clinton Kelly (TLC's What Not To Wear), and then a second copy for myself. The songs are so-o-o well-done, and the title track is, indeed, Totally Hot!"
5,Riveting & Revealing,"Dr. Grobman has written an incisive book on the little known and, until now, much maligned role of the Vaad Hatzala in the rescue of Jews in the dark days of the Shoah and subsequently. Battling for Souls is a riveting exposition of the emotional and spiritual damage-control effort of a small group of selfless people determined to return to the surviving victims that which was ripped from them by the Nazi beasts; their faith and religious self-esteem. For the first time in print, Grobman documents the yeoman efforts of the Vaad to provide spiritual sustenance to the survivors, something that was ""overlooked"" by other rescue organizations.Rabbi Yale B. Butler"
4,Screwballs,"Like Augusten Burroughs' hysterical autobiography ""Running With Scissors,"" Leguizano's family of loose screws made him a screwball, for better or for worse.At turns morose and gross, and gutbusting and bitingly real, you will transported by a family, though superficially unlike your own, eventually begins to resemble your childhood memories."
2,Ultimately Unfulfilling,"In my opinion, John Leguizamo is both funny and talented, but this book exploits neither of these qualities. It's an extremely quick read (about 60-90 minutes), and while there are 1-2 chuckles here and there, it's much too compressed to be an effective autobiography, and not enough humor to be a decent ""gag"" book. It does live up to it's ""semi-demi"" title, but unfortunately it adds up to be disappointing."
5,the BEST long underwear for kids who don't like a tight fit!!!,I have bought these for both my kids. the fabric is so soft and the relaxed fit is far more enjoyable for them. I bought the pink hearts and black pants and top...just perfect.
1,Not for Muslims or vegan. There is gelatins in it.,I don't understand why they need to add pig fats in it. Had to give it away as it is not halal. Muslims beware.
1,Why do their organic foods contain gelatin???,I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value. I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
1,GELATIN in baby food,"Do not buy product contain gelatin. Gelatin in baby food ??? Why gerber ???, Do not buy if you follow vegetarian or kosher/Halal regime."
2,"Good product, but bad from Amazon","I love Gerber organic products like this which combine veggies and/or fruits. I bought one of the ""Farmers Market"" from the regular grocery store to make sure my 8 month old liked it, which he did. I bought a case from Amazon, but the consistency was like soup, very runny unlike the one I bought from the store. Heating it up made it worse. Maybe it was a fluke, but the second case from Amazon ordered a few months later had the same problem."
5,Good Breakfast,My 18m old loves this for his morning breakfast. This is one of the few flavors he will eat. We give him 1x baby food breakfast & 1x yogurt every day.
2,My twins hates it!,"I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one. They eat just about every Gerber's organics."
4,interesting,"I heard about this movie when it first came out and finally bought it summer 2012. If you follow the markets closely and are interested in the people on the ground in the trading business, you will like the movie. It explored a number of different personality types and how trading affected them. And a movie with the Najarian brothers is always worth a look."
4,Nice Liotta Flick,"We wake up in a desert. It feels hot, itchy and a bit dreamy, and who the hell am I anyway? From here our protagonist stumbles fortuitously into scrapes and close-calls with dangerous people who all want something from him now, or else - if only he could remember what.Jack (no fixed last name) reflexively outwits his dangers and forestalls any consequences, while piecing together fragments of his former life - with an acute new perspective on it. It's a good hypothesis - what if a man could all of a sudden see his life objectively, and how would he react?The film, shot in Mexico, has a great hot and sticky look (a la Traffic), and Armin Mueller-Stahl is a bonus as the oddly-named ""MacCaulay"" (sounding more East German than Scot.) Other players mainly support Jack's movement in the story, and it feels that way sometimes."
4,An Amusing Farce,"An amusing book that makes fun of the conventions of Sword and Sorcery Fantasy novels. It has an Evil Overlord, Princes vying for the hand of a Princess, Evil Assistants Minions and chain-mail bras. The protagonist is Prince Kevin, son of Eric the Cool, who wants to win the hand of Princess Rebecca (The Ice Princess). His campaign to get the council of lords to award him her hand is derailed when Ancient Artifact #7 disappears. His cheif rival, a mighty warrior is awarded Rebecca's hand return for his leading an army to return the artifact. Kevin refuses to accept this, so he heads out to the castle of the Evil Voltmeter to recover the artifact first. Hilarity ensues.This is a light read (I read it in about 1/2 a day), but an amusing one. I would recomend it. It manages to poke fun at the genre while remaining an interesting story."
3,Funny but not great,"While Heroics for Beginners has more than it's share of chuckles, it seems at times to try a little too hard. The fairy tale land it takes place in is cute, but not as fleshy as it could be. The characters have the same problem.I wouldn't go so far as to say ""avoid this,"" just maybe wait for the bargain bin.It is a cute, light read. It's just that it could be a lot better."
4,A whole new dimension to chemical physics,"This is an excellent pioneering work in th efield of chemical pjysics and the details are correctly updated.A fanatastic book for all those researchers who are interested in a quality work in the firld of chemical physics.The approach to go into details of single perturbation is very nicely dealt with, All in all an excellent source of knowledge about chemical physics."
4,One really good episode...,"While I have to admit the end of the German Knight saga and the beginning of the Feng Shui arc are lame, the 3rd episode on the DVD, ""To my Angel Misao: A Fetching From Kyoto"" has to be one of the funniest and worth watching episodes of the series (worth 4 stars by itself).It's worth buying this DVD to see this one episode. Too bad it got stuck on this DVD, but I strongly reccomend watching it.A smart mix of seriousness and humor, it shows the first serious signs of Aoshi having feelings for Misao, yet hilarity ensues when a group of characters go out for the day."
3,An entertaining series,"This is a well done series totally overall. Some episodes dragged on, like the animators are hurting occassionally for plot line or the editor was sleeping who knows. But overall the series will entertain you well. However don't miss an episode this series is one you have to start at the beginning and follow to the end or you'll become confused as to what is the plot. The animation itself is very well done."
3,Pedal Boat Cover,"Classic Accessories Silver-Tech Polyester Pedal Boat Cover (Silver, Fits 3 or 5 Person Boat)This cover is okay but I have one caveat. I purchased this cover to keep rainwater out of the boat. But now when it rains the water collects on top of the cover which then slips down into the seat indentations. When you try to take the cover off, it is impossible to keep the water from spilling into the boat. This defeats the whole purpose. However, I solved the problem. I purchased several cheap beach balls and put one in each seat indentation before putting the cover on. The balls hold the cover up and keep it from sinking down into the seat holes. This works pretty well and does keep the rain water out."
3,paddleboat,"works fair, cord around edge should be adjustable. wind blew it off first night. installed canvas hooks [from amazon] on both sides & strung a line to each & tighten down. 40 mph winds & its still in place. thanks! carlc."
4,Silver-Tech Polyester Pedal Boat Cover,"I own an older pedal boat we have had for years. Cleaning and bailing it out has been a dreaded task. Now with my new pedal boat cover, it keeps the boat both clean and dry. It fits well and stays in place when windy. I found this a great purchase for quite a low price. I'm so pleased!"
1,Junk,"This cover is no good. I bought it because it was suppose to fit a Pelican Pedal boat, however the cover did not fit and the material felt very cheap. I returned the item to Amazon with no issues."
3,"Would NOT fit a 5 person Pelican ""Energy"" Pedal Boat","Despite being described otherwise, this cover would NOT fit on our Pelican 5 person ""Energy"" pedal boat, no matter how hard we tried. The only way to make it fit would have been to rip it! Boxing it up to put away, the box said it ""fits 3-5 person pedal boats, including Pelican."" So we opened it back up and tried again, thinking maybe we could finagle it. No way. It simply does not fit, about 5"" too short and too narrow."
5,Pedal Boat Cover,"The boat cover arrived in excellent condition and in time (it was a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law). The price was very reasonable. Thanks, Amazon!"
4,works but there is sag,it works but with rain it sags. i place clips on the center of all four sides and empty 5 gal cans in the seat. with this it creates a crest so the rain will roll off. the fabric is ok just the sag of the fabric causes a problem. besides that it does the job of protecting from having a boat full of water.
4,good entertainment,"My daughter and I gave this pedal boat to my son-in-law for his farm pond. First day out it was a big hit with kids from 2 to 60. Easy to pedal and will hold two adults and three children. Also let it go out with two 12-year-olds and they had no trouble taking it where they wanted to go. My husband took it for a spin to fish from.We bought the cover, but the boat is lite weight enough that 2 people can easily put it in the back of a pick-up so it will be stored in the barn when not in use. Cover will keep the dust off."
2,did not fit my pelican 5 seater,"very thin material and did not fit, too small, too late to return. very disappointing"
2,The box cover is the sexiest part of this video!,"Granted, this thing was made at least four decades ago, and I'm sure they thought it was really risque at the time. But today it's just BORING. There's some implied girl-girl attraction, but nothing ever materializes. I applaud the people in marketing for putting that picture on the box, because they succeeded in luring me into purchasing a videotape I NEVER would have bought had I seen it first!"
4,Great series,Love the GH series. If you're into this sort of thing you can't go wrong adding this to your collection.
4,Ghost hunters,"its a very good tape to watch, I am a bigger ghost hunter watcher, The shows are very while done"
4,Expected more,"I have all six seasons of their shows. However I expected a little more out of Season 7 part 1. I felt the best show was the last one on disc 3. I did not expect for all of the deleted scenes to be on the forth disc. I figured maybe a few more shows and then deleted scenes, but not a whole disc of deleted scenes. For me, that was a let done. As always they bring the history of where they are investing into the investigation. Over all, descent value. I will be buying Season 7 part 2 and hopefully it will not be my last purchase."
2,good show bad packaging,I recieved this with season 6 part 2. The box from amazon was poorly handled not even a piece of tape to keep closed. The DVD box for season 6 was made for four disks and leads me to think it was pirated. It was also cracked and the disks although playable were scratched. The season 7 DVD box was a joke. Thin as a single disk box all four disks piled on top of each other. Also making me think was a fake copy. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the disks although scratched were playable and the show is great. As far as shipping I am very disapointed. I have ordered many things from amazon and have never recieved such poor packaging from either amazon or a product.
3,The Same Old Thing.,"I Love this show but it has become the same old thing now. In the early seasons they caught amazing things, now with all this higher tech equipment and still going to these ""Super Haunted Locations"" they find nothing. Just knocks, some weak EVP's and of course footsteps. I never thought I would get tired of this show, but it is just the same old thing, I don't get how people see all these shadow figures all the time and when the Ghost Hunters team is there they all of a sudden don't want to come out. Sorry Guys, I still like to watch Jason and Maddie is adorable."
2,"Lost this book, but don't even miss it","I left this behind in NY when I was doing web consulting.I don't even miss it! I was using it more as a referencewhen going Broadvision and DHTML programming. In the eraof Netscape 4.7, we had to workaround a lot of problems....I find the O'reilly Javascript:Definitive guide to be much more approachable."
1,Kitten wouldn't eat it,"My 3 month old kitten wouldn't eat it. Now I'm left with 2.75 bags full of worthless kitten food. Do not recommend this product, and advise you to spend a little more for quality."
5,Fancy Hit Party a Hit,"It's too bad Fancy was not better known in the USA, he would have been an even bigger star than he was. His music is great. Unlike most other CD's I own, which I only like one or two songs, the Fancy Hit Party doesn't contain a single track I don't like."
3,Not that good.............,"I just received this CD today, and I must say that I'm a bit disappointed. Growing up as a kid, ""Lady of Ice"" was my favorite European dance song. To me, it's one of the songs that defines this genre of music. On this compilation, there's 4 other decent tracks, specifically ""Slice Me Nice"", ""Bolero"", and the 2 new versions of ""Flames of Love"". The updated versions is definitely a huge improvement over their original 80's versions.The rest of the tracks on this CD are unfortunately very dreadful. For a compilation, I had much higher expectations. I would have rated this CD at 2 stars, but the greatness of ""Lady of Ice"" bumps it up to 3 stars."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","It's only a couple of good songs on the whole CD, rest of the staff could be selected with better care. Still it's nice to have for anyone who likes to collects 80-s disco music."
3,DVD is WEAK and TOO SHORT!!,"I have to agree with the following people this DVD just doesn't cut it. Its too short and could of had some iterviews with the band. FALSE ADVERTISING!the reason i bought this DVD was to see the old ""CAN I KICK IT"" video and its not the orignal sound its a REMIX!I HOPE JIVE READS THIS AND ISSUES OUT A NEW DVD WITH MORE TO IT AND DON'T FORGET TO PUT THE ORIGNAL SONG TO THE VIDEO ""CAN I KICK IT""!"
3,"on tv, it's better and cheaper!","amid tanks of fish, the actors slog thru the film. goe. brent as usual is saccharine and solicitous. hedy, well she's loverly, but her usualundimensional self. paul lukas, who had an under-rated career, is successfully menacing and enigmatic (puzzle, puzzle, who is this ""gaslight""husband). ""gaslight"" was a fine film, this is not necessarily that. i watched on a home theater (big screen); this one is better seen on a 21""set (do they still make them that small?!). when all is said and done, the cliches were kinda fun."
5,Not like the others...,"This is the writing book you have to read, right before Stephen King's On Writing. I still reread them and find great inspiration. All us writers need to know we're not alone in this...Boo WalkerAuthor ofLowcountry Punch"
3,"A lot of common sense, not necessarily what I expected.","For aspiring writers wanting to get some heavy insight into the steps, practices, discipline and a ""how-to"" look into becoming a Novelist, you may want to look elsewhere.While ""On Becoming a Novelist"" is a decent read, I found the content somewhat disengaging making the book, overall, hard pressed to keep my attention."
4,Informative!,I would love to write a novel one day and this book has helped me get more ideas on how to start.
3,Twink - 'The Lost Experimental Recordins: 1970' (Get Back),"I give it 3 1/2 stars. Nicely assembled Italian import of the Pink Fairie's drummer Twink's long-lost cutting-room-floor material that was recorded maybe just prior to his 'Think Pink' classic (see my review of that disc) and nearly as good. Total of sixteen tracks. Some of the cuts here that did it for me were the acoustic ""You Reached For The Skies"", ""Moondog"", ""Psychedelic Electrician (Scene One)"" - nice moog work and ""Witches Brew"". Keep in mind that this CD is a bit different than the previously mentioned 'Think Pink' reissue. I would still recommended it to any fans of Pink Fairies, Electric Banana, Tomorrow or just late '60's psych in general. A nice find."
5,A much better mousetrap!!!,"I have managed warehouses and distribution centers for over 20 years. I have never found a gun that was so well designed. Sturdy, ergonomic, and safe! The padded, ergonomic grip with handy thumb tab and retractable blade really set this product apart from the rest. If you have ever used another style, try this out and you'll never go back. Not to mention that it's price is extremely competitive$$$"
1,Poor Ergonomics,"It's cute, but it takes an extreme wrist movement to cut the tape and the balance of the head/handle is just awful. I have an older, less cute tape dispenser that seems to do the work for me. This is a disappointment, but not worth losing half the price of the item to ship it back. It'll be in the next charity collection."
3,Okay But Not Life-changing,I bought this because of all the great reviews it had. I am a bit disappointed because it is actully more difficult to use than the cheap red one from Wally World. I like to tape along all edges of my boxes and this does not perform well here. Everytime I run it along the edge I have to reset the tape. It will not stay put in the lips. This is very time consuming. My old red one works great but doesn't cut the tape neatly every time leaving a lot of scraggly ends. I use a very thin tape so maybe it will work better with heavier tape? Right now I am using it as a back-up for my trusty old Red.
4,An Excellent Learning Guide,"If you are interested in Documentary Film, this is a great introduction to the genre. Barnouw brings you through history with ease and enjoyment. I found it extremely satisfactory; definitely not a disappointment."
3,Good F/ Intended Use,"For the money, these systems do the job. This is the 2nd purchase made of this system for our church. Use them for dramas and youth events. Your first impression will not be a good one. There will be a label on top of the receiver that comes off to the touch proclaiming it to be a ""Quality"" product. Batteries are included...dead batteries. And the lapel mic clips are rather cheap. Surprisingly, the sound quality is pretty good. Much better than expected. One unit has lasted for over a year with no problems. I don't have to worry about having one damaged or lost. Plus... two mics on one mixer channel. That helps when you are limited on the mixer."
3,Wireless Microphone system,"The operation and range is very good, clean without distortion.The quality of the mikes compared to my wired EV or Shure is notas good, I like the sound of my voice better for my own performancebut for general Karaoke usage with audience participation this systemis very acceptable and even good for its price."
4,2Pac & Biggie Collabs Make It Worth Buying,"I got this CD from Amazon.com for just under $5 total and gotta say for such a cheap price this is a good CD. My favorite tracks are:Where Ya At? - Ice Cube and other great artists make an appearance!Runnin' - Main reason I wanted the CD! Forget that Eminem remix on the Tupac Resurrection OST!Hocus Pocus - not a great track but not bad either187um - this is the best track Dr. Dre & Snoop Dogg have ever made together! the lyrics are hard and greatNo Surrender - as can be expected of any Bone Thugs song, pretty good!Destroy All Masters - not a great song but still good"
4,"Not exactly a Million, but good","im surprised 2 be the first 2 review dis cd , but its not a bad purchase if ur looking 4 2pac and big collabos and 5 percent NOI retoric especialliy in the song by x clan i think there should of been more referance about the Nation and the motherland but still some good rappin and great artists from Chuck d to the RZAbuy it !!!"
1,Lasts two weeks,"I got this charger for my Sony Ericsson T610, to replace my original that I lost. The first one I got lasted 2, maybe 3 weeks and stopped working. I returned the charger to Amazon and asked for a replacement - kudos to Amazon returns service, it's brilliant, I had my replacement charger shipped second day. But my replacement charger lasted two weeks and ceased working just like the first one. And I noticed that when I plugged in my phone to charge it, the charger quickly drained whatever battery power my phone had left. My recommendation, don't loose your original Sony Ericsson charger and if you do, get an original replacement."
2,Cheaply constructed,"Literally within one minute of opening the package in which charger arrived at my door, one of the plastic clips that secures the charger to the phone whilst in use had broken. I plugged the charger in and connected it to my phone in order to see if it did indeed work. Seeing the indication on my phone's display that it was charging, I removed the plug only to see a disconcerting piece of black plastic break off the end of the plug end of the charger. It still functions, but with only one clip connecting phone and charger, I have to be careful to place the phone in such a way that the plug won't spontaneously pop out. Of course, I now handle the charger with kid gloves, as I live in fear that the other clip will break off, rendering the thing completely useless."
1,Very bad quality,"I purchased this item on March 13th 2006, and used it about 3 times while I was travelling (I did not use my phone very much at all). When I got home (I was away for 2 months) I tried to use it again, but one of the blades was missing, and a red wire poking through instead. I can only think it pulled out and was left in the hotel recepticle!Amazon would not replace this for me as it was over 30 days since my order. (This effectively means everything they sell only has a guarantee for 30 days! Makes you wonder!)"
1,Greatly Disappointed,"We purchased this charger and disregarded other customers warnings about the faulty quality. The charger had a wire exposed when it arrived which we taped, and then the tip fell off. I would not buy a charger from Amazon againUltra Slim Travel Charger for Sony Ericsson Z500a, S710a"
1,Worthless piece of garbage,"This thing is awful - after 1 week of light use, the plastic prong broke off, and it doesn't work. Tells me that it's time to get a new phone, one which has READILY AVAILABLE chargers should I lose mine."
4,Insightful!,"John Harper offers a worthwhile, if dry, look at a topic that is too rarely addressed in business literature, namely, how to create, structure and operate a board of directors. One of the book's most useful features is first-person sidebars from well-known directors and business leaders, who offer practical advice on key topics. The appendices are also informative, focusing on corporate governance issues and the legal best practices every board member should know. Written with the interests of board chairmen foremost in mind, this book provides a thoughtful look at the major issues likely to confront any board. Although you may have to search hard to find anything novel in its approach, perhaps that's appropriate, given the inherently cautious and conservative nature of most boards. We recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve corporate governance, particularly those who serve on boards of directors."
1,stupid movie,"just watch the final fight and put on here that you disagree with me. Dragon lee is an ok fighter but not even in my top 100. I'm sure he's not even in my top 1000 if I knew all these guys names. This movie is retarded and stupid to watch, nto raiders of nuddhist kung fu bad, but seriously very bad."
4,Women's Health,"This book is very informative and looks at women's health from a female point of view. Situations common to women's lives are taken into account and their impact on women's health is examined. Very interesting, you'll find things you have not considered before."
2,too simple,"Much too simple for the topic. If you are a medical professional i would skip this one. If you have OA, RA, or want some nutrition advice atypical of your MD, give it a shot. You can pick it up for < $5."
3,Go Further,"Good approach to the all-encompassing mind, body and and spirit of women, but needs to go further to be a prope textbook. Consider Gangi's view of holistic health and incorporate it with this one."
1,Not Impressed,This book is very basic and I knew more than the book had to say by just doing google searches. The book does have lots and lots of sites to visit on the 'net (too many) but it seems to me that there are more sites listed than actual information! Anyone can do internet searches.....you don't need a book to tell you how. This book is very disappointing. $25 for internet sites that you can get free yourself is highway robbery in my humble opinion. Not impressed at all. A waste of money.
2,"Great idea, but not tough enough!","I bought the large Squirrel Dude for my Labrador, and I think it is a great toy in theory. I used medium-sized treats, and it was a nice challenge for him to try to get them out. He would play with it all day if I let him. However, he began taking chunks out of the rubber within a few days and I have now had to take it away from him. It definitely cannot withstand a powerful chewer, and I am very disappointed that I spent the money for this toy after reading so many good reviews."
2,My dog was not at all interested,"My lab-mix is extremely food driven, so I was hopeful for this product I put kibble in, and she won't even give it a second look. She can smell the kibble, but won't play with it. I even demonstrated to her that she could get the kibble out of it, but she won't even sniff at it on her own. I realize all dogs have their own tastes, but this didn't interest my dog in the least, so you can take that for what it's worth."
3,Heavy and Not Played with Often,"This is a great toy in theory, but it is a very very heavy rubber that my dogs aren't fond of."
4,A great toy!,"I have tried many different work-to-eat toys with our dog, and this one is by far the best. The best feature is that the hole isn't too large, so the treats don't all dump out at once. The other thing I love about it is that it has little rubber teeth ON THE INSIDE which hold the treats in. Other toys I tried with those little Y-shaped openings, Lily just chewed the rubber tabs off immediately leaving a huge hole. These she can't get to, which is genius. Another issue I have had with other toys is that they are incredibly noisy. This one is not, which is a huge plus. My only suggestion to people looking to buy this toy is buy a larger size than you think you need; we have the medium one, and Lily is constantly chasing it under the couch and we are always having to retrieve it for her. The next one I buy will be a larger size so it doesn't get lost as easily."
2,Didn't stand up to my chew-happy dog,"I bought this for my medium-sized dog, who is a very aggressive chewer. The squirrel design is really cute, but it was in pieces within a couple hours. So far the only toys she hasn't been able to totally destroy are theKONG Classic Kong, Large Red."
5,Great for aggressive chewers,I bought two of these one for my italian greyhound and one for my lab mix. This is one of the few toys that keep both of them occupied for a long time. I put regular size dog bones in these amongst other treats in and they do not fall out easily like in the kongs. My mix aggressively chews and she has not been able to rip this one apart! Very worth the few dollars these cost.
2,Not what dog likes,"Tried peanut butter in it, but dog didn't like licking it out. Treats were too hard to get out, so tried to trim the insides, now to open and treats fall out too easily."
1,This squirrel is a dud not a dude,It was impossible for my dog to get any of the treats out of this toy. I was very disappointed with how it was made. Would not buy again.
5,very good product,Easy to fill and the dogs will play with it to get the goodies. They got the idea pretty quickly that you have to roll it around to get anything.
5,Keeps my dogs busy for hours!,"I originally bought one of these, but I after it arrived I was forced to buy another as it quickly became a favorite for all three of my dogs to the point of them squabbling with eachother over it! These things are wonderful! I have a pitbull, a rhodesian ridgeback, and a boxer/shepard mix and these stand up to their chewing. It has been a couple weeks, and they are still intact. I stuff snausages up there and they are very hard for them to get out, but not impossible which keeps them occupied (but not frustrated) for a long time.If you want it to be easier, you can trim off the prongs, but I would rather make them work for it. Such a great purchase!"
5,Squirrel Dude is the best!,"Squirrel Dude provides hours of entertainment for our 18 month old golden. She is an incredible shredding machine who has destroyed many so-called indestructible toys, but Squirrel Dude has held up just fine. She carries it around and tosses and bounces it to get small kibble or cereal pieces out. We did not modify the tabs so it takes some effort to get the food out and there's a random quality about when something comes out so she stays interested. She is quickly bored with her Kong; a cookie is too hard to get out, and she can clear out peanut butter in under 2 minutes. With another Premier product, the Tug-a-Jug, she just ate the rope, so we are delighted to finally find a toy she likes and hasn't destroyed."
5,Great product!,I can only buy my dogs certain toys because they are fierce chewers. I usually only buy Kong or West Paw but took a chance on this brand and it paid off. My dogs love this toy and so far it has proven to be indestructible. If a toy is going to be ripped apart and ruined it usually happens within the first 10 minutes of them playing with it. We have had this toy for a couple of weeks and it shows no sign of damage.
3,"OK, but not for strong chewers","Our pitbull got one of these the other night. She LOVES it, but after a few hours of play, it's already missing chunks."
2,Stinky,"My dogs won't touch this foul smelling thing. Although we place treats inside, the stench of rubber is so strong the dogs ignore this toy. Our miniature Schanzer is big enough to chew it but won't and our maltese is too small for it. Not a great choice."
2,Large size doesn't work with kibble - don't bother,"I got this hoping to keep my dog occupied for a while working to get her food. I bought the large size squirrel dude, but it has a wide hole in the end with tiny prongs that do nothing to keep the food in the toy. The food just falls right out. It might work better with wet food or peanut butter, but not kibble."
5,Great toy for feeding time!,"Our dog goobles up food in seconds, so we are always looking for a new food toy to help him slow down eating. This toy holds the right amount of his food, and helps him take a little bit longer to eat it. Our only concern is that our dog has unusually small kibble, so he does still get it out fast, but it's great if you have larger kibble!"
4,Works like a charm,My dog loves this toy. I fill it up with his dog kibble and he can play with it for quite a while trying to get his food out. The plastic is soft enough so it doesn't bang up my kitchen cabinets but is also hard enough where my terrier can't destroy it. He's really tough on toys and can destroy things in minutes. This one passes the test! Highly recommend.
1,Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!,"Product smells and tastes terrible, bitter! I washed the product when it first arrived, dog wouldn't play with it. After handling it at one point, my hands were bitter. I don't know what it's made of or treated with, but multiple washes and soaking doesn't remove the bitterness. It's going back!"
2,It smells!,"The toy seem to be durable enough, but I am planning on returning it due to a very strong chemical/rubbery smell..."
5,A Great Buy!,"Our dog won't touch a toy unless it's filled with food. She's figured a lot of the puzzle toys out, and cleans out a classic Kong in record time. I really needed something to keep her occupied for an extended time, and Squirrel Dude is my man. It's similar to a classic Kong, except it has four flexible, triangular tabs in the opening. You can control the ""flow"" of food--simply leave the tabs as is to make the dog's job harder, or trim them so the food falls out faster. You'll have to gauge it based on the size of the treat you plan to use, and how dedicated your dog is. We like to fill this with smaller treats--kibble, bits of chicken jerky, Zuke's, and broken-up biscuits, so I just barely trimmed each tab and it works great. She'll work at this off and on all day, and sometimes will take longer than a day to empty it. We've had Squirrel Dude about six months--he takes a beating every day and has held up incredibly well. This was truly money well spent."
1,Chewed up in 5 minutes,"My local independent pet store highly recommended the large Squirrel Dude for my big dog who loves to chew. I gave it to him, and he had chewed off the head in less than five minutes. He was starting to swallow the rubber chunks he chewed off. I'm getting a refund. The label said that this toy ""is not considered indestructible"" -- no kidding!"
4,Bulldog loves it!,"I bought this for my bulldog. He uses this and the KONG genius. Both are very good, but I like this one because you can trim the prongs on it and make it easier if need be. The toy is VERY durable, but is not meant to be left out for the dog to chew on. Once the stuffing is out, pickup the toy and take it away. My dog loves to see this toy because he knows whenever it's out - he's getting a treat!"
3,Works ok...,"This works ok. My dog has a hard time getting food out of it, but if I cut the tabs I'll never be able to make it harder for him to get things ok. Lasted longer than a regular Kong, but not as useful."
3,Vivid Photographs. Well put together.,"The photographs are very done well and nicely put together. There is a German/English glossary in the back that is a plus. Unfortunately with this, as with other regalia and costume books, some of the hard to find uniform descriptions that I am lookng for are not in there. I have yet to see a description or photograph of a camp commandant's uniform, which surprises me. I would like one for my writing, but I'm about to give up on finding a description of what I need."
4,Too Much Emphasis on Officers,"This is a fine book except that it features only about 28 uniforms and more than half is devoted to officer uniforms. So it's a rather poor source for enlisted men's uniforms as seen on the battlefields. Maybe the title should read ""German Army Officer Uniforms and Misc. Others."" Also, it would've been nicer if the photos were shot not inside a studio.Young"
3,OK as it goes...,"This is a rather limited (126 pages) study of WW II German Army uniforms. It shows models wearing a selected variety of Army uniforms and equipment. The color photography is impeccable and is more helpful to collector identification than black and white photos or small color swatches.The uniforms and equipment that are presented are shown in great detail and can present useful information to a collector or reenactor, but if you are looking for a comprehensive reference book on German Army uniforms, this is not it."
2,No Smell,I was very disappointed when I received my oils. There was absolutely no fragrance to any of the four bottles that I purchased. I will not be purchasing this product online in the future.
3,"Smells great, but...","I love this product and have ordered it before. It's a great smell and because it's an oil, it lasts for hours unlike spray perfumes. However, the oil was missing the roller ball so applying it is quite difficult."
2,not at all what i expected.,"Shipping was very fast. However I was expecting a white musk more along the lines of the type of scent that I would find in a spray, or something at least slightly similar. Very dissatisfied with this product. It smells far too floral, like an aerosol bathroom spray. Is it too late to get a refund??"
1,Too sweet smelling..,"Luckily for me i didn't buy this frangrance for myself, i bought it for my mother-in-law who likes the smell of Almond. I don't know if she wears it..."
1,Doesn't smell like honeysuckle,"Smells are all jumbled up. It doesn't resemble honeysuckle at all. Very strong smell, it doesn't even smell floral at all."
3,Smells ok,"I really like the smell of sandalwood so I bought this perfume oil. The smells takes a while to settle, meaning, the smell softens the longer you have it on. I discovered this after putting some on my wrist, and didn't like the initial pungent odor. I kept smelling it for about a half an hour, and was pleasantly surprised how the smell had changed."
1,P.U.-trid!!!! - awful - migrane invoking,"I've never been nearly knocked out by a fragrance until smelling this one. It is SO strong, I couldn't even get it out of my olfactory sense after one small dab and then taking a shower to scrub it off. Patchoulli has always been one of my favorite scents, but this, well this is just overwhelmingly awful!"
1,not for me :S,"After reading the intriguing reviews for this product, I was expecting a wonderful new scent to try...sadly, I am VERY disappointed.I could barely detect any fragrance at all after I first rolled it on. I waited for a while, and then I applied more; however, there was no noticeable increase in the scent (actually all the second application did was give me a headache, which has gone away since I scrubbed the oil off.) I had intended to try the Amber that Auric Blends offers as well (my favorite fragrance for many years), but I am very hesitant to order it after this experience with Egyptian Goddess..."
1,Awful.,"I do like many of the other Auric blends scents, but this one is just gross. It smells cloyingly like the soap in public bathrooms--to me, anyway. Sorry, but that's my opinion!"
3,Scents are a bit on the weak side,"Purchased 5 roll-on fragrances in 1/3 oz bottle size: Majic (ok), Africian Musk (better), Forbidden Desire (ok), Egyptian Goddess (weak, not ok), Black Coconut (ok). Not particularly impressed. Too much carrier oil and not enough of the perfume scent. So, you have to use more of the fragrance (1/3 oz won't last long). The shipment was fast, was wrapped well, and the bottle/dispensers work very well. I just wish the scents were more powerful. Maybe I should try a few different scents..."
1,White Musk - Auric Blends Scented / Perfume oil,"I would love to give a great review, but I have yet to receive this product. Oh and today makes a month since I processed this order. If I ever receive it I'll be sure to rewrite this review. BTW, I only marked the rating because they wont let me post without it."
2,On sexy scent! If you're a 5th grade teacher...,"Think of the smell your Teachers had. Very Grandma-like, kind of a musky funky closet smell. That's what this is. This is that scent. The EXACT scent. Don't believe me? Buy it. One whiff and suddently.. ""Mrs. Smitherson...? I turned in my homework, I swear!""That being said, I love Auric blends and just because some of their oils are hit and miss; when it's a hit, it's a HIT!"
2,too much like a perfume,"I was expecting more of an essential oil, but it actually smells more like a perfume and not as earthy as I wanted. I wouldn't buy it again. I'll find a 100% essential oil instead."
2,Egyptian Goddeath,"I was 100% disappointed by the aroma of Egyptian Goddess. I put it on and immediately wished I hadn't. It stayed on for 3 good days, and I showered each day. I have tried to give it away, but nobody wants it. Next week it will be making it's way to the great-grandmother, maybe she will like it. To sum it up very quickly: Do not buy this scent if you are under the age of 75; it smells like old lady, exactly. Pretty much the same reason I cannot give it away.I would give 1 star, but I don't want to trash the entire Auric Blends line. Their Patchouli blend is awesome and I love that. Not sure what happened with the Egyptian Goddess, but pee-yew! I'd like to try their other scents, but now I am not sure I should stray from the patchouli."
2,Great... while it lasted,"This oil blend smelled absolutely wonderful at first, but two or three weeks after receiving and opening it went flat. Now it just smells like oil and the fragrance is barely perceptible. What a shame... I'm not sure if it was the vender, or if this is standard for this blend. Many other reviewers have the same experience.Additionally, the fragrance Night Queen that I ordered at the same time from a different vendor (I think) is wonderful. I'm not sure why Amazon won't let me place a separate review for it - so I am attaching it here:Night Queen is a wonderful oil blend. I would describe it as musky, with delicious citrus and clean floral notes. I've had it for at least 6 months and it still retains its fragrance, unlike the Egyptian Goddess that I purchased at the same time."
1,Disgusting!!,The first time I used this fragrance it made me nauseous. It had an old lady smell to it. I didn't smell any sandalwood at all. Very disappointed. I threw it away!
1,"Is this a male fragrance, being sold as female?","Ordered this product based on reviews. Wow, I was definitely wrong to do that! The order and shipping was on point, however, the the product leaves a lot to be desired. It smells like irish spring soap. I could have gone to the local family dollar to get this smell. Never again."
1,Honeysuckle? I don't think so.,"This has absolutely no honeysuckle scent to it at all. So if you are looking for that clean sweet smell, don't bother with this stuff."
2,Fancy baby powder?,"I recently ordered a small sampling of Auric Blends fragrances, and this one was a disappointment. It started out nice and smelled nice in the roller, a fresh rosy-jasmine smell. However, it quickly changed to an unpleasant nursing home smell, finally drying down to a baby powder smell. The smell is giving me a slight headache, lasting forever and I will never, ever wear this again. It might work on somebody else's chemistry, but I can't imagine many people wanting to smell like either an old lady or a baby's bottom. I love other scents by this brand (Love, Sweet Rain), but this was a miss for me."
4,Subtle and Exotic,"I wanted to comment on the reviewers who state this product has no scent- Right from the bottle, the oil is odorless, and at first I was a little dissapointed when it came in the mail. I rolled it on anyway, and let it soak in because its quite viscous, and slowly the scent started to release from my skin. The scent is subtle, if your used to spraying on a department store perfume and becoming lost in the fumes, then this is a nice surprise. Its very exotic and slightly sweet, nothing like I have smelled. Patchouli? Sandalwood? Jasmine maybe? What a treat to wear at such a great price. I can feel the African sand as I bathe beneath the Giza acropolis..."
5,Love It!,"Auric Blends are wonderful, and this scent is one of my favorites. It smells earthy yet clean. The scent lingers with you all day long and a little goes a long way, so a little dab will do you!I was thrilled to see this brand on Amazon, as I have found it difficult to find in my area."
3,"Nice, but...","This has a nice scent, but I think it smells more like a men's fragrance than a woman's. It's not feminine enough for me. It's definitely not a bad scent though. It lasts long too. I could still smell it the next morning (until I showered). It was nice the way I could smell it whenever I moved around, but it wasn't overpowering. Nice oil. I'm planning to try other Auric Blends."
2,Doesn't smell like vanilla,"I ordered this because of the other positive reviews. On my skin this smells like baby powder, and not in a good way. I put this on and when my boyfriend came home he immediately asks what that smell was. When I told him it was the perfume he said it was awful and and making him gag."
5,nice!,"It arrived really quickly. The roll on oil is very potent, so it lasts long and you dont need to use hardly any. the coconut fragrance is decadent and draws attention as my signature scent wherever I go."
2,Did not like it,"This Egyption Musk oil smells ok, I wore just a dab to work and it made me and others around me sneeze alot. Also i broke out a little with redness and itching where I applied it. So I do not suggest this to someone who thinks they may want to avoid these issues."
5,Olafactory perfection,If you are looking for the perfect lavender scent this is it. I have tried many lavender perfumes and oils and this one smells as if you are standing in a field of lavender.
5,MMMMMM!!! Amazing smell!,"First, let me say I have terrible allergies to many perfumes. This scent doesn't bother me at all!! I have several of the sample size perfume oils from Auric Blends. I love to put on a swipe of the Vanilla Sandalwood and follow it up with a much smaller swipe of the amber patchouli oil. The combined scent is evocative of Arabic Incense perfumes. Amazing, and I get compliments constantly. Its warm, and rich and deep without being overpowering or cloying. The vanilla is subtle and truly smells of vanilla, vs. the odd smell that many perfumes try to pass of as ""vanilla"" scented. All in all, I love this perfume, by itself, or mingled with other scents!"
1,Gag,If you like to smell like wet dirt then this is your scent. It smells nothing like patchouli. I had to take a shower after putting it on because it smelled so bad.
2,black coconut,"Omg this scent is a disaster. It smells like coconut for about 3 seconds and then it just bitter. I don't even know how to describe it. Is it how coconut supposed to smell like? Because it gave me headache and i had to wash it away. I don't know about other scent but I'm warning you, DO NOT purchase the black coconut, uhgg."
5,MMeeow yummy!,"I have always loved the heady, rich and intoxicating scent of Plumeria even though quite honestly florals are not my favorite fragrance type as I prefer mossy, woody, milky or musky scents.Auric Blends has been a favorite scented roll on oil based fragrance and this scent sure doesn't disappoint. The second I put it on my wrists and neck the rich buttery aroma of Hawaiian Leis envelops my senses and puts me in a good mood. This morning as I got to work I quickly dabbed some one and my new coworkers started asking what that scent was, and how good it smelled, and I sit feet away yet it bursts with luxurious bouquet of freshness. Plumeria is an incredible scent all in it's own but this oil really makes me appreciate the fine craftsmanship of true artisans of perfumery."
4,pleased to add this to my collection of favorites,"I've smelled versions of Egyptian Goddess before and they always smelled soapy or too much like a stick of incense. Based on the overall positive reviews here (and the price), I decided to try this oil. It's warm, sexy and layers nicely with some of my other perfumes (like ""Boyfriend"" by Kate Walsh). And I have been getting compliments on it (mostly by women so I'm still uncertain if it appeals to men). I do wish the fragrance lasted longer though."
2,Doesn't really smell like lavender,"I was hoping that becuase this was an oil I would get something that smelled like true lavender. Well, I was sadly disappointed when I received the item. It has hardly any notes of lavender in it and smells more like old French-milled soap. The smell isn't horrible & it lasts but it was what I had expected. I had used the vanilla and coconut oils before and they were true to their scents so I was hoping for the same on this Lavender oil."
1,Very little scent,"Great shipping, the product arrived days before the estimated date. However, I was very disappointed with the oil. I wonder if they sent me an old bottle. The roller ball to apply it was stuck, and once I was able to get the oil out, I could hardly smell anything."
2,too musty,I am still on the search for a real coconut scent... this one was too musty...not my favorite...I know that it is just a matter of personal preference...and if you are looking for a real coconut smell...this is not going to be it..
3,fine but wouldn't order a 2nd time,"this fragrance oil was purchased for my husband--we were HOPING for SANDALWOOD scent--this is awfully powdery smelling--it's nice, don't get me wrong, but it's only a HINT of sandalwood in the fragrance. I'm feeling really silly for having ordered 2. my husband does say that he likes it and he is wearing it and it mixes fine with his body chemistry, but still not what we were hoping for. next time I'll order from a local company or just go to a retail store--that way I smell the oil for myself--some things are hard to get right via ordering online only."
2,"If you're looking for old-school Patchouli, keep looking","Darn! I'm so disappointed because I really had hopes this would smell like the Patchouli of days gone by. Unfortunately, it doesn't. The oil is thick and goes on smoothly with the roller ball but I detect no Patchouli fragrance. I even tested it with my husband who absolutely adores Patchouli: I did not tell him I bought this and when it came in I applied it in several strategic locations. He did not detect the slightest hint of Patchouli! In my opinion, the bottle I received may be old because it actually has the fragrance of cardboard. Very disappointing."
2,Too man-like for me,"I thought I'd try this based on some lovely reviews, but sadly this wasn't for me. Gave me a man kinda smell. Not what I was going for. Had to toss. A little strong and headache-inducing as well. Ishall stick with their Egyptian Goddess Blend, which is soft and feminine on me."
2,"A little ""old lady"" by itself - try layering","As others have said, this scent goes on very light. The first time I applied, it was very faint and lasted a few minutes. I reapplied a few times before I got a good concentration of fragrance. It smells a little spicy, musky, a little powdery, a little floral, a bit medicinal. I think of older women when I smell this by itself.I did try layering with my everyday perfume, and it added more musk and spiciness, which I thought was lacking. I like the scent but I'm still on the fence and will need to get a second opinion later. I don't think I'll be buying this again."
1,Hippie Sweat,"I was very disappointed in this. It actually stinks. I don't smell Jasmine at all, unless Jasmine is a sweaty hippie. Gross."
2,not for me,"Ok so I received this item quickly and in good condition, kudos to shipper. But I do not care for the scent. I didn't like the smell from the bottle and neither from the back of my hand where I placed a small amount. It smells like a funeral pallor or something funky,there is a dominant scent perhaps Lilly, sorry, not for me. To be fair I will try on pulse point to see if there is an improvement, which I doubt. I will come back and update if something changes. This will be gifted to another."
2,ca sent pas bon :(,bonjour et merci pour la livraison parfaite qui est arrivee a temps :) ...sauf que le produit ne correspond pas du tout avec le musk white que je recherche et que je connais depuis que je suis petite ...j'en ai commande a 2 endroits différents pour voir la difference mais l'odeur est identique :( je suis déu !si quelqu'un peut me dire ou trouver du vrai Musk White se serai super gentil de votre part et je re-ferai un essais mais surement pas celui de Auric Blends :(
1,Stinky perfume,"Smells cheap like Irish Spring. One star for the convenient size and to carry around in purse, Cannot believe someone was on a Tova website talking about this stuff... Her father must own the company."
2,Not what I expected...,"I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately, it is just was not what I was hoping for. The scent is so light, I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything. I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch."
4,long time user,This is a sexy scent I found 12+ years ago. I love how it implants it's essence on the mind. It's truly the only perfume I enjoy wearing.
2,Very cheap and fake scent.,I was very dissipointed at how synthetic this smells.I have used divine opium incense and loved it. I assumed the perfume oil would smell as good as the incense i was wrong.
5,Magical scent,"This scent is magical beautiful and not overpowering ,I wore it and went to the mall recently I was amazed how many people approach me asking me what I was wearing what fragrance so I said it called Auric blends Egyptian Goddess they all liked it wanted to know where I bought it and I said amazon website they were all said wow ,I said you can find it there,the scent made me look like a goddess too felt like cleopatra ,thank you amazon it will be one of my favorites now."
3,Goddessy,This sort of smells like a very mild egyptian goddess to me (another of their scents which I have used for years) so I like it. It's good for being casual as opposed to being a goddess.
2,Auric Blends Patchouli Oil,I bought this for my wife. We both really liked the Patchouli scent we remembered from years ago. Unfortunately this did not measure up. It had a sharp industrial smell to it like oil used on machining tools like lathes and milling machines. Maybe if you were Tim Taylor from Tool Time you might like it. I wonder if it is just defective becuase I cannot imagine anyone really liking it.We were very disappointed.
2,Smells like aftershave . . .,I SO wanted to like this fragrance - but it smells like aftershave! Made me a bit sick to my stomach as well . . .another reviewer was right - a VERY little goes a long way. I faired a bit better with the Opium scent - but I won't be wearing it. I ordered one more: Vanilla Musk - I'm hoping I'll love that one!
3,well done for what it is,"This is exactly what college in upstate New York smells like. It's very familiar, a perfectly lovely oil and very well made; but a bit too dated for me. When you walk into a shop of essential oils or health food store, this is the scent in the air most of the time. It's not off putting, in fact it's a bit comforting. At this stage of my life however, I'd prefer to radiate a bit more modern chic and less earth mother. : ) Other than that, my package was expedited quickly and wrapped very well."
4,Unique Fragrance,"I wanted to try it because the reviews seemed positive. I love the smell! I was a little worried because it does smell more mature than what people my age normally wear (I'm 24) but it definitely has the right amount of floral and musky notes. Its not over powering but the scent lasts all day which I cannot say for my D&G; or Ralph Lauren perfumes. The essential oils in the perfume probably have something to do with the staying power and I love rubbing my wrists together because the oil gets warm and really activates the smell.I bought my bottle through Tom's Incense because Tom is an amazing seller. I've never had any qualms about ordering from him because if there's ever a problem, he's quick to respond and fix any mistakes (which I've only had one out of the many orders)."
3,Ok smell.,"I guess I was expecting a different scent. This one is strong, which is a bonus and pleasant enough, but not very musky and more of a cinnamon/vanilla smell to me."
2,lacks scent,"While I like the scent, it's just not strong enough. I don't recommend that you purchase this item. Hopefully, the manufacturer will read these comments and improve the scent's strength."
2,too weak,"I agree with the others that it does smell really good, however, the smell is so weak that i cant hardly smell it. The oil seems very thick as well and i have to rub it into my skin. I tried shaking it, but still very weak scent."
1,Was looking forward to wearing this...,"I bought this scent because of the enthusiastic reviews, and according to the manufacturer's website (Auric Blends) it's wildly popular. I bought the roll on and wanted very much to like it, but, unfortunately, this one is not for me. I was expecting a warm, powdery, floral musk and instead I get a very sharp, watery (muguet?), floral with no soft, warm musky tones at all. Unfortunately this type of scent gives me headaches. Way too much of a bite! It's too bad- I was really looking forward to wearing this scent. (maybe I got a bad bottle? or maybe it was mislabeled?) Not for me, thanks!"
2,Black Coconut Roll -On,"Doesn't smell like coconuts. Smells very synthetic, nauseatingly sweet and plasticky. Not at all how I imagined it would be. Can't recommend this one, not even for teens."
3,What's all the excitement about??,"Long lasting fragrance that didn't highly appeal to me, but is simply okay. Kind of smells like laundry detergent with florals. It is different from anything I have, and I wear it every other couple of days and when I go walking because the clean scent helps me stay motivated. It's not terrible and it's not fabulous. Not sure what all the great reviews are about. Glad it was cheap.Apply lightly, and preferable not on your arms. Because it is an oil, watch out if you have leather furniture because the oil will transfer and make a dark spot. Yep, that happened to me."
1,Smells completely different from the original scent,I have been using Egyptian Goddess for at least about 7 years and I thought I would order from amazon rather than the auric blends site because it was free shipping and a little cheaper.. So disappointed!! The scent is somehow different and even when I opened the package it had a different oiled scent as if one spilled over it? It just so happened to also smell like patchouli which I can't stand!!I will no longer order from this site for that I KNOW what it should smell like and I don't know if it's old or what but that is not the Egyptian goddess I have been getting I will spend the extra few dollars and go to the real site!
3,"Searched the term ""pheromone"" and this came up","Its a nice musky scent, but not what I was looking for, although my boyfriend says he likes it. Its a tad thick for my taste but doesnt wear off quick and the roll on bottle is great for application."
2,Icky,Should have listened to the reviewers who said this smells like baby powder and nothing like sandalwood. Won't be buying this again.
1,off...,I purchased this locally and decided to order this here because it was cheaper...I'm very disappointed ... it doesn't smell right at all..now I'm stuck with 4 bottles...I will never buy it here again.
1,Not great,"The smell is definitely not what I was hoping for. It smells horrid to me. Like baby powder and hair products, not the great smelling hair products either. It's an annoying smell that hangs around strongly all day, that smells."
2,Not for me,I bought this based on the popularity & reviews. But it's not for me. It smells like your typical scented oil at a head shop.
5,addictive,"Since the first time I bought this I've always sought it. The scent stays on your skin or cloths (I prefer on a sleeve or scarf works best), whereas regular spray perfumes do not last after a short while. When ordering, I got this from different companys, and from ordering from Auric Blends, it has a stronger sweeter smell than the other distributers, maybe because thats where it comes from, and the other ones have to get it from them and they eathor water theirs down or sell old ones. who knows. This is my fav. perfume next to E. Taylors ""passion""."
3,This is not the same as it was!,"I've used this scent on and off for over 10 years and I swear this is not the same! Maybe I got a bad batch, but the ingredient that MAKES this scent seems to be missing!?"
2,Love this one!,I don't like a lot of fruity scents but this one is really nice. I like this one alot! I meant to put 5 stars but I am just learning how to do reviews! This is a 5 Star Scent!
1,DISGUSTING Scent!!!!,"I chose to get the Egyptian Goddess since it seemed to have good reviews but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like. I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm, I smelled like an old lady all day (no offense intended). Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that!? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol. Then of course I figured it'll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists. Even then I could kind of smell it and I don't have smelling like a dog it was just that bad. When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha, I need to send this crap back. Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you don't exactly like."
1,really???,This oil has no scent at all...what a waste of money!!!! it seriously smells just like vegetable oil... i don't know what they gave me but this oil doesn't smell good or like anything at ail
2,Wrong fragrance,I ordered Night Queen fragrance and received something marked Night Queen but it is not. I have used it for years and am sorely disappointed.
3,"smells good, but doesnt last long","i bought this product mainly because of the reviews. it smells really good, but unfortunately, the smell lasts for about 5 mins after applying and thats it. thats the downside of it, i thought it'd stay on little longer."
5,Lovely!,"I love this scent! The fragrance is slightly sweet and floral with a spicy undertone. Not too strong, and lasts a long time. And the little bottle with the roller top is so easy and convenient to carry with you. Plus, you can't beat the price for an everyday scent. I will buy again!"
4,Good for the price,"This perfume is good for the low price. And very very fast shipping. I got it only two days after ordering, even before the items that I ordered the same day with prime 2-day shipping.Comes in a super convenient small bottle with rolling applicator, perfect for bringing with you and freshening up on the go. The jasmine scent isn't that strong but still smells good, with a hint of vanilla actually. Very summery. Worth buying but if you really want a strong jasmine scent I would recommend looking for a more pure jasmine essential oil. Sun's Eye Herbal Essentials offers a fantastic jasmine rose option at an extremely reasonable price."
2,Very little scent straight from the bottle,"Take the cap off and sniff, and you'll get a light whiff of this perfume. Not bad, really. But, roll it on and the scent disappears. I've used it several times and the result is the same...nothing. I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin. I am aware that an individual's personal chemistry can affect perfumes, but I expect some scent, even if different once applied. Disappointing, to say the least, and I am afraid I cannot recommend this product."
3,very weak product,So disappointed with this perfume oil. You are paying for a bottle of oil with very little scent in it. This oil is so diluted and weak. It smells amazing in the bottle but once applied the scent is gone in a couple minutes. Auric needs to really increase the scent to oil ratio. Until then I would not purchase again sadly.
3,Not what I expected,"It's ok, but I won't buy it again. It's too sweet, and kind of old-fashioned. After reading other reviews I was expecting ""sexy"" and ""skin"", but this is a sweet floral which doesn't smell sexy to me."
1,Messy half full on arrival,I'm disappointed it had leaked when it arrived & was only half full...or perhaps it had been used or something.Yikes!
3,So So,I got this just to try out and its not that bad I prefer the Love or Eygptian smell over this. Its a little to strong for me but would recommend it if you love the in your face smell.
1,terrible smell,"I don't normally give products one star, but this scent is awful. I ordered black coconut, and it smells like some horrible mix of rubber and chemicals. Maybe with a hint of coconut.So if you want to smell like a car tire that may or may not have run over a coconut, this is perfect!"
5,Very good scent!,"I really like this fragrance because it doesn't quite smell like anything else out there. It's warm yet soft, and it's a little sweet, but not too overpowering. It's good for everyday wear, which is nice."
5,So glad I ordered this (rose),"despite the negative reviews. I read many of the negative reviews and many of them were for scents other than the one I ordered. I ordered the rose and it's wonderful. It's simple, light, delicate,and smells heavenly on my wrist. I smell like I just brushed my hand through a rose garden -- lovely. I just received it, put a bit on and had to write this review right away. Some of the other scents may be iffy but I can tell you that if you like rose scents, you can order this one with confidence. Shipping was very fast and the item was well packed. I'm very pleased with this company and will order from them again."
1,This smells like a car air freshener,"This smells like a car air freshener, not a perfumed oil. I would stay away from this one if you are looking for a nice fragrance for you, unless you like to smell like that little pine tree that you see hanging from people's rear view mirrors."
1,Meh...,This fragrance was not what I was expecting. It smells too musky and just blah. My boyfriend even said I smelled like an old lady. :/ Not impressed.
2,Disappointing.,"I bought this thinking it would be as fragrant as other oils that I have used. Not so. I put a small amount of this on right after I got it, which was fast, and you could smell it for a few minutes. Then nothing. I thought maybe I didn't put enough on, so I reapplied. Same thing happened, even though I used more the second time. I emailed the company to see if it was possible to get an out dated or bad batch. They wrote back and told me that their oils aren't like other ones and you need to apply it 4-5 times to get the fragrance to last. Does anyone else see something wrong with that?! Seems ridiculous to me. Anyway, I'm not going to send it back so I guess I'll just use it when I want to smell it for a few minutes. Wish I would have known because I wouldn't have gotten it or done business with this company."
5,An Old Friend,"I have always loved this fragrance, I was unable to find it for quite a long time. Totally happy with this purchcase"
2,Too Weak,"This perfume smells wonderful, but I could only give it 2 stars because of how weak the scent is. It is very, very soft and only smellable if you put your nose right to your skin. I'd give 5 stars if Auric Blends could turn the volume up some notches on this scent."
3,Did I get a bad batch?,"I purchased this based on the reviews, and I liked the name. It was sweeter than I expected; a vanilla-cinnamon scent with a citrus undertone. It was also rather sticky, and the scent didn't last long on me."
2,Where's the musk??,"This is the third scent I have tried from this company. This one doesn't work either (for me anyway). No musk smell at all and it ends up smelling like one of those car fresheners from the 60s - no kidding, just awful. I so wanted to like it - the handy roller bottles are neat!"
4,a really cool book,"I really liked this book because it had some of the most detailed characters and settings ever. It really makes you feel like your in an Brittannia of ages past. The only thing really to complain about is that the story is not complete, in only tells a few legends, but in great detail. For example, it does not have the story of The Lady in the Lake or how King Arthur dies. However, this does not detract from the book as a whole. It portrays wonderfully Lancelots passion for Guinever and his struggle to fight against it so he too can gaze upon the Holy Grail. Overall a great read."
5,"Excelent, the best book on the topic I have ever read.","Originally I had to read this book for a Pre-IB course at the high school I attend. After reading the first few chapters, however, I found the book more enjoyable and began reading it more for fun than as an assignment. I enjoyed it so much, I re-read it just to go through the story line again. Once And Future King is perhaps THE best book ever written on the Authurian legend. This book has encouraged me to read other books about Arthur, Merlin and Camelot, both by T.H. White and by other authors. It is a highly recomendable book and it is a great way to become interested in King Arthur and the occurences at Camelot. If anyone is even somewhat interested in Arthur, this is the book to read. It is very hard to explain in words how good of a book this is so just try it and see for yourself!!"
3,I liked The Sword and the Stone better,"It seems to me that White wanders a bit, distress of mind having taken its toll. Still, the book is a classic and you can't claim to be familiar with the Arthurian Legend if you haven't read it."
4,"Once, Future, and Timeless Classic","I will not belabor all the other fine reviews here, only to state that the story is magnificent and an eternal classic. I remove one star of rating because my particular version seriously needed annotations to explain the incredibly esoteric references to British literature, historical figures, history, chivalry code, falconry, etc. I was completely lost for pages at a time while he goes on and on about ""read Mallory if you want to know more about this"", or ""the falcon's thingamajimmy got stuck in the kaboodle's bodkins"". What?"
5,The Once and Future King,"This book follows the adventures of King Arthur and those in that time including Merlyn and Morgan Le Fay...these stories are classics and are written in a classic style that is sometimes hard to understand, but are entertaining. All in all, great book...well, books...it includes more than one, including the Sword in the Stone, so don't buy that if you buy this. :)"
2,Boring,"The Once and Future King is about King Arthur and all his adventures he has. That sounds interesting to me, but not when u start to read it. T. H. White makes an interesting story very boring. Even the actions scenes are boring, like when there is the war against King Arthur by the rebels and King Lot I found my self wondering, 'wait, what is happening? Whos winning?'Also you can tell the book is really old by the style of writing. There are many misspelled words too, but I don't know if that is on purpuse because the person saying the word is pernouncing it wrong or not.Overall I think it is a terrible book, and that is saying something cause normally I like all fantasy books and espically books that take place in Medeivel Times, cause they are normally INTERESTING!"
1,One of the few books I ever truely hated.,"This is one of the most horrible books I have ever read. It is long and drawn out. Sacrificing trees for this mindless drivel should be a crime. The only slightly interesting part was the first book, The Sword and the Stone, when seeing Arthur's early years in more depth then a Disney movie would allow made me optimistic about the rest of the book. After that, absolutely nothing of importance happens. Throughout this book, I was rooting for Lancelot and Guinever to die, so maybe we could focus on Arthur, the only interesting character. The others are all shallow and uninteresting. I felt no emotional connection to any of the characters that were being focused on."
1,WARNING! DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE BORED!,When I read this book I found it to be the most boring book in the world. I could not understand what I was reading because my mind would just trail off into outerspace from sheer boredom. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE BORED! IT DESERVES LESS THAN A ONE.
1,The Worst Arthur Book Ever!,"This is, without a doubt, the worst King Arthur book I have ever read (and I have read plenty)! The characters are silly and boring. The first section tells the tale of Arthur as a child. This is probably the best part of the book, and it's not very good. The remainder of the story is pretty much Lancelot and Guinevere whining about how guilty they feel cheating Arthur, and then refusing to stop what they're doing.This might be an okay book for children -although the Lancelot/Guinevere portion is probably not suitable- but I can't imagine any adult taking pleasure in this atrocious book.For some good Arthurian literature try Marion Zimmer Bradley, Jack Whyte, Mary Stewart, etc."
3,The Once and Future King,"Wonderful, classic book, very well read. But, the CDs are mis-numbered so I'm listening to it all in somewhat scrambled fashion."
2,painful and slow,"I tried, I really tried to read this book but could only manage about 160 pages of this 600 page monster. He alludes to so much Latin, French and yer ye Olde English, it was virtually impossible for me to follow along. Many of the words he uses are not in modern dictionaries, so if you don't have a good command of English or have good reference material, TH White can leave you guessing alot of the time. Usually I can guess meanings through context clues but in this book it was much harder than usual.Of what I read, none of it flowed smoothly from chapter to chapter, it just jumped all over the place. By the time Wart was a bird for the second time, I was screaming, get on with the story!"
2,dont try to read it in one night.,"I was supposed to read this book for summer reading. I put it off, which I shouldnt have until the ngiht before. I kind of like the story...or at least what I read....but it is SO freakin hard to understand. I just didnt get it. I wish they couldve been a tidge clearer with the whole story and it would have been great."
5,The most wonderful story of all time!,"The Once and Future King is the most wonderful book I have ever read! I was forced to read it because of an assignment in school, however, I was pleasently surprised! I finished it with in a matter of days of starting it! I really got into the story and felt as though I was watching something happen right in front of me! I enjoyed the romance between Guinevere and Lancelot, the balence between gentle love, war, and justice that Arthur possessed, and the mystical adventures that Merlin took Arthur on! This was the best book that I have ever read! Next up, The book of Merlin!"
5,How I wish I was thirteen again ...,"... And able to read T. H. White's admirable rendition of the Legend of Arthur for the first time.Alas, I am only able to experience this vicariously, having given the book to my nephew some time ago. Also, alas, I fear too late, as he has wanted to follow the modern path of fast things with wheels.(But he may yet learn of the magic of Merlyn, and the mystery of the sword, Excalibur).Mr. White's rendition is at once easy to read, and deeply insightful, sometimes darkly so, taking us from Arthur as a young lad, to Arthur ruling uneasily in Camelot.Highly recommended to anyone who is young, or young at heart. Read it to your children or grandchildren, if you must."
4,read it and love it,"I first read this book when I was 13 and can honestly say it changed my life in that it made me think deeply about issues I had never previously considered. Historically it is inaccurate - if Arthur did exist it certainly would not have been in the medieval period. But this does not matter at all - White tells the story with feeling and as it builds up to a climax it is impossible to put down. It is especially good as an introduction to Malory's Morte D'Arthur, easier to read but clearly based on the text. It is the most approachable book on the legend of King Arthur I have ever read and I would recommend it highly to anyone"
5,Great Arthurian Romance,"I had to read this book in 11th grade english class. I had never read anything on the Arthurian legend before, and this book turned on an interest I never knew was there. White is an incredibly gifted writer that makes this ancient story come to life. It's good for children and adults alike!"
3,White's use of structure in The Once and Future King,"Although I have never read Le Morte D'Arthur by Sir Thomas Malory, I suspect that he did not go so overboard on author intrusion. White's novel, although certainly a good read, is often flawed by the same author intrusion that Henry Feilding used. The idea of the disappearing author is one of the mainstays of modern fiction. Also, references to modern technology do not belong in Medieval fiction. For me, these issues ruined my ""willing suspension of disbelief."" White does, however, employ an engaging style that invites you into this novel by his personal warmth and genuine compassion for his characters -- there lies his strength. King Arthur's quest to bring reason, ethics, and sanity to a barbaric world are especially gripping. That he must, in the end, face these issues alone present the novel's most powerful aspect."
1,If you're looking for the Camelot you're used to - DON'T read this!,"I'm half way through this book - it's taken me a month to get this far. I keep putting it down and reading an ENTIRE other book before picking it up again.The 1940's ""pop culture"" references in what should be a historical work are VERY out of place, and jar you out of the story when you least suspect it. The work does not flow in any way, shape or form. His way of writing makes many of the charachters sound incrdibly ignorant and simple. Also, I find the historcal timeline to contradict itself severely.I would not even consider this a good book for children, as it does not grab the attention enough, or flow well enough in my opinion. Also much of the vocabulary would be well beyond the education level of kids.For someone like me who can normally pick up the worst written books and get some pleasure out of it, I don't even know what to say about this one. Go get The Mysts of Avalon - it's a much better book."
2,Very slow moving book,"The book is kind of good, but it moves very very slowly ... there are periods when you feel like its not getting anywhere .. the literature is of course very good, but a ver slow book"
4,Once and Future King,This is a super book for anyone interested in English history during the time period of King Arthur. The character of Merlyn is so excellently portrayed you can see him in front of you as you read. I have learned many things that I did not understand from other stories because they were explained so well in this book. The only small draw back to the book is some older English words that are difficult to find definitions for.
2,Library Binding is Inferior,"The library binding edition is inferior. Small print. This is a classic, and I had purchased to be a permanent part of a young man's library, not a throwaway. However, the volume was a disappoint. Small book with very small print. Not inviting for a young reader--or anyone for that matter."
3,Not as great as hoped . . .,"I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend who really liked it - 'best book ever!'. I'm less enthused. It's about Wart, who I believe later becomes King Arthur, but I haven't read that far yet . . . I'm about a third of the way through the book. I enjoy the humor but the overall writing hasn't grabbed me. I will continue to work my way into the book, but if my interest isn't increased, I may put it aside and go on to a different book - not something I usually do, but with so many books to enjoy, I don't want to spend too much time on one that isn't working for me."
4,A reading assignment I actually enjoyed.,"My class in school was assigned to read this book. I am a particularly slow reader, so I was discouraged when I saw how long it was and the hard to understand language they used, but the more i read, the more interested I got. Although it is not one of my favorites, i really enjoyed reading this and i love the author's style of writing. You get to know the characters so much and the plot never gets too boring. New ""mini stories"" pop up in every chapter and it's always a pleasant suprise."
3,Somewhat Disappointing,"I greatly anticipated reading this books because I thought it would be a modern and humorous retelling of the King Arthur story. While White does do an excellent job of modernizing the story and keeping it readable and fun, in some ways he seems to reduce it all into a horrible joke. The story is dumbed-down way too much - the character of grown King Arthur that White creates is an idiot that I couldn't like very much, and a lot of the morals and philosophies that rightly belong in the story I don't think were handled very well. White also completely leaves out a lot of things from famous Arthurian stories that I wanted to read because I hoped the book would give a pretty thorough telling of all the classic King Arthur stuff. Lest this review sound too negative, I must say that it was still an entertaining and educating novel and certainly worth dedicating the time to read, it just did not live up to its reputation and could have been much better."
4,A Wonderful Book of Wisdom and Art,"""Might isn't Right"" is a motto that fuels the wisdom of the story as it unfolds. It begins with the story of The Sword and the Stone and wraps up with the end of King Arthur's great Camelot. Although the book is an amazing example of the wisdom of T.H. White, it is also an example of his clever sense of humor, which he uses quite often throughout this great piece of literary art. The book is quite long and drags on in a few parts, but the pros far outweigh the cons. Overall, this book is a great read and makes sense of all the other Arthurian stories you may have ever heard."
3,jyanez,"the once and future king was the best book I have yet to read that details all of King Authors life. From the time being of his childhood when he was called the wart, to having to accept the fact that he is englands true king. Trying to creat new laws and fix the damage done by his father. Enduring many obsticals as well as meeting and gaining new friends and experiences teaching him new lessons in life. The once and future king covers it all.T.H. White takes his reders on a journey only found in childhood dreams. Along the ride he engages you with talking animals, beast who roam the lands of england, and a suductive Queen whos only goal is to suduce men.A world of fantasy unfolds before you when reading the once and future king; In audition, if you enjoy reading about dragons and magicians than you are a reader of the once and future king."
3,"It's good, but boring","I read the whole book becuase I was interested in King Arthur, but I found it boring and hard to understand, but the facts are good."
3,The Once and Future King: T.H. White,Overall a good book but follows Malory too closely. Basicall not a medieval fiction novel I think it would be better classified as a medieval fantasy novel. I've read many a review saying that this is a wonderfully accurate representation of King Arthur's life and downfall. I have knews for you people. If you're looking for historical accuracy look elsewhere. This is a fairy tale. One version of the Arthurian legend that I found to be much more historically accurate is Cornwell's Warlord Chronicles. Much of the storyline is invented but the basic idea is so much more along the lines of accuracy. Personally Cornwell's version is the best I've ever read.
2,boring,"I was given this book as a summer reading assignment. I FINALLY finished it today. The book is one of the worst I've ever read. It's depth is so far over my head that i'm not sure i understand it enough to answer my review questions for school. Sadly, the only part of the book that kept my attention was the Lancelot and Gwen affair. That is the only reason i give it 2 stars. I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone under 20, unless you are patient and have a bunch of time on your hands. It's just way too confusing and boring!"
5,a great book and well worth reading,"I very highly recommend this novel. If tyou like the musical Camelot or anthing abouit, you will really enjoy this book. It's really good!"
5,Wondrous and essentially Arthurian!,"I've been in love with the Arthur legend ever since I first heard it, so naturally I was interested in this book. After I read it, it became the ultimate authority for me; I judge all other versions (including Malory's) in light of this perfect version. It brings out the characters of Guenever, Lancelot, Arthur, Mordred, and the Orkney brothers like no other version ever has. Everything makes sense and hangs together. This book is a must-read for any Arthur fan and for anyone who thinks he isn't one-- you may get a surprise!"
1,"a book full of ridiculous, messed-up jibberish!!","this book is totally boring. it is one of the WORST books i have ever read. this book was given as a summer reading book in high school and i read it in the last minute. during that time i had forced myself to read it and it was totally nothing!!!!! i can't believe that they will talk about robin hood and his crew when they're supposed to talk about wart!! ugh, i'll NEVER recommend this book to ANYONE!!! MAN!!!"
1,BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING,OMG THIS BOOK SUCKS IM FORCED TO READ THIS BOOK FOR SUMMER READING AND ITS BORING ITS GOES SO DETAILED THAT ITS REALLY SLOW. IM SORRY BUT THIS BOOK IS VERY SLOW I ONLY GIVE IT 1 STAR CAUSE THERE IS ONE PART THAT IS ACTUALLY INTERESTING....WHICH IS THE END!!!!!!!!!!!
2,The Once and Future King,"Overall, I thought that this book was full of wonderful plots and interesting storylines, but it was written in such a way that made it immensely boring. What could have been said, in great detail, within a few paragraphs, was written in a few pages -- or more!"
4,From silly to sad,"This is one of the most read fantasy takes on the Arthur legends. Very good book but odd because the first third of the book is an almost silly funny story seemingly aimed at children but quickly turns into a sad, dark tale primarily focusing on the Arthur, Lancelot, Guenevere love triangle."
3,I want more!,"I started read ""The stword in the stone"" in for school, once I finished the book I disliked it because I wanted more so now I am all most done with ""The Once and Future King"". This is what I need. But now as this book comes to and end the feeling of wanting more is coming again. I think I have falling in love with the Arthurian legend. Now I think I will move on the book that Malory written ""Morte d' Arthur"" I go to this book because I am told that it talk about the Holy Grail. But I am really enjoyed the ""The Once and Future King"" and think that if you are to read any of the 4 book inside the ""The Once and Future King"" that you should sale yourself short go ahead and read the whole book you will have all you questin answered."
2,Don't Read Too Much in One Night!,"I had to read ""Sword in the Stone"" and ""Queen of Air and Darkness"" from this book for school, but didn't have the fortune to read it over the summer. I thought that the book was okay, but my teacher gave us way too much to read each night. We had to read about 4-6 chapters a night. That's a little too much for me to digest in such a short time period. At least if I had been assigned this book over the summer, I could have read this book in a more leisurely pace. I rented ""Camelot"" before the test over the book, but it turned out to be based on the 3rd or 4th book. It did help somewhat about the lessons that Arthur learned as different animals. Now I will have at least some background information when we come back to the 2nd half of the book. This isn't a bad book, it's just that I was forced to read too much in too little a time period."
2,This was sorta flat.,"I found the parts of this book I forced myself to read stupid and very similar to ""Alice in Wonderland"" in tone and style. Robin Hood doesnt belong in stories about Arthur IMHO. This book didn't seem very serious at all, but maybe that is because I have read Mary Stewart's Merlin trilogy (which I highly recommend). Another thing I dont like about the OAFK is the description of Merlin. He seems to be portrayed as foolish and old. On the other hand, the descriptions were often good, and I could imagine what was happening."
4,Enthralling and tragic.,"This is a review of The Candle in the Wind, the fourth book in The Once and Future King pentalogy (after The Sword in the Stone, The Witch in the Wood and The Ill-Made Knight, and before The Book of Meryln).This volume tells the story of a Mordred on the onset of madness, of his attempts to overthrow his own father King Arthur out of thirst for power, and hatred for trying to drown him as a baby, by exposing Lancelot and Guenever's treason.As the story flows, Arthur slowly witnesses the fall of the Round Table, sees the work of a lifetime, his ideal of Justice, and everything he has ever fought for, collapse.The Candle in the Wind is an enthralling tragedy, ending in a wonderful speech against war, against all wars, which seem to rise again despite humanity's innumerable attempts to eradicate them. I read it avidly."
5,10 STARS!,Only my favorite book of all time. If I had to be stranded on a desert island with only one book this would be the book. I first read it as a college freshman nearly 30 years ago and have probably read it at least 15 times since then. It's one of those books I must go back and re-read at least every 2 years or so.
4,Book review,Finally this book on Kindle! Great humorous book. Cannot wait to finish it. Best version of King Arthur stories I know.
4,Great for your little soccer star,"My daughter is just learning to play soccer (age 2) and this is a good intro. It came with little cones to practice drills, but she's not interested yet. The ball is just the right size."
2,Disappointed,I thought that this product was flimsy and not quite as advertised. It blows over too easily and not very well made. Would not recommend.
3,The title says it all.,"I found this book tedious and very slow. I was anxious forit to conclude. Good enough to keep me to the end, but nothingto inspire me."
1,Is real street racing really this boring?,"Don't listen to the other reviews giving this DVD 5 stars. They must be the same people who made this or they didn't actually watch it. This was one of the most boring 90 minutes i've ever spent. The video is cheap and is always so dark that you can't even see what kind of cars are racing. Not that it matters since they are all so .... Then for 20 mintues we get to watch a cars race around a track on Japan. Wow! When the guys filming it finally find something interesting (an accident) you can't even get a good look at it because the camera is so jerky. The mostentertaining part of the DVD is the bonus footage. Which is most just girl's shaking their T&A. Avoid this DVD and buy Miscief 3000, real street racing with REAL cars."
1,Completely Worthless DVD,"This is the most worthless DVD I have ever seen. From the description you think you will see some quality street racing and all you get is lousy video shots, horrible sound and an hour of your life you wont get back again. I bought this DVD to see racing, not 10 minutes of racing and an hour of car shows and stupid staged scenes. Completely useless. Even the girls hardly made it worth watching. Dont waste your money!"
3,Alright,"Some people have given this DVD a really bad review, but its not that bad. Its pretty average as the way street racing videos go. Its at night, what do you expect you can't make out all the cars, not unless you really know cars. But you can make out whats running. The only bad thing I would say about this DVD is the moving around of the camera on a couple of instances, it can give get annoying, but what do you expect when running from the cops. Goods points are the Car show part and the race cars on the track in Japan beacause its really rare to see those races anywhere outside of Japan, and the extra bonus parts that they throw in. Its not bad, I would say that its worth adding to your collection."
1,A Slap In The Face,"I forget how much I picked this thing up for. It was a while ago...and I still remember it...because of how much it sucked. I can't believe 10 ppl gave it 5 stars.You want to know how much it sucked? I got it just as we were going on a road trip. We watched it (or attempted to) in one of the motels that we slept in, and I actually left the DVD there. Intentionally...didn't wanna see it ever again. Don't buy it, don't even download it (I don't think anybody would bother ripping it). Go to youtube and see a ton more exciting stuff."
4,For the money its a great buy!,"Ok now it wasn't the best by far, but its good and I deffinitely plan to watch it again. It had great girls, the shows it covered were ok and it wasn't too long or two short. The racing was good also. I found it entertaining and Im sure you will also."
3,IT was iight,"This is a okay movie. I got it for like 3 bucks. And its worth 3 bucks and no more. It has some pretty good races but the video quality sucks. If you want to see some real action get the 2 fast 2 real series. You get to see a wide verity of cars, bikes, girls. And real bets. But back to the point. If you just want a collection of race videos this will be an OK edition to."
1,The racing would be good if you could see it.,"If you like obstructed views, annoying effects, and horrible drivers get this video now. Here is a couple of tips for the makers of this video. First things first. Film from outside the car. If you do film from inside, don't sit in the back seat. Next is the bad editting. It's the main downfall of the video. Please learn how to edit or spend the money and get someone that actually knows what to do."
2,Not as good as it sounds.,"... Imagine a Skateboarding video with cars and that's what you get for the better part of this DVD. Most of the Races are pretty boring,go with the crowd any Sat night and you'll see the same sort of things on an empty road. There are some highlights in the extra section like the extended Japan Speedway segment, other than that if you like oogling at paintjobs I suggest you go to a car show and videotape it the result would be more entertaining."
1,WORST VIDEO EVER,"I watched the movie DRIVING MRS DASIE with my mother and it had cooler cars than the ones in this movie. It looked like the drivers stole these cars from the parking lot of the BINGO CLUB or a senior citizens house or something. I didnt see a single tank of nitrous in the whole thing. No subwoofers, no cop chases no anything a couple 25 ft long drag races that my mom probably could have one. This is the worst video ever. Anyone that gives it more than the worst rating possible only did it because they were either in the movie or because get some of the profit if it sells. I cant believe I spent any money on this piece of junk. DO NOT BUY IT, SPEND A COUPLE MORE BUCKS AND GET THE MOVIE MISCHIEF 3000. It has cars in it worth racing and it has police chases and hot frickin chicks."
1,THIS MOVIE IS A HOME MOVIE,THIS MOVIE IS STUPID I SHOULD KNOW I WAS ONE OF THE FOOLS WHO BROUGHT THIS PIECE OF TRASH DON'T LISTEN TO THE PEAPLE THAT ARE SAYING THIS MOVIE IS GREAT THE MOVIE IS A HOME VIDEO THATS ALL IT IS I SUGGEST YOU READ A REAVIEW ON A SEARCH INGINE
2,A keen grasp of the obvious,"That someone could write a book about psychology today that only cites social psychology research and makes no attempt to integrate modern neurobiological research boggles the mind.The middle section of this book can only be described as shameless filler (dozens and dozens of pages with sentences along the lines of ""we really don't need to worry so much but a lot of people still do"") designed to get the book up to publication size.The beginning was actually fairly engaging (helping to make the development in the middle all the more disappointing) and the ending had one or two helpful tips."
2,"The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Qual","The Curse of the Self: Self-Awareness, Egotism, and the Quality of Human Life is a fairly decent book about self awareness. However, I found Self- Awareness Deficits in Psychiatric Patients by Drs. Bernard Beitman and Jyotsna Nair much more useful for my purposes."
2,Adam Sandler dissapoints,"I gernerally like Adam Sandler movies but have grown wary of them,his character is someone he always tries to make the good guy who's successful but humble,always does the right thing,etc.Then there's this guy,the most irritating character he has,you've seen and heard him over the years.Not much(except the actors themselves) about this movie is good,I tried to watch it over the 24 hours it was rented for several times but lost interest,fell asleep,etc.It's a ""comedy"" but it's not that funny and the premise is ridiculous."
3,Good Movie!,"Good movie, thought it was going to better but was kind of disappointing. Sandler usually stars in better productions than this."
3,Hot for teacher lol,"Funny, but not genius. Reliable Sandler/Samburg humor, although Adam Sandler was not at his best here, and Samburg was not his usual hot, sexy socially unacceptable self."
3,decent,"I love Adam Sandler so for that, you can't go wrong. But it was not the best nor was it close to his best movie"
2,That's my what??,I thought it was to vulgar and exploiting sex. Not what I expect I have liked most of Adams movies but this one not...
2,Teenage boys will love it,"To much nudity,sex, and drinking. If I was a 15 year old boy I would love this movie, but as I was watching this with my family. I turned it off. Very inappropriate for anyone under 15...."
3,not to great,adam sandler has a horrible accent in this movie. there are some funny parts...but I wasn't impressed with it overall
4,Funny movie,If you like Adam Sandler than you will really like this movie. A ton of great lines and many funny moments. Some great 80's references.
4,Funny but over the top obscene.,The movie was funny but definitely for mature audiences only. I expected a little more from Sandberg's character. Definitely worth the rent though.
1,Does sandler think he's funny in this movie? It stunk!,Terrible.Lose the voice Adam. Nothing funny.Waste of 2 hrs.Simply stupid.Absolutely pathetic.What happened to sandler? How does this film get made?
3,Thats My Boy,"Some funny lines but mostly typical brainless Sandler, not a big fan of Adam Sandler, has grading voice. I watched it because I was out voted by my three sons on the movie to watch that day."
3,Typical Adam Sandler,I knew this movie was going to be typical Adam Sandler style so I didn't go in with any unrealistic expectations. It was funny but in a predictable way. Some of the humor was extremely tasteless but it was to be expected. I like Adam Sandler when he is in his element - comedy. It is awkward when he acts in any other genre.
2,rude comidy,lately adam sandler is getting ruder and ruder in his comidy it was so rude and abnoctious i didnt find it very funny
1,ZERO STARS,"14 Minutes in, I turned it off. Even $.99 is way too much money to spent on this movie. I'm guessing that's why the marketing team used reviews from twitter, rather than any review from a reputable newspaper or entertainment paper. In my opinion, its awful don't bother wasting your time."
1,Possibly the stupidest movie ever made,"What a total waste of time and brain cells. Adam Sandler has made some of the worst movies ever to make it onto film, but this is a new low, even for him. Possibly a thirteen-year-old boy might find this funny."
3,about what you would expect,"This is standard Adam Sandler. It's no Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. In fact, 3 stars may be a stretch. But it's reasonably entertaining. If you like Adam Sandler this movie won't be a complete waste of time."
2,Not great,"I want to like Adam Sandler movies made after 2000, but this just wasn't that good. I typically love Andy Samberg, but this movie just took everything too far to the point where it was more disturbing than funny."
1,Piece of Crap,"Wow, what happened to Standler? Jesus what a mess, he must be broke or just lazy because he has a much more ability than this piece of Crap."
1,Who thought this would be a plausible movie idea?,This movie was ridiculously bad. The idea was idiotic and it was so foul I couldn't continue to watch it. Stupid sex jokes don't make a funny movie. very disappointed in Adam Sandler
1,Awful,Just awful. Only reason worth watching is to look at Leighton Meester. Will Sandler ever make a funny movie again?
2,Funny at times,I rented this movie through my roku box because I was bored. The movie had its funny moments but fell flat and dragged through most of the movie.If you are a Sandler fan you may enjoy it more that I did.LS
1,Terrible!,This movie was painful. There were a few (very few) amusing moments but I would recommend saving your time and money!
5,Very Funny!!,Very Funny!! This is a must see movie!! Adam Sandler is an awesome actor here. Very Funny!! This is a must see movie!! Adam Sandler is an awesome actor here.
1,"movie that turns REAL problems into ""everyday occurences""","seriously I love adam sandler and andy samburg. but this movie was trying to do too much for a laugh. I literally threw up watching this movie.i'm pretty open minded and easygoing but they downplayed a lot of things that cause VERY. BIG. issues in real life. (these may be spoiler alerts so if you want to see it don't read on) but shooting at the public, molestation, AND incest. if you don't have a story or screenplay don't do all this stuff to get a reaction. it's sad and even sadder that people would make a movie like this like these problems don't actually exist."
1,TRASH!,"Where do I start? This movie is so stupid it makes you wonder do they know what real comdey is?! This isn't funny in the least. It uses the F- word throughout like water. I have a few f words myself for this turkey. Flop, Foolish, Failure of a dumb movie. What was also upsetting is that they had a 3 or 4 yearold holding himself in the movie. I never been a fan of Adam Sandlers and after watching this garbage I don't think I will ever be. Do actors or actress read scripts before taking a role or they just desparte. I got to see this movie for free and I want my money back that should tell you something. Don't ever buy this trash of a movie unless you feel like you been bad and you need to be punished."
1,"Raunchy, nasty, not funny",Haven't ever been a Adam Sandler fan. Only have found one of his movies to be funny. This was a new low for him. Discussing and not funny.... Don't waste your time!!
4,Funny Movie tipical Adam Sandler,"Not his best commedy was a little forced, but was worth the price of the movie, won't win any academy awards, good story line though."
3,Funny but not hilarious,I thought this movie was funny. It had it's moments especially if you're an Adam Sandler fan. It wasn't a memorable movie however and I don't quote it with my friends like other Sandler movies.
1,Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,There is nothing funny about this movie. The writing is so bad and Adam Sandler pretty much yells with his voice the entire time. I was incredibly disappointed.
1,Really?,It's like they weren't even trying. Watch hot rod or billy Madison instead. There is no point in even pretending there was a plot but even the jokes were just not funny. Disappointed.
5,That's My Boy,"Loved it! I laughed just as hard as I did when I watched Grandma's Boy. Although, the latter is still one of my favorite Happy Madison productions so far. This was pretty damn funny!"
3,Not as bad as I thought,Alright most recent Adam Sandler videos have been pretty bad. This movie his character is pretty bad but Sandberg makes up for it with his performance. Sandler must feel like his crazy voice is what makes him a good character but I would like to see the old Sandler back for a few movies.
1,Shameful,This movie is awful!!! There is nothing funny concerning this very serious topic! Movies like this should not be allowed!!! Amazon should band this movie!
1,Horrible movie...,"This movie was absolutely horrible. It is the sick, twisted type movie filled with disgusting filthy language of which I found nothing but disgust."
4,Funny movie,Enjoyable and funny. I loved Vanilla Ice in this movie! He should do more. This movie was also kind of touching as it showed the father-son relationship and how important it is.
3,funny stupid movie,i laughed a lot in this movie. It's a funny stupid movie with dirty sense of humor . but way better then zohan the movie with adam in it.
3,True to Sandler style - spirited and funny-silly,Its like mind candy to watch such a show. But sometimes you need some chocolate and this movie will fit the bill
3,Surprisingly entertaining!,"I've seen pretty much every Adam Sandler movie (been watching him since SNL days) someway or another - truthfully, I mostly wait until things come out on cable. My husband and his friend rented this while I was at work, so I watched it later (I never waste a rental). Some gross out humor involved, that's for sure! Good for a rainy day."
1,Sandler should retire!,"Alright I will keep this short and sweet, not only is Sandler tarnishing his reputation as a comedian but also at the box office.His last 5 to 10 movies have been awful, either kiddie movies or garbage like this one. He acts like if he was back in his 20's but he is just damaging his persona doing stupid movies. His career is going down the fish bowl of crap with hollow roles like these."
3,Only if you are san Adam Sandler fan.,"Ok... this is one of those movies I could have gone a lifetime without seeing. The story line was okay... the dialog was horrible. It's what I call a classic SNL ""B"" movie. If you are an adam sandler fan...I think you will like it. Otherwise, put this movie on the shelf you plan to watch when there is nothing better on :)"
1,How Bad Can It Get,"Vulgar,filthy garbage without a single laugh. Adam Sandler has sunk to a new low in his cruel humorless brand of what he thinks is humor. Too bad I can't give it zero stars."
1,Ridiculous,Words cannot describe how utterly pathetic and revolting this movie is.So what does that say about me that I actually watched the whole thing?!AVOID
4,poctorhills,This item was shipped and received on time with no damage. This item is a christmas present for my daughter.
3,Same old Adam Sandler,"This movie was just OK. It is basically exactly the same humor as all of the old Adam Sandler movies. If you are in the mood for a trip down memory lane with the same types of stuff as the old Sandler greats, go for it. Just don't expect too much."
3,Not as bad as we expected,"It was not as bad as Jack and Jill... Not as good as Billy Madison. We were not expecting a blockbuster hit, but we were pleasantly surprised that we didn't hate it."
1,"Awful , Horrible, DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS!!!!",Hands down one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Do not waste your time or money on this. Sandler really dropped the ball on this awful movie. It actually offended me that he made such a terrible film and put it out there in public
2,DUMB,"I don't know why i decided to watch this maybe because it was only 0.99 .Sandler's take on the whole Mary Kay Letourno thing and the Hasbeen child celebrity thing. not funny ,not clever but I guess that is what is to be expected from Adam Sandler. He must be doing something right -he's rich! Glad I only spent 0.99 and not the $10 or more for the theatre"
2,Stupid,"I usually like Adam Sandler movies and thought this would be a much funnier movie. Adam Sandler is annoying in this movie, there is really nothing likable about him at all. I will never watch this movie again and would not recommend it to a friend. I was a waste of time."
1,Sandler sucks ....,"Just horrible , there is nothing good to say. Was thinking about quitting midway but watched the whole thing as I paid for it, even though it was only 99 cents , I guess that's the only good thing about it."
1,yeesh,"The movie was typically schticky bad Sandler guilty pleasure until the end when it just got plain WRONG. I'm all for a crappy Sandler movie, it is comforting like Kraft Mac & Cheese, but this one pushed the envelope too far and if I could take stars away I would. Don't bother watching this. Just re-watch The Wedding Singer, the heyday of Sandler doing good in a bad wig, and pretend you don't know this one exists."
5,"""THAT'S MY BOY"" movie review","my review for ""THAT'S MY BOY"" the whole cast in this movie was funny but Adam Sandler was THE BEST in this movie! i encourage anyone who likes comedys to watch this movie!!!"
2,Stupid,But I may be biased because I can't stand Adam Sandler. My son wanted me to watch it with him. The most I could do was endure.
1,Didn't even finish the movie,I thought it was terrible. It wasn't funny and I typically like Adam. It was a good storyline idea but so poorly done. Waste of my time and money.
2,Ridiculous amount of cursing,This movie would have been so much better if Adam Sandler cut out 50% of the curse words. I'm a huge fan of his so I was surprised with all the unnecessary vulgarity.
5,sometimes stupid funny can be great,"I feel sad for the people who did not like this movie. I thought its pretty funny so far, Just what i needed. yeah its kinda stupid but sometimes we forget to laugh at the stupid things in life. Its not a movie for familys though and thats sure to keep in mind (leave the kids out of the room) but if you have had a rough week and just need to turn off your brain just a little bit for some cheap laughs this is a good movie to watch. :-)"
1,Don't bother.,I love many of Adam Sandler's movies but this one was too horrible to watch. There were one or two funny moments but for the most part it was just a lot of humor that only an immature teen age boy would like.
1,HORRIBLE MOVIE!,"This movie was terrible. Not funny at all and the raunch that was in there wasn't even funny, just sick and stupid! Even my teenage boys who laugh at everything said this movie was ""god-awful"" and got up and left."
1,Wish I could give no stars at all...,"I usually find Adam Sandler pretty funny but this movie was completely disgusting. The language was just too much, completely inappropriate and gross. In addition to the whole thing not even being filmed to seem realistic. I can honestly say that there wasn't a single scene that I genuinely enjoyed. This is completely trashy garbage. Don't waste your money."
1,BOOOOOO TRASH,"This was so gross I could not even get passed the language. I am so upset I wasted my money on this. It was gross, the language was horrid, everything about it was trash. Poor waste of time."
5,Hilarious!!!,"All you people need to stop being so uptight!!! I laughed the entire time, I thought it was a classic adam sandler production. People need to lighten up and stop taking everything so damn personal!"
3,some decent laughs,average overall with some funny parts. Not great but not terrible. Worth watching if you aren't expecting too much out of it.
4,Funny as usual...,"It was a funny movie, had some funny lines. Not my favorite Adam Sandler film but I'd watch it again."
3,It was OK.,"Adam can be funny. The Old stars like V-ICe and the guy from different strokes, made great cameos. Some funny moments, some over the top cheese, but it was entertaining. Not as funny as I hoped. Yet I did not regret the rental. Just OK."
3,Just ok,This is just ok. Typical funny dumb movie that is good to watch once but no good story line to it.
4,Adam Sandler,"You have to be a fan of Adam Sandler to like this movie. He always goes back to the eighties. I do think it's funny, but as always, some far fetched things."
4,Not Sandlers Best,This is a very funny movie. However there were some flaws. At times it was too vulgar. Others the jokes didn't work. In the end I liked it.
1,Not Worth the Time!,I can't believe we made it through this whole movie. If you like extreme raunchiness then you might enjoy this film!!
4,Not one of Sandler's best movies but still pretty good,"a decent movie, lots of funny parts and foul language, Adam Sandler is struggling to find his nitch in some of his new films.. but still a pretty good film."
3,typical Adam Sandler,This is not Sandlers best movie but there is some pretty funny stuff in this movie... I would say entertaining for sure
2,Just more punch line happy Adam Sandler movie,"This is just another Adam Sandler movie. Great for wasting a morning while being lazy, but not worth much more."
3,Slightly better than typical Sandler movie,Adam Sandler movie with typical crazy jokes. If you want to turn you brain off and have a couple laughs its worth 2hr of your life
3,Adam Sandler needs a new role...,"Like most of Sandler's movies, this one is pretty much the same. Immature roles with immature puns that are meant to be funny. I did find myself laughing at a few parts but got tired of Sandler's voice, which is much similar to his character's voice in Little Nicky. All in all it was okay. Nothing worth spending 2.99 on but thankfully I got it for only 0.99 on Amazon Now."
3,That's My Boy (2012),"Funny movie. Definitely a typical Adam Sandler movie. The movie rating is R, so I would not recommend it for anyone that is offended with swear words."
1,adam sandler biting dust...,Streaming was perfect but movie was incredibly boring. Sandler's humor at its worst. Waste of time. Don't watch this movie. You'll be taking a great decision.
2,That's My Boy.,"Complete stupidity in most scenes. Nonsense in most cases. Strains and stretches for a laugh that took this movie over the cliff for me. Its seemed and felt like the producers on this film, have reached their limits on comedy."
2,Typical,"I knew this would not be an Oscar-worthy movie, but it was even goofier and raunchier than I expected from a typical Adam Sandler movie."
5,Laugh out loud... If... Your an Adam Sandler fan!,"My wife nad I both loved this film. I would say however that we are both Adam Sandler fans. My wife made note that if you're not an Adam Sandler fan, you will not like this movie at all as it's typical Adam Sandler shock humor. Hilarious in my opinion."
2,Pretty Bad,I expected a lot more out of these two but overall it was pretty bad film. Hope to see Sandberg it better roles and films in the future.
1,Washed up,I think this movie would have been fine if it was earlier in his career. But the ronch coupled with the lack of rich humor made this the worst Adam sandler movie ever. Just yuckie
1,Zzzzzz,Worst. Flick. Ever. Adam Sandler's early stuff was pretty good. This is drivel. Don't waste your time. You'll never gt it back...
2,"Sorry, Thumbs down on this one",What a shame that the industry spoils what would be a good comedy byputting in all the curse words. Do people really talk like that???This one has so much had to shut it down.....I don't understand this when your biggest movie sales is those that aren't loaded down with swearing.Wise up Hollywood:(
2,Average at best,This movie might have made me laugh more if I was 16 but at 32 not so much. It had its moments but it was a little over the top.
1,I want my money back,"I usually like Sandler stuff, but this movie was a real stinker. Not only was the subject matter offensive and could have been funny, it was not. He reminds me of a little kid who says shocking words to get attention. Acting is bad, formula like, even the racy scenes were predictable teenager. It needs a warning label on this one,."
2,funny,this movie was just one of those movies that is good to pass the time. My son wanted to watch it so we did. I did enjoy it but it's not very high on my list.
3,A movie to fill some time.,This is not a movie I would watch again. Sophomoric at best with very funny people but it was something I had to quit watching and then come back to it.
4,cute,That's My Boy (2012)Adam Sandler.........typical brainless but with watching...great price on amazon as always. Worth watching more than once
3,Better than I thought,"If you can get past Adam Sandlers annoying voice, then the movie is okay. I almost turned it off after 10 minutes, but because I paid for it I thought I would stick it out a little longer. I'm glad I did. It's funny typical Adam Sandlers style."
2,What you would expect from an Adam Sandler movie.,"This movie was funny sometimes but (spoiler alert) there were things that happened in the movie that were purely self indulgence for Sandler. He becomes famous as a child for sleeping with his teacher? In what reality would that ever happen? And as a gross looking adult he's irresistible to all women? Oh well, whatever it's a fantasy comedy were Adam Sandler is amazing and by comparison Andy Samberg is the total opposite. If you like Sandler no matter what then this will be another great film to watch as part of his collection of films."
2,Great cast - Not what you expect.,"The cast is such a great line up of amazing comedians. Especially Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg! So I was expecting great things in a collaboration from the two but it really was just an ok movie. There might have been 1 or 2 scenes that got alot of laughs, but the rest was just so - so. Maybe my expectations were too high, but this really wasn't too great and I wouldn't want to watch it again."
2,old jokes and predicted story,"I rented it as the story sounded like it holds a lot of comedy, I was disappointed, I couldn't find laughs in the movie, everything was way too predicted, and it feels like I've seen it before"
2,Thats My Boy Movie Review,"Another hum-drum movie starring Adam Sandler. The last really funny movie Adam starred in was Water Boy. This movie just wasnt that funny. As usual it wonders through a parady of someone who grew up in the 80s and how silly they are, just not silly enough. I found this character to be one of his worst."
2,Thats my boy,"It wasnt all that funny, this is the worst adam sandler preformace. His other movies were great and funny. Just not this one."
2,"Silly voiced, throw-away Sandler can't even win over old fans.","Like a lot of folks that saw this movie, I grew up with and love Sandler's classics. The childish jokes and physical humor with lots of screaming always gets me in the funny bone, unfortunately there is none of that in this movie except maybe 1 or 2 moments for a total of 12 seconds.If you've been on the fence about watching this movie and are a fan of Sandler, I darn near guarantee you'll grab your laptop half way through this movie to check email or Facebook because you are just barely paying attention and waiting to laugh.This is one of those comedies that tries to have a soul (ala Just Go With It) but is unfortunately written so flat that the ""soul"" doesn't carry it and you just sit around waiting to laugh and it doesn't happen."
2,Disappointed,"Great actors, but the movie sucked. So much more could have been done with it. My family and I are huge fans of both stars, but it was awful."
2,Sandler bottoms out,"First I want to say that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I think he's a very talented guy, but this one seemed like an attempt by Adam Sandler to see how extreme he could be. I like sick, off-the-wall humor until it becomes the whole premise of the movie. He's always had some of that in his movies, but this was ridiculous. It's almost like he was trying to see how many offenseive and perverse topics he could jam into one film for shock effect. A few funny moments, but all in all, very disappointing."
2,Sandler's cashing a check; cant blame him,"I normally enjoy Adam Sandler's movies, including his recently panned ""Jack & Jill"", but ""That's my Boy"" was quite horrible. There were few funny scenes and the whole thing just felt like little thought went into it. Not much else to say about this film."
2,It's not 1996 anymore,"Adam Sandler (Happy Madison Productions) tries the same routine from his older movies and it comes across tired. I was looking for a light hearted movie to relax after a long day, and i found that i preferred sleeping to watching the end of this movie."
1,Poor Movie Choice,extremely raunchy movie. I watched the trailer but didn't realize how many F words would be in it. It was poor quality.
2,Sandler Movies,"Normally I love adam sandler movies. But, the language was absolutely awful in this movie in particular. Needs to make cleaner language movies."
1,I decided long ago to see every Adam Sandler movie for a chuckle. This was just way to icky,This would have been rated X only 5 years ago. The humor could have carried the day without the 8th grade boy humor.
1,Bad...worst Adam Sandler movie ever,I think this movie should be banned..disgusting....I thought be cause Adam Sandler was there it could be a good movie but jeez its bad...quit making movies this kind ...I hate this one...
1,Disgusting movie,It's not funny and no morals. I don't recommend to any body.What a waste. I think Amazon should remove this movie from their list.
1,Filthy language,We couldn't watch it because of the filthy language. Totally inappropriate for familyviewing. Why can't Hollywood get it right?
1,Meh.,This movie was just very....meh. There was nothing really funny and it kind of dragged on. The whole brother/sister incest thing was weird too.
1,Terribly bad movie!,"This may be the worst Adam Sandler movie that he has ever done, and he mas made some whoppers in the past - e.h. Zohan. Skip this movie if you would rather not feel stupid for wasting time."
5,Almost as funny as Happy Gilmore,If you loved happy gilmore or water boy then you will love this one. His old comedy style is back and hella funny!
1,Excessive foul language no savior for weak script.,We wasted $4.00 renting this movie. Nothing like Waterboy or Happy Gilmore. Crude humor which may appeal to a 13 year old boy. Weak script - we turned it off after 15 minutes. Wish I could have those 15 minutes back! No more Adam Sandler for us. Very disappointed.
3,Not my kind of movie,"I thought it was okay, I like funny movies and this one was just okay. I think it would be more for a young crowd, they might enjoy it more. I do love Adam Sandler!"
3,It was alright.,"Andy Samberg is great,but Adam Sandler and that stupid voice he does is annoying. The movie was a little predictable. It did have some funny parts. I'd probably watch it again."
3,So-So,"It seemed to me like a typical Sandler performance. Overall, I would recommend this movie to others but, I just wasn't terribly impressed."
3,Not Sandler's best,It had a few funny parts but I was very disapointed not his best work by far......I was expecting allot more from a sandler film...
1,stupid,"we rented this show without knowing anything about it. we figured it would be a good comedy because adam sandler is in it. a teacher has an illegal relationship with a 12 year old, is not funny. and how he swears and acts during the movie is not funny."
1,That's my boy,I am a Adam Sandler fan. his movies are usually funny and have an endearing quality. this movie is neither. I did not finish watching the movie it was almost painful. even his twin movie was funnier than this .
3,Not Adam Sandlers best work....,"One of my favorite actors, I enjoy most all of his movies...But this is not Adam Sandlers best work. Crass, vulgar and tasteless. I would not recommend it."
3,Thats my boy,Pretty funny but kind of corny. I would recommend this film to my friends. Just to rent not to buy.
2,Predictable,Not as funny as other Adam Sandler movies and most of the jokes were mediocre and the plot was predictable.
3,"Funny in spots, stupid in others.","I know Adam Sandler movies are supposed to be stupid-funny, and some of the scenes had me rolling. However, there were some really stupid scenes that were just ridiculous, which made it overly stupid. I think the concept was pretty funny and it followed the typical Adam Sandler plot: crazy guy, does something dumb, becomes a star, messes up with the costar, makes up for it, happy ending."
3,OK,"This movie was okay. Not one of Adam Sandlers best. I am a fan of his, but this one lacks something."
4,Funny Show!,This was way better than I expected it to be. I enjoyed it very much and ordering was very easy.
3,Sandler does it again,It's funny if you like Adam Sandler's formula for his movies. I can't ever tired of it. # # #
1,VULGAR,I was very disappointed with this movie. I have a very crude sense of humor and tend to find cheesy movies funny BUT this movie was horrible. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Don't waste your time.
2,bad movie,Not that funny and a lot of swearing. I expected it to be better. He has much better movies than this one.
2,wasnt impressed at all,Im a big Adam Sandler fan but this is not one of his best. The plot wasnt horrible but thats about it.
4,"Hope t works, tired of the pain",I bought this based on comments on the Internet about DLPA stopping the pain. I have suffered for over 12 years. Praying this works.
3,Disappointed,"I picked up this book because of Richard A Knaak who had written many good novels. However, I was disappointed with this book, because the characters are not really well developed. Each had a very simple 'script' that reads like a computer role-playing game. The evil Ganth just alternates between ""Bwahahaha..I'm so evil"" and ""The shard! I MUST have the Shard! "". The lead characters Jarric and Ferlyn are you atypical good-guy-hero. Maybe another interesting character might be the seductive vampiress-turned-good. All-in-all, this book reads rather like a computer game. Entertaining enough, but not epic material. I guess I might be too picky with a one-volume book, but I still can't help being disappointed."
3,"Devotional by a life coach, not a how-to guide","Laurie Beth Jones is a prominent figure in life coaching circles. This particular book is a good daily devotional for women, particularly businesswomen, from a coaching perspective.Although the title talks about learning coaching from Jesus, the book really doesn't focus on learning how to coach--hence the three stars. If you are new to coaching or looking for a Christian coaching how-to,Coaching for Christian Leaders: A Practical Guide (TCP Leadership Series)or myLeadership Coaching: The Disciplines, Skills, and Heart of a Christian Coachfocus more on practical tools, skills and models. I did really likeThe Path: Creating Your Mission Statement for Work and for Lifeby Jones--it has some excellent handles on creating life mission and value statements, and has more of a balance of practical tools and stories."
4,good for a bible study,at the end of each chapter the author asks several questions that really make you think . Ienjoyed it and I enjoyed Jesus CEO written along the same line.
2,Missing Number of Mixes,"I ordered this CD single because the website listed nine mixes that would appear on it. When I received it, it only had six mixes. Out of the six mixes, I only liked one, ""Mood 2 Swing Radio Mix"". I wish this CD single had ""Mood 2 Swing Extended Vocal Mix"" which is 12:00 that I would really enjoy. I felt deceived because the website's quanity of mixes that would appear on this CD single is different from the actual quanity of mixes that appeared on my order."
3,"Great, But.......","Where are all the tracks? The best one is missing. (Mood II Swing Vocal). Otherwise, classic."
5,Two Times The Charm ...,"Book Description: He's something of a catch you know. Eloise was told about the handsome Dr. Timon van Zeilst. ""But no one's caught him yet."" Eloise felt quite sure that it wouldn't be her. Why should he look twice at a plain English nurse with the beautiful Liske around? And Liske had claimed she was destined to be his wife. It was no good telling herself not to care, because she did -- even if he was the most infuriating man she'd ever met!This Neel story involves a Plain Kind Hardworking British Nurse and a Rich Handsome Dutch Doctor with the mean, spiteful girlfriend to add drama; the illness dealt with is cancer. I passed on this book after reading the reviews; purchased and read it with an over-critical view, but liked it. I re-read it later, liked it much more, and found it to be an enjoyable Neels read."
2,"The plot is well written, but the ending........","When I finished, I reread the ending to see if I was missing something. The story fell through a hole into the ending. I am thinking: ""what happened? wasn't she...? isn't he...? what about....? "" and all I have is THE END.Don't get me wrong, a person can really relate with her and her problem, but they seem unsolved."
2,Ehhh... not what I was after,"Interesting read... but it's more of an information paper than anything else. You will learn a FEW strategies for when you're interrogated, but not enough to make the book worth what most people are charging. I was expecting more of a ""textbook"" than an ""informational paper"" when I made this purchase.If you're interested in educating yourself on the psychology of and better resisting interrogation, this isn't the book for you.Why two stars - it is an entertaining read and it is a very good informational paper.I can save you the money and sum it up - ""Don't say a damn thing."" Book complete. I paid WAY too much for this book."
1,Save your money-go with a different backpacking stove,I bought this stove only to realize that you cannont buy gas for it in this country. I went to camping stores to see if any other brands of gas canisters would be compatible with this device and they are not so I have to return this thing.
1,"No kung-fu , just Fuuuuu!!","Ok, this one is weird. I get the feeling they cut out some of this film for ratings purposes perhaps, seems like when something steamy was going to happen there was a splice in the copy. Basically a pointless story about a disturbed woman who lures unsuspecting goofball samauri into her bedchamber then kills them the next morning. We dont get to see the alleged sex, we barely see the alleged killing, and the fight scenes ( what few there are) are actually spliced together to make the moves appear lightening fast (as they may be if anyone on the film had any actual martial arts skills). HONEST, the fight scenes look like something my little brother and I did with our first VHS camcorder when we were kids!!!ONE POSITIVE NOTE, for fans of goofy dialogue and bad dubbing, there is plenty to laugh at here but don't pay more than 2 dollars for this one!!"
3,Good but not great. Kinda dull,"Hey, the link someone else provided is not working. I think they changed it. [...]As far as the Chosen Rejects book, it's okay, but not great. I don't know if its a rehash of come As You are because I didn't read that one yet."
1,"The Rome story, straight from the horse's mouth","Mary Ann, you're making up things. Kurt Cobain was suicidal, and tried to end his life in Rome. There's no disputing these facts. Dr. Osvaldo Galletta, the actual doctor who pumped Kurt's stomach in Rome and saved his life, knew Cobain was flight risk, and gave him a hospital room with no windows because of it. He knew Cobain was nothing more than a charming junkie from the moment he spotted his veins and heard Cobain speak after he was saved from his coma. Dr. Galletta also said that saving Cobain's life was a waste, which was so funny yet so true. Now THERE'S some brutal honesty for ya.And here's the link, Mary Ann. Lose the denial:http://www.charlesrollins.com/music/kurtod.htm"
4,Interesting Collection Of Tales,"This collection of vampire tales was, on the whole, quite good but had a couple of duds. It seemed that after the first 100 pages the stories got much better. I particularly liked ""Voice From The Void"", ""Death Mask"" and ""Faith Like Wine"". These were great stories. ""The Ghost Of St. Marks"" didn't interest me much. It was confusing - what was the relationship between Father Brian Stuart and David? It seemed like the author was trying to hint that they were gay, but you were left wondering what was the true relationship between them? I don't know; I just didn't get that one.Overall, a good collection of stories."
4,Errr...wow,"My first foray into the dark and terrifying world of slave exploitation pulp fiction and what a surprisingly entertaining read. Like all exploitation, it wallows in the very bigotry it claims to denounce and so includes countless references to big bull n--s, mullato whores, and halfcaste darkies, while perpetuating every racial stereotype ever conceived. And yet once the reader overcomes the initial shock, the story is actually pretty good. Set in the 1790s, a rugged womanizer inherits a plantation in St. Domingue/Haiti and finds himself playing a major roll in the island's revolutionary war of freedom and independence. Featuring several real life individuals (Henry Christophe and Toussaint Louverture among them), the book is actually quite well written and for all its sensational use of racism, sex, and torture, is highly entertaining while offering some pretty sound factual information regarding the war."
5,Newberry Honor book that is beloved by horse-fans,"Beloved for 50 years, Misty of Chincoteage is a fast-paced horse story. Despite it's age, Misty is a timeless classic, appealing to today's young horse-lovers. Having seen the wild stallions featured in the book, first hand, this reviewer can testify that the book truly does capture all the excitement of seeing these beautiful wild stallions. This book is easy reading with charming illustrations. It makes an excellent bedtime chapter book. Start your collection of Marguerite Henry books with the Newberry Honor winner, Misty of Chincoteage"
5,misty of chincoteague,"I couldn't find this anywhere for my granddaughter, who loves to visit Chincoteague and Assateague. Once I got this from you, my daughter-in-law reads a chapter everynight to to her, and it is a lovely experience for both of them!"
5,My daughter loved it!,"We got this book for our 7 year old daughter for Christmas. She's a good reader and loves horses. She read this book to herself in three days and loved it! She told us she now knew how to ""talk like a horseman!"" We can always tell when she loves a book because she gets emotionally wrapped up in the story and tells us all of the drama. This book seemed to make quite an impression on her. I haven't read it myself, but can say that my daughter fell in love with it."
4,Misty of Chincoteague review,This was a good book and and I looked if there was a next one of this book and there is so I'm gonna read it soon.
5,I love it!,Maureen and Paul are at the grounds and a storm comes. Grandpa takes Maureen home and tells Paul to stay and if the storm gets too bad then to go to his truck. then the rain started pouring down. So Paul jumped into the big coral to find Misty and the Phantom and take them to the truck. He couldn't find them because his grandpa already put them in the truck. Paul fell asleep and Misty fell asliip on his lap. The next morning Pauls grandpa went out and got him. Paul and Maureen get Misty and the Phantom and learns to ride Phantom bareback. Sally
1,false advertising,"Book was advertised as hard-bound in very good condition. Book received was paperback in poor condition. This was very disappointing, as I intended the book as a gift for a young boy after describing to him that I had known Grandpa Beebe, a central character in the book. I did receive a refund of my payment and the seller chose not to pay for return of the mis-advertised item."
5,"Good! No, Great! No, Exellent!","This book is one of my favorite books! Maurgite Henry makes thestory seem so real, so real that it feels like you are in the story!And if you like adventure, and if you love horses......... THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!"
1,"Great book, horrible edition",Misty is a wonderful book with beautiful illustrations by Wesley Dennis. This paperback edition is horrible - far too small. The paper is terrible quality. The pictures are barely visible. Even the print is too small.Better to get it second-hand or from the library.
4,"New Reader, pleasant surprise","I appreciate reviews written by people who have a childhood memory of a book and a deep commitment to passing on their love of the book. I've certainly gone that way in a few reviews. But, I'm not sure how helpful those reviews are to someone thinking now about buying that book now for a child to read now.I just read this for the first time because I'm actually trying to read all of the books I'm putting in the kids' library. There have been lots of pleasant surprises, (say, ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"", go figure), and some surprising disappointments, (""The Great Brain"").Well, put Misty in the happy surprise category. This book is neither dated nor old-fashioned, and is actually a book that I could see a young reader enjoying and taking to heart. So, if you're on the fence this book is certainly worth considering."
5,Misty,"Best book in the world for eight to 12 year old girls... loved it as a kid... my granddaughter will get it as a birthday present and since she is in love with horses, will be delighted. The edition I received was as advertised. Thanks!"
5,Misty,Great story and a great gift for our little horse loving granddaughter. So easy and economical to shop on Amazon.
4,Misty of Chincoteague,"Paul and Maureen are two kids who want to catch the Phantom, a pony who is too hard to catch, and hasen't been caught for three years. Paul had just found out that the Phantom has a new born colt named Misty. Paul and Maureen have to raise enough money to buy Phantom and Misty because at the end of Pony Penning Day they sell all the ponies, and what ever ones don't get sold they but back to the wild. Paul and Maureen raised $102. Luckily when Pony Penning Day came, Paul caught the Phantom and Misty. ""NO! , somebody has baught Phantom and Misty,"" cried Maureen to Paul. Paul wants to find out who baught Phantom and Misty and see if they can buy them back. Will Paul ever find out who bought the Phantom and Misty? Will they ever get Phantom. Do you like stories about horses or ponies? If you do, you will like this story. I think this book was really good."
3,A little too misty,"This great old classic story came in a cheesy ""hardcover"" version. Even though it was hardcover, the pages were cheap newsprint and the book was smaller size than the original we first enjoyed in the 1950's."
5,Chincoteague Misty,"I have read this book over and over again! It is one of the best books around. I have seen misty (stuffed) at the BeBe ranch in chincoteague. Also my pony loves to hear the story, too! Shamrock, (my pony) is a real chincoteague! You learn a lot about chincoteagues and it is fun to read. Sea Staris all so a great book. I have done a book report on Misty.Misty was a fun fulled little foal and a beloved horse. almost all horse people know about misty and Sea star, so you shouldtoo!"
5,just what the doctor ordered,"i am a addict living in recovery,thought i'd have to give up model building,glad i found this,wish i could find a way to let everyone (which there are many)with my same needs to know about it"
1,Poor quality and cut by about 7 minutes,"This release is most likely mastered from VHS, it looks washed out and is not very sharp. Also the film runs 86:26 NTSC. The british DVD, issued under the title ""Dragon Warrior"" by Pegasus runs 93.42 PAL. The picture quality on the british release is also not perfect though."
5,A must read!!,"Robert Wolfe's Playing With Fish is a must read! This beautifully written collection of essays is seamlessly tied together through the sensitive, thoughtful, and entertaining voice of the author. Reminiscent of Edward Abbey's works, this book discusses the profound connections and relations between man and nature in an ever-industrializing world, and the significance of culture within it. One of the best books I own! As a cultural anthropologist and a lover of stories, I heartily recommend this book!!"
1,Never buy from this company!,"The size that they give is misleading! On the package that I recieved, the costume said that it is a size 12-14. Now I know that America is becoming more obese, but when did the standard size become 12-14?! When I tried to return it, the company never answered their phone and never returned my emails! Don't every buy anything from them!"
5,Sojourner by Jason Molina,This quite possibly could be the finest collection of music ever assembled. I strongly recommend you buy it if you are at all into Jason Molina
2,Too much of a not-so-great thing,"Given the size of this collection and the ""critic's darling"" hype sourrounding it, I had hoped for something with the same breadth and ambition as, say, the Magnetic Fields' ""69 Love Songs,"" but it just seems to be a whole lot of the same thing.So if you like vaguely indie-country songs that are all the same mid-slow tempo, sung in what I have to assume is a deliberately off-key voice, then you will get a lifetime supply if you buy this. On the positive side, the singer is very earnest and there are some pretty good lyrics. Really, any ONE or TWO of these songs are fine.But If you want a little variety in your ""alt-country,"" I suggest you try ""Cassedega"" by Bright Eyes for starters."
1,Seriously flawed,"When it is focused directly on the Buddha's message, this book can be marvelous. Unfortunately, the author's own ideas slip in several places, especially towards the end of the book, sometimes in disturbing ways. I say ""disturbing"" because this text is offered as an introduction to Buddhism. A reader who is unfamiliar with Buddhism may blindly accept several profoundly unenlightened ideas thinking they are Buddha's own, when they actually express the author's confusion.I would have given the book three or four stars had it been titled, ""Buddha, His Life and Teachings, Plus Some of Osho's Radical Insights."" Even though I don't believe Osho's radical ideas are truly ""insights,"" at least that way an inexperienced reader would be prompted to separate words that reflect Buddha from words that reflect Osho."
5,Very Scary Read,"The title does not do justice to this book. It is one of the scarier horror novels I have read. Unfortunately, it is out of print now. One to look for on the used book store shelves."
5,A must have for Italian music lovers!,"This is a great cd! 883's lyric's are very upbeat and fun. It's the perfect cd for someone in a bad mood, guarenteed to cheer you up."
4,Great product,"This product was everything I expected - for me, these eye pillows are very useful in getting to sleep quickly. The product arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition."
2,Small Eye Pillow,I brought this silk eye pillow to replace a silk eye pillow I brought many years ago.This one is small compared to the item I was trying to replace. Not what I was expecting.
5,Great CD,I wasnt a Sarah McLachlan fan but I am now. I actually first bought MirrorBall but didnt like it because It was a live cd where you here people or fans in the background but this one I like because its just her I enjoyed it. My favorite song is I will Remember you and its perfect
1,beware of the return policy,"I made a mistake and ordered the wrong Chloe scent as a Christmas present for my daughter--I guess she wanted the latest Chloe perfume and I neglected to clarify. Anyway...Amazon is generally great about accepting returns, but when I tried to return this item I learned it was classified as a ""hazardous material"" and because of that it was not returnable. I ordered a whole bunch of stuff at the same time that I ordered the perfume, but I honestly don't remember any kind of a warning or notice alerting me that this item couldn't be returned. If there was one, then I missed it and I am certainly at fault.My experience with Amazon in the past has been great, but this left a bit of a bad taste."
2,Same as Madacy.....,"As With Madacy's release of THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES, these two Brentwood DVDs feature re-edited opening and closing credits without the original theme songs. The prints used are watchable, but unremarkable with plenty of dropouts and splices/scratches. For the price, though I give 2 stars for the amount of episodes featured - all early b/w episodes from 1962-1963."
5,Correction,"""This is supposed to be one of the Summer Movies on Nick. It stars Timmy, Cosmo, Wanda, T's Mom, T's Dad, Vicky, Chip Skylark, Deep Toot {Tootie}, Doug Dimmadome, Chester, and A.J. This movie should be releasing some time in May or June.""Whoever wrote that is *probably* thinking of Channel Chasers. (Chip Skylark?) I just wanted to inform everyone ***THAT THIS MOVIE IS NOT WHAT THE GUY WHO WROTE THAT REVIEW IS TALKING ABOUT!***"
5,THE BEST FAIRLY ODD PARENTS MOVIE YET!,"this is the greatest fairly odd parents movie yet and it has songs so it dosn't get boring this is the funniest with political jokes and songs ""kids just being kids"" ""Flappy's song"" ""adults ruin everything""(one of my favorites which kids will love)""Timmy's song""(one of my favorites)""Where is the fun""(my ultimate favorite)""Cosmo and Wanda's song"" witch shows how Cosmo and Wanda met.The second half of ""where is the fun"" and ending with ""kids just being kids"" I hope this review helped this is a great movie fairly odd parents fans kids and adults will love!"
5,"""School's out: The musical, Act I & Act II"" - a FOP special","Yay! I'm so excited for this DVD to come out! As a true fan of FOP (""Fairly Odd Parents""), I am especially interested in this upcoming, hour-long special. It is supposidly like a longer episode of the show, only most of it is in song! I know of about 5 or 6 songs that are sung in this special, but I've only heard a rough clip of one over the internet. Apparently, Timmy gets sick of adults always ordering him around, so he wishes that kids could rule the world! His fairies have to grant his wishes, of course, so they do, and it's a perfect world... @ least, for a while. Then somehow the pixies try to take over Fairy World, I forget how. Anyway, I have only heard these things, since this episode will air in the U. S. A. a few days before this DVD comes out. But I can't wait! I think it may very well be one of the absolute best FOPs ever!!! :)"
1,scene out of order,"In this version one of the first scenes in the movie is out of order. the party scene should come after the scene of the father leaving his factory. the BFI - British Film Institute - version of this film is accurate, the color is much better, and it includes a very good commentary track for anyone interested.Furthermore this Koch-Lorber version contains a lot of advertising at the beginning that the viewer is compelled to watch."
3,simplistic view of life as sexual-snooker,"This is a simplistic view where Marxism graduates to Freud in trying to explain life. Class somehow becomes sex as the key to everything. Pretense for intellectualism without much general honesty either.As for the commentaries, what can I say? In this movie, the rest of society undertakes as much pain as the bourgeoisie--however different it may be."
4,A worthwhile textbook,"I found teaching from this a good corrective to bland and irrelevant fyc textbooks. It's built around a series of snowballing exercises that guide students from thinking about an issue that individually concerns them to becoming knowledgeable on that issue. In the process they pick up the basics of research, writing, and revision. It's progressive a la Dewey and Freire, with a heavy dose of logical reasoning, critical readings of sources, and media critique thrown in.One caveat: its layout could use some work. It's hard on the eyes at times. But if you're a progressive fyc instructor, you'll like this. If you're looking for a more standard textbook, it might be too provocative and/or political."
2,College Level,Nothing I read leading to my purchase gave me any indication that this cd was a college level performance. The level of proficiency here is that of a good marching band. The musicality is less than stellar and the record label appears to be little more than a vanity label. Something that will allow the Director to say he was Published.
4,This book profoundly influenced me..,"I read it while in college, probably about ~1979. I gave it to my boyfriend's mother, who I pictured as Mira. ;-) and who was a very typical 50's stay-at-home wife. I don't think she ever gave me her impressions of the book... but this book remains with me even today, as sort of a 'think out of the box' bell-ringing epiphany. My mother was much the same way, you grew up, you got married, and your life was taken care of. Divorce hit her like a nuclear bomb, it was definitely NOT a part of the plan. I can still remember the line from the book ""it never even occurred to her she had a choice"". Great feminist novel. A must read for anyone wanting to understand women's position in the middle of this century."
2,Standing the test of time,"I read ""The Women's Room"" shortly after its publication in 1977. I reread it last month for my bookclub. I recall that my first reading was at least satisfactory. Rereading the book has not been as satisfying an experience. French wrote a polemic that would have best been written as an essay, or, if she insisted on a novel, have been better edited from the almost 700 pages to 300. It is interesting to read as an historic artifact, but great literature it is not."
3,A Feminist Classic,"I approached this book with a little trepidation. I would not consider myself to be a radical feminist, although I think all women should be feminists. The main character, Mira, sort of reminded me of myself.This is a very long book, maybe a little too long. Here and there French goes off an a diatribe that may be a little over the top for me. This book is set in the late 60's suburbia/early 70's Harvard; there's lots of anti war protesting. A variety of characters, housewives and later students at Harvard are here, with all there experiences and points of view. Some characters, like Val and Mira, are more explored and expanded upon than others, but French ambitiously tries to give view points of many different female experiences.Overall, I'm glad I read this, I don't even want to try and summarize this novel. Though long, all women should probably read it, and whether you agree with all of the sentiments presented, much of the book is timely and current to 2009."
4,"Love and Sorrow, Hope and Reconciliation","This book is a must read for anyone who is even remotely interested in how far we, as a society, have come in the struggle for equality. And how far we still have to go. From anger to joy to sadness to laughter and back again, this book dredges up all of these emotions.The characters are pleasant, and there are so many that it's hard not to identify with at least one of them. Unfortunately, it's also hard to mix them up, which makes the reading experience less pleasant. I could hardly keep track of all the bland characters of the 50's. But not to worry, it gets much easier once we arrive in the 70's, where the characters are much more colorful, and easier to follow.Which, in itself, shows us the large differences between these times.Love and sorrow, hope and reconciliation. This book has it. Read it, it just might change a tiny bit of your life. It can, and probably will, open the way for a deeper exploration in the past of feminism and gender-equality."
5,"Feminist treatise, powerful novel, and great read","I'm not sure I could (or would want to) put aside the feminist message of this book. Even though I'm in my 20s and come from a different generation, I was able to empathize Mira's struggles of trying to be a good wife in the 50s and 60s, and then rebelling in the 70s to reclaim her identity and role. At the time this was published, these ideas were probably more revolutionary than they are today, but I still think they are just as important. There were many moments in this book that were happy, many more that were sad, and it was always touching. I recommend this book to many of my women friends of all ages, and always consider it to be one of the best books to read if you're frustrated with your life and need to think about going in a new direction."
4,A Thought Provoking Read,"When my (female) friend sent this to me I was initially highly skeptical, and in fact the first time I picked it up I had to put it down after about ten pages because I couldn't get into it. However, I found that once I got into the story a little bit more I was sucked in and I just read and read. This was definately one of the most thought proviking novels I have ever read, and while it is very dense and thus not for the light reader, if you can make it forty pages in you'll be hooked. I can't promise it will change your life, but it may change your perspective on your mother, her mother, and the entire feminist revolution."
2,not-so-biting social commentary,"I had to read ""The Women's Room"" for class, and never before have I ever been so embarrassed to read a novel in public before. French's so-called feminist work is full of obsolete cliches and awful, trite statements. The book's characters are so pretentiously psuedo-cerebral, it made my entire body hurt to read of their attempts at revolution. The book is in need of some serious editing; an abridged version would have been more tolerable. Lastly, French's decision to include herself (?) as a character and inconsistently breaking out of the third-person voice and into the first thoroughly confused me. I can see why this book would have been a hit in the seventies, but why does it prevail still? It is dated and sadly so."
2,Sadly dated,"I recall this being a big deal when it first came out, but the world has (fortunately) gone marching on and it isn't relevant anymore. Even when it was fresh and new, I do recall hearing women who had gone on to college after having raised families saying things like, ""That never happened to me!"" or ""I never had those feelings!"" or ""I was never that neurotic about my so-called role in life!"" Reading it now, there is a distinctly whiney tone to it and I believe that it exagerrates women's problems (even for the time it encapsulates).Plus -- Something that has always driven me crazy -- The character Val believed Myra was shallow, but revised her opinion when she found out Myra had tried to commit suicide. Gee, is that what it takes to get Val's approval? It bothered me because Val was the archetype of the Warrior Woman that the book was promoting and, apparently, attempting to take your own life was, to her, a sign that you've got something going on intellectually."
1,big mistake,"This book was not at all what I thought it was going to be from the reviews that I read. Most of my bookclub members didn't even finish it, well neither did I. It might have been a classic in its day, but not for me."
2,Not into feminist pieces that are fiction...,"It's books like this that lead so many of us to think we could ""have it all"" without our children suffering."
1,"Insulting, disapointing, borring book!",This book was insulting to me because it was trying to tell me that all relationships between men and women are simply so that a woman can get what she wants or the worst most painful experience of her life. Reading only the first 8 chapters of this book was one of the hardest most maddening reading experience I have ever had.
1,Prepare to be BORED!,"If you like reading a book with no direction, then you're going to love this one. I felt like I was lost the whole time! I'm not kidding! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME, please."
1,The Worst Book Ever Written,The most insulting and boring book ever written. It is a biting social commentary on men-women relations that is so one-sided and vulgar that most readers do not take seriously. Don't ask me how it ended because I couldn't stand the torture of the book
4,King Of The Half Hour,"The book was excellent,well written though I wish there were some pictures in it of Nat Hiken and his co-workers other than the ones on the cover. And I am not sure one of the ""boxers"" on the cover was Sheldon Leonard""."
3,Correction to Below,"While I can sympathize with not buying a book if you believe it is sloppily written, jacket copy isn't written by the author but by some copy writer at the publishing company. It shouldn't have gone out like that (why didn't spellcheck catch it? probably it was written in the layout program and not the word processing one), but neither the author nor the editor are on the hook for this one."
2,NOT a DR SEUSS BOOK,"This is an appropriate book for kids less than 2 years old. It is a vocabulary book that simply lists a bunch of pictures and the words that goes with the pictures. It lists many of the common every day items that you would find in a house. It is not clever and I dare say, it's not _really_ a Dr. Seuss book The Illustration quality is WAY BELOW AVERAGE compared to ANY picture book for young children.Like many books, if its the first one your parents give to you, you will probably love the book. I believe that this is why some other reviewers have raved about this book."
5,Exciting Book,This book was first bought at a thrift store for my husbands first daughter. They literally read the cover off this book. I later replaced it with a new one and now both my husband and I can recite the whole book without looking at the pages. The book has rhythm and rhyme. It is wonderful.
5,In a People House,The book was in GREAT condition! It arrived quickly and I was very happy with my order. I will definitely order again.
4,this was a good book,"i like it because it hads a lot of color in its pictures, good for the little ones, personally i thought it was a fun book."
5,Algorithmic diagnosis are useful,"While the algorhythms may not precisely match your patient, they can provide a different perspective valuable to consider. Fairly small, paperback book is a great addition to your medical library to reference when working on case studies."
4,Great reference,"This book, along with Algorithmic Approach to Treatment, are great reference books for the medical student. It is definitely going to be on my office shelf."
4,Normally I am not a fan of Dunwich's BUT....,"BUT this book is one exception (the other being 'the Wicca Garden' - her spellbooks and others are marginal at best) The potions, oils and other recipes, and there are a lot of them, are great as are the Tarot meditation teas. I have used quite a few of the recipes with good success and highly recommend this book."
5,Essential; for beginners or advanced!,"Magick Potions by Gerina Dunwich is by far one of the most potent witches herbal guides to be published! True to the lore of herbs and plants used in witchcraft, it brilliantly describes the applications of the rare practice of potion-craft. I am a hereditary practitioner and most of my knowledge comes from past generations on general practices; yet I can't describe how this book has supplemented my limited knowledge of herbalism in the craft! I would recommend this book to most students of the craft and (happily) any masters of the craft! A wealth of information from poultices to ritual teas and fluid condensers, I guarantee you will find yourself turning to this book time and again!"
4,Necklace,"I bought 2 necklaces for each daughter for Christmas. The girls wear them all the time, they are very pretty and love opening up the lockets to look at the pictures we put them."
3,jewelry,"Small nick on the front of locket. I placed the order so close to x-mas, that I didn't have time to return it for another."
5,No issues.,"Product arrived quickly, with no issues. TNT is/was a great band, one of my favorites... And this CD has some pretty strong songs on it."
3,Not the real TNT,"Intuition and Tell No Tales are flagship albums for most TNT fans. My Religion gave to the fans what they wanted. In contrast, All the Way to the Sun is a lot more diverse, so there are SOME trademark TNT sounds in there, but most songs feel too different to be as satisfying to listen to. The album doesn't flow as nicely either, because of too much diversity. I really hope they keep recording, but if they want to keep thier fan base they need to stick to thier sound. Some people would say thats boring and selling out, but not me - I will never get bored of thier classic albums."
3,"Good and complete, but very dry and too big","I'd say it's a book I'll keep and likely use as a reference but I doubt I'll ever read the whole thing. It goes into WAY too much detail about too many sub-points and comes out being very very dry reading.It's half dictionary, 80% iterative tangents made linear and 100% too much material. The style is also a little odd, being textbookish while also seeming very peer-reviewed journal. Not quite what I was expecting."
5,Great look,One of the best watches I have ever owned. Nice to look at. It's not too large and overpowering. The white face is very easy to read. The night viewing is also excellent. Can be read easily with no light at all. Can't go wrong with this watch. I have owned it for almost a year and a half and have not had any problems at all.
4,A great guide to texas fossils,"This book is easy to use, informative and quite helpful to the texas fossil hunter. The pictures cover a very broad range of texas fossils, and though not always in color, are very helpful in identification."
5,A Field Guide to Fossils of Texas,Excellent pictures which are needed when you read the descriptions of each specific fossil.Very well written and detailed book of fossils within Texas.
4,"This is an excellent EP, well worth the 15 bucks","This has some great stuff on it, the trickster and lewis (mistreated) are great songs, fast catchy tunes, and i really like permanent daylight, one of my favorite radiohead songs. the vocals on the acoustic creep are wonderful"
5,Sheer Brilliance,"Such a work of art, Radiohead can't be stopped. They just keep coming out with better and better music."
2,4 mp3 tracks?,"Much to my dismay, only 4 tracks were available from amazon MP3. The 4 tracks are nice, but you cant call an album with half the tracks by the same name."
5,Great Radiohead EP,This EP contains songs that are just as good as those found on The Bends. The album brings back memories of when the guitar was a more prominent instrument in Radiohead's songs. This is an album that belongs on the shelf of any Radiohead fan.
4,Really Quite Good,"This is worth picking up for die-hard Radiohead fans; casuals need not bother. Of the eight songs, six are unreleased elsewhere, one is the ""My Iron Lung"" from The Bends (possibly that album's best song), and the remaining one is Thom Yorke's solo acoustic ""Creep."" All the songs are good, and ""The Trickster,"" ""Lewis (Mistreated),"" and the nice instrumental ""Perfect Daylight"" are of special note. Many have complained about the version of ""Creep,"" but I like it a lot; Yorke's emotion and honesty really come across here. This is recommended for fans."
4,buy this now!,"this is an excellent cd that all fans should have in their collection.From The Trickster an excellent,riff-led rock song to quite simply the most beautiful radiohead song, ""you never wash up.."",this is simply- Radiohead. Other stand out tracks are creep (of course!)and permanent daylight."
4,A radiohead fan,"I like to get high on a variety of drugs and listen to Radiohead. Weed is of course a good way to go, but shrooms and ecstacy also make music sound incredible. This EP is as good as any to listen to when you're on drugs and you're in the mood for good music."
3,Orthotic Shoes,"These shoes serve their purpose ... to use with orthotics. They have velcro fasteners which make them nice. However, they are bulky shoes and look like they are for orthotics."
3,Not a true counted cross stitch,"I purchased this cross stitch thinking that it was counted only, but the fabric has printed symbols on it with the design stitched on top. Had I known this, I wouldn't have purchased it. The pattern symbols are also very small."
2,Wordy Sanford Bennett,"I was disappointed with this book. The fuzzy pictures of the exercises are separate from the how to description which is always buried between and around Bennet's opinions of medicine, women's beauty treatments and religion. Very difficult to follow."
4,Got protection?,"This cover is fantastic! The soft but durable rubber makes the ease of use out standing. The functions are useable on the Express with the cover on, fits purfect. Easly pull the end of cover down for USB access. The neet clip lets you hook it on your belt loop or what ever. Really protects the Express from damage, I would give it 5 stars if not for the price ,seems a little high, but it dose the job well. Should last a long time."
5,Great folk album,"I've been buying Michael's CDs little by little and just gave a listen to Homestead. I think this is his best album, although the Evening Song album comes very close. Both works have a poetic theme, I guess this one about home is certainly more universal. I lost my husband a couple of years ago and have never felt more moved or musically comforted by anything as much as these songs. I agree with everything Mr. Ross wrote about Micheal as an artist, as a person and as a musician. So incredibly moving and thoughtful, from the first song to the last. Ellen"
3,Helping Mother in Nursing Home,This is a good game to play with an elder. It's easy and not too much to think about. Keep the mind thinking.
4,Simply Fun!,"I like simple games that are easy to set up and play. It doesn't get much simpler than this. The cards are layed out and you start rolling the dice to win ""prizes."" Even though you win one, it can be won from you by another player if they roll what is needed. The winner is the one with three prizes at the BEGINNING of their turn. This makes for a lot of passing and rooting for someone else. I like that.The only real draw-back to the game is that so many prizes are almost impossible to get and usually the same ones get tried for over and over again. This can make for a longer game than necessary. And, if you're playing with people who are not risk takers, the game gets a little slow and predictable.The low educational rating is due to the fact that the game doesn't require that player to do anything but count and remember.Overall, this is a great little game to buy for the whole family. This is not a good game for teens or a primarily adult crowd."
4,Dolphin Shade,"If you like dolphins like I do, you will love this shade. The could be a little taller, but then I am a big windshield. Chevy Impala 2002"
2,Dissappointed,I purchased the sun shades for my side windows which they don't work. I don't think the description was detailed enough. So I decided to use them for my front windows. Only one shade has the 'strap' to hook to the rear view mirror. There much bigger than expected.
1,overpriced for value,"This item is simply one with the same quality, size and density of one found in a claw machine in an arcade. Disappointed to have spent so much on the item itself as well as shipping."
4,NOT BAD AT ALL !!!,"If you skip over ""Set You Free"", all of the other tracks are decent to very good techno-rave style tracks. The highlights are the intro, ""Feel the Music"", ""Track Me Down"", ""Believe in Yo Self"", ""Cosmic Orgazim"" and the remaining tracks on the disc. Worth having in your music collection."
3,REALLY GOOD MUSIC FOR THE CAR OR TO SHAKE YOUR BOOTY,"I HAVE LISTENED TO THEIR MUSIC FOR AWHILE, AND THEY PUT OUT GOOD DANCE TRACKS. IN FACT THE REASON I AM HERE ON THE INTERNET NOW IS TO GET THIS ALBUM. (ONE OF THE FEW GOOD MEN US. MARINE)"
1,One of the worst songs I have ever heard,"Set U Free, come into my planet soul, whatever the hell the name of that exceedingly irritating song is, I absolutely HATE IT!!!!!!! It's just mindless brain clogging junk food for the mind. I'd use the Cd for a coaster."
4,Long live the King!,"After a couple of tributes to Mercyful Fate, his legendary band from the early 80's, this homage to the King was long overdue. Novice artists at their best. Particularly enjoyable is the Welcome Home version by Prototype. Church Of The Devil is a must for any real metal fan."
1,Don't buy,"This product is misleading, the sizes are waaaaay off. I have a wonderful brand new pair of shorts that are going to goodwill I guess."
5,the nevadan,another excellent randolp scott movie the color is good picture is sharp and clear it should be on blueray that would great.
2,Hard to find something good to say,"Katz and Rubin's collection of exercises is an assortment of hackneyed ideas such as the communal chessgame in the office combined with many that are silly if not dangerous such as wearing workgloves while driving. This book may provide some new ideas for those who lives are unrelentingly monotonous but its exercises can largely be summarised as ""do something different today"". So do something different and don't bother with the book!"
4,Keep Your Brain Alive,"This is a really quick read...Full of practical information. If you want actual exercises to do to increase your memory, this is it.You can read it today and start working on your brain capacity tonight!"
4,A nice book to put things in perspective,I like this book and it does add to my collection of memory books that helps me on every day and during those routines that can cause anxiety.
4,Fun Book--Outdated,"One can benefit from this book, yet it's a wee bit outdated. Nevertheless, some of the exercises are still quite useful especially for those of us who have gone over the magic 50."
2,Interesting concepts not sure about research,Book was a short read and.not too expensive. Research is still out on effectiveness of these concepts. I do some because I'm sure they do no harm. Not as sure that they produce the stated results.
5,"Read the whole book, don't skip around. Great Book!","This is a great book. One thing I must say is that you must read the whole thing. The first time I read it I skipped to the exercises and missed the whole point of the book. One day I picked up the book and read it from the beginning. It was like reading a completely different book then when I started in the middle. The reviewer that said it didn't cover different types of thought probably skipped the beginning since he thought it was just a collection of exercises. This book helps you to develop different parts of your brain by challenging your brain. When you do routine tasks your brian is barely working, your cerebral cortex isn't even ""plugged in"". This books helps to strengthen your brain. I just bought 5 copies as gifts. I only wish I had read this book at 30 (I've only just turned 40). If I had been using this for ten years I couldn't even imagine (even with my new brain) where I might be now."
3,"Adequate, but be careful","This book contains some exercises which might be good for one's brain. However, I did not notice any improvement. Furthermore, some of the exercises he suggests are not helpful, and I found them in fact to hinder my own brain's functioning. I refer to the suggestion that using one's non-dominant hand could be beneficial to one's brain. This may be true in some cases, but I strongly suggest not to use one's non-dominant hand to write, because this can result in the development of a stutter. It is well known that when children are forced to change their writing hand it can have negative effects. I don't think the author specifically suggested experimenting with changing one's writing hand however, he did not recommend against this course, which is why I am writing this now. A much better book for improving one's brain is ""The Einstein Factor"" by Win Wenger."
5,Fun way to keep brain from decay!,"The mind and memory tend to break down as we age. But they do not have to. This little book of exercises first briefly describes the mental processes and how they can break down and why. Then it offers many simple daily exercises we can utilize to prevent that from happening. The brain exercises are fun and easy. As a student of psychology with an interest in cognitive psychology, I am certain the methods are in line with the current research on effective methods to improve and maintain brain function. Everyone should use it."
1,Neurobiologists know: this is pure fiction,"Yes, this book does offer a ""very interesting explanation of how the brain processes information."" Unfortunately, that explanation is not supported by experimental evidence. There really is no data to suggest that poking at produce or walking around a room with your eyes shut is going to induce the production of neurotrophins. Nor that such production of neurotrophins would result in new synapse formation. Nor that those synapses would result in a healthier brain. The arguments presented in this book form a house of cards that rely on premises that have no foundation in scientific fact. Dr. Katz must be calculating that his standing as a respected neurobiologist will be sufficient proof of his unsupported theories. It's unfortunate that he didn't use his intelligence and erudition to bring some real neurobiology to the lay public."
4,The book is excellent and based on solid scientific research,"Having read the book and a great many articles on the brain, I am confident that it is helpful and meaningful. I find the sudden spate of bad reviews from Indiana (..unsigned) , to be overtly suspicious. Perhaps professional jealousy? This neurobic system supports all the findings of the MacArthur studies."
5,Just trying to keep my brain alive.,I was looking for a book to challenge my brain and keep it alive. I found it.
3,Interesting Exercises,"I ordered this book ""used"" and it came in perfect shape. Looked brand new. Arrived quickly as well. It is full of exercises to do to retrain and improve brain power and they are not your typical exercises so they are fun. Do they work? We'll see I guess."
4,GOOD BOOK,"This item was in good condition, and some markings but overall good selection, but due season mailings with some delay."
5,As time goes on ...,"The authors did their apprenticeship with an addition to the Overlord hagiography, and have now worked up to the Vietnam era. In due time, we may expect a re-write of Fallujah and Abu Ghraib. Well, as boys say when they play Army: we killed more of them than they did of us."
5,I really missed out,"I'm your typical extremely attractive man with above average intelligent and exceptional slow pitch softball ability but boy did I miss out on the sixties. I picked up this CD while riding a carousel and this thing is totally cool. I heard it and said, Is that freedom rock? Well, turn it up man! I don't know what half these songs are about because I'm not whacked out of my mind but they sure are cool What the heck is a Hurdy Gurdy Man? I don't know, but it's got the flow of the DOC. I'm kind of a hippie because I drive a renault alliance so this music is something I'm completely down with. It's not Hasselhoff, but at this point of time, the world wasn't ready for Hasselhoff. It was ready for White Rabbits, incense and peppermints and Hurdy Gurdy Men. It was a cool time that I missed out on."
2,the sound is horrible,I was considering buying this until I heard some of the previews...I've heard better amateur recordings. I guess stick to the studio stuff if you want to support the band.
3,"Excellent at nothing (ok, I guess the cover is nice)","From reading this text, it is unclear whether it set out to be a review of or an introduction to behavior based robotics. Although it discusses some the most important and popular work in behavior based AI from the past 20 years, the coverage of these subjects is quite weak. Many pages are devoted to explaining the obvious or irrelevant in excruciating detail. This text is lacking in substance and is definitely not worth its...price tag."
3,CLUMSY BUT WORKS!,"THESE WORK, BUT ARE CLUMSY, DIFFUCULT TO WORK WITH & ACTUALLY TO LONG FOR MY CHEVY IMPALA, BUT THEY WORK!"
1,Poor,"This is tiny. Complete wrong size, does not fit car at all. Does not work at all. Complete waste of money."
5,Perfume,I love this perfume and it's half of the price as my local department store. Well worth it. I would recommend this perfume to anyone who likes perfume that is not too over powering.
3,Too many fragrances that are too similar,"VI is more floral than fruity to me. It's young, flirty, fresh, bright, clean and clear. VI is another fragrance that offers a take on a modern rose without being all about roses, if that makes any sense.There's much to like about this fragrance but not much to love imo. There is so many similar fragrances, yet one could do a lot worse that VI. However at this price, I'd go for something else!Sample-worthy, not bottle-worthy."
4,Not Boxed,"I was very disappointed the way I received this item. My long time friend who is a senior, talked about this item any time we talked. So for her 71st birthday, I wanted to surprise her and buy it for her. I was Very Disappointed when I received it and wanted to send it back and purchase something else. I did not receive it as pictured, next to a box. Instead, it came in a velvet like pouch which was NOT PRESENTABLE. I wanted to receive it as pictured, indicating that it came in a box. Or it should have stated that it would NOT BE BOXED as some items did state. I gave it to my friend anyway, but I felt bad because the presentation was very Tacky. As I stated at the beginning of this review, I Was Very Disappointed!"
2,If you want an honest opinion,"Well, I bought this perfume based on the recommendation of the salesperson at Macy's. She said it was the #1 seller in the store for a year. So, even though I wasn't crazy about it in the store, I figured I wanted to be ""with it"", and I bought it. Well, at home, I sprayed it on, and my 5-year-old son says ""Mom! You smell like camping! Like that stuff we spray on for bugs!"" Needless to say, I haven't worn it since. Maybe it's just my body chemistry with it. You should definitely try this on before you buy it (and maybe ask a kid for an opinion!).I gave two stars because the bottle is unique."
1,Spilled perfume effect,"Just got this as a gift from someone who loves it. It is so strong, perfumy, like you are drenched in fragrance. I'm not surprised people get complimented because there is no question you are wearing perfume!"
3,New does not mean used,"Have worn this fragrance for years and adore it. Having bought perfume from amazon before, I trusted this would be what it was advertised. Instead of a new bottle, I got a package that had been opened and used. Bottle showed missing product and cap showed use. Disappointed in amazon for selling me used and new. 5 stars for fragrance, 1 for service."
3,"Pretty smell, poor staying power","Great fragrance with notes of peony and musk. Unfortunately, though, the staying power is pretty bad. For that reason I don't recommend purchasing this."
1,Very irreisitible by Givenchy,"I purchased this product as my own supply was getting low...upon receipt...it didn't appear to be the same thing...the bottle was a slightly different design and color..and the perfume did not smell the same...I tested it on my skin...on paper and on cloth...it definately was not the same product...it was either old, or a ""knock-off""...and it smells so bad...it is not usable..."
3,"not bad, but I did tire quickly of it","This is a rather non-descript but pleasant floral/spice type perfume, not bad, and here I see it at a significant discount which seems right. Some will like it, a few will hate it, but it won't rock anyone's world-pardon the expression-if that's what you're looking for."
3,Bumpin,"If you're in to Memphis, TN bump...this cd is for you. Check out track #12 ""Ballin all day"". Also track #18."
2,Really disappointed,"As a life coach I have read hundreds of self-development books, but never got round to read any Martha Beck. I was really excited to finally get to listen to 'Follow Your North Star' on audio book, but that excitement lasted about 90 minutes.I can see for total newbies to self-development it could be useful, but she lost me when she talked about meditation like people did in the 1920's, as though it were some big secret that she was revealing to the western world.I may be being overly critical because I have had clients that raved over this book and it's usefulness is down to the reader, but it was one big yawn to me and I didn't feel I got anything out of it."
2,Not what I exspected,Simple ...not what I exspected too many stories out to left field for me anyway
4,small bright headlight,"The Gerber Triode is an ultralight headlight, requiring only a headstrap, not an over-the-head band. It uses a single common AAA cell within the lampholder. No water got in when I tested it. It is far brighter and lasts much longer than the Black Diamond Ion (an even smaller headlight). The beam is broad, and provides plenty of illumination for hiking or work in dark places. The low beam is useful for reading. Unfortunately Gerber does not appear to have tried to make it as compact as possible; it is about the same size as headlights that use multiple AAA cells. It is much more bulky than the Black Diamond Ion (which uses a single nearly unobtainable short-lived L28 cell)."
2,Funny but not hilarious,"I enjoyed these seasons, but I didn't think either was as funny as the first season. Others will disagree, so maybe it's just not my thing. My advice is to enjoy the first season and stop there."
2,Megan,"I ordered the Newlyweds seasons 2 and 3. I only got 2 disc and there were suppose to be 3. I got all three cases but one was empty, I guess they thought they could rip me off!!! I would never order from this seller again or amazon.com!!!!"
5,Newlyweds-Nick and Jessica-The complete Second and Third Seasons,It was very good. Nick was very romantic surprising her on certain occassions. Very entertaining. I loved it.
5,WORTH YOUR MONEY!!,"Ok, I bought this and I wasint at first sure if this was gun be a worth while buy or not ... but I assure You ITS the BEST, its a very intertaining show!It'll make you laugh and for sure keep your attention! I have watched all episodes over in over in even after seeing each one over ten times each I could watch it all over again and not be bored ! When its all said in done this is def sumthing you want to add to your DVD collection!"
5,Newlyweds season 2 & 3,"I loved watching Nick and Jessica on newlyweds when it was ontv and taped it to have it to watch anytime I wanted.I'm glad it was put out on dvd and I also have the first season.I enjoy the deleted scenes and the bloopers, it is a great show."
3,Best episode missing,"I'm still bugged by the missing final episode of season 2 (or season 3, as they marketed the DVD) with Jessica's birthday party and new PUPPY! They didn't include it in the season 4 DVD either--which I had bought in the hopes that it would be on there. Shame on you, MTV Home Entertainment!Anyway, it's a fantastic reality show--why else would Britney, Carmen, etc. copy it all the way to the bank? Very funny. They should just re-release it to include the missing eps :P"
3,I Love This Show but ...,"Whilst I still laugh out loud each time I watch this (she's dumb but in a cute funny way), I was a bit peeved that they claim it's seasons 2 and 3 yet from the way it's been shown on TV it's really only season 2. Unless they aired both seasons back to back, this is incorect and you're only buying 1 season. However, that being said, you should still get a kick from all the antics and it's always fun and enjoyable to watch Nick whose so cute and obviously a very patient guy."
3,a bit of a let down....,"although i loved this dvd, i have to say i was confused for a long time...... i couldnt work out where season 3 was, having checked the offical mtv website and discovering what was packaged as season 3 is actually season 2 helped clear things up a little, but still meant i didnt get what i was expecting from the dvd. still love newlyweds, but wish i had got what i thought i was paying for."
1,Disappointing..,"I hate how much Jessica have changed. IT took her being stupid to get attention. Thats super sad. This dvd is totally ""staged"" I just lost so much respect.."
5,i still live newlyweds anyway...,"so it may be missing a couple episodes...its still good. besides, whoever said that its missing the last episode of nick and jess moving...thats not season 3, its season 4!!!! DUH!!!! get ur facts straight and then get on here to say stuff about it once you know!. jeepers"
2,Nick and Jessica DVD,The third DVD in the box was defected but I didn't notice until I had had it a few days and decided to finally look at it. I tried it in two different DVD players so I know it is the disc. Very disappointed with that.
1,Boring.,"I find this show very boring. Like another reviewer said, all they do is travel to the recording studio, watch T.V., do laundry and fight over food. You might as well just watch your parents fight, kids. I mean, at the end of the day, they fight over food and who's grabbing the remote, don't they? They fight over who should do the laundry, right? All that's left is the recording studio part, but that's not very entertaining to watch for us..."
1,I'M SO,"Oh my gaw! That other reviewer is right - I am just so, so jellllllus of Jessica and her marriage to Nick that watching these DVDs makes me want to tear my hair out and smother my husband of six years. I yearn for the life Jessie has of being: bleach-blonde, fake-tanned, married to someone whose eyes have surprisingly not fallen out of his sockets given the amount of times he rolls them at her, and whose creepy father constantly hovers around, making comments about her sex life and (...). Oh yes, jealous I am. I am soooooooo envious!I think what I really wish I had is Jessie's intellect, ya know, that of a flea, because being stooooopid is hot, y'all. Being dumb and man-faced with (...)Oh and getting divorced after putting your marriage on the air for three years is just THE ULTIMATE cool. It's kind of like throwing out last year's fashions, you know. So if you're dying to live Jessie's life vicariously, this is the DVD for you. ENJOY!"
3,SHARRISSA AND YOLANDA WHAT IS WRONG WIT U 2,"This whole thing is kinda funny, i mean how many normal people fight about the newlyweds, this conversation has as much depth as teen people magazine.and as 4 that whole thing about being gay what is wrong with that, do i sense some homophobia here.As 4 piper and yolanda giving sharissa a beat down, i'm all 4 dat i here she lives in miami but remember this wise saying when doing so, beating is fun so beat her down until she's as good as done. Hey, well at least u'lle be famous at the post office and maybe the smartest people on the earth (jessica simpson and nick lachey)can help u get relesed from the slammer, i hear that jessica simpson is a really good laywer.Sharissa u better get a tetanus shot 4 when piper and Yolanda bit u up lets just hope Sharissa isn't a 42 year old dude cause dats nasty."
3,how do you know,the movie just came out today how could you know all that stuff unless you had a pre order but im too a advide watcher so im going get it for $$ money
1,No quality,"The picture quality is just bad. Trailer is almost OK, which gives a chance to compare and evaluate. I did not want to watch more than 10 first minutes. Sound is non-existent too.It is too disturbing, even, if you are a fan of martial arts movies. Too cheap."
1,Crap vs. Crap,"Another horrifically made kung-fu film; the fighting was stupid and sloppy, the plot was pure awful. Do not buy this, you will regret it!"
1,colddogs reveiw,this book is extremly bad and I dont like it but I dont no you may like it your selfcolddog
2,Too ... for the Content Given,"The information is basic and development of the design equations is not very detailed. For...I would have expected a hardbound text written at the college level. To be fair, it's useful, it's just not worth the money being charged. A more appropriate price would be....Almost 100 of the 238 pages are devoted to computer program listings.This is a great ""how to"" book if you want information to do the preliminary design of a composite homebuilt. Not much information is included about other construction methods...."
1,HUH???,I thought that in Melanie's Last Ride they said she was going to stay at Whitebrook for good. What is she going to do now? Go back to New York and leave Trib and Pirate? Don't think so. Because then she wouldn't be able to be in #32 when she becomes a horse racing fanatic. Can someone tell me what is going on here?
4,Really Good!,"I really liked this one, I feel hat Mel is a realistic person. But the fact that the new writer just dropped the previous stars (ie:Cindy, Samantha etc...) just totally sucks! It's like they live in a different dimension. Anyway, I like both ways they are written, although I prefer Joanna. PLEASE NO MORE SUPER HORSES FROM HEAVEN! They make me sick!"
3,Melanie is... interesting,"OKay, well, i love the THoughoughbred series but I have to say that this was not the best one. WHy? Because in the THouroughbred series, the whole point of of the books are racing horses. I can not say that about this one. IT dissapionted me. The reason that i read this series is that I love horses and like to read about them. IN this book, a lot of it has to do with MELANIES life and MELANIE moves away from her horses and goes to the city. It also seems like she abuses TRIB when she brings him to NEW YORK. BUt, to people who like this book, I agree with them in the ways that MElanie learns a GREAT lesson and so does her father."
3,This should be re-written,"This story is okay. The thing I do not enjoy this story because the people do not do realistic things. I mean would you bring a horse use to a farm in Kentucky to a stable in the city in New York? Everybody says Christina is a brat, but she is very nice to people, but I have to amit she can be bratty. Also I personally think Ansleyee is far worse on a brat scale."
1,This Book Is Unrelistik,i dont like this book becuz its weird. i mean they dont have horses in the city! what is joanna thinking.
4,"it was good, keep em coming.........","i love these books, i have them all. i have read them over and over, but what i dont get is why one book is about christina, then ashleigh then melanie? stay in one place .... keep the characters together...i mean there could be a x-mas book where everyone comes back, cindy, samantha, tor, mandy, yvonne, all those people. for the most part, i dont care who the characters are as long as there are always more books to read.."
1,ATTENTION TB READERS,"As you know, Joanna Campbell's first Ashleigh book comes out in August or September. The books are about before Ashleigh and her family have to move to Townsend Acres. The first three books are, ""Lightning's Last Hope"", ""A Horse for Christmas"" and ""Waiting for Stardust."" After writing these three books she says that she would like to write a couple of Supers to explain the gap between #23 &#24. She also says that the deadlines are SO tight now (a book a month) that she can't possibly write all the books. Nor does she think that several different writers producing a book a month will enhance the quality of the series. All of that is in the publisher's hands, not hers.If you would like to comment on this review e-mail me."
1,"Some old Animals tracks, mostly not the Animals","The first 13 tracks on this CD are another re-iteration of tracks recorded by Danny McCulloch, the bass player with Eric Burdon and the Animals in the late 1990s. They have been released under several titles over the past decade or so. Beware if you see CDs with songs such as Howlin', Frisco Queen, and Colour of the Sunset.The last 4 tracks are taken from the original Animals' concert on December 31, 1963 at the Club A Go Go in Newcastle where they were also backing Sonny Boy Williamson. These are excellent tracks capturing the group live in their early days. Mojo Magazine has called the original album from this concert one of the top live albums of the early British Invasion. The entire concert, with both the Animals' and Sonny Boy Williamson's sets has just been re-released as ""Taken Alive"". This is a CD that is well worth purchasing."
1,Wish I had read the first Review,"This is the most definite rip-off ever. This recording is NOT by The Animals. It's some second rate garage band with no pride or talent. Do they think people won't recognize that?????? The worst part is I supposedly can't return it, because, its been opened! BUT YOU CAN'T FIND OUT THE RIP-OFFIT IS UNTIL IT'S BEEN OPENED. Quite a conundrum! I'm GONNA RETURN it ANYWAY. Not to mention, it took Amazon.com beyond time to deliver it, and I accepted the extra wait, just because I believed I was going to get the real deal. It came AFTER Christmas. Unfortunately I was too caught up in Christmas shopping to read the review first! This is the first time Amazon.com has dissappointed me. WARNING: LOOK OUT FOR PRODUCTS THAT AREN'T PICTURED."
2,Fake,This copy is not the original. It has fake guitar music. I don't know what they used to make the guitar music. Sounds like an electric piano or something.
1,complete and utter crap,Amazon should remove this listing. All sellers should remove this item from their stock.
1,A Mother F in' Rip Off!!!!!!!!!!,"If you bought this album, you're one of the shmucks, like me, who was the victom of a scam! Yes, this cd and the company who made it, was a scam. If by looking at the label, you thought, hey this looks like the perfect Animals collection; good price, good song material, all true, but, IT's NOT THE ANIMALS!!!!!!!!!!!!It is a bunch of modernized versions of old classics by The Animals. The guy who gave this cd a five star review, must be drunk, or deaf. I was so shocked when I first heard this cd. I kept skipping the tracks one by one, and every single one was modern and electronic-ized. It was like a bad friken dream! If I was old enough to sue, I'd sue this company for, well MISLEADINGNESS!!!!!!!!!!! This is absolutely a crime, and I should report this to ""Seven On Your Side."" I think you'll all agree, this is a big rip off scam!"
1,ARRGGG!,"Dear God burn it, burn it! Holy Hell, i have no idea what these people did to these songs but they sound like crap. This is an aweful cd, it's just a collection of some of The Animals most well known songs, which have somehow been ""digitally remastered"" to grate on your eardrums. It's not even Eric Burdon and The Animals who sing the songs on the cd, it's some moron with a synthesizer. My God they should all be burned and sent back to Hell where they belong."
1,(almost) funny,"I got this as a well meaning gift. On the first track there's some guy who tries his best to sound a little bit like Eric Burdon, but in fact sounds like he has a chest disease. It's all downhill from there. Because I didn't actually pay for this, I'm not too enraged: the intro to ""Don't Let Me Be Mistunderstood"" made me laugh out loud. But not much.Like the others said: don't buy this CD. I wanted to give it no stars but the review form wouldn't let me."
2,Only one episode per disk?,"Why have only 5 episodes on 5 disks?I would have thought at least 2 or even 3 episodes would have been fair value for money.If the TV shoe ""Friends"" can put 8 half hour episodes on a disk,then shows like Bonanza should be able to do better than a pitiful one episode per disk."
3,Valuable Collection BUT......,"I bought the Bonanza 5PAC and I believe it's a decent collection,especially for Bonanza ""die hard fans""..BUT...The sound and picture are not of very good quality..A great dissapointment is the absence of the classical Bonanza soundtrack....They could have put more than just 1 episode per disk..I hope they will do that in future collections....A major disadvantage in my opinion is the absence of subtitles of any language..This is very importand especially for shoppers outside US like me...Finally i think that the packet would be more attractive in a lower price.."
5,Bridge Book,I ordered three 25 Conventions You Should Know which arrived at my home in three days. No shipping and a great Price compared to other sites I checked. I will definitely check prices at Amazon before ordering anything on line again. I am very pleased with Amazon!!!Thank YouDonna
4,Great learning tool,"This book has been invaluable to my husband and me as newer duplicate players. We periodically review each chapter and take the quizzes, to make sure we haven't forgotten anything about that convention. It gives us a platform for partner bidding understanding and growth."
3,Slight but interesting work on U. S. Grant,"An interesting series, although rather slender in substance. The premise? Provide a brief biography and some context. Then, provide quotations from the subject of the work as well as others who knew the protagonist. The focus here? U. S. Grant.One of his quotations speaks to the Mexican War and represents a rather interesting perspective (Page 5): ""I regard the war as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation."" Capturing Grant's aggressive attitude, a statement at Shiloh from him after a pretty dreary first day (Page 17): ""Retreat? No. I propose to attack at daylight and whip them.""Kind of a fun concept to this series. Not substantively great, but enjoyable. . . ."
5,Story teller Alanis morissette,She is just the best on her kind..........I daying for the Unplugged of her too......Tony Estrada Juarez MExico
4,Great DVD by a great artist,Alanis is a fantastic artist and this really captures her powerful emotion. The sound quality is great (the first thing I look for) and you just feel like you are right there.My only wish is that there were more songs on this DVD as it is a bit short.This DVD includes an important feature which some dont. It allows you to skip the talking and just play the music. On your 100th listen you just really dont want to here the whole explanation over again.A solid buy!
2,Alanis is great - the DVD isn't,"The music of course is good and seeing Alanis interpreting her songs is inspiring for all of us that enjoy creativity and spontaneity. But the producer really did not do a good job. Regularly, he'll focus the camera on the audience, closing up on some man or woman, who is singing along as if she had been smoking marijuana (sorry guys). I understand that the camera may not be at all times on a close-up on Alanis, but instead it could be on the other musician's."
4,Cambride Objective KET Review,I have found the Cambridge Objective KET Study book very useful and easy to use in preparation for my ESOL KET Exam Please be aware though that this does not include the CD's required for the listening exercises and these need to be purchased separately.
3,This is in response to Moron Robert J. Usher's idiotic review.,"Hey Robert, you Idiot! Dave did not rip off Louis Prima or the Beach Boys! The songs on this album are ""Covers"" you Moron! A few of the Original Beach Boys even did guest, back-up vocals on the California Girls ""Cover""! If they were cool enough to sing back-up, how can you call it a Rip-Off??? This is a cool, 4 ""Cover""-song EP. Its not Awesome, but it is very decent. Dave's versions of all of these songs, have become fond memories, in their own right. In fact, yes, many people do associate Just a Gigalo/I Ain't Got Nobody with Diamond Dave, far more than they do Louis Prima & Co. cause, guess what? Dave's version flat out blows Louis' away! That, and you just don't hear a whole lot of Louis Prima nowadays. . . I suppose you feel that Hendrix ripped off Dylan with All Along the Watch Tower & the Beatles ripped off Chuck Berry with Roll Over Beethoven. Jeeze, give me a break!"
2,"Get ""The Best"" instead, you'll get 3 of these 4 songs","I have no problem with the material here, especially since it contains two of Dave's biggest solo hits - ""California Girls"" (one of the few remakes where the imitator blows away the originator) and ""Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody"". The other two are fun but inessential songs. No matter what though, this is a pretty steep price for what is essentially a four-song CD single. Three out of these four cuts are available on ""The Best of David Lee Roth"", along with 17 other songs, for only a few bucks more than this one. I would recommend that instead."
2,Bad Value,"The first time I heard ""Just A Gigalo / Aint Got Nobody"" was on the Village People ""Macho Man"" album. Does this mean Dave ripped them off to? I think a thousand acts have covered Gigalo, but ask a hundred people who's song it is, and Diamond Dave will be the version most people know. The line about ""a day when youth will pass away"" is especially poinant given how Dave looks like the Cryptkeeper from Creepshow nowadays. Coconut Grove truly sucks, but the other three songs are great and are on ""The Best"" album, making ""The Best"" a great value and Crazy from the Heat an over proced redundancy. A better use of the silicon in wasted in this CD would be to make a DVD release of the DAMNED VIDEOS to these songs. Gigalo and California Girls are about the videos as much as they are about the music."
1,Buyer Beware!,"When I played the CD it was apparent that the anti-theft feature had been triggered so it skipped, then played real fast, and kept doing this so that all the songs were ruined. This was obviously a USED CD packaged to look new. BEWARE before buying from this vender."
1,creepy,"I bought this book yesterday without reading it first. Once I read it, I'm not about to give this to my kids. It's a creepy depiction of farm life. Phrases like ""your milk-full udders aching"" and ""pushing the food with your thick, wet tongue over and over for hours"" just give me the willies. While I realize it's supposed to be written from the cow's perspective, it just comes off as strange. Even some of the pictures are weird. As a mom, this book makes me uncomfortable."
1,Fraud,"A travesty of entertainment literature. Coverup propaganda for the vicious abuse of farm animals. Luckily, it creates the genuine interest in bovine well-being, and when children realize that they've been misled, hopefully they will react accordingly."
4,Teaching sign language booklet,"This book has lessons for each chapter; Includes a Review, Introduction to New Signs, Exercises & Games, Sentences, and Possible Assignments. This would be a great book for 5-6 graders. Copyright is 1984, but most of material is still current. Signs are smaller drawings with only the word given; Instuctions on how to form the signs are not clear.Received this book, it looked brand new or just used and not moved much. Prompt good,seller."
5,AWESOME,Fantastic. I ordered three books and this book was the first to arrive. No pages bent and the seal was barely broken.
3,A little misleading,"Item was stated as a 2 cd pack but all was put on one cd.Very misleading as im wondering where is the other cd, only to find out it appears that all songs were put on one cd."
